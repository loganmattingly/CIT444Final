39,1298,"Mar 23 2007 	Cheap Hotel near the Tower of London	I stayed in this hotel because it was the cheapest option near the tower of london. The subway tracks are directly behind the hotel so if you are a light sleeper I would not recommend this property. Also I would recommend asking for a room in the front of the building to minimize the noise. For the price, I thought it was a good value. The tower of london, tower bridge and subway stop is less than a mile."
40,1298,"Jan 5 2007 	A below standard hotel. Do not stay here.	Hotel rooms are small and crampt. Staff were extremely unhelpful. I was told I would have a room with a bath but only twin rooms come with baths. doubles only have a shower so I had to make do. Bed was hard, i am suffering from back ache as a result of this. The head board shook every time a train went past on the very near by track, making it difficult to sleep. There were marks that looked like make up on the carpet. Large yellow and orange blobs. Very strange. Egg shell that had been dropped in the hallway took an entire day to be tidied up. Our breakfast order came late and was not what we ordered. During the time we were out and the room was being cleaned one of the key cards for our door was removed from our room, for no good reason and we were left with only one big towel between me and my fiance. When I rang down for another, the receptionist made sure I knew what a hassle it was for her to get another towel so it was a surprise when it turned up five minutes later. Last but not least beams jut out of the wall in the rooms which me and my fiance both bumped into. I now have a huge bump on my head and a aching shoulder. Not suitable at all for children. paid a large amount of money for a sub-standard hotel. I also stayed at the hesperia in london which is much nicer. Go there instead."
41,1298,"Dec 22 2006 	Good value for money	Stayed in London many times with varrying standards of accommodation and price. This hotel was very good value for money so i was a bit dubious. When i first arrived at the hotel i was a bit surprised by the location. Only 5 mins from the tube/tower of London etc but the hotel was down a dark dingy street and the hotel looked like an office block from the outside (obviously been converted) however once in the hotel found it to be very comfortable. Nice clean room with a great bathroom. Although the room overlooked the railway line, it wasn't any problem. In fact it was quite nice to wave to all the commuters first thing in the morning. All n all a nice comfy stay and would go back."
42,1298,Oct 22 2006 	dream room	the location of the hotel was very dissapointing for the hotel. it wasnt a really good look. i had to walk down a very dark alley way which was pretty frightening. other than that the hotel was good the room service was ok. loved the room and it was in really good condition. me and my boyfriend really enjoed and might even come back just has long has we dont have to walk down that dark road.
43,1298,"Sep 15 2006 	Very nice hotel	We stayed here for 3 nights earlier this month and enjoyed our stay. This hotel is conveniently located close to the Tower Hill and Aldgate East Tube station. The room was nice, clean and contemporary. There were a bunch of good restaurants close by. I wish the hotel offered free continental breakfast. I would definitely stay there again."
44,1298,"Sep 13 2006	Very good	Good clean place and location for the price, also in zone one for the undergroundwould stay again as is very new as well"
45,1298,"Aug 3 2006 	Excellent Accommodation!	I could not have gotten a better deal... The room was lovely, the service impeccable, and the price amazing. Stayed 4 nights and had the best sleep despite our room being next to the railway; I did not hear a thing. No, the hotel isn't in central London, but it's only a 5 min walk from the nearest Tube station and just a couple of stops away from all the sights. I had a blast and would definitely stay here again! ~A Traveller from Edinburgh"
46,1298,"Jun 21 2006	Unbeatable value nice hotel	We stayed at the Comfort Tower of London for 3 nights this past May and had an outstanding experience.First, we found an unbelievable rate of 85$/night on Expedia- yes, that is in US dollars, not pounds!This rate was for a King room and included a hearty breakfast every day.The room was fine - it was fairly new and a little small, but that was to be expected to London's standard. I must say that I found the king bed to be a luxury in London. The decor is modern and the bathroom very clean and more than adequate.Compared to all the other options, we felt we got an excellent deal. The hotel is nice, new and modern and the breakfast was definitely several notches above the usual continental fare - there was hot eggs, ham, pastries, yogurt.The only slight downside is the location. It is a bit hard to find and is in a somewhat isolated area. I will emphasize that we found the location to be safe, but if you are looking for a hotel that is on a busy street or lively square, this is not the place. On the plus side, it is located only 2 minutes from the Tower Gateway tube station.Overall, we were extremely satisfied and would stay here again."
47,1298,"Jun 19 2006	Good location good value	Nice hotel, new, clean, big room (contrary to what you hear of European hotels, and not what we found in Athens and Rome), right next to train tracks, but we didn't hear them, ever (sound-proof windows and walls?), lift was broken during our visit. Not the nicest neighborhood (a little run down), but we never felt unsafe walking to and from the Tower Hill underground station (3 blocks away) or the bus stops (2 blocks away, for several major buses). We had a King with a rollaway (for our son) for 62.73 euros a night (booked through their website using the &quot;Internet rate&quot;). Breakfast was not included, but available for 12 euros each in the hotel restaurant. (We choose to do other things with our 12 euros!) Nice curry restaurant down the block - Red Chili."
48,1298,"Jun 15 2006	Not as central as you'd think	I thought it would be better having read the reviews on tripadvisor before I went.It was much further from the Tower of London than I thought which meant a good 10-15 minute walk down some deserted streets. The hotel itself is down an alleyway next door to a garage and with some kind of fish processing place on the same alley.We were there for 3 days on the 8th of June and the lift was out of order for that whole time. I am interested to see if it wil still be broken in future postings. We had the impression they had no intention of fixing it. The walk up three flights of stairs with our suitcases in the heat wasn't much fun but at least the air conditioning in the room was very good. The bedrooms were nicely decorated but the drainage in the shower wasn't the best and they had a notice up saying to be careful because the steam can set off the fire alarm. There is a lot of noise from the train station at the back of the hotel and it woke us early every morning, even though we were up on the third floor. Also beware of the goldy bedspread. I flung myself onto the bed after a hard days shopping and got carpet-burn from it i thought bedspreads were supposed to be soft! :-("
49,1298,"Jun 12 2006	Not much comfort in this hotel	Taxi driver had no idea where the hotel was. When we eventually arrived the receptionist said it was a common problem. The lift was not working so had to carry bags to the second floor, no assistance was offered. The room was clean and adequate but was beside a noisy street so could not open the windows. The air conditioning which was modern simply didn't work. A fan was offered once the staff checked the unit. Breakfast was cold even though I was there when the opened for serving. The internet which was advertised as free on the company booking system was not free either at 3 an hour.Overall an average hotel that is charging above its worth as it is in a poor location with poorly maintained facilities."
50,1298,"Jun 2 2006	Loved the hotel	A great new hotel. It is within walking distance of the Tower Bridge and offers real value for money, if not more. It is very very close to all the London attractions and was a perfect base for our stay in the city. The rooms are very chic and modern with great furnishings and a big shower. The buffet breakfast is superb and the bar service is great as well."
51,1298,"Apr 26 2006	Great hotel	disadvantages if the hotel:# it was fairly hard to find, but by popping into a local sandwich shop we were able to find it. # not that wide varitey on the diner menu (however there are many restraunts localy).# view from our room was the train track. this however was not a problem as the walls were soundproof and you could only hear them if you opened the windows. (trains going past approximately every 15 minutes (but please note this really wasnt a problem, as they were unheard).advantages:# great welcoming to the hotel and we managed to check in 1 hour early. thy were very helpful we gave them the surname and we were in our room within 2 minutes. we took the lift upstairs.# easy access with a modern entrance type swipe card to get into the room.# the hotel room was big enough for 2 which was great, plenty of space for clothes and sky tv with film and msic channels really made the difference. # the beds were slightly uncomfortable (firm) but i was so tired form sightseeing that i fell asleep immediately anyway!# room service was available at 3, which is always a plus (you could even get a paper of your choice delivered to your room after 7 am (anytime wanted) great).# breakfast was included within our price, so much choice. 5 different drinks, cereals, cooked breakfast, toast, baguetts, croissants, fresh fruit. as result of this breakfast i couldnt manage lunch so a good saving of money lol. a real bonus of breakfast was that it was served between 7-10 (mon-fri) and you find a table (always a spare one) and serve yourself everything is up on the table and you cna pick (including cooked breakfast). # the decor throughout the hotel was very modern and clean i could not fault them upon this. # checkout was simple handed back the swipe card and that was it. overall i am very pleased with the hotels good service and for giving me such an enjoyable stay. all the staff were pleasent, and i would strongly recommend this cheap brilliant hotel to anybody."
52,1298,"Mar 16 2006 	Hidden gem	This practically new (7 months in operation) hotel sits just three blocks from Tower Hill underground station and just a short walk from The City, yet its rates are half of what one would expect to pay in that area.This hotel is on a clearly industrial street next to the train tracks and is virtually unknown to most cabbies. Part of the problem is the lack of an external sign, coupled with a noticeable lack of advertising. Nevertheless, we found it without difficulty and we were quite pleased with the hotel itself.This is not the hotel for you if you are looking for Olde English elegance and culture, luxury service or stunning views from your windows. The hotel is part of the Comfort Hotel chain and it delivers budget accomodations that are comfortable and much better than average.Rooms are modern and being new, clean and bright, as were the nicely-tiled bathrooms. For the price, the rooms were bigger than we expected. To our surprise, the walls are apparently sound-proofed, as we never heard out neighbors even though the hotel was mostly filled.Breakfast was more than adequate and the staff were extremely courteous and helpful. We were on a business trip and the location was perfect for us. It would likely suit tourists as well, given the proximity of the Tower of London and the Underground. Our only complaint were the beds, which we found to be overly-firm. If you like that type of mattress, you will have no complaints.Considering that we paid less than $200.00 a night (even less on the weekend) it is hard to imagine finding a better value in that part of London. We will be returning in the future."
53,1298,"Mar 6 2006	Towering value	Went to this hotel expecting little for the 60 rate that I understood to include only continental breakfast.It is located 10 min walk from Tower Hill tube but suffers from an approach down a rather dingy darkish alley that luckliy quickly turns into a better lit street. Could easily go a little bit further on and approach it down a better lit main street.The back of the hotel looks onto rail track intersection so there was some noise from passing trains, but cant say I found this too much of a problem.All that said the experience inside the hotel was much better.Helpful staff, nice good sized clean room, modern decor and good breakfast - not just continental but also full english. We were also able to leave our luggage in the hotel after checking out whilst we spent a few hours going round the Tower of London.For the money and location I thought it was very good value and would recommend it."

1,1301,Nov 23 2009 	Good value	Me and my partner have just stayed at this Travelodge whilst visiting the tennis at the o2.I was a bit weary about leaving my mini in the hotel carpark after reading previous reviews about carpark secruity and having walked to the all night shop around the corner I can see that the carpark could be better protected by a fence.We parked outside the front widow of the reception and had no problems.When we got to our room it was very clean and the bed was comfortable though take your earplugs due to the aircraft taking off.Overall the staff where helpfull and its very convenient for the o2 arena.
2,1301,"Nov 10 2009 	Avoid if possible	Arrived at 2pm to be charged an extra GBP10 for ''early check-in''. Room okay and clean, certainly devoid of any toiletries, shampoo etc... The lead in price of GBP19 rocketed to GBP99 as there was a conference on at Excel, which was my only reason to stay there.There are plenty of other hotels in the area so if you get the chance, stay somewhere else."
3,1301,"Oct 18 2009 	Comfortable value	We stayed here on 29th August, having booked their 19 room deal, which is fantastic value for London. The bedroom and bathroom was clean, the bed was comfortable and there were Tea/Coffee facilities in the room. This Travelodge also has a bar/restaurant and although we didnt use it looked good value  full English costing about 7. We wondered if it was a bit out of the way, wanting to visit the West End, but really the DLR makes it so easy. We experienced none of the rowdiness that you may get from late night clubbers in the city and being a weekend there were no planes from the small airport to disturb the peace either.The next night we stayed at Travelodge Tower Bridge and found the room there more cramped - no bedside table, just a cup size slot in the headboard and the desk/dressing table was much smaller - and a bit more down at heal. In preference, Id definitely choose to stay at Travelodge London City Airport."
4,1301,"Sep 9 2009 	Surprisingly good!	We were a bit worried having read the previous recent reviews, but from the moment we arrived all staff from reception to the bar to the chambermaids were great - very friendly and professional.We parked our car, which is not posh I should add(!), in view of reception, under a light, and it remained intact throughout our 2 night stay at a weekend.10 minutes walk to City Airport DLR station which connects pretty well with central London lines, but the underground does seem to have a lot of closures/works, so be prepared for thinking on your feet with regards to changes of lines etc.Hotel comfortable, bed ok, clean room and bathroom - request for more T bags was no problem, so all in all for 50 for 2 nights at a weekend, you can't really ask for more."
5,1301,"Aug 25 2009 	What a stay! Not Impressed!	After arriving at 3.30am, we booked in to only find that we were ignored as there was a pizza delivery for the reception staff. The wrong info given to us about the pay and display car park out side and no help with getting change for this.Woke up to find out our friends car had beeen broken into and on inspection, found inadequate CCTV covering the car park (my husbands a fire/security expert so he was not impressed) and broken glas all ove the car park from previous break in's. Their plight was not helped when we found out several cars had been broken into in that car park over the week. Totally unimpressed with the breakfast as I later found the I had food poisoning from the breakfast which just set it in stone never to return there again.We had a family room which didn't have the bed made up for our son and not enough towels or pillows let alone sheets!I'll never be booking this hotel again and will not reccommend it to anyone else and will make an official complaint to Travel Lodge office."
6,1301,"Aug 24 2009 	Vandalism Ignorance blind staff unhelpful	Recent 4 night stay, accommodation usual Travelodge standard, staff unhelpful and in no hurry to serve either at reception or at the bar. Car parked in car park with security camera costing 5 per 24hours. Second morning car found to have passenger side front window smashed and glove box open( very stupidley left sat nav in there) sat nav gone!! Reported to Travelodge reception said it was not thier problem car park managed by a company, company unhelpful as said they had offered Travelodge same security as at sister Travelodge in London Docklands but Travelodge had refused! Our's not the only car to have had this happen another family had suffered the same. Police and Autoglass repair man both said that it was a regular occourance that there are at least 3+ in this car park a week and more in the surrounding &quot;traveller&quot;hotels. Police had set decoy cars with tracker sat navs as bait found the the perpitraitors only to have another &quot;gang&quot; start on the area. Staff asked why there were no warning signs of problem, regarded it as not a travelodge problem. I am also led to belive that the marks on your windscreen attaract these thieves along with any identifcation that you are &quot;just passing through&quot; eg. country car stickers, hire car stickers, permits from your home town, car trinkets that sit on your dash board. Regardless of the sat nav being taken they would have smashed the glass anyway hoping to strike lucky and they did. Will never stay in this area again, be very aware if you are planning to stay here."
7,1301,"Aug 24 2009 	CRIME CENTRAL-Budget Hotel with Serious Security Issues	This is a typical Travelodge -Cheap value accomodation.The location next to the City Airport and DLR station is convenient for travelling to the hotel and into central London.Travelodge need to do something about staff training as attitude is less than helpful in most cases.DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU ARE PARKING A CAR!!!!!!The most serious issue with this hotel is security in the car park at night.We went down to our car at 5am in the morning with the intention to drive to Alton Towers with the kids. We found our car and another had been broken into- Smashed passenger window and contents of glove box removed in search of Sat Navs. Reported to staff at reception who stated that it was a regular occurrence. &quot;it always happens to the parts of the car park which can't be seen from reception.&quot; CSI attended scene several hours later reported that this was a regular stop for him. The Autoglass guy told us that this car park generated a huge amount of work for the company. &quot;look around the car park and you can see the evidence yourself-fragments of glass from the numerous incidents&quot; Don't let the camera fool you into thinking that this is secure.This issue could be resolved by having a fence around the edge of the grounds to limit access to the main entrance which could be monitored from reception and until this happens stay away from this hotel if you are parking a car. It cost us 50 excess on our insurance, 114 for forfeited prepaid tickets for Alton Towers, A nasty 5hr journey up the M6 on a Friday afternoon with a piece of plastic in the window and four distraught children."
8,1301,"Aug 24 2009 	Regular car break-ins - window smashed. Not impressed!!	We stayed at this Travelodge as we were working at Indigo2 on the Saturday night. Checked in at 3.15am Sunday morning after telling the hotel by phone we would be late - no problem and excellent service at that time of morning.Problem was that my car was broken into at 5.30am, the passenger door window was smashed. After informing the hotel management - it was a case of embarassed acceptance that it had happened many times before, its now a case of when next and they even know who the culprits are (read young hoodies) that come regularly on their pushbikes at that time of morning, seems they are after SatNavs - mines built in. The hotel security cameras are useless and do not cover the whole car park - guess where they target cars?.We waited five hours for the glass repairers - very busy as they had six similar cases that morning in the area at the budget hotels. I detect a theme here....... and the broken glass seen in daylight all over the car park tells a story - even in front of reception.Back to the hotel - grubby bar/breakfast area - the chairs and carpet were stained and there was some long term filth on the worktops. The stale smell turned out to be the guys use of a filthy mop on the serving area floor - not once did he wash it or use hot water/soap for the whole place!! The tables had that dirty cloth wiped look to them.Not impressed!!"
9,1301,"Jul 27 2009 	Second-rate	My sole purpose was in having a night stopover before taking an early business flight the next day from the nearby airport. It is not a 5 minute walk, more like 15 minutes, which makes a difference if it is raining, which it was. Poorly signposted for a pedestrian, if at all. The dreary, middle-aged woman at the desk was sulky, harrassed and rude. I was just a piece of meat to be processed as quickly as possible. I tried to crack a joke - no response whatsoever. Nearby, there was a young, black member of staff flicking coins monotonously into a drawer. After a long, stressful day, I found this really irritating. I was then given directions at 2000 miles an hour as to where to go, &quot;to the end and then right&quot;. I thought I caught the gist of it, but she was already engrossed in the next customer in the queue. I headed off, but was then bellowed at by some of the idle staff standing by - &quot;Heellllooooooo!!!!!!!!&quot;. No, excuse me, sir, this is the way to the lifts.Yes, no frills, but blimey surely a bare minimum degree of customer service is needed????"
10,1301,"Jul 25 2009 	Vandalism Microwave Food Un-proffesional Staff Attitude	Arrived at the lodge after a simple trip by car, enter the street name and city into Tom Tom as the postcode takes you on a lovely view of the Thames Barrier. The receptionist was ignorant, arrogant and was more interested in her mobile phone than the people waiting to check in. The room was adequate and of the normal Travelodge standard, TV picture was very weak but the sound levels were ok to drown out the DLR railway outside of my window. After a relaxing shower, very good, I ventured to the bar and ordered my food, soup and a burger, both microwaved, luke warm and very bland. I asked politely if the food could be warmed up and it was returned with boiling hot salad..... A good nights sleep was had and ready for the next day I returned to my car to find the passenger window knocked out and my glove box turned over (nothing of value left in the car overnight) as well as 4 other cars in the well lit car park, 5.00 for 24hrs. I returned to reception to be told that &quot;its happening all the time, there is nothing we can do&quot;. The police were called at 2am and I have a crime number, what I find amazing is that my car was in view of the reception but nothing was seen by the on duty receptionist ???? it was only the car alarms which alerted staff. I asked would it not be prudent to alert customers to the ongoing situation so at least steps could be taken to minimise the chance of break ins, ie: cleaning windscreens of Tom Tom bracket marks etc and to my amazement to receive the comment &quot;if we tell customers they won't stay again&quot; not wrong there einstein. To top off my day I was late for my meeting, did not win the contract and drove north with a plastic window in torrential rain for company and have a replacement bill of over 250.00 for the window. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO MY WORST ENEMY."
11,1301,"Jul 24 2009 	Nice and convenient	Usual Travelodge experience - very reasonably priced with basic, clean rooms. It is really easy to catch the DLR from this hotel at just a short 10 minute walk to the nearest station, London City Airport. Convenient for the 02 Arena and other attractions near London Docklands. Costs 5 per day to park just outside the hotel. OverallI would recommend this hotel if you want no frills and a cheap night in London."
12,1301,"Jul 13 2009	Would never stay here again	Where to begin? First of all, too far out of the city. The DLR is in walking distance, but still a pain to get into the city. Second, no phones in the room, no alarms and none of the staff knew how to set the alarms on the tv (the remotes did not synch with the tvs), so kind of a pain getting up in the morning when you don't have your own alarm. It was clean and decent, but the staff was rude and everything was very bare and sparse. Not good for London tourists."
13,1301,"Jun 9 2009 	clean and comfortable	i agree with previous review , stayed here as good price and was going to 02 arena not much else around but a good clean comfortable base easy to get to 02 and back about 40mins into west end all easy routes , standerd travelodge rooms but ok and clean would stay here again good value"
14,1301,"Jun 1 2009 	Basic clean undistinctive value.	This Travelodge is 15 minute walk or one bus stop to the London City Airport, and easily accessible from the Underground through Canning Town station and bus 474 to street in front of hotel (DLR stops 20 minute walk away) LCA offers inexpensive fares to the rest of Europe ($50 to Amsterdam in my case). There are no pubs, restaurants nearby in this semi-industrial area, but a dining/drinking facility in the hotel. Hotel and rooms are clean, simple, secure, modern. Recommended among the number of iffy London inexpensive hotels. WIFI report: Ripoff alert! On booking the room I was encourged to pre-pay for a certain time of WIFI access during my stay. Problem was it wasn't cumulative, so when I used just 20 minutes of the hour I had signed up for the hour was gone. Hotel desk said they had no control over it because it was run by another company. Internet access in the lobby was much cheaper than in the room @ L1 for 20:00. I have demanded a refund from Travelodge."
15,1301,May 28 2009 	best for stop over	The hotel is just 5 mins walk to the airport. It is a budget hotel in the airport area. The room is ok and basic. Staff is not very helpful but it is ok if you are just stop over.
16,1301,"May 21 2009 	Adds new meaning to the word 'dire'	Go up to London by train, have a nice meal in the west end then take the tube to the convenient hotel right by the airport. Enjoy a good night's sleep and in the morning a leisurely stroll to get our flight.. ...or so we thought. We got off the tube at London City Airport after 11pm to find ourselves in a dark, quiet car park with no sign of any hotels. We wandered about with our luggage in tow looking lost for while until we saw a cab. The driver knew the hotel (of course) but suggested that it was a fair walk considering our luggage, so we jumped in.The hotel was, I suppose 'within walking distance' of the airport (when you think about it, that doesn't mean very much) but the next day's slog of a walk dragging suitcases rendered the description somewhat optimistic, to say the least.The hotel itself was exactly what you'd expect for a budget hotel in a business area, cleary designed by an architect whose previous projects had included prisons and abattoirs - but that was ok, after all, we were just there to sleep. Ah yes, sleep.At about 2 am there was much slamming of doors and shouting in the corridor. There was no phone in the room to alert reception (although I'd have thought that they should have been able to hear the noise anyway) so after waiting a reasonable amount of time in the hope that the racket would end, I pulled on my dressing gown and ventured out. I was faced with a group of 5 or 6 youths, clearly quite drunk, having an enthusiastic debate about the promiscuous nature of one of the girls in the group. This involved the girl shouting and swearing incessantly at the boys, who returned the compliments en masse. Somewhat nervously I asked them to stop and to my amazement, they agreed. I returned to my room. Half an hour went by before it all went off again  only this time with much greater ferocity. Once again I donned my robe and ventured out  this time to be confronted by about a gang of about 20, lining the corridor and jeering you gonna complain, eh mistah? and making a few inaccurate suggestions about my parenthood and sexuality. I decided to proceed nonetheless and made my way (in as calm and dignified a manner as I could muster in my robe) to reception. I was greeted by the sight of several other guests, all in their robes, all complaining of the same disturbance throughout the hotel. The receptionist was dealing with the problem by crying a lot and promising that we would all be reimbursed (which of course, never happened). Eventually she agreed to call the police so I made my way back through the jeering gang towards my room. By now it was well past 4am.We got up at six. I had had NO sleep, my adrenaline level was through the roof and all I had to look forward to was the walking distance endurance march to the airport.Never again."
17,1301,"May 4 2009 	Going downhill all the time...	I have stayed at this hotel quite a few times - it's the only hotel within walking distance of London City Airport, and very convenient for those early flights.I had no complaints about the hotel on my first few stays - I don't expect luxury at a Travelodge, and I found this hotel entirely adequate. Clean, well-maintained rooms. A bar serving basic but entirely palatable food. My one complaint was the fact that they don't start serving breakfast until 7 am, which is far too late for an airport hotel.However, on my last few stays I noticed a distinct deterioration - the hotel wasn't as clean as it used to be, and both food and service in the bar seemed to have gone downhill. And when I stayed there last week things had got so bad that, despite the convenience, I seriously doubt I will ever stay there again.There were hygiene issues - we had to get the quilt exchanged because of stains (disgusting-looking stains!) both on the cover and on the quilt itself. The bar was filthy - none of the tables had been cleared, and there was food on the floor. When we asked staff if it would be possible to clear some tables (there were several people waiting to sit down) the reply was &quot;No, we're too busy&quot;. And they clearly were... from what we could see there were all of four people on duty, to look after a large hotel that was fully booked and man the bar and restaurant. When we asked to speak to the manager we were told that she wasn't available to speak to customers because she was busy cooking!To top it all, when we were finally able to order food (we had to wait about 20 minutes to be served at the bar) we were told to expect a wait of at least 90 minutes - and this was well after 9 pm. We ended up just ordering a glass of wine and a bag of crisps.Staff attitudes also left a lot to be desired - the receptionist was brilliant, but everybody else seemed surly and rude, especially the guy behind the bar. But maybe they were just overworked?The whole thing was a complete shambles. I don't really blame the staff on duty, I blame the management who only rostered four people when they surely must have known that the hotel was fully booked."
18,1301,"Apr 25 2009 	absolute gem!!!	just returned from here after a 1 night stay and found this to be a little gem of a hotel.managed to bag 2 rooms with breakfast @ 24 each and was very happy with everything, i mainly stay in Hilton's and novotels on my travels but saw this on the web at travelodge site and decided to give it a try.i arrived with a mate at 3.30pm parked in the car-park ( 5 per 24 hours) and check in was swift and friendly , took lift to 3rd floor to rooms 308 and 306 which has views to the rear of hotel over a train line and industrial park, was still pleasant though.after returning at around midnight we walked back from d.l.r stop to hotel which seemed quite safe and well lit, slept well and bed was comfy and big, the room itself was clean and large it also had a very powerful heaterthe bathroom was again quite big with a fantastic shower that was very powerful ( loved this), the next morning we had breakfast of which was hot and cold buffet style, this was plentiful and delicious.we went for a walk afterwards over the bridge to the other side of airport and watched the planes take off and land...... this was fun!!, gonna bring the kids down next time as they would love this and its free, and very close!to round it off had very nice stay and cannot fault the place and at 24 was a bargain!, will return v. soon."
19,1301,"Apr 8 2009 	good clean cheap hotel	This Travel Lodge is located right next to the City Airport in the east of London Docklands area. It is close to the 02 area and the Excel exhibition centre and the Light Railway station is about 10 min walk way which will take you into Central London within about 40 mins.Hotel is quite quiet, room was modern with TV, bathroom small but clean with a full bath and shower.There is on site car parking for 5 a night. Breakfast was extra at 7.50 eat all you can buffet style of full English and continental.Only bad thing was the bed was rather hard and bouncy!"
20,1301,"Mar 9 2009 	easy acess to o2	Fairly new but usual travelodge fayre, managed to get a room on a saturday night for 29 pounds. We were going to the o2 and was alot cheaper than the other hotels around the arena. The 474 bus stops right outside and is only 5-6 minutes to Canning town station and then one stop on the jubilee line to the o2 (the bus runs every 12 minutes). also ideal for the airport and although close heard no noise. Basic but would use again"
21,1301,"Jan 10 2009 	Fine hotel and great value	I agree with the other positive comments about this property and just wanted to add mine about the public transport available. If you take the DLR, you take the one headed toward King George and get off at the London City Airport stop. From there, you can, of course, walk to the property or take either the 473 or 474 buses toward Stratford or Canning Town respectively and get off at the first stop which is directly in front of the hotel. You can also go to Canning Town and take the 474 bus the other direction at stop at the Connaught Street stop which is the one in front of the hotel and about a 10 minute bus ride from Canning Town. The 473 goes in another direction after the Travelodge, so the 474 is your only option in this direction."
22,1301,"Jan 10 2009 	Perfect for a break in cheap London.	We booked this Travelodge in a 19 a night promotion, costing us 38 for a two night stay (without breakfast).On arrival the Travelodge was very quiet, the receptionist was efficient and we were soon in our rom, which was spotlessly clean.Although we booked a family room, there was no linen for the bed-settee, but this was soon remedied by a trip to reception. We also only had one hand and one bath towel. There was no problem obtaining a hairdryer at reception one evening.The room was practical and clean, and we were on the ground floor, overlooking the carpark, and airport runway. We heard no noise from either the car park, road or airport tospeak of. No planes take offor land at night.It costs 5 for 24 hours for parking in teh car park. We booked this directly with Britannia car parks from a number teh receptionist gave us.We travelled into London each day - we walked for approx 10mins to London city airport , caught the DLR to Canning Town and changed onto the Jubilee line into London. It took 55 mins approx in total to get to Hyde Park.The only downside to this hotal is the bar-cafe. It is expensive for what you get and the service was appalling in our experience. I ordered a jacket potato with chilli &amp; salad, my husband ordered burger, chips and salad. We were told they had no salad!!!! We could pick any other side order instead for free - onion rings or garlic dough balls - hardly a substitute for a salad!We didnt take breakfast at the hotel, but it looked very busy in the morning.All in all, you cant complain for 19 a night, and they've got some rooms this summer at 9. I dont thing I would pay any more than 20 though!!!Ideal for a cheap trip to the capital."
23,1301,"Dec 11 2008 	Absolutely fine especially for LCY	I paid 32 for a night here (come on! 32!) to stay within 10 minutes walk from London City airport. It was absolutely fine. Reception were efficient and polite, the room was equipped with everything I needed - bathroom (with bath, shower, toilet, sink), TV, tea/coffee making facilities, comfortable bed. There was no disturbing noise from the airport. It was very clean. I don't think you can ask for more than that for 32, and it meant I could avoid risking using British trains to get to the airport for an early flight. (In fact it was cheaper too - an advanced purchase train ticket the previous evening and a night in the hotel were cheaper than the astronomical sum I would have had to pay for an unreliable train early in the morning) And this is *much* better than the nearby ETAP hotel. I shall be using this hotel again if I fly from London City airport."
24,1301,"Nov 26 2008 	Very Impressed	As someone who doesn't normally stay in travelodge hotels, I was very impressed.We chose this hotel on the basis of its location as we were flying from London City Airport the following day. The hotel is only 5 minutes walk from the DLR stop (10 min with luggage!). Even at night the walk felt safe as it was well lit.Check-in was quick and efficient and we were given a room on the top floor. Security at the hotel was very good as you needed your room key to open the door to the lift area.The room was large with plenty of room for luggage/bags etc. As we were on the opposite side of the hotel to the Airport, we heard no aircraft noise. The room was also very clean.Overall, an excellent hotel for London City Airport."
25,1301,"Nov 4 2008 	Good clean hotel but don't eat there	This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and it is really good, especially at 29 a night. Lovely comfortable beds, Spotless bathroom. Infact the whole hotel was spotless. Good transport links as well, Just get the 474 bus to Canning Town Tube Station and you will be in the centre of London in less than 20 minutes.The only letdown was the food Nearly broke my teeth on the chiabatta bread that came with my soup. Plus it is pricy as well. Would have given it 5 stars otherwise.I would stay there again."
26,1301,"Oct 26 2008 	There are more convenient options	My travels seem destined to acquaint me with the totality of Travelodges in London, and this time it was City Airport's turn.Honestly the only functionality I can see to this hotel is, a clean, cheap and safe place to sleep if you are not planning to do anything in central London that evening or the next morning. Not being able to check in before 3 PM, the idea of venturing back onto the tube at rush hour was not appealing: and you'd be hard pressed to go anywhere the following morning and get back to the room before the 12 o'clock checkout.There is literally nothing in the area around the hotel except a petrol station with a small shop. Nearest Tesco was Canary Wharf and after reading what others have written about the hotel food, I went there around 7 to have a pint and pick up some snacks for the room. But the travel connections are unappealing. There is a bus stand directly in front of the hotel, but buses pass infrequently and then it's 15 minutes to Canning Town Tube/DLR, with a further ride onto anywhere worth going.There are (usually) more convenient options at the same price and within the same chain.Having said all that - room was the usual clean, comfortable travelodge, and I did get an excellent night's sleep, so... thanks!"
27,1301,Oct 24 2008 	Don`t eat there !	Inability to use &quot;microwave&quot; (think this is what is used as no chef/cook would send out food like this) means most of evening meals are served only just warm and not hot! Otherwise Travelodge OK
28,1301,"Oct 17 2008 	OK it's cheap but....	.. you get what you pay for.I was looking for a hotel conveniently close to London City Airport so I could easily catch an early morning flight. It is located 5-10 minutes walk from the airport (depending how fast you walk); but too close to take a taxi. However, not a pleasant walk, mostly along dimly lit footpaths and under railway bridges. I wouldn't recommend it at night to people with a nervous disposition.I checked into the hotel about 7pm. Only one person on reception, and a queue of 5-6 people which it took about 20 minutes to process. Not sure why but the check-in process was very slow. When I got to my room the first thing I noticed was the smell of wet carpet; seems like someone had tipped the contents of the kettle onto the floor. Under normal circumstances I would have asked for another room, but was in a hurry to go out to an evening function and could not afford time to wait in the reception queue for another 20 minutes.When i got back to the hotel later that evening (about 11pm) my card key no longer worked. Again only one person on reception and only one person in front of me, but it took 10-15 minutes to &quot;process&quot; him (part of the problem was that the hotel had run out of card keys) before I could get my card key re-set and to get into my smelly room. The best thing I can say is that the reception staff are very polite... I guess they have to be to placate frustrated guests."
29,1301,Oct 1 2008 	Dont leave it late for Breakfast!	Used this hotel as a base for visiting a West End show. Location much easier to locate by road than the nearby Travelodge Docklands. Ten minute walk to Pontoon Dock for DLR then change to Jubilee Line for Central London. Room &amp; check in fine but regretted decision for late breakfast on the Saturday morning. Most of the cooked food had been consumed and staff attitude regarding provision of replacement provisions was unhelpful to say the least. 'We only have one person cooking and we are doing our best 'was the answer. My opinion is that they are understaffed in the kitchen department and the facility is not large enough for the number of guest rooms available. All in all glad we only paid 29 night thanks to early pre-booking.
30,1301,"Jul 23 2008 	Dreadful!	We stayed here for easy access to central London at a reasonable price as we are a large young family and needed 2 rooms for 3 nights, but regretted it the moment we arrived.The 3rd bed in each room was not made and Reception told us bluntly that it was hotel policy for guests to make their own beds. We had to ask for sheets as none were provided but were given dirty ones from a bin liner. We took them back and were eventually given clean ones but it was late and the kids were beyond tired after having travelled all day. We then noticed that the sheets on one of the double beds were also dirty and had to go and ask for clean ones again and change the bed ourselves. Throughout this whole fiasco no apology was offered and blame was placed on the laundry man , whoever that was. The next morning my wife was getting her breakfast when the man in charge shouted at her from across the room to &quot;put it back, you're not allowed it, you're part of the group!&quot; Everyone was staring and my wife had to explain that we were not part of any group and we had prepaid for our breakfast. He started shouting at her to produce her breakfast ticket which she did but felt very harassed by this point.Would recommend a youth hostel rather than this place. Will definitely not stay in a Travelodge again."
31,1301,"Jun 21 2008 	Ok For Work	I paid 100 room only per night then had to pay 5 to park overnight which I found rather money grabbing. Surely if you actually stay at the hotel you should be able to park for free?I had a room on the airport side which wasn't as noisy as I thought it would be and probably a nicer view of the airport, the docks and Excel than that on the other side of the Docklands Railway viaduct.The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. From my bed I could see the planes flying past, not for everyone maybe?!The staff I met all seemed friendly and check in was fast.I thought that the bar and restaurant prices were expensive for what you got ,so I would reccomend that you bring your own, both food and drink. Being a Travelodge, the staff don't mind you bringing takeaways in and I had a good laugh with the receptionists when my pizza arrived as they said it looked far too large for just one person! A short walk away is a small rank of shops and a service station.The location is good for the City Airport, Excel and the Woolwich ferry, but if I was a tourist I would probably want to stay closer to the centre of London. Then again, you can't park in central London for 5 so all in all not a bad place to stay especially if you get a discount rate, unlike me.I would return if I needed accomodation in the area but there is a large choice of similar hotels close by so you can shop around for the best price."
32,1301,"Jun 21 2008	okay for one night	Stayed here last August for the ROLLING STONES concert at the hotel, and could not get checked in until 17.00, so with this in mind, I arrived there at about 19.30, as I was staying in London for one night, on the way back from a trip to Derry, and had things to do and people to see in London the next morning.The weather was awful, so opted to eat in the hotel, instead of eating out.....The bar no longer does beers on draught, only in cans and bottles. I asked for a can of beer and a glass of white wine and she said &quot;I only have red by the glass&quot; so i pointed to a bottle of white in the fridge and asked her why i couldn't have a glass and she said &quot;Because we sell it by the bottle&quot; so I asked her where they get the red wine from to sell it by the glass and she said &quot;oh from a bottle I opened earlier! SO why they would open a red, and not a white, I really don't know! Waited ages for the food order, and the dessert arrived before the main course, but the waiter soon sorted the problem out, and gave us a drink on the house to make up for the mix up, which was a nice gesture on his part!Room was clean and tidy with a good view of the nearby airport runway and thanks to the double glazing, you could not hear a thing, so a goodnights sleep was insured!Breakfast in the morning was nice, as always, and David the Vietnamese breakfast supervisor, was an asset to the place, as always!"
33,1301,"Jun 4 2008 	Great value for money	It was a few miles from central London.with a good bus service to a local tube station, (Canning Town, on the Jubilee Line.) The room was comfortable but basic."
34,1301,May 15 2008 	Excellent Value - Great location !!	I recently stayed here for 3 nights Location - Excellently located right by London City Airport Check in - Was quick and easy Room - Very large room - Very clean and tidy !!Bathroom - Typical Travelodge hotel bathroom Check out - I just dropped my room card in the postbox - I had asked for a late checkout so therefore had to pay the 10 Travelodge charge Restuarant - Impatient supervisor - He seemed very rude to me - Nice none the lessOverall - Very nice - booked in December for 29 a night for 3 nights = 87 - Would DEFINATELY stay here again !!-----I stayed here prior to attending the Tutankhamun exhibition and Celine Dion concert at The 02 ( The Dome )To get to The 02 - Go to the airport - get a oyster card - travel on the DLR ( Docklands Light Railway ) Travel from London City Airport to Canning Town - Change there then go on the Jubilee Line - The 02 is about 10 minutes travelling time from the airport !! - For travel to the London Eye / Big Ben / Houses of Parliment - Get the Jubilee line tube to Westminister and your in the beating heart of Londons tourist sights
35,1301,"May 15 2008 	Disaster	Arrived back at the room at midnight following an anniversary night out to find our card key wouldn't work, nor would the replacement key nor the masterkey offered by reception. We were told that an engineer couldn't be contacted until the following day. After an hour of arguing with reception and sitting on the hotel corridor floor, an engineer was called and we eventually got back into our room. The level of customer service we experienced was terrible. The following morning, the bathroom totally flooded which seems to be a theme in Travelodge accomodation! Nightmare."
36,1301,"May 12 2008 	Plain but functional	After some problems finding the hotel (based on Google Map's directions, not the hotel's) I was relieved to find the hotel to be quite good all round.My room was bigger than I expected and was relatively clean however I did suspect one of the towels to be already used. The bed was very comfortable though.My room overlooked the City Airport run way, so every minute or so a plane would vibrate the room as it flew past the window - disconcerting at first. The staff were very good, attentive and polite which was great. The food was very mixed quality - I would avoid the Chicken Arabiatta as the chicken is like hard lumps and is inedible."
37,1301,"May 7 2008 	wonderfull!	Travelodge was a marvellous place to stay and to London standards,the hotel was not expensive to stay at.Only 75 avarage a night for a family room supplied with even coffee and lcd-tv set.we enjoyed our stay very much,London is a beautiful place to see and the public transport connections there are so good!every 12 minutes a bus to Canning Town where we changed to the Jubilee line,just 30 minutes right to the center of London!Especially ,I want to mention David the Vietnamese man,the guy that worked so brilliant all alone ,to please the costumers to make very nice continental and English breakfast.We talked for a while and I was pleased to meet him!!for sure I will come when I'm in London,to Travelodge London City Airport!!!from the Koopen family,Enkhuizen ,Netherlands."
38,1301,"May 4 2008	Great value for money	My wife and I booked this hotel for 4 nights (18-22/4/08) @29 per night after returning from Scotland, and before flying back to Australia. We actually stayed in Edinburgh on the night of the 18th, but because we were flying into London City Airport at 9.00am on the 19th all we had to do was ring the hotel on the evening of the 18th and they checked us in and had our keycard ready and waiting for us at reception when we arrived the next morning. (Travelodge policy is they will cancel your booking if you have not checked in on the first day of your booking  even if it is a non-refundable booking  learnt that one the hard way). We preferred this rather than going to the hassle of finding somewhere to store our luggage until check-in at 3pm. 29 for the room was only marginally dearer than 4 x 6.50 to leave our bags at Left Luggage at one of the Rail Stations. It was great to be able to get into the room straight away, shower and get into fresh clothes and then head out for our Premier League game.We used the bus everyday to go to Canning Town Underground station to get into London  very easy. Because its a new hotel, the rooms are all great  clean and in good repair. Due to it being basically in the middle of nowhere, we had breakfast in the dinning room every morning and had no complaints. One morning we chose to have a sleep in and only went down 30 minutes before breakfast finished and they had run out of bacon, but other than that can not fault the breakfast at all. Its fun watching the aeroplanes arriving at the airport across the road.Evening meal in the dinning room  well thats another matter. We decided to give it a try on our last night and it was a bit of a shambles. To start with, the computerised cash register was playing up and had to be rebooted, so they couldnt take orders for about 15 or 20 minutes. When we browsed through the menu we decided to play it safe and order Lasagne and a Chicken Tika Massala  sorry we dont have any after asking for a few other items and being told they didnt have those either, we finally had a win with a Ham and Pineapple pizza. We were so tired and hungry we didnt really care, but some of the other customers were getting quite irate with the staff about the lack of available menu items. When the pizza did arrive, it was obviously straight out of the freezer, so it still amazes me the rest of the menu items werent in the freezer as well. The dinning room manger (if there was one) would have been better off collecting up the menus and just putting up a sign listing meals that WERE available. Its a real shame, because everything else about the hotel was great and it certainly isnt enough to stop me from returning. Just find somewhere else for your evening meal. Transport links are good. The Thames Barrier is just a few minutes walk away (we could see it from our room) and is worth a look. The triple glazing really works because we could not hear ANY noise from the airport.Overall- a great budget hotel with good transport links."
39,1301,"Apr 11 2008 	Basic but very comfortable good quality for money a bit far from downtown	There are now 3 times I have been staying at London City Airport Travelodge bcs the 1st time I was there I felt like at home so I decided I will definitely to elect it as my favorite hotel in London.Although it's about 40/45 minutes far from Central London (Oxford Street/Marble Arch) it's so funny to take the Central Line to Bank and then change to DLR until LCY, then u can choose between a 10 minutes walk or to a 1 minute ride on bus 473/474 to reach the hotel.It's a very new building opened on Dec 4th 2005, so everything is good and the locaton is nice, in front of LCY runway.This is spectacular while having breakfast in the morning with the a/c's taking off and landing just out of the window, but it's absolutely not noisy during nighttime other than the windows are anti-acoustic.The rooms are basic and essential, but equally large and very comfortable to stay. The beds are very good and I always sleep very well there.There is a satellite tv and tea-coffee making facilities available.The heating/air conditioned works very good.The staff has been always very nice and friendly and warm welcoming.The breakfast is a buffet and u can eat as u want, everything is so good and well cooked.There is also a car parking available but I've never used it bcs I was there without a car.I will stay there again and again :))"
40,1301,"Mar 31 2008	Room OK. Pity About the Breakfast	I booked the hotel a few months in advance, and got a good deal (29 for the room, breakfast extra.) It was a few miles from central London, but near DLR stations, and also with a good bus service to a local tube station, (Canning Town, on the Jubilee Line.)The room was comfortable but basic, and generally clean, although I doubt that the skirting baords had been dusted for at least a fortnight, ditto the top of the wardrobe.Breakfast was another matter. I had paid in advance, 6.75 a day. (7.50 if you pay on the day.) On the first morning, when I arrived, I was told that bacon &amp; saussages would be about 5 minutes 20 minutes later, the bacon appeared. All in, I was there for 45 minutes, and didn't see a single saussage. The member of staff in charge was constantly running around like a headless chicken, whilst actually doing very little. Over 4 days, nothing ever got replenished unless somebody told him that it had run out, whereas a competent member of staff would have monitored supply and replenished without being prompted. I.E. on day 1, I had to ask for bread. 5 minutes previously, there had only been 6 slices, and a crowded dining room, so it was obvious that we were about to run out. Day 4, I had to ask for cups, then when they came, I had to ask him to fill the coffee machine; I saw another guest requesting more BUTTER, and then having to explain that what was currently available was MARGARINE, which is not the same thing. Also, for reasons best known to the hotel staff, the butter and margarine were always at the opposite end of the bufet to the bread and the jam, which was inconvenient as well as illogical.The man &quot;in charge&quot; kept coming and asking if everything was all right; in principal, this was a good thing. However, if you came to breakfast at a quiet time, he would come round aproximately every 2 minutes, which was extremely irritatingThe menu was:CerealsFruit JuiceTinned Oranges &amp; Grapefruit, although on day 4, they had completely run out of oranges.BaconSaussages, although not on day 1; they were pretty inedible the rest of the time.Scrambled Egg, which tasted like it was made from powder.Baked Beans, Tinned Tomatoes and Mushrooms (boiled?)Bread (Propper loaves, brown only on day 1, white as well on other days.)Butter, Cheap Margarine and Tasteless Jam.CroissantsChocolate Muffins (not on day 1)Tea and Coffee; there were 2 machines, one of which was permenantly out of order, besides it would have been completely inaccessible if anybody had been using the other one.From the items not present on certain days (white bread, saussages, oranges, chocolate muffins... I would guess that the kitchen's ordering policy was &quot;Don't even think about ordering more until we've completely run out.&quot; Not good when people are paying for the service.All in, if I had been charged 35.75 for a room INCLUSIVE of breakfast, I would have said that it was excelent value; however, having paid seperately for the breakfast, I have to say that it wasn't worth the 6.75 they charged."
41,1301,"Jan 8 2008 	Excellent value and great location for the O2 arena	I have just returned from a one night stay at the Travelodge, and I agree with many of the comments already on here.It was a bargain at 29 for the night, and only 5 for parking! There was loads of room in the car park too when we arrived at about 1.30pm (on a Sunday) so no issue with spaces either.I stayed with 2 friends, and there was plenty of space in the room to move about, and I slept comfortably on the sofa bed with a lovely soft duvet that I wanted to take home with me! There's a nice flat screen TV in the room as well as coffee &amp; tea facitlites.Considering we were right at the front of the hotel, literally in touching distance of the airport, we weren't kept awake by any noise. Staff were friendly and pleasant.We were attending a concert at the o2 arena nearby, and walked down the road to the London City airport station. Had I read other reviews before we went, I now know there is also a bus that stops right outside the hotel which links to the nearby Canning Town station. We travelled into Central London in less than half an hour. We walked back from the airport station to the hotel around midnight, and despite being 3 girls, we were quite happy and there was no cause for concern. All in all, it was a great value stay, worthy of all the good reviews they have on here. Ok, it's not The Soho Hotel (no.1 rated London hotel on Trip Advisor) but it's better than I expected for a 29-a-night Travelodge and I would happily stay there again."
42,1301,Jan 8 2008	Great Value for Money / Great Location	HiStayed here for a concert at the 02 - found the hotel easy to drive to - plenty of parking and the DLR train station only 10 min walk away and got to london within about 20 mins on a all day rail card which only cost about a fiver.Food very nice - staff really helpful.Great bargain break - will definately go again!
43,1301,"Nov 15 2007	Recent Visit	I thought after using the trip advisor website many times I should contribute back.This hotel is exactly what you would expect from Travel Lodge - it's clean, well maintained and if you use your head you get a fantastic deal.Everyone else has sung it's praises so there's no point in repeating it all again other than to say we have just got home and I've just booked a week there for next summer at 29 a night.One major piece of information to note regarding the travel to and from the hotel.If you go to London City Airport you have to walk back along a fairly desolate road which takes about 15 minutes and I wouldn't fancy at night to be honest.I asked the receptionist at the hotel about alternatives and she game me this gem of a tip.Get the day travel passes for the underground/DLR/bus (on day one go to a station information desk and buy them in advance for the rest of your stay but get the DAILY ones not the 3 or 7 days ones which work out more expensive).Once you have your daily travel cards:every time you go out walk to the car park barrier and there is a bus stop, get on the 474 bus (every 4 minutes) and go to Canning Town which is 5 minutes on the bus.Canning Town is a three-in-one self contained station - tube, DLR and bus.At Canning Town you can access the tube and DLR and the bus when coming back.When coming back get off the DLR or tube at Canning Town and get the same 474 bus which again will go past the entrance to the hotel where there is a bus stop on either side of the road. Get off at the entrance and walk back inside the hotel!!It's so simple and a great service all included in your daily pass at 5.70.Don't go anywhere near the London City Aiport DLR as you'll just have a walk back along to the hotel when you could already be sitting pretty in your room."
44,1301,"Sep 17 2007 	Basic but clean	I booked this Travelodge because of the great reviews I had read here and I wasn't disappointed. I booked way in advance because I already had other plans made and was able to get the 26.00 pounds per night deal. As others have mentioned that is a fantastic rate for London. The room was basic but very clean, beds were confortable and there was enough room for myself and two teens to move around in. The only complaint was &quot;no soap&quot;. I knew we were not going to get the basket of toiletries etc but I did expect a bar of soap. Had to make a trip to a small store not too far from the hotel to find some. The area isn't the best and I would not want to linger around there after dark. There really is nothing around the hotel to make for a pleasant evening stroll etc but for a basic place to stay while commuting in and out of London it was o.k. As mentioned, it's about a ten minute walk to the DLR and trains are frequent, every ten minutes. Did not find the noise of either the Dlr or airport to be a major concern.The breakfast buffet was good, plentiful and well maintained. Expensive if you don't have children but for 7 pounds fifty my two children (15 and under) and myself had a substantial start to the day.All in all a good stay and for the price it can't be beat."
45,1301,"Sep 8 2007 	Excellent Value	Booked approx 6 weeks ago and managed to get a 26 room.We had a bedroom on the third floor with views to the Airport. The double glazing was efficient so the plane noise was not obtrusive.Room simply furnished but more than adequate for a one or two night stay. (even if we had to pay a higher rate ). Plenty of Tea and coffee provided in the room. Pleasant 10 min walk to DLR.Staff were very helpful and happy, my request for an extra pillow was cheerfully met. Would definitely stay again when travelling to O2 for a show."
46,1301,"Aug 31 2007 	Value for money but . . . .	As a business traveller I stay at the Travelodge because it is conveniently located near the terminal at London City Airport. I understand that the accomodations are basic, but appreciate the low price as well.If you have to fly in and out of London (City) and are in need a place to sleep and wash, you can do so here without being being ripped off. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom, with its single bar of soap, was clean. Apart from the room, the rest of the hotel could be kept a bit tidier or at least a bit cheerier. But then again, this place is spartan and functional by design, without any frills or extras. On my last visit, I was witness to a number of low-level spats between the unwashed and the hotel staff -- in both instances centering on the former's perceived limited access to alcohol. And therein lay exposed the great difficulty for Travelodge . On the one hand simple, budget hotels such as this one are an attractive alternative for the business traveller, particularly in London. At the same time, Travelodge's attractive pricing can act as a magnet for the low-rent crowd. Probably not an issue for most male travellers, but perhaps one for women. Bear all this in mind and you'll be better positioned to accept a night or two at the Travelodge."
47,1301,"Aug 23 2007 	Excellent for the O2	We stayed here as an overnight stay for a concert at O2. We had read the previous reviews and decided to make our way down to London early and take advantage of the car park and head into town. Getting a one day Travelcard (which we used to get to the O2 in the evening) made it more worthwhile. We passed on the breakfast at the hotel and went to McDonalds for breakfast after we checked out, which is about 7 minutes drive away towards the North Circular Road. All in all a good night's stay!"
48,1301,"Aug 12 2007 	Good value hotel	We stayed one night at the Travelodge as we were going to the O2 arena for a concert. The journey to the O2 took approx 1/2 hour - 10 mins walk to DLR station then DLR a couple of stops and change for 1 stop on the Jubilee line. Very easy and lots of trains after the concert so didn't take long to get back despite number of passengers. The room was OK - fairly basic, en-suite shower, TV etc. Clean and in good condition as fairly new. No complaints on the room. The hotel itself was quite hot though. It seemed to be down to the lighting in the corridors. Breakfast was good value - 7.50 for hot buffet, cereal, toast, fruit &amp; yoghurt. You can only get to the rooms if you have a key as there is a corridor to the lift which we felt was fairly good security - afetr 10pm they lock the main door so yo have to buzz for security. Car parking costs 5 per night whcih we also thoguht was good value. Overall good experience and would stay again if we were going to O2 again."
49,1301,Jun 27 2007 	Fantastic!	I booked this hotel in advance as part of the travelodge 26 offer. The hotel is quite new so furnishings are in perfect condition. The room was large and very clean - provided all that we needed. Staff were very friendly and the resturant/bar service quick. The food was nothing special but well priced. It was well located for our trip out of city airport and close to a DLR stop. Would definitely recommend!
50,1301,Jun 18 2007 	Another great stay at this hotel	This is my second visit to this hotel - it is marvelous!The staff are very friendly and the rooms absolutely spotless and got all that you want. Breakfast is 7.50 for as much as you can eat cooked and also cereals etc. It is in between Pontoon Dock and London City Airport DLR stops. I found it a better walk for to go to Pontoon Dock. There is also a good bus service from outside the hotel.
51,1301,"Jun 15 2007 	Still as good	We stayed at this place three nights 5-9 June. We got a family room on he first floor and paid 26 punds a night. For the price we paid this is a very good alternative.For that fantastic price we got a clean, quiet and a room large enough for the three of us. As our room was on the DLR side (tube side) we could open the window without the feeling that someone could come through the window. If you get first floor on the parking side (airport side) you will proabybly feel that someone might come and try to enter (they do have safty chains on the windows). We had dinner twice at the hotel. First night very slow service and dirty tables as a lot of people had decided to dine late. Second night much better service with clean tables. Breakfast was good however we had it late and understood that it was very busy early in the morning. But for the price we paid we undertstand that Travelodge can not have to much staff. If you get a travelcard for your London transport take an off peak one allowing you on the system from 0930 then you can have breakfast a bit later and then off you go.The hotel is soundproof and I can honestly say without this the hotel would not have be an alternative for us. The perfect location for London City Airport also means that, if the wind is towards the hotel, you will smell the jetfuel to such an extent that you want to close the window. But the airport closes when you go to sleep so you will be ok if your are out and about during the day.To get to the hotel we took a taxi from London City Airport it costed with a tip 4 punds. If you arrive late with children I would recommend this and avoid geeting lost first night. If you want to walk just follow the DLR track towards the city using the pavement on the road under and beside the DLR track (described before in other reviews).Conclusion, this is a very good alternative in London if you want a fine basic room and want to use your money on other things than a nice view from your window."
52,1301,Jun 11 2007 	Great Location for London days out	Great Location. Rooms are great for the money. Had a family room for 1 night. Parked the car early on the Wednesday and took the bus then tube into London. Took about 30mins in total to get to Westminster. Only cost 5 to park the car which was a great deal. Would definately use this hotel next trip to London.
53,1301,"Jun 1 2007 	Very Good Value	Stayed with the family for 3 days in May 2007, kids are 15,9 and 9 months so needed a cheap and cheerfull hotel with good access to the city.Despite its very close proximity to the airport and the DLR rail link there is very little disruption to sleep from either side. We had a room facing the DLR so that may of helped damp down the airport noise but i dont htink it would have made any difference.The hotel is very clean and the staff more than helpfull. Breakfast is a buffet style, sometimes you have to wait for more food to be sent from the kitchen but most of the time there was planty for everyone for the 7.50pp charge (kids eat free) cant complain.In general i would recomend this travellodge for the price and location especially if you have no kids, it was a bit of a struggle on the DLR with the pram and kids in the late peak rush hour."
54,1301,"May 28 2007 	clean and tidy	This is a good modern travelodge. The rooms were clean and the service at reception was good. Service in the bar area was very slow and the chap in front of me was having problems ordering food as nothing on the menu was in stock, but they were only minor issues.As wilth all hotels, the room, was very warm and if you open the window you hear the DLR or planes taking off till the ealry hours."
55,1301,"Apr 22 2007 	Great Value	Stayed here for two weeks, using it as a base for Kings Cross, simply because it was 26/night. After staying at the Easyhotel, this was pure luxury, with a large room and good TV reception. The rooms are pretty much standard Travelodge fare, but things did seem newer and more spacious. No toiletries except for a small bar of soap, but at the price who cares. It's a fast 10 minute walk to the airport station and you get to Bank in about 25 minutes for onward connections. It takes about 1 hour minimum door-to-door for Kings Cross, but at 26 I can live with that. If you're staying a few days at a good rate the savings quickly mount up."
56,1301,"Apr 16 2007 	Great value modern and stylish	Paid 26 for a room, which was a nice size, modern and comfortable. Area isn't great, at the end of a runway, but sound-proofed so not disturbed. Walking distance from City Airport DLR but easier to go to Canning Town DLR or Jubilee line station and go downstairs to the bus station, go to stand D and take the 474 - it takes 9mins and stops outside the hotel carpark."
57,1301,"Mar 28 2007 	Clean and very good value	We booked a 26 family smoking room (2 adults, 1 child). On top of that add the 5 car parking charge - still very cheap for 24 hours in London - and 15 for 2 adult breakfasts. Kids eat breakfast for free which is very good. So for 46 we got a very clean and tidy room for 3 people, in Docklands, in range of Central London. No complaints at all.Room security was good - you couldn't even get to the lift without card key access. Luckily our room also looked out over where I'd parked. There was no sign of any problems, and no specific warnings were given, but it is a fairly deserted area so thieves could operate relatively easily I'd imagine.Similarly, the DLR is further away than is ideal in such a quiet area (10 mins), and there was no one around there to help or make you feel secure.Having said that, we experienced no problems.Excellent value for money, decent standard of hotel, if (naturally, considering the brand) somewhat lacking in character. Clean and tidy though."
58,1301,"Mar 18 2007	Great value for money	What can you expect for 26 per night?? well the answer is, a big room, comfortable bed, great power shower and a spotlessly clean hotel. I have stayed in a few travelodges in my time, and this has to be one of the better ones. Okay the location isnt great, but when you are only paying 26, what can you expect.Even found the walk from the hotel to the DLR station was not too bad after a while.Would recommend exploring this part of London as there is a lot too see, and if you get a chance, nip off at Pontoon Dock( 1 stopup from City Airport on DLR) and have brekkie in the little restaurant overlooking the Thames Flood Barrier...a little hidden gem. We sat outside in the sun in the middle of march and enjoyed coffee and bacon rolls, it was bliss."
59,1301,"Mar 4 2007	beware of car thieves	basic hotel normal quality of travelodge. we managed to get a room for 15 for one night to see the sights of london. Close to London city airport, 10 minutes walk, taxi refused to take us as said he had been waiting in the queue too long to take us down the road. We were unable to check in as room not ready, we parked in car park, there were cameras and all looked ok. We returned at 9pm and checked in. The receptionist asked me if i had left anything in my car, to which i replied no. She then told me they had 3 cars broken into that night. Very re-assuring when you are about to leave your car whilst you sleep. Awoke the next morning to see 2 further cars in the car park had been broken into. Able to leave car for 5 per day...bargain free car thieves operating. They should improve their security before i would take my car there again. Rooms ok, bar nice, vending machines, 35 mins into central london on dlr and only 6 per day for a off peak ticket incl underground. I did receive an email from travelodge about what i thought about my stay, I informed them of the break ins. They didnt bother to reply..."
60,1301,"Feb 15 2007	Very Good Hotel!	We booked on travelodge website and got 2 rooms for 2 nights at 26 per room per night - which for a double en-suite in London is fantastic. The hotel was very new when we stayed and looks fantastic from outside. The reception worker was slow checking us in but allowed us to check-in at 2:20 - 40 minutes early. The hotel is well located next to London City Airport - good for people who are flying... but for bargain hunters like us it was alright as their is a DLR station there and it shuts at the latest 10pm, and there are no flights until about 8am I'd guess. At the back the DLR passes very near to your window, but you can only hear this when you go to bed - tv off, the hotel is relatively quiet and you just hear a rattle every 5 mins until about 11:30PM.The DLR starts again about 6AM but it didn't wake me up. The keycards took a bit of getting used to, but were good once we had worked them out. The lifts were clean and new. The rooms were in good condition with a great bed and shower and in reasonable condition - they just needed a hoovering. The smoking rooms didn't smell of smoke at all - infact they smelt of lemon which was refreshing. I hope to grab the same deal again and come back this year.The only problems I had was the hotel was quite noisy - we had french people shouting on our floor, the kettles were noisy, and the hotel was quite a long way from central London (and even further from Euston station.) The tube was fine always, but I always found the DLR to take a long time to get to the station we were going to."
61,1301,"Jan 5 2007 	SIMPLY FANTASTIC!	We acctually managed to get the 10 pre booked rate through the website and stayed for a long weekend.The hotel had to be brand new! everything was clean and working (rare for Travelodge!) A large well lit and clean bathroom with oodles of hot water available 24 hours a day!The staff were helpful and friendly, including, as we were using the vending machine in the foyer that we would get everything we wanted far cheaper in the Esso station just behind the HotelFood was good, hot and not overpriced at both breakfast and eveening mealsAlthough opposite the runway of the airport our room was silent with the double glazingDirections given by the hotel misleading though, follow these:Get off Tube/DLR at London City Airport and walk along platform using escalators to exit. at base of escalator take stairs to your left. these will bring you through a subway and out directly opposite Tate &amp; Lyle factory. Follow the footpath to your right for approx 50 yds, then follow snaking path up to road level. Follow road to your left for 100yds to traffic lights. at T junction cross over twice and head to right. at roundabout go left, then hotel is directly on your left"
62,1301,"Dec 28 2006 	Very good value for money	We rarely stay in the same place on our trips to London and this was yet another new one. We booked far enough in advance to get the 15 per room per night offer and although arriving at midday we managed to check in early before our visit to the fire brigade museum. The room was spacious, clean and quiet despite all the comings and goings due to the fog at the airport. Toiletries were thin on the ground but at that price and as Travelodge rightly say (on the card in the room) most people bring their own shampoo etc. anyway. A request for an extra pillow was quckly seen to. Car parking is 5 per day but don't lose your ticket as it will cost 150 to get out!!!It's a 5 minute walk to the DLR at London City Airport where there's a train every 10 minutes to Bank Station, a journey of about 25 minutes. I realise for some people an hours journey to the West End maybe far too long but at 15 per night plus 5.40 for an offpeak Zones 1-4 Rail Card it's hard to beat."
63,1301,"Nov 9 2006	Excellent value!	We stayed for 4 nights in August,booking 2 family rooms at only 26 per room,per night.The hotel was clean &amp; modern,likewise the rooms.The &quot;all you can eat&quot; breakfast was good vaue as was the evening meal in the hotel bar/restaurant.All the staff were helpful &amp; friendly,particularly the guy supervising breakfast. Although the hotel is in the middle of a wasteland,we enjoyed the Thames Barrier Park,only a short walk away.Similarly,we got used to the boring 10 minute walk to the Docklands Light Railway station at London City Airport(another good place for a snack)though the DLR.itself was a real bonus:-clean,regular &amp; reliable trains,only 10mins to Canary Wharf &amp; an interesting 25min journey into central London.I agree that the hotel needs air conditioning,but in a nutshell,would I stay there again?.....yes please!"

1,1306,Nov 21 2009 	Perfectly comfortable safe nights sleep	Does what it says on the tin.Higher quality than other travelodges.Clean and well maintained
2,1306,"Nov 19 2009 	great hotel in perfect location	This is only 8 minutes from Fulham Broadway Tube station in a lovely and safe area. We arrived late at 11 pm -- buzzed to get in and got a family room with a double bed and a pull out bed. All spotless but beware there are no soaps and shampoo!!. You can buy them in the reception in a machine which we did. Slept well and had a lovely bath in the morning all ready for a day at the Good Food Show. We got a daily pass on the Tube for 5.50. We went to Le Pain Quotidien in Parsons Green for breakfast which was a real treat. Expensive but excellent in a lovely part of London and only a stop on the Tube. All in all, the Travelodge exceeded our expectations at 67 euro per night . !!"
3,1306,"Nov 17 2009 	Don't bother staying here if you want to explore London without your luggage!!!	This hotel is clean and in a reasonable location, about 5 minutes walk from Fulham Broadway underground station.HOWEVER we turned up early in order to go off and look around the city centre and we were told there was nowhere to leave our luggage!!!! I have never, ever come across this in all the hotels I have ever stayed in, be them 5-Star or small family run ones. We had to pay an extra 10 upon check-in to get our room early as this was the only way we could leave our luggage. Disgraceful.The same obviously applied for departure, but in this instance you can only keep the room until 2pm for another charge of 10, so we ended up having to drag our cases around London with us. As you can appreciate, this did not make for a nice day sightseeing and shopping!On the plus side the rooms are perfectly adequate and clean, but we had another problem with our shower starting to drizzle in the early hours, despite being fully turned off. This led to a flood in the bathroom which I discovered when I stepped into it in the dark - great.All I would say is this hotel is fine if you are on business and are literally turning up after work and leaving first thing in the morning, but if you want to go sightseeing and leave your luggage, forget it!!!"
4,1306,"Nov 16 2009 	ok new build Travelodge although avoid rooms located near reception	Brand new Travelodge, its not been open more than 6 months, which means that things are still fresh. Located on North End road in between Fulham Broadway and West Brompton stops (both are about 5 mins away) although Fulham Broadway is slightly closer.Room is standard new build travelodge, abeit with no air conditioning, and a larger LG screen TVMinus point is lack of air conditioning. (not required when we stayed as it was cold outside)Plus point lots of shops, restuarants and fast food places in the vecinity plus good access for the tube and night buses. Room was quite large too!Reasonbly quiet in the area at night, Although avoid any rooms by reception becuase of the ubiquitous travelodge slamming doors.Also free wi-fi from the Mcdonalds across from the hotel. The signal is strong enough to pick up in the rooms.Good, but like all new build travelodges will be interesting to see what this looks like given 6-12 months use."
5,1306,"Nov 13 2009 	A good bed for the night in a great location.	The hotel is a basic but reasonably comfortable place to stay, as are most Travelodges. The location was wonderful. It's a short walk from Fulham Broadway tube station and you have plenty of bars, restaurants and high street retail outlets nearby, which more than makes up for the fact that there is no bar or restaurant in the hotel itself. Other Travelodges are in relatively remote locations, so it was nice to stay in the heart of such a thriving community.The rooms were clean and the staff were helpful. I was disappointed that we only had a shower and not a bath, but other rooms might be different. The bottle opener on the desk was very useful, however! The best thing was the view. We were on the third floor, which gave us a wonderful view of Stamford Bridge football ground, which is nearby, and also a lovely view of the London Eye, the Post Office tower and the Houses of Parliament in the distance.All in all, we had a very enjoyable stay and I would certainly recommend this hotel to a friend."
6,1306,"Oct 22 2009 	Super cheap and super good	I booked this hotel when I was still under construction. I was lucky to find a super rate of 19 pounds per night (breakfast not included, but plenty of places nearby for that). This is the cheapest hotel night I've ever paid but it was very good too! The hotel, as I said, it's new, so everything was pristine. Very clean as well! I got a family room but we were 2 in the end. It was super big and the sofa that can hold 2 as it has a bed below too. The bed was a double one and very comfy. Also in the room: coffee making facilities and TV. And a curious bottle opener attached to the desk!You don't get toileteries included, but I always travel with mine, so don't really need them. Probably the only bad thing for a longer stay is that there's no wardrobe, just a rail with hangers. But still not that much important if you get a nice hotel with a super cheap rate. Great if you are going to Hammersmith or Fulham. I was going to the Apollo for a concert and it was the best option really! The Fulham Broadway tube stop is very very close. Looks further away in the maps, it's 5 minutes, less than 10 for sure. Plenty of shops around the station and also near the hotel. Also cafes (I had breakfast at a Costa one) and restos (from MacDonalds to nicer ones). Very safe area as well.So, if you expect a Hilton or a Marriott, this is not for you. But if you want a basic and clean hotel room for a great price, then book!"
7,1306,"Sep 29 2009 	Pretty characterless but handy for transport and shops	This Travelodge is located on North End Road at Fulham Broadway (about 5 mins walk from the underground of the same name). The hotel is new so the rooms are clean and modern. They are functional rather than luxurious.The hotel is above an Iceland frreezer shop. There is no bar or restaurant on the premises, but this is no big deal because there are plenty of places to eat and drink, from McDonalds about 10 yards away to more upmarket establishments in the immediate area.The shopping centre at Fulham Broadway underground station has shops and a cinema, so you don't have to drag yourself to the centre of London to shop or watch a film."
8,1306,"Sep 1 2009 	clean and comfortable	we went for a weekend away and although not in the thick of it or in the centre of London it was only a short tube ride away from the nearby station at fulham broadway so easily accessible and alot cheaper than nearby hotels.our room was clean and tidy although on the smallish side it was more than adequate for us as we were out all day so only needed the room to sleep in.the street noise could be noisy sometimes sirens and that but the window once shut kept most noises out,but as far as the minus points all i could say is for a new hotel the window fittings wasn't very good as the handle to open and shut it was very lose and felt like could fall off any minute.would definitely stay there again tho.food wise round near hotel is good super markets etc all around"
9,1306,"Aug 17 2009 	One of the best Travelodges	Just returned from a 2 night stay at Fulham Travelodge having visited London to see U2 at Wembley Stadium.Check in very straight forward - friendly and informative young man on reception, brought an extra towel to room within a minute of request.Room basic but extremely clean and functional for weekend stay in London. Slept well - no noise at night and shower was very good. Booked room in advance and got a great rate (30 per night).Only short walk from Fulham Broadway tube station and plenty of restaurants, pubs and shops nearby."
10,1306,"Aug 7 2009 	week end in london	Easy to find from underground, Very nice service but the room was basic, tv, tea &amp; coffee and not much room to put clothes out, lived out of suitcase for 2 days as hubby used what hangering space they had! It is very easy to get to central London. Fulham high street was friendly and the pub on the corner was really nice. shops and food close as hotel on high street.Went to see Jersey boys fantastic play, music great."
11,1306,"Aug 2 2009 	Great! Nice stay	We had a room to the side of the hotel so it was really quiet and we slept really well. The room was very clean. We had to move the bed as I'd dropped an earing and it was spotless underneath! North End rd is not the smartest of areas but real london! Busses 28, 31 stop by the hotel and its a short walk from fulham broadway.we found the staff really friendly. will definatly go there again.Good veggi restaurant at 222 North end rd."
12,1306,"Aug 2 2009 	Overall a good stay	We had a family room which was very large by London standards. The whole hotel is clean and new and was a bargain for the cheap rate we were able to get. The neighbourhood has everything you'd need including a few shady characters. Close to several supermarkets and food outlets. On the downside it is about a 10 minute walk from Fulham Broadway tube, the windows don't open more than a few inches and there are no fans or airconditioning which makes for a very hot and noisy sleep during the summer. Overall I would definitely go back but probably better in winter."
13,1306,"Jul 23 2009 	Very good Travelodge!	Stayed here 1 night in July 2009 to attend an event at Earls Court.Travelodges can be very hit or miss but I found this one to be a hit. Everything was spotlessly clean and the lady at reception was very polite and welcoming.Yes there is a bit of pub noise during the night as this Travelodge is located on a busy street but thier website does inform you of this before you book. Plus, it's common sense that a hotel on a street full of pubs will have noise so there's no point in compaining.If you need a quick brekkie then McDonalds is 1 door away and there are numerous grocery shops if you need some food or other items.Earls Court and West Brompton tube stations are just a few minutes walk away."
14,1306,"Jul 13 2009 	Basic hotel but clean and new	We arrived early (around noon) and had to pay 10 to check in early, as normal check in time is 3pm. The hotel is located on the North End Road close to Fulham Broadway underground station. The hotel doesn't have a breakfast option, but there are plenty of cafs in the area. The hotel is right next to a pub and McDonald's. KFC is also close to the hotel. Fulham Broadway underground is about 5 minutes walk away. Whilst West Brompton tube were about 7 min walk from the hotel. The rooms were clean, although the towels were a bit stained. We also had to ask for more towels in the reception three nights in a row, as we only got one set of towels after service. Rooms are also equipped with a small sized flat screen tv and a desk. Bathroom was small but the shower was really good. Hairdryer can be borrowed from the reception. The windows can't be opened more than a few inches, but not a big problem really. There are a bit of noise from the street, so light sleepers could have some issue with this. All in all a good experience, and this hotel is excellent if you want to stay close to Stamford Bridge / Chelsea FC on matchdays."
15,1306,"Jul 13 2009 	Nice Travelodge	Stayed for two days in Fulhams new Travelodge in July 2009 and found it to be typical travelodge basic but clean and cheap.Rooms have TV,shower &amp; tea/coffee making facilities but little room to put your clothes but they are quiet and dark giving you a chance of a good nights sleep.There are vending machines in reception for cold drinks &amp; snacks as well as shampoo,toothpaste and anything else that you may have forgotten.The location is good as it is situated around lots of shops,pubs and places to eat and a short walk to the underground station (District line)."
16,1306,"Jul 2 2009 	Awful for a brand new hotel.	I was very disappointed with this hotel. I thought that it being a brand new TravelLodge it would of been perfect. However it was not the case. We stayed for 3 nights and did not get a decent night's sleep at all. The rooms were like an oven with no air conditioning and the window only opened less than 3 inches.The girls on reception are very poor, not very welcoming and was going to charge us 10 for being half an hour early, as you can only check in at 3.When we came to checkout we told her about our experience and she said &quot;yeah everyone complains&quot; and that they have only 8 portable fans..I will never stay in a TravelLodge again, no matter of the price. My advice is to stay away from this hotel and to spend a little bit more."
17,1306,"Jun 19 2009 	Great find if you need to be in the West London area	We found a great deal for this new Travelodge via the TL homepage. Since the Hotel had been marked as new and we did not find any reviews in Tripadvisor we decided to &quot;risk&quot; it.We have not been disappointed. The Hotel is in North End Road and it is housed in a newly build extension to an existing property (from what i can tell). Next door to McDonalds and Iceland. North End Road has a busy market on weekdays. Tube station is Fulham Broadway. About 10 Min walk. (2nd choice West Kensington about 10-15min). The Hotel does not offer proper Breakfast but there are plenty of eateries in the area. As any TL property the rooms and facilities are basic. Flat screen TV, Coffeemaker, Shower in the bath. Rooms are clean and still have the new feel (and smell) to them. Beds where comfortable. Be aware that you can not deposit your luggage in the Hotel."

Tried to chek in at 1pm to be told check in is 3pm and there is nowhere to store your baggage unless you pay 10 early check in charge which i paid as had no alternative. On our return to our room at midnight after seeing a show we were settling down to sleep to find a Mouse on the edge of the sofa bed. We were eventually moved rooms and did have some money refunded the next morning. The hotel is disgusting, please everyone avoid at all costs ! We were told by the manager the mice are an ongoing problem due to building work and pest control have attended and thought the problem was sorted. Obviously not !"
2,1310,"Nov 23 2009	Try somewhere else	I booked this hotel for a large group for a weekend, We arrived to find out that they wouldn't store our luggage, after about 10 minutes of trying to get some help from them, they told us that we should take our bags to the Station (8 per bag) - we had to do this! More examples......*) In the family rooms they didn't give enough breakfast vouchers and it took a request to speak to the manager to finally get the correct amount.*) In the evening after watching a show I wasn't able to get into my room as the keys didn't work and I didn't have any ID on me.*) Not enough towels in the rooms etc etc etcRooms were ok, the bathrooms were dampThe floors were being washed with the dirtest bucket of water i've seen in a while.It may have been cheap but you can get the Premier Inn etc for the same kind of price and thats where we shall be staying for next years stay"
3,1310,"Nov 21 2009 	Don't let a good location fool you in to thinking this is a good hotel!	woken at 3am management did nothing to stop a crowd of people screaming and drinking in the hall.Accidently pulled the disabled emergency cord in the room adn it took 20 mins for anyone to turn up, lucky it was an accident and not for real!Business friendly hotel with no Iron to loan out, get real!Very strange and disturbing smell in all hallways.Poor breakfast.Shocking for 100+"
4,1310,"Nov 17 2009 	Lift STILL out of action more than a year on!	A pretty typical Travelodge, worth booking if you can get a very cheap deal, but certainly not worth the full rate.For anyone who's been following the broken lift saga, you might want to know that it was out of action yet again for the whole of last weekend - with a notice put up (see photo) apologising, but pointing out that there's been a warning on the website for more than a year. Does it really take that long to fix a lift? No joke if you're having to walk up 6 floors.There's noise from the trains, as others have pointed out, and there's a warning on the website about noise from the building site next door. The room wasn't filthy, but could certainly have been cleaner - I can just about live with someone else's toe nail, but nasal secretions on two of the walls really should have been dealt with!The LCD television works fine, though it's difficult to see why Freeview channels aren't provided - they are free, after all. And why no Radio 4?The bathroom was fine, if a little damaged and mildewy. The fixed shower head is hopeless, though, particularly for women and people with children.As always, the window won't open beyond a few centimetres, and it would make the room unbearably hot in the summer, or even the spring and autumn. I know it's supposed to be a health and safety issue, but how would anyone get out in the event of a fire?In summary, it's a Travelodge. Good value if you can book a cheap room in advance, but you have to be prepared to accept the limitations. I think the non-opening windows are a serious risk to life, though."
5,1310,"Oct 27 2009 	Another Good Stay	This is my second review for this Travelodge. I booked this room for 19 when they had the sale on in April. This time i took the family so had the family room. Check in was a breeze, the room and sheets were clean. We had a first floor room so can't comment on the lift as we used the stairs. If i had to be negative there were 3 cups in the room for 4 of us, we only had one pillow each and the stairwell smelled as if someone had thrown up in it recently (can't blame them for their guests antics ). Didn't use the cafe on site as we walked to mcdonalds for breakfast at Liv st station (5 mins away). I'd go back again for the right price as it meets all your basic needs."
6,1310,"Oct 15 2009 	Reasonable budget hotel in good location	You will be pleased to know that the lift has now been fixed! Not bad for a budget hotel in London. Reasonably priced for London at 85 (92 euros, $137 US) for a double room. There was a mild damp smell, but not too all-pervading and the staff seemed to occasionally spray fragrance to get rid of it. The receptionist was friendly and efficient and the room was clean. I was in room 615 on a Thursday night in October 2009. There was no telephone in the room, but there was an electric kettle, coffee, tea, milk (Milk Maid tastes like fresh milk). The bathroom had a shower (no bath), no plug in the sink, and a small bar of soap was provided. The television had the 4 main terrestrial channels, BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel 4, but no Channel 5. Close to local food shops, cafes, pubs and bars."
7,1310,Oct 10 2009 	40 - Great Value and location	I spent 1 night at this travelodge. All the usual stuff. Very good on reception. Chose a family room which was hugeGreat location for city sightseeing or business very close to Liverpool Street. Plenty of shops and eateries close byQuiet and comfyDef stay again for an overnight Make sure you take all of your own toiletries
8,1310,"Oct 7 2009 	Grand spot - hotel little run down though	This is very central hotel, very near liverpool street station. Little hard to find and next to some social housing area. The hotel is relatively new but does not appear to have been kept in great condition. Lift was broken and odd smells around. The rooms are very very basic and do the job ok. They are clean but show signs of age and wear. Generally not much specifically wrong but could be better."
9,1310,"Oct 7 2009 	Cheap But You Get What you Pay For Here!	I have stayed at Travelodges before so I knew what to expect, but this didn't even meet any of them. Arrived earlier than the 3:00pm check-in so wasn't expecting to have a room but was told we couldn't leave our luggage any where unless we paid 10 for early check-in, which we had to do as we weren't likely to return until late at night. When we got to the room it was very bare with no pictures on the walls, the carpets were dirty and the room had a musty smell. The bathroom was no better, the shower was dirty and I didn't need one of those ultra-violet lights to see the dirt on the toilet seat and bowl, as you could see the streaks all over it. We wont be staying here here again!"
10,1310,Oct 1 2009 	Cheap nice location	It was Cheap and in a good location although the hotel itself smelt quite stale. like it hadnt been cleaned in a while or it was cleaned with dirty equiptment.
11,1310,"Sep 29 2009 	Excellent Value!	I have just returned from a 2 night stay in Travelodge Liverpool Street in London. After reading some of the reviews on here, I was a bit nervous about my stay. How wrong I was. From the minute we arrived to the time we left, we had a very enjoyable stay.The staff were great, not intrusive, but helpful when you needed them. Check in took less than 2 minutes, and of course the lift was out of order and we got a room on the top floor! But, the advantage of this is it put me off going for a cigarette once i went to my room!The room was very clean, as was the bathroom. There was a flatscreen t.v , with decent channels too! The bed was very comfortable and although the room got a bit warm at night, you just kck off the duvet and hey presto! you cool down! I think that this is a simple hotel for people looking for a cheap comfortable stay in London. It's pretty central, less than a 10 minute walk to London Bridge, and Liverpool Street Station is a 2 minute walk and you can get anywhere from there!Don't let the cheap price put you off!! This is a great hotel!!"
12,1310,"Sep 18 2009 	ONLY AS A LAST RESORT!	We are used to Travelodge and usually know what to expect - basic but clean, with pleasant staff. Hmm....this Travelodge did not live up to expectations. It was very smelly (damp, dirt, cigarettes), it was quite run down and the staff not very bothered. On our arrival the lift was broken so we were moved to a room on a lower floor which was nice but on heading up the stairs were greeted with dirty linen being thrown down the stairwell be cleaning staff!!! Anyway, the room was ok. Again, quite run down. The area is a bit scary. I wouldn't have wanted to be out alone. It was probably only just worth the 19 we paid for the one night and I would only go back if there was no-where else to stay in London!"
13,1310,"Sep 15 2009 	Not as good as some other London Travelodges	I've stayed in a few London Travelodges - Covent Garden, Marylebone and two near Kings Cross - and this is the one I'm least likely to return to. It's easy enough to get to, but situated in dark, quiet streets just off Petticoat Lane - not the best area to wander around at night. The corridor smelt strongly of damp, there was litter in the lift in the morning, the room was a bit worn looking in places and the bathroom smelt of cigarette smoke. Not all of that is the hotel's fault though, and we only paid 19 for a surprisingly quiet double room which was terrific value."
14,1310,"Sep 10 2009 	Very disappointing!	Have used Travelodge a lot in recent years because you know what to expect - nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable. However, this one failed to live up to expectations. As other reviewers have said, the lift was out of order (and we were on the 5th floor); My husband and I had to share a towel the first night as there had been a problem with the delivery - new towels didn't arrive until the next day; Room very hot - so we had to leave the window open - which meant that we were woken at 5am both mornings by lorries outside the window and the sound of trolleys being loaded/unloaded. I don't think this was from the building works - but maybe it was the towels being delivered! We paid extra for breakfast and evening meal. Whilst there was a good selection (and quantity) of food for breakfast, the 'hot' food was left standing under heat lamps and was lukewarm at best. However, the main problem was with the evening meal. The first evening there was no one around to take our order. My husband went down to reception and eventually someone came up to take the order. We couldn't have what we wanted because the fryer was broken - so we opted for Steak &amp; Ale Pie. Fine - except there were no peas and no alternative veg - so we just had pie &amp; mash. I ordered Banoffee pie for pudding. When it arrived it was frozen solid. I took it back to the kitchen and complained (nicely|) that it had not been defrosted. I was told it was meant to be like that and that was how they were trained to serve it.. and they offered me a knife to cut it with!! The second night the menu was reduced even further to either pizza or curry! I wouldn't have bothered booking the meals had I known - they definitely were not value for money. The final straw was cold water on the last morning of our stay because the boiler had broken.Whilst you could say that the hotel staff can't help it if things break down -and if it was only one thing at a time it would be bearable - it didn't appear that a great deal of effort was going into resolving the issues. As someone else said, maintenance doesn't seem to be high on the list of priorities."
15,1310,"Sep 1 2009 	You get what you pay for!	When I arrived the first day there was a notice up saying the lift was broken. I didnt mind, I was aware from other reviews that it never worked!Woke up second day to see a notice saying that due to an accident there was a shortage of linen and towels for that day, but more would arrive later - and they did.Third day, yet another notice, this time saying that the hot water was broken and would be fixed shortly, if not we would be moved to another hotel - Thankfully it was fixed!Also, when we decided to try the restaurant, they had no food, except for curries!And the rooms were roasting, the window was kept open all week and the quilt was abandoned, using just a sheet instead!But these things didnt bother me or spoil the trip.. I just thought they were hilarrious!The staff were friendly, rooms were clean and food was good. Also, its really close to Liverpool St Station!And that's what matters... Right?"
16,1310,"Aug 25 2009 	An Underated Location; usual Travelodge (sub) standards	Right - I dislike Travelodge as some of you may know but I really couldn't complain about this one for 29 for the night (Sunday). I chose it because it is only a 20 minute night bus from Vauxhall (I was going clubbing) and it is dead close to Liverpool Street Station - on the Central line and just a couple of stops on the West End. It is literally a two minutes walk away from the station in a quiet street.It is also close to the gateway to the East End - Shoreditch, Brick Lane, Hoxton. Shabby chic personified just a stroll away.The hotel is as unpredictable as all the other Travelodges I've been to. The lift was out of order and there were several panes of smashed glass in public areas. In my rooom there was a huge dent where door had slammed open and there was a bedside cabinet missing with only the drill holes to show for it. None of this really bothered me but I'd expect more if I had paid more. That said the room was clean and quiet and had a flat screen telly and there was an occasional mechanical chugging noise but then I always carry ear plugs with me....as some of you may know already ;-)"
17,1310,"Aug 25 2009 	Would not stay again...	This travelodge is in a great location for tube stations and walking distance to most places...but it is situated down a dodgy looking lane from Bishopsgate, it seemed harmless enough after a few days of knowing where we were.The actual hotel itself was a disgrace though. We arrived at 2 am to no one on the reception desk (there never was anyone there unless you pressed the bell, and on one occasion the reception girl was very annoyed that we uncovered the bell, which she'd hid with a sign!) Anyway, we were told that we were on the 5th floor and that the lift was out of order, we asked for another room on a lower floor because I have asthma and was told no. After climbing the stairway, which was smelly and damp with cracked windows, all we wanted to do was sleep. Which we couldn't do because the building had no air conditioning at all and it was boiling. At 7:45 am we were awaken to the sound of the building works right outside our window, which no one had mentioned. This went on for the four days we were there. I tried to close the window for some peace and quiet to get my head together, but there was no handle on the window. When we woke up properly and had a good look around I was horrified. There were stains on the carpet (do not walk in bare feet!) spilt coffee or whatever on the walls, cigarette butts in the window frame, our quilt cover was torn, the lamps on either side of the bed were stained and thick with dust, one of the coffee cups was cracked, the bathroom tap was loose and dirty and every time the toilet was flushed upstairs there was a fowl smell coming from our toilet. There is no hair dryer or iron in any of the rooms, but if you ask for them at reception you will get one IF they are available and you have to give it back straight away due to the small amount they have. So to have a shower and dry my hair I had to run down five flights of stairs and back, get ready then run down five flights of stairs again. I complained about the lift and asked when the engineer would be out to fix it, I was told &quot;it doesn't look likely it'll be any time soon&quot;. On our third day there we came back to our room and no one had been in to empty the bins or give us fresh towels, although we had passed the cleaners earlier that day, who had left piles of dirty laundry lying on the corridor floor. I wasn't running down the stairs to complain, I just wanted to sleep. Not that the reception staff would have helped, they were the most unfriendly people I have ever met. When we were checking out the man on the desk was dealing with someone else and asked if we were checking out, I said yes to which he replied &quot;just leave your key there then&quot; and continued with his conversation. No goodbye or thank you. I know Travelodge is a budget hotel and you pay for what you get, but all I was expecting was a clean and working room and to be treated well. It doesn't cost much for cleanliness and to teach their staff about customer service.I have since emailed Travelodge to complain and explained everything that happened. Their response was that they have sent my complaint to the hotels manager and that he/she will be in touch personally. Will wait and see if I hear anything at all."
18,1310,"Aug 24 2009 	good value for money	Yes this little travelodge is not luxious but what do you expect for the money, however it was very clean and tidy. the staff were very helpful and polite.The breakfast was excellent value..the teenagers paid several visits to the breakfast bar!! It is in a good location foe visiting the city with excellent amnetites nearby..including a post office as part of the building, lots of bars nearby and backs onto Petticoat Lane and 10 minutes walk (if that ) from Old Spitalfields market. Yes there was a little noise from the tube station at Aldgate but you only heard this late at night because everywhere else was so quiet. This is a good base for the city and yes we would stop again."
19,1310,"Aug 14 2009 	A very noisy hotel	We went there to celebrate my daughters birthday, and although the travelodge was very close to the tube station and a tesco, it was very shabby and noisy. Our two rooms backed onto the stairs, and all night we could hear people going up and down the stairs. The rooms were also very hot, and there was very few fans. The windows would only open about 6 inches too. In the morning we were woken up early to hear the sound of lorries and gates. Also the lock on our bathroom door would not lock, and the lift didn't work as well. The hotel was amazing for getting around, but it was just not up to scratch."
20,1310,"Aug 11 2009 	Great location and great value	Stayed at the end of July 2009 for 4 nights in a family room on the 6th floor. The room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was also clean and adequate for our needs. There was building work going on in the surrounding area (which obviously the Travelodge does not have any control over). This started very early in the morning, but did not impact too much on our stay. All the staff were most courteous and we were able to check in promptly at 3pm. Great value for the 19 per night - could not have asked for better value.The hotel is in a great position close to Liverpool St station, but situated off a quiet square. We went to a couple of shows and came back late at night, but there was no problem as the businesses surrounding the hotel had nightwatchmen, so we did not feel vulnerable walking in the dark. There are plenty of food outlets a short (approx 3-5 mins) walk away and a Tesco metro opposite the station. We bought cereal and milk from here to eat in the room for breakfast. I can also recommend the Slug and Lettuce (virtually opposite) for a meal (50% off all food on a Monday night). All in all a good travelodge if you want to be close to all the London sights and very handy for the underground."
21,1310,"Aug 11 2009 	Shabby room high noise levels and lift out of order	Have stayed in Travelodge hotels previously and they have always been clean and tidy and this one although quite clean was very shabby, dirty carpet, pictures missing from wall and missing plaster from wall. It seems maintenance is not a priority in this hotel. There were very high noise levels throughout the night, people coming and going, chains and gates rattling from neighbouring buildings and the underground could be heard and felt even though we were on the top floor. For the 3 days we stayed here the lift was out of order, we did not return much as we had 6 flights of stairs to contend with and couldn't be moved as we had a family room of which there were only 2 available both on the top floor. The only benefit was the location of the hotel which was very close to both Liverpool Street and Aldgate tube stations."
22,1310,"Aug 6 2009 	Average	It took us forever to get checked in for reasons they didn't give us.The hotel is a good location for the underground, if your wanted to get out and about BUT the down side to it is you can hear the underground through the night which kept me up."
23,1310,"Jul 21 2009 	Excellent value hotel	We stayed here for 3 nights in march this year and it was perfect for our needs, clean decent sized room's, friendly staff and only 5 min's away from Liverpool street station for your sightseeing trip's.Overall great value hotel in a decent location."
24,1310,"Jul 11 2009 	Excellant Value and Stay Once Again	Another stay at the Travelodge Liverpool Street. What can I say. Super value, I paid 9 a night for four nights (currently on my 2nd night) and booked an early check in. Got to hotel at Noon, checked in with a very pleasant receptionist and given a nice room on the 5th floor..Very clean and tidy as have all my experiences over the years been at this hotel. Staff friendly and polite at all times. I cant understand why people moan so much about the showers: if you adjust the head the bathroom does not get flooded out...just be sensible. Always plenty of hot water; unlimited tea and coffee if you ask for more at reception. Same with towels; always at least two in the room (plus one spare on shelf in room), howmany does one need?? Whenever I stay in London, usually every 2 months I always stay here if I can get in, the location for both tubes, mainline rail and bus routes is excellant, central but just off the main strip in the city so you generally get a good nights sleep. The hotel cannot be held responsible for the odd drunk in the street..that the same anywhere. If the hotel had air con like the newer lodges in town it would be 100% but you have to remember this is the first and original TL in London, still superb value in my mind, the staff are always very helpful...I always find its the way you speak to people, just remember everyone is human and they all work on the minimum wage..just remember that fact!"
25,1310,"Jul 9 2009 	Purpose built perhaps not the best though.	To start, it was a bit out of the way from the station, not ideal for people on their own arriving late in the evening.On seeing that this hotel was purpose built, I expected it to be a similar quality of the Euston Travelodge, however I was wrong, it wasn't great and was very plain and boring. No art work on any of the walls, very narrow staircases and just simply cold and boring.The room was quite small, more spacious than the Euston one, but not as nice, would have preferred the Euston size for the quality. We saw the bathroom, and I was quite excited that there was a bath, however, it wasn't a bath, it was a 1/2 size bath. I'll draw you an image, me in the bath, torso in the bath, legs up the wall. Not comfortable!!!The service was typical of any Travelodge, so acceptable.. The views were not exciting and the window had a fixed curtain... Overall I found it to be acceptable, but wouldn't stay again. On the plus side the station was quite close, I ran and got a mcdonalds and brought it back for breakfast to eat in the room, it was considerably cheaper than the bowl of cereal they offered in the restaurant!"
26,1310,"Jul 6 2009 	Decent hotel for the price	We stayed at the Travelodge Liverpool Street for 5 nights and overall, found the hotel to be decent. The room was clean, the bed fairly comfortable and it is in a great location to catch the tube. There are several pubs, grocery stores as well as Spittalfield's and Petticoat Market all within walking distance.The staff in general were polite and helpful but 2 we encountered were neither. The shower leaked as there was only a shower curtain to hold in the spray and the shower stall is small and the shower head couldn't be adjusted. The in room wi-fi is a bit pricey (as you can see on their website) but they do have computers in the lobby where you can send off a quick email at 1 pound for 20 mins (apparently this was a special price and it's usually 1 pound for 10 mins). My only real complaint is their booking system which wouldn't allow me to book all nights together and still get their super-saver rate, so I booked our first 3 nights separately and we had to get our key re-programmed every morning. The area was pretty quiet on evenings and weekends but we did get woken up as some guests made their way home around 3 am a few nights."
27,1310,"Jul 6 2009 	Horrendous ! the hotel was hot smelly 	I booked to stay here with a friend as somewhere to use after going to a concert at Wembley. We paid an extra 10 to check into our room 2 hours early (1pm) our room was located on the 4th floor, we look the lift only to discover the button for the 4th floor didn't work so you had to get off at the 5th floor and walk down. When we arrived on the 4th floor the corridor was full of dirty laundry as the cleaners had left piles of dirty bedlinen and towels outside all the rooms!! this is not something you expect to see at 1pm in the afternoon, the smell was horrendous, also the corridor was really hot as the air con wasn't working. The carpets in the corridors are old and tatty and all the walls are marked from peoples bags, it just looked old and tired. When we arrived at our room it was basic which is what you expect for a Travelodge. My friend inspected the bed and when she pulled back the quilt we could see there was no mattress protector on the bed and stains on the mattress, we pulled the bottom sheet off for a closer inspection only to find the mattress was badly stained with the stain going through to the otherside and on the bedframe ! My friend went back to reception to complain. A member of staff came to inspect the bed and finally agreed to move us. Our next room again was on the 4th floor. This time the room was slightly cooler and thankfully the mattress has a mattress protector on, at this point we decided not to look under the mattress protector!! however we notice that the bottom sheet had a nice big hole in it, thankfully this was located on the side of the mattress rather where we would sleep. In the bathroom we discovered we'd only been given one bath towel and one hand towel between the two of us and the shower cubicle was full of mould. We left our room to head off to Wembley, we called the lift to take us to the ground floor. After returning from the concert in the early hours of Saturday morning, we had to swip our room card at the reception entrance to allow us back into the hotel. As soon as you walked through the reception doors the heat hit you ! we decided to get a snack from the machine in reception a packet of crisps where 1.60 !! When we finally got back to our room we discover that one of the bedside lamps didn't have a bulb in it. My friend was the first one to use the shower in the morning by the time she'd finished the bathroom floor was soaked, so by the time I'd had my shower the bathroom floor was more like a swimming pool ! it was just horrendous we had to put the hand towel on the floor to stand on to clean our teeth. When we checked out a we were asked to rate our stay between 1 and 10 we gave it minus 20 to which she was very shocked. We asked what we need to do to give an formal complaint, she wasn't very forthcoming and said we would receive an email following our stay where we could write our review, we insisted she took our numbers and that the manager should call us. I'm still waiting for the call.."
28,1310,"Jun 26 2009 	Unplesant!	Stayed one evening, first time in Travelodge. Person on front desk was helpful and welcoming, my room was on the second floor. The corridoor carpet was badly soiled and smelled terribly of dampness - I was later told this is due to the fact the bathrooms flood regularly! Room clean but basic as expected, took a very quick shower and bathroom floor was very wet. After going out to dinner returned to find place totally without electricity, power cuts apparently also regular, asked for emergency light to help find way to room. Lift also out of order obviously. Electricity restored about half an hour later, staff were helpful. Next morning room very hot, still no lift, bathroom flooded once again, went for breakfast which was nice but no air con and unbearably hot. Had to carry bags down stairs, heat unbearable and trouser bottoms soaked after collecting things from bathroom floor still soaked.All in all a very unpleasant stay - only positives, comfortable bed, nice breakfast and lovely staff."
29,1310,"Jun 21 2009 	A brake in London	Picked this hotel as it was central to Liverpool St Station and going on the reviews I got from Trip Adviser, also they were having a sale. I can only say that we enjoyed our stay there. The room was clean the staff were friendly. I will stay there again even having to pay full price."
30,1310,"Jun 19 2009 	Very good value for a short trip	If you want a great location (5 min walk to Liverpool St Station, where you can take trains, tube and buses) and if you don't mind a good &quot;low-cost&quot; hotel, this can be the one.We were aware we had to bring our own shampoo, bath gel and so on; we knew check-in would be only after 3 pm (but, at the reception, we were kindly informed 2.30 was ok enough); we knew also we had to pay a bit more for breakfast, so we knew what to expect.Breakfast was good (7 ou of 10), all you can eat buffet;The only thing we did not like was the fact they only had 1 set of towels for a double room, so we needed to ask for another set. Considereing pros and cons, i think this hotel is a very good value for a short trip to London, if you travel on a budget."
31,1310,"Jun 14 2009 	Fantastic value 	The location of this travelodge is brilliant, short walk from both Aldgate and Liverpool Street underground. Also literally one street away from Petticoat Lane Market. Room was spacious, clean &amp; tidy, bathroom was also nice and clean, girls just remember there are no hairdryers in the rooms! Breakfast was good value too. Considering we got the rooms on one of Travelodge's 19 a night offer we couldnt fault it."
32,1310,"Jun 11 2009 	Good location for underground lousy hotel	I stayed in the Travelodge Liverpool Street for three reasons - price, proximity to the underground, and proximity to a business center where I completed training for three separate days. In respect to all of these aspects, this Travelodge met my needs - it's less than five minutes from Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations by foot. The price was also pretty competitive (I believe we averaged around 100 GBP a night).That being said . . I have some major qualms with staying at this hotel.First of all, I realize you don't go to Central London and expect to pay a small price and get a ton of amenities . . I get that. . however, I think certain things should be expected. For example, they only had one pillow in our room when we got in - and they did not have any more at the front desk, so we had to make due until the second day when more came available. How can a room only have one pillow? I have no idea. . Other things that were problematic and annoying . . no phones in the rooms, no fan or air conditioning, a window that opened to the street that people were using / arguing / partying on all night so it was difficult to sleep, they only cleaned our room one out of the four days we stayed, no soap for the shower, the hallways reeked of mildew and there were some really gross stains on the floor of the room. . .A few minor positives of the hotel worth mentioning: the breakfast was a fairly good deal (7,5 GBP for an all-you-can eat buffet of relatively good quality), the elevators did work (despite their web site stating that they did not) and there are a fair amount of pubs in the area of ranging nationalities, so there are places to eat and drink pretty close. . but expect to need a suit jacket to go to any of these, as this is the financial district of London and tourist clothes really make you stick out!Overall. .I wouldn't stay in this hotel again, but would probably consider staying in this area again. We were a very short tube ride from all of the touristy stuff, the neighborhood felt pretty safe, and the price was right. . but yeah, the hotel was very dirty and seems to have had all of its better years behind it. . We stayed at the Premier Inn at London King's Cross for the last 4 days of our trip, and that was an AMAZING place to stay compared to the Travelodge (and actually cost about the same amount) - I highly recommend you go there instead of here."
33,1310,"Jun 3 2009 	Great value!!	I was dubious about staying at this travel lodge, partly because of some reviews on here and partly because of previous TL experience! However the hotel was in a good location and the staff very helpful. The room was clean and spacious. Yes it was basic - there are definitely no frills here such as haridryers etc. However so long as you are prepared for this it is fine.We prebooked food in the cafe at 6 a head and whilst it is not the nicest food you will ever eat it is a total bargain and good if you want to eat there."
34,1310,"May 28 2009 	very good hotel	stayed in with my 4 and 7 yr old and husband very easy to get to from liverpool street station.hotel staff very friendly .. clean, ask for extra pillows and got them. welcoming from cleaners.front desk staff. good security needed your key to access the building and then a 2nd door:) close to a tescos metro and a M+ s and local resturants..downsides , The fryer was out of action so after we ha taken a seat and looked at the menu for 10mins was told No chips and a range of other things not avaiable.:(no vegetarian menu for the english fried breakfast..a vege sausage would have bin nice .. the breakfast set up was a bit crazed. we had a ticket for it and for kids .the first day noone seemed to want it and the 2nd day we were asked for it again and again.the lift was abit mental..floor 4 didnt seem to work..and guess wat floor we were on! ahem 4"
35,1310,"May 14 2009 	MICE!!! Beware!!	Good location, looked a little more clean than some Travelodges I've stayed in but I was woken at 5.00am to a strange sounds coming from the bin. I looked over and found mice in it. Since there are no phones and only a callcentre or a number (no front desk) I simply threw it out the window. Staff the next day were dismissive and wouldn't refund the follwing two nights I had booked. Disgusted."
36,1310,"May 2 2009 	Good Travelodge	We have stayed in a fair few Travelodges. Some good and some very bad. We thought this one was good. It was usual Travelodge spec but it was clean, well located with two tube stations close by (Liverpool Street and Aldgate) and had a nice bar/breakfast room. Whilst Liverpool street is a nice big station, Aldgate is the closest in walking distance.The girls on reception were very cheerful, polite and helpful. All in all we had a pleasant stay at this hotel which was made even nicer by the fact that we managed to get our room on one of Travelodges promotions for 19."
37,1310,"Apr 26 2009 	Felt like Fawlty Towers	I don't expect luxury when staying at a Travelodge... but this one was so bad as to be almost comical.When I arrived I was greeted by one solitary distraught-looking employee who seemed to be completely out of his depth. He was struggling with the computer system which he didn't seem to be able to get to work, and when another one of the waiting guests asked him if there was a toilet in the public area (she seemed desperate) he told her he didn't know because (quote) &quot;I don't work here&quot;. (!!!)However, he eventually managed to sort himself out sufficiently to be able to check me in. Walking to the lift I found the ground floor corridor strewn with blood-stained tissues.... perhaps I should have beaten a hasty retreat then but I was TIRED and just wanted to get to bed.But worse was to come... when I got to my room I found the bed was unmade and the bathroom had wet towels on the floor. Clearly the room had not been cleaned.I returned to the reception desk and was duly allocated another room (room 115). .. but when I got to that room I found that it was occupied! When I double-checked my card key wallet I discovered that 115 had been crossed out and 206 had been written above it... but how am I supposed to know these things if no one tells me? I made my way to room 206 which proved acceptable... though only just! There were large cracks in the wash basin and coffee stains on the desk, and the room was very cold when I arrived as the heating had been turned off. Even after I turned the heating back on the room never really warmed up, and there was quite a bad draft coming from the window.I complained to the hotel chain, and to give them their due they did phone with an apology... blaming absolutely everything that had gone wrong on the poor overworked chap behind the counter who had, apparently, been brought in at short notice to cover for someone who had gone sick."
38,1310,"Apr 23 2009 	As expected...	We stayed for two nights over Easter, and generally had a good stay. We arrived later than planned, around 1am, thanks to Ryanair, and were dealt with efficiently by the night receptionist. Unfortunately the key machine was not working so he had to escort us to our rooms. He escorted the other couple to their room first, and after three attempts, found them a room than was not a) already in use or b) unsuitable due to certain 'issues' as he put it. After getting to our rooms about 45mins after arriving at the hotel, he did kindly give us vouchers for a complimentary breakfast the next morning.The breakfast was more than ample, and at 7.95 was well priced if you were paying for it. The cooked breakfast was fresh and plentiful, and filled me up.Other than that, the room, was basic, but clean and comfortable. Excellent location, just a couple of minutes walk from Liverpool St. No complaints."
39,1310,"Apr 22 2009 	A decent no-frills lodge at a great location at a great price!	Stayed with the lodge for 3 weeks, first impression on the room.. pretty depressing, but after sometime, got used to it, and got pretty comfortable with the room. I stayed on the 2nd floor, once in a while, there will be some loud commotions between some street thugs and the police... Nonetheless, great location, friendly reception, 3-5 min away from Liverpool Street Station, bars and restaurants are easily available around the vicinity, tower of London and tower bridge are nearby, 15-20 min away. Petticoat Lane Market on Sundays, lots of Indian cuisine on Brick Lane. There's a nice Chinese Restaurant nearby as well, so food-wise, no problem. And it has got Flim4 as one of its TV programmes which helps to kill much of my boredom."
40,1310,"Apr 19 2009 	good base for a good price	a good place to stay as its an easy 5 minute walk to the tube station. Safe area and near to a few resteraunts and shops.It was basically clean,only negative things i could say was that the shower must have been blocked as the bottom filled with water and started to overflow if you wasnt quick! The other thing was you could hear a bit of noise from the tube.Other than that was perfect, clean bedding, t.v, towels changed every day, somewhere to sleep for 39 a night"
41,1310,Apr 19 2009 	Great hotel would stay again	We paid 9 a night for 3 nights at Liverpool St due to the Travelodge 9 stay. It is in a prime location for anyone who wants access to the underground as it is only five minutes walk away. It's also in a quiet area and was always peaceful. The quality of the rooms was great and it was very comfortable to sleep in. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants easy access to travel networks whilst touring London and would also recommend it to anyone who wants a cheap and comfortable stay in central London.
42,1310,"Apr 14 2009 	Just what we expected - great value	Got three nights and paid 19, 59 &amp; 89 for family of 4. No noise from street as in a quiet side street, even on 5th floor there was a distant rumble of trains from underground whihc surprised me. ALso were warned of building work, tower block being built opposite our room, however we were up and down at brakfast by 8pm each day and they hadnt started at that stage so not a problem. Breakfast room a bit small, as was our room but staff were all fine and so was breakfast, will definitely be back"
43,1310,"Apr 13 2009 	Disappointing	Booked a family room for 1 night (thank god) and the room was smaller than what was shown in the website. My parents got the bed and me &amp; wifey slept on the uncomfortable sofa bed. Only one small soap was provided even though they know we are in a family room (I would understand if it was a single or double room). We didn't bother to ask for more soap; our fault. Further, we had to climb a number of steps with our luggage before reaching the lift. Too many fire doors before we arrived to our room, and we find it quite annoying since we had to hold the door while dragging our luggage.The only reason why we decided to stay here was because we need to be at Liverpool Street station very early in the morning to catch Stansted Express. We already had in mind that we should not be expecting a Waldorf Astoria or Marriott if we choose a backpackers hotel, but never thought it would be a dreadful experience."
44,1310,"Mar 27 2009 	Great location 	Perfect location, just 5 min from Liverpool St station where Stansted express comes in. Room was adequate with en suite shower. Did not have hairdryer, but we were able to borrow one from reception.We did not have breakfast- plenty of coffee shopes etc around and we walked to Borough market in 15min to get breakfast there on Saturday and then to Spittalfields market on Sunday- 5min away.There is pay per use internet in foyer but that is very slow."
45,1310,"Mar 25 2009 	Good value bad smell	Can't complain about value for money and location but the corridor on the 4th floor smelt of bo, travelodge have since advised me they have a plumbing problem and currently fixing it."
46,1310,"Mar 23 2009 	Good enough to come back a second time	This is the second year that I have stayed at this hotel. Staff is friendly and helpful, rooms are basic and clean and the saver price makes it a really great value."
47,1310,"Mar 14 2009 	excellent location	we have stayed in this Travelodge at least 3 times in the last year or so and have never once had a problem. It is in a perfect location, so close to Liverpool Street but it is on a quiet square, off all main streets. We tried the Travelodge on City Road once but it was so horrendously noisy. It is generally cheap if you book far enough in advance. The perfect location for a cheap stopover in London if you aren't planning to spend the whole time in your room! definitely recommended."
48,1310,"Mar 12 2009 	value for money - top class	could not fault this hotel in any way. five min walk from liverpool street station where the stanstead express comes in. walking distance to algate and algate east tube station and on main bus route. hotel clean, staff helpful in every way. had breakfast in hotel and it was great value for money"
49,1310,"Mar 11 2009 	Above average for a Travelodge	I was in London for a conference, but my hotel allowance isn't great, so my first place to look for a hotel was Travelodge. I've stayed in lots of Travelodges of varying quality around the country and in London. In London I've stayed at Travelodge Royal Scot, Marylebone, Farringdon, Covent Garden and Park Royal, but this one I would rate as the best one I have stayed in when in London. It is in a quiet area because everything else is either an office block or somewhere to get a snack at lunch time, there was nothing to disturb your sleep. The other guests at the hotel (or at least the ones I saw at breakfast) seemed to be business people on their own and not tourists. The hotel is also only a 5 minute walk from Liverpool Street Station and Tube. The hotel was clean (no funny smells up the corridor that I have smelt at other Travelodges), the lift was working and the staff friendly and helpful. So if you are looking for a hotel in London that doesn't suffer from traffic noise, then I'd recommend this one to you."
50,1310,"Mar 11 2009 	Dissapointed as Generally Travelodge's are good.	Think we had that once in occasion back luck. Booked our family room 4 hrs before we arrived as our weekend trip was off the cuff!! Location was great, no problems there, in a quite area no problems there. But we where on the first floor, lift was broken so not a bad thing! At night we found out that our window would not properly close/lock, so the 'noise' from outside was very audible! We had a 'mini riot' with about 10 youths and 6 police for about 90 Min's, where language was choice, not nice when you hear ever word and your 8 year old has no option but to hear it!!The customer toilets outside the bar had a very strong urine smell that drifted along the first floor on your way to breakfast, and at breakfast the food was not all available at the same time!!Overall travelodges are a great place to rest, clean and tidy and at a very good price, but on this occasion, not up to scratch!"
51,1310,"Jan 3 2009 	Good Value and Location	Stayed here recently for one night. The room was clean but need a little redecoration maybe. However with the room rate you can't complain and after all when in London you never spend much time in the room anyway. The staff were fairly average. The location was excellent, only a few minutes walk to the tube station and the area in general felt safe to walk through at night. The only downfall is that there isnt a free luggage hold so we had to pay for the service at Liverpool Street station which was around 7.50 per item per day however as this was fairly close by wasn't too much of an issue. I would certainly book this again due to the location, especially when the room rates are on offer."
52,1310,Jan 3 2009 	good location	hotels a bit dated but as with most travelodge's cheap and you get what you pay forgood location for getting around on tube etc
53,1310,"Jan 2 2009 	29 a night - Bargain	stayed here for 5 nights between christmas &amp; new year 2008. Booked 6 months in advance and got for 29 per night. Room was clean, quiet (you could hear the rumble of the underground but it did not disturb us at all). Staff all spoke english very well. Only problem was our key card needed reprogrammed a few times. Have stayed in London many times and this was the best location and quietest area at night we have ever had. recommended."
54,1310,"Oct 14 2008 	You only get what you pay for!	Had stayed in this hotel last year so knew what to expect, or so we thought! Arrived a wee bit early but girl on reception wouldn't let us check in until three, to check in early or to leave your luggage you pay an extra 10. We arrived early (1 hour) last year and they let us check in no problems. Once checked into our room on first floor discovered window wouldn't shut properly, cold water tap came off in my hand and fold down bed was falling to bits (family room). Asked, and was given another room immediately on fifth floor. Room was fine, clean and comfortable and everything worked although was supplied with only one towel everytime cleaners had been. My wife and I in room. Really annoying having to trudge up and down stairs all the time because during our whole stay, 3 nights, lift didn't work. Just as well we are all reasonably fit. The corridor outside our room stank of dampness or something. Overall, general maintainance seems to be neglected and hotel is a bit shabby but for price and location hard to beat."
55,1310,"Oct 1 2008 	Excellent location	We had a FANTASTIC time in London on 28th and 29th September. The hotel is obviously basic, and as we only paid 29 for the room this was all we were expecting! However the room was very clean, and in a perfect location just a few minutes walk away from the underground. Check-in time was 3, something they arent very flexible on! We initially arrived at 2.10, the guy on reception was extremely rude and very unhelpful - just grunting loud enough for us to hear 'check in is not until 3'. So we waited outside for 40 minutes, which wasn't too bad as the weather was ok but it isn't something you would want to be doing in January! When we returned to the hotel at about 2.50 we were greeted by another member of reception and she couldn't have been more helpful. She even gave us a map which was attatched to lots of discount vouchers for various attractions and restaurants.Once we arrived in the room it was of a reasonable size, and had plenty of storage space for a short stay. The bed was very comfortable, and theres also a plasma in the room. Bathroom was very clean, and the noise was minimal. London is brilliant, theres lots to see and do so plan your time wisely. DONT but theatre tickets in advance as they are so much cheaper buying them on the day. The tube is very easy to work out, and the underground staff were generally very helpful. We ate in China Town on the first night and the food was excellent."
56,1310,Sep 30 2008 	Great value	The hotel is within a 5 minute walk of Liverpool Street rail station and excellent value at the 50 we paid for a double room. The room was clean and comfortable and a great base for exploring London
57,1310,"Sep 8 2008 	great value and very well situated	i stayed at this hotel 5 and 6 september and have nothing but praise.the hotel rooms were clean and reception staff efficient and check in was no problem.i asked for a sheet for the sofabed and this was sent to me immeditaly.it is very handy for visiting most of london as liverpool st station is less than 5 minutes away.there is a tesco metro store within 5 minutes and plenty of eating places within the stationif you are booking a travelodge dont expect 5 star luxury for less than a 100 pound,but you will be surprised at the size of these rooms and the good cleanliness of this onei worked 17 years in the corporate travel industry and would reccomend this hotel"
58,1310,"Sep 7 2008 	Great for the money	My husband and I stayed here for 1 night only - when we visited London in September.Whenever we visit London, we do lots of sightseeing and travel very light (backpacks only), so only ever look for cheap hotel accommodation. We only ever want somewhere clean with a decent bed and shower, and somewhere fairly close to London transport.We definitely found that here. We booked this hotel through the SuperSaver rate, so paid only 29 for the night and we were more than happy with it. All Travelodge's are much the same - therefore, you know what you're going to get, and this was just that. A room that was pretty spacious for a ridiculously cheap price for London and very close to Liverpool Street Station, and lots of bars and places to eat.Saying there for only one night, we were more than happy and would definitely stay there again For our following night, we had booked ourselves into the easyHotel at South Kensington (to be close to the museums, etc.) but after spending the night there, we wished that we had saved the extra money, stayed in the Travelodge ad jostled with the rest of the passengers on the tube at rush hour to get to where we wanted. We probably would have had a much more comfortable night and for less money. Well, you win some, you lose some! With this Travelodge, at the price, we definitely won!"
59,1310,"Aug 27 2008 	A very good if suprising experience	I stayed here whilst in London to see George Michael, I paid 29 for the room and felt it to be very good value.Travelodges are much for muchness but this one is situated in a quiet square, on the edge of the financial district (round the corner from The Guerkin), away from the main road and consequently a very good nights sleep was had. The room was small but spotlessly clean and check-in/out was efficient. and the bed was super comfy.The hotel has it's own bar/cafe but we didn't use it as the area around Liverpool Street has plenty of amenities, shops, supermarkets, pubs and places to eat.Overall a very good experience."
60,1310,Aug 11 2008 	For the price it's great !!!!!	Having stayed in a number of Travel Lodge's we were pleasantly surprised with this one.We accept that you get what you pay for and that the rooms are basic. This was huge (in comparison to others) the bath room weas enormous and you didn't feel like you were in a shoe box.The room was spotless with tea and coffee a plenty. There is a lack of toiletries but &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;. The area was fine as the underground station was 5 minutes up the road. Brick Lane / Petticoat Market etc was on the doorstep along with assorted takeaways / restaurants / pubs + clubs etc.The only thing that let it down was the negative attitude of staff (which appeared to be all foreign) they seem to have a don't care less attitude. We stayed 3 nights for the price of 88 so all in all a bargain.Get yourself a bargain with this hotel ..... book early abnd get the best deals.
61,1310,"Aug 7 2008 	Good for a weekend getaway - leave Monday morning	Not my favourite London Travelodge, although if you book well in advance the deals can be good enough to make it worthwhile. Located on the edge of The City, probably convenient for business travellers, or families catching trains from Liverpool street station on sightseeing excursions beyond London. Only services in the area are those in or around the station itself - still, that's a lot, just plan to take things back to the room when you're on the way back - large supermarket between the station and hotel it's not so close that you will want to just pop downstairs to buy a sandwich. Noise during the week will be a problem for some. It was quiet Saturday and Sunday, but at 08:00 Monday morning building works recommenced on one of the largest towers being built in London, directly behind the hotel. You won't have any quiet time to relax in the room on weekdays as long as those are going on."
62,1310,"Aug 2 2008 	At least it was cheap....	I needed somewhere to crash out after going to the British Motor Show, and I happened to be lucky in securing a room in this hotel with one of Travelodge's SuperSaver deals. So I got this 3-star big-name hotel room in Central London for a measily 30. Not bad eh???The hotel is in the City - a short 5 minute walk from Liverpool Street station great if you are coming in from Stansted plus it is on the Central Line of the Tube so easy access to Soho and the West End (remember that the Square Mile is a ghost town at evenings and weekends!)., plus close to the East End and Docklands so handy if you are going to ExCel (as I was) or the O2. But it takes a bit of effort to find it - it's buried down a little narrow lane just off Bishopsgate and next to a not-very-attractive concrete council housing estate (odd thing to see in the City of London!) . Things went pear shaped however when I checked in. There seemed to be just one person on duty on the desk and he didn't smile, or say very much. He also seemed to be responsible for everything (duty manager, handyman, room service!). The hotel lobbies were well vacuumed but there was musty stench permeating through the whole place. The sole elevator had a blown lightbulb so it felt dark and claustrophobic - plus it was exceptionally dirty. The room was clean and tidy enough, but there was only one towel. I went back down to reception to get another, and Mr. Miserable at the desk said he would come up with one. It didn't appear. The hotel promised internet access in every room - although I didn't have my laptop with me I looked at the wireless router screwed onto the underside of the worksurface - all its wires had been snipped!! Then I discovered the kettle didn't work so I couldn't make tea/coffee in my room. Leaving the hotel to go to the West End in the evening for something to eat (by this time I had no intention or risking the hotel's restaurant!), I once again mentioned this to Mr. Miserable. Predictably nothing was done about it. There was a different guy on duty when I got back, and a replacement kettle was despatched immediately, but it didn't work either. Obviously a wiring problem with the socket or a blown fuse. At least the bed was very comfortable and I had a good night's sleep - be aware that the Circle Line between Liverpool Street and Aldgate runs right below the building and you CAN hear the distant rumbling of trains although it didn't bother me.Okay - I didn't pay a lot for the room and for 30 in the centre of London I certainly couldn't complain on the money front, but given that someone turning up on the day and getting charged the regular rate of 75-80 would have got the same deplorable standard of service it is completely unacceptable. So I would say only consider this hotel if you can get the cheapest SuperSaver rates.....otherwise avoid it."
63,1310,"Jun 30 2008 	rip off	we stayed here overnight 2 weeks ago.we arrived at 1430 and were told check in is at 3pm.were asked to pay 10 to check in 30 mins earlier, which we declined. waited till 3.the room was clean but very basic for 105.we had room 101 it was quite noisy and i was happy to be gone the next day. i would not pay that to stay there again."
64,1310,"May 24 2008 	Hit and Miss	This Travelodge has the ability to do very well given its location, however there is a general hit and miss attitude throughout the hotel.I arrived at 3pm and there was already a queue, the reception staff were changing shift and made everybody wait until they had finished counting their floats.The room was as expected, perfectly comfortable and at least you could open the windows, something which is unusal for Travelodges.The Bar Cafe was okay, except half of the menu was unavailable and only one staff member in attendance who seemed to be doing everything including the washing up so everything took ages. Breakfast was much the same, only one staff member doing everything, however to be fair the food offered was perfectly acceptable and in my opinion worth the cost.All in all, the location is ideal if you have work in the city or have to catch the train to Stansted, not sure I'd pay the full rack rate, but the internet rate I paid was fine."
65,1310,"Apr 12 2008 	Service? How do you spell that?	The hotel is conveniently located in the City, therefore 108 GBP seemed to be a reasonable price for the room I booked. Or was it?When I arrived, I encountered a receptionist who barely spoke English, but after several attempts finally found my name in his PC. My room was on the first floor, close to the staircase and its creaking door that would be my constant entertainment during the night. Well, sometimes I was distracted by police sirens, or even the sound of heels on the street - after doublechecking the window I had to notice that it was indeed closed - unbelievable.There was one towel in the bathroom (although it was a double room), no shampoo or shower gel and the shower was a bit &quot;battered&quot;. In the room, it was slightly too &quot;windy&quot; (the window again) but I was able to offset it by turning the heating to full power. Only one of the two bedside lamps had a light bulb - unfortunately on the &quot;windy&quot; side - but changing it did not help either - for some reason it did not work on the other side at all.Let's turn to something more positive - in the next morning I finally checked out. I had an appointment and wanted to leave my bag in the hotel for several more hours. I was told that this would be impossible due to &quot;security reasons&quot;, but that I could opt for a late check out (at only 10 GBP) - my bag apparently is less dangerous when I pay an extra charge.....But enough is enough, my bag spent the morning in the left luggage room of Liverpool station and I did not have to come back to the hotel again!Consider very carefully how much you are willing to pay for this hotel, 29 GBP is a reasonable price due to the location, but otherwise - there are also &quot;real&quot; hotels for the price I paid -even in London!"
66,1310,"Apr 11 2008 	Very Impressed	I stayed for one night in January 2008 as an easy stop after a concert at the O2. I wasnt actually expecting much but I was surprised, the reception staff were helpful, the room neat, tidy and clean. The floor we were on was being redecorated at the time which Im sure if it was a longer stay may have been disruptive but over one night was not a problem and I was impressed that they were going to the trouble to keep the place looking nice. There were a couple of down points, the breakfast was quite expensive in my opinion (7.00 or 7.50 I cant remember now) but it was a continental buffet; and with the room the shower curtain was broken and I found the room very hot to sleep in, an big problem when you cant open the window over 2 inches and if you do the noise outside keeps you awake. Proximity to Liverpool Street station was brilliant, although I did have a little trouble finding the Travelodge as their website doesnt really explain the directions clearly."
67,1310,"Apr 1 2008 	Cheap and simple if a little noisy	We stayed for three nights at this hotel and it's a reasonable place to stay. Booking months in advance produced a 29 per night rate, not sure I'd be pleased paying the 85 rack rate.The room was clean with tea &amp; coffee (no spoons!), a TV and not much else. One towel and three pillows for two people, we had to ask for more but they came promptly and with a smiling service.The location is excellent, close to Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations both a couple of minutes walk away. Handy too for the Spitalfields and Brick Lane Markets on a Sunday.Only have a couple of annoyances which maybe aren't the fault of the hotel. A fire alarm on Friday at 130am meant the whole hotel evacuated for half a hour while the fire brigade took a look. I'd rather be safe than scorched, but this is the third time in the past few stays in Travelodges this has happened, not just at this branch.The other nuisance is the building work going on at the end of the hotel opposite the reception - very loud building work (placing foundations) starting at 8am and finishing at 7pm - doesn't really help you sleep.There is also the very noticable noise of what sounded like a tumble drier running all night long - this may have been a generator to do with the building works or the hotels own laundry - either way it's an unwelcome accompaniment to a night's sleep.The solution would be to ask for a room on the non-gherkin side and near the reception.Don't be out off though, this is a good hotel at the discount rate, well situated and clean."
68,1310,"Mar 25 2008 	Better than a park bench....just.	Extreme fans of budget airlines might love this one....everyone else stay away.Good points - Location on the fringes of The City, close to station.Small LCD TV in room.Bad points -Surly receptionist - couldn'd find booking but didn't bother checking to see if fax confirmation received.Heater in room switched off, controls so close to wall that they are invisible. Noise from building site right outside window unbearable. The world's smallest bar of soap, the only toiletry supplied - no shampoo, not even a soap dispenser on the wall...nothing.Bathroom heater disconnected (wires cut) presumably to save more money (Travelodge been receiving coaching from Cryingair perhaps?). Breakfast not worth the extra charge.All in all a miserable experience with the overriding feeling that Travelodge blatantly wishes to retain every penny possible from each customer as profit by giving absolutely the bare minimum in return. Good plan for one off visitors but not for regular business, except of course those who can not see past the &quot;bargain&quot; price of 105 per night midweek.Experience at your peril!"
69,1310,"Dec 4 2007 	Delighted with Travelodge London Liverpool Street	We stayed here for 3 nights arriving late on Friday night. The hotel is very close to Liverpool Street Station, and just around the corner from the Tesco Metro which is ideal for snacks and supplies. We checked in with no problem and our room on the 6th floor, although compact, was clean and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like about the room was the shower curtain, it made the shower very difficult to use and caused the floor to get soaked with every use. Why can't we have a shower screen instead of a horrible unhygienic curtain? The room was also a wee bit noisy at times but then I would expect that in central London. Didn't use the restaurant as there were loads of pubs, etc, nearby where we enjoyed excellent pub lunches. Liked: The price - 50 per night (bargain for central London, and I see some reviewers got it even cheaper); clean comfortable room; great location (literally 5 mins to Liverpool Street underground).Disliked: The shower curtain.No major problems or complaints - if you are looking for luxury you won't be considering a Travelodge, however if you want good, clean, comfortable and fairly cheap accomodation in central London I would recommend this hotel."
70,1310,"Nov 2 2007 	Does Anyone speak English Here?	ok....where do you want us to start about this &quot;fine&quot; establishment?day one: check in ...only one person working in the entire hotel complex who i have to say was a multitasker as he acted as barman...receptionist, random troubleshooter, waiter, handyman, chef and did not speak one yes one word of english!!we checked in at 5pm after a much confusion over why we were at the desk in the first place. after many hand gestures and loud slowly spoken english words we were rewarded with a battered room key card which didnt swipe. our room was on the third floor... it seemed ok at first but closer inspection revealed a sofa bed and chair covered in questionable stains, a toilet which had a handle resembling a wooden spoon that kept falling off after use, taps in the sink which had to be held in place during use and a bath that time had forgot. as other guests have mentioned in previous reviews we were also left the trademark travelodge half bottle of shampoo... to get you settled in during your stay.heat in the room was unbearable as there was no air conditioning and the window only opened an inch to prevent you from escaping. we were told the restaurant opened at 5pm but when we got there at 5:10pm it was still locked with no staff in sight until.....a few minutes later the man of many talents from reception appeared with his chef's hat on ready to go into action. however, we could not order drinks or food until another member of staff (ie. the translator) arrived who spoke some english. he proceeded to show other people to our seats which he thought was amusing. the meals we ordered were not available so instead of refund we were given cheap, tasteless alternatives. room service was not an option as rooms did not have phones. if you wanted to eat in your room you had to go to the &quot;restaurant&quot; and carry food and drinks to your room yourself through the stale smell of dirty linen and sweat that hovered in the corridors. although the room did have a comfortable bed, it was wasted as a good nights sleep was impossible due to the construction work starting at 5:57 every morning and late night police chases past the hotel on a regular basis. during our stay the fire alarm also went off at 8:00am. evacuation seemed to be optional.. we gathered across the street with unconcerned members of staff and fellow guests who informed us that this happens all the time! when we were allowed back in we went for breakfast but there were no members of staff manning the restaurant to prepare food or take our order. after 45mins of heated debate with the waitress who didnt speak english we left unfed and went to the smoothie bar across the road. When we tried to return to our room the key wouldnt work so we had to go to the reception to get it re-swiped as the hotel had been giving out old swipe cards. The only good thing was being able to leave. Overall, a really disappointing and stressful experience."
71,1310,"Oct 12 2007 	Bare bones	I just returned from a business trip to London. It was booked at the last minute so most hotels in The City were close to or fully occupied. Coming from the US with a group of 3 people this hotel was of close proximity to our client. It was a hotel at a reasonable rateconsidering the weakness of the US dollar in the UK. The good:Clean roomsgood locationcomfortable bedBest value in the area.The not so good:Noisy surroundingsNo telephone in the room or pay telephone in the hotel lobby. The closest was three blocks away.No alarm clock in the room and since I had a US cellphone with no service, I was not able to use the alarm clock feature.Wireless internet had spotty serviceAlthough the frontdesk people were pleasant, many did not have a firm grasp of the english languageMany of the cable tv stations did not have sound.Overall, if you need a comfortable bed and clean room this would fit the bill. For the discriminating traveler, this is not a hotel for you."
72,1310,"Sep 26 2007 	Good location but very noisy	We stayed in room 616, and at 4am we had a very loud sound (sounded like a generator) and the vibrations of the entire room felt like it was going to take off to space. This continued till about 7 am! eventually we moved rooms only to find out the other side of the building had builiding works...more noise!"
73,1310,Sep 18 2007 	smashing location	Would reccomend staying here for two main reasons. 1. Price - 52 for a two night stay in central London can't be bad 2. location is brill 5minute wlak for liverpool st then just go and see london.
74,1310,"Sep 13 2007	Comfortable beds but nothing else good to say.	Just finished a business stay at this hotel. First of all the good stuff. The location is great, right near Liverpool Street train station and near Devonshire Square, The Gherkin and the financial district. Also the bed is very large and comfortable with lovely soft pillows.The downside: Travelodge have removed any type of luxury from the room and left a depressing laminated card explaining why there is no bath mat in the shower. Toiletries consist of a tiny bar of soap not replaced during my stay.The room was extremely hot (no airconditioning) opening the window brought the sounds of traffic, some dodgy flats at the back of the hotel and extremely loud construction work starting about 7.30 which meant I never had to set my alarm.The food, both dinner and breakfast is inedible, please do not eat here, there are plenty of great restaurants nearby. Both meals I ordered here were returned for a refund, they were that bad.Booking here for 15 pounds a night would be a great deal, but for over 100 it was a depressing experience."
75,1310,"Sep 3 2007 	at this price...no complaints!	this hotel is in a great location, but they wont take bags if you arrive early , so if you do , leave your bags in liverpool st station to avoid carrying them back up!! its 6.50 a bag to store them there. the hotel itself was fine, clean rooms , plenty of tea /coffee, just ask at reception if you need more, they are friendly enough for a cheap and cheerful hotel, i stayed for 2 nights aug 26-28 in a family room with 2 kids, 26 pounds a night for 3 people in london is a steal! must say though they really should clean the carpets in the corridors , they absolutely stink, not so in the rooms just there. cafe bar was average, but the breakfast was a disaster, staff had little english , hadnt a clue who had ordered and everyone was left standing around for 20 mins whilst the waitress went to get milk! we left and bought breakfast elsewhere just to avoid this happening to us too! overall, its great for the price and really near all sights because of train station, id stay again at this price and would highly recommend it for a cheap and cheerful weekend ."
76,1310,"Aug 29 2007 	Make sure they give you a non occupied room!	Me, my partner and a friend booked to stay at the hotel on August bank holiday Sunday. Me and my partner had booked well in advance and got the superb 26.00 rate. Our friend who booked later booked a rate of 50.00.The walk from Liverpool Street station is effortless and no struggle even if you have large cases. You even walk past a large Tesco Metro which was ideal for us to stock on essentials.We tried to check in early but they said the rooms hadnt been cleaned. Be warned that they do NOT have a left luggage facility so either lug your bags around or there is a facility on platform 10 at Liverpool St Station which costs 6.50 for 24hours. The staff at the hotel are all foreign and speak very broken English. Me and my partner checked in ok with the non smoking room that we had booked, however our friend booked the same and ended up with a smoking room. The staff didnt seem at all bothered and said that there were no other rooms available. So off we plodded and went to see our friends room. The corridoor stunk of smoked, we opened the room and it was occupied. Luckily there was no one in the room at the time but all the persons possesions were. God knows what would of happened if someone had of been in there. We went back down to complain. Again the check in staff and the manager werent the slightest bit bothered or apologetic and couldnt explain why someone was in there. They said &quot;check out is at 12pm so if he iis still in there I dont know why&quot; - Like they were saying it wasnt their problem. Anyhow after kicking up a fuss, they amazingly found a NON smoking room (after saying they didnt have one available). This room was fine as was our. The rest of the stay was fine and what you expect from the travelodge. The room was clean, tidy, modern. They all have tvs with the normal channels plus 3 sky channels and radio. There is also tea and coffee making facilities. Dont expect any more than this. I have had read reviews on here from other people complaining that they dont get shampoos and showergel. Just ignore them!The hotel has a cafe which we didnt use but looked ok.All in all the hotel itself is absolutely great for how much you pay and where it is, but the staff really let it down and couldnt give too monkeys. Just be careful when opening your room door for the first time!"
77,1310,"Aug 24 2007 	Excellent Location and CHEAP!!	Stayed here for one night in August due to its close location to the Liverpool Street's Stansted Express Service. We only paid 26 by booking on the Travelodge website well in advance. A fantastic price for a hotel in central London. The room was clean, had tea making facilities and a television. The en suite was also clean and had a shower, no bath but that wasn't a problem. We checked in after midnight due to our delayed flight arriving at Gatwick. The late check in caused no problems with the well manned reception. It was only a 16 taxi fare from Victoria Street Station and the Gatwick Express Service which we though was very reasonable. The tube link would have been cheaper but wasn't available at the time we arrived. We didn't notice the noise from outside and had a short walk to the train station in the morning. What more do you need? All for 26!"
78,1310,"Aug 13 2007 	Good value for the price 	I stayed here with my wife for a short getaway to celbrate our anniversary. Having stayed in Travelodges before we knew pretty musch what to expect as they are no frills.The room was clean and spacious for 2 people. The only downside was an amount of noise that came in when you had the window open, due to the fact there is a tower block next door and the hotel is in the middle of the City of London. If it is cool enough to close the window, the problem ceases."
79,1310,"Aug 1 2007 	we don't do that!	Myself and two girl-friends stayed at liverpool street travellodge on a two night break in london. On arrival at 2.20pm we were told we could not access our rooms as they had not been cleaned. Mix up straight away about times for checking in. We had suit cases with us and were vey tired and hungry. Asked about leaving the cases to go and eat. 'We don't do that'. Bar/cafe in hotel closed, machine for a drink in reception OUT OF ORDER! Waited and eventually allowed in rooms at 2.45pm. Totally unhelpful staff on reception, no idea about eating places nearby, no maps. No usual information booklet in room about locality. EXCEPT... a card with all the 'we don't do thats'. No toiletries due to guests taking them! Half used tiny bottles of shower/shampoo and a shower cap is hardly the great train robbery! No hairdryer, no contact with reception (phone), No biscuits with tea an coffee. NOISE. if there is one thing that travellodges boast about it's the fact that you are practically guaranteed a good nights sleep. Night: screeching cars, followed by police sirens. Morning: 5.57am...building work begins on the street below (side street). Had to keep window closed...hence too hot in room!. Banging doors in the travellodge night and day. Have stayed in many different travellodges all over England and have always been more than hapy. This one.....NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"
80,1310,Jul 20 2007 	does what it says on the tin	Its a lodge for travellers. No pretentious or over fussyness. Hotel was clean. rooms were clean and bed was comfortable. Shower nice and hot. If you want a base close to london liverpool st and dont want to be fussed over and what to do your own thing then this is the place. The bar/cafe was also very good and it had air/con !! Had a decent breakfast and evening meal cooked there. Loads of other resturant facilitys in the area. I do recoment the Thai Buddah on Middlesex St a stones throw from the hotel for a great thai meal.Check in and check out was a breeze. ok this didnt feel like a hotel where you were going to get pampered but that isnt what Travellodge is for. They have cut to the chase and delivered a basic service that is effecient. it does what it says on the tin.
81,1310,"Jul 10 2007	Value Budget Accommodation in London	This is a good budget hotel in a good location in London. Completely no frills, but you get a good bed and a good shower. Room was clean and perfectly acceptable. When you consider the prices of hotels in London you can not do much better than Travelodge. Recommend a Family Room if you want extra space as these rooms are large and have a couch."
82,1310,"May 30 2007	Sort out the doors!	This was my 1st visit to London and I needed somewhere close to Liverpool Street so this travelodge was the obvious choice.Pro'sGood distance from train stationCleanComfortableConsNoisy - It was warm as there is no air con and so I had to open the window but it was noisyNoise again - PEOPLE CLOSING THEIR BEDROOM DOORS! I wanted to catch up on some sleep on my 2nd day but couldn't because when people on the corridor left their rooms, my room would shake after the big bang of the doors slamming. Overall it was OK, but I didn't get the sleep that I booked the hotel for."
83,1310,"Apr 17 2007	Good value for 26 a night	Booked three rooms for two nights for a Friday &amp; Saturday for 26 a night via the Travelodge website. Essentially all we wanted was a decent base / room for a weekend of fun &amp; alcohol refreshment; nearly all the time we expected to be out and about.Even though the price was right, you should still expect certain standards. A clean Room in decent nick, a decent shower, bed &amp; who knows some quietness! In all aspects the rooms delivered. Modern room, basic but clean - feels like a newish TL. Really powerful shower and quiet rooms, apart from some noise from builders outside the TL at 9am on Saturday.Location is central and convenient for tube - 5 minutes walk from Liverpool Street; follow the instructions from the websites own page. Didn't sample the food / drink on offer but there is a bar/cafe on site. Spot on for what we wanted for the weekend and I would recommend this place if your needs are similar to ours. Did exactly what you should expect from the TL brand."
84,1310,"Mar 2 2007 	Brilliant for 15.00 a night	Definately a bargain at 15.00 a night , having read the reviews from other travellers about this Travelodge I was prepared, so checked in early and was given a room on the 4th Floor so I would not be kept awake by the sound of the Circle and Hammersmith and City lines rumbling below the rooms on the 1st and 2nd floorsShower was functional and worked, although by the third night i was really wanting a bath which is the only major downside to this particular Travelodge if you are staying consecutive nights.The TV worked, the duvet was nice and warm. The room was at a nice temperature and the pillows were firmer than some in more upmarket establishments I've stayed in.Yes the hotel was a little noisy with slamming doors, but at the end of the day this has more to do with the type guests which stay at most Travelodges over the weekend. Think white stillettos and gold chains with no brains..... Rack rate at weekends is 75.00 per night, would I pay this rate? absoultely no way, but at 15.00 per night this is ideal"
85,1310,Feb 27 2007 	Errr... FIne...	Want a place to crash that's close to Liverpool Street station? Our room was clean. The shower was hot and worked. The bed was fairly comfortable. The TV had 5 channels. There were tea and coffee making facilities. Check in and out was effortless. We paid a reasonable rate for a reasonable room...WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? It's a Travelodge. We were travelling and needed somewhere to lodge... It does what it says... No complaints...
86,1310,"Feb 22 2007 	Clean and convenient - just a little 'tired' looking	I stayed for 2 nights in February.The reception staff were friendly enough. The first thing I noticed is that there is about 5 or so steps to climb to get to the lift. Not easy when you are carrying a heavy suitcase....The room was quite spacious compared to another hotel I had stayed in. There was room for a double bed, bedside tables, a desk, drawers and hanging space. It was also clean enough, although appeared to be 'tired' and in need of a little updating.I only paid 26 pounds after booking directly on the hotel website. I was more than happy with the room, considering the price I paid. It was a short walk to Liverpool St tube station, so it was easy enough to get around London.My only gripe would be that the window didn't stay shut and everytime we had a shower, the bathroom flooded - we fixed that problem by requesting extra towels and laying them on the floor. We didn't bother complaining as we were barely there - only to sleep.If you're able to get a cheap rate, this hotel would be okay as a base."
87,1310,"Jan 16 2007	Very very average	Granted this hotel was cheap as I had booked it well in advance, with a single night's accomodation just 49.This aside, there are certain things that are crucial to any hotel, be it budget or 5 star and this particular Travelodge did not tick many of the boxes.- Only one of the 3 lights in the room worked.- The TV was on permanent LOUD setting, with the volume down button broken (not a particular problem though to be fair, although it would have been nice to be able to watch TV while getting ready).- Taps did not turn off entirely, hence there was the sound of running water all night.- I woke regularly to the sound of trains running past (not sure where - underground?) and bin lorries reversing from the service areas of the Bank buildings opposite at silly AM.- There was a disturbing electrical spark emerging from the collection of wires underneath the TV. - Pillows were incredibly lumpy, which made for an uncomfortable night.Don't get me wrong, I know and understand that you get what you pay for. However, all of the above problems with the exception of the external noise are well within the remit of any hotel to notice and fix. Being there for only one night meant that the hotel did not have the opportunity to fix the problem while I was there, but even so, if that is indicative of the standard of general repair of a Travelodge, then I will not be returning. Even at 49, this was overpriced. I would have expected better from a hostel at 19 a night."
88,1310,"Jan 1 2007 	Keep expectations (and hence these reviews) in line with the price paid....	First of all - remember, keep expectations (and hence these reviews) in line with the price paid.Nice new hotel in a very good location and at super saver rate paid a true bargain, but at normal rate not so sure given basic nature of rooms and no breakfast inc. Only problem was noise penetrating through the foundations from the circle underground line trains beneath hotel. On 3rd floor wasnt too bad but lower down could well be! The hotel was in a very quiet area (at weekends anyway) so maybe made the underground noise seem worse.Agree very much with previous review, keep expectations low and it is fine. It is not a 4* establishment but is spotlessly clean and has features such as powershowers but no aircon or toiletries (other than soap bar)."
89,1310,"Oct 31 2006 	Keep Your Expectations Modest and Be Satisfied	The Travelodge London Liverpool St is no-frills accommodation located in the City, walking distance from both the Liverpool St rail station and Aldgate tube station. Our one-night stay was booked at the 26 rate, prepaid; therefore, this review is calibrated to reflect such a rock-bottom price.Our smallish double room was clean, exceedingly so, which is our foremost requirement for a hotel room, no matter the price. Secondarily, I need quiet, and we had no problems whatsoever with noise. As other reviewers have noted, there was no AC in the room, which certainly would have greater significance in the heat of summer, and there seemed to be no way to contact reception via telephone. While the room itself was clean, a general state of disrepair was evident: the curtains drooped from missing clips, and one of the night stands was simply torn from the wall and not replaced. In the bathroom, which was shower only, there was but one towel (albeit a giant one), a tiny bar of soap and two plastic drinking glasses. Basic, indeed.We had no problems with our reservation, nor any subsequent contact with hotel staff beyond check-in, so we cant comment on their receptiveness to service requests. Also, we did not stay long enough to visit the caf on the premises.The location of the hotel was convenient for our needs; however, be aware the City is a ghost town outside of business hours. Our predawn walk to the Aldgate station was a bit on the creepy side. Single travelers or those looking for a variety of eating and drinking choices in close proximity to their hotel might need to take note.Overall, we were more than satisfied with our brief stay, given the low rate. For those unable to book the promotional rate, such a recommendation must be tempered. Its unlikely the Travelodge Liverpool St will be the highlight of anyones visit to London, but if all you require is a decent nights sleep and a hot shower, it may well fit the bill."
90,1310,"Oct 14 2006 	Unbeatable value for money	26 for a night in a clean double en suite room right in the heart of London's business area and just a couple of minutes walk from Liverpool St Station. I cant imagine too many places could match that.Make no mistake, this is a no frills hotel and doesn't pretend to be anything else. Travel Lodges tend to get very bad reviews for reasons which I have yet to work out - My sole complaint being that the coffee cups didnt look like they had been washed properly. I checked in late (about midnight) and had no problems and a good nights sleep.If you are looking for somewhere cheap and cheerful to stay when in London and dont require 5 star treatment - look no further."
91,1310,Oct 12 2006 	Disasterous Stay	Great if you like the sound of trtains running underneath you every 5 mins. Ok if you dont mind being stuck in your room whilst a psycho smashes up the corridor outside your room with a fire estinguisher at 3am - and there is no way you can contact security/reception using the phone provided. Avoid - especially for 90 without breakfast.

1,1311,"Was close to work was the best reason for being there	Room was finished to a terrible looking DIY standard. Shower curtains were marked, windows full of condensation and bottom of loo was brown. I had noisy room at the front onto main road. Wouldn't go back unless it was my last resort (and then I'd pay more to go elsewhere and travel into the office from further away."
2,1311,"Nov 24 2009 	Depressing. Worth paying a bit extra and going elsewhere.	The room was grim - there were brown burn marks on the shower curtain. It was clean though. For central London the hotel was cheap and the location was great. However, for what you get it wasn't good value for money and I would definitely prefer to pay an extra 20 and stay somewhere less depressing."
3,1311,"Nov 17 2009 	Good value although not many facilities close to hotel	The hotel is fine, clean and basic but that's all you're paying for with their low prices. There was TV, tea/coffee and towels in the room. You have to provide your own tolietries and hairdryer but they tell you that in advance on their wesbite. The staff were fine and the buffet breakfast was nice enough.Biggest disadvantage is the fact that there are little to no bars/restaurants close by, we arrived late on a Friday night and the only place we could find was at Baker St and at that it was a kebab shop!!Would recommend if you were sure you weren't going to need a meal near the hotel!"
4,1311,"Nov 10 2009 	Depressing!	A long overdue review... Booked the Travelodge due to proximity to LBS (was attending a course) and value - sadly by the time I booked there was no early bird rate and I paid full price. Being a hotelier, wasn't expecting much in terms of service and luxury...but was depressed when I walked in the room! The size of the single room is appalling - like entering a broom closet! The plumbing needed dire repairs - nauseating smells even when bathroom was not in use... and mattress was super-uncomfortable. Missing amenities were not replenished and had to ask to fix the electronic key everyday. Only saving grace was location...but would never stay here again."
5,1311,"Oct 24 2009 	Great value hotel excellent location.	After reading several of the reviews here I was really worried, however please note that since the majority were written this place has obviously had a real makeover. The staff were all lovely, friendly and helpful, The corridors were spotless and the room was a good size and obviously very clean and newly decorated. This is easily the best Travel Lodge I've ever stayed in. The bathroom had a real bath, not just a tiny shower cubicle and was tiled and newly painted, it was also very clean. The bed was very comfortable (some Travel Lodges have terrible beds that collapse when you lay on them) and the sheets and towels were clean and fresh. There was plenty of tea/coffee/milk provided.The only complaint is that it was late October and the heating still hadn't been switched on in the building. It was a little chilly in the room when I went there to relax for a couple of hours in the early evening but, surprisingly when I returned from my night out the room seemed much warmer so I didn't need the extra blankets the helpful man in reception had offered me when I asked about the heating.Anyone who complains about lack of toiletries and size of the soap bar is really just being petty. This is a Travel Lodge, you get what you pay for and who needs a large bar of soap when you are only sleeping overnight in a room?I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a really convenient (right next to Marylebone Station) London hotel at a low price."
6,1311,"Oct 18 2009 	OK but a bit tatty and not usual Travelodge standard	Stayed here for the location - right near the tube station, near Baker Street with all its restaurants, easy to find, Marks &amp; Spencers near it open till late. Friendly enough man on reception. But although the room was large, it was a bit too plain and empty. Double bed, with clean sheets and one spare pillow. Kettle, two t-bags, coffee sachets, milk. Small TV on wall. Two large clean towels, in a tired old bathroom, which was a bit dirty, very old fittings, badly added sealant around bath and paneling falling apart in places. No hairdryer. Small bar of soap and two plastic cups at the sink. Nothing special. A place to hang up clothes, but no drawers. A desk and chair. I wouldn't go back again - expensive for what you got. Really nothing special. And the fire alarm that went off my mistake on Sunday morning at 8:30, then again at 8:40 didn't help much... and we weren't even sure what to do.. it was only on for a few seconds each time, but enough to wake us up!!"
7,1311,"Oct 15 2009 	Hotel Review	great value for price, given that it is perfectly located in the centre of london, and is few min away from all nice streets, oxford,etc..."
8,1311,"Oct 14 2009 	Convenient location	Pros: Excellent location right off the Marylebone Underground stop. There's a small Marks &amp; Spencer grocery store nearby so we were able to buy food conveniently. The room and bed were large and clean, but pretty bare-bones. The food prices in the restaurant weren't bad, either.Cons: We had to ask for more towels twice and ended up having to take them up ourselves from the front desk. We had to pay 10 pounds for early check-in because there were no left-luggage facilities and we didn't want to sit around in the lobby until 3 PM. As it was, I had to leave our luggage with my fiance and go get us sandwiches from M&amp;S while we waited another hour for our room. And there's no internet in the rooms - just 2 computers in the lobby which charge a pound per minute.And maybe it's just the British version of customer service, but the staff didn't exactly wait on us hand and foot. However, when we got our bottle opener stuck in a bottle of wine, the bartender laughed and opened it for us.Bottom line: handy location, not the best value, plan your arrival time carefully."
9,1311,Oct 9 2009 	One of the better Travelodges	Stayed for 4 nights in total either side of a Holiday from Heathrow (cheaper and easier than staying &quot;on airport&quot;) Staff friendly enough for London. Given a largish room overlooking the side of the station.Clean modern and functional.The king size bed was a little of the cheap side( mattress) but slept ok saying that.The best thing about this place is its so handy for the station and more importantly the tube(when you have suitcases!) Its roughly 15-20 meters from the tube to the hotel. There is an M&amp;S in the station so very easy grabbing a couple of croissants for breakfast without forking out 7 ish for the hotels breakfast.Defiantly one of the better Travelodges.
10,1311,"Oct 5 2009 	Shocking customer service - went from being a great stay to a terrible one!	We stayed in Travelodge Marylebone for 4 nights in September. We had booked a few months previous online, booking their saver rate rooms for a great price. It wasn't the easiest booking system to use - you couldn't just punch in your start date to end date for the cheaper rooms - you had to book each night individually and hope you were given the same room for the entire stay. We thought we had booked four nights, but somehow managed to only book three. Problem was that we weren't aware of this and nobody let us know until 4pm on the day we were supposed to leave! Yes, I realise this was our mistake, but when we checked in the receptionist asked how many nights we were staying, we replied 'four' she then went on to say 'so checking out on Tuesday 8th' which was correct so we had no reason to think that we had booked wrong.Each day we had to go back and get our swipe key reprogrammed which was no problem. On the Monday (the day before we were leaving) we got back at 3pm, got our key reprogrammed and went back to our room. We realised we only had one towel, so my friend went back downstairs - she came back a few minutes later saying we weren't booked in for that night and if we didn't pay 100 for that night straight away we would have to leave and pay a late check out fee. I found this very confusing as just an hour before we had been at reception getting our key reprogrammed and nothing was mentioned!We went downstairs and spoke to the girl on reception who was extremely rude to us, so we asked to speak to the manager. The manager has obviously no idea of customer service as he too was extremely rude, raising his voice several times, all in front of other customers. We admitted that obviously we had made a mistake with our booking, but we couldn't understand how it hadn't been picked up until late that afternoon - if we had been told at check in we could have easily arrange alternative accomodation for the last night. At 4pm though, that was a little trickier. He would accept no responsibility despite us being told at check in that we were there for 4 nights. He told us that the receptionist would have had no way of seeing how long we were booked in for (??) and she would have taken our word for it! In the end we had no choice and had to pay for that night's accommodation. He would not budge on the price, charging us the walk in rate, despite us having stayed there for the previous three nights.As with other people who have reviewed this hotel, I found making a complaint extremely difficult, and all I got in return was an email from the manager saying he did not mean to come across an confrontational. No apology and nothing to try and smooth over the situation.This hotel went from being in our minds a great one - because it does have a lot to offer in terms of location, price etc. to a terrible one. I would never stay here again based on the extremely poor customer service."
11,1311,"Sep 23 2009 	great staff	stayed here september 21st firstly this was the cleanest travelodge i have ever stayed in and the staff were really helpful and friendly the lady even called &quot;thank you for staying with us&quot;.we check in early and paid 10 extra and it was nice the receptionist gave us a option of floor.After a small mix up with our room we were offered a free breakfast.breakfast would have cost 7.50 each but I must admit the breakfast was not too good.we would not want to pay 7.50 , when theres a wetherspoon pub at baker street 5 minutes away serving breakfast.all in all will good back its a great location right near madame tussauds and only a 10 minute walk to oxford street."
12,1311,"Sep 22 2009 	Average hotel average value for money	The Travelodge Marylebone was a convenient base for us as we travelled to Marylebone station on Chiltern Railways. Apart from this advantage, thearea is a little way off the public transport network and we spent a fair bit of time waiting for buses.Staff at the hotel were very efficient and gave a warm welcome by Travelodge standards. The room was basic and rather austere, but did benefit from a full size bath, however the hot water was very warm, not hot!This 80 a night hotel becomes more like 95, when you factor in the cost of breakfast and left luggage at a local station (16!). Why can't Traveldodge offer this service for free, like so many other hotels?"
13,1311,Sep 15 2009 	Priced right for what you get....	Stayed here for 3 nights...room 413.....comparing room size with other hotels I've stayed in London this was ok. Rooms were nice and tidy and perhaps because it was on the 4th floor it was not as noisy as i had anticipated having read some reviews. there are no airconditioners in the rooms and may not be the best choice in summer. the furnishing also needs some revamp if the management want to avoid future ratings goings south
14,1311,"Sep 15 2009 	Dreadful - Replace the mattresses. V Poor customer services.	Stayed there 9 Sept as had a meeting very early next morning (early enough to prevent getting train up from the West country), PA booked the (single) room for me. Normally I have no problem with Travelodge (though prefer Premier Inn) and have stayed at many around the country - most budget hotels being better than the average 3* to be honest. Anyway, arrived and checked in to my room (604 - I think) having unpacked, layed out on the bed and my god, what a bad mattress - thin and wires/springs very evident and noisy and it slumped into the middle. Went to reception and was allocated another room (601?) - same problem - though not as bad. Went to reception, allocated 608 this time - guess what? Yep. So back to reception for the fourth time and given 611. Finally one that seemed okay (in relation ot the others) so I took the room. I say room because like all the others I was offered they were tiny - about 2 foot wider than the single bed and 5 foot longer? More a dorm. Okay its a travelodge but as I say, I stay at many budget hotels and never before have I seen rooms as small as these, especially when the cost was 105. Back to 611. Tried to get sleep - very poor night - the matttress slumped to the mddle (though not as much as the others) and I tossed and turned most of the night - got about 1 hour at a time. Result - one very tired and irritable guest. Breakfast didnt help - again, you have limited expectations as its a budget hotel but this was bad. cold, anaemic , watery scrambled eggs, cold overcooked bacon, overcooked and thus rubbery sausages. You get the idea.IF this was a Premier Inn, I wouldnt have had a problem with gettign a refund under their guarranteed good nights sleep, In this case I started with the website - no help. Every time I submitted a complaint the website went down and I lost my commentary (I did however remember to copy it before pressing submit the second time). No, it wasnt my machine as all the other net functions I was running were fine. Then tried to phone. Followed all the options and ended up with someone who, after I explained the situation, said &quot;This is booking, I cant help you.&quot; So having asked for complaints telephone no I get &quot;Sorry sir this is Barcelona I dont have that&quot;. Eventually used contacts to phone the press office and the communications director's office to get the phone no for complaints - boy do they ever like to make it hard. I must admit that when speaking to the Press Office, the phrase Barcelona and Fawlty Towers came out. The complaints person was told the story and how, had I not paid over the net, would have refused to pay for the room. Was told it would be investigated. Oh joy, an email arrived later from the manager of the Marylebone saying that yes there ws a problem with the mattress in one room but not the others. That is it. No apology, no offer of refund or compensation - pathetic. As I said, I use Travelodge and the others a lot. Never had to complain before and always had a good/acceptable (what do you want from a budget hotel eh?) stay and never had to compain. Following this disaster, especially the attrocious customer services experience, I will be giviing preference to Premier Inn and Travelodge will be lower down the list. Yes, sometimes things go wrong. Treat a compaining customer correctly and you will keep them or get praise from them for hwo you handled it. If you bodge that then you alienate customers and get bad PR."
15,1311,"Sep 11 2009 	Great for Wembley Ideal for London	Stayed here for the U2 concert, turn right out of Marylebone station ( which is nice and quiet ) and it's only 100 yds away. Stayed on the 2nd floor overlooking the main street and didn't hear any traffic ( and I sleep light ). Arrived 11.30 am and paid 10 extra for an early room, reception said to come back 12.30pm. We walked 15 minutes to Regents Park, ate a picnic and returned to drop our stuff off. Although it's by the station, it's a very quiet part of London, yet only a slow 10 min walk from Tussauds. Didn't eat here so cannot comment. Staff we had contact with were nice and friendly. Room was fine, bed was comfy and flat screen telly on wall ( it's a travelodge, people, NOT the ritz ). In the station there is a good sports bar, m&amp;s food place, burger king, paul ( a french patisserie ) and a cornish pasty stall. Also a couple of coffee bars. As it's on the Bakerloo line, connections are great. Charring Cross ( for Trafalgar Sq ) Embankment ( Tate Modern, London Eye ) Piccadilly Circus and Wembley Central. Chiltern railways run trains from Wembley to Marylebone with no stops, so within half an hour of the concert finishing we were back at the hotel ( I'm getting old ). I don't really want to recommend this place, because it may be booked up next time we want to stay. All in all, a great base for exploring London"
16,1311,Sep 11 2009 	Great location and clean rooms	Would go back to this Travelodge. It's right beside a train and tube station with all the connections you need for shopping and nights out in London. It is very clean and rooms are a good size. The beds are comfortable. Breakfast is a bit dodgy but you can eat well in the station.
17,1311,"Sep 11 2009 	SLEEPLESS IN LONDON	We decided to stay in london for the night after going to see england v croatia so we decided to stay at travelogde in marylebone.The location is excellent right next to marylebone tube station an 2 stops from oxford circus.We arrived at 2.45 pm and was greeted at reception and we wes given our key to our room which was on the 3rd floor.The room smelt fresh and clean and there was not a fault i could complain about the room untill night time...if you are a light sleeper like me then you will not get a wink of sleep,being right ne to the tube you hve all the comings and going of the taxi rank which was right outside our room at some stages of the night i thought i was on a rally excursion all we heard all night was boy racers and how loud there exhausts were and how fast they could go but apart from that no fault on the hotel side very clean and good location.We paid for a breakfast which was 5.00 each acs we booked online and got a discount,but i would say eat breakfast out the english brekky was not that nice for what you pay and there are lots of places to eat which are only 5 mins away."
18,1311,"Sep 6 2009 	Great location for transport and the West End	My girlfriend and I stayed for 3 nights in June. The room was ok, it was clean and big enough. The location was excellent, Marylebone railway station was right opposite the hotel. A bus stop to get the bus into the West End was a few minutes walk away.The breakfast was good, plenty of choice. You could have a cooked breakfast or cereals if you wanted.The only bad thing I would say about the hotel is they lack irons! This is not the first time I have experienced this in Travelodge hotels. I would advise guests to take a travel iron with them. Apart from that it is a good hotel. Would definately stay there again."
19,1311,"Sep 1 2009 	Pleasant hotel easy access into City	We stayed 5 nights in this Travelodge and found it very pleasant .When we arrived the receptionist was very thorough and helpful, we pre booked at 53 a night plus 6 pppn for breakfast and evening meal ,our bed was comfortable with a bath toilet and basin . We were on the 4th floor right next to the lift the hotel was full but we heard no noise all night ,except from outside from the traffic .The location was great with the tube only 100yards and the Bakerloo line 10 minute walk away .Our first night was hot as there is no aircon but we asked the staff and they gave us sheets to use instead of the duvet . Breakfast was good with all you can eat cereal english breakfast toast and muffins .The evening meals were poor and not worth buying .Our experiencse was the menu was limited and what they did have half was not available When we brought this to the managers attention he gave us 5 nights refund of 60 which we then used at Weatherspoons on Baker Street 10minutes walk away ,this did not ruin our stay as the outcome was to our liking .Overall i would recommend this Travelodge we shall be returning to use it again ."
20,1311,"Sep 1 2009 	Great Value for the money! Great location! Great breakfest!	Me and my girlfriend really liked this hotel.Great location(half a minute walk from the tube), 2 minutes walk from tesco,5 minutes walk from baker street.Clean room with an LCD.Nice breakfest(all you can eat).Great value for the money we paid."
21,1311,"Aug 31 2009 	Great Location poor poor management	This particular Travelodge has a first rate location - just outside the Marylebone Station and right around the corner from the #453 and #2 Marylebone bus stops. The area is busy and seemed safe to us. We had no problems getting from the Piccadilly Circus Tube Station (after taking the Tube from Heathrow) to Marylebone on a bus - #453. There is a great little M&amp;S store in the station for snacks and sandwiches. The Cornish pasties in the little booth in the station are great and inexpensive. Forget about finding a place to park a car. I didn't see any parking places. Now the bad news. We stayed here 5 nights. The first 2 nights were on beds that were probably 10 years old. Hard and lumpy. Housekeeping had no idea that there were actually 2 people staying in a room with twin beds and left only towels for 1 person even after we complained. No cups or spoons. Missing TV control. Tea or coffee for 1 person. There also must be a severe soap shortage in the Travelodge chain. We got one bar which was the smallest bar of hotel soap I have ever seen. Very annoying. Plan on asking for extra towels and soap every day. The manager gets paid by the number of soap bars he gives out. As usual with Travelodge internet access costs a fortune, but they do have decent 1 GBP per 20 minutes machines in the lobby.We got moved to another room with better beds and further from the street the last three nights we were there. The towel problem followed us to the new room on the fourth floor. Street noise could be a problem on the first couple of floors if you are super sensitive. The windows block a lot of the noise out and the walls are not paper thin or else we had very quiet neighbors.The folks in reception were always polite and ready to help. No problems there. Cleanliness was acceptable. We deemed the food prices in the restaurant to be too high and not a good value. The food looked good and there was plenty of it even late in the morning the one time we went through the area.I would recommend this hotel based on its wonderful location. Its housekeeping is so poorly trained and managed it would be hard to recommend it otherwise."
22,1311,"Aug 2 2009 	Avoid lower floors as tube is closeby. Not bad for money 	Our party was 2 adults and 3 teenagers, and we had 3 rooms over 3 nights. The staff were pretty friendly, and they were quite helpful, but there was a language barrier with several staff, who did not have English as a first language. So it was a bit of a struggle to communicate at times...The one room we were given (108) was very noisy at night, as it was right opposite the tube and also directly above the delivery bay, so it was very noisy at 5am; and we had actually phoned a few days before to request the top floor for ALL rooms, and the guy said he would put that request in.... And yet, we were put on the first floor, and told we could not have the top floor now, as 'the top floor is full..,' (Yet we were told that it would be fine to have top floor, when we phoned a few days earlier.) So this annoyed us a bit. - especially after ending up with a room right above the delivery bay. So there seemed to be a lack of communication there, or the person who said we 'could' have the top floor, could not understand us fully, or he did not make a proper note of it... So if you are staying, try and ensure you are put on a high floor... and if you request a higher floor, make sure you DOUBLE check on the morning of the afternoon you are due to check in.On the third day there, most of the stuff was not avaliable on breakfast, and we had to keep waiting for toast, sausages, plates, knives, milk, and cups; and the stuff we 'did' have was cool by the time the other stuff came. But when the breakfast IS all there, it's good value, as you can eat as muich as you like, of sausage, bacon, eggs, toast, cereal, yoghurts and fruit muffins; and you can drink as much juice and tea and coffee as you like too. Also, children under 16 eat free, so make sure you mention that when paying for your breakfast... 4 big breakfasts including drinks, for 15 in total, for 2 adults and 3 teenagers is worth the money. We ate at 10am, and didn't have to eat again til tea time!When we came for a meal on the first night, (in the bar,) some of the items on the menu were not available... we have had this at several Travelodges now, so they need to get their supplies in order here. AND in 2 of the rooms (112 and 108 I think;) the safety catch was missing from the window, so it could be opened fully. so this needs fixing.., As soon as you check in (especially if you are with children/teenagers,) check the safety catches, as it could mean the difference between life and death. If your window does not have one, ask to be moved to a room that DOES have one...Not overly happy with some things, but not overly unhappy as the staff were very nice and gave us anything we needed. Overall, the stay was just average; not dreadful, but not brilliant.. Must emphasise though, that none of it was the fault of the staff, and they were very nice, and the cleaning staff were very efficient and thorough. Basically for the money, it's worth it... but it is not brilliant. Very handy for tube and rail though.I probably would be more likely to reccommend the Covent Garden one than this one, as it is very close to tube and the west end (Leicester square and Oxford street etc,) and the rooms were better, it was less noisy, we got the floor we wanted, everyone understood us, and the food was always available and I could not find any faults... So I would have to say no to actually recommending the Marylebone one... as there are several others which are much better.. However, it wasnt AWFUL and for the money it was 'OK.'... If there were no other places available, I would stay again, but I would be more likely to look for rooms at the Covent Garden one. Even the Kings Cross Royal Scot one as really nice and well supplied with food and with a friendly atmospheric bar, but it's 15 minutes walk from the tube... that is the only fault with that one.... The best thing about the Marylebone one is it is 2 minutes walk from the tube and the railway station...And the staff were very friendly. It's OK, but would not be my first choice again."
23,1311,Jul 21 2009 	Comfortable stay 	Stayed one night in a single room. Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom had a large bath which was great to have a soak in. Other than that it was just what I wanted for 1 nights stay in London and at a price of 30 for a Sunday night was good value.It is situated right next to Marylebone Station and yet is in a relatively quiet location. Access to central london is easy via the tube.The only down side was that there was no kettle in my room but once mentioned to reception this was immediately rectified.If you are looking for a clean and comfortable hotel in London at a reasonable price I would recommend this hotel.
24,1311,"Jul 6 2009 	too hot too noisy checked out without staying	Only 1 positive. Good location for tube station. Too many negatives. Nearest car park 40 for 5 hours -24 hours. No air conditioning - far too hot and noisy, we checked out without even staying as it wasn't worth staying for a rubbish night sleep so drove home. The bathroom was VERY dated and needed ripping out. If I had stayed, I wouldn't have wanted to even use it. I think the other reviews must have been dreaming...."
25,1311,"Jun 21 2009 	Lots of good points and one bad one!	Good location, large clean rooms, small bathrooms but a bath, shower, toilet and sink so what more do you want. Beds were comfy and hotel was right next to Marylebone station. Breakfast was plentiful, cereal, bread, muffins, pastries, tea, coffee, juice and hot english choices like scrambled egg, sausage bacon etc. However you can get a cheaper breakfast at the station or at a cafe a two minute walk past the station called Egg and Bacon. BE WARNED, we asked three times for an iron and they didnt have one so invest 10 in a travel iron and take one with you. Overall an enjoyable stay in a good location. The 453 bus goes from the station to Oxford Circus, Trafalgar Square so a handy bus if you dont want to use the tube."
26,1311,"Jun 20 2009 	Roomy comfy 	Located just next to Marylebone Rail/Tube Station, or a 10mins walk to Baker Street Station, getting anywhere is just easy. I booked my rooms early and got it at 49 pounds a night, but I believe rates can go to even lower to 9 pounds if you book it really really early, like 5mths before?! Nice cafe just round the corner (opp. Marylebone Station) that serves very good breakfast for about 4 quid. Prefer the bus? Hop on to bus service 453 which is also in the same area which brings you straight to Oxford Circus/Piccadilly Circus in about 15-20min, depending on traffic conditions. Marylebone Station is also where you take the rail (45min ride) to Bicester Village where designer brands are sold at knock-off prices - great location for the fashionista! All in all, I would definitely choose this hotel if I return to London again!"
27,1311,"May 26 2009 	Unwelcoming uninviting cold - I won't be going back	The building was conveniently close to the station, but the welcome was poor. The receptionist preferred to write in his book rather than acknowledge me as I stood waiting. The room was cold as there was no central heating on because it was summer! No matter that English summer is unpredictable and this evening was cold. I slept well - the bed was very comfortable. The room was grubby in the corners, and the window runners filthy, but overall room cleaniness was ok. The bathroom basin plug was broken and unable to stay down. The light above the mirror had a hidden switch which I never did find. There were no toiletries other than one small bar of soap. Breakfast was a plentiful buffet, with a good selection, and pleasant bright surroundings. But again, no welcome. I was ignored by the two suited employees when entering. The first sign of civility was when the waitress approached, but all she did was ask for was the breakfast voucher - without any hint of a smile let alone a &quot;Good morning&quot;. Some lessons in customer care needed here."
28,1311,"May 8 2009 	Jesus ... you get what you pay for ..!!	First the good points. Good central location, near the West End sights and very cheap. We booked a few months in advance and managed to get 3 double rooms for 30.00 per room.Now the bad ...Check in time is an unflexible 3pm. We turned up at 2.40pm and were told we could check in only if we paid a 10 supplement per room. They provide no facilities for storing luggage. We had a drink in the bar in the railway station and checked in at 3.05pm.The rooms are shabby, cracked tiles in the bathroom, peeling paint and wallpaper in the bedroom etc. Overnight the road noise was unbelievable. I once slept on the roof of a hotel in central Athens and heard less noise. How a hotel in a city centre can exist without double glazing (or even windows which are the same size and shape as the window frames in which they sit !) is beyond me.Another two plus points. The bed was large and comfy and the breakfast would have been extremely good value at 7.50 per head, had the hot buffet been hot. Instead you piled your plate with luke-warm sausage, bacon and scrambled egg before a very attentive (credit where it's due) took it into the kitchen to be micro-waved.If you can book in advance and you're used to roughing it then this is the place for you. If you get quoted anything over 60.00 for the room look elsewhere. There are numerous budget hotels which will offer better value for money than this place.."
29,1311,"Apr 23 2009 	Excellent hotel with a fantastic location.	I stayed here for 11 nights in July a couple of years ago and I absolutely loved it. The location is lovely because of: proximity to tube station, safety of area, off license down the street and all of the awesome food places inside the Marylebone station. The staff was great, they helped me with directions and anything else I needed. The breakfast was good, minus the fellow countrymen acting like jerks towards the staff. Good thing I wasn't with them. Overall, I would recommend staying here if possible."
30,1311,"Apr 13 2009 	Ideal for an overnight stay	Good location and a clean. comfortable room which looked as if it had recently been done up. Nothing to complain about, and great value."
31,1311,Apr 5 2009 	I was very surprised with the negative reviews - I thought it was great!	I stayed at this hotel recently and I was very pleased with nearly everything. The location for starters is ideal - opposite Marylebone station where a good range of food is available. Simply Food at M&amp;S was really useful. We got a good welcome at reception. I was really suprised to see all the negative reviews - we had a small problem regarding the plumbing in the bathroom but other than that I had no complaints at all.The beds looked new and there was a fresh feeling in the room. We heard a lot of traffic all through the night but I had no reason to complain - after all I do not go to London expecting it to be silent! There was no problem regarding cleanliness in the room or throughout the hotel. I would fully recommend this hotel .
32,1311,"Mar 24 2009 	Fine for a City Break	The hotel is just in the final throes of being refurbished at the moment, with new carpet being laid in the hallways. Its not a complete refurbishment - we had new beds, and new TV in the newly painted room - in the bathroom it was the original suite with new taps. The shower worked well though and there was plenty of hot water.The hotel is well located and we had not problem with street noise. Marylebone station is right across the road and has a M&amp;S which we used for snacks and breakfasts. There is no left luggage facility at the hotel or at Marylebone station,. You have to go to either Paddington or Euston stations. As long as you are looking for hotel that you leave in the morning and then came to at night to sleep, this will suit you fine."
33,1311,Mar 14 2009 	Very poor and overpriced for what it is.	For 92 I had an absolutely tiny room that was dismal and uncomfortable.The shower cubicle was so small you could hardly move.The sink was so small that I couldn't fill the kettle from the tap.When I asked for a shampoo satchet I was told that was extra cost.The whole hotel felt dingy and seedy.It was perhaps better than sleeping on a park bench but even that would be questionable in summer.
34,1311,"Feb 9 2009 	Run down basic and shabby!	I expected Travelodge properties to be maintained to an acceptable standard...this one certainly was not!!The wooden shelves, bath sides and toilet tank were made of dark mahogany wood and warped really badly. Paint was flaking of the walls.The excuse for lack of towels, pillows and toilet roll was to 'save the environment'. They don't economise on price, so why limit the basics?No parking and difficult to find if you're taking the car.Good for public transport - near to Marylbone station and taxi ranks.On the whole: average."
35,1311,"Feb 1 2009 	Never Again	Went in Dec 2008, the hotel is an old Ramada hotel that Travelodge have bought and put their name on it, first room we had was mouldy and smelt, we were moved to the third floor, no lamp shades on wallights in corridor and a few &quot;fist&quot; indentations in the walls.second room had no heating and the shower head kept falling off and again mouldy and smelt, had to stay because we had no were else to go.Must be the only hotel were i have never had a shower in the morning because i felt everything was dirty, we did compalin and were given a free breakfast.This was served by the man who we had just seen cleaning and the lobby, it was cold and tasted funny.The staff were very apologetic about the state saying that it was going to be refurbed in 2009 starting on the lower floors first, so if you do need to stay there ask if any refurbs have been done first otherwise give it wide berth."
36,1311,"Jan 21 2009 	Substandard	We used this hotel for a night's stay so that we could catch a train early the next day.We use the Travelodge chain quite frequently because they are usually such good value for money. On this occasion we were disappointed. The weather was freezing outside and the windows were only single glazed and there was a lot of condensation. Also it was very noisy near the station, even on the 5th floor. There was a lot of mould on the bathroom blind and we did not like the look of the shower. It looked tatty and needed replacing.The bed was comfortable though and the linen was fresh and clean but we had only one bathtowel between us. The TV was very nice and modern. Since the key-cards were not functioning throughout the hotel, every time we went out we had to ask a member of staff to let us back in. They were very pleasant about it but it made unnecessary work for them. They expected this to be rectified in the New Year. One of the two lifts was out of order.The breakfast was not very special. The food was not hot enough and the toaster didn't pop up properly and the bread caught fire if we didn't take it out ourselves. Rather dangerous we thought.It is very convenient for Marylebone Station but unless it has a major make-over, we would not consider staying there again."
37,1311,"Jan 14 2009	Great value for money	Having read reviews before arriving we thought the hotel was going to be awful, much to our relief it turned out to be brilliant value for money. We had a twin room on the 4th floor, (booked early and paying 43 a night B&amp;B). The room was a decent size and clean. Beds clean. Yes, it needs redecorating. Again the bathroom was clean, however the taps very, very tarnished, couple of chips on bath, it is tired and needs refurbishing, but everything worked and to repeat, everything was clean."
38,1311,Jan 5 2009 	Tatty and Run Down	I booked Travelodge based on good experiences at other Travelodges but sadly this hotel is tatty and quite run down. I don't think it has been decorated in 20 years and the room I had was not very clean. The only good thing about this hotel was the staff.
39,1311,"Jan 4 2009 	At 19 per room per night it was good.	I booked this Travlelodge as I wanted somewhere in central London during the (Xmas sales) time between Christmas and New Year, but did not want to pay high prices.I travelled from Swansea at 8.30am and arrived in Paddington at 11.45am. As the room was so cheap, I had booked an early check in, and so was able to drop my luggage off at 12 midday and hit the sales straight away!! Oh yes, and see the Xmas lights and see the sights etc!I arrived at the Travelodge with my Son and checked in with no problems. The staff were very friendly but the Card - Key machine had broken, and remained so during our two night stay, so we had to be taken to our room by a member of staff each time we wanted to go in. However, this was never a problem, as there was always someone available to do this. I was allocated a decent sized twin room, which was clean and spacious. The windows on the bathroom were very old aluminium double glazing and did look shabby, but were hidden behind the big curtains. However, they did allow some traffic noise, which woke me up from around 6am both mornings. (I am a very light sleeper, and my son heard nothing)The bathroom was small but clean, although the grout was stained black around the bath. The shower was very good.The room was lovely and warm, as it had a large radiator which was turned up full. (You could control the temperature of the radiator, but after being out all day in December up full was lovely!) Loads of tea and coffee etc in the room, and this was replenished when the room was cleaned.The breakfast was an eat all you want hot and cold buffet affair and was really good. The breakfast room was a little small, but we got a table with no trouble. Breakfast cost 7.50, but children under sixteen eat free, which was great news for me, and even better news for my son, who is nearly fifteen and 5'10! As stated in previous reviews, the location is really very convenient. This was the kind of trip where you left the hotel in the morning, and did not get back until very late, so little time was spent in the room anyway.All in all, although I would not be happy to pay 90 per person per night for this place, this was a decent, clean room, with good beds and a good shower, conveniently located in central London for 19 per room. The staff were all very friendly and professional. For the price, it was very good value."
40,1311,"Dec 27 2008 	Slightly run-down but dirt cheap	Very handily located about 100yds from Marylebone Station. Room was tiny, I'd inadvertantly booked a single - no room to swing a cat, but adequate. Was turned away from the hotel as I'd arrived at 1.30 and checkin was at 3.00 (normally they'll allow you to check-in early, but maybe my room wasn't available).The shower seemed a bit grotty (dirty grouting and cracked tiles) but did the job.I'm not complaining, as it was only 9 a night - as I'd booked it direct, taking advantage of one of Travelodge's regular &quot;book 3 months in advance&quot; promotions."
41,1311,"Dec 15 2008 	ok for 29 per night	We needed a bed for the night near Marylebone station after going to an event at the O2, and 29 was a bargain.The double room was a decent size, although layout did not make best use of it (lots of unused space, yet if you needed to use the mirror and sit in the overly large chair no-one could get past!). The room was worn - broken lightshade, cracked tiles, but clean enough, and in a decent area.For 29 I don't think you'll get any better in Central London! However I wouldn't pay 80."
42,1311,"Dec 13 2008 	Worst Travelodge I have stayed in	OK it was partly the time of year which meant that I had to pay over 90 for a single room with no breakfast included but that does not excuse all the other shortcomings. The room was far from generous in size compared to the usual travelodge room. It was in serious need of care, it was shabby, needed a good clean and a good paint. The furniture looked like rejects from other rooms and just did not seem as clean as it should be. The bathroom also needed a lot of attention as the shower did not work properly and it all needed a deep clean, fittings needed repair as well. This place really was a disappointment and has seriously damaged my confidence in the Travelodge brand. On balance I think that my mark of 2 for this place is a little over generous."
43,1311,"Dec 12 2008 	Best bed in London for 29	This Travelodge is definitely one of the better hotels in the chain.Situated about a 30 second walk from Marylebone tube station, it is very easy to find. There is a Marks and Spencers inside the station which is very handy although a tad pricy but hey it's London.The staff were very friendly throughout and attentative.The room was on the first floor and we were very impressed for 29 a night! The bed was suprisingly comfy, the bathroom had seen better days but I'm not complaining at all. It was clean and smelt nice, and there was plenty of space to hang clothes and dump shopping.One small problem is that the walls are quite thin so if you have loud neighbours (which always seems to happen to me!) then you'll have to bear with it until you sleep.All in all I was very impressed and wouldn't hesitate to go back here, nothing fancy just a good comfy clean bed and a nice hot shower!"
44,1311,"Nov 24 2008 	Really scruffy	Standard Travelodge, the room was a good size and location good but it looks like it needed refurbishing a few years ago. In the entrance lobby the carpets are stained, you pass up the stairs past the out of order lift you notice the paint kicked off the doors. The walls are marked with the paper damaged. The radiator covers are broken. In the room the carpet is stained, paint is damaged, sealant around the bath is cracked and broken, the wooden surround around the light over the washbasin is hanging loose.Hotel prices in central London are outrageous during the week so 92 for this location didn't seem to bad to me until I stepped inside and found what a dump it was."
45,1311,Oct 17 2008 	Great hotel clean and good location	I have just stayed at this hotel for a long weekend. It is very nice and up tpo usual travelodge standards. Staff are friendly and helpful. room is a decent size you get a table with a big mirror and an lcd tv with freeview. The bathroom is a little bit small but doesent cause a problem. The beds are comfy and linen was in good condition. One thing to watch tho if you are staying more than 1 night and you want a fresh towel the cleaners dont change them even if there on the floor like it states i had to ask for new towels but the reception just give you them no problems. Its in a great location just 2 min walk to marylebone train station so easy to get the tube to were you want to be. We also went for a night out and was easy enough to get the night bus back to hotel it drops you of at baker street 5 minutes round the corner. I would recomend this hotel to my friends but i would say dont go expecting 5* luxury at travelodge its basic and thats what you get. Overall for 100 for 2 nights in central london bargin!
46,1311,Oct 8 2008 	Good place for a jolly	Just stayed here the one night for a gig in London.(Jimmy Barnes). Right beside train/tube station which is handy &amp; it's pretty cheap. 40 for a double/twin. Bathroom could do with a few tiles replaced but other than that it's clean &amp; comfortable. Good spot if you are away with the lads.
47,1311,Sep 8 2008 	Great location no frills hotel.	Reception staff were very helpful on check in.Twin room on 5th floor. Shabby bathroom and decor but the room was very clean and the bed comfortable. The hotel is located next to Marylebone train / tube station and is very well placed for public transport. Didn't eat at the hotel so unable to comment of food.Not as good as the rooms in other travelodges I have visited around the country but at 49 per night in central London it is a good no frills option. Perfect if you just want a place to sleep! I would be happy to stay here again as the location is so good.
48,1311,"Aug 31 2008 	Good location	Good size bedroom but the bathroom is so small! Not a lot of restaurants/cafes nearby but few steps away from the Marylebone railway &amp; tube station (Bakerloo line).Book here if you're in a tight budget and only if you can get a discounted rate (around 59). For a 59, it is a lot better and cleaner in comparison to other hotels/B&amp;b of the same price."
49,1311,"Aug 3 2008 	Serves its purpose	Having read some of the other reviews, I came to the conclusion that either they were for the wrong hotel or I got very lucky.I stay in Travelodges regularly for business purposes and am quite happy with their no frills approach. I tried the likes of EasyHotel and they are just to basic so Travelodges are one step up.The location is very handy being next door to Marylebone Station.I was allocated a single room on the top floor so noise was minimal, the room was a little hot but there was a fan and a door onto a balcony which opened a reasonable amount to permit air through.The room was small (I've been in and seen smaller!) but enough for what I need - reminded me of many of the rooms you see in places like The Netherlands and Austria.The bathroom was fine except the shower pressure was a bit hit and miss - I eventually worked out that if the room next door was also taking a shower it vastly reduced your pressure.In terms of cleanliness, couldn't fault it.The breakfast was fine, no issues there.I think the point you must remember with the Travelodge brand is you are paying low prices for premium locations, it would defeat the object to increase the facilities and have to increase the cost. People always complain about not having this and that but this is always mentioned to you on the website when you book."
50,1311,"Jul 26 2008 	Awful - spend your money elsewhere	I stayed here recently for work having stayed in other Travel Lodges that are good value for money. It was awful! If I wasn't so tired I would have checked out and gone somewhere else.The room was so small I could hardly get dressed without bumping into bed or table. Shower room and bedroom were just filthy - like a room that hasn't been cleaned for months. Mould in the shower, hairs in the tray - yuk! I didn't want to put my feet on the floor or touch anything. Staff on reception not trained to deal with this sort of thing - felt sorry for them as obviously didn't know how to respond except to say 'other people like it'."
51,1311,"Jul 23 2008	This is soooo bad!!!	The only good thing about this hotel was the location. Spend a bit more &amp; don't stay here. We thought you couldn't go wrong with a Travelodge.....boy were we wrong. On entering the hotel, there is brown patches on the ceiling &amp; the hand rail is swinging in the wind. The reception is a sort of hatch with a grubby bench in it. I felt so sorry for the staff, they know how bad it is. After going to our room, I asked to see another as the desk was hanging off the wall, the bathroom was mouldy, so were the curtains. I was given three cards to different rooms. They are all the same....very small, very shabby &amp; very dirty. What ever you do, don't lift the sheets off the mattress, or the mattress off the bed frame, yuk. In the end I settled for a room, as I was losing the will to live. Should have looked better, as there was a hole the size of a football in the bathroom ceiling, with lots of thick black mould around it...lovely. A nice piece of someone elses chewing gum next to the bin just topped it all. Many thanks Travelodge.xxxx"
52,1311,"Jul 13 2008 	Hot hot hot	The room was a twin over looking Marylebone underground station. Excellent location (especially for Lords Cricket Ground) Excellent value, breakfast was nice and woth the 7.50 however the bed room was far too hot and made it difficult to sleep which spoilt the stay which was a shame."
53,1311,Jun 24 2008 	Good location fair price.	Single room was very small but clean and well decorated. Good location right by the station and near to Baker Street. Would recommend.
54,1311,"Jun 23 2008 	Small small small	It's been said before but I'll say it again, the single rooms are small! I had to close my suitcase to make enough room to open the door to get out. The bathroom is a wet room with shower. Mine filled the whole bathroom up with water which did not drain away for some time.The rooms are scruffy, the only plus point was a nice tv. I guess the location is convenient, but don't pay full price, it's really not worth it."
55,1311,"Jun 5 2008 	Agree with Other Reviews!	It is always difficult to review a hotel when your own experience is often focused on the particular accommodation or room you stay in.We were given a first floor room looking directly towards Marylebone station. Good view! But...It was not a warm day (about 18 deg C), but the room was baking. Windows had restrictors for safety, which restricted air movement. Fan provided, but was very sick! Naturally, no air conditioning. Having the windows open had the negative effect of noise - late night revellers, emergency service sirens, early moring rush and bin men. Not a good nights rest.The en-suite was similar with a shower that showered everything, making it a very &quot;wet&quot; room!!The bedroom was VERY tired, indeed close to being a refusal to stay. We did not stay in the hotel for food - there are some good places nearby towards Oxford Street.The location of this hotel is very good, but seriously let down by its poor condition. Not recommended until refurbed."
56,1311,"Jun 1 2008 	The bones of a little gem are there shame about the skin...	We actually stayed in this hotel about 4 years ago when it was a Ramada Jarvis, so we knew that the location was excellent, and our first stay was very positive. We booked a room at 49 per night (it was half term so rooms were no cheaper) which for London is a steal. The staff were really helpful and as said before the location is spot on, but the rooms have definitely gone down hill since our last trip. The rooms have been given a half hearted rebranding, but there are still the same old desks, the lift still has Ramada logos in, and the bathrooms are crying out for a refurb. The rooms have got very scruffy, and the whole hotel would benefit from a complete facelift.If this refurb took place, we would defintiely be regular guests. The loaction is fab, staff are attentive, and the breakkie cheap. But until it is smartened up, we won't be going back."
57,1311,"May 28 2008 	Good location but tired	I stayed here three times during April in 2008 because of its location (2 minutes' walk from Marylebone station) and price (I booked early so got the 19/night deal). This Travelodge used to be a Thistle hotel so it's actually got some character, unlike most other 'modern' Travelodges. But, like all other Travelodges, it doesn't seem to be maintained in any shape or form.My first two stays were in rooms facing the train station, or rather the busy road next to the station. The room had only single glazing, so was noisy. On my third and final stay I requested a quiet room (I had to do this in advance, apparently) and duly found I was facing a side street and had double glazing. So it was a bit quieter.The stay was fine for the money but as I say the rooms are tired and worn out - the bathrooms are minute (even by UK standards) and on my third stay the integral sink plug was stuck down.I didn't use the 'bar' but the M&amp;S in Marylebone station is open until about 10 or 11pm and sells alcohol as well as the usual food."
58,1311,"May 27 2008 	Good location great if you get a good rate.	Got a twin room here, staying bank holiday monday , 26th May, and booked well in advance on the travelodge website. Got the room for 29.Excellent value at that rate, but wouldn't want to be paying more than 50 per night for a hotel of this standard.Is basically a Ramada Jarvis hotel that has been bought by travelodge, but has not been refurbished.The rooms are at the end of their shelf life, bathrooms, windows etc are damp, and are extensively covered in mould.Beds etc clean, hotel directly opposite Marylebone station, so good rail and tube connections. Would stay here again if I could get a cheapo rate, but if you want something special for your london break, go elsewhere !"
59,1311,"May 21 2008 	Good Value 	This is a typical Travelodge &amp; if you can manage to book at the saver rate is extremely good value considering the location.It is right next to Marylebone station as well as on good tube &amp; bus routes.The area is pleasant &amp; as a solo female I had no qualms about returning at night.The members of staff at reception were polite and pleasant at all times. I didn't use the bar of restauarant so can't comment.The single room was tiny, but fine for a couple of nights. There was a shower room only which was also small but adequate. I was not aware of any noise either from the street or other guests and slept well The hotel is within easy walking distance of Baker St, Madam Tussauds &amp; Regents Park.The carpets &amp; soft furnishings are a little worn, but the place is clean."
60,1311,"Apr 8 2008 	Not As Described 	Travelodges in London are generally of a much lower standard that those in other towns and cities around the UK but this one was dreadful. The advertised Bar Cafe was not really available - they were serving drinks but no food. A rather embarrassed member of staff offered to send out for a pizza for me, but the result was (a) more expensive than the Travelodge advertised equivalent, and (b) so dreadful that I would probably have derived more nutritional benefit from eating the box it came in.I am also seriously concerned about the maintenance in London Travelodges. When I got stuck in a lift in one in February, I thought that was just a one-off. After spending half an hour stuck in my bathroom at this place because the door handle broke, I began to sense something of a pattern. In the end the Manager had to break the door down to free me.Worst of all I have been trying to contact their Customer Services people for 5 weeks now and no one ever responds.For a few pounds more you can have a much better, safer experience elsewhere. That's certainly what I will be doing in future!"
61,1311,"Mar 13 2008	Travel Lodge Marylebone	My wife and I regularly stay at this hotel because It is ideally placed for the work that she does in London. However this hotel is in need of serious refurbishment. Some rooms are in a very sorry state, especially the bathrooms. We have decided to change to another Travelodge nearby just to compare them. Paul Quest"
62,1311,"Jan 14 2008 	Best Customer Service Ever	It is true after reading the reviews,you don't know what to expect at Travelodge Marylebone.Upon check in the staff were great and helpful, the room do looked old but their English Breakfast Buffet is the best for just 7.50per person.I have stayed in many travelodge but Marylebone Customer service is the best by a mile.Steven Benoit"
63,1311,"Jan 6 2008 	Overall a good experience	Having read some of the reviews on this site I was quite unsure about staying in this hotel and contemplated cancelling my reservation. It is true to say that some of the criticism is justified. Our room was shabby and in need of decoration. The room was noisy due to the busy road outside. The facilities, as with all Travelodge hotels, are limited.However, there were also many good factors. We were able to book this room for just 19 through one of the offers run by Travelodge (a bargain for anywhere, let alone London). The location was excellent - literally opposite Marylebone station. The check in staff were friendly and efficient. The room though basic was clean. If you want luxury accommodation don't stay here - but get your chequebook out. If you want a good value base for a night or two in central London this may just be the hotel for you."
64,1311,"Dec 17 2007 	Needs Refurbishment	This hotel is badly in need of refurbishment. The extractor in the bathroom didn't work which probably accounted for the black mould all round the bath and tiling and the marks on the ceiling. The room had that tired, &quot;too many greasy take-away meals eaten here&quot; smell, chipped and marked furniture and marked paintwork. The shower fitting leaked, so when the bath was run, water came out of the shower head. The room was clean and fresh towels provided every day. On balance, this hotel should not rate any stars and I would not recommend it."
65,1311,"Dec 8 2007 	Disappointing - even by Travelodge standards	Good location, but shabby, shabby, shabby. Room and bathroom desperately neeed refurbishing. Room was noisy and overhot, with broken control on radiator and windows which wouldn't open. Bath stained.All you could eat breakfast, but food cold and gave impression of having sat around for some time despite turning up within 5 minutes of advertised start time. Coffee machine in dining room didn't work.Staff friendly."
66,1311,"Nov 29 2007 	Cheap as chips	I just needed a cheap overnight stay in London and managed to get a 26 Saver rate at the Travelodge Marylebone for a Sunday night (TOP TIP: the Travelodge website tends to have good availability for London on Sunday nights at the cheap rate - this is the third time I've booked) . The room was massive compared to others I've stayed in - it was a twin and there was plenty of room. Everything was clean and worked OK but there were a few dodgy bits where the attention to detail wasn't up to much (see pics). There wasn't anyone on reception when I arrived and after waiting for a while, I found someone in the downstairs bar who wasn't in any hurry to check me in. Didn't bother with breakfast.It's in a great location though - right next to Marylebone Station so dead easy to find and good connections. I walked from the hotel down to Baker Street, Marylebone High Street and Oxford Street and it's a pleasant walk so ideal if you want the shops/Madame Tussauds/etc."
67,1311,"Nov 3 2007	Always a Great Choice	This is our third time staying at Travelodge Marylebone. We love the location, just steps outside the tube/train station and our rooms have always been clean and comfortable. The traffic noise was somewhat more noticeable this time around, but definitely tolerable. We had a broken radiator, so the room was quite warm, but those type of minor inconviences are fine when only paying 26 pounds for the room. I'd definitely recommend this Travelodge in London."
68,1311,"Oct 31 2007 	Don't do it!!	Stayed as a last minute, had been warned that hotel was being refurbished but wasn't prepared for something loosely termed as a room. The heating was not working due to a radiator being broken, lights were missing, tiles damaged the sink was broken etc mould covering the walls in the bathroom. If it wasn't for the fact we couldn't get anywhere else we would have moved.... When we asked about heating we were given two blankets that looked like they were donations, unwashed and covered in stains looking mysteriously like blood. nice!"
69,1311,"Oct 30 2007	Great but don't book a single room	This is my preferred Travelodge when staying in central London. Although it is starting to look a little shabby and the bathrooms really need a refit it isn't as soulless as some of the other Travelodges I have stayed in and is good value for central London. The twin and double rooms are a good size and the bathrooms have baths rather than just a shower. However, don't book a single room here. My company travel agent had made the booking for my most recent stay and had only booked a single room. The room was extremely small, with barely any room to move, let alone space for luggage. These rooms should not be the same rate as the twin and double rooms. However, the reception staff were very helpful and I was able to switch to a twin room, but only smoking rooms were available. I would say this was a worthwhile compromise."
70,1311,"Oct 28 2007	Good location but needs a coat of paint!	I stayed here last week booked 2 rooms for the 26 rate on the travelodge website. I have stayed in a lot of Travelodges and this is my 3rd visit to Marylebone.Check in was easy at 3pm, very friendly helpful staff on reception. At first i was given room 310, and my friend has 313. 313 was fine but 310 was very damp - the window was dripping in condensation and the curtains felt damp, I went back to ask if another room was available and ended up in the room ive stayed in the past 2 visits 414 which is in a quieter location not overlooking the road.The bed was so comfy a really good matress! The room was clean, but the heater did not work. There was a spare pillow and bath sheet in the wardrobe space and nice flatscreen tv. The bathrooms are in need of re furbishment here - shower was fine but this hotel is looking scruffy now - peeling parer on walls in the corridors and scuffed woodwork/paintwork. Lots of mildew in the bathrooms but all Travelodge hotels are due a refit now.Its a great location - opposite Marylebone tube/station with Marks and Spencers food store open til 11.30pm, other good coffee shops and a soup/juice bar within the station and cafes nearby for cheap breakfast. I never eat in Travelodges as Im vegan so nothing id eat there!I had a very good nights sleep and would stay there again, the staff are very helpful and professional there, my friend had problems accessing her room and the manager and deputy were available straight away to help. As with all Travelodges no left luggage - we got the 205 bus to Euston to leave our bags, the museums have left luggage for 1 too.I find this a good basic hotel yes its scruffy but our rooms were clean and the 26 rate is very good!"
71,1311,"Oct 17 2007 	Shoehorned into the Travelodge	My wife and I stayed at the Marylebone Travelodge last night, each of us in a single (me in 116, her in 215). It's been said elsewhere but it bears repeating: the rooms are tiny: two steps in any direction and you're at a wall. Shoehorned into the room is a bed (smallish, with an OK mattress), a desk, a TV (8 channels only but flat screen) and a cupboard of sorts. The bathroom is tiny too. I'm six foot three so I felt like Gulliver. The outlook is the back alley. The towels were thin and a little damp, there was no shower mat and no soap, shampoo etc. This is minimalist lodging.I don't like the Travelodge very much, but I admire the management for getting 85 pounds a night for so little space, and amenities that feel shabby (except for the TV !). The doubles might be nicer, but were all taken as the price is supposedly the same for all room sizes.The hallways are tight, and there is an odor in the air which is hard to describe, but certainly is not pleasant.The staff were pleasant at check-in. Still, the desk cannot take a reservation for a future date (you have to go to the website or call), which seemed backward. I was also a little disturbed to notice that when I walked through the lobby (also tiny) at 9p.m. there was no-one at the desk. Anyone can just walk in and slip up the stairs unnoticed.Yes, the location is great: right next to Marylebone Station, and my room was relatively quiet (but I was on the back and wondering how I would get out of my room in a fire). Speaking of fire (alarms), mine went on for no obvious reason at 9 a.m., screeched twice (I was dressed and ready in seconds) and then...nothing. Got my day started early so that's a positive. No word from anyone at the desk as to what had gone down.I'll never stay there again. Not truly awful, but not spic and span enough, too small, and too smelly. It just goes to show that in the hotel business location alone is not everything."
72,1311,"Oct 10 2007 	The worst hotel ever	This hotel is by far the worst I've stayed at anywhere in the world.The bedroom was filthy, the furniture stained, the bathroom full of mildew, no extractor fan, no plugs in the sink/bath. The hallway and lift stank of damp. If I could have walked out I would have done. Never again."
73,1311,"Sep 25 2007 	Phone the decorators!	Travelodge has just announced that it plans 20,000 &quot;new look rooms&quot; by the 2012 Olympics and I hope that this hotel has been penciled in for an early overhaul. The location is excellent - just beside the station and is safe and quiet - but the hotel itself is a bit on the shabby side and is looking dated and tired. The general areas are just ok but the rooms and particularly the bathroom of the one I stayed in, need a complete upgrade. The bedroom was clean and spacious but the ceiling was stained from a leak. The bathroom fittings dated back to another era. Water temperature and pressure were fine but the taps looked ancient and worn. Somebody had done an amateur DIY sealant job around the bath and the bath itself was chipped. More dampness was evident above the wash-basin area. I don't think that any amount of cleaning would make this bathroom look good. On a more positive note the receptionist was very helpful and he allocated me a room at 10 AM which was several hours before the hotel's agreed check-in time. It was good not to have to haul luggage around until 3PM. Check-out was also efficient. I got a reduced roomrate of 49 per night as opposed to the usual 80. It is definitely not worth the full rate. The Travelodges Farringdon and particularly Holborn are far superior. In future I would opt for those or the 3 Night Weekend Rate at Ibis Euston (Convenient, spotless and excellent value). Roll on the refurbishment programme.Travelodge Marylebone needs it-and sooner rather than later."
74,1311,"Sep 23 2007 	Have stayed in better places.....	I stayed at this Travelodge for one night for work - being London Fashion Week pretty much everywhere else was overpriced so I managed to obtain a 'bargain' priced single room for 80... I have stayed at this hotel before with my husband and so felt quite happy to go back alone based on the fact that it has a very convenient location next to Marylebone station. Unfortunately that fact is about the only positive thing that I could say following this visit! I had a room on the first floor; there was an overpowering smell of air freshner which was trying to mask the damp smell pervading the floor. The carpet seemed wet so I'm not sure if they had had some sort of flood. Fortunately my room was dry - but it was one of the smallest rooms I have ever seen (I'm a hotel contractor so have seen quite a few!) - quite similar to a cell. The room was also dirty, the toilet broken and I couldn't bring myself to have a shower in the morning given that the fittings looked dirtier than I was (!) - and rustier.. All in all, I would say this hotel is a good choice only if you get one of the really cheap deals and don't expect a lot from it. It has a good location, but so do a lot of other hotels in London. Unless standards improve and the hotel offers clean, value for money accommodation, I certainly wouldn't choose to stay there again!"
75,1311,"Sep 22 2007 	Great if you like dead mice!	Hotel location is great, it is just across the street from the Marylebone tube station and about a five or so minute walk from the Baker St. line. The bar was nice and cozy and the all you can eat breakfast buffet is pretty well stocked with eggs, bacon, potatoes, yogurt, toast, fruit etc. etc. a pretty good way to start your day! If you can stay during the supersaver nights (26UKP) then I guess you could put up with the rusty fixtures, mold on the walls in the bathroom, a hard mattress, and I guess you could even put up with a dead mouse in your bathroom! I however, did not pay 26UKP I paid 49 UKP which adds up to $98 which is too much to pay for a room with a dead mouse in it! They were oh so kind (please note sarcasm!) and gave me 26UKP back! - I have since tried to contact them about this and they have refused to answer me. I guess all in all if you like rodents then go ahead and stay at this hotel  if however, like me, you dont particularly want to pay for a mouses room and board then maybe go and find a different hotel!"
76,1311,"Sep 18 2007 	Can't fault the location	the London Marylebone cannot be faulted for location! Checkin was smooth &amp; the receptionist pleasant. We booked 2 rooms - a twin &amp; a double.The double was adequate, though it was very disappointing to find that there was no lock on the bathroom door - there was evidence that there used to be a lock! The bed was a bit creaky but comfortable - the shower was good &amp; we had no traffic noise. The twin had the two beds pushed together - this was a little disappointing - the whole point of a twin room is two separate beds! We managed to pull them apart about 6 inches which improved things. The rest of the room was fine.We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, again preferrign the M&amp;S on the station!The rooms aren't large but for the one night we stayed it was absolutely fine. Again the location is GREAT!"
77,1311,"Sep 17 2007 	Absolutely fine would stay again.	Was a little worried about booking this hotel based on some earlier reviews, although the most recent ones (2007) seemed to be better. I'm glad we did, the room was what you would expect.... well it's just a hotel room, a little basic but it had a TV, tea &amp; coffee making facilities, a small wardrobe and a bath with shower. the bedding and bathroom were clean, the carpets and decor were fine and the lifts worked!We did have a small problem with an uncomfortable mattress on one of the beds in our twin room (dodgy springs). We asked for this to be changed which the staff said they would do, unfortunately when we returned we still had the same one, I spoke to someone at the front dest who apologised and moved us to another room with no fuss. Again this room was clean and tidy and the mattress was better!!In general the staff were also friendly and welcoming, similar to another reviewer we checked in at about 9.30am a good few hours early and the staff were most helpful, on checking out we asked about the luggage and were told that they didn't have this facility, some of the larger railway stations have this facility for a few pounds a day so it didn't really matter anyway.The location is absolutely A1, right across from the station/tube and easly walking distance to a few great places (Regents park, Tussauds etc.) Is short (too late eh!) when we come back to the city this is the first hotel I will check for price and availability, and I would definitely recommend this hotel for somewhere central and fairly cheap to stay in London."
78,1311,"Sep 16 2007	Great for the price	Stayed here with my mum for one night while we were in London seeing a show. Was a bit concerned by some of the reviews as my mum is a clean freak and I didn't want to end up in a dirty old room. However, apart from grubby taps in the bathroom the standard of cleanliness was fine. The fittings are worn but it looked like there were new floor and wall 'tiles' in the bathroom, the beds were comfy with nice white linen and the shower was hot and powerful. We only had brief contact with staff (checkin/out and on returning from theatre) but they were friendly and smiley. I don't know London at all so use the tube all the time and this Travleodge is 4 stops from Picadilly Circus - mega convenient. As far as road noise goes - er, yeah, the Travelodge is on a road in central London so there are cars driving past it, but er, yeah, the Travelodge is on a road in central London. We paid 26 - I would stay here again at that price and probably even at 39 or 49 rate."
79,1311,"Sep 13 2007 	Just about OK	My employer booked a room for me and was charged 106 pounds! I know that the booking was last minute and London was very busy - but this was a complete rip off! I was allocated a smoking room as there was nothing else available. The smell was quite unpleasant and, although a notice on the window said that it would only open to a limited extent (being on a high floor, I suppose) it did in fact open fully. This was fortunate as the room was desparately short of fresh air. The room itself was OK - but only just. It had definitely seen better days and all the furniture was dented or scraped or marked, as were the walls. The bed was quite comfortable - I have certainly slept in much worse. The room did not look very clean, but it was difficult to tell properly as everything was so old and worn. The bathroom was tiny and contained nothing but a small hard bar of soap. Some of the tiles round the bath were cracked, but it was reasonably clean. The shower (above the bath) was very ordinary, but the water was hot and the shower surprisingly powerful. There was no hairdryer in the room - fortunately I knew this was another Tripadvisor review. The corridors and lifts looked old and shabby. Breakfast was fine - juice, cereals, cooked breakfast, toast and tea/coffee. The hotel was well placed a stone's throw from Marylebone station and there was a good M&amp;S Simply Food at the station. I think the verdict is that if this had been a cheap rate (even though I didn't pay it myself) I would have been reasonably content. But for this price, it was a very bad deal. I wouldn't go back again."
80,1311,"Sep 9 2007 	Cheap basic hotel.	I stayed here with my best mate in September for a girlie shopping trip. We didnt expect the ritz but there were a few problems that the hotel really should have dealt with. Starting with the bad points about this hotel, the bathroom in room 304 wasnt very clean. The taps were stained and grubby looking and the shower curtain mouldy. The skirting board on the boarders of the room was coming off and could have been tripped over if we hadnt paid attention! The room was quite hot, no air con and because of the height of the building the windows had opening restrictions so we couldnt really get a lot of fresh air. Our main grumble with travelodge is that they DO NOT LET YOU STORE BAGS! They have no luggage room, which correct me if I'm wrong, a hotel should have! This is NOT mentioned anywhere on the website, we only found out through reading other reviews! You need to drop it off at the train station and pay for the priveledge. Other than that, the location is excellent, right across the road from Marylebone station. Generally helpful staff based on the minimal contact we had with them. Check in and check out was a breeze. I'd stay there again if I could get a 15 room rate or a 26 one."
81,1311,"Aug 26 2007 	Good for short stay	We wanted a cheap clean hotel with good location for our 2 night theatre break. This hotel is ideal. We got the 48 twin room deal from their website. Located 1 min from Marylebone underground station.Tea making in room, we bought our breakfast from M&amp;S also 1 min away.Staff were very friendly and helpful.Room clean,with plenty of room. We stayed in room 104 on the side street and the traffic noise was fine, even though we had the window open.Faults: No left luggage as mentioned before. We were lucky we arrived 12.30 and were allocated a room straight away.As our return journey was late evening, we had to get to King's cross after checkout, to leave our 2 cases there. This cost us 13 plus the tube fare, and took about 1 1/2 hours. There are only 2 people on the left luggage who were receiving, scanning, and also giving back luggage, so expect a queue!No air conditioning, windows do open though.Take a hairdryer, not provided."
82,1311,"Aug 23 2007 	Travelodge- our experience	Me and my partner stayed at the Marylebone Travelodge for 3 nights (August 2007). Check in is at 3pm but we arrived early at 10am in the hope of leaving our luggage there while we went out and about. The staff were welcoming and helpful and despite being there 5 hours before check in they allocated us a room which was ready for us. The location of the hotel was ideal for us being next to the station as we did a lot of travelling about on the tube, the only downside to being so near was the noise at night. It got quite hot in the room at times and i would have liked to keep the window open but it was far too noisy with people shouting and talking, the busy humdrum of the station, cars, buses and taxis.The room itself was very basic but with plenty of space. The cleanliness of the room was not as good as I would have liked but generally it was okay. The room had a good sized double bed, bedside tables, an open cupboard for clothes (not many hangers) and a table with a TV and tea/coffee making facilities. The wallpaper was peeling in places, the furniture is VERY old and in desperate need of replacing and the bed was pretty awful to be honest. The mattress was very lumpy and you could feel every spring in your back. The bathroom was a marginal improvement with good space and a fairly nice bath and shower. However, on our first morning there when we showered, there was no water coming out of the hot tap. My partner visited the front desk to complain and was told to wait 10 minutes for the air in the pipes to clear before trying again before they would change our room. Luckily, after 10 minutes the water started working again but this was not the first time we had this problem.The only other problem we had was on our departure date. We had been informed that we could leave our luggage at the hotel after check out (10am) in order for us to go and spend the day out before leaving. However, at the front desk we were told there was no where to keep luggage. This meant that we had to cancel our plans for the day and catch the train home straight away as our cases were too large to cart around all day so please be aware of this!We paid 26 a night which was a complete bargain comparred to how much we have spent on hotels in London in the past and for that amount we did not expect anything spectacular- you certainly get what you pay for. Overall, this hotel was okay for us as we spent very little time there. If you are looking for somewhere to just sleep and shower then it is fine but do not expect quality or much comfort. But at 26 a night you don't really expect much!"
83,1311,"Aug 23 2007 	A good Travelodge	This was a good, decent hotel in central London. Travelodge is just Travelodge, of course, easy budget accommodation with the basics: bed, en suite, TV, tea and coffee making facilities. This was excellently placed and nice and quiet considering how central it was. Keep clean and tidy and pleasant front desk staff. Good for those on a tight budget or wanting a one night stop over."
84,1311,"Aug 16 2007 	Great if you get one of their Saver Rates. But BEWARE no left luggage	Stayed for three nights and only paid 26 a night so this is an absolute bargain. Hotel is just outside Marylebone station and Baker St tube station(with a lot more lines) is a five minute walk away. I'd never really been in this neck of London and it's a nice mix of business and residential, traffic noise isn't too loud, it's even easliy walkable from Oxford Street. Good bus connections too from just outside the door. The hotel room was fairly standard three star business class hotel. A good size; a few scuff marks on the wallpaper where people had run their suitcases along the walls but otherwise very clean, good beds, extra pillows. The bathroom unfortunately was less impressive. Small, poor flush on the lavatory, shower fittings were quite rusty. But the shower did work well after we tightened the nut around the taps so the bath/shower selector worked correctly. We were in town to see some shows so we only spent time sleeping in the room. If you want a luxurious space to relax in, then look for another hotel. We had no meals at the hotel as there are lots of breakfast options at the station. However there were two major drawbacks with this hotel. One : no air conditioning. Our room faced due south so fortunately the weather was quite cloudy as otherwise it would have been unbearable. The window does open, which might be a problem if you have small children. It meant we could get some fresh air, but had the temperature been really hot outside it would have been almost impossible to sleep. Two : They refuse to hold bags for guests. We arrived on an early morning flight and were lucky that a room was available at 11a.m. But on our last day we had an evening flight and the receptionist said they didn't have any facilities to leave our bags. We had to drag them to the left luggage at Victoria Station. This is the first time I have ever come across this situation in a hotel and was quite angry about it as the website, of course, doesn't mention it. I now realise how lucky we were to have had an early check in. Would I go again. Not for the full room rate, no way. But at the saver rate definitely. And only with light bags!"
85,1311,"Aug 11 2007 	A Reasonable stop in London	The hotel was very easy to find as just outside the trainstation. Check in was very quick as had pre-paid. The corridors were quite small and a bit grotty. The room was comfortable, bed and bedding clean and the supply of a large fan was much appriciated as it was quite hot and not very well ventilated. The bathroom was a bit of a let down as there was mould on the windows and seemed dangerous as not double glazed and right over the bath. The shower curtain was way too long and easy to trip over. The loo seemed to not want to flush. We did have a hot shower though so that was fine. OK for a night but not much longer."
86,1311,"Jul 24 2007 	Nothing special	After reading alot of bad comments on this hotel, I was expecting this place to be awful. However it was not that bad really. The check-in went without hitch and was given a swipe card to allow access to our room. On arrival at the room I opened the door to find occupants still there. Luckily they were not upto anything! A quick word with the receptionist got us a new room. We were put in a room normally kept for disabled visitors but this meant a more roomier room. Bed was clean and bathroom was clean. Curtains and carpet were grubby. LCD TV, but couldent get any channels. A cooling fan was in the room which we were thankful for as it was a bit humid on our nights stay. The other guests did not have much respect for anyone else as there was constant banging of doors at all times of the night.Overall the hotel was ok. As we only paid 15 per room per night on a special Travelodge offer, we couldent really grumble much. I think I would stay there again but only for 15 per night again. I would not pay anymore than that for that hotel."
87,1311,"Jul 16 2007 	First and last visit	We'd never stayed in a Travelodge before, and I hope for their sake this one wasn't representative. It ought to have been so perfect, just a 30 second walk from the mainline railway station we arrive at. Stayed 2 nights, and it wasn't particularly cheap (99), probably because the Tour de France was in town eating up hotel rooms.Travelodge make much in their publicity of the idea that they can be cheaper by cutting out the fripperies like shower gel &amp; hairdryers. Fair enough, as we didn't intend to do anything there except use it to crash out after being out in London all day. They say that they concentrate instead on ensuring you get a clean and comfortable room so you get a good night's sleep.Well, this one offered neither. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable we've ever slept (or not) on, with pocket springs which went &quot;boing&quot; at even the slightest movement. Nor was the room particularly clean, with dust all over the chairs, scald-marks from the kettle all over the desk and shabby wallpaper where (presumably) a child's felt-pen scribblings had been painted over in a colour vaguely within the same spectrum. There was a peculiar smell out in the corridor - kind of frankfurters marinaded in bleach, so who knows what that was...Staff seemed like students passing through for a couple of days, and were completely indifferent to us. Maybe their uniform should be a t-shirt saying &quot;Whatever&quot;. OK, you don't expect an effusive farewell at the end of a stay, but a little more than a vague mumbling sound would have been nice.We didn't eat there; as others have recommended, we bought breakfast at the Marks &amp; Spencers branch on the station - a lot cheaper than the 7.50 Travelodge charge per person.Positives? The sound-proofing kept out street noise. The loo was clean, and the shower was OK. Er, that's it. I very much doubt we'll be going back..."
88,1311,"Jun 27 2007 	Not again!	I stayed at this hotel for the second time for 6 nights in mid June 2007. I had returned to the hotel because of the close proximity to both Baker Street and Marylebone tube stations. Once more I was in a single room on the top floor. Once more the room was quite tiny, though thankfully this time there was a proper shower. I did not eat at the hotel, and had no dealings with the staff. The bed was lumpy and the sheets were rather basic. I had to remake the bed on two occassions. I had had a niggling itch when I was at the hotel and it was only when I got home that I realised that I had been attacked by bed bugs! There are numerous bites all over my body!This hotel is not up to Travelodge standards! The single rooms are tiny whilst in most other Travelodges there is no difference between single travellers and couples. The rooms are even more basic than usual, and are in a general state of decline, as is the whole hotel. The money spent on plasma screens for each room would have been better spent on upgrading the rooms.Whilst this hotel should be commended on it's location I do not envisage me staying here again."
89,1311,"Jun 27 2007 	OK if you can get it cheap	As others have said, we got an internet rate of 47, so didn't expect luxury. However, the other people we went with had rooms that were OK. Ours was pretty shabby and the bathroom was awful.The suspended ceiling in the bathroom meant my husband couldn't have a shower without crouching down. There was mildew and mould in the bath and around the basin fittings. Loo seat was loose and the bathroom doors did not close properly or have a lock at all.The room also got pretty cold at night and there were no extra blankets provided. The decor was really poor.On our second morning we decided, for simplicity's sake, to pay for breakfast at the Travelodge. Avoid this at all costs. We went down before 9am and they at no time had full supplies of anything. Most of the hot food was gone and they brought replacements in such a piecemeal fashion that you couldn't eat the full breakfast at the same time! The toaster didn't work and the staff were surly.The location, however, is great so my recommendations would be:Get it as cheap as possibleGo to the nearby M&amp;S Food for suppliesGo to the greasy spoon opposite the station for breakfast (although it doesn't appear to open on Sat or Sun).Take a hairdryer -- they're not provided."
90,1311,"Jun 17 2007 	2nd Time here!!	I stayed here again for 4 night in January! Yes I know its a bit late to submit the review but though what the hey!!This time I experienced problems booking in. i had booked the super saver room 15.00 per night and paid for it in advance on a credit card. When I checked in they said the money hadn't been taken so I had to pay the 60.00 on my debit card. The super saver rooms can only be pre-paid so it was there site that was faulty. I contacted my card issuer and right enough the money hadn't been taken. The Manageress's attitude left a lot to be desired.Apart from that the room no 415?? was tiny and a lot nosier compared to our previous room 209 on our trip there in Nov '06.The room was clean, tidy and warm so was quite happy. The maids visited everyday so no complaints there.We went back here because of the location to shops, food outlets and tube stations. So the location makes up for the few minor problems that we experienced this time around.We're going back here in Aug 07 for 2 night break so do a new review then."
91,1311,"May 6 2007 	Great location	We stayed here 3 nights last month and would happily stay there again. The hotel is in a fabulous location - just walk out of Marylebone station, turn right, walk for 60 seconds! There were public phones on the street outside, plus on station, a taxi rank, plenty of places to eat, a Tesco supermarket 5 minutes level walk away, it's within walking distance of beautiful Regents Park, Madame Tussards etc. We extended our stay another night and had to pay 80 pounds for that compared to 26 and 49 pounds for the first 2 nights. Eighty pounds is a bit steep for what you get but the convenience and averaging it out were the deciding factors.Our room was clean (Room 204), didn't smell like cigarette smoke, looked down on the main street (and to the station entrance if you put your head out), the window opened a little and the staff were helpful.Somebody else mentioned the bathrooms and this was the only fault I could find. At first we thought the toilet was broken but there was a knack to flushing it. I like HOT bath/shower water but it seemed the water temperature had been set fairly low.All in all though I would have no hesitation in going back."
92,1311,"Apr 28 2007	ok for 15!	Stayed here in February 2006. For 15 quid I wasn't expecting a huge amount but it was ok. I'd booked a double smoking room. The room was a fair size, a bit worn &amp; tatty but acceptable clean apart from the absolutely filthy net curtains - they were grey with age/dirt!The bathroom had a cracked sink but was clean. The bed was a bit uncomfortable compared to other Travelodges I've stayed in. Every time I moved it creaked loudly!The location is fantastic. Literally 2 minutes from Marylebone station, and very easy to find. Don't bother with the hotel breakfast, across the road is a reasonably-priced cafe where I got brakfast &amp; coffee for under 3.00.All in all, if you can get a room for the 15/26 rate it's fine!"
93,1311,"Apr 24 2007 	OK if you don't mind mildew odors	I booked this hotel as a resting spot before getting an Easy Bus rideto Luton airport on our last day in London. I got the 15 pound rate which is close to what I'd have to pay for left luggage.The hotel is right outside the Marylebone tube station and about two blocks from the EasyBus stop.There are shops close by and in the station.The lobby and lift were fine but the odor of mildew hit you as soon as you walked in the door to the room. The entire ceiling by the window was covered in mildew. The wall paper is starting to curl and the toilet was a bit tempermental about flushing. There was a pretty big gap between the tile and the tub which was mildewy also.I wouldn't have been happy if I were spending the night, but as a place to rest after a long day it sure beat a bench in a train station. Plus we got our own bathroom."
94,1311,"Apr 20 2007 	Stay away!	Would not recommend this to anyone.Yes a good price, great location but thats about it.Rooms smell (no non smoking room). Hadnt been cleaned for about 3 weeks. Cleaner must just come in and make the beds. Taps missing off the bath; toenails all over the floor. Returned to room to find the door had been left open by the cleaner. Thankfully nothing was missing. Didnt ruin our trip though as we had a great time, love london, will definately come back, but not to this hotel."
95,1311,"Mar 9 2007 	Loved Travel Lodge!	23-26Feb 2007Really enjoyed our stay in London in this hotel. To be honest we didn't spend alot of time in the room. However the room was clean and fresh towels were supplied everyday. the location is great - less than 2mins walk from the nearest tube,and this will have you in Picadilly in ( 7min) we timed it!They will keep your cases if you check in early or have a late departure.The staff were helpful, we required an iron and this was provided immediately on request.The M&amp;S across the street is very handy and if in need if a quick and reasonably priced breakfast the cafe across from the station is cheep,quick and very good.Considering we have stayed in london for 1 weekeend every year for the past 8 and got this stay for the supersver rate of 26 ,I would say it's excellent value"
96,1311,"Mar 4 2007	Good basic accoomodation	Great cheerful staff and location, kept very clean and quite a large room. Have to agree that it really needs some refurbishment - some of the tiles were quite loose and the wall paper and upholstery on the chair were worn. You could say that at 75 it is cheaper than the local London Travel Inns, but they are all in a much better state of repair. I wouldn't be worried to stay here again, but probably not as a first choice."
97,1311,"Feb 23 2007 	Ideal location cheap and cheerful	Was staying up in London for 1 night mixing business with pleasure so wanted a reasonably priced hotel close to Paddington and Oxford Circus and found this Travelodge through their website - ---. 49 without Breakfast (that was charged seperately at 7.50 each which we didn't take, seems very over priced!). Room was spacious, although next to busy road so the planned lie in ended around 7am by being woken by the busy road outside - but what can you expect from London!Ideal location, no more than 1 minute walk from Marylebone tube station on Bakerloo line (Brown one!) with 10 minute trip to Oxford/Piccadilly Circus, Paddington only 10 minutes in the other direction.Room condition was average, expectations weren't great for only 49 - would think about staying again for business due to location, but may think of trying somewhere else when taking the other half."
98,1311,"Feb 19 2007 	Great Value Hotel	My son and I stayed here in a twin room from 13th- 15th February , having only paid the saver rate of 26 per night it was excellent value for money. The bathroom was a bit shoddy but what can you expect for this money,however the bedroom and linen were exceptionally clean so I would diffinately recommend it as a great place to stay if you are on a budget.Its proximity to the station was an added bonus. I hope this review helps."
99,1311,"Feb 19 2007	Friendly and helpful staff nice room.	We stayed here for three nights with a group of several people. At first I was reluctant to book as I had read the reviews on this site. However, our experience was very positive. All the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. The double rooms were of an adequate size. The windows were soundproofed, so noise was not an issue. The single room we had also booked was very small. As the room prices are the same, whether double or single, it makes little sense to book a single room. The location is excellent, well within walking distance of Marylebone High Street."
100,1311,"Feb 6 2007 	Amazing Value for a Saturday Night	Ok, the rooms are a bit tired and shabby (though i believe they're in the process of renovation) but if you get the Saver rate of 26 a room this place is great value for money.The rooms don't look like your standard, modern Travelodge but i think they took over this hotel and just made a few changes to bring it into the Travelodge brand. The rooms are a bit dark and dingey but clean and comfortable. The location is great as you can see the hotel as soon as you step out of the station (less than 2 mins walk). We didn't investigate the immediate area very much as we were only on a short stay but the nearby M&amp;S Simply Food was a useful 'local' store. We took the tube to Oxford Circus which was only 3 stops so i'm sure it would be walking distance in better weather.If all you're looking for is a clean and comfortable bed for the night then i don't think you'll be disappointed. I'd certainly stay again if i got the same rate."
101,1311,"Feb 3 2007	Satisfactory and Good Value	I stayed at Travelodge London Marylebone for one night on a leisure break. I arrived at Marylebone Railway Station and found the Travelodge easily.I was allocated a single room. This was smaller than I expected although adequate for my needs. I found it clean and fully functional. The room was en-suite (shower only).In the evening I ordered food from the Travelodge Bar Cafe. I found this to be satisfactory.I purchased a voucher for a cooked breakfast. In the morning I had a look at what was on offer in the breakfast room. I decided to have toast and cereal.I found the staff to be pleasant and helpful.I had paid a special pay-in-advance and I felt that this was good value. Based on my experience of this visit , I would stay again."
102,1311,Jan 27 2007	Beware of jewellry thiefs	Stayed in this hotel 5/7 Jan this year and until I checked my case when I returned home I would not have any problems in recommending it to people. However.... having checked my case I realised that my jewellry case was missing and nowhere to be found. I contacted the hotel on my return but indeed as the other reviewer who unfortunately had the same problem have not received a response from them. The hotel is clean but basic and in need of rennovation and I would have stopped here again had it not been for the apparent theft of my belongings.
103,1311,"Jan 25 2007 	Bargain in Central London	This Travelodge is great if your are looking for somewhere clean and tidy in the centre of London which doesn't cost a fortune. We booked a 26 saver room on the Travelodge website which proved to be very good value for money. The room was fairly standard for a Travelodge - quite basic but had what you needed (apart from a hairdryer). The hotel is right opposite the station where you can access land trains, underground or a constant queue of taxis which are waiting outside. I'm staying here again in April.There was some noise from the road but this wasn't a real problem. You expect some sort of noise in the middle of the city."
104,1311,Jan 8 2007 	do not trust the staff	I stayed here on the 3rd and 4th january 2007On the night before leaving i packed my stuff away into my case and my jewelery box was missing i searched the room for over an hour with nothing found I then went down to reception and told them what had happend.I was told by the nice man on the desk that this is not the first time this kinda thing has happend which shocked me.He told me he would tell the manger the next day. A week has now passed and i still have no answer i think its now a mater for the police
105,1311,"Nov 19 2006 	Would not stay here again.	Stayed 2 nights and not impressed overall. Checked in early and no problem there. Room was nice size but as the windows were very old and draughty, even with the heating on, very cold. Beds were very comfy and shower good after waiting 5 mins for the water to heat up. No problems with noise of traffic, we were on the 5th floor though. Room was in real need of being painted, a lot of holes and fingermarks!! Had breakfast on the first morning and was awful, bad stomach all day! Was cold and looked like it had been reheated from the previous day. Great location though, 1 min walk from Marylebone and nice walk to centre of London though not a lot of choice for night dining and drinks. Paid 75 each for 2 nights but can get a lot better hotel in nicer areas for same price. Not the worst hotel I have stayed in but would not stay here again."
106,1311,Nov 8 2006 	value for money	clean and brilliant location
107,1311,"Nov 1 2006 	Good staff nice location	We stayed here for three nights in late September. The first room we received smelled incredibly mouldy and damp; we later concluded that this was in large part due to a water leak in the breakfast room directly below. The second room we received had faulty plumbing. The third room was decent. While having to shift rooms twice was dismaying, the staff were very apologetic and helpful in ensuring that we got a good room. Kudos to them for that. The room itself was pretty much like the other Travelodge I have stayed in in London (TL Kings Cross Royal Scot)--decent, clean, but a bit worn.The hotel is located right beside the Marylebone rail and tube station, which is terrific, and is a couple of blocks from Baker Street Tube station. Also, as we discovered, Paddington Station is an easy fifteen minute walk--do-able even with our luggage. Thus, the hotel is a nice alternative to Paddington area ones if one wants proximity to the station or to the Heathrow Express service. There are many restaurants close by, and Oxford Street is a brisk fifteen minute walk .Our overall impression of the hotel is that there are some ongoing maintenance issues with the property, which could make a stay rather dreary. The staff appear to work hard to make things right for guests, however, which really helps. We paid the 26 pound saver rate, and for that the hotel is indeed a great bargain. At the full rate, I think better places can be found in the larger area."
108,1311,"Oct 26 2006 	Great value for 26 pounds!!	If you can get this for 26 pounds it has to be the best deal in London. The proximity to the tube is the best thing, especially travelling with kids who were sick of walking! There was a great little place for breakfast across from the station, lovely staff and cheap quick and yummy meals to start the day. We had two rooms and although one had a distinct musty smell (put hubby and one child in that one!!) the other was fine. Showers were old but worked perfectly, beds comfortable but not perfect. All in all we had a fab time in London and it was great to come back to a clean and fairly spacious room at the end of the day to sleep. If this is available for 26 pounds again, book a room and enjoy the sights of this gorgeous city!"

1,1318,"Oct 31 2007 	Good Area bad hotel	My firends and got there solely for the internet price we had found. The area aroung the hotel is very good and there is close tube station near it. The rooms are terible. We had a three bed room with all the beds being pushed together with a small passage in front of the beds. The bathroom might seem convenient if you are not bigger than a 8year old child.The breakfast room was a bit like the rooms and the bathroom, really cramped and smelly."
2,1318,"May 13 2007 	You Get What You Pay For-	I stayed here in mid-April for 7 nights. I picked the Hotel based on the cheap price and location. Its right across from a park in a cute neighborhood. The hotel was a little rough around the edges. The people behind the desk were all new and knew little about both London and the hotel, but for the most part were helpful. The room I had was very small, and never vacumed the entire week I was there, although sheets etc. were changed/cleaned. I would recommend the hotel if your on a budget and dont mind &quot;roughing&quot; it a little bit."
3,1318,"Mar 13 2007 	oh my god what a dump this place is!!!	under no circumstances would i recommend this hotel to anyone, not even students on a shoestring budget. i've stayed in hostels that are cheaper, safer, better run, and *cleaner*!!despite having booked several weeks prior, i arrived to discover that they didn't seem to have my reservation. but they did have one room left, which i was given. the room was dirty, dingy, rundown and located on the depressing ground floor. the mattress looked and felt to be about 10 years old. and the phone did *not* work!!!!!!!!!! when i asked the desk clerk when phone service would be restored, he said *maybe* monday, but he wasn't sure. i arrived on a saturday. when i asked if there was a public computer i could use to access the internet, i was informed that that didn't work either. when i asked if i could be moved to a nicer room (i.e., a clean room that wasn't tatty and didn't smell), i was told that there were no other rooms available. i grabbed my bags and literally fled to another hotel in the neighborhood. as a resident of nyc, i'm used to properties that are a bit rundown, but if they are clean, safe, reasonably priced and have character, i'm ok with it. this place stunk of cigarette smoke, was seedy, depressing, unclean, in *no way* represented the services they advertise on various websites, and too expensive for such miserable (--). pardon my graphic language. but don't even consider staying here. it's disgusting."
4,1318,"Jan 7 2007 	Stay Away!	As part of an airline's travel package, I selected the Tria Hotel because of its cost and acceptable reviews. I was traveling to London and later Paris, alone, to celebrate my birthday.What a mistake to choose the Tria!My threadbare, single room was drafty because of a broken window in the bathroom, and, worse yet, stone-cold the three nights I was there. I eventually came to understand that the desk clerk(s) controlled the thermostat for the entire hotel. (Perhaps this is standard in budget European hotels?) When the lobby was warm, she or he would turn down the thermostat. It was cold and rainy in London that week, and I am fortunate I didn't catch pneumonia.Since I had to block the cold coming in from the bathroom window with one of the two towels they provided me, I had to ask for a clean bath towel each day, which I was given reluctantly.The breakfast was adequate, because having been to London before, I knew I was in store for cereal, toast, and coffee. The desk clerks weren't rude, exactly, but they exuded a &quot;I don't care&quot; attitude. They also misled me about the use of the phone in my room -- although I had a calling card, I still had to pay connection fees and a non-refundable deposit.None of the clerks I encountered were British.Just as miserable as the hotel was the seedy neighborhood in which it is located. I don't know if it was because of construction, or because late November is the off-season for tourists, the well-recommended Indian restaurant and Italian bistro just a couple of streets over from the Tria were closed. And, the Tube station closest to the Tria, Westbourne Park, had no security guards (or even ticket-sellers that I could see). The walk to it was a little hairy, again because of the renovation of apartment buildings and empty storefronts.There was nothing open in the Tria's neighborhood at night, unless you count the Pizza Hut, a package store, and one smoky pub.Again, I understand this area is undergoing gentrification, which accounts for the construction and closed storefronts. But I will not stay at the Tria and DO NOT recommend it for any traveler -- single, couples, or groups."
5,1318,"Jan 3 2007	Great location not great staff!	The Tria hotel is beautifully located in the Kensington area of London. Upon arrival we were &quot;greeted&quot; by a dour slavic lady who was none too helpful in terms of providing directions or giving me any information on the neighbourhood. The room itself was tiny but clean. The bathroom was laughably small but my mom and I managed. It would have been helpful had we been given more than one towel each though -they refused to provide us with more even after we asked them. The television only had about 4 channels but it would seem this isn't uncommon in budget hotels in London. One good point was the internet access in the reception area was very cheap (equal to the rates charged in the cafes in the neighbourhood) so this was quite convenient. Also, my mother and I found the breakfast to be satisfactory however the &quot;cafeteria&quot; itself was rather cramped. Unfortunately, when it came time for us to leave and we asked the woman at the desk to call us a cab, we were met with a rather shady figure who arrived in an unmarked vehicle without a meter. He demanded 6 pounds (twice what it had cost us for the trip in a real cab) for any trip no matter how close. When I asked the staff to please call us a real cab she flatly refused much to my astonishment. There was some kind of agreement between the &quot;chauffeur&quot; and the hotel staff from what I could see. This was offputting to say the least. So in summary, not bad but for the cramped quarters and rude staff (incidentally, the male staff were much friendlier and more helpful.) If you are on a budget, I would recommend this hotel. And if you happen to speak Polish, perhaps the ladies will be more congenial to you."
6,1318,"Dec 16 2006 	Had a lovely stay at the Tria	Stayed at the Tria for 3 days late november.A little hard to find, but that`s because it took me forever to admit defeat and get to an internet cafe and find a map online. After that it was easy.Tria is a little hidden in a side street so there`s very little traffic noise.The staff was very helpful and nice.The rooms were clean and bigger than the price might suggest.Bathroom was small, but nice, with a shower. Got fresh towels each morning. Will recommend to all my friends."
7,1318,"Nov 16 2006 	Wonderful!	I was really worried when our driver didn't know where the hotel was. But once we got there I was pleasantly surprised, it looked nice. Check in was smooth, there was a lift up, the room was bigger than I thought. It was clean, and over all really pleasant. The bathroom was newly redone. Nothing was ruined or broken in any way. Although the room didn't have everything the hotel claim it would have (Radio,Tea &amp; Coffee Equipment). The staff was pleasant and helpful when we asked for directions. I could easily go there again."
8,1318,"Nov 5 2006 	satisfactory for a sightseeing base	We stayed at the Tria for 1 night whilst visiting London to see a show. It was reasonably priced so we weren't expecting luxury. When we arrived we were greeted at reception and check-in went smoothly. The reception area was small and smelt a little of stale smoke but apart from that it was clean. The rooms were small as stated by others in their reviews but adequate. Not may coat hangers were provided. The bathroom was quite nice with a shower and clean towels. There was also a wall mounted hairdryer. Breakfast was a help yourself affair to tea, coffee and juice, whilst a waitress (without so much as a smile or a good morning) brought the toast. Maybe she couldn't speak english as most of the staff in London weren't English.The hotel is well located with the bus stop just down the road and a tube station a little further away. I wouldn't say that there was a great choice of bars or restaurants in the immediate viccinity and found ourselves eating a take away pizza for our evening meal as the restaurants were closed by the time we arrived back after the show. In my opinion we got what we paid for and providing your stay is for a short break this hotel is fine."
9,1318,"Sep 29 2006 	Nice budget hotel	We have just come back from a month in the UK. We were booked into the Tria for 3 nights as part of a package put together by our travel agent. Having read all the reviews on here I knew it wasn't going to be 4 star and it wasn't. The room was just big enough to walk around the bed and the bathroom was also very small, but adequate. Our room was on the third floor overlooking the garden on the other side of the street. It was quiet even though the bus route was at the end of the street. The buses come frequently and having a travel card made it easy to go anywhere in the city from there. There is a pub a minutes walk away as well as a good choice of restaurants. The receptionist was helpful whenever we asked for information and because our flight into London was so early we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel for the day and check in that evening. The breakfast was as described in previous reviews, though my husband asked for and got another piece of toast every morning. London is an expensive place and you get what you pay for. The Tria was fine for what we wanted - a place to sleep at night after a busy day siteseeing."
10,1318,"Sep 22 2006 	Look for alternatives to the Tria	Having stayed at numerous budget hotels in the UK previously, I thought I knew what to expect from the Tria. Despite being situated in a great neighborhood, I was disapointed in the Tria, and would not stay there again. Problems begain immediately; we went to shower just after checking in, and found that the towels in the bathroom were dirty. This could have been overlooked if the staff had not been clearly annoyed by our polite request for 2 clean towels. The wake up call we requested for 3:30 pm didn't come until 3:30 am, less than desirable after a night on a plane. The door lock was duct taped together, and the TV we wanted only for weather and news never worked. Breakfast was a bowl of cornflakes, coffee, and 2 pieces of toast each that usually arived at the table long after cornflakes and coffee were gone. With the exception of the young man on the night desk, the staff was indifferent to the point of hostility. The one saving grace was the location, in a diverse lively neighborhood full of all types of restaurants and take away snacks of all kinds. This area is convenient to the Westbourne, Bayswater and other tube stations, Portobello market, and provides access to numerous bus routes. I will definitely stay in this area again but not at the Tria."
11,1318,"Sep 6 2006 	Nice stay in Tria	My sister &amp; I stayed here from the 12th till the 16th of August 2006. We stayed on the 5th floor. We were informed when checked in that the lift only goes from the basement to the 4th floor. At least the receptionist informed us of this. From the lift you have to go left, though the door directly in front of you, then right, stright ahead, right again and take the last door on the left.The rooms are very small yes but as most of the residents in the hotel were touists, then this should not worry anyone at all. My sister and I got on fine with this very small room as we were out most of the day. In the bath room there is a extractor fan as there is not window. Its a shower, sink and toilet. Its grand like the room as you will be out seeing the sights every day.Breakfast is the same every day of tea/coffee, orange juice, cornflakes, toast and milk. Thats it. Its fine as it fills you for the morning.Its location is fine also. The number 7 bus is right outside the door. This bring you right to Oxford Street, you even pass Paddingtion station on route. Once you either Paddingtion or Oxford Street you can go any where with the tube.Over all, good location, good bus service, nice receptionist (only area where smoking allowed, not allowed in any bedrooms) basis breakfast and fine for a quick trip to London."
12,1318,"Aug 13 2006 	Tria Hotel	The hotel is okay, but the bedroom is really small and old. The safety box stays in the reception, and not in the bedroom. The bedroom is clean and the staff is kind.The lift only goes to the 4th floor, so if your room is in the 5th floor you have to take the stairs.It is near from the tube (Westbourne Park Station), there is a bus stop in front of the hotel, and has good restaurants nearby.The park in front of the hotel is really charming, and it is worth a visit."
13,1318,"Jul 6 2006	Great Little Place	Tria is a great little place if you're on a budget. The rooms, though tiny, serve their purpose, and the breakfast provided was enough to get through the morning. If you stay here, be sure to check out the tiny little garden across the street - hit a store around the corder, pick up a few Stella Artois and some munchies, and have a nice afternoon! This is how my fiance proposed to me!"
14,1318,"Mar 27 2006	Tria is Great for the Budget-minded London Explorer	The Tria Hotel is in the same neighborhood where Michael Caine's character lived in the original movie Alfie. There's a sweet little garden running down the boulevard that gives the surrounding a less urban feel. What the hotel lacks in wall thickness (it was a tad noisy from other guests coming in late from the pubs on Saturday night) it completely made up for in charm, location and ease of transportation. There's a bus stop just a few steps away that is used by six different busses. For my family, the Tria filled our needs well. We were gone from the room exploring the city most of the day and the beds were comfy, so it filled our simple needs perfectly.Although I'd read a few complaints about Tria's breakfast, I enjoyed it. The morning staff, mostly comprised of young French women, efficiently served the juice, coffee, tea, cereal, milk and toast in the breakfast room. Often, we chatted with other guests. The arrangement of the room promotes that kind of interaction. We picked up a small wheel of delicious brie at Portobello Road Market, nearby the hotel, to supplement our brekkies and stored it on the window sill at night to keep it cool. That made for a lovely start to the day. The staff was multi-cultural and pleasant, but not extremely knowledgeable about bus routes, etc. If you buy an Oyster card, you can use all of London's extremely efficient means of transportation without having to buy individual trip tickets. Ask the locals at the stop where the bus goes until you get used to it. There were plenty of good places in the neighborhood to eat, but one I was particularly impressed with was Star of Bombay. Also, the fish and chips at the Metro Pub, right next to Westbourne Park Tube Station, is some of the best I've had in London.By all means, select the Tria Hotel if you're a budget-minded traveler wanting to explore London."
15,1318,"Mar 4 2006	Cleanbasicgood location	Just returned from a one week stay at the Tria with my teen age daughter.We booked the hotel as part of a package thru Go-Today.com.The Tria was basic budget accomodations.Our twin room was small,but comfortable and quiet.The bathroom was small,but clean,plenty of hot water,and good water pressure in the small shower.We really liked the location,very close to bus stop, Portabello Road, a couple of restaurants,coffee shops,and a bakery.Only complaint was the smoke filled lobby.We would stay there again."
16,1318,"Jan 7 2006	Smoking in Lobby a Serious Draw-back	When having to enter and exit this facility through a seriously air-polluted lobby, even the nice location and proximity to the bus made this place one I could not want to recommend. The room(s) (we actually asked to be moved) we saw were really small (even for 2 people), and the first was really awkwardly arranged with the bath and closet on a small landing outside the bedroom. I didn't think the front desk staff was all that helpful - if we had not needed extra assistance with a problem steming from the loss of a piece of medical equipment and car keys on our flight, the service might have been adequate. But everything seemed to be a big deal - from trying to use a calling card in the pay phone, to having to have phone service turned on in the room, to paying 8 times the out of hotel rate to use the internet in the lobby - one pound for 30 minutes vs. 40 pence for an hour at a shop on Westborne Grove Rd. - a 15 minute walk. Anyone familiar with &quot;English Breakfast&quot; should also not expect it here - 2 pieces of toast with corn flakes and coffee is what was offered. Also, because it happened that we generally don't do &quot;after dark&quot; activities, we tried the TV reception in the room, only to find no BBC! Skye was all that we found - what a disappointment."
17,1318,"Dec 6 2005	Great connections to bus service	We stayed at Tria over thanksgiving holidays. This was part of a package we purchased. Standard double room for London in a small hotel.Small,with closet. No frills. Bathroom clean; recently redone: new tile, fixtures. Fresh towels daily. Plenty of hot water in the shower, hair dryer on the wall, dried even my thick hair quickly.Room has new carpeting, and if we were here in the summer the room we had(107) would have been perfect- window opens onto the portico roof and has a couple of chairs to enjoy the summer evening. Alas, it was winter. For a budget hotel this one is fine. Not far from Portobello Road/Notting Hill Gate. Bus stops right outside: no.7 (goes all the way to Oxford Circus and right by Paddington station).Road noise was noticable but not disturbingly so. Staff were helpful with our questions and helping us with taxi arrangements for early morning departure. Not the Ritz, but ok if you are only sleeping, not living in the room."
18,1318,"Oct 20 2005	great place to stay	We've just returned from almost 2 weeks in London, during which we stayed at the Tria hotel.First of all, we enjoyed our stay and the hotel was perfectly ok!We've booked the room on the internet, via [...] - where you pay only a small amount to secure your booking, and the rest is paid directly in the hotel. Also, the price in this site was quite small - only 42.73 pounds a day (for 2 people + continental breakfast).It is a small hotel, located on a very quiet street and overlooking a small park.It is 5 minutes by foot from the nearest tube (Westbourne Park station), and you can get to a station with better choice of tube lines by bus just outside the hotel (every 5 minutes, a 5 minutes bus ride to Notting Hill Gate station).It is also in a walking distance from Paddington train station.The hotel overall is very clean, and it's a non-smoking hotel, which was very fine with us.The only place where smoking is allowed is in the lobby.In the lobby, there is a soft-drinks machine, a place to sit (sofas, TV and such), internet (0.5 pound for 0.5 hour), and a place where you can prepare tea and coffee (for free).There is also a safe deposit box that cost us only 3 (or 5???????????) pounds for all our stay.The room: of course it wasn't big, but for 2 persons it was fine. There are nice claret-colored carpets on the floor, and the mattresses have just been replaced with new ones (it happened during our stay). A mirror has also been added above the desk (although still a lamp lacks above it to turn it to a dressing table).I think the total room (including the en-suite shower) was around 3x5 meters.In the room there were: a double bed, a big wardrobe with mirrors as doors, a small writing desk (2 drawers and a bigger compartment) with a small lamp, a chair, a &quot;trouser press&quot; (a strange machine that presses and heats trousers - to replace ironing; didn't venture to use this thing, though), a TV set+remote, a telephone (we didn't try to call from it, but we did receive a call), and 2 glasses.There was no tea/coffee tray in the room.There is no air conditioning, which can be a problem in the summer. There is a small air-opening in the window (which can be closed), and it was enough for ventilation, most of the time of our stay.The shower looks pretty new and nice, there is also a toilet, and a washing basin (with one tap and hot-cold water mixer, and not 2 taps as it is in many places in England).In the shower: 2 big towels, 2 towel pegs, a feet towel, soap, hairdryer, a place to plug a shaver in. No hand towels, no shampoo.There was continental breakfast included, consisting of (and only): a small glass of orange juice, tea/coffee, milk, a bowl of cornflakes, 2 toasts, jam, butter. We did occasionally ask and get more toasts. Overall it was enough for us for a light breakfast.There wasn't any alteration in the food, except one-time different type of cornflakes.On the whole, the food wasn't anything incredible, but it was all fresh and I'd say usual.The breakfast room is in the basement but it has windows, and doesn't look dark at all.Tips:Remember to bring the special electricity plug for the UK sockets.It was very convenient and very worthy to buy unlimited 7-days oyster travelcard, which allows you to travel unlimited in selected zones of the tube and also on the buses. see http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl for more details."
19,1318,"Jun 13 2005	Not too bad if you're on a budget	My 14 year old daughter and I stayed there as part of a package with Go-Today travel, and it was our first visit to London. The rooms don't have and thermostats in the room, so it was a bit chilly in the room, but the staff gave us a portable heater which warmed up the room just fine (the room is quite small). We had arrived 4 hours earlier than our check in time, but the staff was able to get us into a cleaned room within an hour. The breakfasts were included, but nothing spectacular....toast, jam, corn flakes, and tea or coffee. The closest metro is about 5 blocks away, but we felt completely safe walking back to the hotel late at night. It was quite a distance from most of the landmarks we wanted to see, but if you don't mind the subways, most things are just one or two trains aways since Paddington Station is only 2 stops from the subway near the hotel. The only 2 things that were problematic were that our shower hose had a hole in it, which made the water pressure pretty poor, and one day, our hotel door wouldn't open and the maintenance man had to come up and literally take the door off to fix the electronic lock. If you're looking for a hotel as somewhere to sleep while you enjoy the sights of London, this one is perfect, but if you want something even remotely luxurious, this is not the hotel for you. Personally, we were there to see London, not the inside of a hotel room."
20,1318,"Mar 1 2005	Great location	Just got back from a week in London where I stayed at the Tria. I had a single room, small but adequate. The twelve-foot ceilings made the room seem larger. The small bathroom had all new fixtures. The heating system worked really well--not chilly like some London hotels in winter. I loved the quiet street (Even though I was on the front facing the street, I never heard any street noise.) The walls were very thick, so I heard little from the rooms above or next to me. The best feature was the location. Across the street were bus stops for buses to Notting Hill Gate--where I transferred to the Tube or to other bus routes. The Westbourne Park tube station was a few blocks walk, as was the Portobello Road market. I didn't really care for the breakfast that was offered--very basic, just corn flakes, toast, orange juice, coffee and tea. Some fresh fruit would have made me happy. I skipped the breakfast after the first couple of days and found cozy cafes near-by that offered homemade scones, etc. A good choice for the budget traveller--for me the money saved meant buying more books to lug home..."
21,1318,"Mar 1 2005	Pretty Average	We thought this hotel was pretty average. It was booked as part of a package deal with Creative Holidays, and we found it to be poor value. The room was very small and the bathroom a little bit smelly. There was nothing wrong with the hotel per se, but at nearly 80 pounds a night, I am sure you could find something much nicer. (Whether that is a reflection on the package or the hotel itself I am not sure). There was one thing we found a little bit odd; we had to pay a pound in order to have the phone line 'opened' to make phone calls using our calling card. Unfortunately, the line 'closed' again before we had completed our stay."
22,1318,"Dec 27 2004	Basic	We got this hotel as part of a package deal from a travel agent, it was a preety raw deal, we wouldn't have chosen it ourselves. Preety upset with our travel agent for putting us up in this dump. I gather the walk in rate is 55-75 pounds, that's a rip off. My wife and I stayed here 22nd-26th November 2004. It was rough. The room was so small, we had to walk sideways between the bed and the built in wardrobe. The bed sheets were as rough as rice sacks. The only redeeming feature is the bathroom is clean and new. Location wise, it is about a 8 to 10 minutes walk to the nearest subway station westbourne park, although if you walk a bit further the opposite direction to Hydepark hill gate station (I Think), it's much better station to get off, there is a bus 28 to and fro from this station. Breakfast of toasts and jam and cornflakes to start your day with, makes you cringe, although the hot coffee is not bad. If I were you I'd get a hotel around Gloucester park area, much better location and about the same rate will get you a better level of accomodation."
23,1318,"Dec 17 2004	Not bad  will probably go again	We stayed in the Tria Hotel earlier this year. It's really ok for travellers who do not spend much time in the rooms. No problems with the rooms. Generally clean and well equipped, only very small as many users pointed out. Only BIG issue for me was the breakfast. As a budget traveller I thought I would eat well at the hotel in the morning in order not to have to spend too much on food during the day. Unfortunately, I am also health concious, and do not consider cornflakes nutritional. Toast is not a problem, except that they only had the white variety. Besides that, they had everything we needed for a reeasonable hotel stay."
24,1318,"Nov 17 2004	Not a great deal	We stayed at the Tria for six nights in November of 2004. We had the option of staying at five other hotels but this one had the least negative reviews. The location was good and the bathroom had nice tile and hot water but otherwise, it was a very basic room. There were two bath towels but only one towel ring in the bathroom. There were no handtowels or wash cloths. The 'breakfast' amounted to piled up bowls of one kind of corn flakes type cerial, some sort of orange drink and coffee. The (non english speaking) crew would bring you toast from some back room, three slices at a time. There was butter and jelly available to put on that. As Yanks, we wanted ice in the drinks wewere having in our room. One nice desk clerk found some for us but the others directed us to the nearest market that sold ice. If you're going to bargain shop for rooms in London, don't expect a lot more than we got at the Tria. By U.S. standards, there are no bargains there. Prices are totally beyond belief."
25,1318,"Oct 4 2004	Bad deal at any price	I booked a room at the Tria for three nights. I was attracted by the price and the nice pictures on the Website. Well, my room didn't look anything like the pictures. It was a dingy, tiny, nasty room in the basement, next to the lift and the breakfast room. In addition to being a bit chilly because the heat wasn't yet on, the room was equipped with a pump in the bathroom to pump the water into the drainage system. On the last morning the pump stopped working while I was taking a shower and a major flood ensued. Fortunately, I wasn't electricuted! I checked out a day early as soon as I could without incurring a penalty. On the positive side, the staff were very pleasant."
26,1318,Jul 21 2004	clean but tiny	Clean and pleasant. However the room is extremely small.Could hardly open our luggage. The photos don't give a true representation. The staff was helpful.we would recommend it only to single or young travelers.
27,1318,"Jul 19 2004	Good budget hotel	The Tria is a good hotel for the budget conscious, especially in very pricey London. International clientele all ages. No frills here. Cost 65 a night for a twin room, less if booked on a website like London.Net. Small room, with cable TV and remote, telephone, and coffee/tea making equipment. Think basic dorm room. On the plus side: Clean, comfortable bed and pillows, remodeled bathrooms with great shower, all rooms nonsmoking (a rarity in London), internet access in lobby (1 per 30 minutes), quiet street location with little noise within hotel except sound of water pipes in walls, fridge in lobby stocked with drinks for sale. Negatives: although hotel is generally nonsmoking, smoking is allowed on one side of the small lobby. If you have a room on the ground floor, smoke smell can drift under door. We paid by credit card which converted bill to $ at a higher than current exchange rate. Reception said there was nothing they could do about it--that the machine did it automatically. No time to discuss this as we were rushing to catch a train. But since the British also use this hotel, assume that they can charge in s too. They arranged a cab to take us to train station but it turned out to be a private cab with no meter and a set rate of 7 to Paddington. Rate okay but don't know about liability issues and such. Not a lot of restaurants in immediate neighborhood but what's there were good. You can walk a few long blocks to busy streets to have more choices. All in all would probably stay there again. Especially if exchange rate stays high."
28,1318,"Jun 12 2004	Great for the price!	Clean modern room, OK breakfast &amp; good cofee included, good location, great price! The Tria was exactly what we were looking for! About 3 blocks to the Underground, bus stop right outside, nice park across the street. Always had somebody who spoke good English at the desk, and very helpful. It's true that the rest of the staff didn't understand any language we knew (as many reviewers have noted), but they were nice. If you're looking for a decent place to stay, &amp; don't care about room service or a place to entertain (or impress) guests, then this is a great hotel!"
29,1318,"Apr 10 2004	Tria - small! tidy	The Tria was in a great location, only 5 minutes walk from the London underground. I found the rooms extremely small but clean and well kept. Small bathroom, but quite new. Comfortable beds. Downside - it was VERY small. &quot;breakfast&quot; consisted of 2 pieces of toast, 1 bowl of cornflakes(pre-measured), juice, tea or coffee. (not really a sufficient breakfast!). Staff friendly, try to help when necessary, but really didn't know how most the time. Had a couple of shirts &quot;misplaced&quot; in the room, called to see if we were had left them there. Staff couldn't &quot;find&quot; them in the room!!! Make you want out of that...Not a bad place in all 2/5 January 2004"
30,1318,"Mar 10 2004	Perfect for short trips	We, my girlfriend and me, stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. Rooms very clean, with shower and TV. My room was a double one, with a 2x2 bed, daily clean. By bues, it is 15 minutes lo London Victoria, and 5 minutes to Notting Hill Gate, taking the bus just at 30 metres outside the hotel. Beauty neighbourhood and quite zone. Good breakfast and nice staff. I recommend it for short stays and visitors with no much money. Bye"
31,1318,"Feb 24 2004	Clean well situated  good price	Well, we went to London not to move around in a hotel room but in the city! The hotel is comfortable and clean. Service is good. So the breakfast. Easily accessible even by mother with three small kids. We enjoyed it!"
32,1318,"Dec 9 2003	Staying at the Tria Hotel	The Tria Hotel was included as part of a hotel/air fare package offered by the travel agency I made arrangements with. Bear in mind that there are different types of hotels to accomodate the different needs of travelers. The Tria Hotel is designed for the budget conscious. Don't expect a porter to help bring your bags to your room or airport transportation. Yes, as a previous reviewer indicated, the rooms are small and are not designed for entertaining. If you do not like your room they will offer to place you in another room, if available. However, the hotel is very clean and there are two sitting areas within the lobby of the hotel for meeting friends. There are bus lines at the street corner and the nearest underground station is about three blocks away. The staff is very helpful although English is not their native language. As of November (when I stayed at the hotel), a comlimentary breakfast of cereal, toast, juice, coffee and tea is served daily in their breakfast room (they do not serve lunch or dinner). I have traveled for twenty years and have experienced all different types of hotels. All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the Trada."
33,1318,"Nov 16 2002	Disliked the Tria Hotel	Rooms were terribly small. Two people were not free to move around. No room for TV except up on bracket. No remote and TV buttons too high to reach without standing on chair. Pillows so hard and thick that we were forced to go out and buy pillows. Continental breakfast consisted of orange juice, toast and cheap cornflakes. Help did not speak English (mostly French &amp; German). Would not stay there again."

1,1320,Trip in London	Great service quite friendly and helpfull staff The room we had was quite small but very cosy..English breakfast eggs and bacon wich i dislike but that is personnal ....What i like most is the location well situated in the heart of London and surrounded by old and Victorian buildings...This is how you want to see London and is diversity with different type of restaurant and prices are affordable ....
2,1320,"Nov 24 2009 	A Fantastic Birthday Break!	I stayed at the Tudor Court Hotel for a week-long birthday celebration with my husband and we absolutely loved everything about it! Staff are excellent - friendly and completey service oriented. A real welcoming atmosphere with professionalism! The room was great, albeit, small, but very well appointed with modern facilities (loved the LCD flatscreen with Freeview in my room!)...Very comfortable. The Neighborhood is fabulous for shopping etc (the reason for my stay!) you are right in the heart of West London, so there is so many great shopping, restaurants &amp; museums etc to explore. You have great areas to see - Soho, China Town, The West End, East End, the list goes on! The Hotel is within walking distance of great restaurants, bars, shops. I found that travel around the city is very accessible without any hassle or stress. Loads of information is provided from the hotel, like I mentioned the staff are very approachable.I highly recommend this hotel to anyone! Breakfast is great! A great lounge/lobby seating area if you are waiting or just taking a rest from a busy days shopping-site seeing. Even when we had checked out and found that we had some extra time on our hands before our departure. The staff kindly stored our luggage safely for free! This was great as it gave us great relief and peace of mind to enjoy are final hours in London. Over all this is fantastic hotel and I strongly recommend it. I will definitely find an excuse for another trip to London in the near future!"
3,1320,"Nov 13 2009 	EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE YOU SHOULD STAY	Location is great just near 200 metre from Paddington Station. There have been excellent hospitality, rooms are new refurbished. Clean, friendly I recommend definetly. I staed 4 nights. It is a reasonable price hotel with excellent location for London. Owner is Indian, and they are very friendly and helpfull. There is alot of nice restaurants arounds (italian, steak houses, mcdonald's, burger king..etc) and easy to reach from all airports."
4,1320,"Oct 20 2009 	Clean great staff central great value for money	This hotel is family run and the service is great - it's a no fuss hotel which is incredibly central, it's clean, breakfast is great and the family have great local knowledge about where to eat, drink and visit. I keep going back and will. It's about 2 minutes walk from Paddington Station and there are loads of buses into the West End. IThey've suggested great places to eat and they're always right."

Mr. and Mrs. Gupta are warm and welcoming hosts and their staff is exceptional. The breakfasts are great and the location is perfect, close to Paddington Station, the tube and Heathrow Express. Norfolk Square across the street is a beautiful green space in the middle of a lively neighborhood...a walk in Hyde Park only a few blocks away. I will always look forward to another stay there. Pat (California, USA)"
6,1320,"Oct 13 2009 	Friendly and helpful owners/managers and great location!	We have stayed here twice and will always return. It is located truly one minute from Paddington Station, but looks out on a nice little park. Restaurants all around. The staff and owners and so VERY nice and helpful. The rooms are small, but clean and come with brand new big screen t.v.s. The included breakfast is good too! I certainly recommend staying here."
7,1320,"Oct 4 2009 	Overpriced BAD Internet Service	I chose TC over others on Norfolk Square mainly for the free wireles. The 1st room they gave me got no internet reception at all, the second room - closer to lobby - it came and went and was very slow. Ultimately I went to the hotel next DOOR and PAID for a voucher to use their wireless, and it worked just fine! Wireless only works in the lobby of TC, and only sometimes. Rooms are tiny and beds are as hard as boards. I've stayed at several BnB's in and around Norfolk Square, and will never stay at TC Hotel again."
8,1320,"Sep 28 2009 	central clean hospitable and affordable... I will stay again.. gabriel	I was only looking for a place to sleep as I was all day out but given its location, cleanliness, and friendliness of the stuff, not to mention the incredible price turned out to be a very pleasant experience. I will definitely come back. Gabriel"
9,1320,"Sep 28 2009 	My stay at The Tudor Court Hotel was First Class	I have to say I had a really lovely stay at the Tudor Hotel from start to finish. We were greeted by a friendly receptionist. He recommended a few places to go and booked our taxi for later on.The rooms are lovely, colourful and bright. They were clean and well equipped i.e. LCD flatscreens, hairdryer, iron etc. Because we stayed in the winter the room was nice and warm. V. cosy...but not too stuffy.The full english breakfast was great.I liked the fact that the hotel was quite central to the West End shops and the torurist attractions. The tubes and buses were just round the corner. Also there is a train that goes directly to Heathrow Airport from Paddington.I'm looking forward to staying there again this December."
10,1320,"Sep 22 2009 	I always come back to the Tudor Court - friendly staff fantastic location	The Tudor Court is the best budget hotel I've stayed at. The rooms are always clean, the staff friendly and you sure can't beat the location - I've stayed here three times and am always a little sad to leave, (but always with a full tum from the great breakfast included!) and I always feel I've received excellent value for my money - highly and honestly recommended unless you're planning a trip when I go! I don't want to stay any place else!"
11,1320,Sep 19 2009 	My stay was absolutely lovely great accommodation will be using hotel again	Excellent stay staff very helpful even down to finding me cheap all day parking for my vehicle. Will be using again as also very central to London. 5****
12,1320,"Sep 14 2009 	It's like being at home	We arrived at Paddington station really tired, but the welcome attitude to recieved at this hotel made us forget about our long and exhausting journey, the changes that's been made to the hotel, since our last stay, are excellent, rooms very clean and cosy. I would be recommending it to anyone, it's like I have my own home in the heart of London."
13,1320,Sep 13 2009 	We will definitely be returning to Tudor Court Hotel. Very warm and friendly atmosphere and the owners are so helpful!	We will definitely be returning to Tudor Court Hotel. The staff were warm and friendly and the owners were so helpful and accommodating. Our double was clean and a great price for an on-suite in such a central London location.Will be recommending to friends visiting London.
14,1320,"Sep 13 2009 	Helpful staff comfortable accomodation good base for travelling throughout London or indeed passing through	Being aware of the current climate, admire the efforts being made to update the hotel ready for 2012"
15,1320,"Aug 3 2009 	freiendly hotel and well located	I was travelling to London on holiday, and booked on recommendation to the Tudor Court. It was great value for money and also offered a full english breakfast. It is close to the tube and the west end and offers a variety of rooms according to your budget. Would definitely stay there again."
16,1320,Aug 3 2009 	IDEAL	Stayed at Tudor Court five times now.After reading some of the other reviews I have always found the hotel to be clean.The staff friendly and ideally situated close to Paddington Underground and train station this presents the noise from the underground but you cant have it all and its hardly the hotels fault.Will continue to use the hotel in future when I am in London!
17,1320,"Aug 3 2009 	lower your expectations!	The photos look great and many of the reviews are positive so steel yourself for tiny rooms, threadbare carpet on the stairs and mediocre food. We almost walked out when we saw our miniscule room. You can probably do better than this hotel - there are many others in the street to choose from. Breakfast? It was only on Day 3 that we found out you can have cereal (you have to ask for it) and that you can specify how you want your eggs cooked. The toast comes in a variety of shades from white to charcoal and don't bother asking for wholemeal. Our room was noisy from street traffic and smelly from smokers in the street below. We had nowhere to put our bags and played Tetris around one another negotiating the narrow spaces to get from bed to bathroom etc.On the plus side - it's a convenient location, we had a good-sized flat screen TV with good reception and the bathroom was clean. My advice ... keep looking!"
18,1320,"Jul 31 2009 	Excellent value for money	I was travelling with my brother and his girlfriend and we stayed in a triple room. Simple but confortable, nice English breakfast, very central and good value for money... What else could we ask for? I had booked 2 months ago when I just recently read the bad review and was slightly worried about bad comments. But staff were actually very friendly and amenities clean."
19,1320,"Jul 5 2009 	excellent location	I had made a lot of research on the Net before actually booking this hotel and Trip Advisor was of great help to me. I booked a triple for 99 GBP! I believe it could have cost less, regarding its condition (some improvements still need to be done!!!) BUT its location is really great. Tube, station, Hyde Park, Sightseeing buses stop just around the corner!!!One Question: Why do hotels need carpeted floors, stairs etc when carpets ALWAYS look dirty ???"
20,1320,"Jun 28 2009 	ONLY RENT IT IF YOU NEED GOOD LOCATION	The reason i stayed on this hotel because my hotel agent, STUDIO 92, didn't make my booking with the hotel i want, so i end up amost sleep on street, thank god this hostel has some room. i cannot said that is hotel but hostel with breakfast. there is no private bathroom for us, so we have to share it with others. however, that is a very big basic bathroom but need some more facility on it. the room is very small, only 1 person can move. it is very hot and humity when you back from your visit. Clean is average, not very bad....at least there is no insect visit us.......there is no lift, so if you don't have big and many luggage, it is ok to stay. We have 3 big luggages, and 3 handbag, and my mom's leg is not good to walk 6 floor stair, so it is a terrible experience. we only stay for 2 night and switch to something else.it is also very noisy area, there are many resturant and bars around and people stay around very late night......if you just want 1 night, good location, it is not that bad, the price for us trible room is $78 pound per night, fair"
21,1320,"Jun 18 2009 	Friendly family	Managed by a friendly and extremely helpful Indian family and staffed by a mix of Polish and Brit workers, the basic B&amp;B hotel scores from the point of view of location and cost, two crucial reasons that drew me to the place, apart from the Indian connection.The location is convenient, in west central London and within a couple of minutes walking distance from the tube station though the sound of the passing trains can be intrusive. As for the tariffs, the starting price of 39 pounds for a single basic room is competitive in frightfully expensive London. But the frugal though clean room is cramped and squeezing into bed is a good work out for the contortionist. Its great if you want to a place to crash at night but for added value and creature comforts, be prepared to lighten your wallet for something more substantial somewhere else."
22,1320,"May 12 2009 	Best choice for spending a nice weekend in London.	Last month my sister and I spent a weekend in London. We chose Tudor Court Hotel to have a place to sleep after doing a lot of sight seeing. ;) We still are very contently with our choice.The rooms are a little bit small, but that is more than ok if you do not plan to spend hours in the hotel. The staff is very, very nice and helpful. You can ask anything and will be helped.Paddington station, from where you can take different tube lines to arrive whereever you want, is in a two-minute-walk just round the corner. There you can also take Heathrow Express or Heathrow Connect to arrive back at the airport when your trip is over, which is very comfortable especially when your plain leaves early in the morning. It takes just 15-25 minutes. Tudor Court Hotel is at Norfolk Square which is a very nice area in London. There you can find a number of pubs and small restaurants and it is a short walk to Hyde Park.All in all I would say, that we chose the right hotel and would choose it again and again, when we decide to visit this beautiful town again."
23,1320,"Apr 19 2009 	All that 3 weary travellers really needed	Tudor Court Hotel is a old-fashioned London B&amp;B which was excellent value for money. Yes the room was small and the decor dated, but the beds were comfortable and clean, there was space to put your cases, good mirrors for getting ready in the morning, a TV, central heating and a tiny but spotlessly clean en-suite. The staff were terrific, especially the ladies who cooked the breakfasts - which were included in the price. The location is excellent, tube around the corner and you can stroll down to Hyde Park. We stayed there twice and would again next time we're in London and just need a place to sleep and shower."
24,1320,"Mar 23 2009 	Really satisfied!!	I went to London for a girly week-end with 2 friends. We just stayed one night in this hotel. We had a triple room en-suite. I was really worried before because the man I got on the phone when I booked was really abrupt and wasn't really answering my questions. When we arrived this man was still abrupt but we appreciated the cleanliness of the whole hotel, our room (one double bed and one single bed) was fine, we had towels with little toiletries on each bed.The bathroom was really small ( not recommended for tall people) but clean.During the night, it's not too noisy (we can still hear what's happening outside) but not completely quiet.The english breakfast was fine, you can ask for more toast or coffee/orange juice. People serving were friendly.We enjoyed our stay and won't hesitate to go back to this hotel which is one minute walk from Paddington station."
25,1320,"Jan 3 2009	friendly stuff	We stayed there for 5 days. It met our expectations, it is a cheap price, three beds to sleep and a bathroom (though shared). The best was the stuff, almost everyone was very kind"
26,1320,"Sep 3 2008 	Too close to the Underground	This hotel is very conveniently close to Paddington station, but the corresponding downside is that you can hear and feel the trains go past. Also, as others have mentioned, the rooms are cramped and shabby."
27,1320,"Aug 1 2008 	""Don't if you can help it...""	This was our first visit to London and it left a sour taste in our mouths. Although location was good for public transport, the rooms were nasty! The bathroom was unreasonably small and had hairy remains from the previous occupants. I felt as if I was taking a shower in a cylindrical hole in the wall. The hallways had a lingering smell of curry. The host was a horrible man. He watched us like a hawk and even had the audacity to rudely question our stay. The host was discriminating - based both on our age and nationality. The hostess tried to rip us off on arrival, asking us to pay for our accommodation again and would not give up until we produced the receipt from our internet transaction. The only good thing about the Tudor Court Hotel is the cleaning/breakfast ladies and the hearty breakfast they served. I hope the ladies find somewhere nicer to work!"
28,1320,"Apr 25 2008 	Basic hotel but great location	We stayed here while on a European trip. We come from Australia so we were used to spacious room. We arrived at the hotel after hours and were checked-in by the hotel manager, and he upgraded our room to one with our own shower because we were staying for 5 nights. A standard room has only a TV and two single beds with a shared toilet and shower down the hall, with a lock that has seen better days. Our upgraded room had a shower and a basin.The safe didnt work and the heating made the room extremely hot and stuffy that we kept the window open all the time in the middle of winter. Find a comfortable temperature was difficult. I felt a bit concerned as to the safety of belongings as our door had a loose lock on it and no working safe meant we had to keep our valuables on us throughout london. The location is fantastic, 50metres from paddington underground station. The hotel is located in norfolk square with a lovely garden in the middle, which you can look onto from your room. this also meant noise was at a minimum. There was many resturants and convenience stores within 100 meters, including a Sainsburys in paddington station.The breakfast is a basic sausage, bacon, egg and beans, which is served with orange juice and toast, we only had this once as it was quite poor qualilty.Overall a great hotel if your only there to sleep and dont mind sharing facilities, but I would definitley upgrade to a shower room."
29,1320,"Mar 27 2008 	Excellent location but....	The location is excellent but I wish the hotel is much better...felt like i had been imprisoned for my stay.Host is unapproachable but seems friendlier to non-Asians. The breakfast ladies are however friendly, cheerful and helpful, hence make the breakfast time bearable.My room doesnt come with toilet/bathroom and it was hell having to go down 2 floors each time as the toilet/bathroom at the floor below has a spolit lock and non-working shower control (only boiling water for bathing!). Though free wireless internet access, but I cant get any access in the room. Ended up sitting on the stairs which I also got company of other guests especially from upper floors who was frustrated at the intermittent or non-existent wireless"
30,1320,"Mar 4 2008 	It is clean and the staff is accomodating but.....	Having checked the reviews on this site, I was not expecting much. I have to agree that if one is expecting American style size and service, the Tudor Court is NOT the place to stay. However, the staff was very kind, the rooms and the hallway accessed shower stall and toilets clean, and the breakfast hot and flavorful. With the American dollar at an all time low, and prices in London being so high, the Tudor is a good value.American visitors best beware of the lack of services that we take for granted and for very low prices we are used to in the U.S.Thank you staff of the Tudor Court."
31,1320,May 10 2007 	Fairly Standard Budget Hotel	While there's nothing particluarly wrong with this hotel there's also nothing particularly outstanding about it either. Transport Links are good and the hotel was clean and tidy but you can do a lot better for your money.
32,1320,"Mar 12 2007	Great location for public transport	I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights in Jan 2007. The immediate area is literally door-to-door hotels so I moved to this hotel after they offered me a good bargain on a double room. They even gave me free access to their wireless internet. They really should publicly offer WiFi as a patron incentive since it basically cost them nothing and the surrounding hotels seem to want to charge for it. Breakfast is only available from 7-9am which is not always convenient. My room was quite nice although they seem to be a bit stingy with towel replacement and soap.The Paddington area is a great place to stay for its transport connections. The tube station and various bus lines are a really short block away. Bus #15 is good to get to many of the popular London attractions. Heathrow Express is also right there.This hotel is far from the finest I've ever stayed at but London nowadays is really expensive (for Americans in particular). I think this hotel offers good basic value for the money. If your really picky about your accommodations, there are other hotels in the area (obviously for more money) that you could choose."
33,1320,"Nov 8 2006 	The worst London hotel ever	This hotel is awful. Stayed for just one night and would never ever stay there again, nor recommend anyone else does.To begin with, we were checked in by some guy dressed in his bath robe and slippers. Then when we got to our room I felt like Harry Potter in a cupboard under the stairs. The entrance to the room, was literally under the stairs and you had to lean to one side to get through the door. I'm aware that properties in London try to fit rooms where ever they can, but this twin room was so small it was ridiculous. Not only that, but it was dirty. The bed covers had stains on and the floor had obviously not been vacuumed recently.The bathroom was about the size of an airplane toilet with a very small space allocated for the share, and that is no exageration.No idea what the breakfast was like as I was deffinately not going to risk it.DON'T STAY HERE!"
34,1320,"Jul 22 2006 	Typical budget hotel but good location	I have stayed at five budget hotels near Paddington Station, and this hotel is typical of the class: The room was dreary and cramped and the furnishings old and tired. However, several things are worth noting: First, the location is terrific. It is on a beautiful leafy square with nicely kept gardens, but it is just around the corner from Paddington with all of its attendant services. Second, the &quot;en suite&quot; bathroom was not just a one-piece fiberglass insert; it actually had free-standing fixtures (such as they were). Third, our room came with a full English breakfast, which I thought was quite good. This place is not for the fastidious, but it isn't a bad choice for the low-budget traveler."
35,1320,"May 10 2006 	Cheap and most definately not cheerful!	I guess with hindsight you get what you pay for! I needed a single room to attend a recruitment fair and what I got was the worst room I have every stayed in. The room was as long as the single bed and I could touch both walls sideways, the sink was broken and &quot;the private shower room situated outside the room&quot; was down two flights of stairs and shared with about ten other rooms (not that I had any trouble getting in there I don't think anyone else was staying in the hotel), oh yes and it was dirty (the room, bathroom and even the bedding). Breakfast was okay but the coffee tasted of smoke! All in all do yourself a favour and book into a Travel Inn or some other low cost chain or alternatively book into a hostel for really cheap accomodation, they can't be any worse than this! I'd also steer clear of any other hotels in this area, from the outside they all look very similar."

Its five minutes walk from the tube, just outside the congestion zone with private parking available at 25 for 24 hours. The room was small but fine for our stay. Service at all times - day and night is excellent and they bring tea and coffee to your room at any time. Great wifi included. We had a room with a balcony which you can order breakfast to the room at no extra cost for continental. Shame it rained while we were there so we couldn't enjoy it to the full. Hotel was very relaxing though. Lovely breakfast conservatory / bar. Very quiet area.Only comment is the rooms could do with more control on temperature. Maybe something they need to invest in.I'd happily stay there again or recommend it"
2,1321,"Nov 6 2009 	A Perfect Weekend Made Even Better!!!!	After being undecided for many day's about where to spend our 2 day's together in London i left the final decision to my fiancee, and luckily for me she decided to book the Pasha Suite at Twenty Nevern Hotel. So, having seen picture's of the Pasha Suite i was very happy that we we're going to be spending the evening together in such a beautiful room after our evening at the o2 arena, so imagine our surprise when we turn up at the hotel only to be told that we have been upgraded to the beautiful Ottoman Suite!!! Decked out in blue's and gold's!!! This room is absolutely beautiful!!! Complete with feature bath in the middle of the room!! (for 2) Lcd tv, freeview, dvd player, radio, ipod docking station, i won't go on with the list but i'll just say that this room has everything for the perfect getaway!!!! We both loved this room so much and came pretty close to barracading ourselves in. On checking out i felt like the Luckiest guy in the world, a night in a beautiful room with my beautiful fiancee........................if only we could stop time!!! Thank you Twenty Nevern Square for making it a weekend never to forget!!!"
3,1321,"Nov 6 2009 	Perfect Room Perfect Heaven!	We arrived at twenty Nevern Square at just before check in time. We booked the Pasha suite and were told upon arrival that we'd been upgraded to the Ottoman suite and all i can say is WOW!! This room is the the perfect place for a romantic break. The room is huge with the highest ceiling ever. A bath (that fits two) in the room in front of the fire is great. There is also a flat screen tv, dvd player, freeview and an ipod docking system. The bathroom is a good size with a big shower and two sinks. You have your own balcony area that overlooks Nevern Square. It has a big bed that is very comfortable. Staff were helpful and friendly. I would definately stay here again without hesitation.If i was recommending this hotel then i'd recommend the Ottoman suite as it is without doubt the best room i have stayed in."
4,1321,"Oct 27 2009 	Very good but some noise problems	This is our second long weekend trip in two years to this hotel. Last year no problems but this year soundproofing was definitely an issue. We stayed in the Ottoman Suite and the screaming child mentioned in older reviews was very audible every night of our three night stay. Also, the creaking floorboards of whomever was staying/living above us were very loud, although thankfully those people did not move around much. The hotel needs to re-invest in soundproofing particularly for their superior/best rooms. People who pay full price for the best room in the hotel are not going to be patient with noise issues. They will spend their money elsewhere. That is the only reason I have downgraded the value as one night's sleep was completely ruined by the child screaming over several hours. A hotel room is essentially a place to sleep and if you cannot sleep all of the amenities/suite comforts count for nothing. We do love this hotel as everything else is pretty perfect: staff, location, room. breakfast etc. I hope they sort the sound issues out before we stay again, it will be the last chance."
5,1321,"Oct 22 2009 	Good location helpful staff	Good location two minutes walk from Earls Court tube. Stayed in luxury room which was a reasonable size, only draw back was that as it is an old building the floors creak which we found out when the guests in the room above ours decided to pace their room most of the night which we could hear due to the loud creaking floorboards. I would stay at this hotel again but it would be on an upper floor and away from the front of the building."
6,1321,"Sep 26 2009 	Special time	I was looking for a good hotel with a good price. When I arrived at 20 Nevern Square I become surprised how good choise I did!!! The Hotel is great, in a beautiful place and so easy party of the city to go anywhere. The people workers are so gently and we really had a great time there!!!!"
7,1321,"Sep 12 2009 	Fantastic hotel - great location and price !	My husband was going to London on business for 3 days so I thought I'd tag along - having never been to london before I didn't want to stay in the usual well known chain hotels. I found 20 Nevern square on late rooms and the price/reviews were excellent, so I booked a 2 night stay in a luxury double room- the nightly rate for the room was an amazing 115 ! my husband wanted me to ring the hotel to check it wasn't per person as he was sure I'd got it wrong ! We arrived at 1.30 and were shown to our room ( no 9) the Japanese Room - this was on the 2nd floor over looking the square at the front. Wooden floors,2 sash windows with beatiful thick drapes and wooden blinds, kingsize bed with lovely bedding and throws, complete with numerous scatter cushions which very very stylishly arranged. All furniture was of a Japanese theme with a large wooden unit which housed the tv, digi box and cd player. The bathroom was all marble with a single shower enclosure and lovely smellies replenished each day - one big plus for me was the bath towels - they were huge and so soft ! A nice touch I thought was the pieces of fruit they leave in your room each day - lovely . We took the continental breakfast each morning in our room ( if ordering the morning just allow them 15 minutes- we just ordered the night before) and we chose a selection of everything - coissants, toast, cereal, cheeses, meats , fresh orange and lovely coffee. The 2nd day we also received museli and cornflakes. You can also have unlimited free coffee and tea - just ring reception and it will be brought up to your room -24hrs.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and we will definalty be staying there again.If it helps - nearest tube in Earls Court - literally take a left as you leave the station then take your next left, walk 100m take your 2nd right and the hotel is on your left - 5 mins walk maximum. Oh and the hotel will also look after your bags when you have checked out."
8,1321,"Sep 1 2009 	Boutique hotel without the pricetag	We booked after reading the good reviews on Tripadvisor and were not disappointed.The hotel is in a lovely old converted townhouse situated on a square with a big communal garden in the centre.Room number 10, a luxury double on the second floor, was comfortably big enough for the two of us (we got a peek of the Pasha suite and that is the room to book if you want a really large room!) with a bed, desk, bedside tables, tv and stereo hidden away in a cupboard, plus a built-in wardrobe with a safe, trouser press and hairdryer. The bathroom was very nice - larger than expected, all in marble with a shower and bathtub, nice toiletries, bathrobes and bottles of mineral water. The queen sized bed was very comfortable. The entire hotel is furnished tastefully, and every room is different! Another thing that gets a big thumbs up is the free wifi in all rooms.The hotel advertises as being 'very tempting' and has big bowls of shiny red apples (and oranges) in the lounge for you to snack on :-). The complimentary roomservice (coffee, tea, hot chocolate, breakfast) is a great touch! We saw lots of baskets being taken upstairs in the morning, but chose to have our breakfast in the glass-roofed diningroom, next to the garden. Continental breakfast is included in the roomprice and consists of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, fruit juices, milk, lovely creamy yoghurt, cereals and muesli, fresh fruit, freshly baked bread rolls, croissants and pain au chocolat, 4 kinds of cheese, 4 kinds of cold meat, honey, jams and marmelade. For 9 extra you can order a full English breakfast but the continental buffet was so good, we didn't bother. Staff is very friendly and helpful.Location is excellent, our room was quiet and looked out on the leafy square, although the restaurants, shops, pubs and tube station of Earls Court road are just around the corner (max. 5 minutes walk).Check their website for special offers - we paid just 89 per night. Excellent value!!"
9,1321,"Aug 13 2009 	Very nice!	Double room was not huge but its London and travelers have to get over the fact that rooms aren't as big as in Canada or the USA. Very well appointed and the bathroom was amazing with his/hers robes. Location is great, short walk to Earl's Court Station which is a great station to connect to most attractions."
10,1321,"Jul 14 2009 	Small But Lovely Little Gem	We stayed at Twenty Nevern Square for 4 nights recently. The location is excellent; 4-5 blocks from the Earls Court tube station, which is on both the Piccadilly and District lines. The hotel was quiet without being inconveniently situated. We arrived before check-in, but were allowed to use the hotel restrooms to change our clothes and drop off our luggage. Our room was fit with a quenn bed for my husband and I, and a single for our small daughter, so our room did feel a little cramped, but we didn't mind. We were out of our room sight-seeing for most of the time we were in London. The continental breakfast was probably the best we had on our entire 3-week trip throughout England and Scotland. The staff was very helpful and no request was too small. I would definitely stay here again and I would certainly recommend Twenty Nevern Square to anyone traveling to London."
11,1321,"Jul 13 2009 	Lovely Boutique Hotel	My wife booked 20 Nevern Square as a Birthday Surprise, we stayed in a Luxury Double room, the room was beautifully designed, a bit small but that is London for you. The colour tones, soft lighting and gorgeous marble bathroom was perfect for the 2 of us. The Continental Breakfast consists of fresh fruit, yoghurts and Pastries. The staff were very friendly and always willing to help, nothing was too much trouble. We will definitely be staying here again."
12,1321,"Jul 8 2009 	The hotel was a highlight of our trip with a wonderful staff location and facility	At the top of the list when reviewing the Twenty Nevern Square would be the excellent staff and the professional, thorough, and caring service they provide. I assume that managers at this hotel screen candidates for their staff with these requirements in mind as everyone on the staff that we met was efficient, friendly and welcoming. Although I wish I had asked for all of their names, I would like to specifically mention Lu-Anne, Chuka, Matthew and Sulai for their superb service. The staff was a definite plus for us! The location of the hotel at Earl's Court is also excellent and only a few minutes walk from the tube. The Earl's Court station includes three major lines, just about all you need to travel directly (with no transfers) from Heathrow Airport to the hotel (about $2.00 in non-peak time after 9:30 a.m.) or from the hotel to all major tourist destinations. The Earl's Court area provides many choices in restaurants and pubs, plus several bakeries and grocery stores. The hotel is located directly across the street from a park, which is a safe, quiet and pretty setting. The rooms are stylishly decorated with helpful amenities, such as a heated towel rack in the bathroom, and the facility is spotlessly clean. The breakfast is excellent with delicious, top-quality fresh fruit each day. It also includes cereals, yogurts, meat and cheese platters, croissants, rolls, pastries, juices, hot chocolate, coffee and tea. Oranges and apples are available throughout the day in the lounge area, and the staff will bring hot chocolate, coffee or tea to your room at any time of day if requested. We stayed for six nights at the Twenty Nevern Square and will definitely return and recommend it to friends. It was delightful!!!"
13,1321,"Jul 6 2009 	Worth a look if staying in the area	My girlfriend and I stayed here for 1 night at the beginning of July.We chose this Hotel because it was a short tube ride to Wimbledon Tennis Club.LocationThe Hotel is a few minutes walk from Earls Court Tube Station.A good base to get to Wimbledon and connect into central London.There are lots of Pubs and restaurants in this area.HotelThe Hotel is a converted town house and looks onto a park in the middle of Nevern Square. It had a small lounge with internet access and small bar / breakfast room. RoomOur room 10 was nice, small but adequate as we wasn't planning on staying in much. The bed was comfortable, there was enough storage for a short stay and was kept clean to a good standard. We looked out onto the park which was nice. There was a TV in the room (not a very good picture), a fan instead of A/C which was much needed, an ironing board &amp; iron and a safe. The bathroom had the usual toiletries, bottled water and dressing gowns.Food &amp; DrinkA continental breakfast was included in our price although you could pay extra for an English breakfast. There were 2 ladies rushing about trying to put fresh food out, clear the tables, wash up, greet the guests, etc. It was a bit manic and un-organised. Having said that it wasnt bad, cheese &amp; ham, rolls, croissants, cereal, tea &amp; coffee, etc.Also instead of tea &amp; coffee making facilities in the rooms, you can dial 0 to reception and order complimentary tea, coffee and hot chocolate. This service is 24 hours which I thought was very good.StaffAll the Staff we met were very friendly and pleased to help. OverallIf like us you need to stay in this area and fancy something with a bit more character and personality than a travel lodge, pay the extra 10/20 to stay at 20 Nevern Square."
14,1321,"Jul 3 2009 	GREAT	Stayed with colleagues for a conference in London, the hotel is perfect in every way, free wireless connection, lovely rooms, I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a Luxury Room.The Breakfast was fresh and tasty, the staff all friendly. We will be booking again."
15,1321,"Jun 23 2009 	Small but well managed	We spent 4 nights in this hotel last week. The location is nice, a few blocks from the Earls Court station and near Old Brompton Road which has some good restaurants and pubs. I was initially concerned that our room was in the basement. It was small but well equipped. It had a comfortable bed and a fantastic shower. The continental breakfast was simple but fine and it was served in a very sunny room. The staff were very helpful with requests and queries. This place is neither a cookie cutter chain hotel nor a blemish-free boutique hotel, but it was well maintained and comfortable. The service and the location are both very good. It is appropriately priced for what it provides. I'd stay here again."
16,1321,"Jun 13 2009 	Awful Hotel - never again!	Situated in between noisy Earls Court Road and Warwick Road in a garden square is the best bit. It spiralls hopelessly downhill after that. My wife checked in earlier than me (I was a few hours behind) with colleagues for a weekend seminar being held in the area. The first room offered was so small she had to shuffle around the bed sideways to get anywhere and the bed certainly was not big enough for two. The staff offered to change the room (which wasn't ready) and she had to go and register at the seminar and was told she could collect the key on her return in the early evening. We returned and were given a key and instructions on how to get to our room (room 23), the three doorways we ended in front of weren't numbered and looked rather like storage area doors, but the desk clerk returned with us and seemed surprised that these rooms weren't numbered and showed us in the room. We were right on first impressions, these WERE storage rooms, but cleared out and a bed, TV and bathroom squeezed into the space. I wondered how small the first room offered was, as you could have possibly touched wall to wall with two people's outstretched arms. The bed was a double only in the fact that the two of us could lie down side by side! The bed itself had sheets and a well used blanket (complete with somebody else's hair on it). I travel with electric razor and toothbrush and looked for sockets to plug them in, and couldn't find anything in the bathroom, so I checked the dog eared computer printouts in the &quot;Information pack&quot;, silly me! I had missed them as they were apparently right by the shaving mirror light, I looked again, no mirror, no light and no electric socket. There was a bidet in the bathroom, so you could wash but not brush! I checked the wonderful &quot;information pack&quot; a bit more, which also told me that sheets would be changed every three days (hinting at an eco guilt trip) and I would find a bag for dry cleaning (but they hide it so well - maybe it was next to the shaver point, you know, the one by the non existent mirror and light!).The small bed slid across the floor if any weight was put against it. There was a TV and Sky viewing box on a shelf with pieces falling off it at the end of the bed, we didn't turn it on, we didn't need to, the walls and ceiling were so thin, we got to enjoy everyone else's TV noise!The hand out said there would be &quot;..soft towelling robes and marbled bathing rooms..&quot; and ..&quot;the difference is in the detail..&quot;the robes were towelling and the room was meant for bathing, but SOFT and MARBLE there wasn't! the detail? oh yes, a &quot;double&quot; room with a gift of ONE apple, on ONE plate! (not even a knife to cut it so we could share!) A suitcase stand folded in the wardrobe, useless, as there was not enough room to put it up. A hairdryer in the wardrobe next to an unlit mirror with a lead so short, my wife had to virtually sit in the wardrobe to use it! The mirrors in the batroom with the edges falling off,. The shower, surprisingly did work, but the screen wall was not very big and any sudden movement meant that water bounced off me onto the floor. Detail? the painter in the bathroom had also kindly painted parts of the woodwork and tiles the same colour as the walls! Room service? if you like sandwiches or pies and high priced drinks you will be well looked after! A double room with only one chair and a bed so narrow and hard it could have been a mortuary slab - I expected to wake up with someone in a white coat with a scalple hovering nearby!Breakfast - I knew it would be a bad morning when we had to walk round the empty frozen food baxes in the corridor leading to the cafe/restuarant. Continental breakfast is included, but cooked apparently takes 30 minutes and costs 9 supplement. The usual basic muesli and packet cereals and frozen pastries. We asked for coffee and Earl Grey tea (my wife eventually kindly showed the waiter which tea was Earl Grey) he managed to make the tea undrinkable and really strong, my coffee, on the other hand, was too weak to defend itself! The service was beyond a joke, dirty plates on grubby tables only grudgingly moved when someone had the audacity to sit at one of them. A colleague kept reminding the wait staff that she was still waiting for an order of toast after nearly and hour - other diners took pity on her and offered her some of theirs! I watched pots of beverages being served without cups to drink from. Coffee being offered and called hot chocolate. The service (or rather, lack of it!) was commented upon and a staff member considerately said it was becuase &quot;they were busy&quot;) NO (-----) SHERLOCK!, it was Saturday morning in a hotel in London, nobody thought that guests who had checked in would be impertinent enough to want breakfast in the morning! Oh ye!, they don't seem to have a dishwasher with the nice hot sterilising rinse at the end, they wash up everything - glasses, cups, cereal bowls and greasy breakfast plates in a small sink behind the bar and dry everything with one tea towel!We had booked for two nights, but decided that one was enough, and packed and tried to check out, the guy on the desk didn't believe us and called a colleague to ask if this was possible, after some debate it was decided that we could have our freedom and we escaped into the morning sunshine! As I said - AWFUL HOTEL - NEVER AGAIN! I had to give this hotel one mark, I think it deserves none, but I can't place this review without a mark!"
17,1321,"Jun 4 2009 	Nice hotel but stay away from Room 21 (Mezzaine Room)	The plus side: friendly, helpful staff, nice breakfast room with good quality food, clean, fairly well decorated/furnished, convenient location.The minus side: our room (room 21, the Mezzanine) was a death trap. How the local authorities allowed this room to be occupied by the public is puzzling. The entrance to the room is the lower portion of a two-level room which has the bathroom and a sitting area. The room is deceptively attractive. An incredibly steep stairway leads to the upper level. The stairway treads are so short that they allow about one third of your foot to contact the treads. The only way to ascend is by twisting your feet to the side while ascending. The upper level has the bed and associated furnishings. The ceiling height in the bedroom area is about 5 feet 10 inches and has a beam which crosses the center of the room at 4 feet 10 inches. Anyone taller than 5'10&quot; cannot stand up and anyone taller than a dwarf had better remember to duck under the beam. I forgot one time and hit my head hard enough that I considered whether I needed medical attention. Of course, any trip under the beam and down the stairs to the bathroom during the night was death-defying. The ceiling height in the shower is about 5'10&quot; as well. Such a room would never be allowed in the U.S. where it would not meet building codes. It's a shame because the hotel was otherwise very nice."
18,1321,"May 27 2009 	A great location in a small but very comfortable hotel nothing is too much trouble.	The hotel was described as a 'Townhouse Hotel' and was admittedly small but the room was exquisitely furnished with high quality decor &amp; fittings. There was a comfortable lounge on the ground floor &amp; an airy conservatory where meals were served as well as a small bar area. Located just minutes from Earl's Court yet in a peaceful square setting, the location could't have been better."
19,1321,"May 20 2009 	Great little find...	This is a gem of a place and just around the corner from Earl's Court tube station (Warwick Road exit)The staff are very friendly and the rooms small, but very comfortable.Breakfast was also great and generally enjoyed the stay - will be staying again as I'm often in London on business."
20,1321,"Apr 19 2009 	A Hidden Jewel	Arrived Heathrow at 4.45am after 23hrs flying time. First trip to UK. The theory was to drop bags and 'explore' London. Exhaustion and the shock of cooler weather made this extremely hard. We weren't due to book in till 2pm! The staff were wonderful. They provided warmth, comfort and coffee till a room was vacated and made up for us by 10am.The room was amazing. Four poster bed, dimmer switch for lighting, hot shower and quiet location. Woke after 19hrs sleep and enjoyed toasted sandwiches in bed (room service). Stayed 3 nights. Location to tube station and Earls Court made getting around easy. Buffet breakfast was amazing. Staff were all friendly and very helpful."
21,1321,"Apr 7 2009 	WARNING:PLUMBING Problem	I made reservation 2 times for each 1 night at 20 Nevern Square in 2008. Unfortunately, I always had bad experience with this hotel. I was moved 2 times to other substandard hotel due to PLUMBING problem. 1st time they phoned me. Second time I arrived at the hotel without being informed and there was same problem which is PLUMBING. I was really annoyed by the hotel by handling my reservation. Come on how can you have same problem 2 times of my different stays? It is really ridiculous. I requested at least to see my bedroom since there was plumbing problem in the bathroom as I assumed there was no problem with bedroom but I was told by hotel crew that I could not go to the bedroom as well as the bathroom. I suspected they were overbooked and did not have room for me to stay, therefore they moved my reservations to Mayflower hotel. and the Mayflower hotel is absolutely disaster.I felt like I was cheated by the hotel. I informed the hotel staff about what I thought. I will never stay this hotel again. Whoever is going to stay there please beware of PLUMBING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
22,1321,"Mar 31 2009 	Last Minute Trip good find	I booked the hotel for a last minute trip for a concert at Earl's Court. The hotel was nice, with an adequate breakfast but my room was VERY small even by European standards. But I was there solo and without much luggage so it was fine. The staff were very friendly and accomodated my needs with medication that had to be refrigerated. A good experience."
23,1321,"Mar 26 2009 	Amazing Hotel !	I recently stayed at Twenty Nevern Square with my girlfriend for a special treat - I booked a Luxury Four Poster Room directly with the hotel - the quickness of the response from the staff was fantastic and made booking via email very easy  the afternoon receptionist was fantastic when I called up to check if everything was ok (even though the hotel did send me a confirmation email). I like double checking everything I do especially when it comes to an evening at a hotel with my Mrs. I Informed the receptionists that I would like a few special surprises in the room for my girlfriend  some champagne, flowers and chocolate the hotel took my budget and organised everything else from there. We arrived at the hotel at around 1PM and we were accommodated by the lovely girl at the front desk who informed us our room we were ready early and that the manager had given us an upgrade (booking directly helps with free upgrades according to the manager). We were shown to our room by a lovely porter named chuka who was very courteous and showed us to our room. When we entered the room  I think the word gob smacked describes the room it was the ottoman suite  according to my girlfriend the most gorgeous colour combination with turquoise and gold. The pieste de rsistance was the Victorian bathtub in the room set by the marble fire place and chandelier over the top this was amazing. The room also had an amazing view of the square with our own private terrace (which was great for me as I am a smoker). Inside the room my girlfriend was very happy to see champagne on ice flowers and chocolates (scored me many brownie points). In the evening we went down to reception and I was met by a very friendly face in Matthew who helped me sort out a table at mint leaf and organise a car to pick us up very efficient service. That evening we left for dinner (not really wanting to leave the 42inch plasma and DVD player) and made our way to the restaurant our car was outside an S-Class Mercedes Benz (if this is what there friends carry the guests around its not half bad  the driver was fully licensed and even had a pricing list in the back of the car). We came back to the hotel had some hot chocolate sent up and relaxed the night away.We enjoyed breakfast in bed  the saddest part of the stay was that I only booked one night wished we could have stayed there forever it was truly an amazing experience and will definitely return to this gem of a hotel. All the staff was fantastic and I will definitely be returning to Twenty Nevern Square."

25,1321,"Mar 23 2009 	Great location!	The location of this hotel was wonderful, close to the Tube and restaurants. The neighborhood felt very safe and the staff was extremely helpful. I stayed in a luxury double and being forewarned about the size of London hotel rooms was pleasantly surprised. The room was nicely heated. The bathtub/shower combination had no shower curtain or door so made a small puddle in the bathroom. The continental breakfast was a very good combination of fruit, cheese, cold meats, granolas, bread, pastries, and yogurts with juice, coffee, and tea...more than enough to start the day. You can also get the continental breakfast delivered to the room for free. One thing is that payment either cash or with credit card is needed at checkin."
26,1321,"Mar 20 2009 	Great experience	I really liked this hotel, it's small but personal with a great location (just a few minutes from Earl's Court Tube). The staff were very friendly and professional, the room was clean and newly furnished. We were in the Mezzanine Room which was quiet and more spacious than expected, although not recommended for very tall people (!) Great value for money, especially considering that breakfast, which had a good selection, was also included in the price."
27,1321,"Feb 23 2009 	Watch Out - You Could Get Duped Too	Yes, there are some good reviews of this hotel by people who were lucky enough to avoid the pitfalls but for many of us who have reviewed this hotel our credit cards were illegally charged by the dishonest management.After reading reviews of 20 Nevern, I thought it would be a lovely place to stay. I did note the bad reviews by people who were shifted to the Mayflower hotel but armed with that info I thought nothing could go wrong. Not so.I booked months in advance with a credit card that was later bought out by another company rendering the original card useless. While away on my trip, I checked my email to find that they needed new credit info and to respond within 24 hours in order to keep my booking. So I did. The following day I rec'd a call from Baggi who said I no longer had a room. I asked him why since I sent my info as requested. He said he would put me in the Mayflower Hotel. I immediately said &quot;No Way.&quot; I read the bad reviews and wasn't going to fall into their trap. When I told him no, Baggi said &quot;Well come in on Monday and we will try to get you a room at 20 Nevern.&quot; On Monday, I arrived at the hotel to see if they could find a room and the young man said no but they would put me in the Mayflower. Again, I said &quot;No Way&quot; and asked him to credit my credit card which he refused to do. I left and spent an hour or two finding a new hotel and figured I would take care of this problem when I arrived home.I contacted booking.com immediately upon return but they were not very interested in helping. They received a response from Sulai the manager of 20 Nevern in which he stated &quot;we were perplexed when the customer arrived at the hotel.&quot;I contacted my credit card company to dispute the transaction. It was taken off my credit card. Last week I rec'd a letter from my credit card company that the dispute was reopened. It included a letter from Sulai racked with lies and misinformation. This time he stated &quot;The customer never showed up to the hotel&quot;. Did I show up or didn't I?????Long story, longer. Unfortunately, I rec'd the letter from the credit card company on Feb.13th and was asked to respond by Feb. 12th or the case would be closed. With no chance to dispute the charges the only thing I can do is warn others of this practice. Before you book this hotel, read the reviews from worst to best. You will see others who have been illegally charged. Then look at the reviews for the Mayflower and you will see a similar game. The hotel also has a taxi scam. Instead of calling a registered taxi company they call their &quot;associates&quot; who charge their customers double the cost to ride them around London.When I read Trip Advisor reviews I take the negative reviews with a grain of salt figuring that there are some people who can never be pleased. I am one of the most easy going people but seeing how many people were duped by this hotel I had to write and warn my fellow travelers.Don't be surprised if you see a response from Sulai saying I am delusional or whatever he wants to call it. I have noticed many of his responses to internet complaints that he writes off as another crazy customer. After awhile all these &quot;crazy customers&quot; will catch up with him."
28,1321,"Jan 26 2009 	I knew it would be great and it was.	This was my second stay at the Twenty Nevern Square and I was not disappointed. I had booked a luxury double contacting the hotel directly. I exchanged a few emails with Mr Sulai and never had to wait long to hear back. I requested a room with a view and was assigned room 9 on the second floor, with a view of the square. The room wasn't big but I was travelling alone and it was big enough for me. I suppose it could be a bit small for two people with a lot of luggage, but then again I prefer cleanliness over size, and the room was spotless. The bathroom (with toilet, sink, shower) was small, but spotless, like the room. It was a bit too hot, I must admit, so I often had to open the window but that wasn't a big problem - I noticed pretty much everywhere else I went to, be it shops, galleries or wherever, was a bit too warm for my taste so I guess that's what the majority expects. The complimentary WiFi connection worked perfectly, I had breakfast brought to my room every morning perfectly on time and both reception staff and waiting staff were very nice and polite. The hotel rooms do not have tea/coffee facilities (i.e. kettle!) and I did miss that a bit, but you can call the reception and have a drink brought to your room any time at no charge.The location is great, there are two large supermarkets that are open 24/7 within walking distance, the Tube is just a couple of minutes away, and so is the post office, banks, pubs, restaurants and take-aways, chemist, etc.I stayed at a much bigger hotel later on during my trip but I preferred the Twenty Nevern Square because service seemed a lot more personal."
29,1321,"Dec 17 2008 	A Nice Weekend	The room was on the small side but nicely decorated to a high standard and clean. The walls were quite thin.The location is quiet, but very close to the Tube.WiFi and breakfast were included at no extra charge.The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. They gave us good advice about parking nearby that saved us a good bit of money."
30,1321,"Nov 18 2008 	Beautiful Hotel	Celebrated our 5th Wedding Anniversary on Saturday 15th Nov. 2008Located about a 3 minute walk from Earls Court tube station.Beautiful, charming room with 4 poster bed (Room 1)Food was absolutely yummy (Breakfast in bed)Free tea &amp; coffee on demandStaff were very friendly, helpful and made us feel so welcome.Would definitely stay here again and can really recommend this hotel10 out of 10"
31,1321,"Oct 31 2008 	Wonderful small hotel in London	We spent two nights at this small, boutique hotel in Earls Court. It is a short 5-10 minute walk from the Earls Court underground station on busy Earls Court Road which also has a good selection of restaurants. The hotel is in a very quiet, residential square and is a real gem. Our room, as we expected in London, was very small but beautifully decorated and very comfortable. We were in &quot;The Conservatory&quot; - two twin beds and a great little sitting area with a small but very nice bathroom. Very clean and the staff was welcoming, friendly and helpful. Breakfast was wonderful and the breakfast room at the hotel was great - nice place to relax and enjoy the morning. For London, the price was good and Earls Court is not too far from many London attractions. We highly recommend this hotel and are looking forward to returning there."
32,1321,"Oct 6 2008 	Fine for what it is	I booked a luxury double at 20 Nevern Square based on reviews from Tripadvisor. I stayed for four nights from 23 September 2008. The hotel is well located, being a short walk from the Earl's Court tube station, which links directly to Heathrow. Earl's Court Rd also has all the facilities you would need, including pubs, restaurants, several small supermarkets, internet outlet, post office etc. There is a large 24hour Tesco's supermarket within 8 minutes walk as well.I was somewhat disappointed with the room. I had Room 12, which was certainly small (although I expected this based on previous reviews aand previous experience with London hotels), however my main problem was that, rather than being a double, it had two twin beds pushed together. I like having room to stretch out which is why I booked a double. Two twin beds together are not a double, they are very uncomfortable unless you simply sleep in one of the singles. Not happy with this.I would also caution about the heat (an odd thing for London, I know!). When I was there the maximum daily temps were in the range of 18-21C. The room was quite warm. The only cooling available was a small fan or an open window. While this sufficed, I think the room would be unbearable in warmer temperatures.I also could not access the hotel's wifi Internet. This may have been a problem with my laptop, but I have not had this problem elsewhere. If you do wish to access the Internet, and don't have your own laptop, I would not use the hotel's computer - the keyboard is really bad and the cost is twice that of the Internet available on Earl's Court Rd (where it was 1 pound for an hour)."
33,1321,"Sep 8 2008 	Brilliant	We booked a luxury double directly through the hotel for 109 pounds. There were some specials advertised on the website, but we were told these weren't available for September, which was a little annoying since the website did not limit them to any month in particular.However, when we got there they upgraded us for free to the Pasha suite at their initiative. As many others have written, it was very charming. The service in the hotel was impeccable.Our only regret was that we had to leave."
34,1321,"Sep 1 2008 	Great place to stay in central London	I stayed in a twin room in June. Yes the room was small, but it was perfectly adequate for a two night trip to go to Wimbledon. The staff were extremely courteous, friendly and helpful. The decor and ambience was very warm and welcoming. While tea and coffee making facilities were not available in the room the staff were more than willing to make a pot of tea or coffee for us at any time in the downstairs lounge. The hotel was very convenient to the tube, for both Heathrow and Wimbledon. It was also only a 10 minute walk to High St Kensington for the obligatory shopping trip. Its in a nice area, which we found to be very quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who intends to spend a few days in London."
35,1321,"Aug 16 2008 	Lovely Hotel	Stayed in a twin room for 3 night in early July 2008. Lovely decor in twin room (which was small, however this was not unexpected). The bathroom was impeccably clean and the ammenities were very nice. Only problem with bathroom was sensor light which went off halfway through my shower one morning. Room was incredibly hot, even with fan on full and window open, I actually went out without a jacket one day (because room was so hot) and was freezing.Indulged in hot chocolate delivered to our room after coming home one night, which was lovely. Buffet breakfast was also good with lots of variety and the staff in breakfast room very attentive.Other than the heat only negative was one night when I was trying to receive a very important phone call from home the phone disconnected twice after about 20 seconds and when I called reception to report the problem and request that the phone be changed over was met with a laugh and told they had no other phones. Eventually on the 3rd try my call stayed connected.Lovely well located place to stay."
36,1321,"Jul 28 2008 	Teeny Weeny!	This little hotel is charming and set in a nice quiet square but within walking distance of restuarants and bars. Handy for subway too.It was clean and the reception staff were nice. Lots of hot water and a good standard of fixtures and fittings. Free toilettries v nice.No Tea/ coffee making facilities in room but bottled water provided.Breakfast was basic but the setting was nice (albeit a small room) and it was fine.My real issue was with the size of my room. It was absolutely tiny. This was made worse by the fact that they had crammed a queen size bed, a chair, a bedside unit and two small tables in! The result was a claustrophobic nightmare - a room where you could only shuffle past the bed to get to the en suite (which was so small that there was nowhere to put toilettries and the door could not open fully into the room.) There was no more than 12 inches to spare around the edge of the room and once all the cushions and throws etc were off the bed you couldn't get near the window! You couldn't actually sit in the chair and the only way to watch the TV was lying on the bed. (Remote didn't work.)The heavy curtains made the room very dark but a fan was provided to help the air circulate.There was no place to put anything and if you were staying more than a night you would seriously struggle. The drawers in the bedside cabinet were too small for even my modest underwear and I couldn't open them anyway because of all the cushions etc off the bed had been folded up there. The wardrobe was a teeny closet which contained spare blankets, the hairdryer and trouser press along with the safe and so you really couldn't hang anything in it. The mirror was on the back of the closet door and set at a height for midgets.My overall feeling was that I had stepped through the looking glass!! At only 5 foot 5 I was really struggling not to feel like Gulliver! Men or tall women? Forget it!Seriously - I paid 90 a night for these very cramped conditions - not value for money but then that is London Hotels for you! It was clean and I would consider going back but only if I was guaranteed a room that I could actually stand up in!"
37,1321,"Jul 27 2008 	Lovely small hotel	We were a group of four friends who stayed at Twenty Nevern Square for a long weekend in December 2007. It's a lovely hotel, a short walk from Earl's Court tube station. The rooms are very nice and a continental breakfast was included in our room rate. The only thing we didn't like was that the beds had blankets instead of duvets, but this is just a minor complaint. We'd recommend this hotel to others who are going to London and would very likely return ourselves on a future visit to the city."
38,1321,"Jul 21 2008 	Nice	Very convenient location : safe area + tube just around the corner (district, circle, piccadilly). Room was tiny but that's how it goes in London and the bathroom was quite spacious and clean. We had lots of wardrobe space in the room, so we stored the luggage in there and had enough space to walk around the bed. Flatscreen TV, CD- and DVD player available in the room. Breakfast (cereals, cold cuts, cheese, fruits) was good, although I'd prefer cooked english breakfast when I'm in London.All in all, a good experience."
39,1321,"Jul 9 2008 	What A Gem!	Wow, what a gem of a hotel this is!I stayed with my husband, my sister and two teenage nephews at this hotel on the 2nd of July.On arrival the hotel came out promptly and took my husband and brother in law to park the car at the designated parking (25 for 24hr's).The concierge then carried our cases in and took them to our rooms while we signed in. The front of staff, a lovely lady from Bottswana (Sorry if I got that wrong) welcomed us and arranged everything to make our stay pleasent. The hotel met our requests to be near the children too.We stayed in room 6 (luxery double)The rooms are amazing, beautiful fabrics, bed linnen, soft furnishings and marble bathrooms. The bathroom was well stocked with towels and they had lovely toiletries too that aren't just bog standard. The bathroom was spotless and the shower was hot and powerful.The bedroom was just stunning with beautiful lamps and was well thought out. It had a cabinet that housed TV with Free view, DVD and CD player. There was lots of storage for clothes, a trouser press and a fantastic powerful hairdryer. It wasn't one of those weird things that is stuck to the wall and that you can't manouver very well!When we arrived back late at night, the bed had been beautifully turned down ready for us to slip into, I thought that this was a lovely touch.Tea, coffee and hot chocolate are free during your stay and you can have this served in your room 24hrs with no extra charge.Breakfast was the best continental breakfast I have ever had, lovely cheeses, no plastic cheese in sight, quality yogurts and cerial and freshe bakery items. As much tea, coffee and juice as you wanted. You can have this served in your room if you wish at no extra cost. We prefered to go to the very pleasent breakfast room. The ladies who serve the breakfast are very helpful and really look after every detail.This hotel is close to the tube at Earls Court but far enough down the road to be quiet. I can't recommend it enough, I wanted to revisit in October with my children 9 &amp; 6 years but sadly they can only accommodate 1 child in the room. They have recommended their sister hotel The Linden. If it is anything like this one we will have a great stay!"
40,1321,"Jun 26 2008	Great stay	Stayed at NSQ20 in June on bussiness had a fantstic stay, the satff were freindly, room was perfect and had a great breakfast."
41,1321,"Jun 25 2008 	Roomless Room	The staff was very nice, but the hotel is a converted town house, so many of the rooms are extremely tiny. I should have read the fine print more closely to see that the deluxe double and the four poster deluxe double were not at all the same thing. Also I should have requested a room with actual standing room. As it was, we had to live out of our suitcases since there was no place to put anything without making living there impossible. I would recommend the hotel, but you should get the larger rooms if you can."
42,1321,"Jun 4 2008 	Nice hotel great staff	We stayed in a luxury double for 4 nights at the end of May 2008. The room was nicely furnished and overlooked the square. The square is beautiful and peaceful. The hotel is close to the Earl's Court tube station and in a quiet and safe neighborhood. There are plenty of reasonably priced restaurants and pubs on Earl's Court Road. The breakfast room is bright, sunny and comfortable. The breakfast is a wonderful assortment of fresh fruit, yogurts, cereals, cheeses, meats and breakfast rolls and pastries. This is a nice change from the roll and cereal of other hotels in this price range!The best part of this gem of a hotel is the staff. They are pleasant, helpful and cheerful. I will definitely stay here again!"
43,1321,"Jun 4 2008 	Very pleasant	Located at Earl's Court at the outskirts of Zone 1 is this very pleasant little hotel. The hotel itself is a short 5 minute walk from the Tube station and is located on a quite street off the main road and facing a very pleasant private garden / square. Earl's Court Tube station is on the Circle Line as well as the Picadilly Line which means that Soho, Convent Garden and Oxford Street are easy to get to.The staff were efficient and courteous. The room was of a good size (especially for London and the price). The price was reasonable. Breakfast was good and was served in a nice dining area with a fabulous skylight.There is no cable but there is a dvd player and radio/hifi in the room. Wifi is also provided but it was very weak in our room (on the 2nd floor).Every room in the hotel is different. Ours was the Mezzanine Suite. As the name suggests, the room was built in such a way that the bed room was on a different level from the main entrance and the toilet. The design meant that there was more space in the room. However, it also meant that the bedroom had a fairly low ceiling and that we had to climb up and down a fairly steep and narrow flight of stairs every day. Also, the lights switches were not well designed and the main lights could not be switched off from the bed.Overall, we liked this hotel. It was very clean and well maintained. It was great value for money and coming back every night was a pleasure. we must however caution that some of the rooms did appear to be rather small.ps. We booked the hotel directly from the hotel website. The hotel was quick to reply and booking the hotel (through emails) was a painless and pleasant experience."
44,1321,"Apr 20 2008 	Great little place	With the current USD to GBP exchange rate, there is no such thing as a cheap place to stay in London. Add to that the crap shoot of booking a place sight unseen and the range of reviews you can read for any hotel - even TripAdvisor can only allay so many fears.I am happy to report, however, that Twenty Nevern Square is a gem of a place to stay in London. Through one of their specials, I booked a luxury double; they put me in the Chinese double, a lovely room overlooking the square, quiet and comfortable. As expected, the room was small; having traveled and lived abroad, I didn't expect - or need - American expansiveness, and they have used the space to good effect: a massive dresser and roomy closet provide plenty of storage, a small table provides a place to work or eat. The bathroom was also economical but provided quite enough room and plenty of towels; the shower was powerful and the hot water was plentiful.Because I was running late, I asked for breakfast to be delivered to my room - one of the complimentary perks. Continental breakfasts usually consists of a bowl of museli, a dry croissant and some jam; my tray offered a small selection of meat and cheese, two kinds of yogurt, museli, fresh fruit, three types of pastry, jam, milk, juice and tea - all very tasty.The staff I encountered were both pleasant and helpful. The gentleman on night duty located an extension cord for me so I could plug my Mac into the (too low to the floor) outlet; my breakfast arrived promptly and with a smile; the porter carried my suitcase to the curb for me when I left that morning. Earl's Court is also a good location. Two tube stops are within minutes of the hotel; buses are frequent; taxis abound. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance if you'd like to stay local for an evening meal.I'm aware there are more luxurious places to stay in London and I know there are less expensive hotels. I was very pleased with my stay at Twenty Nevern, however, and as the budget allows, I plan to return."
45,1321,Apr 11 2008 	wonderful	Second time I've stayed here this time I shared with my cousin so we got a twin room for 6 nights was wonderful. we stayed the same time as the brit awards which were just around the corner so hotel was booked out but it was still quiet. one night we could hear a noisy washing machine upstairs we rang reception who tryed to find were noise was coming from aft'er they found it was coming from a privatly owned flat they couldn't do anything but this happened onced and they did try to fix it what more could you ask for . great breakfast hot chocolates on demand boy what a great time we had and we will be staying there again next year best hotel for the price room was alway clean didnt matter what time you left when you came back it was clean staff very friendly too great hotel ........
46,1321,"Apr 7 2008 	Really very impressed...	I was planning on staying in London for 2 days on my own so I wanted to get a hotel that would be in a decent area and that would look after me (I'm such a girl!). Having found relatively good reviews of 20 Nevern Square I contacted them and booked a luxury double (as it was all they had left) at a better rate than I had seen advertised online. I arrived at the hotel just after 9am and was told that my room would be ready in half an hour if I chose to wait - this has never happened in any other hotel I've ever stayed in. I decided to head on and upon my return I found my bag had been put in my room. This was a nice touch. The room was on the 3rd floor and looked out over the square which was great. It was compact and at first sight I thought the bathroom (shower room really) was too small. If my husband (6'6'' tall and built like a truck) had been staying it would have been a bit cramped for him. As I'm normal-sized it suited me - the only thing I can say about the room is that the end of the bed was carved and I kept walking into bits of it. However, when I returned after dinner they'd turned down my sheets and I spent a very comfortable night there. I'd ordered a hot chocolate which was divine and probably helped!Breakfast was lovely and the staff were fantastic. They really couldn't have been more helpful - especially when (idiot that I am) I left my phone charger there. As I type it is winging its way to Northern Ireland courtesy of the hotel. I was able to leave my luggage at the hotel until I needed to go to the airport and I really appreciated this.All in all I'd recommend this place highly - I'll be using it again myself. And next time I might just bring my husband!!"
47,1321,"Apr 7 2008 	A room with a view...	Twenty Nevern Square is ideally situated for Earls Court and the West End of London. It's a beautiful building overlooking a fabulous garden square. We stayed in the Pasha Suite and it's a very nice room, although it's starting to look and feel a little worn around the edges. Service was good on arrival, although it's a bit odd being asked to pay for your room before you've stayed in it - perhaps I'm being old fashioned? Breakfast was included in the room rate (unusual for London) and was ok as far as continental breakfasts go - though the museli was pretty stale. This is an ok 'boutique' style hotel, not the best we've stayed in, but was a good option for a weekend away."
48,1321,"Mar 10 2008	Just O.K.	It makes you wonder in what other hotels stayed the people who are so excited about this hotel. It gives fair value for money in London standards but nothing more. The bathroom was tiny and uncomfortable. The room small with hardly any storage room. The overall maintenance isn't very good- a door that opens with difficulty, a remote control who works poorly, etc. It's true there's a carved wooden board above the bed but to me it takes a little more then that to create a chinese theme to a room. All in all it's o.k. and the location is good but if it wasn't in central London nobody would have bothered."
49,1321,"Mar 8 2008 	Wonderful Ottoman Suite	Took ages to try and find the perfect hotel for a romantic evening in London. The key considerations were size of room and quietness. I called Twenty Nevern Square to book the Pasha Suite which looked lovely on their website. Had a lovely conversation with Baggi on reception who recommended their brand new Ottoman Suite, about 20 pounds more. To joke with the people who answer the phone seemed to me a good start, so I took his advice, on condition I would seek him out should it not live up to expectations... Did not have to! The suite was fabulous, an enormous room, huge bed, three sets of French windows leading to a sweet balcony overlooking the square (altho latter not much use in rainy feb) luxurious fabrics in gold and blue, a lovely marble fireplace, and the piece de resistance, a free standing, claw footed bath tub in the actual bedroom in front of the fireplace. Well equipped with DVD player, flat screen TV, radio and thing to put your ipod in. As my boyfriend arrived very late after a train delay, missing our restaurant reservation, I popped down to the 24 hour Tesco, and we had a lovely picnic in our room. The staff were all very friendly. The only downside which is nothing to do with the hotel is that the District Line to Earls Court is not running at the moment, so we spent a bit more on taxis than normal, but was small issue, and there are plenty of great places within walking distance. It seems from other reviews on this site that some of their rooms are a bit small, but this suite is very special and wonderful value.CH, Dublin, Feb 2008"
50,1321,"Mar 7 2008	Excellent	Finding a reasonably priced hotel in Central London can be a bit 'hit and miss'. More miss than hit usually. I'm happy to report that 20 Nevern Square is excellent. I booked direct with the hotel after checking the online price with one of the discount websites. The hotel offered a fractionally better rate.Be aware that there are some smaller/cheaper standard rooms upstairs but we booked a luxury double for 99GBP and it was very good. Not huge but well furnished and appointed with a good bathroom. It opened out onto the basement courtyard.The included continental breakfast was a cut above the average. Hot beverages during the stay were free and there was no extra charge if you wanted breakfast in your room.All in all a well located little haven. Complaints? None really but if I were to be super picky the breakfast croissants were a tad sweet and the juice was not freshly squeezed - but this is being very critical. The breakfast was still way ahead of most included hotel continental breakfasts.The staff were pleasant and the hotel well furnished and maintained. It's not 'brain surgery' but it's amazing to see how many hotels fail to keep up standards, becoming shabby in a few months. If you can get a luxury room here for under 100GBP it is the best hotel value in London, period."
51,1321,"Mar 7 2008 	Beautiful room!	I was looking for a Four Poster room to stay in with my boyfriend for his birthday last month. The hotel said they didn't have any available but that the Ottoman Suite was. I booked it for 150 pounds inclusive of breakfast. I got there before check in but the room was ready!The room was BEAUTIFUL. We lit the fireplace, the bathtub was amazing and easily fit two people. We had breakfast and champagne on the balcony and definitely enjoyed our stay. Anything of this quality would cost MUCH much more in London. The only downside was that there was a bit of noise (sounded like a blender or a vacuum?) in the middle of the night. But, my boyfriend was slightly bothered by it. I, however, sleep through anything! In short, would definitely stay here again. x"
52,1321,"Feb 18 2008 	Different friendly and good value	I've stayed at Twenty Nevern Square twice, and I would defintiely recommend it. It's beautifully and unusually decorated and even the standard rooms feel quite luxurious. The staff are helpful and polite, and the buffet breakfast is great - lots of good-quality croissants, fruit, muesli, pan au chocolat etc. Location-wise, it's extremely convenient for Earl's Court, which is literally just round the corner, and there are two Underground stations nearby.There are only two real problems with the hotel: 1) some of the rooms can be on the small side - I shudder to think what Americans would make of them; and 2) the soundproofing is non-existent. Other than that, though, I'd thoroughly recommend it. Luxury at a reasonable price."
53,1321,"Feb 13 2008 	Great value and charm for London	I've stayed in lots of hotels in London over the years and this is certainly one of the nicest particulary as it is well priced for what you get. The hotel is charming, the staff are very friendly and helpful, the breakfast is excellent. The rooms are small, but in London it's difficult to find something large that's inexpensive. The hotel is well situated, close to the tube and there are several restaurants in Earl's Court Road. I will definitely stay here again and would recommend it highly."
54,1321,"Feb 11 2008 	Great Find	My colleague and myself chose to stay at 20 Nevern Square after another colleague had a successful stay there. It is so near Earls Court, literally round the corner and up the street. We got a good rate of 79 per room including breakfast which was a really good choice of cold meats, cheese, fresh croissants/pastries yoghurts and fruits. When we arrived to check in I noticed that one room we had been allocated had been crossed out and a different room number had been added 'Rm 2' - I asked straight away why this was but I the level of English spoken was not great. I asked a few times but I was just met with blank stares. I found my room whilst my colleague was show to hers No 25. They did offer to show me but I was happy to find it on my own, Rm 2 is down the stairs in the basement. Large bed, complete with apple on linen napkin, plate and knife, nice furnishings, patio doors onto a small terrace, a rather stained carpet and lots of hanging cobwebs around the ceiling/wall. The bathroom fan was on - I had read previous reports that they go on forever so waited a while. The phone rang and it was reception saying that the lady guest had left a bag in the room and they would collect it! (obviously someone had checked in and moved rooms!) I looked around but couldn't find a bag. Within a couple of mins the member of staff knocked on the door and I said I couldn't find a bag - I also mentioned that the bathroom fan was still on - he said I had to keep the door shut but I hadn't opened it. He said it would go off in five mins - as I had already been in the room for longer than this I knew it was not the case. Eventually the fan went off - I opened the door and on went the fan and lights so I timed it - 12 mins! This might not seem to bad in the day but at night if you just want to nip in the bathroom for something 12 mins is an age. You cannot avoid the fan going on as the light is activated when you open the door so you cannot use the age old trick of leaving the shaving light on over the mirror - although do do this as well as it saves you being plunged into darkness mid shower! Nice Gilchrist and Soames toiletries in largish bottles. I spent a sleepless night as I was under the lounge area which has a tiled floor as did the corridor outside my room and of course the lift going up and down disturbed me, it wasn't that loud just often and as I was in bed 11pm ish it was very noticeable. At 0630 the staff were up and down the stairs many times the sorting the breakfast out. This woke me up so I got up. My colleague had a room with a split level with the bathroom below and bedroom above - unfortunately I didn't get time to see it. Be warned - you cannot get a phone signal in Rm 2 - I guess this is why the previous guest asked to move rooms. Breakfast was calm and relaxed the waiting staff were neither friendly or not. Newspapers are available. On check out I mentioned that the fan stayed on for 12 mins - I am pretty sure it went in one ear and out of the other! I cannot mark this guest house down because of my experience it was just the usual grumbles of staying away from home y some one who worked in the hotel business for 20 odd years! It is very near to Earls Court Road so lots of restaurants. I would stay again but def not in Rm 2. Oh and they need a duster on a cane."
55,1321,"Jan 4 2008 	great small hotel	great small friendly hotel. very nice touches felt more like a b and b in the country, very homely feeling. in a nice quiet square two minutes walk from earls court tube station.a lot more soul than a chain hotel. very reasonable price for london. 105 for the standard double and 5 extra for the cooked breakfast, continental included in the room rate.about 7-8 stops to the west end theatres on the tube.will stay there again"
56,1321,"Dec 19 2007 	Really liked it but...	Twenty Nevern Square is a cute little hotel on a quiet, residential square. The hotel is very clean, the staff were all very helpful, and the buffet breakfast was just right. I booked a Luxury Double via the hotel's website (fast and easy communications!). I was given room number 6, whose door is on the 1st floor, but there are stairs up to the bedroom which is actually on the 2nd floor (cute!). The room is about 14' by 12' with a queen bed, two small night stands with more storage, a built-in closet, a small armoire with two more storage shelves that also contain a TV, DVD player and stereo system, and a small desk and chair. I had plenty of room to walk around the bed and store my suitcase. The bathroom is marbled, modern and clean.The Earl's Court Tube stop is about 5 minute walk away on Earl's Court Road. The road has plenty of little restaurants, a grocery store, and even a Starbucks. I felt perfectly safe walking around alone at night.While I loved the atmosphere of being in a townhouse it also meant that I had to deal with the thin walls and wooden floors (my upstairs neighbor loved to stomp around his room!). I would definitely recommend the Twenty Nevern but take caution if you're a light sleeper."
57,1321,"Dec 18 2007 	Not what I expected	Our booking was through Londonnights for 5 nights stay, I was so looking forward to staying in this Hotel but I must admit I was slightly disappointed. We had travelled for 30 hours from, as one Brit put it, the bottom end of the world - New Zealand - and were completely exhausted having had no sleep at all on the plane. The first thing that happened was none of the staff would come and help us get our luggage from the street up the entry stairs to reception they just stood there and watched us struggle. After checking in we were shown to our room and I just wanted to cry, the room was so TINY (it really is the size of a single room with a double / queensize bed squeezed in) we couldn't even get our luggage ( 2 suitcases &amp; 2 carry on's ) into the room. The irony was there was a folding luggage rack but nowhere to put it. I went straight back down stairs and asked for another room and after a bit of tooing and froing was told there was no other room that night but that they would move us in the morning &amp; true to their word they did. Unfortunately we did not sleep well that night because the room being on the 4th floor was so hot even with the window open. The next room we were given (room 11 on 2nd floor) was much better and even had a little table and chair to sit at and space to move. After this our stay was much better although one night after returning from the theatre I asked at reception if we could have 2 hot chocolate drinks sent to our room, only to be told sorry no that it was after 11pm and the kitchen was closed - so much for the 24 hour drink service I was told we would receive.Overall Twenty Nevern is a nice Hotel, clean and well maintained with a lovely buffet breakfast, and I would probably stay there again but I would stipulate that I wanted a room of a reasonable size next time. The staff were generally helpful especially the housekeeper, but not a lot of smiles forthcoming.Just one tip about the sensor lights in the bathrooms - if like me you are not tall enough to keep them activated while in the shower I suggest you turn on the makeup light over the mirror and then you won't be plunged into complete darkness while washing :)"
58,1321,"Dec 1 2007 	Important! contact the hotel directly!!!	I booked a twin room for 3 nights some three months in advance via a well known website. Having received a confirmation code in August, I e-mailed the hotel directly just two days before my trip. They had never heard of me nor had they received my reservation. The website insist that they definitely sent my request to 20 Nevern Sq Hotel in late August. I don't know who messed up but our trip was almost ruined by this oversight. Consequently, I have never set foot in the hotel, but I advise great caution with the booking. Check and double check before leaving home!"
59,1321,"Nov 30 2007 	A delighful hotel!	Stayed 4 nights whilst attending a conference at Earls Court Exhibition centre - which is only 2 minutes walk away. The hotel was excellent. I usually only stay in 5 star hotels but this was the best rating hotel I could find within walking distance to my conference, so was a bit hesitant at how it would be. Well it exceeded all of my expectations. The room (with 4 poster bed) was quite spacious by London standards with very high quality furnishings and fittings. Extra little touches like dimmer switches on lights in the bedroom and the bathroom, a nice range of quality toiletries, and an apple placed in the room each day were nice. The complimentary buffet breakfast was outstanding with a great selection of fresh fruit, cereals, cold meat &amp; cheeses, and warm pastries. Hot and cold non-alcoholic beverages are included 24/7 either in the public areas or delivered to your room. The presentation &amp; cleanliness throughout the hotel was immaculate, and the staff were all very well presented and helpful. Oh, and the free wifi broadband was an excellent service that saves alot of $$$ compared to the prices charged by other hotels. Overall an excellent hotel that I will stay at whenever I'm attanding a conference at Earl's Court. Highly recommended."
60,1321,"Nov 25 2007 	didn't get any sleep!	My wife and I booked the Ottoman suite for two nights in mid october for a romantic getaway from the kids. The hotel seemed very nice and the room itself was lovely, HOWEVER the Ottoman suite is a new room and unfortunatly when they fitted it out they didn't appear to worry about soundproofing the wall adjoining the private flat next door.We were kept awake from 12.30AM to 3AM by a child crying in the flat next door, the receptionist was polite and sympathetic but the hotel was full and there was nothing he could do (apart from give us tea in the lounge)Finally got to sleep at 3ish only to be awaken at 6AM by the very same small child, we then decided to check out a day early and write the trip off, the hotel would not give any form of refund on checkout and i finally (after several E-mails and several days) managed to get a 'goodwill gesture' of a refund for the night we didn't stay! (with no reference to the full price we paid for three hours sleep)In conclusion: Don't stay in the Ottoman if you want to sleep, and don't expect customer service if something goes wrong!"
61,1321,"Oct 29 2007	Lovely hotel.	We stayed at this hotel on the 19th October for one night, we were up graded to the pasha suite... fantastic. All staff were helpful, room clean, and a great find, will definately stay again. Ideal for a bit of site seeing a short walk from Earls Court tube etc."
62,1321,"Oct 21 2007 	Excellent Hotel	Me and my girlfriend stayed here Thursday 18th Oct for 1 night as we went to see a show. What a fantastic hotel this in. We were ugraded to a suite. (Long name beginning with S, room 3 in basement) It was ammaculate. Very clean. Hotel staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. Booked through londonnights.com at 99 for the room, and to get ugraded to a suite was fantastic. Highly recommend this hotel. Ideally situated as just 2 mins walk to the tube station around the corner."
63,1321,"Oct 15 2007 	Ideally situated.	We have just returned from a weekend in London with an overnight stay at number Twenty. Fantastic value for London, very helpful staff, good buffet breakfast and a relaxed ambience all round. We were upgraded to a suite with balcony overlooking the square, the bed was the comfiest we have slept in for years, and the room was beautifully furnished.It is such a convenient spot as it is easily walkable to Kensington High Street and Kings Road. Definitely going to pay a return visit."
64,1321,"Oct 8 2007 	Charming	A trade fair at Olympia, meant I needed to find a hotel for my Wife and I. Also, as this was the eve of our tenth anniversary, I wanted a decent one, without it being expensive. posh or stuck up. Having trawled through many internet pages, all the hotels in our required area seemed either not up to a reasonable standard or overpriced. I finally found Twenty Nevern Square, with it's excellent web site, fair and reasonable prices and helpful phone staff. On our arrival we were not disappointed. The area was very attractive with well kept period houses. The front was the hotel was very smart and tasteful. The lobby, reception and bar area were nicely decorated with a certain finesse. We had booked our car in. This was taken away by a member of staff to a secure parking area. whilst we checked into our room.I had booked what was called a Luxury Sleigh room. This was on the third floor. We used the lift, but I hate the claustrophobic feel of small slow lifts so opted for the stairs from then on. On entering, I was suprised at how small the room was. However, no one ever said luxury came in sizes, and where 'luxury' may perhaps be going a little far, the room was charming and well decorated with some very nice design features. A good size television and music system were behind a cupboard door should you require them.The on-suite was great and importantly very clean! The bathroom light and extraction fan came on automatically. Clever, but a little annoying in the middle of the night as they take what seemed about ten minutes to turn off again. This is after I've had to try and carefully climb over my wife without waking her as the bed is against the wall, being tight on space! The first night, the room was very warm. We are use to no heating and a large and airy room. The sash window would not open, and we wondered if this was for safety reasons, being high up. The next morning desperation for cool fresh air got the better of us and I soon realised it was just fresh paint that was keeping the window from opening. With a little persistence I soon managed to get the sash open. On going down to breakfast someone was mentioning to reception that their room was very warm, which was being well addressed by the staff.On returning that night the cleaner had left our window wide open! Better, it must be said, then a hotel which leaves its guests in cold rooms!The breakfast was excellent. Lots of different cereals, fruit croissants ... just about all you would want. You could get a 'English' cooked breakfast for more money, but why you would want to is beyond me. Complimentry teas and coffees are available any time from the bar.The owners and staff obviously take great pride in the hotel. All were cheerful friendly and helpful. I have written a couple of concerns, however, this is for the sake of giving a full appraisel. I couldn't honestly bring myself to give this hotel less than full marks.A very pleasurable experience. So much so we have already booked it again for next year!"
65,1321,"Sep 29 2007 	EVERYTHING WAS GOOD	This hotel is in a good location to trains (which we took to and from Gatwick Airport) and tube (which we used to travel in and about London). The Earl's Court area is a fantastic place to come back to at night. We often ate in the area and there are plently of places to choice. Our room was very small for a &quot;luxury double&quot;, which we booked directly with the hotel's website, but nice enough. I've posted pictures. The room was about 9 feet wide by 15 feet long, a double bed (which my husband and I found too small for two adults - and no upgrade was availble, we asked), a desk, a small table, a nightstand, a amoire that held the electronics - all in that space. The bathroom was all marble/tile and clean. While the bed was &quot;pretty&quot;, all the extra decor pillows had to be tossed off at night and our room was so small there was hardly a place to put them. The matching bedspread/comforter disappeared after the first housecleaning visit. After that we were left with only a sheet and light blanket. They sufficed since it was in the 60's while we were there. The carpet was dirty, but not bothersome. Bottled water and an apple were left daily by housekeeping. Check in/out was flawless, the front desk staff was courteous though sometimes not particularly helpful. For example when I asked for an upgrade they said to talk to the manager the next day. Seems ANY shift staff should be able to handle such a request. Our room was on the third floor (room 15) and had a very nice view and opening window. It overlooked Nevern Square Park itself and wasn't particularly noisy though it was street facing. The breakfast offered is gorgeous and the area in which you eat downstairs is nice and clean, courteous staff there too. Nice safe neighborhood day or night. I'd stayed here again but would definitely ask for a larger bed."
66,1321,Sep 23 2007 	Loved it...would definitely stay there again!!	It's small but very clean! Our room was basement level and our view was only the internal courtyard but it was tastefully done...oh and did i mention clean. The staff were very pleasant and the breakfast was excellent. The location was quiet but not out of the way. The nearest tube station was practically just round the corner. I would have no hesitation staying there again.
67,1321,"Sep 19 2007 	Convenient and good choice for London	Stayed at thius hotel for several days. It is located about two blocks from Earl Court metro in residential area with many other small hotels. Several restaurants a few blocks away. Breakfast was nice and the front desk helpful. Nice hotel. Our room in basement was barely bigger than our large bed. However, room was clean and nice, but window looked out on basement area. Not cheap, but in good London location and easy to get to from Heathrow on metro."
68,1321,"Sep 15 2007 	Good choice!	This is a pleasant hotel in a quiet residential neighborhood. It's a short stroll from either of the two Earls Court tube entrances, and it's not far from restaurants and entertainment options.We stayed in the Chinese room. By American standards (excluding NYC hotels), the room was small, but it was well appointed and comfortable. The view out the window onto Nevern Square was nice. Breakfast is available, so be sure to enjoy some OJ and Weetabix before you start your day. A computer with internet access is available in the lobby for a small charge. The front desk staff are very kind and helpful."
69,1321,"Aug 17 2007 	Loved this hotel	Stayed here for 8 days. Loved the location, loved the room, loved the breakfast. I usually can't stand to be without air conditioning, but the room we were in got plenty of cool air during the night, it was quite, and very nice. Yes the bathroom light is motion activated, but we never had a problem. Staff was exceptional. My daughter also stayed a floor up from us and had a balcony room. The room was small, but sitting on the balcony was a pleasure in the evenings and mornings. Plan to visit again next year."
70,1321,"Aug 14 2007 	average boutique hotel terrible staff and organizational methods	I stayed at Twenty Nevern Square while on a business trip a couple months ago. While there, I stayed in a room which was called a 'suite' but had no external windows. Nowhere on their site (or when I booked through them) did they mention anything about lack of sunlight fromt he outside world. There were heavy blankets draped over the curtain rods which would have been great if I had wanted to develop pictures at 3:00 in the afternoon. The door opened into a little courtyard where there was heavy foot traffic all throughout the day. They were also doing some sewer work when I was there and the area in which you accessed my room smelled of well, exactly what you'd expect a sewer to consist of. In the bathroom, the light is actually motion activated, so if your room gets at all steamy during your shower, your light will turn off and you'll have to open the shower door and wave your hand to get the light to go back on. The &quot;FREE wireless&quot; internet didnt work in the room and I had to either walk around with my laptop or sit in the lobby to check it. There are at least cool birds that enjoy watching you type away. However, with all the above issues, the proximity of this hotel to the office where I frequenty do business was is quite convenient. I travel to London about once a month from Chicago for work and its nice to be both close to the city as well as a short tube ride away from Heathrow. I contacted the hotel a couple months ago to book a couple rooms for a visit in September. I dedided that I'd give it another show and ask for a nicer room. I was offered one of their upgraded rooms (Ottoman Suite) and confirmed that I would accept it with the rate they provided me with. Although there was a bathtub in the middle of the room??? I decided why not.I heard nothing for several days and was contacted by the hotel a week later stating that someone reserved the room they had offered me with a &quot;credit card&quot; and therefore they would have to honor their reservation. They offered to give me a lesser rate on a smaller room and to give me complimentary english breakfast, which every guest receives for FREE! During this whole correspondence, I was emailed by 4 different people and none of them could seem to keep their stories straight. Basically what happened it someone looked to book their nicer room (the one I had reserved) for longer so they were looking to make a few extra bucks than to keep the loyalty of a repeat customer who had stayed there before and had given my word to stay there again. So again, the hotel is average at best, the english breakfast is okay if you like rubbery lunch meat and hard croissants. I've read in other reviews about being charged double on their credit cards and I can totally see this happening with their 1940s style of keeping track of reservations. They use a printed spreadsheet listing the different rooms by month!In the end, I would not recommend this hotel for the reasons stated above. I mean, the hotel has its &quot;charm&quot; but other London establishments have the same with a staff that treats you like they actually want you there, not just your money."
71,1321,"Aug 14 2007 	Unfinished room	checking into the hotel we were given a 'new room' which turned out to be unfinished in that not everything was stuck down, the room was extremely small with no fan and was just overall unsatisfactory. They gave us another room that was much more to the standard we requested and the breakfast was good."
72,1321,Aug 8 2007 	Wonderful Hotel	Beautiful hotel. Rooms imaculately clean and staff always happy to help. Decor throughout is beautiful. Will definitely stay again!
73,1321,"Aug 1 2007 	Value Plus	Stayed 2 nights at the beginning of June. Boooked via LondonNights (good rates for all of London). First night we had a very small but nicely furnished room in the basement, slightly stuffy and no outlook but bed was comfortable. Next day asked for a bigger room and that was promptly acted upon and that room was a really lovely one on the 2nd floor. Breakfast was fantastic, staff very helpful and friendly. Recommend to everybody as long as you don't have too much luggage (no place to keep it)."
74,1321,"Jul 27 2007 	What a find!	An excellent value. The staff at this small hotel was friendly and proactive. Newly renovated, this hotel features automatic lights, high-end fixtures in the (admittedly small) bathroom, and high-quality complimentary toiletries. The room was not huge, but beautifully decorated and had a TV, hair dryer, and a trouser press. The high-quality cold buffet breakfast--included--always had fresh tropical fruit along with several breads, cheeses, meats, yogurt, and cereal. We stayed for several days, intending to return a week later. When we did, we found our room had been upgraded to a suite at the lower cost because we were repeat guests. The hotel is a three-minute walk from the Earl's Court tube stop on the Picadilly Line for quick and direct access to central London; it is also on the District and Circle Lines for easy access to Notting Hill. I intend to stay again and already have recommended it to my colleagues."
75,1321,"Jul 27 2007 	Fantastic Hotel!!!	I found this hotel through Trip Advisor and after reading the (mainly) good reviews, I decided to book through LastMinute.comWe stayed for two nights (Weds &amp; Thu). The hotel itself was easy to find and about 5min walk from Earls Court tube station.We were shown to our room straight away and were given a 4 poster room on the first floor (room 7). The room was lovely, absolutely spotless and the furnishings were very luxurious. We weren't too bothered about the size of the room as we were planning on being out and about most of the time anyway. The room was a little warm at times, but there was a fan and an air conditioning unit.The next morning we were asked if we could be moved to another room, and were given a free upgrade to the Ottoman Suite also on the first floor, and we couldn't believe our luck when we saw the room, it was huge! Three massive windows, a cast iron bath in the middle of the room, plasma screen on the wall, high ceiling and wet room/shower, plus the biggest bed I've ever seen! It was truly stunning!We had continental breakfast in bed both days and the service and food was always spot on.We found a real gem and would definitely come back again!"
76,1321,"Jul 25 2007 	OK but probably could do better	Stayed for five nights in the Terrace room. The free breakfast was wonderful and very filling. The full English breakfast (at an extra cost) was also excellent. The location can't be beat; the hotel is on a quiet street but the Earls Court tube station is a few blocks away. The area felt safe even at midnight. The stores near the tube station were open late as well. All of the staff were also very nice and helpful. The private terrace was nice, but we didn't get to use it because it rained every day we were there. (We still had a great time in London!)The room was nicely furnished but extremely small (normal for London given the price) and stuffy. There's a fan in the room but it was too noisy. Leaving the window/terrace door open a bit didn't help much. The bathroom light and fan are on some type of automatic control. It goes on automatically but goes off at the most inconvenient times, like when you're in the shower or on the toilet for more than a minute or so (!). The loud fan stays on after you leave the bathroom for about 10 minutes, but I understand this is a UK building requirement. The shower/water control was very difficult to work.I would hesitate to stay here again. Next time I'm in London, I will probably try the Mayflower instead. If I'm going to stay in a small room like this, I'd rather pay less. The Mayflower is owned by the same people and the rates seemed a little lower. It's on a busier street but it seemed tolerable. A friend of mine stayed there when I was at 20 Nevern and I saw her room....it seemed fine and she had no complaints."
77,1321,"Jul 15 2007 	over-priced	not good value for money. the room was tiny and extremely warm with a window that had to wedged open with my book. The lights in the toilet were activated by sensors - which didn't detect you in the shower!!! On the plus side the beds were comfortable and the room was clean and tastefully decorated, although the furniture was too large. The breakfast was adequate but not exceptional.The area is great - plenty of bars and restaurants on earls court road and just a short walk from the tube station. The hotel did have a bar, not sure how it makes any money when its not open! Wouldn't stay here again in a hurry. I stayed in a hotel around the corner for half the price and got a room twice the size the last time I visited."
78,1321,"Jul 13 2007 	Nice Hotel Convenient Location	Just stayed at the hotel this weekend on business. I found it on [--]for 79 per night including breakfast (good choice of food). My only complaint was that my room was too hot - No 20 on the fourth floor. Technophobes might take a while to work out how to use the TV and the shower controls. Other than that, it was fine and conveniently located near many restaurants on Earls Court Road."
79,1321,"Jul 9 2007 	Great Quiet Location next to common and close to Earls Court Station	Twenty Nevern Square HotelOne nights stay (Saturday 2nd June 07) @ 109 for Rococo Room (given free upgrade to Ottoman Suite 250 +)Our flight from Sydney arrived at 7am and we arrived at the hotel a couple of hours later. Despite our request for the room to be made available ASAP because we would be jet lagged (this was requested when booked the room and also when arrived at the hotel), we were told that 2pm (i.e. the official check in time) was the earliest we could get into our room!20 Nevern Square is located just five minutes walk from the Earls Court station, which is on the boundary of the Undergrounds Zone 1 and 2. We dropped off our bags at the hotel and caught the District Line several stations north and got off at Kensington Park. We easily filled the intervening time by strolling through the park and gardens until we reached the boat hire at Hyde Park. Many Londoners were making the most of this green space on this warm spring weekend. We were originally booked in for the Rococo Room. However, we were told when arrived back at the hotel after 2pm that we had a free upgrade to the recently renovated Ottoman Suite, which is their newest and largest suite. This is located on the 1st floor (which hashigh ceilings compared to the other floors) and next to the Pasha suite. It appears the proprietors have acquired the adjoining apartment and created an access way to it. The Otterman Suite was not listed on the website, but in comparison to the picture of the Pasha Suite, this must be listed as somewhere between 250 and 300. The room is stunning when you first walk in. The chandelier and free standing claw bath are both eye catchers. The latter is standing outside the glass fronted bathroom and in front of the gas fire. The room is decorated in sumptuous crme and contrasted with a vibrant blue feature walls behind the bed and fireplace. There are four floor to ceiling windows which look out onto the Nevern common park and also provides access to the half balcony containing two small chairs and table. The suite has a very airy feel to it and I estimate it would be 3 queen bed lengths long and 3 bed widths wide. The ensuite however isnt on the same scale but the double glass doors means that it doesnt feel cramped even though it is small.The room has a 42 inch plasma TV, DVD player (but you must provide your own DVDs!), iPOD mini stereo including remote, and free wi-fi coverage. All of these except the DVD player were used and much appreciated. The hot water to the basin and bath was not working. I was told that this was sourced from the adjoining room, It couldnt be rectified that night, but we still enjoyed the claw bath by filling it with buckets of hot water from the shower, as this is heated by its own electrical element.The breakfast buffet is very nice and is served on the ground floor, where there are French doors that are open onto a small inner garden. A cooked breakfast is available at an additional charge and can even be served on the Ottermans balcony.Lastly, I can say from the 3 staff members that I dealt with that they are genuinely friendly and helpful. Even the person on receptionduty was still friendly when we inadvertently woke him at 4am in the morning to go out and get some kebabs! He provided us with directionsto the Kebab shop (shops are mostly clustered around the train station entrance on Ealing Rd). Im sure that even if we stayed at the Rococo room that we originally booked, despite it being smaller and less feature rich, we would have still enjoyed our stay at 20 Nevern Square."
80,1321,"Jun 28 2007 	Loved it!	Beautiful hotel. Was booked for a 4 poster bed room, but ended up getting the Pasha Suite!! (Thanks!) Room absolutely gorgeous, with a long balcony to sit and soak up the sun. Overlooks a lovely little square. Quiet location which is a bonus. Unfortunately it does not have a restaurant, but there are plenty to choose from within 5 minutes walk of the hotel.Will definitely stay again!"
81,1321,Jun 14 2007	Excellent Hotel - Value For The Money	Excellent hotel to stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Location is silent and easy to reach. The double rooms were a bit small sized whereas this is London. Expecting a larger one will not be fair.Whereas the Pasha Suite was just fine with the balcony.Fresh apples that you can collect everywhere in the hotel was a lovely detail.I advise the hotel.
82,1321,"Jun 11 2007 	perfect place to stay	I have just returned from having stayed two nights at this lovely little hotel. I was a single person booked in a standard double at 89 for each night. My two friends stayed in a superior double. My room was on the top floor (there is a lift), and had only a shower in the bathroom, which was fine for me. I don't think I would have liked it for two people though. My friends room was bigger and had a bath too. Both rooms were quite warm but a fan was supplied. They were both spotlessly clean with comfortable beds, TV etc. Tea and coffee was served whenever it was wanted, including in the room, and was free of charge.The size of the room would probably be an issue with Americans as I would think they are used to large rooms. It must be remembered that this is an old Victorian house, not a modern tower block, so judge accordingly.For anyone wanting a lovely, comfortable and clean place to stay, with excellent service and beautiful decor and close proximity to Earls Court tube, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. I certainly will visit again, sooner rather than later!"
83,1321,"Jun 8 2007 	Good Hotel	Booked this hotel for 2 nights through hotels.com (which was not a good thing to do) and on arrival found out we were not on the system and the hotel was full. The hotel were extremely helpful and put us up in their sister hotel 1 street away without further charge. They also moved all of our things back to the hotel during the next day and upgraded us to a 4 poster suite.Apart from the small mishap, the hotel was great, very comfy, and happy to help. Breakfast was great, more than enough in the continental breakfast. I would definitely stay here again as it was only 2 minutes from earls court tube and quiet as it is away from the main roads and tube lines.Next time I will check with the hotel before leaving home :&gt;"
84,1321,"May 20 2007 	Excellent hotel beware of a small room ...	We enjoyed three nights at Twenty Nevern Square and would definitely return again --- as long as we were sure not to book the room we had the first night, a verrrrrry small 5th floor walk-up that was balmy even with chilly temperatures outside. After the first night we were moved to a beautiful room with a patio, four poster bed and spacious interior, which really made our stay. The hotel is in a very quiet area of town, and is convenient for traveling to the airport. I would recommend this hotel for business travelers and couples for a romantic boutique hotel getaway. Tourists who are interested in being in the heart of the city may find the commute a bit tiring. Hotel staff is attentive and friendly, with complimentary coffees, waters and excellent directions/concierge assistance."
85,1321,"May 18 2007 	Great value good quality London hotel	Location=======The hotel is a few minutes from Earls Court Tube Station. The area is relatively quiet, with a large number of smallish hotels in the area. The main street, as you exit the tube station, has a variety of restaurants. A large number of which are fine, eg an italian, Nando's, Wagamama's, however, none I have found yet would be 'special'. There is a chemist, small supermarket and newsagents on the walk from the tube station to the hotel. The area can get busy if a large event is on at Earls Court itself, particularly the restaurants. The hotel is on a side street though and I've never found noise to be a problem.Rooms======I've stayed in 3 rooms, the junior suite, the terrace double and a luxury double which was possibly room 21 - it was on the 4th floor. All rooms have been clean and nicely furnished. Bottled water and fruit is provided as part of the room rate, along with tea and coffee which is freshly prepared and delivered to the room.The primary difference in rooms is the floor space. The junior suite was the largest of the 3 rooms, with a seating area, large tv, writing desk and floor space to spare. The bathroom has two sinks, a bath and shower. It is in the lower ground floor and looks onto a courtyard. The terrace double is a smaller room, with just enough space to walk round the bed, and a single sink and shower in the bathroom. However, this room has a large, private terrace with seating which we were able to make use of as the weather was nice during our stay. While the room size is adequate, other rooms would be preferable during the winter as the terrace would be of no use. My only gripe about this room was the lack of bedside table on one side of the bed due to space restrictions. The luxury double is essentially the terrace room without the terrace, although it does have a door that opens out onto a small area which is nice to let air into the room, although doesn't provide seating. However, it does have a shelf on either side of the bed! Food====Continental breakfast is included in rates quoted through the hotel. This is served in the dining area, which is a sun room at the back of the hotel. The dining area is quite small, with about 8 or 9 tables, but the hotel itself is small (about 25 rooms) and I haven't found that to be a problem. The continental breakfast is nice and provides a reasonable selection, consisting of a choice of 3 or 4 cereals, fresh fruit, cheese, ham, bread rolls, croisants, choc au pains, yogurt, juice and tea/coffee. Value for money=============All in all, twenty nevery square is excellent value for money in my experience, providing good quality, clean rooms and breakfast for in and around one hundred pounds a night - which is unusual in London."
86,1321,"May 18 2007 	Nice place good location	Stayed for one night midweek whilst in London working. Was a little concerned about the place having read some reviews, but was pleasantly surprised on arrival. Things got better when we were upgraded to a Suite! The hotel was clean and we were well looked after during our stay - this included free tea and coffee from room service on request and a good continental breakfast included in the price.The location was handy being so close to Earls Court tube, so overall I cannot really fault the place. Recommended, but having a free upgrade obviously helped!!Would probably stay again if the price was right."
87,1321,"Apr 1 2007 	Good all round choice in London	We stayed at Twenty Nevern Square for one night on a quick trip to London. All in all it was a positive experience. The hotel is located on a lovely quiet square only 3 minutes walk from Earl's Court underground. The staff were friendly and efficient and breakfast was a cut above the average. Our room was very small with just enough room to walk around the bed. It did, however, have the benefit of a large private terrace. On a beautiful sunny evening in Summer it would have been fantastic whereas on a rainy day in March I would have swapped for more floor space. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will use it again on my next London visit."
88,1321,"Mar 28 2007 	Charming hotel very friendly staff good location!	Last december, we went for our honeymoon to London en we booked this hotel because of the reviews we read here on tripadvisor. The reviews helped us to find a very nice hotel!!STAFF: Twenty Nevern Square is a pretty small hotel, so the staff remembers their guests, which gives you a very welcome feeling. They are very helpfull, they don't expect a tip for everything they do for you. If you want, you can get free (continental) breakfast in your room, which looks lovely and you can order whatever you like. You get free tea and coffee all day, which they bring again to your room.ROOM: We had a room on the ground floor, which only could be entered via the courtyard. In the winter it wasn't the most pleasant thing, but not really a problem. It mus't be nice in the summer I guess. The room wasn't very big, 3 by 5 meters, with a loose bathroom with a shower in the bath. INTERNET: There is free wireless internet, and there is a computer in the really nice furnished lobby.LOCATION: The hotel is pretty close (two minutes walk) from Earl's Court metro station, where 2 metrolines stop (Piccadilly line and District line). Several buses stop nearby (1 minute walk). For example a bus which brings you straight to Notting Hill. One minute walk (the other way out of the metro station) brings you to a shoppingstreet with several nice(!) cheap places to eat (Pizza Express, Wagamama, and so on).NEIGHBOURHOOD: The hotel is situated in a very quiet victorian street opposite to a small public garden.CONCLUSION: We are definitely going back to London and without any doubt we will stay in Twenty Nevern Square again!"
