17,593,"Jul 6 2009 	close to camden.	hi,i am just back from Hamstead Britannia and i think it was great value for money.The beds were really comfy and the staff were polite. Food wise if you are hungry after the restaurant is closed i would rec.ommend the sanwiches they are great. The hotel needs a little spent on the decor in the rooms as its a little dated. Very close to Camden and only 10 mins from Chalk tube station."
18,593,"Jul 5 2009 	Not perfect but ok for the price	Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of June.The hotel is an easy 10-15 minute stroll from Chalk Farm tube station in a pleasant residential area close to shops and pubs.Approaching the hotel it does look a little scruffy from the outside and I think it's fair to say it is in need of refurbishment (which is underway).Having said that there was nothing really wrong with our 5th floor room. It was quite spacious and the room, bedding and bathroom were all clean (although air conditioning or a fan would have been welcome as there was very little ventilation due to window opening restrictors and London was in the middle of a heatwave at the time so it was very difficult to keep cool enough to sleep!)Whilst I agree with a previous poster that the cold meats should have been kept under cover we thought the breakfast was fine. Plenty of choice and the food was hot and tasty and we never had a problem getting a hot tea or coffee from the flasks and the waiter removed our used plates promptly.Sure it's not The Ritz and there are areas of the hotel that need sprucing up and some of the public areas did look a little tired and worn but overall it served our purposes as we were only in the hotel a few hours overall and for what we paid (around 70 a night including breakfast) we thought it was fair value for money for a London hotel just 10 minutes by tube from the centre."
19,593,"Jun 30 2009	Dirty dingy and disgusting	Approaching the hotel, we thought it looked dirty but we were wrong, it wasn't dirty, it was filthy! We had to clean the bathroom before we could use it, the 'cleaner' had left her short black hairs everywhere and it stank of smoke and damp. I didn't mind that the furniture was old and needed replaced, I can cope with tired but not dirty. Breakfast was also vile, I heard one of the waiters tell another to go get some more bacon from the microwave! My daughter couldn't get her knife through the croissant it was so stale. The toast was set out on an old tray, still trying to work out how long it had been there. They seemed to use the cheapest of everything, poor quality sausages and bacon etc, even the serviettes would have taken a layer of skin off your face! Tea and coffee was served in flasks on the side of the serving table, again not sure how long they had been there, but the drinks were cold. There were no pats of butter, just a large bowl filled with cubes/slices of margarine floating in water that had been cut out of a tub! What worried me was that the cheese and hams were on a little side table, not chilled and this was during one of the hottest weekends this year, wasn't going to risk eating that! Eating there was certainly an experience and despite having paid for breakfast, we decided not to try it again after the first day, too risky!We stayed here on a theatre package as it stated that the theatre was 3 miles from the hotel. The taxi from the hotel to the theatre was 15, so obviously longer!!It was 2 bus or tube trips away from Camden Market which was a positive, as was the fact that you could leave your luggage there after you had checked out, although you were given such a look of disgust as if you had asked them to hide a dead body!All in all, dirty hotel, vile food, staff who didn't seem interested, would not go back, even if it was free!"
20,593,"Jun 26 2009 	Do not stay here at all.	Stayed here thankfully for one night, it is a grubby, tired old hotel, when you arrive it is very untidy outside, we parked our car at the rear of the hotel, clean laundry cages next to dirty greasy bins ans wastepipes, inside it smells stale and greasy, the windows are old and dirty, our room was grubby and shabby, dusty wardrobes, we left our clothes in our baggage , mildew around windows on the surrounding walls, curtains stained with damp stains, breakfast was passable but only just we only ate part of it and left the tea and coffee as the cups were greasy. This hotel should not be taking in guests it need closing down until it is cleaned and redecorated."
21,593,"Jun 16 2009 	HAPPY STAY: We would stay again - friendly staff and clean place	My partner and I stayed at this hotel during the time I received my MBE at Buckingham Palace (28 May 09). It, ideally, fitted in with a National Holidays week's visit to LOndon and so we booked for that week. It had to be right in order not to spoil this special occasion in my life.It was a great deal all round for us. The room and service we great. All the staff were helpful and friendly, especially a Polish waiter called Victor. Although they had builders at work, even they were respectful not to intrude, etc.We would and perhaps will stay again. The Primrose Hill area is beautful to walk around.Cheers Alec and Audrey"
22,593,"May 25 2009 	Great value hotel for a short break	Stayed in this holiday for a bank holiday break with my young son. Yes, this hotel could do with some refurbishment but it was great value, with a clean, tidy spacious bedroom and helpful staff. The breakfast was of a decent standard and the bar food was fine. Having read some of the reviews I had some reservations about what our stay would be like. However, for a cheap London break I couldn't fault the hotel."
23,593,May 17 2009 	Everything OK	We used this hotel as a base as we were going to a gig in Camden. I was a little concerned after reading some of the other reviews but every thing was ok . Considering what this hotel cost you could not complain . Plus free parking in London is a bonus ..
24,593,"Mar 30 2009 	Hotel was excellent but don't eat there.	Excellent stay at the hotel. Clean sheets and towels everday. Room was clean ,no mold, cobwebs or other nasties you can find in a hotel in London for under $100 a night. Chalk Farm Tube takes you to city center in about 10 min. Also very close to Camden Market. Also I will make a note on housekeeping very trustworthy. We left 400 GBP on the dresser in our rush to get out the door and it was still there when we got back that evening. American's will find hand towel and bath towels but no washcloths. Beds were not the best in comfort but if you walked ,which you will in London, you will be too tired to care. Lift/elevator worked. Restaraunt : I put this in a seperate paragraph because hopefully you don't base feelings of a review around a hotels restaraunt. The hotel restaraunt has 3 choices of menu. The bar menu, the buffet and then they have this other menu that know one seemed to know when it was good for? The bar menu is simple ,as it should be, but the food quality wasn't up to par for what they were charging. Hamburgers were better quality at a cabbie stop than here. That was my daughter's opinion and ,after tasting both, I agreed. The buffet was dreadful. We tried it once for breakfast. Watery scrambled eggs and luke warm. Bacon was dry and rubbery. The suasage was a mushy and flavourless. All for 21 GBP total for 2 people. Now this is my primary complaint. The morning that we ate breakfast they had run out of glasses for juice. The reason? The staff was fussing over the money in the till and who had paid, who hadn't paid and this was the norm for the restaraunt for our entire visit to the hotel. It took them ten minutes to realize they were out of juice glasses just from their disorganization. I don't really think they have from a customers view thought out how the flow should work. You enter the main lobby and then from there you walk into the bar area and from there is the main dining area. To get a drink form the bar you have to back around the front to the main desk to tell them you want to order. If you approach the main dining area the first thing you see is the till to the right. people we saw were confused as to where to sit in order to get service. Do you sit down first ? Do you pay first? Overall an excellent stay and if we go back to London we would definitely stay here again."
25,593,"Mar 24 2009 	Did the job!	We went to a concert at the Forum in Kentishtown and found this hotel to be in the ideal location to use as a base for the evening concert and then a shopping trip in central London the next dayThe reception was good and the hotel generally ok - just a bit dated in decor. One of our two rooms was a triple which had a makeshift bed that made us all fall about laughing when we saw it,except the lad who had to sleep in it - i'll say no more! The breakfast was o.k however we struggled to find a clean table to settle down on for our food. Compared to other London Hotels it was the price that attracted us and we got what we paid for. I would use it again as it was quiet and had a relaxed atmosphere but I wouldn't ask for another triple room!"
26,593,"Jan 5 2009 	Get what you pay for...fair enough	The decor is 1980's at best. It's jaded, faded or plain old falling apart, if it was your house you'd have had the decorators in years ago. BUT the staff are friendly and the hotel feels safe. It's 20minutes tube journey to Leicester Square and for the same price you'll not even get a hostel with shared bathroom this close to the centre of London.We were there for a Xmas treat and were dashing around doing the tourist things so in total we were in our room for about 8 hours. Value for money and conenience were great but if you want to impress someone or spend a lot of time loungnig in your room go elsewhere."
27,593,"Jan 3 2009 	Shabby hotel good neighborhood	This hotel was recommended to us by a friend who has a flat in the area. The neighborhood is residential, with shops and restaurants and even a laundrette, and the hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to the Chalk Farm Tube station. Unfortunately, the room we stayed in was disappointing. The furniture was quite shabby and dirty. The bed was somewhat comfortable but the blankets were of the kind where you don't want to touch them with bare skin since you don't know how clean they are. The bathroom was good, with great water pressure in the shower. The room was rather large. The TV remote didn't really work. The room was VERY cold and when we asked the hotel to turn up the heat they replied that it was a cold night and that was the best they could do. Rubbish! The food in the hotel was very bad, luckily there was a wonderful cafe nearby. We decided to move hotels after a couple checked in next door and we discovered that the walls were so thin, we could hear them unzipping their luggage! Overall, a hotel for young travelers on a budget but not a couple on honeymoon."
28,593,"Nov 10 2008 	Good Service	On reading some of the reviews about this hotel, my initial thought was to to agree about the standard of the rooms being slightly shabby but I liked the lobby and the hotel had an old sort of quaintness about it that I liked.I was woken up early - even though I didn't have to get up early on the Mon morning at 8am by a rattling set of step ladders but then I did see a sign up later that informed residents of work being carried out on that date.My main reason however for feeling that I should write, was to say that I left a very good coat in the wardrobe and upon inquiring to ask if it was still there, was told that it was!! The lady at reception then posted it back to me the next day and I was grateful to receive it.I just thought that it was good service as I definately didn't expect to see it again..."
29,593,"Oct 30 2008 	Not bad for the price !!!	Stayed here for four nights in Oct 2008,the booking was made via a travell company who provided transport from the North all for less than  200 p/p, this made the Hotel price about 40 / night which was very good.The Hotel itself is aged and in need of updating,the rooms were warm and apropiate for what we needed the water was hot and the room cleaned daily.The resteraunt was understaffed and sometimes we had to wait for a table to be prepared. The food was dull and boring but edible and as much as you could eat,the same applies for breakfast.The location is ok and Swiss Cottage station is 15 mins walk or you can walk to the main attractions in 90 mins .I wouldnt pay full price for this hotel unless i was stuck without a choice but as a package it was ok"
30,593,"Oct 3 2008 	Consider Alternatives Before Booking	OK get this hotel into context. It is in a good location with great access to Central London by tube or bus. It is not expensive, myself and my wife stayed for two nights (room 516) at a rate of either 89 (double room only) or 110 (double room and breakfast) per night and one great perk is the fact that parking is free for the duration of the stay.In terms of the quality of the hotel it is extremely poor. The rooms are very dated, the furniture is shabby, the beds should have been burned ten years ago and the whole place does smell with a combination of damp, decay, cooking fat and stale beer. We did try the breakfast one morning but gave up after the first mouthful, the scrambled egg were luke warm and had a texture as though they had been mixed on the floor of the car park prior to cooking, the hash browns - well lets just say it is a rare talent that can make hash browns with no potato. I literally spat out my first attempt at eating them.In terms of cleanliness - the bed linen was changed each day but due to the overall 'feel' of the hotel nothing ever seemed to be clean, the whole place just feels rank.The staff were very good, efficient, courteous and knowledgeable and you just have to feel sorry for them as I am sure they have to contend with a constant barrage of complaints throughout their working day so how they manage to maintain such a positive front is remarkable.So who is this hotel suited to? romantic weekend - no, family holiday - no, suffers of allergies - no, business executives - no, construction staff working away from home - yes. Don't want this to sound pretentious but in it's current state that is exactly the type of client that this hotel will suit, guys who are away from home during the week who are out to work early, do a hard days graft and then want to get back, have a shower, a few drinks in the bar and then bed - perfect.But the main advantage of this hotel is the free parking - if you are in Central London for a few days mid week it will cost at least 10 per day for the congestion charge, then say to park a car in a central London car park for a day another 40, so when you factor this into account, staying at the hotel and then getting the tube into London for day, you can reduce the room rate by a good 50 per day so really the best way of looking at this hotel isn't to say it is a hotel at all, but to look upon it as an upmarket car park!As the title to this review suggests consider other alternatives before booking into this hotel, otherwise I am sure the vast majority of people WILL be disappointed. Do not book the breakfast, there are two good cafe's within a two minute walk that offer great food, cheaper than the cost of the breakfast."
31,593,"Oct 1 2008 	Poor ValueShabby Rooms.	Hello,I hated this hotel,the price was simply a rip off.The hotel maybe well positioned,but the rooms are awful.There is no matress cover,the beds are uncomfortable.The rooms are falling apart.I complained on the day we arrived,but did not get anywhere.And wrote to the hotel on but no one had the decency to reply.They have your money and that's it.How can this place get 3 stars??I will never stay there again."
32,593,"Sep 29 2008 	Shabby but Central!	This hotel is in need of renovation however the staff were friendly,. the room large and clean and the Hotel is perfectly placed for shops and restaurants in North London. Would definately stay here again."
33,593,"Sep 12 2008 	Do not stay here..	This hotel is badly in need of renovation. Not only that but it is very unkempt. Wallpaper falling off, stains on the bed, smelly and very dirty room. You would not let your dog stay in this!I'm not sure how they have the nerve to charge the prices they do. I think I would rather sleep on a park bench!What more can i say..dont waste your money. There are far nicer and CLEANER places in London."
34,593,"Aug 11 2008 	Do Not Stay Here!!	Do not stay at this horrible hotel! We arrived there for a late check-in on a Saturday night to find a raucous nightclub going on in the hotel bar and the lobby filled with degenerate teenagers (we overheard one saying to another: &quot;Touch my iPhone and I'll slice you!&quot;) Not exactly a warm welcome. As we were at the front desk, we heard another guest complaining to the receptionist about the noise from the nightclub. The receptionist rudely told him there was nothing more they could do but have the music turned down, and that the party would end by 1:30am! (Sorry - isn't a hotel for sleeping?!) This was not a good sign. However, because we had pre-paid for the room, we went ahead and checked in anyway. Unfortunately our room was on the 1st floor directly above the nightclub/bar so the noise and base were ridiculously loud and the receptionist refused to move us, claiming all rooms were booked. To make matters worse, the room itself was fithly. There was dust and grime on every surface and the bathroom was repulsive. Not only did it look like it hadn't been cleaned, whomever had last been there didn't even bother to flush the toilet!! Truly disgusting.We tried to settle in eventually, and complained to the hotel night manager several times about the music, and he basically couldn't care less. Seems the management are there more to run a nightclub than they are for the comfort of their guests. After a sleepless night on a hard-as-rock mattress with springs sticking in our backs, you can bet I'll be telling everyone I know to avoid this dump like the plague!"
35,593,Aug 4 2008 	Tatty yes but value for money...	This is a hotel in serious need of a make over. The rooms are in a bad state and the reception / bar area are just so dull. However for 59 a night and with free parking only minutes from the underground or a short walk into London what can you say. If it's just for the night it is well worth it. Just stay out and use the room for sleep and washing and you're fine. If you are looking for some place decent and comfortable look elsewhere.
36,593,"Jul 21 2008 	needs updating	the daily laundry service was spot on. they changed the towels, made the bed, and replenished our drinks. the room was very basic, carpet had seen better days, furniture old, and uncomfortable. bathroom was just ok. the meals were ok, but there was no way i would have paid 10.50 for a cooked one, it wasnt worth that. on the second night we asked for sandwiches as we were going to the theatre, and wanted to eat before we left. she was so rude was the lady who brought them , your late she said, it was just ten minutes. i could not believe it, i could have understood if it had been a cooked meal. when we asked for them again the next night, it took them 30 minutes to do a couple of sandwiches, they came squashed in foil, which we hadnt asked for, and it was not even the right filling. and because of the lond wait, it made us late for the theatre. they charge 1.10 for 10 minutes use of the internet, thats a joke. it was i suppose somewhere cheap to crash down, but i will never go back there, i thought they were rude, and lack in customer relations experience."
37,593,"Jun 10 2008 	Avoid like the plague !	Having seen the Hotel Website and the pictures noted, we decided to stay over in the Hotel paying 115 for a standard double rather than less for a lower quality Hotel. We expected a failry basic but clean Hotel. Oh how we were wrong! This Hotel is a disgrace. The room was shabby and dated and smelt like an ash tray. The windows of the entire Hotel are covered in grime and the beds may as well not have a mattress on them for the comfort they actually give.The only positive thing about the Hotel is the fact that it is located in a nice part of London and is close to the Tube. However, we are surprised that the locals put up with such an eyesore.Never before have we been in a Hotel where we checked out early so we could go home to clean up!As noted in the header - avoid this Hotel like the plague!!"
38,593,"Jun 4 2008	decent hotel	Stayed at the Britannia Hampstead Hotel for 4 nights. I was pleasantly surprised after reading the reviews on tripadvisor. Yes, the beds were uncomfortable. But the room was clean and the hotel was a good value. The location was great, in a residential neighborhood, about a 10 minute walk from the tube. I would stay there again."
39,593,"Mar 18 2008 	Do not stop there!	We stayed at this hotel for one night, The price was very cheap hence I thought the quality of the hotel may be below average and yes it certainly was! The bedding was dirty, the bed base was dirty and the bed creaked liked crazy! The decor would have been fine in the early 1980's but sadly is now a litttle dated.Cannot comment about the food as we didnt eat at the hotel. If you are not phased by cleanliness then this hotel is fine but if you are then steer clear!!"
40,593,"Mar 15 2008 	Horrible stay	I stayed there for one night with a friend. We got the room cause it was cheap and close to the concert we were going to the next day. The second we walked in the door we noticed the old torn wallpaper. The bedspread had white stains on it. One can only assume what they were from. The window had cracks all along the frame. On top of it all, the toilet needed to be flushed 5-6 times just to get it to go down. The bathroom sink was cracked. The tile in the bathroom was dirty and also cracked. I only spoke to one person on the staff, and she didn't seem very willing to be helpful. I was just glad it was for only one night and because of the concert we didn't even stay in the room for more than just sleep."
41,593,Mar 12 2008 	Smoky smelly room	Just the most appalling experience - room stank of old fags - bad furniture - lumpy bed dreadful service - peeling paint work -sleep on a park bench but don't stay here!!!!!
42,593,"Feb 22 2008 	The Chintz	Work booked me in here for 4 nights. Looks ok from the front but the rooms are so old fashioned. Had an awful chandelier I kept banging my head off. The mattress was almost bare springs, didn't dare look under it....!Was in the previously mentioned room 321 overlooked by a tower block. 8am wake ups with the service lift too. Wierd banging noise coming from the bathroom, I think it was supposed to be the extractor fan but it was broken.Breakfast was utterly awful no juice or water, no fresh fruit. Staff are pleasant enough, efficient but not friendly. Wifi is useless, only available downstairs and very very slow. This place desperately needs doing out, considering it is in a nice part of London they must be losing so much money!Then who spends much time in a hotel when they are in London anyway! Do not book this as a romantic break, you will be gutted."
43,593,"Jan 4 2008 	Worst hotel room in 5 years	Very uncomfortable beds, the base of the beds were dirty, unfriendly staff, lights that hang so low in the rooms you bang your head on them, leaky bath, ill fitting carpet, plates and cutlery left on corridors all day, base of bed was stained, condenstaion on windows all day. Poor breakfast, the whole place felt like it was stuck in the 1970s. A word of warning - this hotel is a sister of the Scarborough Grand which is renound for it's outbreaks for food poisoning."
44,593,"Nov 25 2007	awful	the room was BIG but the mattress had 2 holes in it with broken &quot;sharp&quot; springs sticking out. We where cold and when we asked for a heater it did not appear. the rooms where tired and the bed linen had old stains, like the walls and carpet.By far the worst food i have ever had for the price. the chips was cooked in old fat, the meat was dry and you could bounce the potatoes up the street. Be ware! eat breakfast at 7 as by 10 you are getting the same food, they do not bring out hot food during the morning, we had to ask for it to be microwaved to heat it up. Check your bill as we booked on line and when we arrived they tried to double the bill."
45,593,"Sep 25 2007 	Not that bad!	My work sent me and a couple of my colleagues to stay here for a 5 days (10th to 14th September).Based on other reviews, I came armed with some air freshener and a brillo (the later fortunately wasn't needed!). Upon entering mine the room has a very strong smell of smoke, which the air freshener soon solved.The following day the room again smelt of smoke, and again rectified by the air freshener, yet the following days after, the room remained smoke free, suggesting the cleaner was smoking in the room!Apart from this, the double room was spacious, with a desk, coffee table, and chairs and a TV with Sky. The bed was comfortable with sheets changed every day, and the shower was neither too hot of too cold and bath wasn't too small.The lavish reception creates false expectations of room quality, as the furnishings and decoration was aged in all our rooms - The whole places feels like it could do with a lick a fresh paint!The block of flats opposite the hotel was a little overbearing, especially since the rooms lack any netting or blinds so you feel rather exposed.The reception staff were friendly although there was a small language barrier, and we had a few problems at breakfast with the staff telling us we werent booked for breakfast when this wasnt the case. I guess it were possible we were put in better maintained rooms as we were business customers but the hotel certainly wasnt as bad as other reviews describe! Although my stay at the Hampstead was OK, I wouldnt stay again."
46,593,"Aug 23 2007 	Desperately Needing Maintenance	We stayed in this hotel for 2 days to join American friends who stayed 9 nights. Our room had an overpowering pungent smell of mould the cause of which was all over the curtains, adjacent wall to the windows and the window pelmet. The photo's we took are daming evidence. our friends from the US never had their sheets changed in 9 nights! and their mattrass had huge stains, including a large blood stain! and a nasty 3 inch spring sticking out of the mattrasss. Photo's are also available of this. Requests to replace mattrass were not actioned. Wallpaper in the room had several edges stuck down with cellotape. Whilst we found the front desk staff very pleasant our meeting with management over our complaints were disappointing and met with disbelief and an offer of less than 10% off the bill !!."
47,593,Aug 20 2007	Worst hotel I have stayed in and I travel a lot	Curtains would not close leaving an 18&quot; gap. A man appeared at midnight to fix the problem he ended up ripping the darts out of each curtain to widen them but there was still 8&quot; gap at the side. Opposite was a block of highrise flats so that could see into our room at all times. We had to change in the small bathroom which was always wet through due to no ventilation. He said he would get the problem fixed the next day but he didn't. Beds have springs sticking up and were lumpy. Food was okay but just okay. I would rate this hotel as 2 star at most. It needs renovating. Wallpaper old.
48,593,"Jun 26 2007	Absolutely Deplorable Hotel. Do Not Stay unless you want a terrible time	I had the most appalling stay at this ghastly hotel. the room I was given (number 321) was directly opposite a service facility elevator, which is utilised by the housekeeping and cleaning personnel whilst servicing the rooms. Being given this particular room meant that at 8 am on Sunday morning I was abruptly awoken by the crashing and clanging of this service elevator, which of course must have been the time period that the room service personnel began to operate.Since this elevator produced such a loud excruciating, grinding and clunking sound with each and every extensive occasion that it was used, this meant that I was not only totally awoken in a terrible startled jolt, I also suffered awful sleep deprivation. However, the Hotel is little concerned, and further the Head Office in Altricham, Cheshire are not concerned with good customer relations, or spending money to make improvements, this is clear from the fact that the managing director (Mr Campbell) has not bothered to reply. DO NOT STAY!! AVOID AT ALL COST....D. WARDDUDLEYWEST MIDLANDS"
49,593,"Apr 19 2007 	Not recommended	I always meant to write a note to the General Manager when I left, but decided not too - as the condition of the hotel made me think that he/she would not take the critisism on-board anyway. It was in a badly kept condition, I agree with the previous review, it was just so dirty, the bed cover, the telephone, the light switch rim (all caked with dirt) and the remote control was in-ground with dirt around the buttons. The furnishings were old and tired. I called for a pizza in the evening from room service, and was told &quot; they would see if the chef was around or had already left&quot;. When it finally came, it was as expected, a disapointment (like a packet frozen pizza from Tesco's). The reception staff were coldly efficient, nothing more. Someone should spend some money on this hotel, it really needs it - and they should be checking after the Housekeeping department."
50,593,"Apr 11 2007 	Absolutely Dreadful	I've never written one of these reviews before but I really want to just warn people that they shouldn't stay here. I stayed at the hotel with my boyfriend two weeks ago, for a weekend, and the hotel completely spoilt our trip. We arrived to find we were placed in a smoking room (which absolutely stank of mould) when we had asked for non-smoking, at the end of a long coridoor lined with empty bar glasses and spilt piles of food. The room itself was tiny, not even a full sized double bed for the two of us, the side of which was covered in brown stains. The bed covering was dotted with burnt holes, and stank of cigarettes. The decor was absolutely revolting, and the bathroom was so dirty that my boyfriend wanted to buy bottled water to clean our teeth. I know it sounds like i'm exagerating, but the whole room felt so dirty that i slept in my clothes rather than use the blankets they provided. I'm a Londoner and i know that you could get so much better value for money somewhere else in London."
51,593,"Mar 14 2007	It did it's job..	I stayed here on a school trip. it was not ideal, but as I said, it did it's job. A touch of new wall paper and a clean up would do the hotel justice.Also, we were dissapointed to find that the lovely smelling hot breakfast was not available to our party. what a let down!!!If the windows opened, we wouldn't have boiled to dealth, as it was the middle of summer, and i would have prefered it if the rooms hadn't smelt of smoke. (and we even found a half-smoked cigarette in the bathroom!!!)All the same, we survived and I lived to tell the tail."
52,593,"Feb 6 2007 	The worst service I've ever experienced	We stayed at this hotel on New Year's Eve - and it was the worst hotel experience we've ever had. The room was unbearably hot all night, despite hotel staff insisting the heating had been switched off. Even with the window wide open, the room was too hot to sleep in. 'We asked for some water to be brought up to us to help us cool down - and at first, we were told that no one could bring us some. After another request, we were made to pay 3 in the middle of the night. When we complained, the duty manager was extremely rude to us, told us there was nothing she could do about &quot;such a small problem&quot; and walked out. The desk manager was so embarrased at her behaviour that he apologised for her behaviour. We have since complained to the Britannia head office, who say their staff acted &quot;appropriately&quot;. We paid 115 for a hotel that doesn't even appear to qualify as a three star hotel and has staff that think its ok to be rude to customers. We shall NEVER be staying at a Britannia hotel again."
53,593,"Jan 14 2007 	Not 4 star	Booked the Britannia International with Alpharooms.com 3 months in advance and paid up front. Received our voucher by e-mail and had no more correspondence. We arrived on the due date on the due time, only to be told that there was no room at the Inn!Apparently, at the time of the booking (in September) their system was down and a double booking occurred! 3 months in advance remember and no further correspondence. They sent us to their other hotel, &quot;of the same standard (4*)&quot;, but no pool, &quot;but they would make it nice for us&quot;. This hotel was the Britannia Hampstead. It was NOT 4*, I would have been pushed to give it 3*. We received a bottle of wine to &quot;make it nice&quot;, which was not very nice at all!The room was a smoking room - not requested by us! The smell in the corridor was bad, but even worse in the room! There was stains on the carpet, and on the wardrobe door, the lamp was not working, there was old, old furniture, frayed bedspread - no duvet, campbed for the child that sagged in the middle, no view of the Thames as we booked! The view was condensation on the windows, complete with mildew.We were not the only people to be moved, speaking to other people at breakfast, showed that they too had been moved after arriving at 9.00am and told that their room was not ready and to go shopping for the day, it would be ready when they got back! They arrived back in the evening to discover that there was no room, that they had doubled booked!!!When we arrived at the International, it was very, very busy with people wearing badges, there was clearly a conference taking place a the hotel, and we believe that they took our bookings. The International clearly thought that it was okay to lose our bookings for the conference - probably for a lot more money!We will never book with Britannia again or Alpharooms.We thought that we would take it up with Alpharooms when we got home as we booked with them and paid them in advance. However, they don't accept responsibility. You have to take it up with the hotel at the time!Totally spoilt our weekend."
54,593,"Jan 9 2007 	good hotel given a bad name	I totally agree with the last review of this hotel, I have just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel with my boyfriend and we wish we had made it 3 nights.I too booked the visiting family and friends offer @29 a night, staff on arrival were pleasant and checked us in in minutes, having read previous reviews of this hotel I was dubious about the rooms but having read reviews for other hotels before and then gone and stayed in them I have found that some people want hilton hotels for travelodge money. anyway the room was fab,we even had a chandelier. good wardrobe and drawer space and even tho we had a room facing the street which is a main road, traffic noise was no problem. Didn't eat or drink there as we went to london to do camden and hampstead restuarant and pubs but menu and bar prices seemed average for that area. Walking back to hotel late at night (about 3.30am) felt very safe it's all main road.would def recommend it if you are getting a deal price"
55,593,"Jan 7 2007 	what on earth is all the fuss about?... jeeeezzzz	booked this hotel for 3 nights from 21st December through to Christmas Eve..... were visiting family so we booked through the hotel website on their 'visit friends and family scheme' (or something to that effect)....the hotel is in primrose hill (excellent location), about a ten minute walk from chalk farm underground station.... or a minute on the number 31 bus across the road from the station.... (this bus couldn't be more frequent... runs every couple of minutes as far as we could tell)......ok.. the hotel... hotel staff were pleasant, courteous, knew their job... the room was large, we were not falling over each other.... ok the furniture was not claridges but then we were not paying claridges money either... housekeeping was good, towels changed each day, room cleaned perfectly..... if we had any criticism it was that the shower was not very powerful.... however... there was a bath so not a huge problem.....the best part.. the bill.... 89 for three nights!!!!!... now tell me... where can you get three nights in a perfectly adequate hotel for that money in the centre of london.... you can't ... believe me.. we know.. we have tried them all.......and some that supposedly had very good reputations did not come up to the standard of this hotel......i have only one this to say to counter the criticism laid upon this hotel...... get a life!!!"
56,593,"Dec 28 2006	Fantastic location rooms OK	I have just returned from a Christmas Package booked through Shearings. After reading other reviews I was prepared for the worst and even took my own air freshener! However the room was OK. The wallpaper is dated but the facilities were fine. In fact we had 15 drawers. The bathroom was fine, there were tea and coffee making facilities and a trouser press. The only downside was that the windows were covered in condensation every morning.What makes this hotel stand out for me is the location. You can walk to the top of Primrose Hill in 5 minutes and see the whole of London displayed in front of you. Then you can carry on to the canal and walk by Regents Park Zoo to Camden Lock. The markets there are fabulous and the place is buzzing.The hotel did not really seem geared up for the three coachloads of people so the meals were a bit hit and miss. The staff were helpful but overworked and not properly oganised and sometimes the food ran out.The evening entertainment was very good indeed.I would certainly consider returning and using the hotel as a base to visit London."
57,593,"Dec 17 2006 	Absolutely horrific horrible place never again	Really this place is quite horrible.If you are on a budget, I strongly advise avoiding this place and sticking with Ibis, travelodge type places.I've stayed there three or four times, as my company has an account with Britannia hotels. Each time has been horrific. The rooms are not just shabby and outdated, but dirty and smelly. I'm a smoker, but I was knocked back by the stale stench greeting me in one of the rooms. Each bathroom I have been in has been really quite disgusting, with bad housekeeping: hairs in the bath, poo in the loo and so on.The beds are uncomfortable and the breakfast very poor.Avoid at all costs."
58,593,"Oct 31 2006 	Not all that bad!	My friend booked our overnight stay here on laterooms.com. It was a really good rate but I was really concerned reading the reviews on here. So I was expecting the worst!! However, it just wasn't that bad. The location is fantastic, right in the trendy Primrose Hill/Belsize Park area. Our room was fine, just like a guest house bedroom with individual style (albeit very dated!). It was warm and spacious and the bathroom was fine. It wasn't the cleanest if could have been but it didn't fell grimy. We had a side facing room so even though we had our window open, there was no traffic noise.The staff were very accommodating throughout. We came back in from our evening out to have beers and sandwiches in the hotel bar at 11.30pm.I wouldn't choose to stay here for a longer stay, but it was absolutely fine for our purposes."
59,593,"Oct 3 2006 	a god awful hellhole	This hotel claims to have smoking and non smoking rooms, but as there is no ventilation system to speak of, and no air conditioning, the smoke from the rooms below and above us was so heavy, I had an asthma attack. Literally! The windows don't even open more than a crack for some reason, so the smell of the place is pretty gross. The decoration can best be described as an eyesore, and with few exceptions the staff is overworked and surly. Basically, imagine a really old English pub, put a bed in it, and you have this hotel. There is really nothing good I have to say about this place at all."
60,593,"Aug 28 2006 	excellent service but the hotel needs Refurbishment	Spend two days on a family holiday, for the price I think it was definitely a good deal. The hotel itself is about 3-4 miles for the main attractions so you need a transport. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel. The service and the food were very good, Both Breakfast and dinner were an open buffet with a good variety of choices. staff members were very friendly, and you can see that they are trying their best, rooms were clean, clean linen and every thing is in working order. Our room had a great view of London. However the hotel itself is left to run down, the decorations are aging, the furniture and the painting needs immediate attention."
61,593,"Feb 17 2006 	Fawlty Towers	This hotel is by far the worst hotel i have stayed in it makes Fawlty towers look like the Hilton ,it is that bad. On entering my room i was knocked back by the smell of damp lucky my work collegue was in the room next as i ended up sharing with him when i explained to the girl on the reception desk about the room she said it was a smoking room??. I explained that it was not smoke i could smell and that i did not require the room she then said there would be no refund as i had already checked in!! My friends room was not much better with ripped curtains and a disgusting bathroom. I am not overly fussy about hotels but the best about this one is the door out!!!!"
62,593,"Feb 13 2006	Do not stay in this hotel	We checked in, saw the room, and immediately checked out again. There is no way that this is a 3 star hotel, even by London standards. The furniture looks as if it has been salvaged from the dump, the bathroom was unsanitary and I felt more dirty having been in the room than travelling on the underground. In fact, the toilet hadn't been flushed properly from the last occupant of the room which sums up the experience. We were shown a better room which was marginally more comfortable but there is no way I would stay there. It's out on a limb where transport is concerned (Chalk Farm tube station as opposed to Swiss Cottage as advertised on their website) and there didn't seem to be any restaurants or cafes within sight. ON NO ACCOUNT CONSIDER THIS HOTEL IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY YOUR STAY IN LONDON. We transferred to the Thistle Kensington Park which was a much nicer hotel in a great area."
63,593,"Feb 10 2006	worst hotel EVER !!!!	this has to be the worst hotel that i have ever stayed in the rooms were damp very smelly and old fashioned i had to clean the bathroom sink and toilet before we used it my work colleague had to move rooms due to the damp and dirt in his room. the breakfast was inedible the eggs were powdered and were more like soup the sausages were off and the bacon was so hard we couldnt cut it up the staff were the rudest and most unhelpful i have ever met we stayed on a business trip and my colleagues and i moved too another hotel and we could eat, shower and sleep in claen rooms this hotel should be shut down"
64,593,"Feb 10 2006	definitly not 3 star	I read your previous reviews but still went for 3 days. we booked 2 twin rooms and a double. One of my friends room had a window which would not close and someone had stuck a pillow into it. The window and frame were covered in mildew. My other friends were in the double room and it had a damp smell within the room. My room was adequate but not what I would expect of a 3 star hotel, the curtains were old, shabby and TORN. All the bathrooms were poor and although possibly clean, they looked dirty especially around the wash hand basin. Sealant had been put directly over mildew. My friend could not stay in his room and moved in with me (unfortunately we could not move that night) but all three of us moved to another hotel after another day.I have stayed in London quite a few times and found this one to be old and in need of modernisation. There were cob webs on the stairwell passages and in our bedroom. The public toilet close to the check in desk smelt of urine, we did not find the staff helpfull and the hotel did not have any information on local attractions of london theatre guides so we used another local hotels facilities and then moved there.I know someone reading this will think I am very fussy, but is it too much to ask for curtains, no cobwebs, friendly staff and some information on London attractions. No doubt my other friends will add some comments and even a photo."
65,593,"Jan 25 2006	not too bad	It's old and a bit tatty, but for the money it isnt bad. It also does give you access to Primrose Hill, 15 minutes walk. There are some cool pubs and gastro-pubs and nice little shops and restaurants very near by. Breakfast there, better value than 10 at the hotel."
66,593,"Jan 25 2006	excellent vallue for money	Having read previous reviews of this hotel rather nervous about booking. However, wanted a hotel within walking distance of Hampstead Theatre and was very pleasantly surprised by this one. Large double room with good sized en suite. Room clean, tidy and warm. TV with satellite channels. Tea and coffee making facilities. Staff friendly and efficient - (light bulb had gone in bedside lamp - changed within minutes of phone call). Check in and out easy. Price unbeatable at 45 for 2 people (breakfast extra)Will definitely return."
67,593,"Dec 28 2005 	Dirty Poor Service	Filthy bathroom, had to clean toilet before I could use it, layer of dust on shelves and old hairdrier, encrusted dirt in corners.Duvet had brown stains on it. When I asked for it to be replaced it was just taken away. Service on reception abrupt. I paid extra for an 'executive' room. I suspect 'full' prices quoted on a well known late room booking site are rarely charged. Receptionist wouldn't tell me usual price for my room.Breakfast restaurant dirty - tables were not cleaned between diners, some resorted to clearing tables themselves, cutlery dirty, food quality poor, and items were not replenished as they ran out without asking and waiting.Stay away."

1,595,Oct 22 2009 	Perfect Location	A perfect location for The Royal Brompton Hospital. Perfect for a one nights stay. Hotel room very clean and adequate for our needs and it was nice to have breakfast in the room. Would recommend as value for money and closeness to tube.
2,595,Aug 30 2009 	Clean and good location	i stayed in brompton hotel with my partner. the room was nice and clean. we even have fridge in our room. staff were polite and very nice. we love the hotel and its location . perfect for london. cheap and nice place to stay.
3,595,"Aug 29 2009	A miserable experience	The ONLY thing this place has going for it is the close proximity to South Kensington Tube. I don't know where the rooms on their website were - we certainly didn't get one!We arrived late at night from Paris and were given a room that backed onto concrete walls with escape ladders against them . The temperature in the room must have been almost 50C so we had to sleep with the freestanding floor fan on full blast in order to get some relief BUT the noise of the fan kept us awake. Cluttered room space, cheap laminate furniture and nylon bedspread complete the picture.The bathroom was the smallest I have ever encountered; the door wouldn't stay open and when we were showering one elbow banged against one wall and the other elbow bashed against the shower door. It was so cramped. Plus, the shower temperature was stuck on very hot so we could not stand under it without being scalded. This was at 11 p.m. with our suitcases already opened and another 'plane to catch the next morning. What a disaster.We almost cried when we walked into this place, and if it hadn't been so late at night we would have left immediately.I think this place would suit younger people, a step up from backpacking perhaps, or those with very low expectations?"
4,595,"Aug 13 2009 	wont stay anymore	i was terrified when i arrived the hotel as there's no lift! i need to drag my huge luggage up 4 levels to my room. nobody will help u in the luggage. basically, no service here. if u r staying w/ elderly, u MUST avoid it since it is definitely not suitable. the location is great and easily accessible to the tube and harrods."
5,595,"Jul 21 2009 	Avoid at all costs!	We had an &quot;Executive Room&quot; which is the best they provide and it was up about 4 flights of increasingly narrow stairways with no lift. One of the single beds was broken, both beds had filthy linens with visible hairs on the coverlets and on the sheets. The futon (!!) that was an extra sleeping surface had a cover on it that looked as though it had never been laundered. The bath had been updated but the rest of the room was embarrassingly shabby and poorly maintained. The high-speed internet they said was available was from a wireless router 4 floors below behind the reception counter and was barely 1 bar in our room - we had to use a public signal from a nearby business that was hit and miss. Simply terrible - this hotel takes advantage of tourists due to its good location to the tube and central London location and makes no apologies about it. We chose to pay a 1 night penalty and move out to Heathrow and just ride the tube in each day - turned out to be cheaper all the way around and we stayed at a reputable and CLEAN modern hotel just further out. Horrible experience - we laugh about it now, but were in tears at the time. Please feel free to contact me, we have pictures to share, just had trouble uploading. Don't fall for their slick website - do your research and you'll be much happier."
6,595,"Feb 2 2009 	Do not stay here!!	We stayed at the Brompton for one week, we had to pay up front because we were given a special rate, this was not worth it! The room was dirty, the walls looked like they had never been cleaned there were coffee and other stains all over the table cloths and the bed spread smelt weird. On day 3 the internet went down and the staff refused to help, even though we told them before our stay that it was crucial we had the internet to do business. On day 4 we had our clothes washed, one of our sweaters came back badly ripped when we complained they blamed us for damaging the sweater and refused to help. The staff were rude and unhelpful when it came to handling any sort of situations that may have arisen. When we complained about this we were told we couldn't expect much for the rate we were given!! Not even electricity and a functioning shower tap!!"
7,595,Dec 26 2008 	Nice Clean Hotel what else you expect Good value for money	I have recently been to this hotel.Superb Location just 2 mins walk from South Kensignton Tube station. I was looking around to stay on my last day in london and came across this hotel. its very clean as compared to other hotels i stayed in london before. Rooms are clean and good customer service along with breakfast served to room which i liked most. Breakfast is continental but its inclusive that good thing. most hotels around south kensignton are very expensive as compared to brompton hotel. so i can say its good value for money
8,595,"Nov 25 2008 	Meh	Now, truth be told - this is a really average hotel, with dusty rooms, and a REALLY cramped bathroom. BUT compared to other London Hotels in this price range? It's pretty good. Great location - would I go again? mmmm, nah - increase your budget and stay somewhere nicer!"
9,595,"Nov 9 2008	Great location but minimal service	I stayed here for an extra night in London at the end of a business trip, on the advice of an Eyewitness guide. The location is great- around the corner from the South Kensington tube. But the hotel was not much better than a hostel. The bathroom was tiny and the door would not stay open. The toilet barely worked; the shower was in need of repair. There is nowhere to have breakfast- they bring it to your room. And the staff is very rude- asking for directions prompted rolled eyes and snarky comments."
10,595,Oct 13 2008 	Don't believe the Website	This hotel is nothing like that advertised on their website. The rooms were very small and looked out over piles of rubbish and needed a good clean. The bed was like sleeping on the floor and the bathroom so small you had to squeeze round the door to get in past the toilet! Would we stay there again - only if the rest of London falls into the Thames!
11,595,"Aug 21 2008 	Terrible value for money - very dissapointing	Got stranded in London and decided to stay here at short notice. Judging by the pictures shown on their website it looked great. In reality it was awful, depressing, small and the matress was so cheap it was like sleeping on the floor. The shower didn't work properly and the shower controls fell off in my hand. We also switched rooms once because of the high noise volumes. We had to ask for extra towels because both rooms allocated to us had only one towel available for guests per room.The continental breakfast was a joke, consisting of a boiled egg &amp; two slices of toast each with tea or coffee.AVOID the bar located on the ground floor of this hotel (Janet's Bar) We paid over 10 for one small bottle of beer and a small glass of undrinkable cheap wine.Places like this really make me sick, they prey on tourists who maybe unfamiliar with the area and over charge ridiculously.Trust me, I work in the South Kensington area and I'm positive you can find a lot better without even trying."
12,595,"May 14 2008 	Had to switch hotels	Wow, this was a disappointment. The only thing going for the Brompton is its fabulous South Ken location, minutes from the tube. Everything else was horrible. We had an &quot;executive&quot; room--it was up on the 5th floor (no lift) and the a/c didn't work, so it was uncomfortably hot the whole time. The headboards were ripped and stained, the beds themselves narrow, saggy, and uncomfortable, with pillows the thickness of pancakes. The couch was also ripped and stained, and the carpet was too creepy to walk on barefoot. On one of our two mornings there, there was no water in the bathroom. For over 2 hours. And although we were paying for internet, it was a very weak signal and kept coming in and out. We finally couldn't handle it anymore and had to switch hotels; we gave them 24 hours notice but they refused to refund us, saying they needed &quot;72 hours notice.&quot; 72 hours? Are you kidding me?If this hotel were $40/night, I could understand. But at six times that, I was expecting comfort and cleanliness. This hotel has neither."
13,595,"Nov 7 2007 	Excellent Value	Our holiday was snatched from the jaws of disaster when we discovered, completely by accident, the Brompton Hotel. We had gone to great pains to book a hotel in advance that seemed perfect, but it was far from it (separate review). We found the Brompton around the corner and it was a pleasant surprise. We switched hotels immediately.The staff are very friendly and helpful. The airy room had a nice bathroom, a refrigerator, free Wifi internet access, tea &amp; coffee. Fantastic location. Not the fanciest hotel, but very comfortable and an excellent value."
14,595,"Oct 19 2007 	Decent Value Great Location	Quaint hotel in a fantastic location, prices were very reasonable for a London hotel. Didn't have any water one night out of three, but room was very spacious and clean. No lift/elevator, so if you're staying on the top floors you will need to drag your bags up. Great location only seconds from the tube and not much noise from the city streets. I would recommend this place to travelers who want to see London and not stay in the room all day."
15,595,"Oct 2 2007 	Good value for the money	We were booked for only one night but the room was clean, looked like all the furnishings were relaitively new and the bathroom had just been remodeled. The room also had a small closet with a refrigerator, etc. The location is excellent...very easy walking distance to Harrod's, Hyde park, musuems. Tube station is less than a block. Everyone we encountered was very pleasant and went out of their way to be helpful. We would most definitely stay there again."
16,595,"Oct 1 2007 	Appearances are definitely deceptive!!!	This hotel is NOTHING like their web site, they should be targeted by the Trading Standards Office!!! IT IS VERY, VERY SHABBY !!!!On the site, it gives the impression of being a good standard of accommodation, when in actuality the room we were in fell well below our expected standards. Our room, a supposed 'Deluxe Triple' was dreadful! It reminded you of poor 'student' accommodation. The furniture was old shabby and very dated, the carpet was dirty, the fridge in the room was full size and old, it was noisy and very close to the bed.Wallpaper was hanging off, paintwork was filthy. Most worrying and very unsafe, were plug sockets hanging off the walls. There did not appear to be an obvious alternate fire escape route, except the main entrance and no fire regulation information was displayed in the room. Probably the most annoying thing of all at this hotel was the noise in the early hours of the morning. It sounded like 'freshers week', people chasing each other and shouting.Do not be fooled by the lure of its location, although it omits to mention that it is sandwiched between shops, bars and right on the junction of major traffic lights. Yes it's very near the tube station, but so to are many other high standard hotels which on inspection actually deliver what their web sites say!!!!Thankfully one nights stay in The Brompton was most definitely enough. On a positive note, our sight-seeing trip was fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed that part of it."
17,595,"Sep 25 2007	Familiar Environment	This is a small hotel with a very good relation between quality and price. It's like a tipical English house with a familiar environment, it's really well located, and the best is that breakfast is served at room!!!! If I have the possibility of going back to London, I will go back to Brompton Hotel."
18,595,"Sep 11 2007	Small Room	We stayed at the Brompton, and were very surprised that the room was so small, mad eworse by the overstuffing of unecessary furniture. Breakfast was provided, but was stone cold by the time we got it each morning. But on the plus side, just down the road from the South Kensington tube station."
19,595,Apr 23 2007 	Worse Hotel in London 	One of the worst hotels ive ever stayed in!!! Room was nothing like the pic!said double bed and they gave me two singles and said push it together and theres your double quite literally! dark room like a cellar! horrible bathroom!just imagine a bunker and it was worse than that!!!NEVER STAY
20,595,"Mar 12 2007 	Horrible place!!!!	FILTHY! I booked through their website for 3 nights. The pictures on the internet were quite nice so I trusted that the place was ok and confortable. DO NOT TRUST them!!!!The manager is unfriendly and not helpful at all. The rooms too small, horrible furniture, the bathroom old and unconfortable. Extremely small. Dirty carpets. Dirty and very old bed linen, not big enough to cover the whole mattress.No breakfast room... they bring a very tiny and unsatisfyingly breakfast to your room. Do not go there!Brunella Bordoni and Lanfranco Barbieri"
21,595,"Dec 11 2006 	not good	Only stayed one night but I think that was enough!! The memebr of staff when booking in was very rude. He couldn't even be bothered to tell us where our room was, and considering it was down a few corridors and up loads of stairs we ended up getting lost...it also didn't help that the rooms on that level didn't have any numbers on them, so we ended up trying to open many doors!!We didn't come across any bed bugs but the tiles on the floor of the bathroom were broken (dangerous), and the shower wasn't working. The water coming out was scolding hot so to turn it off I had to cover my arm with a towel.I have stayed in some pretty bad hotels in my time but this I just found sad. It could be a wonderful hotel; perfect location and a quite a nice building. Be prepared to pay for your room in advance!!!"
22,595,"Nov 25 2006 	Excellent stay no problems	My parter and I had read many previous reviews of this hotel and were some what hesitant, however having now stayed at the hotel and firmly say our stay was excellent and we and other guests staying at the time whoem we spoke to also seemed very satisfied.The hotels location is faboulous and so central to everying, and the size and decor of the room we stayed in was far better than other larger hotels we have stayed in in the past. Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel..."
23,595,"Sep 27 2006	Don't stay! Disgusting! Filthy! Bugs! 	I only booked because this was described as a Three Star Hotel. It is not! - NO lift (and some of the rooms are four storeys up). - NO public reception rooms. - 'Sod-you' attitude from the ever-changing staff behind 'Reception' (a tiny cubicle on a landing). - A 'breakfast' that would not look out of place in a Jail - a plastic tray shoved outside your door - cheap bread for 'toast', little plastic-packed pat of butter, same for jam, Lidl orange juice, a boiled egg. That's it! No choice at all.And most of all...DIRTY rooms, DISGUSTING bathrooms, and BUGS!I stopped four nights, and had to change rooms three times. First room was so indescribably filthy I refused to sleep in the bed at all - ripped the cotton sheet out, placed it on top, and slept under my own shawl. The decor: stained, grubby, gritty carpet full of spill marks and fag burns; floral wallpaper from the eighties with stains and marks all over it; bedhead and wall lamps thick with dust. The net curtain at the window was black, it was so dirty. There were accretions of brown grime in all the corners of the bathroom, and only lukewam water would come out of the faucets. The room adjoined the disgusting 'Janet's Bar' (a gloomy little shack under separate ownership, but next door) - and they held 'singalongs' until 1 - 2 a.m. Every word was audible thorugh the paper-thin walls. I got NO sleep at all.I could not check out because my friend was also staying in a separate room, and she had flown into the country to see me. So I insisted on moving room. Second room was also grubby, shabby, dusty; but not noisy. Found BUGS crawling on the bed. I have captured one and am sending it to Environmental Health. I suspect it to be a cockroach.Do not go to this hotel! It is a doss house."
24,595,"Aug 17 2006 	Excellent stay!	We stayed in the Brompton hotel for 3 nights. I booked the hotel through laterooms.com even though I had seen some positive and negative reviews of the hotel on this site.Our stay was great. The location of the hotel is excellent, just next to the South Kensington tube station. Everything in the hotel was clean and looked new. I think they have done some renovations lately. The double room we had was not too small and the bathroom was very clean and of a comfortable size. I can recommend this hotel to everybody."
25,595,"Aug 14 2006 	BED BUGS!!!	Booked 2 double bedrooms on 13 of August 2006 (Saturday). Receptionist was very helpful. Rooms are very small. Except one little thing...bed bugs.Woke up around 3 at night because right foot got itchy. Didn't pay much attention to it (should have). Next morning I had my both legs, whole back and chest covered in light pink spots of different sizes and shapes. Found 2 redish 5mm bed bugs in bed. Went to the bathroom and to my surprise found 3rd bug in the sink.Next afternoon I met hotel manager who at first refused to refund full amount of money for 2 double bedrooms. 15 minutes later I got my money.On next day pink spots turned into red (Sunday). The whole day felt dizzy and had a pain in right hand.I'm seeing a GP very shorlty and post back if have more news."
26,595,"Aug 8 2006	I had serious problems with a faulty window which crushed my finger	I found the staff seriously unhelpful - after I crushed my finger through an improperly secured hotel room window, which necessitated a trip to the Chelsea and Westminter hospital, hotel staff denied that the accident took place at the hotel, even though one of them took me from my room to a taxi; they refused to reimburse taxi fares to and from emergency dept of the hospital. Needless to say, I will never stay ther again."
27,595,"Jun 3 2006	Suited My Needs	I booked at the Brompton earlier this year before I had seen any of the poor reviews posted on this site. Well as far as I am concerned I received a warm welcome. The room was clean and quite spacious. asked for a mini safe and I got it with no problems. Tea making facilities and a fridge included.....well enough for my needs. The staff were curtious at all times. Can't say that I was worried by any noise from the traffic outside. The breakfast certainly leaves much to be desired. I would have been quite happy to pay an extra couple of pounds and have a decent breakfast,a snotty boiled egg really does nothing for me, no big deal, an excellent cheap cafe just around the corner. But having said that, the location is perfect. Close to the tube station. A Post Office and Internet Cafe accross the road and an abundance of good restaurants in close proximity. And for my purposes, the Royal Albert Hall just a 10 minute stroll up the road. Pity there is no lift. I will consider staying there again. The price is right!"
28,595,"Apr 20 2006	views	What a wonderful stay i had at brompton hotel. it was the birthday of my wife..i've stayed for 3 nights...i'll definitely come back...i'd arrive early in the morning ...nearly 7am to our surprise the room was ready...the room was a bit small but very romantique..breakfast in the room, a little table with 2 chairs...wonderful..besides room giving on the street the sunshine in the room..what a nice stay i had...besides it's in the most rich district in london...harrods 7 mins walking..all the fashion shops very near..buses and underground 1 min walking..we have a trip in the city everyday till late at night by bus andto our surprise, the transport system was excellent. i'll definitely recommend this hotel to any one"
29,595,"Feb 28 2006	Excellent stay!	Our stay in this hotel was OK: the rooms are clean even if small. But is ideal for reach easily any zone of London.The breakfast is coffee, toast and eggs, but served in the room: I like eat in my room in the morning.The day when we leave very early in the morning, the staff served us the breakfast at 5,40! Thank you!"
30,595,"Jan 28 2006	poor hotel indeed	what a relief to be home after a nightmare stay in this hotel.We checked in with a rude receptionist,who literally threw the keys at us.Upon entering this shoe box, we encountered the en-suite bathroom (freezing cold) and a patio door which was difficult to close.The breakfast is average and would recommend you seek another eaterie...."
31,595,"Jan 19 2006	What else could go wrong?	This was my second time staying at the hotel. The first time was for only one night and I was barely there to even really experience the hotel. Seemed clean and in a fairly good location. Second time my mother met me in London and we had the worst customer service,etc. The room was filthy, several items in the room did not work, they never brought our breakfast and forgot to give us our wake up call so we missed our train to Paris. I've just never had so many things go wrong. I also tried to deal with a refund from the owner for one of the nights stay because of the horrible experience and was basically told that he didn't care if he lost my future business or if I told anyone else not to stay there. I have never experienced such horrible customer service and I am not the type of person to usually ever complain unless it's something horrible like we experienced. I will never stay at this hotel again."
32,595,"Jun 16 2005	Good Location......	My partner and I stayed one night. The hotel is in a fantastic location but the rooms were well below average. The room was dark and the lamps didnt work. The bathroom was small with cracked and broken tiles (a bit dangerous. Someone could easily cut themselves or fall). The shower was awful..... the temperature kept changing and the water came out in a single trickle. I ended up going from burning myself to freezing cold.The breakfast was OK for a snack but we went out and had a later breakfast elsewhere.....The parking is a few blocks away at a charge of 3 per hour!! If you go on a weekend try to arrive after 1.30pm and secure a park on the street for free. You can stay there until Monday morning for no charge.... But be aware those parks are hard to get. You are better off to catch the tube as the station is right across from the hotel.If you just want somewhere basic for a sleep which is in a great location, this hotel is fine.... Mind you there are cheaper options available which are a better quality of hotel."
33,595,"Apr 14 2005 	I won't be back	I stayed there last night and am sat at my desk feeling dirty. The sheets weren't clean and the bathroom stank. This morning I had no running hot water in the sink and no water at all in the shower. I had a shave in cold water and then called reception who said they'd fix it. They must have flicked a switch as the hot water in the sink started to work. Not so in the shower which was still useless. Someone came up to my room, had a look at it and said &quot;not to worry&quot; before strolling off to fetch me a key for another room. As this was two floors up I had to get dressed before going upstairs to have my shower (which was like standing in a light drizzle). The bathroom in the second room smelt worse than the first.The staff were pleasant but that didn't count for much. I stayed there to get a good night's sleep. I was there 8 hours in all and that was 8 hours too many.All in all, spend a few more pounds and stay somewhere decent!"
34,595,"Feb 21 2005	Dreadful and arrogant in treatment of potential clients	Avoid this hotel - appalling treatment when the need to cancel a one night booking 48 hours in advance in mid winter occurred - refusal to respond to emails, insistence on charging full rate when illness prevented our visit - do not go near a place which has such disregard and high mindedness in its manner."
35,595,"Feb 9 2005	Good location if you don't mind being in a cell	Stayed at the Brompton in December 2004. Room was very basic, very small but spotlessly clean. Bathroom was also very clean, but the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in my life. Location is excellent. Loads of restaurants nearby and just around the corner from the tube. Breakfast which was delivered to our room consisted of tea, toast and a boiled egg - which was fine for us.  On the whole, I don't think I would return - mainly because I have stayed in better hotels in London - but obviously paid extra for the luxury"
36,595,"Dec 26 2004	A Great location in London	Even if our double room were small and there is no lounge in the hotel, we have a excellent stay. We were on the first floor so the stairs were not a problem. Great reception ! The staff were very friendly and helpful. They told us some good restaurants and they keep our lungage in the hotel when we live the room till we got the plane. The hotel is ideally located near the tuble, the post office, museums, restaurants ..."
37,595,Jul 12 2004	Lots of stairs but good location	The Brompton is in a great location for anyone arriving in London via Gattwick. The South Kensington tube station is literally across the street and it's on the same line as Victoria. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable but small. The breakfast isn't much but it gets you started. The staff are neither friendly or rude. The price goes down in the off season and it's easy to book online.
38,595,"Feb 10 2004	good value	It wasn't quite as nice as the pictures; everything was small--the room, the TV, the shower-- but clean and comfortable; no elevator; our room on the third/fourth floor. Staff was friendly. Only issue was the room was too hot at night (~74 o F.) even with the radiator off and the windows open (&lt;50 o outside!)--must have been the room below us.VERY well located (100 yards from South Kensington tube); can walk to V&amp;A and other museums and Harrods; cheap and seemed safe. Jan, 2004."
39,595,"Jun 15 2003	Who Said the Brompton was a Great Place?	After reading some good reviews about this place, we booked Brompton Hotel for three nights in June 2003. The only good thing I can say is it was close to the underground. The hotel is more like a rooming house. There is a flight of steep stairs you need to climb to get to the reception (which is a small desk in the stairwell) and we had to climb an additional 3 flights to our room. The hotel is really only rooms, there is no sitting area or small breakfast room. Also there is no air conditioning and the room was noisy (as you had to open the window to get some air). The room was alright but the breakfast tray delivered to our room each morning was the same-boiled eggs, hard toast and tea or coffee.I had read in reviews that staff were helpful in providing good tourist information-but not the ones that were on duty during our stay. They knew nothing and were not helpful at all. They weren't even friendly in the least.I would never stay at this hotel again-given all the better places to stay for the price."
40,595,"Dec 4 2002	One of the best locations in London!	The Brompton Hotel is a lovely, clean and safe hotel located in South Kensington. It is only 3 minutes on foot from the South Kensington &quot;tube&quot; (subway) station which makes it extremely easy to navigate to anyplace in London. Also within easy walking distance are Kensington Palace and Gardens, Hyde Park, The Victoria and Albert Museum and Royal Albert Hall to name just a few.There are great shops, restaurants and pubs located in the area as well. The friendly staff went out of their way to see that we were comfortable and had everything we needed and made several excellent recommendations on places to eat. (Try the fantastic Indian restaurant just one block from the hotel! Superb! Sorry I can't remember the name though.) The continental breakfast (egg, toast, marmalade, coffee/tea) was delivered to our room every morning at whatever hour we chose. There is no elevator in the hotel but it wasn't really a problem for us. We were on the 4th floor but managed just fine. Also, there is no air conditioning, but again, that's not really a problem in London on most occasions. We were there in the summer and just opened the window and the staff brought us a large fan to use when needed. I can't say enough good things about the Brompton Hotel. It was safe for two women travelling alone (I was travelling with my sister-in-law), extremely clean and the rate was excellent. I recommend the Brompton highly and am planning to stay there on my next trip to London in the spring."

1,596,"Nov 24 2009 	Lovely stay	My husband and I stayed here as we were seeing a show at the Hammersmith Apollo. The reception staff were excellent and the room was lovely. The room had tea &amp; coffee facilities which was nice. Our room was at the front overlooking the main road and the green. We had no trouble with traffic or noise and we both said we would definately stay here again. The bar was also nice as was our meal, which at 20 for 2 mains and a bottle of wine was a bargain. Breakfast was awful - we waited an hour and it was like it had been cooked in a microwave - the sausage looked raw. Hope this helps.Lisa"
2,596,"Oct 31 2009 	Refurbished Victorian gem	The Brook Green pub and hotel have been recently refurbished by the looks. The bar has been done in a strange colour, reminiscent of the colours bar ceiling used to turn from the nicotine stains and maybe that's the point. The bedrooms though have been tastefully refurbished, with a modern feel, including wall mounted flat screen TVs, whilst retaining the large Victorian windows and high ceilings. The staff are friendly, and the cooked breakfast was excellent on the first day and good on the second (depends on the chef?). This is actually a surpisingly convenient location, maybe ten minutes walk from the Hammersmith tube stations, whilst King Street is packed with ethnic restaurants - try 101 Thai at 352 King St - a small but very authentic Thai restaurant. The Thames is only a short walk away, and makes for a very pleasant riverside stroll along the Thames Path down to Barns bridge, from where you can get a bus back to Hammersmith station.Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, which was good value in nicely refurbished rooms. However, if staying at the Brook Green, it is on a busy road and the noise from the pub - both music from the bar below and people out on the street out front, made sleeping difficult before the pub closed at 1am - there is an obvious solution though - have a pint in the bar! Our room was not made up during our stay, but since this was only two nights it didn't matter and could be argued that daily room make ups are excessive. There was no soap in the room, although there were other shower items so this may have been an oversight - we'd brought our own anyway.All in all a good value stay in nicely refurbished rooms in a convenient location in the capital. Just be aware of the noise issues if that is a concern to you."
3,596,"Jan 28 2009 	Fantasic Food	I recently had the privalage of staying at the brook green for 3 nights the staff were friendly helpful and efficent, The food is outsatanding with new chefs on board cooking, i would recommed staying and dinning there or just popping in for a pint."
4,596,"Dec 4 2007 	Take your earplugs	We stayed in this hotel for three nights. The location is handy to public transport. The ambience in the bar is nice. The staff were mostly young expatriates who were really friendly. Our room overlooked Shepherds Bush Road. We felt as if we were bombarded by sirens, with the fire station being very close, and the road being frequented by ambulances and police cars that had their sirens blaring at all hours. This did not make for restful sleep. Neither did hard beds. Our room needed quite a bit of maintenance - one power point didn't work, only one of three bathroom lights was functional, the shower leaked onto the end of the bath and water flowed from there to make a lake on the bathroom floor, and the main stairwell light was also not functioning. Housekeeping hadn't removed all of the previous occupants' rubbish and during our stay didn't once clean or replace our water glasses or tea cups - we had to clean them ourselves. We expected a bath towel each but didn't always get this and had to ask for more, although there were enough hand towels. Our room keys seemed programmed to work only once - we were having to get them reprogrammed several times each day. The breakfast menu runs from 7am till noon which is good for a sleep-in, but the standard of food is patchy."
5,596,"Jul 24 2007 	Great Value and Location	The Brook Green was a breath of fresh air, literally. The hotel rooms are above a busy pub, but extremely well isolated acoustically. In addition, our stay was during one of those heatwaves that are allegedly rare in Britain, but seem to strike every time I visit. The room was not huge, but had gorgeous high ceilings and quiet, cool air conditioning. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom very well appointed. The proprietors were friendly and this made a great place to stay the final night of our sojourn."
6,596,"Aug 7 2006 	Great place away from the crowds but close enough to the city	Stayed for 3 nights this July. Great location (within 5 minutes walk of the Hammersmith Station) and great neighborhood with several excellent ethnic restaurants. The pub and hotel are very clean and air-conditioned. The breakfast is excellent, and the staff are very helpful. Great value."
1,599,Mar 14 2007 	good location	excellent location 5-10 min walk from the marble arch tube station. Small
2,599,Feb 20 2007	Shabby	Having stayed in the UK many times previously
3,599,Feb 20 2007	one night was enough	Stayed one night recently and that was enough .The hotel is very tired and worn out 
4,599,Mar 4 2006	New Year's Eve '05	My friend and I arrived in London for New Year's Eve with no prior reservations. We knew after the New Year's Day had been rung in we'd be sleeping in the train station or park if we couldn't find a room.After consulting my Frommer's Guide (another great gift idea) we found this reasonably priced location just up from Big Ben and the Thames.For 79 pounds we got a room with its own bath
5,599,Feb 16 2006	Regretable	Stayed there for five days considering it would be our best option - We were awfully wrong! The location is far from everywere that might interest a tourist
6,599,Dec 19 2005 	look elsewhere	I would have to agree with the other reviewer that apart from the location there is really nothing much good to say about the place. The building is old and apparently poorly maintained. Its almost impossible to get a good night's sleep with the racket from the plumbing (if anyone in the same building flushes their toilet you can forget about quiet for the next 10 minutes) and creaking of floors. The service also leaves much to be desired. The hotel is not cheap but one gets the idea that they are doing you a favor by just letting you stay there
7,599,Nov 10 2005	Nothing good except location	I visited the Bryanston court hotel at April 2005 with my wife. I chose the hotel mainly because it is a 5 minutes walk from Marble Arch &amp; Oxford - a very good location.Nothing else could explain the high price (160$). We spent few hours going up &amp; down to the reception - there were 3 beds instead of 2 in the room for some reason. The TV remote control didn't work. The toilet didn't work properly. The heat didn't work &amp; the window couldn't stay open - you had to put a piece of wood to keep the window open
8,599,Jun 29 2005	An OK place	My wife and I stayed at the Bryanston Court Hotel for six days. We had lived in London for three years literally across the street from the hotel and were back for a visit. We stayed at the hotel due to its great location near Oxford Street and Hyde Park
1,600,Sep 29 2009 	all promise no delivery	i booked a twin room was given a double and foldout settee complained next day was told that was what i had booked even though .i had my booking form stating a twin . and was more or less told tough .the noise outside at night was likr living on a street with a bunch of getto blasters partying youths and car horns when i mentioned this was told it was not usualy lke this . only when i told them i was going to contact head office was some thing done .they offed me a camp bed .ha ha . then a twin room turned up from now where and we were put in the basement out of site out of mind .the room was not used very often has it had cobbwebs on the ceiling and the back of the settee and the lights had to be kept on even during the day because it was so dark .the bathroom had bits of tiles missing on the floor and yhe list goes on
2,600,"Sep 9 2009 	Very nice hotel good location	We really liked this hotel. The rooms are quite big. If you are staying for a while, the kitchenette could be helpful. The staff were friendly and answered our questions. The location is nice because you can walk down to Soho, Covent Garden, and Trafalgar in about 15 mins or so. If I stayed in London again, I think I would try to get a hotel more in Trafalgar or Leicester square. However, this location is still very good, especially with the British museum just down the street. I wouldn't have their breakfast, as there are cheaper places around."
3,600,"Sep 2 2009 	Disgraceful booking practice.	We booked the Buckingham through lastminute.com after much internet searching.We arrived and were told that we had been &quot;allocated&quot; a room that was actually in the Clarendon hotel next door.We did not complain at the time as we were tired and were assured that the room was of similar standard.After our stay we discovered that in fact we could have booked a standard double room at the Clarendon for considerably less money. We were not offered any refund of the difference in price and consequently feel deceived and cheated. Apparently, this booking practice is perfectly normal at this hotel. They obviously accept bookings for the Buckingham from various places like lastminute.com and once they have your money they simply &quot;allocate&quot; rooms at their other, presumably less desirable, hotels.We will not be booking any Grange hotels in the future and our advice to you is the same."
4,600,"Jul 14 2009 	Great Hotel Great Location No air conditioning	We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in early July. The location is its best attribute. Very cute, quiet, townhouse, street, but very central. Less than one block from Russell Square with lots of stores and restaurants. 5-10 minute walk to Covent Garden and the Strand. Around the corner from the British Museum. We had a room on the first floor looking out on the Garden. The room was large, clean and beautifully furnished with a small kitchenette and a new marble bathroom. The king bed was very comfortable. There was a flat screen HDTV with cable service- great for watching the tennis finals. Unfortunately we arrived in London during an unusual heat wave - 95 degrees. Our room was NOT air conditioned and had very little ventilation even with the window wide open- it was hot! Our window was right next to the breakfast room kitchen so the noise of dishes and food prep started at 6:30AM. It was hard to keep the window open. The hotel provided a fan which improved things slightly. If you are visiting in the summer, I would request a room on a higher floor, looking out on the street. There is hardly any traffic on this street and the breeze seems to come from this direction. The breakfast room is very small so you may not get a table. The hotel breakfast is very expensive anyway so we ate at one of the many restaurants in the area. Try Brunswick center (near the Russell Square tube stop)- many great restaurants and cafes with outdoor seating. It also has a Waitrose supermarket with great prepared foods, wines, beers, and the usual other stuff. If you have a car, there is underground parking one block away for 25 gbp per 24 hours. All day Sunday you can park right in front of the hotel for free. Other times there is a paymeter - 4 gbp per hour. If your looking for a small hotel with character, great rooms, good service on a quiet street this is a great choice. Overall I believe this hotel is a great value in a terrific location."
5,600,Jun 24 2009 	Definitely would Stay Again	My room was huge and clean. It was kinda old school decorations but that may just be classic English decor (no offense!). The room was updated and very nice. I just loved how big it was. Not too many TV channels but no big deal. I can't remember if there was wifi bc I didn't have a laptop but internet access was only one computer at a sister hotel two doors down. The staff was incredibly helpful and planned some of my travels around England for me! Location was all right for the few places that I was going to. Was only there for 2 nights. Paid 100 quid (for all you unfamialir with Brisith that just bucks)a night it was a good value since most places are a lot more expensive. Would definitely stay again!
6,600,"Apr 10 2009 	Great location good value	Stayed for midweek break with wife and 2 children. Excellent family room, 2 double beds plus bed settee which was not required for sleeping. Brilliant location for visiting theatres which we came for. On first day small dining room was full but we were relocated to sister hotel across the street for breakfast and no problems.Bathroom could be a bit more tidy but how particular do you want to be?Definitely recommend"
7,600,"Mar 21 2009 	Peace comfort excellent value	I stayed in this hotel for three nights while my son was in a local hospital. For the quality of the accomodation, I thought that this hotel was excellent value. During the same week we stayed in another nearby hotel which was part of an international hotel chain. The price was virtually the same, but the room at the Buckingham was three times the size, far more luxuriously decorated, and also the bathroom was at least twice the size of the other hotel and far better equipped (my bathroom had a bath with shower over, as well as a separate shower). The hotel provides a wide selection of magazines in each room, as well as a complimentary newspaper or my choice each morning - as well as some other 'free' finance &amp; general papers. There is a small 'lounge bar' and breakfast area. Full English breakfast is about 20, Continental is 17, however you do not need to have either of these, as each room contains a mini kitchen area, with fridge, sink, microwave, kettle, china &amp; cutlery, so you can stock up with all you need to prepare your breakfast yourself. (There are several supermarkets in the area including a superb 'Waitrose' in the Brunswick Centre nr. Russel Square Underground station, and a Sainsburys and Tescos Express in Southampton Row/High Holborn. The room also contains a flat screen TV, music player , wireless or wired internet access. My room (Number 4) was a basement room, overlooking the lovely quiet gardens at the back of the hotel. Because of this location I did not experience any of the normal city traffic noise - I was awoken by the sound of the birds in the trees in the gardens. Amazing for a city-centre hotel. The hotel is in the centre of the 'Bloomsbury' area of London, a few yards from the British Museum, near several important hospitals, and about 10 minutes walk from Covent Garden and London's 'Theatre District'. In Southampton Row and Covent Garden there are literally hundreds of different restaurants catering to all tastes. I have also previously stayed in another 'Grange' hotel, the Holborn, which is a 5 star. It was a very nice hotel, but at the Buckingham had a bigger room and it was in a much quieter location, at a (much) lower price. I would definately recommend the Buckingham &amp; will stay there again."
8,600,Feb 8 2009 	Horrible customer service- AVOID at ALL Costs	We booked a family vacation in October. Had to change dates to November. We called the hotel and cancelled our room months in advance. They charged our credit card anyway for one night and fought us on the charge. We finally paid it but my recommedation is to AVOID The Buckingham and the Grange hotel chain at ALL costs. We finally stayed at the Renassiance Chancery Court ...a wonderful hotel.
9,600,"Jan 21 2009 	Very good	Stayed here for one night in Dec as we were attending a wedding in central London. Hotel was in a great location, a stones throw from British Museum and about 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden. The road its in is quite and there is an underground carpark at the end of the road in bloomsbury square, parking is pricey but It is in London generally.Room was great, nice clean and spacious with a fridge and microwave in a kitchenette type space. Although we were only there for one night it would be ideal for anyone visiting London for a holiday."
10,600,"Sep 4 2008 	Wonderful rooms and lovely and quiet	This place exceeded my expectations which I admit were already quite high after seeing the pictures on their website. The rooms were wonderfully large, light and airy and really well appointed. Having a sink, microwave and fridge in the room, discretely hidden away is a real bonus. The bathroom was of a good size too and really well laid out, smart and clean with avery effective shower.The lounge area was very comfortable and again very light and open.I stay in hotels in London very regularly and this is probably the best so far. It was one of those hotels where I regretted that my stay was just for the one night."
11,600,"Jul 12 2008 	Peace in the city	This hotel is situated in a quiet residential street in Bloomsbury, where one wouldn't realise one is in the middle of a large city, yet still close to many sights.The staff, all of whom came from abroad, were very friendly and brought us things like ice cubes and a sewing kit within minutes. The Buckingham belongs to a chain of Hotels all in the same street, so many things, such as the concierge, had to shuttle between the houses. We arrived in our car and the hotel offered no parking. We parked in the nearby secured Bloomsbury Square carpark, where hotel guests received a discount (we were informed of this by the carpark, not the hotel staff, when leaving!).We didn't have breakfast at the Buckingham, as the price of 18 pounds for continental breakfast and 22 pounds for English breakfast seemed somewhat exaggerated! (By the way, all prices displayed are net !)The room was very spacious and included a kitchenette and ironing facilities. The bathroom was very modern and also large. The decor was somewhat uninspired (hotel standard) but of a high quality nonetheless. The room we had was on the ground floor and faced the garden, meaning that we could sleep in the city centre with the sash window wide open - great!"
12,600,"Apr 8 2008 	good value	We chose this area of London as we were coming from Paris on the Eurostar and it was relatively close to St Pancras station. The price quoted on the website was very reasonable compared to other hotels in London. We were pleasantly surprised to find a very spacious room with fireplace, two chairs in a sitting area, and a small kitchenette. The location is just around the corner from the British Museum and very close to two tube stations. There is not a lot in the way of restaurants in the area but you can easily go elsewhere on the tube. Had a nice meal in the Museum Pub and had a good continental breakfast in the hotel. This came with the reservation or you could order a full breakfast at the posted price."
13,600,"Jan 25 2008	so spacious	We went to London for the New Year. We booked a studio.It had a large double bed, which was very comfortable.There was also a bed settee for the children. There was a cupboard that contained a full sized fridge, sink, microwave, kettle and crockery.The bathroom was quite spacious and had toiletries.We booked it through their website which had good rates and included breakfast. There was a good selection of cereal, fruit juices, toast, and tea of coffee.The only thing that was wrong is you had to go next door to The Claredon Hotel for breakfast.Overall our stay felt like luxury, the staff were very helpful and couldnt do enough for us."
14,600,"Jan 8 2008 	Very nice hotel. Great choice	Very nice hotel with a great location. Staff very friendly and helpful. The room was very spacious and comfortable compared to the average in London. Very good value for the money I paid. I travel a lot to London for business purpose and definitely, I will stay again in the same hotel."
15,600,"Dec 1 2007	Very nice stay	I stayed at the Buckingham during a quick business trip to London, and chose the hotel from an on-line travel site mainly for its proximity to my meetings and its cost. The location is excellent and I appreciated being in close proximity (both via Tube and walking) to many desired locations, while still being in a relatively quiet part of central London. My first room was a bit on the small side, judging by American standards. However, due to problems with the internet connection in my first room, I was moved to a much larger room for the remainder of my stay. I would like to note that both rooms were very comfortable, extremely clean, and I appreciated the built-in fridge/microwave/sink features. This hotel shares restaurant/bar/business center services with its sister hotels down the townhouse row. I found this arrangement to be rather charming and not at all problematic, howevever, others might find it inconvenient to walk two doors down to access breakfast or the business center. Within a couple of blocks are coffee shops, convenience stores and grocers, and decent restaurants, depending on your preference/taste. As I mentioned earlier, the Holburn and Russell Sq. tube stops are within a 5 min. walk, so the rest of London is easily accessible. At this time, with the lousy exchange rate of the US dollar to the UK pound, I felt that the Buckingham was a very good value. I would stay there again, however, I would request one of the larger rooms, if available.In closing, I would like to commend the staff for their responsiveness to my needs, especially in regard to problems connecting to the high speed internet from my room. The staff were very kind and accommodating, and I felt like I received the same level of personalized service as I would have at the Hilton or other larger chain."
16,600,"May 18 2007 	A week stay at the Buckingham	Stayed for 6 nights at the Grange Buckingham. Have heard of contrasting reviews on the hotel, but my stay was fine and pleasant. At 195 pounds per night, wouldn't consider it a steal, but it was worth it as the room was huge and clean. The bathroom was a surpriseas it's rather well furnished and modern, e.g. at least the sink tap was the mixer type, unlike some of the London hotels I stayed previously. The room had a useful kitchenette, which was equipped with a microwave oven and fridge - great for heating up TV dinners as dining out is rather expensive. I felt the service was great, and there's change of bedlinen daily. Then again, maybe that's because my family and I preferred to be left alone most of the time. The place was quiet. Location was pretty good, with the British Museum next door, and the Tottenham Court and shopping belt about 20 mins walk. Nearest Tube station is Euston, which is like 10 mins walk. Across the tube station is Sainsbury supermarket which you can get most of the TV dinners. From Euston to Covent garden is only 1-2 tube stops.Overall, it's a reasonable stay and recommended for family with youngkids. The room size is something which you'll be hard pressed to find in Central London."
17,600,"Jan 5 2007 	Never got past the lobby	My husband and I were booked for a stay at the Buckingham in early December 2006 by a travel agent. We had a confirmed reservation with a number. When we arrived at the hotel after the all-night flight from NY, we were told by the front desk receptionist that our reservation had been cancelled by our travel agent while we were en route. Since our cell phone did not have service in London, we asked to use the phone in the hotel to confirm this (the travel agent was located in England.) The receptionist politely informed us that we could use a pay phone in the street around the corner. We were obviously distressed and exhausted, so I found this incredibly inconsiderate. My husband was assured by the agent that the reservation was valid, but numerous phone calls between the agency and the hotel proved pointless as they refused to honor the reservation. Be forwarned that Grange Hotels accepts reservations for rooms they do not have, and will not make good if this is the case. Thankfully we were able to book into another hotel by Hyde Park, the Commodore, which I would recommend."
18,600,"Dec 2 2006 	Service was horrible and dirtly room !	We stayed in this hotel for 2 days since we had appointments for work in central london. Well I did not have any expectation from this place since I knew it was almost in some alley in central london totally not connected or any bars or restaurents around ( thanks god for the Suv we had rented with gps.)What was horrendous was that early moorning after we checked in there were loud noise of banging and hammering . After we woke up startled - found out we were given the room right next to the part of the building which was getting constructed and when asked WHY they did not even apolozise or help us get any other room. Also the smallest of things were not there- No adaptors , No creamer for coffee....if you asked for ketchup..-the lady said they have run out of it..!!!!It was just very frustrating!I would not want anyone to go thru this !"
19,600,Mar 21 2005	Convenient and Quiet!	My wife and I just came back from our trip to Europe. We stayed at the Grange Buckingham in the Bloomsbury section of London from 3/11/5 to 3/15/5. We were surprised at how spacious the room was. It even had a couch and two chairs. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath tub. The hotel is centrally located. The Holburn tube station is nearby as is the British Museum. This place is very quiet. You wouldn't even know that you're in Central London. There is no bar/lounge or restaurant but that wouldn't stop us from staying there again. Cheerio!
20,600,"Jan 11 2005 	V. Close to the British Museum	The Buckingham is part of the Grange Bloomsbury Townhouse collection. It is a fair deal as it has a fridge and microwave - and the larger rooms are v. spacious (but are quite noisy at night). And, the small rooms are v. small. The beds are hard but bathrooms are above avg. A decent deal if not paying too much....and if you want to be close to the Museum and Library. Would suggest looking a little harder for something else if given the time."
21,600,Sep 30 2009 	hotel agrable pour un sjour de 4 nuits
22,600,Jul 21 2008 	Mitten in London und doch recht ruhig!
1,602,"Nov 25 2009 	Good Location / Comfortable Room / Big Bathroom	Stayed at Cadogan on recent trip and was pleased. Room was large and had big bathroom. Staff was very nice. Good location between Knightsbridge and Sloane Square Tube stations. Bus Stops also close by for easy access to all areas. Chairs in room were on small side and could be bigger for more comfort when you want to sit and read. Had Flat Screen TV. Comfortable Bed. Free Business Center Computer access. Overall, a good value for a nice hotel."
2,602,Nov 23 2009 	An elegant hotel	You cannot go wrong at the Cadogan if you're looking to experience a great hotel in a prime location. The shops of Knightsbridge are just around the corner....
3,602,"Nov 3 2009 	Outstanding service great location and familiar ambience.	We stayed in the Cadogan for a weekend getaway with the kids. The hotel is beautiful and cozy with its Drawing room and Cadogan Bar decorated with wonderful pictures, the rooms are spatious and comfortable thouhg a bit oldish.The best highlight of the hotel is the service. We were treated like at home in this boutique hotel where every member of the staff is friendly and welcoming and made our stay an unforgettable one. It is highly recommendable to enjoy their afternoon tea and to visit the Langtrys restaurant where the scottish influence on their menu is surprisingly great.We liked the ambience and the service the best while the rooms decor and status could be slightly improved."
4,602,"Oct 14 2009 	Style and service @ the Cadogan Sloan St.	Having previously stayed at the Cadogan last year, it was with a certain trepidation that I set forth to London, believing that the enjoyment of my previous visit could not possibly be equalled. How unnecessary that was. Indeed it would be fair to say that this second visit did not equal the first but in fact surpassed it, Let me explain. From the moment that I stepped from the cab and was greeted by a smiling concierge called Richie till the time that the ever helpful Stella at reception completed my checkout I could not have wished for a more completely relaxing quality experience. My bags were taken and I was accompanied to my room which I found very clean, spacious and most comfortably appointed. Wi-Fi access was free and very speedy. (What a pleasant surprise these days) There is also a traditional turndown service with the next days weather forecast supplied, nice touch. Next morning breakfast was delivered bang on time with my previously ordered daily paper. What a great breakfast spread!! Small details perhaps but they provide the little touches that made my stay something extra special. This tranquil and tastefully decorated hotel is in a fabulous central London location close to Harrods with countless restaurants and upmarket shopping opportunities within easy walking distance. Transport needs are well served with a traditional bus stop adjacent to the hotel and with Knightsbridge tube 5 minutes walk away. Any other transport requirements are routinely and professionally dealt with via Joe and Richie at the concierge desk. If there is a more friendly and informative pair in London Ive yet to find them. If they cant get you a table or a ticket no one can.The Bar and Restaurant were well up to their previously set high standards with polite, swift and attentive service. All this and I havent yet even mentioned the Cadogans Oscar Wilde connection, Google it for yourself. On comparing this visit with my last one when I met Mr Gallo the General Manager, I think its safe to say that one could feel his experienced hand on the tiller of this tightly run luxury ship.All too soon the time to return to Bonnie Scotland had arrived and as I was assisted into my cab I rued the fact that even Edinburghs finest cannot compete with this London Gem."
5,602,Oct 1 2009 	A definate way to relax and enjoy london	I stayed at the cadogan recently and what a hotel the service and friendliness that we recieved from arriving to departing was outstanding and I will definatley be coming back again.
6,602,"Sep 27 2009 	Home away from Home	I have stayed at The Cadogan both for business and on a family vacations and every time the service has been uniquely personal and warm, in way that cannot be acheived by coporate properties close by. The restaurant has an excellent take on modern british cuisine that even wins over italians and spanish."
7,602,"Sep 19 2009 	Great Boutique Hotel in a Prime Location	You cannot go wrong at the Cadogan if you're looking to experience a great hotel in a prime location. The shops of Knightsbridge are just around the corner, and Sloane Street provides many more shopping opportunities. There is a tube stop at Sloane Square, so getting around London is very easy. The staff are delightful. After business meetings in the afternoon, I was ready for a cup of tea and the service in the lounge was excellent. They also offer a proper afternoon tea for those that want sandwiches and cakes. We had drinks in the bar after returning from dinner, and the same warm service was provided. The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful and welcoming, and provided umbrellas when needed!The sleeping room was a double. It's not the biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in, but was well appointed and had plenty of room to store two suitcases in a closet. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom offered all the amenities one would expect. The heated towel rail is something every bathroom should have!If you want to stay away from the large chain hotels and experience something a little more British, I highly recommend the Cadogan. In true London style, the hotel also has an interesting history, which adds to the character of the property. Stay here, and you won't be disappointed."
8,602,"Sep 18 2009 	Home from Home	My husband and I have stayed at the Cadogan Hotel twice, sometimes three times a year since 2002. I would describe the hotel as discrete, calm, comfortable, cosy, central and elegant. It is located at a prestigious Knightsbridge address. Beyond the walls are the chic shops, Kings Road, West End, museums, galleries, great restaurants and Hyde Park. However, within the walls, one can relax and experience excellent but unobtrusive service.Assitant Head Concierge Richie Long, looks after our every need. This includes making sure Gluten free bread is ordered for me, a service one would find impossible in most modern chain hotels. He is efficient, cheerful and forever thoughtful. We travel from Dublin to London by boat and train, arriving exhausted. We always quickly recover at our home from home.We would recommend our favourite London hotel to anyone thinking of planning a visit to the city."
9,602,Sep 13 2009 	Felt like home!! Amazing	I highly recommend this hotel due to its ideal location and quirky interior. The rooms are quite spacious and comfortable. Everything is within walking distance. London is much lovelier now that I know Cadogan Hotel exists. This hotel will make your stay worthwhile.
10,602,"Sep 8 2009 	English elegance	We were a little early so couldn't check-in to our room, but concierge kindly stored our bag for us, while we explored the local area. Sloane Street is packed with designer shops (Gucci, Armani etc) but I quickly marched my wife past to have lunch at Harvey Nicks. We returned to find that we had been up-graded to a junior suite, which turned out to be huge, with 2 bathrooms and a massive bed. We were celebrating our anniversary so a knock on the door with champagne delivered to the room was a lovely surprise. The staff were all so cheerful and helpful, we felt like Royalty, which bearing in mind the Royal connections this hotel has made a lot of sense. We were going out for dinner at Maze and found it easy to get a taxi right outside the front door of the hotel. The following day we woke up to a full English breakfast and my wife tried eggs benedict, both of which were delicious. There is a welcoming feel to this hotel, which really added to our trip to London."
11,602,"Sep 2 2009 	Great Location and atmosphere	All round good experience. Service was great and staff were always willing to help and be of service. Lovely traditional feel to the hotel and in a great location concerning luxury brand shopping, Harrods and the night life of Knightsbridge and transport links. Cant really fault the hotel as my say was very good. I recommend!"
12,602,"Sep 1 2009 	WoW Just what you want to get out of a 5star Hotel	I stayed at the Cadogan in July and what a welcome i got when i walked in from the reception who mad check a breeze where i normaly hate it as there is always something wrong. Had a drink in the bar the first Night and the Barman Kevin was very friendly and made you feel like a friend. Breakfast in the morning is great with not a fault to be found, try there capacino its is the best. Next time im back i will give the restaurant a go for dinner with some friends as the have a great Wine dinner offer."
13,602,"Sep 1 2009 	Wonderful clean and attractive	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Cadogan for one night prior to taking a flight back to the states. We had arrived back in London from Paris much later than anticipated but the Cadogan staff was helpful and efficient in checking us in. We were settled into our spacious and comfortable room in no time. Our room had a lovely street view and was very quiet. The facilities were immaculate and the business center was very helpful in getting and printing out travel information. My only complaint is the location - we are both in our early twenties and tend to eat late dinners (around 9pm). It was a Sunday night and nearly impossible to find anything to eat in the vicinity. Really, a very small gripe as it's otherwise an incredibly safe location (and quite fancy to boot) which is very busy during the daylight hours. I would certainly stay here again!"
14,602,Aug 28 2009 	Simply Excellent	Great Hotel...Best Bar service...Amazing breakfast...Highly recommended...
15,602,"Aug 26 2009 	Cadogan is simply a leisure hotel	with prime location in the heart of London, friendly personnel and excelent and attentive F&amp;B service from the first step in, lovely and cosy feeling all make the this lovely Hotel my very favourate."
16,602,"Aug 15 2009 	Charming relaxing and convenient.	We stayed at the Codogan for a single night in June and had a lovely room to the back of the hotel. It was very quiet, comfortable and well equipped, with a great bathroom (with good quality toiletries). It was a sweltering day in London, getting back to the room it was nice to relax and be able to cool down with the AC on full blast, which fortunately worked well!We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening, but breakfast was lovely.The communal areas are very luxurious, but never too much, which is a breath of fresh air. As for the staff, they could not have been more helpful or welcoming, check in was efficient and the concierge very knowledgeable about best ways of getting around, places to visit, shopping etc, all of which the Hotel's location is ideal for.Overall, a very pleasant stay and will return to the Codogan for future trips to London."
17,602,"Jul 26 2009 	A great little hotel	I lived in London until I was twelve before moving to Spain and it keeps drawing me back.I stayed at the Cadogan recently with a friend on my sixth trip to London. I had stayed with friends before but they moved out to the country. The hotel feels like a club in some ways as you feel at home right away. The location is as good as it gets (away from the hustle and bustle) and it is easy to reach anywhere as the transport system is so good. The staff are so friendly, especially Ritchie who helped us so much. He is such a funny guy and could not do enough for us. He knows all the places of interest in this fantastic city and even made some suggestions not usually on the tourist trail. He also found us some tickets to a Hyde Park music festival so we got to see Bruce Springsteen. Magic! We did the centre on previous trips so were keen to do something different. Our trip on a river boat from Kingston to Hampton Court Palace was so memorable. We would also recommend Kew Gardens. Ritchie suggested both of these and several more that we could not fit in. We will just have to return!The hotel building is Victorian and it has so much character - very olde worlde. You almost expect to see Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in discussion in the drawing room. As for our room it was very comfortable with a good size bathroom. We chose to have breakfast at a bistro nearby as we thought it was a bit expensive in the hotel . All the prestige shops are just along from the hotel as you walk up to Knightsbridge and Harrods, a fantastic shop by the way. Sloane Square and the Kings Road are a short walk in the opposite direction. There is a garden square across from the hotel which guests can access and beyond that are some beautiful houses.All in all I would recommend the Cadogan to anyone who wants a small, convenient hotel with a special feel."
18,602,"Jul 23 2009 	Not a 5 Star Hotel	The service at the Cadogan is quite good. However, the entire experience, including the room quality and the quality of the bathroom is not what I would expect in a five star hotel. The hotel is, however, in a wonderful location."
19,602,"Jun 25 2009 	My place in London.	I stay at The Cadogan at least once a year and have done so since the '80's. I continue to find the overall service highly impressive, but most importantly, unobtrusive. The front desk is exceptionally helpful. I'm prompted to write a positive review after reading a highly negative one. Each traveler's expectations are unique. This place suits mine perfectly. I shall keep returning."
20,602,"Jun 21 2009 	High style in the heart of Kensington.	We booked our stay at this lovely spot with a package with our British Airways flight. Upon our arrival, we were upgraded to a bigger room, which was, despite the small bathroom, spacious and comfortable. Air-conditioning is now standard in most English hotels, regardless of size and ours worked just fine to keep us cool. This historic hotel is situated just minutes by foot from Knightsbridge tube, making it THE ideal location. With so many picturesque streets around and about, plus free access to the wonderful square across the road, who could really ask for more? They have a small gym and a computer room with printer, all free. Charm is this hotel's middle name. Richie, the very amusing and extremely helpful concierge at the front desk is a true delight. He took us to see Oscar Wilde's room (109), which is lovely. By doing this hotel as part of a package made it far more affordable than it would otherwise have been. Our room, 114, overlooked the side street, rather than the square in front of the hotel, but that suited us fine, as it's much quieter on the side street. And what a view! Magnificent houses to look out upon. No complaints to speak of, except for that small bathroom, but some rooms have much larger ones, depending on where the room is. Ask for a large bathroom when booking. We've stayed in many places in London, but this was the capstone to our experience in this amazing city. Not perfect, but then no place is. Just a lovely vibe and helpful staff to make your stay a romantic breeze."
21,602,"Jun 16 2009 	Wonderful week-end wonderful city and wonderful hotel!	This Hotel is located at few minutes from the Knightsbridge Station (underground), in the heart of London. I went to London for a long week-end with a friend of mine: it was my first time in London, and I think it could not have been better.The hotel was perfect. The staff was friendly, professional, very helpful and multilingual... they make you feel like home!Our room was very comfortable and clean. When we came back to the hotel after our first day LONDON-FULL-IMMERSION, we found a lovely fresh fruit basket and a bottle of Champagne welcoming us!!!Breakfast in the morning was really very good: there was a rich Buffet, and we really enjoyed the pancakes with maple syrup, strawberries and blackberries!PERFECT!"
22,602,"Jun 4 2009 	Style and service at your fingertips....	The Cadogan hotel has always had an infamous reputation for excellent service which is exactly what I experienced first hand when I stayed there for a relaxing weekend not so long ago. Not only is the hotel a beautiful Victorian building with stunning wooden beam features and high architectual ceilings which run throughout each room which is in turn complimented by a wonderful collection of old and contemporary artwork, the staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly which made my entire stay very peaceful and relaxing which is not so easy to find in the hustle and bustle of London city centre.I arrived in my room to be welcomed by a beautiful basket of assorted fresh fruit and I decided to stay in the hotel for dinner and im glad I did as the menu had an array of wonderful seasonal produce and so my asparagus followed by fresh sea bream went down a treat along with different wines to compliment each course which the waiters knowledge of was infallible. Altogether I had a lovely time staying at the Cadogan hotel and will definitly stay there again soon, as they proved those wrong who say you cant have style and service at your fingertips....."
23,602,"Jun 2 2009 	Wonderful Hotel Great Staff and Location	This Hotel is in an upscale neighborhood, a few blocks from the underground, and walking distance to many good restaurants. The Hotel's restaurant is also very good for dinner. The staff, in particular, Ritchie and Marco (front desk), Ryan, Richard and Renato (food and beverage) were friendly, helpful, professional and a pleasure to meet. Our room was comfortable and clean. We loved the location of the Hotel and the excellent service from the Staff. My only complaint would be the breakfast was overpriced. There are several good places a couple of blocks away at Sloan Square."
24,602,"May 29 2009 	Charming and Elegant Hotel in a Ritzy Neighborhood	This hotel is situated in Chelsea, a neighborhood with an upscale feel to it. It is relatively convenient to public transportation, although when the Circle and District lines went out of service on the day we planned for the Tower of London, we scrambled to get on a bus that took over an hour to go across town.The staff was pleasant at this hotel and the concierge Ritchie gave us the perfect recommendation for a nearby pub - it was exactly what we had in mind and had an incredible shepherd's pie. The night manager was an amiable gentleman, albeit a bit flustered. He misinformed us that the walk to Victoria Station would take at least 45 minutes, when in reality, it took under 15.This is a historic hotel that has been updated nicely and has all the modern conveniences one would expect. The room had a sleek and classic look, tastefully furnished. We had been upgraded to a deluxe room and I'm not sure exactly what that meant, but we had a separate entrance hall/dressing room where the minisafe and closet were situated.We had a pleasant stay at The Cadogan - it is what you would expect for the rate, which was ~240 pounds per night."
25,602,May 23 2009 	Always a fantastic stay. Wonderful staff and service	I would like to recommend this hotel to everyone. I have been staying here for over 20 years and the staff and hotel is wonderful. I always recommend people I know from Texas and around the U.S. to stay at this hotel. Special mention to the following people:Richie Long- Wonderful and cheerful individual that has been a good friend for over 15 years. This individual makes the &quot;Cadogon Hotel a home away from home&quot;. Always helps new people to the hotel and the &quot;Old Timers&quot; like me. The hotel is lucky to have him. He is the Concierge and always knows where to go about town.Joe- Has been at the Cadogan for many years and their Concierge. He gives me the directions and help that I always need away from home. A real English Gentleman and fun to know. My Bar Keepers- Special thanks to Renado and John who are incredible. Both give the customers great service and a different taste to the English Hospitality. John is a perfect &quot;English Gentleman&quot; and Renado is from Brazil who give you a different perspective of the world. At the Cadogan the bar is wonderful and these two gentleman are really interesting to listen to. Great service.A very good experience at this hotel.
26,602,"May 20 2009 	A very poorly managed hotel shame..service and facilities appalling..	Hardly a Leading Hotel..whoever operates this once iconic establishment should be ashamed. This is a very poor example of the best in hospitality..breakfast simply dreadful and service embarassingly slow and haphazard..sugar bowl filthy, coffee cold,orange juice.awful..I could go on and on...back to the drawing board chaps. There is no shortcut to success, suggest you recruit wisely, train incessantly ..obviously GM not an Hotelier."
27,602,"May 14 2009 	AMAZING!!!	As a frequent traveler throughout Europe i have been fortunate enough to stay in some of the best hotels. The Cadogan was by far one of the best experiences to date. The service was excellent. The manager, Tim, went above and beyond. The room was elegant and spotless. Room service at 3am FANTASTIC. I give this a 5 star rating and would reccomend this hotel to anyone traveling to London!!!"
28,602,"Apr 24 2009 	Exceptional in every way.	We stayed here along with 9 other couples in connection with the opening of a play in London that I wrote. One cannot overstate the excellence of the hotel, its gracious staff, its comfortable and well appointed rooms. They could not do enough for us. They were cheerful, helpful, and the intimate but elegant atmosphere of the hotel set it apart."
29,602,"Apr 21 2009 	The best way to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.	This is one of the most luxurious hotels we have had the pleasure to visit.The level of service was outstanding, all our needs were met and exceeded.We enjoyed probably the best meal we have ever had in the hotel's restaurant. I would definitely recommend a romantic dinner there.Thanks for making our special day so much more memorable and enjoyable."
30,602,"Mar 31 2009 	We would give the Service 6 out of 5 if we could!	We have just returned from a weekend in London to celebrate my Mum's birthday. The Cadogan Hotel, and particularly Richard on the front desk, was instrumental in making the weekend a huge success. The hotel is in a lovely area, and we were all pleased with our rooms, they were spacious, elegant and the bed was so comfortable I had the best night's sleep I'd had in ages. We were delighted that Mum was given an upgrade, it made her feel really special. We were extremely well looked after at all times with great attention to detail - when hearing that we were going to the theatre to see Blood Brothers, Richard presented Mum with a box of tissues, warning that it was a tearjerker. We ate in the restaurant in the evening, and the meal was superb, made even more enjoyable by the excellent service, particularly that of Eba our waitress, who was everything that a waitress should be - friendly, attentive, courteous, knowledgable about the food and patient. We also really enjoyed the opportunity to take a stroll in the private garden.We would recommend this hotel to anyone (though make sure Richard isn't on holiday before you book - it wouldn't be the same without him!).Minor comments, it was odd that there wasn't a mirror in our bedroom, and we did miss not having tea and coffee making facilities."
31,602,"Mar 30 2009 	Exceptional Hotel	Stayed overnight during May 2008.Very large room with superb furnishings also had with two bathrooms and two balconies so no complaints there !Staff friendly, helpful and attentive. Food first rate. This is one of those rare hotels which captures a golden era but includes all contemporary requirements. Quite expensive but worth the money &amp; very well located for Sloane Sq and Knightsbridge.Ask for the key to the main square's gardens - a charming haven in the midst of London's bustle."
32,602,"Mar 29 2009 	this hotel does not live up to its rating	The service was excellent and very helpful. Very disappointed with our room, very small and pokey. Was surprised not having the option of a bath and shower, just a shower. I had to ask for a mirror to be sent to the room as there werent any at all in the bedroom, how on earth you could dry your hair without a mirror was ridiculous.We have been in far better 3 star hotels with far better facilities. In saying that it was very clean and towels changed every day and the resturant was superb. The food was second to none. Good location for Harrods and Harvey Nichs with good access to the underground. Overall It was ok, We paid 99 per night for the room as there was an offer on. If we were to pay the full price of 200 a night, we would be far from happy"
33,602,Mar 23 2009 	A hotel to be in when you need help	The Cadogan is a really marvellous hotel for one main reason - the staff. They are always there to help and advise and at times of crisis (which we experienced) the whole staff stepped up to the mark and made us more comfortable and confident.The hotel is very grand and typically English and the rooms are well laid out and spacious with modern bathrooms and good bed linen. The reception area was glorious with yellow daffodils and you are immediately welcomed by the reception staff.Well done everyoneElizabeth
34,602,"Mar 21 2009 	Good - if you get a special deal	I'm only getting around to writing up reviews of our recent trip to London (January 2009). We stayed at the Cadogan having gotten a special offer in their 'Sale' - 99 sterling per night (room only). Location is perfect for the Knightsbridge/Chelsea area and just off Sloan Street and around the corner from Harrods. Check-in was efficient if not quite brusk - but that didn't matter much to us as we only intended to use it for sleep. Our room was allocated in the eaves of the building overlooking a side street. Beautifully appointed and decorated well. However on closer inspection there was a complete film of dust on the television unit (which wasn't cleaned off during our stay). Shower only in our room which suited us just fine. We didn't use the toiletries as it appeared the small bottles had been 'refilled' with liquids and the tops not cleaned off properly and looked quite grubby. We went out and bought our own. Slightly disappointed as this hotel is affiliated with the 'the leading small Hotels in the World'. My husband got extremely ill on our second night (chickenpox as we later found out!) and we had to cut our stay short and return home. Tried to access the business centre to book a flight home to be told by another guest to come back in 30 minutes as he was busy!! The hotel charged us for our third night even though we were back in Ireland and hubbie tucked up in our own bed. At the time it didn't really matter as he was so ill I would have spent my last penny on getting him home.Overall, this hotel is situated in a perfect area and I would consider staying here again (if I got a good deal) but wouldn't have been best pleased if we had paid full prices for the pleasure of staying there."
35,602,"Mar 17 2009 	Great location in Knightsbridge	We stayed at The Cadogan for two nights thanks to a great deal on Priceline, and thought it was terrific. While the hotel itself has a sort of faded elegance (which my wife loves), the rooms have been updated, with good bathrooms, (small) flatscreen TV, free high-speed internet, etc. And for the price we paid, having a Knightsbridge/Belgravia address was something. We felt quite posh wandering around all the multimillion dollar properties.Only drawback was our room faced the street and it was a bit noisy. Oh, and they wanted a 40 quid supplement for the use of a baby crib, which was fairly astounding. We had planned on having our baby sleep in the bed with us anyway, but out of the 5 hotels we stayed in during this trip, The Cadogan was the only one with a surcharge, and a rather expensive one at that."
36,602,Mar 9 2009 	Everything was lovely	This is a fabulous hotel. The staff are really lovely. The lady who looked after us at breakfast was wonderful. The whole hotel is elegant and charming. We loved it.
37,602,"Mar 9 2009 	Lots of Problems	Stayed in the Cadogen in March for 4 nights. Hotel is in a nice location and looks pleasant from the outside. However, after checking in the problems began, the room we were allocated was on the main road even though had requested room as back if possible and was very noisy. Asked for room at back and they said they had one for the following night which I was happy enough with. This was a big mistake, we were being punished for moving rooms as the new room on the 4th floor was tiny and had a 4foot bed for 2 people so we were hanging out of the bed it was so small. I had asked for wireless access on arrival which worked in the first room but this room was so far up that there was no signal so not good if you have work to do. Having said this, the small room was quieter so we were willing to sqeeze into the tiny bed. The final straw was on our last night when there was a party in an apartment near the back of the hotel which played music until 5 am which blared into the room. We contacted reception and they apologised but said there were no other rooms so there was nothing they could do but they would let manager know. After very little sleep, we checked out next day at the end of our 4 nights. I mentioned the problem the night before which she knew about but they offered us nothing for the sleepless night and proceeded to charge us the full whack. I stayed at a premier inn for the last year in London and the standard was much higher than this hotel. At least you got a bed that you could fit into. The drawing room is nice but considering you have to pay 4.75 plus service to have a cup of tea as there are no tea making facilites in the rooms, it can mount up. If the manager had at least offered us some sort of apology and perhaps something off the bill for the final night, we would've felt less aggrieved but it was handled badly. I don't think I will be returning to this hotel and it's definitely not a 5 star. My advice is to stay at the premier inn."
38,602,"Mar 1 2009 	Great hotel in great neighborhood with great staff.	Arrived at 8:40 after overnight flight and Rait at front desk had us in a room by the time we returned from breakfast at 10, even though the hotel was sold out the night before. Richie, the Concierge, began dispensing outstanding advice immediately with a local eatery for breakfast the first morning. His advice on dining options, places to see and how and when to get to where we wanted to go, was a key element in our superior 5 Day Holiday.  The hotel was well appointed and the room was nicely furnished clean and comfortable.Would highly recommend and definitely return to The Cadogan."
39,602,Feb 26 2009 	Like the central location and the amability of the staff	We like everything of the Cadogan Hotel and the proof is that we've been faithful and regular guests of the Cadogan since we left London in 1987. That's a long time!
40,602,Feb 22 2009 	Our visit to Cadogan in was a pleasant surprise	Our visit to Cadogan in Knightsbridge was a pleasant surprise . The location of Hotel is superb in the heart of Knightsbridge cloase all the major shopping and attractions just of Sloane Avenue. Its a quaint town house hotel with all the facility and ambiance of a modern boutique hotel. We had a very smooth checking and all the staff where friendly and helpful. The rooms are amazing and very specious and very tactfully decorated . The beds where very comfortable and hotel is very quiet so you sleep well.  The corridors and the bar area could do with a bit of revamping as they felt a bit tired. On our last night we had cocktails in the bar and romantic dinner in Langtrys restaurant and we took advantage of the 3 courses and unlimited wine for 30 and it was outstanding value . The staff was attentive without being overly fussy and the food was good - portions a bit smale but wiht 3 courses and all wine it was just perfect. I would definalty recomend this hotel and would love to go back again a very comfertable and romantic experiance
41,602,"Feb 21 2009 	Five stars Hotel- Five stars memories!	My family and I stayed at the Cadogan Hotel in the beginning of February for a weekend break away from home. We wanted to spend some quality time together and do a bit of shopping and sightseeing.We had a great experience from the day we arrived till the day we had to leave. It was our first visit and the first thing we noticed was the friendly staff. They made us feel very welcome and accomodated our needs as a family. The suite we booked was beautifully furnished in modern english style and &quot;calming&quot; colors, The atmosphere in the bar and lounge area was cozy and intimate and if it was not because I was there on a family holiday, I could have stayed in the lounge for hours snuggling down in the comfortable chairs enjoying my coffee and a good book. One afternoon we decided to have afternoon tea in the lounge and it was absolutely delicious, especially the scones- the best I have ever tasted. Again I would like to point out the staff. They were really helpful when we needed advise where to go with our children and how to get there.The location of the Hotel is great because it is situated in the heart of London, walking distance to Harrods and Harvey Nicols and close to Knightsbridge underground station, from where it was easy for us to reach our destinations.We would definately come back, maybe for a romantic weekend break without the children:-)"
42,602,"Feb 20 2009 	Truly great location with history friendly staff and art	I followed my wife on a business trip to London, as I had not been there for a number of years.She booked the Cadogan through her company, as it was close to the places she had to work from, and she had a good price with them.It was realy good to be able to visit some museus I had not seen in other visits. For me this hotel was a discovery becouse I believed it was just an old building in Knightsbridge. The location is just perfect, for shopping and for tourism. You are closed to everything important in London and can walk everywhere. I discovered about Oscar Wilde, who was arrested there. It was quite an emotion for me. What I like about this hotel was the art exibitions they have, it creates a sense of calm, and you feel in a place different from all the modern and big hotels you stay during your trips. The staff was really good and friendly, very down to earth. In some hotels you feel you are not welcome, here it was the opposite. Everybody was talking to us. Particularly Ritchi, the concierge, was very friendly and tryed to speak words in Spanish. I also tryed the restaurant, becouse my wife did not want to go out one evening. The food was really good. I can say that becouse I live in Madrid and eat good food every day. The restaurant was british modern and I realy loved it. The bedroom was a little small, even though it was looking new and very clean. I will recomend this hotel to all of my friends who want to go to London.Xavi Godoy"
43,602,"Feb 19 2009 	Two star dressed as a three and pretending to be a five star	The employees were polite and attentive. That is were the compliments end. The Cadogan is resting on older glory and is in essence an overpriced hostel. Starting with the hallway carpets on our floor which were aged and dirty. The hallway design was less boutique and more 1950's apartment-tight space with squeaky floorboards. Even the elevator is small and cramped, they may have added modern lights, but for a hotel of that size, that elevator was an atrocity.Moving on to the room: The room was extremely cramped for one person let alone two people. There was barely any room to swing the proverbial cat. There are hostel rooms larger than this. If two rooms were joined together it would be closer to a regular size hotel room.The mattress-was lumpy and aged and the pillows were quite flat. The bathroom which had such five star luxuries as Ikea water glasses and soap dishes, was the only thing that could possibly make The Cadogan rise from it's two star ranks to two point five stars. It had many of the amenities you would expect in a hotel bathroom. The only problem is that it was quite small and from an architectural viewpoint the walls were horribly constructed with sharp edges. My sister injured herself against such edge as she went into the shower.The Cadogan is an embarrassment to true five star hotels. This is a two star hostel barely dressed as a three star yet parading around as a five star. Charging five-star rates does not make a hotel a five star. Nor does being located in Knightsbridge or being apart of a select group of chain hotels does not give a hotel an automatic five star rating. This hotel must be placed in it's proper category as a 2 star hotel. Placing it in a five-star hotel is an outright lie and injustice to true five star hotels."
44,602,"Feb 16 2009 	loved it	stayed wit the family for 3 days, we had 3 rooms booked, at arrival the reception team were so welcoming and very helpful, the afternoon tea was a tiptop experience which we all had to try the best scones we ever had, and the service was just first class.our rooms were a bit small but had everything a family would require and housekeeping were just on top of everything.all in all i would say it was a great stay"
45,602,Feb 15 2009 	Fantastic hotel	Went there for a weekend break and absolutely loved it.The rooms were spacious and had a very traditional feel to them.The staff was very helpful and the food at the restaurant was amazing.The location is excellant with all all the shopping around .Overall a fabulous experience and we would definately stay there again.
46,602,"Feb 2 2009 	Not the 5 star experience one normally expects	I stayed here with my husband for 2 nights . We were in London on a mixed trip of business and pleasure. We booked the hotel on line and had no problem with the booking despite a late arrival. The hotel location is great for knightsbridge, located half way down Sloane St. and equidistant from Knightsbridge or Sloane Square tube station ( 5 min walk). The hotel is Edwardian in style. The elevator in the lobby is the old type open lift with sliding gate. It is quite small allowing 3 people in at one time. Our room was on the third floor right beside the lift and we certainly could hear noise from the lift at night. The hotel was not very busy at the time of our stay, so it wasn't a major problem. The room itself was small with a small double bed (5ft bed). There were no tea/ coffee making facilities in the room , but there was a minibar if you like that kind of thing. The Lilly Langtry connection is flogged a lot at the hotel. Our bedroom had three A4 size photos of her on the wall, the restaurant is called Langtrys etc etc. They don't let you escape the history of the building! There was a TV with only a few channels in english, but it was a clear picture quality and adequate. We had very little time to watch TV with so much to do in the area. The bathroom in our room was surprisingly large, with full size bath tub and a shower unit. The water pressure is woeful, the worst I have come across in a hotel for a very long time. We felt we had to dance around the shower to get wet! The room in general was clean and warm with a turn down service at night. Our room faced onto Sloane Street and there was some city noise but nothing that would keep us awake at night. We didn't eat at the hotel. There are lots of restaurants in the area and we chose to eat out instead. This is not your standard corporate 5 star hotel. It is more boutique in nature, olde worlde, and I would have to say that our room was more like 3+ star standard rather than 5.The staff were all efficient and courteous with good english. We had no problems in that regard. We paid $150 for the room per night not including breakfast. At the time in the location it was the best value and on leaving the hotel we both felt we had good value for the money in that location."
47,602,"Jan 26 2009	Will never go back!	I think this hotel is really, really overrated. The location is great, but the hotel is lacking somewhat. The room we were allocated was opposite the very loud banging gate of the lift therefore we asked to be moved to another room. The lady on reception gave the impression that I'd perhaps asked for her kidney, and when I tried to explain that being 5 months pregnant I'm finding it difficult to sleep without a banging lift and passing traffic noise, she simply stated that it would be very difficult to move us. We were finally allocated another room, which to be honest was awful... if you get room 320 ask to be moved. The room is tiny as it's on a corner and the bathroom is so pokey I felt claustrophobic! There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and a cup of tea from room service is 5.00 plus the obligatory 12.5% charge... saying that, a full english in bed is 24.50 each, plus 5 room supplement plus 12.5% discretionary charge!! (sorry, I think this is hilarious!!)To top it all off we came back from the ridiculous Langtry restaurant (table of 8 people set up in the middle of the room were so loud we could barely have a conversation, waitress struggles to be understood due to poor english, food was of miniscule proportions) to find that there is an air conditioning unit outside which hummed all night...I was looking forward to checking out so I could tell the staff my thoughts on the place, but the gentleman on reception couldn't have been less interested. We weren't asked if we'd had a nice stay, or thanked. I felt grateful to have received eye contact!I got the impression the staff felt they were much better than us, which I think is disgraceful. Far from the romantic break we had planned, I couldn't wait to leave this hotel. Reception staff could do with a lesson in customer service and whoever thought charging nearly a tenner for a hot chocolate is reasonable needs a reality check.Would I be back? Never."
48,602,"Jan 24 2009 	not 5 star	Stayed at the Cadogan for 3 nights though the location is great for sightseeing in London the rooms and service are certainly no where near 5 star max 3 star. The room was absolutely tiny, there was only double glazing on one window it had obviously fallen off the other window and not replaced making the room noisey all night. Light in wardrope was broken and flicked on and off. Turn down service only happened 2 of the 3 nights. the t.v. was so fuzzy I couldn't watch it and the freeview didn't work. No tea or coffee making facilities in room. Staff seemed disinterested didn't ask if everything was ok on check out, while I was checking out staff moved onto next customer with out indicating wheither he was finished with me or saying thank you or goodbye. Got the impression staff thought they were better then me the paying guest. Not worth the price won't be staying here again. I will stay in the Wyndham grand which was fantastic when I stayed in November '08."
49,602,"Jan 22 2009	Best location possible with professional and friendy staff	The hotel's location is unbeatable for its proximity to London's most well known boroughs Kensington and Chelsea and Fulham. Just a couple minutes' walk from Harvey Nichols and Harrods on one side (with Knightsbidge tube station a stone throw away) and Sloane square and King's road on the other (with Sloane Square tube station a 5 minutes walk from the hotel), The Cadogan hotel has the best location possible for the best shopping in London. Staff was extremely welcoming making us feel at home, but with all the comforts of a Leading Small Hotel of the World. A special mention must go to the hotel's barman: unimpeachable and a pleasure to be served by him. Being a frequent visitor of London, I will definitely come back to The Cadogan and I sincerely reccomend it to anyone who would like to have a priviedged location when visiting the city be it for work or leisure."
50,602,"Jan 21 2009	Great Location tip-top service	Great Location equidistant from Knigtsbridge and Sloan Square tube stops(&lt;5min walk each) , making access to London quite easy.Service was great. Very prompt, courteous, and pleasant.Rooms were average but mine (415) had a recently remodeled modern bath.Our window opened to Sloane street below, but I was able to sleep with the window cracked without too much bother of noise.At a priceline bid of only $USD 155/night I considered this a GREAT value.Would certainly stay again."
51,602,"Jan 3 2009 	Great Location	We stayed 3 nights at the Cadogan. A great location- within easy walking distance of Knightsbridge and Sloane Sq. tube stations, and there's a bus that is right on Sloane st- I think it's actually one that somebody commented is just like a tour bus for a lot less GBP- by the way it is great to ride the double deckers. The hotel is a boutique sized hotel and everything is just that size- boutique size. The lobby, the elevator, the room, the gym (3 machines)- they were all incredibly small a 3 day stay for us was probably the max. (but I suppose it was a winter trip and we were all bundled up and quite rotund.) We did not find the staff too helpful, but on the other hand we didn't ask for much either. The best thing was that they had a basket of clementine oranges at the front desk, lovely. We were awoken one night to a mouse on our luggage (and no food in the luggage either) and were offered a particularly lame excuse by the desk clerk and no recompense-take 1* away. It's not nice to know there's vermin in your room. The bath was the swankiest part of the hotel and ours was large to boot, a luxury one done up in tasteful marble with nice fixtures (though I didn't care for the no water pressure gravity drop down shower head.) There was an adequate flat screen TV. We had a room facing Sloan St. (on 4) which we thought may be noisy from traffic but because of winter the windows were shut (and they are sort of jerry rigged double glazed) but the most noise was from the lift which was right outside our door- it's an old style lift with a manual outer gate and just big enough for 3- fortunately the hotel is upscale and seemingly goes to be early. We paid 99 GBP through Priceline, and noticed they are offering that special directly. They did offer us a larger room for an extra 20GBP per night after night 1 which was completely sold out. I didn't see it a a 5 star hotel which Priceline bills it at, 3.5-4, I don't know how it is part of the Leading Hotels of the World affiliation. But the location is fantastic just off Knightsbridge, and Sloane Sq. enough and right across from a lovely looking park."
52,602,"Dec 18 2008 	More than Oscar Wilde	Hi,I went to spent some days in London for shows and I did want to know by myself the famour Oscar Wilde's hotel. I tought it was the perfect place for my plans of a few days for west end plays: Oscar Wilde bedroom for Oscar Wilde theaterland.And what I found was much more than this. I planned my trip with time enought to have for me that room. And it's great and really charmy. Full of history. But that beautiful hotel is MUCH more than this. It's worm and you feel like at home. It's a great hotel with great people inside. And the lovely edwardan building can not be better.Just perfect.Nacho. Madrid. Spain"
53,602,"Dec 2 2008	Great service beyond our expectations!	I stayed at the Cadogan a few years ago on business and it was nice to come back with the family this time on a short vacation. The location is central (Knightsbridge) and close to public transport as well as good shopping and restaurants in London. The staff and management of the Cadogan were very helpful and friendly (unlike the perception that most English are stuffy). We had to unexpectedly extend our stay for a few days in London due to the chaos in the Bangkok Airport &amp; our flight back to Asia was abruptly cancelled. Despite full bookings at the Cadogan, hotel manager Adi was able to arrange for us to stay on while keeping everybody concerned happy. We really appreciated his efforts since we didn't have to have to hassle with moving out to another hotel &amp; all. As we waited for our flight to be confirmed, Ritchie and Joe at the Concierge kept us busy with suggestions for sightseeing and restaurants. Ritchie, in particular, kept us entertained with anecdotes and jokes about his dear Mom! Finally, front desk manager Rait was very helpful and most efficient, keeping us constantly updated on the status of our rooms. This is one of the most welcoming &amp; accomodating hotel staff we have encountered in London or in Europe."
54,602,Nov 22 2008 	excellent treat !!!	A treat in hospitality ! I would recommend The Cadogan not only for its superb location {middle of Sloan Street) around the corner from Harrods but especially for the special touch the staff gives to make your stay very comfortable and welcoming. The ambience is relaxed though with true English cosy elegance. With its history it brings you back in time but with some nice modern live touches... have some tapas at the bar {recommended} My address to stay for a London shopping visit !!!
55,602,Nov 20 2008 	Cadogan: Perfect Location with Art	I booked through their web site as their rates were really good. Was uncertain of the product when making the reservation. I was pleasantly surprised as I found the hotel really British. The location was also just what I was looking for. The service was impeccable and the staff really pleasant. The breakfast experience was enjoyable in this restaurant which looks like a private home. The bedroom was of a good size and very clean. The technical offer in the room was average. What really impressed me though was the art exhibition they had and they seem to change regularly. I felt like in an art gallery. The Concierge Joe is old school and knows his job. I will definitely get back there.
56,602,Jul 2 2008	Great service but could use a little something	The Cadogan was a wonderful hotel but could have a few improvements.The service was perfect. The staff was courteous and helpful. The atmosphere traditional and classy in the common areas. Afternoon tea was perfect.The improvements were needed in the room they gave us. We requested a deluxe double and were put in a superior double which was the lesser of a room. The carpet was dingy and stained and there was a leak in the corner of the room by the closet. (This stained some clothing that was there before the discovery of the leak.) The television was very limited on choices of channels and the shelving in the bathroom was directly over the toilet. (not good when something drops) The gym was very tiny and limited. I will say that the staff was excellent though.
57,602,"Jun 3 2008 	Lovely Cadogan	I was referred by friends of friends to try the Cadogan.From the first moment I got into the hotel, I knew it was going to be my place. Very traditional and discreet. The staff at the reception were very professional and very friendly. I really felt welcome. The room was new and very clean. Not many TV channells though. I will certainly recommend this hotel to all of my friends, who like me travel on business.Grazie Cadogan.Silvio Bonetti - Milan"
58,602,"Jun 2 2008 	Great Service and Good Product in a Great Location	I had read an article on the NY Times and was intrigued by the history of this property. Oscar Wilde arrested there and Lllie Langtry used to live there. Decided to give it a try on my next trip to London.I loved every minute of it. The location could not be better, in Knightsbridge, near Harrods and on Sloane Street. The staff was friendly and very attentive. Always had the right word, at the right time. I did love my stay with them. The rooms were new and very clean. They had just had a refurbishment the Housekeeper said to me. I normally like more contemporary hotels, this is very British and very classic in style. I did not mind that. They were also having some art exhibitions, which I though was something different for an hotel. Loved the British contemporary food experience, which I thought was something worth a try. Did not know how good the British cuisine could be.I will definitely be back.George WilsonChicagoIllinois"
59,602,"May 27 2008 	Never Again - Unless you like not being able to sleep	I was shown to my room by a staff member who said it was her favorite room in the hotel - she must be an insomniac because the street noise made it impossible to get any sleep. The hotel is located at the intersection of two major streets and so the street noise goes on all night long. I live in New York City and so know there are things you can do to block out the street noise but this hotel has done of those things. I won't even bother to mention that a window, window shade, light and air conditioner in my room were all not working. Management was unreceptive to any discussion of a credit for my sleepless nights or for all the things that were not working in my room."
60,602,"Apr 12 2008 	Classical and Luxery in Knightsbridge	After touring many hotels in London the Cadogan was by FAR our group's number one choice. Its superb location in Knightsbridge off Sloane Street can't be beat. All of London's sights are are quickly and easily accessible from this location by Underground.Upon entering the lobby, one steps back in time as the decor is very traditional yet classical and is complimented well with pieces of classical art. Close attention to intricate details can be seen in all areas - from the tiles in the public areas to the light fixtures. The hotel has quite an interesting history - combined with the elegant decor and excellent service, this hotel is a great choice for discerning travellers (bear in mind London prices!)The rooms on the upper floors are more traditional and elegant in decor - as I understood these are the refurbished rooms. I recommend requesting one of these rooms as the rooms on the lower floors are more contemporary and lack the elegant decor and historical feel of the rooms on the upper floors. For the discerning traveller who prefers properties which reflect the city that they are in will find this hotel a perfect choice. Its elegance and excellent service also make it an exceptional choice for honeymoon couples."
61,602,"Feb 27 2008 	Need management change	Surprised by our stay in this lovely hotel, which used to be Lilly Langtry's house. The day manager is difficult. We were in a very small room in which nothing worked (including the shower television and telephone) and it took him three days to change our room. We were not able to change hotels as we had sadly booked on Expedia (which we have learned is not a good way to go-- you are usually stuck with the least desirable room, since the hotel knows you can't get out of your booking).The night manager was wonderful, and made up for our grouchiness-- he upgraded us to a lovely room with breakfast included. The day manager however and even GM were not too courteous from that moment on, when they discovered that the night manager had given us more than the price we were paying , and this made us uncomfortable when we would see them walking around--(hotel is quite small). All this made my husband say he wouldn't go back. It's too bad, as I have fond memories of having had lovely teas there (they have very nice scones.)"
62,602,"Nov 27 2007 	Brilliant staff!	We stayed here in October, the service was far more personal than larger establishments , Alasdar was a gem! Definately would stay again next time we are in London, it was like a home from home."
63,602,Aug 22 2007 	Great Hotel	Stayed in many hotels in London over the past couple of years and this is by far one of the best. Staff were friendly and rooms were clean. The hotel has recently been refurbished and the rooms look great. The food was great value for money and the location can not be beaten. Harrods is a stones throw away and the fact that its a small boutique hotel means it feels more like home then a hotel.
64,602,Jul 18 2007	Tiny Room Awful Service	Stayed one night at Cadogan in June. Paid 300 pounds for a room that was 125 sq ft and the service was awful to boot! I expected more from the hotel.
65,602,"Jul 11 2007 	Disappointing	Originally booked to stay in a sister hotel of The Cadogan but due to a problem there with overbooking for one night of our three night stay, we were transferred to The Cadogan for one night. A taxi was arranged for us and we arrived at the hotel to be met by bored looking, grumpy, middle aged male staff. We were not shown to our room nor were we given any explanation of the hotel's amenities or facilities, which of course we were not familiar with as we had not booked to stay here! The corridors are dark, small and the carpets are dirty. The rooms are bright, nicely furnished and very comfortable. The bathrooms are tiny, cramped and the tiles in the bath are FILTHY. The scum and limescale has built up due to lack of cleaning at over head levels. A paper ordered the night before was not delivered. As we had to wait until after midday to go back to our original hotel, we checked out, settled our bill, had some breakfast and then proceeded to go back to their sister hotel. Even though a taxi had been arranged for us the day before and we were promised that another would be arranged to bring us back, the concierge were apparently unable to arrange a taxi and we had to hail one from the street! So most of our day was spent getting back to our original hotel and no acknowledgement or apology was provided. For the price charged and the hype surrounding this 'exlcusive' hotel - it ain't all that!!!"
66,602,"Jul 2 2007 	it never stopped raining	The reception staff are first class,hotel just being refurbished,sack the designer,too much battleship grey,food and drink really overpriced and not up to the standard one would expect.Room clean television not working, shower,worth seeing,just to see what you can squeeze into such a tiny space.Close Harrods .On the plus side the reception staff are really proffessional.Far too expensive.j.cooke"
67,602,"Mar 9 2007	Great Staff.	Myself and my wife stayed here for three nights last Feburary. From the moment we stepped into the hotel, we knew it was something special. We were met by Richie form Concierge. we cant give enough praise about this guy, From the moment we arrived to the moment we left he sorted everything out for us. Dinner Reservations ( all Spot On ), theatre tickets ( When there was none to be Found ). He seemed genuinly interestered in our stay. A rare thing these days in Hotels.Our Room was nice and very spacious overlooking the Park. Harodds was only around the corner, so location was super too.Breakfast was good with a lot of choice and the cooked breakfast was fresh and hot.Many thanks to the night porters who welcomed us home each night after dinner. Nothing was to much trouble for them.We will defenitly be back. the perfect place for a weekend break. A little pricey, but the location is worth it. I believe the hotel is located very near where Jose mourinho lives. We did not see him this time though !"
68,602,Mar 1 2007 	Not what it was...	I used to stay at The Cadogan very regularly a few years ago. I had to go to London in December and decided to stay there again. Unfortunately I didn't know the hotel had changed so much and all the atmosphere was gone. I'll try something different next time.
69,602,"Feb 26 2007 	Can't Keep the Family Away!	I have stayed in the Cadogan several times, but this was the first time with the family of 3 young children. We had stayed in Windsor the night before in an Awful hotel and on a whim I decided to surprise the family and book us in here. From the moment we met the Concierge on arrival to the next evening when he got us a taxi, the whole stay was absolutely fantastic. The rooms [beside each other]] were spacious and comfortable. The breakfasts were expansive and appealed to 5 different tastes. The service was wonderful. It is pricey, but worth every penny/cent/dime for a special occasion!"
70,602,"Jan 20 2007 	The best concierge in London	We stayed a full week end in the hotel and it was great. The hotel is located in Knightsbridge which is an up market part of London.It was close to the main shopping districts and the west end.Our room was big and comfortable and the room service and full english breakfast was excellent. The staff of the hotel were supberb, friendly welcoming and very proffesional. We must give a special mention to the conceigre Richie, he is the main of the attraction of the hotel. Nothing is a problem for this guy and if you want anything in london this is the man who will get it for you. He couldn't do enough for us and he almost made us feel like family."
71,602,"Dec 17 2006	Stuffy but good	I like the Codogan almost despite myself. It is in a good location, not great for kids but reasonably near the park and the shops are all the expensive ones only but the its just a little bit ... stuffy . they still serve afternoon tea wearing tuxedos . We moved in here as we hated the Myhotel so much so in those cirumstances it was pleasant but I wont go back there"
72,602,"Dec 4 2006 	A romantic weekend spoilt	My wife and I have a 1 year old baby. Both Grandparents live in Dublin while we live in London. We flew my Mother over to look after the baby while we went for a night away. We booked the hotel through a web agency specifically so that we were close to a Sloane Square restaurant. We phoned the hotel direct as well just to check availability and the safety of using one of their booking agency partners - both were positive answers.We arrived at 3pm nice and early. There was an apparent problem with the booking. They had booked a single room - even though they had the booking under MR &amp; MRS! It took them 1/2 an hour to tell us this and that we were being shifted to another hotel - a 1/2 hour taxi journey away. I told them we had specifically booked this hotel for the location, but they didn't seem to care.By the time we got to our room in our 'tourist' hotel in the other end of town it was 5pm. The Cadogan hotel didn't offer a drink while waiting - I had to ask was the drink free for the inconvenience. We had to get a 1/2 hour cab journey back to our restaurant and another 1/2 hour home.We live 45 mins door to door from the hotel, so excluding this our romantic night out consisted of 3 hours of time wasted."
73,602,"Nov 20 2006 	Waste of a weekend time and money	I wouldn't recommend the Cadogan as a place to stay in London. The only positive thing I can say about it is that the location is terrific. I checked into the hotel on Friday 17th November (for a two night stay), dropped to the door by a driver who had picked me up at Heathrow. The staff looked bored and were anything but friendly. The receptionist checked me in and accompanied me to my room, which was on the fourth floor. My initial reaction was that the room was tiny. Ok - standard double rooms in a City such as London can be small - but this took this biscuit.The decor too was very tatty and dated. I commented to the receptionist that it was very warm... her answer was to open the window. Note windows in hotels only open a few centimetres, for safety reasons. My partner met me at the hotel an hour or so later and he too instantly commented on how hot the room was. We could see that this was a recurring problem as the room had a built in airconditioning unit (which only blew out hot air), a stand alone fan and fan in the ceiling. My boyfriend told me that as it was an old building there were probably pipes in the walls increasing the heat, coupled with the fact that we were on the top floor. We went out for dinner that evening and came back to the room (we had left all fans on), but were knocked out by the heat. We called reception and asked if it would be possible to be moved, but they had no other rooms. The concierge however came up to the room with an air conditioning unit for us. This quickly solved the problem, but it was unbelieveably noisy!! The next morning we got up for breakfast, which was ok - the service was appauling - we had to ask for everything twice and the food was cold. The continental buffet was very average. After breakfast we asked if there was a possibility of changing rooms and thankfully they were able to accomodate us. We were moved to room 106 which was a far more spacious room with working air conditioning. The bed too was far superior. My only compalint with this room would be that we could hear very loud music and shouting from next door, into the early hours of the morning. In a nutshell, I would never return to this hotel - it is a complete let down and I was really surprised to read such good reviews about it here!!! Maybe I just had a bad experience, but I find that really hard to believe...."
74,602,"Oct 3 2006 	Great Small Hotel	Stayed at the Cadogan for 4 nights in September. Nice small hotel in great location near Hyde Park, Harrods and other upscale shopping on Sloane St. Service was excellent thanks to Richie! Concierge also gave us 2 good restaurant recommendations. London is EXPENSIVE and at USD$300+ a night the Cadogan is actually a value."
75,602,"Jul 24 2006	The cadogan	cadogan- checkin was simple and easy, our room was quite comfortable and nicely decorated. it was a nice size, and the bathroom was nice as well. the problem were the hallways that lead you to your room. With large luggage, it was almost impossible to to get to the room through those hallways. It would also have been better if they were lighted better. There is no pool, and I didnt see a gym so it was a little disappointing. The restaurant was good for breakfast but isnt worth going to in the evening. Afternoon tea was served in the evening and was delicious. The front desk staff and restaurant staff were extremely curtious, helpful, and friendly. The conceriege helped us quite a lot as well. The room service &quot;staff&quot; were unpleasant-especially when you take advantage of the fact that the hotel has 24-hour room service : ) the location of this hotel was wonderful-right a few steps away from the best and most expensive shopping in london as well as Harrod's. All in all, The cadogan was a god hotel with some flaws, but they can easily be overlooked."
76,602,"Feb 7 2006	The Delightful Cadogan	I have just returned from a very relaxing week at The Cadogan Hotel. We were very impressed with the whole weekend; the reception staff were very kind and made us feel very 'at home'. The hotel is small and very comfortable. Our bedroom was facing Sloane Street so was very good for people watching, both me my wife and I were amazed at how quiet the hotel was considering it is in the heart of Knightsbridge!"
77,602,"Feb 6 2006 	Loved it.	This is a leading hotel of the world. i really loved it. Me and my collleagues were spread in different rooms. Traditional rooms are edwardian but luxurious, some other rooms are comtemporary and very stylish, so you can go for the style you prefer. I was staying in a contemporary room, not one noise although in front of the main street. Very cosy cosy room, confortable beds, good level of room service. Also, You MUST have lunch in the restaurant and i very very much recommend the 2006 Prawn Cocktail which is served in a martini glass and 3 delightful layers of avocado, jelly and another sauce. Service was great too. If you want to live the luxurious and yet traditional english atmosphere, go there and you won't regret it. Otherwise, while shopping at Harrods or Harvey Nicks, pop in for an afternoon tea for the perfect afternoon!Hope this is useful."
78,602,"Jan 3 2006	Very nice London Boutique	Stayed in December, this is a very nice hotel. If you are tired of the chains try this. It is in an excellent location. the rooms are a bit small (surprise!) but well furnished"
79,602,"Jun 25 2005 	They have destroyed its charms and character	I was a regular visitor to The Cadogan because of its location (chic Sloane Street) and history (Oscar Wilde was arrested there) and had always enjoyed the special &quot;old world&quot; &amp; &quot;club feel&quot; of it, knowing that the Management and Team were around to assist and care. However, the hotel has changed hands recently and has been transformed to another one of these &quot;hip&quot; places soon to be forgotten. The unremarkable decor looks cheap and unfinished. The prices have gone up, and the faithfull long serving staff have disappeared. I now highly recommend &quot;Number Eleven Cadogan Garden&quot; for its British hospitality."
80,602,"May 29 2005 	Good service but older-style rooms have problems	I stayed only one night at the Cadogan. Service from the front desk staff and porters was excellent. However, I was staying in one of the older style, non-refurbished rooms at the top of the hotel. This resulted in some glitches, like the shower not running hot (although I could work around this by having a bath instead) and the doorhandle coming off the door (leaving me stuck in my room). There was also no airconditioning. I felt this was a little short of my expectations of a hotel at this price range. My colleagues who stayed in other rooms had none of these experiences."
81,602,"Apr 4 2005	Love it	I love the Cadogan - I stayed here as an 11 year old with my parents and never forgot its open lift and gorgeous decor and breakfasts!! I returned with my husband last year for a three night trip to see the sights and fell in love with it again. Its very old fashioned yet luxurious, the service is excellent, the breakfast varied and of good quality. It just has such a relaxing old world charm.... Great location too with Harrods &amp; Harvey Nikcs just a stroll away, as is the Kings Road and Chelsea in the opposite direction. South Ken tube station was a five minute walk away. I would heartlily recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to escape the faceless chain hotels."
82,602,"Jan 7 2005	The Cadogan a great hotel!	We stayed three nights and enjoyed the hotel a lot. It's an intimate, 4 stars hotel (despite the not functioning on site restaurant). We had room service twice, and the food was superb. The recently redone Contemporary rooms are beautiful and spacious, service ( turn down) was perfect, we got fluffy bath robes and slippers and the rates were quite affordable. We payed 105 British Pounds, breakfast and VAT excluded, for a double room, and thought it was more than worth.Location is also fantastic, right across the the garden, and at short walking distance from both tube stations, Knightsbridge and Sloane Square. We loved tha hotel and would stay again, without a doubt."
83,602,"Dec 6 2004	NOT a 5 Star Hotel	No soundproofing in the rooms, I could hear the person in the next room talking on her telephone. This is NOT a leading hotel of the world."
84,602,"Nov 11 2003	Charming peaceful and classy	I stayed at the Cadogan as a young woman - was thrilled to find it again as a wife and mother. The rooms are updated and spotless with excellent beds and baths, beautiful breakfasts, caring staff and most of all William Morris wall papers - a real, old openwork lift - a priceless location on Cadogan Square (ask for the garden key) between Knightsbridge and Sloane Square. Don't miss it!"

2,603,"Nov 23 2009 	An OK Stay	No frills to the rooms, but fair value - especially for Camden. Handy for the Tube, Camden markets &amp; Roundhouse. Breakfast good, room ok, bathroom far too small. Its overpriced - but so is almost every other hotel in London."
3,603,"Sep 24 2009 	Excellent for a budget hotel	I'm a seasoned budget traveller, so i research well for a decent and cheap place.When it comes to London, you're not going to get much better than this for such a low price.I paid about 60/night (which is cheap in London), and stayed in room 204.Big room, big bathroom. both clean.it does face the busy pub across the street, but as with most pubs, it winds down at midnight and is quiet. if you're an early sleeper, this is not for you.Many free wifi accesspoints to tap into, but my room also had a network cable.TV with 5 basic channels.breakfast was served, but I didn't have it when Camden high street is outside you're front door.there is no lift...so you're hiking up stairs if u have a lot of luggage.but if you're looking for a place to crash, easy access to central london...this is perfect"
4,603,"Sep 19 2009 	Good hotel close to underground and Camden.	We stay for 4 nights and is was a okay hotel. We first get a room, with bad smell af someone had smoke there, we ask for another room a get one on 2floor. 206. Perfekt.Nice little room,little bad but okay. We didnt have hot water for two days, but the owner was nice and he will give us 10% of the price,but we have already pay. So next time,there will be a next time he will give us 20% of the price. The service was good and the breakfast is top of the pop if you like full english breakfast,my partner do. :-) Yes there are a pub on the other side of the road,but it is London and in the middle of Camden. Undergroundstation Chalk Farm is two minutes away from the hotel and there are only 53 steps to the platform from the street :-)Yes i will recommend this hotel for friends and other.We will stay there again on our next trip to London."
5,603,"Aug 22 2009 	A compromise between a great location and basic facilities.	This was the first time i had visited Camden, so i wanted somewhere not only central but also reasonably priced. A quick search on google came up with the Camden Lock Hotel, so i booked it via the hotel's own website. In hindsight i could have probably found it cheaper elsewhere but i'll come to that later.The hotel itself was functional, with everything that needed to be there, but not a lot else. There was a small seating area near the reception desk which also doubled up as the location for breakfast in the mornings, but no seperate bar. Check in was very straight forward, and the member of staff who served us was friendly and helpful.The rooms were basic but comfortable, although slightly on the small side. There was a TV, a desk and chair, two beds, tea making set, and nothing else. No fridge, safe, or sofa, for example, so not really any good for relaxing. As we were only there for one night it wasn't much of a problem, but i probably wouldn't consider staying there for more than a couple of nights. The bathroom was a reasonable size, although our shower didn't get anywhere near the heat we set it too. Even with the dial at 50c it was nothing more than luke warm. Not a major problem and something that could hopefully be fixed quickly, it was only a small annoyance to us because of our short stay.The inclusive breakfast was one of the best parts of our stay. It was advertised as continental but it had nearly all the bits and pieces to make a cooked breakfast, as well as cereals, and toast. And it looked as if you could eat as much as you want, as it was all self service.There weren't any negatives to our stay, and the only area where the hotel loses marks are in what i see as slightly poor value for money. The cost of the room was 79 per night, and whilst i appreciate that is good value for a centrally located hotel, i still expected a bit more in the way of facilities both in the room and the hotel as a whole. Also a bit of decoration to give the hotel a bit of character wouldn't go amiss.Overall, i would probably stay there again but mainly for the location, and i would probably recommend it to friends and family, but not whole heartedly."
6,603,"Aug 22 2009 	So Impressed!!!!	Myself and my friend have had so many bad experiences with budget London Hotels - we havent got the money to pay big bucks to stay in plush places so we were delighted to find the Camden Lock Hotel! Not only is it opposite the Chalk Farm tube station which avoid luggins heavy luggage around, but its clean, modern and the staff were so friendly and helpful! We are so pleased to have found this little gem in our favourite place to visit in London - Highly recommend staying here if you are just looking for somewhere basic to have a comfortable nights sleep without having to pay through the nose but dont want to have to doss in a flea ridden hellhole! We will be returning very shortly!! :)"
7,603,"Aug 2 2009 	Excellent Value!	It's pretty hard to find a good value hotel in London for 79, so we were delighted to find one which was.Primarily we chose this hotel because we were seeing 'a-ha' at the Roundhouse opposite. The hotel is so near that you can practically see your room from the venue!The room was a good size, with a flat-screen digital TV with Freeview (I've not seen this in more expensive hotels), a good shower, and a comfy bed. The only disadvantage to the room we had was that it was dead opposite a pub, which can get noisy.The area is &quot;lively&quot;. There's a good kebab takeaway a few doors down and a decent pub across the road. The hotel is a very short walking distance from Chalk Farm Hotel Underground Station and is on a main bus route into Central London.We didn't have breakfast as we woke up too late, but this didn't matter as nearby Camden Market is highly recommended where you can get good food from almost every corner of the globe.One thing to watch is that there's a sneaky 3.50 charge if you want to pay by credit card. We also didn't see a lift, so if you're carrying heavy bags you might want to ask for a ground floor room. Other than that, the staff and hotel were excellent."
8,603,"Jun 10 2009 	Camden Lock Hotel has had a makeover!	Second time here for me. Again for a gig in Camden. I have no problems with this hotel- for the price and location you understand. Once I had checked in and walked to my room it was obvious to me that the hotel had had a makeover. New carpet, painted walls and railings. Even my single room had been redecorated with new curtains and double glazing! I was over the kebab shop (try a mixed grill for 6.50 for a guilty treat) and slept thrpugh the night. Breakfast as usual was OK for the price."
9,603,"May 12 2009 	Stay well clear of the single room....	I stayed in this hotel for one Saturday night to attend a wedding - as it was summer, I wish I'd just wandered the streets for the night. I had been warned that it could be noisey (a late opening pub on one side, and a club on the other) and had very low expectations. What I didn't realise is that, after 2am, everyone from the local bars heads to the all-night kebab shop underneath the rooms overlooking the street until -oh - 6/7am? Nightmare! I reckon the youth hostel would be a better bet for budget - as at least your paying less than half the price for not getting any sleep. And I was even quite drunk. And I had ear-plugs."
10,603,"Apr 20 2009 	Great Location Basic Hotel	I regularly stay in this hotel for business purposes. It is clean, accessible at all hours and on a great location. However, rooms are basic (Sky DTV is available!) and so is breakfast."
11,603,"Mar 23 2009 	Rubbish!	Hmmm, well the hotel is nothing to look at from the outside - great location for Camden, going to Roundhouse etc. Arrived and hotel is tired and unkempt. Staff not particularly attentive. We had to ask for an iron - this is a no frills hotel. Hot water was intermittent, if there at all - we complained and later received a 15 refund for this. It wasn't dirty, but didn't have a very clean feel about the place, I would only stay here again if there was nowhere else!"
12,603,"Mar 9 2009 	Perfect location for The Roundhouse	The Camden Lock Hotel is not impressive on first glance, in fact the thought &quot;What have I done&quot; sprang to mind but when you walk into the lobby you start to feel at ease. The worn stair carpet can be a bit off putting but the room is very very clean. It is a little bit basic, no airs and graces but it has a comfortable bed with a flat screen tv. The bathroom was a very small but it had a working shower and did the job it was meant to do. The view was of The Roundhouse, in fact from the bar we could see the window of our room. The fast food shop underneath was noisey but hidden in the back was a remarkably good jazz cafe that I would go to again. All in all I will use this hotel everytime I come to the Roundhouse, in fact I would use it more often that that for overnight trips to London."
13,603,"Nov 21 2008 	Fab for the price...	Don't be put off by the worn stair carpet that's the first thing you see upon entry---it gets much better!Our room (105) was roomy and clean, with comfy beds, tea/coffee, T.V., dressing table &amp; clothes hangers.The shower room/toilet were very clean , and the shower was very easy to use (always appreciated!). What's more, breakfast is buffet-style, so you can choose what you want, (and how much!!) .The staff are very friendly, and even looked after our luggage on departure day, saving us left-luggage charges.  We'll definately re-visit..."
14,603,"Oct 13 2008 	Cheap Adequate but perilous shower in 111!	Booking simple&amp; easy via Active Hotels. Excellent price, and so handy for Camden. Clean n tidy room -although stairs and comunal areas in disrepair , wobbly floorboards and some dirty stains on landings.Few coat hangers, no chair, no Freeview only terrestrial, no towel rail nor bin in the bedroom - but they arent exactly essential.However a shower is essential -and no matter how long it ran or how many different settings I tried the shower in room 111 only had SCALDING hot water...I have scaleded my scalp as I had to wash my hair.So its ok but not room 111! I stayed in another room there a couple of years ago and the shower was fine."
15,603,"Sep 7 2008 	Cheap cheerful and central!	Myself and a few friends all booked rooms at this hotel on a Friday night as we had tickets to Ash perform at the Roundhouse. The hotel was perfect for us. It is literally just over the road from the Roundhouse, approximately 10 mins walk up to Camden market and there are a few good reasonable places to eat. We had dinner at a Belgian restauarant nearby which was fairly cheap and good food. The pub just opposite the hotel the enterprise was great. really lovely atmosphere and great DJ (Sue)- seem to remember dancing around to sound of music songs at around 1am- very random! We were up for a night out and went to bed around 2am so didn't have any trouble with noise. The rooms were small but clean and at the end of the day exactly what we wee needing. We paid 68 for the double room which for it's location was great!"
16,603,"Aug 18 2008 	Best value in Camden by far	This is a great place to stay if needing to be in central Camden. We opted for the upgrade and the room was very nice and a decent size for London.It is noisy in Camden so you need to expect that outside the hotel and the breakfast buffet isn't particularly great, but the hotel is quiet and if you need a good value place to stay in NW1... go for it!"
17,603,"Jun 8 2008 	Good hotel	This hotel was great. The staff was helpful, the room was clean, it was in a pretty good location, and there is free wifi in the lobby. You can't beat the price for what you get, though the bathroom is quite small. I would stay here again."
18,603,"Jun 5 2008 	Great location!	The hotel is a great location and easy to find. Can be seen from the Chalk Farm tube station. Easy walking distance of Camden shops. Have stayed at the hotel twice, and not been disappointed. Its basic, but I have always found it to be clean, and hospitable. I have never had a problem with noise at night. A taxi from Victoria station is approximately 15. Have stayed in 3rd floor rooms both times, and not had a problem, except the lack of lift. Shower was sadly absolutely rubbish this time - worse than a dripping tap... Recommend for overnight stays but not any longer!"
19,603,"Feb 3 2008	Cheap an good location	We stayed at this B &amp;B as we were due to see Morrissey at the Roundhouse. After reading the reviews we were pleasently surprised.The room was clean and had all the expected amenities, even freeview! The staff were okay, they were I think Greek therefore the English wasn't that good but they were pleasent enough. The location is brilliant. Opposite a tube station and surrounded by Bars and restuarants. It is a lively area and there was some noise at night but if you want peace and quiet go to the countryside not London.We would definatly stay here again when we go to London as for the money it was excellent value!"
20,603,"Jan 9 2008 	Great Location	This hotel is in a great location. It is just minutes from the Chalk Farm station and the excellent Camden markets are in walking distance. The rooms are clean and modern and the staff were quite pleasent. The breakfast is a buffet with full english, toast and cornflakes. The only problem we had with this hotel was the noise, at night it was very loud outside and our room was facing a large billboard that had bright lights which our curtains didnt block out at all so the room was very bright at night. However for a budget hotel in London this is great, the price and breakfast is very good and its in an excellent location. I would go back to this hotel if I was on a budget but if not I would try book a more comfertable hotel in this area."
21,603,"Nov 17 2007 	i love the camden lock hotel	Lovely hotel, i can't believe how nice and cheap it is. Definitely i will be back. The room was clean and comfortable. I cannot believe the nonsense i read sometimes.....The breakfast was great, the staff were helpful and friendly. Very close to the camden market and it didn't break my bank!!!!"
22,603,"Sep 27 2007 	Disgraceful!	Firstly id like to say that I dont feel safe in the hotel or the area that Im staying in.I entered the hotel and was greeted by what do you want? I felt like I interrupted a mafias party or somethingPicture 1  shows my fire alarm which has so nicely been decorated by a carrier bag, I wonder is it works and if there was an actual fire in the building would I survive and get outPicture 2  has some beautiful hanging live wires fro the wallPicture 3  shows the immaculately clean toilet... I think they need to invest in some domestosPicture 4  some lovely mould in the toiletPicture 5 - again domestos comes to mind. The shower floor was so dirty that I had to stand on a clean towel this morning in order to have a showerPicture 6  our good old mould friend on the tiles againPicture 7  im supposed to have a clean shower from thisPicture 8  I asked for an ironing board. Nice rust and a whole on the board is really going to make me iron my clothesPicture 9  the amount of flys, mosquitos and other insects in this place made me feel as if Im living in the jungle Picture 10  Nice TapIm trying to make a joke out of this as much as possible in order to keep me sane but this accommodation is ridiculous. My university accommodation was much better than this. I cant believe I have to stay in a place like this"
23,603,"Sep 6 2007 	cheap and central	My expectations were quite low as I know what London standards are for inexpensive accomadations, and I have to say for the price, location, and cleaniness I would stay again. The rooms were equiped with the basics, tv, phone, ensuite bathrooms. The showers and beds were clean and comfortable. The staff friendly, and helpful. Nearby is the underground as well as good restaurants. My only complaint would be the noisy pub across the way, but they do close at some point. Overall I was quite surprised with this little find, and I would stay again."
24,603,"Jun 25 2007 	Good Basic Hotel	Just booked my second stay in the Camden Lock for next weekend. I went with a friend last Oct and was impressed by the location, breakfast (except the time of it! Too early!) and the overall good price. I'd reccomend it. Like others have said, it's a little shabby but clean enough and if all you want is a bed for a night or two then its perfect!"
25,603,"May 14 2007 	Ok overall	my experience was similar to other reviews.does not look enticing as you approach it, bit tatty and worn down - more like a hostel. Location is ok - next to chalk farm, and 20 mins to main stations. it is opposite a noisy bar - actually quite nice bar, good music and atmosphere.room was small, but manageable and the stairwell was grubby - but what do you expect for 56 quid a night in london. the whole decor in the place felt very 60/70's - could definately do with a quick refurb. or even a lick of paint.bathroom was tiny and im a big fella - but managed just about - the fan in bathroom made some funny noises, but wasnt that bad.best thing is a decent breakfast in morning - is buffet and has cereal, breads, fried stuff, toast jam etc....staff were ok. neither particularly helpful nor rude...all in all it is an ok hotel - not by any means a luxury standard. but ok if you just need a room for the night whilst sightseeing in london. it is a bit shabby though - so if you like your comforts and are really picky dont bother coz you'll just be dissapointed."
26,603,"Apr 18 2007 	Pleasant Surprise	Hotel was a pleasant surprise, expected usual London standards and this hotel was a LOT better than I hoped for. Next to a busy (noisy) pub but Camden (central) walkable and I'd recommend it highly. Breakfast times are early during the week but finish at 1000hrs on the weekend, all taken in a rather bland room but it was a reasonably varied &amp; hot self service selection, and as much as you like. Great location for couples and if used as a base absolutely spot-on. Don't be put off by outside photos, rooms were clean and sheets changed daily."
27,603,"Feb 26 2007 	Good clean basic hotel	My girlfriend and I booked this as we where going to a party in Camden Town. For 64 including a full english breakfast you cant go wrong. Its clean and basic but what more do you need when your out all day and just need a bed when you get back. 24 hr reception and location is spot on. Off the tube at Chalk Farm and its across the road. 10 min walk into Camden town and 20 mins to Euston station by foot.If we where to go back for a weekend, you cant beat it for value and location."
28,603,"Oct 17 2006 	Fairly noisy in room 207	Hey stayed two nights in room 207 on the main road so abit noisy, my friend was in 206, a much bigger roomand tucked around the corner. the hotel was basic but hey its only 64 for a double room,location is excellent,near the buzz and some very good restaurants.staff friendly enough,and clean...Note of warning dont leave cars unnattended in this street...ours got broken in to....they made a helluva mess."
29,603,"Feb 7 2006	Good budget hotel	The Hotel is in a great location, just five minutes walk from Camden market and bars etc. Yes, the hotel was basic, but the rooms were clean, the staff were very friendly and this is a great hotel if you're on a budget."
30,603,"Oct 30 2005 	Hated the camden lock hotel	The rooms are tiny, fairly clean but very hot.Mould in the showers and bathroom.It was very noisy (mainly traffic and a loud party in the kebab shop next door which lasted most of the night)The corridors are dirty, the carpets and stairways filthy.The breakfast is very basic and not appetising.The dining area leaves a lot to be desired ( grotty with a hole in the roof)I will not be staying there again."
31,603,"Dec 21 2004	I thought it was a crack den at first	Where do I start? It was Horrible, it was dirty, falling apart at the seams. The room was tiny, which I can Live with but the brown stains on the walls and what look to be high heal scrape marks up the wall I couldn't. I found the staff there to be very nice though, always there when needed, very helpfull. The location I agree is very good, it's accross the road from Chalk Farm Undergroung station and up the road from Camden market, but all this doesn't make up for the sheer horror that was the rooms. In my opinion go stay some where else."
32,603,"Nov 6 2004	Nice hotel yeah.	I quite enjoyed my six night stay at Camden Lock Hotel.An average hotel, however the staff there, especially Peter the manager, are much more than average: they are helpful and kind. What more does one want?The level of cleanliness is quite high - there is peace and relative quiet in the rooms. The room itself is comfortable, the beds etc ... and the bathrooms have brand new shower units and quite spacious, to the point of being quasi-luxurious!It is a hotel you feel good coming back to, tired, in the evening.And it's also one minute away from basic amenities, such as Chalk Farm underground station."

36,603,May 8 2007 	Piacevole sorpresa.
1,604,Aug 9 2009 	Filthy Flea Pit	We booked this hotel because the pictures that were advertised on the internet were very clean and homely. On arrival after being charged we were shown to our rooms. Our room was barely big enough for the double bed one of us had to sit on the bed when the other was getting ready there were bugs in the bed curtains were filthy only one small towel between two. The bathroom was disgusting. PLEASE PLEASE DONT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!	
2,604,Jul 20 2009 	Terrible - Just Terrible!	We spent 100 pounds per night ($200 Cdn) for a filthy rat trap of a hotel. It was such a disgusting hole
3,604,Mar 23 2008	This Camelot Hotel is not as advertised	This hotel seems a quaint little family run place in the advert. It is not. My sister and I stayed there this month for two nights. Our room did not look like the rooms advertised on the hotel web site.On arrival
4,604,Jan 4 2008 	Absolutely Disgusting!! Do Not Stay Here At Any Cost!!!	Where do i begin???? I booked this 'hotel' 4 weeks in advance directly with the owners via their website. We only booked to stay one night (new years eve) and we are SO lucky that it was only the one night because our expereince was absolutely terrible!!We arrived at the 'hotel' at 4pm to be told that our room was in a neighbouring 'hotel' that the owner also owned. I was immediately concerned- especially when the neighbouring 'hotel' looked even more awful than the first! We went up to the room and were faced with a disgusting state of a room. The bathroom was filthy and the carpet looked as though it had not seen a vacuum cleaner in months
5,604,Jun 4 2007	Death Trap - Do Not Stay Here!!!!!!!!!!	We had stayed at this hotel many times before and it was always wonderful - quaint
6,604,Apr 24 2007 	Clean but the not as the web-site	The only positive thing is that it seems to be clean (beside the an old carpet)The hotel/room has nothing to do with the web-site...Is 10 minute from Marble Arch
7,604,Feb 18 2007 	good enough	I was on a very limited budget for my trip to London
8,604,Aug 13 2006 	Used to be quaint and clean now it's uninhabitable	Since 1999 I have stayed at this hotel 4 times. It was owned and run by a group of people who understood that they had a quaint
9,604,Jun 10 2006	good location	Good location and good value for the money. Would recommend to tourist and to budget travelers. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable enough. THe shower was quite small however. Three girls weighing a total of little over 300 pounds put together and under 5'7 each had difficulties
10,604,May 1 2006	Dusty and Dirty	On arrival
11,604,Jan 13 2006	Check your room first	I am from New Zealand. While the booking was made for Camelot
12,604,Nov 28 2004 	Cheap and cheerful	Basic small hotel just off Edgware Road. Spent a few days here while down at a conference. My single room was tiny but no more so than my colleagues who paid more than twice that for similar sized room elsewhere. En-suite room clean and staff friendly and helpful and always someone to let you back in at 2am. Where else can you stay in London for 40 quid a night	
13,604,May 5 2008 	Hôtel à déconseiller		
14,604,Feb 11 2007 	Desilusion		
1,606,Oct 26 2009 	Very Good Choice	Had a great stay here. Arrived at hotel at 8:00am after long flight from Australia. We were given a room straight away and offered breakfast as well - no problems!!. The rooms were typical London but clean and fresh as well as very good value. Great location and overall this is a good choice for a few nights and I would recommend to anyone.
2,606,"Oct 15 2009 	Neat!	I read the previous reviews before I booked this hotel, and I can only agree that this is a really fresh, neat and tidy tourist class hotel! The rooms are very spacious with light colours and modern furnitures. The bathrooms small but fully tiled, feels newly refurbished, and contains everything you need. We stayed in a triple room, and there was a small &quot;hallway&quot; where the bathroom is, so it was separated from the bedroom in a nice way. The breakfast room is rather small, but light and modern, and the breakfast is a traditonal continental. Location is excellent, right in between 4 Tube stops; Paddington, Lancaster Gate, Queensway and Bayswater, with just a few minutes walking distance to each of them.(The only drawback was the boring view towards a backyard, but its almost always like that in the old Victorian houses in London. )"
3,606,"Oct 8 2009 	Clean quiet and bigger than expected.	I stayed at Caring Hotel in the Bayswater area of London for one week on vacation. I am always looking for a bargain hotel but I am pretty picky about cleanliness. I must say that I thought Caring hotel was great! The room was on the first floor, which in England means the second floor. We initially chose Caring because we needed accomodations for three people in one room and most of the hotel chains that I was familiar with could only accomodate two to a room. Our room was clean and the in-room bathroom appeared to be recently remodeled. There was also a bathroom just across the hall that was never occupied and very clean. Our room was cleaned daily by housekeeping and always to my satisfaction. The staff was friendly and very helpful with directions and tips on how to use the bus system. It was only a short walk to the Paddington underground stations (I think this is the best line to be on becuase of easy access to everything) or the Queensway Underground stations and the bus stops. I flew out of Gatwick and was able to catch a bus directly to the Victoria Station to catch the Gatwick Express and it was very easy even with my luggage. The continental breakfast did lack a little but it was enough to get the day started and it was included in the cost of the room. This was my third visit to London and by far the best and biggest budget room I have had. My biggest complaint is that the shower water could have been hotter because it seemed to be set on a specific temperature and couldn't be made any warmer. I found myself letting the shower run for quite a while waiting for it to warm up and even flushing the toilet to give it a boost. Other than that, it was a very pleasant surprise for such a bargain. We also had a problem with our television and lights not working at one point but the staff was very quick to fix that problem. I will definately stay here again!"
4,606,"Sep 21 2009 	GREAT HOTEL GREAT PRICE GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD GREAT LOCATION!	My husband and I stayed for two nites in September in the Caring Hotel. Webooked this hotel based on the great ratings on TripAdvisor.com and anotherfriend's suggestion of that area. It's a 5 minute walk from the Queensway Tubestation and 3 minute walk to Hyde Park/Kennsington Park. About a 10 minute walkfrom Paddington area. We payed 54 british pounds a nite which is equivilant toapproximately $90 US Dollars. The hotel was a great deal considering theprestigious area it was located in and the aformentioned nearby amenities. Thestaff were excellent and friendly. We asked them for more pillows which theyimmediately got and also my husband had a sore throat and asked for salt togargle and the staff raced to the kitchen to retrieve that as well. It's a 4minute walk to a nice pub called Black Lion, and just a little futher to thelocal Starbucks. The rooms weren't as small as I'd expected from reading theother reviews, just appropriate given the price point. Our bathroom had a tuband shower and there was a small flat screen TV near the bed. We were in room12 which is above the lobby and thus abated any potential noise from a lowerroom. They served breakfast but we went out for starbucks coffee both days.All in all this is an excellent hotel and a great deal. There was also a 'hopon hop off' bus tour stop a minute walk away as well."
5,606,"Sep 21 2009 	Respect for the customer	We stayed at Caring for six nights with a three day break in between.Caring is one of the hotels I would love to stay again in my next trip to London.I've been in this city five times in hotels around earl's court or Victoria,most of them more expensive than Caring but not up to the standard of Caring.Rooms were very very clean,new towels every day,close to everything,breakfast also very good,a total satisfaction.Someone can spend a fortune staying in luxury hotels in London,for us a hotel is only to sleep and if it's clean and not far from the city it's fine.At last a hotel with good price in London and also repsect for the customer.One minus is some other customers do not realise that it's not their home and shout in the middle of the night waking other peopole up.."
6,606,"Sep 14 2009 	It really was a good value	I made the mistake of getting a room without an ensuite toilet. If I had paid attention and gotten one, it would have been pretty close to perfect for me. The room was not huge, but by no means too small. It did have its own shower that worked just fine. The room was very clean and modern, and had a kettle for making tea and what-have-you. The staff were extremely professional and helpful.The location was quite close to 2 tube stops, as well as Paddington train station which proved to be extremely convenient, since the express train to Heathrow runs between the airport and Paddington. Moreover, the Paddington station has some restaurants and a small grocery store for necessities. Upon arrival, I was able to pick up some stuff at the drug store and get a pay-as-you go phone. The hotel is also near Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park, and a bit of a walk will get you to Knightsbridge as well which is neat. One thing I will say about the area that was odd; most of the surrounding buildings were hotels though they looked to be converted mansions. As a result, most every place near by plied tourist business. I was thankful however for a minimart that was open late and served samosas---crucial for when the pub closes. There was a bit of street noise, but it wasn't keeping me up too bad. Walls weren't the thickest either, but the noise was not too much of a problem.The breakfast was no frills; coffee, cereal, juice, and toast. The hotel did lack an elevator, which posed no problem as a passably in-shape adult. However, I could easily imagine the very young or the elderly not really enjoying having to climb stairs.Overall, the Hotel Caring offers compelling value in a convenient location, and I would highly recommend it. I would definitely consider returning here."
7,606,"Aug 26 2009 	Good value for money	Stayed at the Caring Hotel for 2 nights a couple of weeks ago. The hotel is a good base to see London, though the underground is a good 5 minute walk away. The room was small but definitely clean. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast is good, though it's a continental breakfast and not an English breakfast, as it did say on our booking. There was no AC present in the room, so we had to open a window to cool down. Unfortunately, there was construction in front of the hotel, so it became very noisy. Also, we were awoken by construction workers very early on Saturday. I know the hotel can't do anything about that, but I still wanted to mention it. If I would worked at a hotel, I would at least have apologized for the inconvenience. All in all good value for money. If you're on a budget I definitely would recommend this hotel."
8,606,"Aug 22 2009 	Super hotel as a Base to see London	Having read the blogs from other Hotel users here, I was quite surprised to find that the rooms weren't too small after all. The Hotel is only a few minutes from Hyde park and 5 minutes walk to the tube. The rooms seemed freshly renovated and during our stay the final touches were being added to the reception. We were a bit disappointed that the Hotel no longer does an English breakfast but got a 5% rebate on the bill because of it. There's so much to see in London and it's easy to get around with the public transport. We found the best method was to see a couple of things in the morning/midday and armed with coffee to go and a muffin from starbucks then go to one of the many parks, relax and put your feet up for an hour or two before we set off for the next attraction."
9,606,"Aug 16 2009 	Wonderful stay!!	We were very impressed with this hotel and would highly recommend it! I am a travel agent and know that you get what you pay for- but this hotel is great value for money. Location: Great location, close enough to tube stations. The area is very lovely, it seems very classy and upmarket. Rooms: Modern with enough room to move around with a few suitcases. Nice new flat screen tv. We shared a bathroom but still had a sink in the room which was handy. The only complaint I would have about the room would be the size of the beds. My boyfriend and I are pretty tall so we felt squished in the bed- but we still managed. Shared bathroom: Very nice!! Only once did I have to wait for someone to get out of the shower. Our bathroom was updated, so it was very modern and was cleaned daily. Service: Everyone was very friendly. There is always someone at the front office to help you out. The breakfast ladies are also very nice. Breakfast: Was great! Selection of cereals, juices, tea, coffee and fruit. If you do like your meats you won't get that at this hotel, but this didn't bother us at all. Other notes: Like most hotels around Europe there is no elevator so you do have to take your luggage up the stairs- this was our last hotel out of 5 around Europe so by this point this was a normal thing to do. They were doing renovations in the front lobby, but they never started them until about 11am, so on most days we were usually out exploring. I would love to see it when they have completed them- they have done a wonderful job at updating the rest of the hotel. All in all Hotel Caring was a great place to stay in London!! I would stay here again with no hesitation!"
10,606,"Aug 9 2009 	Good value good location	We chose the Caring Hotel because we had an overnight stay in London and wanted to be near Paddington Station, where the airport train arrives. It was a short walk, maybe 5 blocks. The hotel was clean and the staff was helpful. Our room was small and basic, but for the price it was a good deal. We splurged and got an ensuite room - I was pleased that there was a bathtub. No complaints at all."
11,606,"Jul 31 2009 	Good location fairly affordable nothing special. Would stay again if on a tight budget.	I chose the Caring because of its Top Value status here. Location was important, as it's a short walk from Paddington. I booked a twin room with ensuite bathroom for 76 (continental breakfast included).The room was quite average: not big or small, and clean enough. The shower had good water pressure, and the tv was a new Samsung flatscreen with tens of channels. The second bed was a foldaway which would have ensured a sore back so we ended up sharing the double bed, which was quite comfortable. The bedding was typical English wool blankets covered with a sheet too small to keep the wool from touching you. ;) The room was quiet enough because there were no noisy guests in the adjacent rooms.The service was efficient yet a bit quirky (because of the girl at the reception with a strong East European accent; she gave us all the information regarding our stay starting with &quot;I have more bad news for you&quot; - these bad news were that the breakfast doesn't contain bacon, sausages or pork, there is no lift and our room is on the 4th (more like 6th according to our counting) floor, and that the room wasn't ready yet). We didn't mind any of this so it was actually quite endearing.All in all, a nice enough stay, and a good value by London standards. Recommended in this category."
12,606,"Jul 28 2009 	Great location great huge bathtub B and B	Quiet street in Queensway area, where there are tons of great restaurants and near several Tube and train stations. Nice breakfast in the morning. Charming rooms with very good rates."
13,606,"Jul 26 2009 	Recommended excellent value	Not luxurious by any means, but for the price it must be hard to beat. It has all the basics you'd want from a hotel. I had an excellent stay there. Good location, just north of Kensington Gardens and a 10-minute walk from Queensway underground station."
14,606,"Jul 21 2009 	Very Nice Hotel	We stayed at Caring Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is clean, newly renovated and the staff are helpful. Location was very important to me so here is information on that:Location Good News - The hotel is in a nice neighborhood on a pretty (almost picturesque) and very quiet street. It is centrally located between Paddington train station and Queensway tube station - both are a ten minute walk. The Queensway area is a shabby-chic multi ethnic area - tons of good affordable restaurants. Paddington is a typical train station neighborhood with inexpensive restaurants and trinket stores. If you are arriving from Heathrow the express train goes directly to Paddington - which is nice. Also if you are planning any excursions involving trains, it is nice to be close to Paddington.Location Bad News - The 10 minute walk from the tube station can be pretty long after a busy day. The hotel is not centrally located to all the main attractions for London. There is not a lot of night life for younger travelers.I looked pretty hard for a hotel that was reasonably priced and centrally located. Unless you can get closer to central London, this is a great option. I think for the price it would be hard to beat."
15,606,"Jul 20 2009 	Great Deal (Good location nice staff)	We spent 3 nights there from July 11th till July 14th 2009.The hotel is under renovation and the last day, it was difficult to access the lobby. We have no reason to complain about the noise of the workers as they work during the day (not before 9AM) but if you like to sleep a lot in the morning, it is something you should consider and check directly with the hotel if renovation is over.This hotel was really clean (room 15), with a private renovated bathroom with toilet and bathtub. There is a small flat TV, a water heater with coffee &amp; tea. We had 2 towels but no soap/shampoo.Breakfast from 7h30 till 9h00 during week days and from 8h00 till 9h15 on Sunday.Breakfast is continental with toasts + English bread/muffin + cereals + juices + eggs &amp; cheese. Nothing to complain about but nothing exceptional either. We really enjoyed our stay for the price we payed. The location was really convenient at about 5 minutes to Queensway (central line) and bus stop 94-390 and 6 minutes to Bayswater (circle line - direct to St pancras station for Eurostar trains to Paris).On the last day, you can leave your luggage for 2 per item (but the (really friendly) lady at the desk charged us 5 for 2 big bags and 2 small bags instead of 8)The only Cons for me:I read on other reviews that the wall are thin and it is indeed true but not a deal breaker. I was a little afraid as I once stayed in a hotel where I could hear my neighbor snore. This is not the case here, we could only hear our neighbors when they talk loud.Conclusion: I will stay again in this hotel, this is not a 5* but it costs 5 times less too !Loris"
16,606,"Jul 18 2009 	Spacious Room close to hyde park	Hotel is 10min walk from nearest underground stop. Hyde park/kensington gardens is 5 min walk. We had a Large room, had single double and fold out bed although there was just the 2 of us. Bathroom tiny though. Breakfast was just continental, enough to get you started for the day. Overall stay was fine."
17,606,"Jul 13 2009	A great hotel	I stayed in the hotel with my girl friend for 2 nights after i left a hotel in marbel arch area.the staff is excellent and friendley and willing to help.the room i stayed in was new , big and very clean.the area is very peacefull and queensway tube station is a 7 min walk away,the price is good 74 pound and even if u pay a little more its worth it."
18,606,"Jul 9 2009 	Good value! will come back again!	Booked a single room with ensuite for just 54 pounds a night. Like what others say , the room is clean, modern and space efficient . Location is convienient as the hotel is served by 3 different tube station. It is also near to many resturants , pubs and cafes. You can also access Kensington Park easily as well.Breakfast is quite basic but adequate for me . Another bonus is there is free wifi , unlike other hotels where you have to pay for it. Staff are also friendly and helpful.Overall , lovely hotel for a good price. Will choose Caring Hotel again !"
19,606,"Jul 7 2009 	Caring Hotel London	This hotel was excellent. It was situation near two tube stations and a short walk from Paddington main train station. It was also just a stroll from Hyde Park. We were able to stroll from the hotel to the Royal Albert Hall, The National History Museum, Science Museum, The Victoria and Albert Museum and Harrods and I am not a great walker. The hotel was in a very quiet, pleasant area. There was lots of local shops, restaurants and an Odeon Cinema. The hotel was going through some modernisation at the minute but nothing disturbed us in any way. The staff were excellent and more than helpful. Our room was excellent. I have MS and I enquired about a low floor as i had booked a room with two single beds and a shared bathroom, just to keep costs down (silly me as an en suite I believe is a must). Anyway I enquired with the hotel about a lower floor and there was not one available. When we arrived, Allen, the assistant manager, had very kindly upgraded up to a basement room (which was excellent), which had a double bed, two single beds and a newly fitted en suite, at no extra charge. I must point out that he did also mention that this was in exceptional circumstances, but I was delighted and thought that for a hotel in London to do something like that, I was very impressed. You were greeted warmly in entering and leaving the hotel and nothing was too much trouble. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to everyone. Although the upgrade was a one-off, I would still book the hotel again. The prices are more than reasonable for London and it is situated in an excellent area and safe area, even coming back from the West End shows after eleven at night, we still felt safe. The breakfast room has been modernised and there is a continental breakfast every morning with all the usual UK cereals in little boxes, boiled eggs, croissants, cheeses, tea and toast etc. Anyway I think you would be bored with bacon and eggs every day and we didn't miss it. So book this hotel, you won't be disappointed. We stayed a week and we had a brilliant time."
20,606,"Jun 18 2009 	Good budget hotel in nice area	Stayed only 1 night at this hotel. Booked it as I thought it was near Paddington Station but it's actually a 10 mins walk. So not as convenient as I would like it to be. But it's a nice district with very fancy neighbours. Hence's it's surprisingly to find a budget hotel in this area. The room is very clean. I got a double room with a shared bathroom. The bathroom is very clean as well and it's mostly available. Only had to queue once for it. Free wi-fi in the room too. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Note to those who are driving, do not park your car immediately outside the hotel. It's reserved for residents but you can park in the adjacent road but it might be difficult to find a lot."
21,606,"Jun 17 2009 	Great CLEAN Budget Hotel but...	...VERY THIN walls! My husband and I stayed at Caring Hotel for 4 nights in room 15 (superior ensuite; double with private bathroom) and I've listed below the Pros/Cons:PROS: Clean, Affordable (72/night thru Venere with 4% disc), near Paddington tube/train station for Heathrow Connect (10-15mins walk), near the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations (former is slightly closer), friendly/helpful staff and decent size room (for London), and our bathroom was newly renovated.CONS: the walls are thin (we could hear our neighbours in room 14 when they were having talking...and they weren't yelling/shouting...we could even hear when they shut their curtains!!! We didn't feel comfortable talking after 11pm, so had to whisper so we didn't bother/wake up our neighbours. Also can hear other guests when walking down the stairs in the hallway) and the bathroom was not meant for anyone over 6ft. My husband had to duck each time he had to go thru the bathroom doorway and had to hunch over when taking a shower. I'm barely over 5ft and I was able to easily touch the ceiling when I was taking a shower (palms in full contact)! Having said this, we didn't ask for another room, my husband was too lazy to change our room and was willing to suck it up for 4 nights.We lucked out that our room was ready for us when we got there at 9am so managed to check-in right away (instead of having to store our luggage and later coming back to check-in at 11am)!I can't really comment on the breakfast as we only went down once and there wasn't much food left (at the time we didn't realize that they were closing; we were 10mins late), but the staff didn't say anything and still served us. Much appreciated! :o) I also can't comment on WIFI since we didn't bring our laptop with us.When we were there it was pretty cold (14 - 18C) so kept the windows closed. I noticed there weren't any window screens, so I don't know how it would be in the summer time if any mosquitoes would come in with the windows open (since the hotel doesn't have any AC)?? This may not be an important factor for most people, but after I stayed in a hotel in Florence, Italy with no AC and no window screens and woke up with 20+ mosquito bites the next morning this is a huge consideration for me!Overall we would still recommend this hotel to friends and family but would advise them about the thin walls and ceiling height."
22,606,"Jun 15 2009 	very comfy good budget hotel	Hotel with a good sized room (#43). I was in a double bed room with shower, but shared toilet (there were 2 on the floor i was on). The room was comfy and clean although it was on the 4th floor which was a pretty far trek each night to go up on the steep stairs. Only wifi in the lobby and 2nd floor, could have used a hair dryer in the room, and the shower's drainage was a little slow, so water would build up. The breakfast included was really just toast, cereal, juice and a few other small things.... i ended up going to some nearby restaurants for an english breakfast most of the time. Staff was friendly and helpful.There are a few metro stations nearby, but all are around a 7 min walk away from the hotel. the area seemed pretty quiet and safe, and there are a few stores nearby you can pick up things from. I also liked the fact that the paddington rail station was nearby...so it made heading out of town for day trips and going to the airport super easy. The underground stations also give you quite a lot of flexibility on how you can get to your destinations. All in all, I picked it because it was a clean well reviewed budget hotel. With that in mind, it is an excellent choice."
23,606,"Jun 7 2009 	The BEST budget friendly hotel in London	We stayed for 4 nights at the Caring. I booked via email and always received a response within the hour, they were also happy to allow me to pre-pay the tariff (which I always prefer to do).When we arrived there was champangne &amp; roses in the room that my sisters (who was travelling with me) husband had arranged. No big deal right??? no....the person at reception actually went out to the shop &amp; bought them himself (rather than ordering them in) to leave in the room as this is not usually a service they provide.I won't lie....the room was small (twin share with share bath)....but then you don't come to London to sit in your room!!! They were refurbished, with comfortable beds &amp; daily housekeeping services. We had to take a room with shared bathroom as none with ensuite were avail, we only shared the brand new &amp; immaculately clean bathroom with 2 other rooms - which is good by london standards. The included breakfast was great &amp; the dining room again is newly renovated &amp; very clean. There are heaps of restaurants in the area, internet cafe &amp; convenience shop across the road, tube is a 5-6 minute walk - but the hotel is located in a very quiet , safe(&amp; somewhat exclusive) street.I have stayed in many different hotels in London, but I will now not stay anywhere else but the Caring. Thanks to all the staff on a job very well done!!"
24,606,"May 20 2009 	Great value budget hotel	Very friendly, helpful staff. I had basic room but it was obviously newly referbished and the shared bathroom, although very small, was clean and modern. Hotel is in a good location. The only thing I wasn't keen on was the breakfast room in the basement. I would be happy to stay there again when in London."
25,606,"May 16 2009 	Great Staff. Closer to Queensway not Paddington	I just stayed one night at Caring Hotel in mid May during my two-week Europe holiday trip. The staff there are very helpful. I was told that breakfast served from 7:30am to 9:30am but when I went down at 9:10am, the staff told me that breakfast finished at 9am. One of the staff saw me very upset so she found me some coffee, bread and cheese and offered me to sit down in the breakfast room to enjoy my meal. I appreciated this lady very much.About my room, they upgraded me to a bigger room but it was one of the &quot;old&quot; rooms. It looks old and dirty and deifinitely needs to do some renovation works.The hotel does not have a lift and is a bit far away from Paddington station. In fact, it is much closer to Queensway. I sweated and was exhausted after dragging my lugguage (less than 20 Kg - weighted in the airport) to / from the hotel from / to Paddington station. The only good things are you do not need to move your lugguage up and down the stairs in the station and on the way to the hotel."
26,606,"Apr 25 2009 	New room good location and clean.	Only stayed one night and the workman were in during the day. Having said that the room was clearly only just finished with new bathroom and tv. There was free internet and a decent breakfast included. The location is close to Paddington which is ideal, and there are lots of local restuarants close by. A very enjoyable stay!"
27,606,"Apr 2 2009 	Great Stay - Clean and Super Service!	Spent a week here during the end of March. Was impressed by its ranking on TripAdvisor and I can see why. There were three of us and we were impressed w/ the cleanliness and service of the hotel. Our room was ensuite and it was an actual bath tub and shower which beats the slender shower you often see.Its location is excellent - definitely print out a map before you head out as the street layout is a bit confusing. There are great pubs nearby (Leinster Arms and Prince Alfred each do not mind kids) and you can check out nearby Hyde Park or take the tube to the tourist sites. It was pretty much equidistant from Queensway and Lancaster Gate (about 7-8 minute walk) and tack another minute if you need Paddington or Bayswater.The staff were very helpful - only difficulty might be if you have problems w/ stairs. The breakfast was very simple, but that is because they are working on the basement where they'll be able to go back to the cooked breakfasts.We paid 88 pounds per night and w/ the exchange rate in our favor it was a heck of a bargain. It is not fancy by any means, but if you want a quiet, clean, fair-priced room this place will not let you down."
28,606,Mar 18 2009 	Great place to stay...	Very clean and nice staff. There where always available to help. Very close to tube and hyde park.I will most certainly recommend this hotel to my friends and I will stay there again.
29,606,"Mar 17 2009 	location and helpful staff	My 18 year old son and I stayed at the Caring in March. The staff were helpful and especially accomodating storing our rented bicycles inside for us. Our room, room 10 faced an inner courtyard and had a flat screen TV, twin beds and a brand new bathroom with tub and shower. My son enjoyed the free WiFi.They are undergoing a small renovation of the main floor, but that did not effect our enjoyment. They do not offer a full English breakfast during the winter months (go figure?). The Continental breakfast was very plain and the breakfast room was tiny. All was a minor inconvenience when you consider that you are steps to the tube, Kensington Gardens, Notting Hill and a short hike to Regent Street shopping. The neighbourhood is pleasant with many hotels and small shops."
30,606,"Mar 5 2009 	Basic Central Hotel	Stayed here for 2 nights so that we could easily reach central london. Was easy to get to Oxford Street, could be done by tube but we liked the walk along the edge of Hyde Park. Hotel was clean, room was a good size with tea, coffee &amp; a tv. Our main issue was the breakfast which was extremely basic &amp; the staff at breakfast weren't particularly friendly! That said the people working on the reception were always friendly &amp; helpful. We didn't have an en suite room but are pretty sure we were only sharing a bathroom with one other person, we never had to wait to use it &amp; it was always clean. The hotel is probarbly priced about right for the location but we would have been happier paying what we paid if breakfast had been good!!"
31,606,"Mar 3 2009 	A great budget hotel in London!	We just stayed at Caring hotel for 5 nights and we are overall very satisfied what we get. The rooms are recently refurbised so the standard in the room is far better than other hotel at the same price level. We had both room with private bathroom and only private shower, but it's no problem to have shared toilet. The toilet is clean and we only had to share the toilet with two other rooms. The shower worked properly and we never had problem with cold water. The staff was friendly and we also had continental breakfast instead of English b. Only two small minus with the hotel: 1. The walls must be very thin and the sound was carried very easily between the rooms. 2. We must paid a fee to let luggages at the hotel on departing day (1 for small bag and 2 for big suicase). I had never have to pay for that.... Overall, the most important thing is that the room was very clean and Next time we go to London we will definitely book that hotel again!"
32,606,Feb 6 2009 	Short Stay Perfection	The hotel is excellent value. We had an on suite room and it had been refurbished. It was clean and quiet. The breakfast was continental as the kitchen is being refurbished. Location is just five minutes walk to the Tube.The staff are most helpful and thoughtful. Only negative is that we could not rely on the early morning call arrangements.Even so we would happily stay there again when we visit on a short break.
33,606,"Jan 17 2009 	Best value Ive found in London	This hotel represents good, basic, value for money. For 50 for a double room in a decent location in London I was apprehensive as to what we would find. However, the rooms were a good size (for London) Spotlessly clean, and the service was friendly and efficient. Stayed in a room without bathroom but the shared bathroom was equally spotless. Will be using this hotel again soon."
34,606,"Dec 9 2008 	Just what we expected	We chose this hotel after reading the reviews and crossed our fingers, hoping that we made the right choice...We certainly did, the room was pretty spacious to put our 3 suitcases and had basic facilities, just like we expected. The breakfast was good too..good English breakfast in a nice setting at the basement.All in all, I'd recommend this place. Its just less than 10 minutes walk from Lancaster Gate tube..however we found the area too quiet for our liking as walking back late at night proves a little eerie."
35,606,"Nov 12 2008 	Fantastic value for money - great location.	Stayed at Caring Hotel near Paddington for one night in a twin with no bathroom. The location of the hotel is great, about 5/10 min walk from Paddington and 5 mins from several other tube stops. The hotel was very clean, furniture in room seemed v.new and the room was surprizingly large. Although we had a room with out bathroom, the bathroom was right next to our room and again it was clean and hygienic. I have stayed in many budget hotels in London including an Easy hotel, and this has been by far the best value for money I have found. I didn't have breakfast so can't coment on that, but for 26 per person for central London it was fantastic. I would happily stay again with friends, and would take a partner but would probaby book a room with bathroom for that. It is by no means luxurious, but is basic, clean and has everything you need for a couple of night stop in central London."
36,606,"Oct 23 2008 	Didn't realize it at the time	My husband and I used frequent flyer miles to get us to Ireland for a visit with family and had to fly through Heathrow to do so. Decided to spend at least an afternoon in London.Booked hotel through venere.com and didn't realize from website that all rooms here have single beds. My husband and I were very pleased with the size and general comfort of our room and en suite bathroom but we were surprised by the lack of a queen bed in the room (or even full bed). The two beds were quite small and while we pushed them together, it would have been nice to know this is advance.It could also be an English - American language thing -- double room for me indicates 2 people not double beds.anyway, I was told that this hotel doesn't have rooms with anything but single beds. nice location - neighborhood and not bad walk to/from Paddington Station -- we maximized our time and took Heathrow Express. Worked well."
37,606,"Sep 18 2008 	the other side of the story...	Almost everyone writes excellent comments about this hotel. I fully agree but I also wish to share the other side of the story about this hotel with the readers too. I booked for a room with bath &amp; toilet attached but was disppointed that the shower broke down and was not fixed for 2 days. Having to travel up &amp; down the staircase to the bathroom was really inconvenient for me. Also after a 20 hour-door-to-door travelling I didn't really want to face such a situation. To make matters worse, when I came back (tired) on my 2nd night) one Receptionist wasn't too pleased when I asked if my shower was fixed or not. She perhaps thought I was scolding her. I was tired and certainly asked her in a tired manner. All she had to do was just replied politely. The breakfast which was excellent, with several types of cereals, eggs, bacon strips, sausages etc. But to have the same food for seven mornings was quite boring for me. Wished the hotel could offer room rates without breakfast too. Also, to sit and listen to unpleasant conversations from the hotels regular/long stay guests at breakfast each morning wasnt a pleasant way to start off a morning for me either. Anyway, all in all it had been a pleasant stay for me. Most staff were polite and some even went out of their way to help. I really appreciate it. I also appreciate the reasonable room rates offered. But, I guess 2-3 nights stay at Caring Hotel would be nice for me, not more than that."
38,606,"Sep 12 2008 	Saved my life	Bolted in here after an unsatisfactory stay elsewhere. Friendly and helpful reception staff. Basic accomadation but clean, reasonable sized room, en-suite and adequate cooked breakfast served promptly. 52 for a night, single room. Probably amongst the best value for money hotels in London if you are ok with basic , clean , en-suite B&amp;B. Some cheaper, non en-suite options were available if you don't mind shared facilities."
39,606,"Aug 27 2008	A ""caring"" hotel with a caring staff	We came from Romania. We stayed for 5 nights, didn't really know what to expect but were very pleasantly surprised that all went so well! the reception desk staff were ALL very nice at ALL times, helpful with information, etc...the breakfast was good, the whole hotel is nicely redecorated, bathrooms are very close to the rooms and a pleasure to be used. the only down side was that there was no lift, and for the people who stay on the fourth floor, it can be a drag. (Listen to the band Foreign Humor) the hotel is almost across from Hyde Park and Queensway tube station is pretty close."
40,606,"Aug 11 2008	Good Value typical london hotel	we stayed in this hotel for 3 nights while visiting london. It is very close to Hyde park, and a fiarly busy street with restaurants and fast food places. A few touristy shop. It is a short walk from paddington stations, but you do have to lug your luggage up a slight hill. Nothing too traumatic. There is no lift/elevator in the hotel, so be prepared to carry your bags up the stairs. Breakfast is included in the price, ou go downstairs and tell them that you would like breakfast and they cook it while your waiting, they have cereal, juices and coffee ( be aware though, there is NO aircon in the rooms or the breakfast room, and the juices are room temperature) they bring out some toast, and then each plate has 2 strips of bacon, two eggs, and a sausage. Over all this is a decent hotel for price in london, and the cleanliness is ho-hum, but it is decent nonetheless. I would recommend this for budget traveling."
41,606,"Aug 5 2008	Great Hotel Great Location	We stayed at the Caring Hotel for 6 nights (2 adults and 1 child). It is a wonderful location. It was very close to Paddington station (and other stations) - which was nice when we are carrying a lot of luggage. It is a quick walk to Hyde Park and a nice shopping area that has lots of activity. The hotel street is very quiet and pleasant.Front desk staff was very polite and helpful, as was all the other staff we encountered. Our room was on the first floor - facing the street, right next to the front desk. It was a nice sized room - with a large bathroom. It was very clean. The furnishings were a bit dated, but they were in good condition and added to the charm of the hotel. The only negative with the room was it's location - it was loud at times with people coming and going in the front door. Other than that, the room was great.The breakfast was fantastic as well. The food was good - it was nice to eat with other guests and meet other travelers. You can't beat the price and the location. We would stay here again without a doubt!!!"
42,606,"Jul 23 2008 	Best value for money	Stayed in the Hotel for 4 nights in July.Found it from TripAdvisor, compared rating of a hotel and room prices. It was the best value for money for London.Situated near Hyde Park, 5-7 minutes from Bayswates and Queensway stations and 10 minutes from Paddington. From Heathrow we used underground (about 1 hour, 3.5 pounds) or you can travel to Paddington by train (15-30 minutes, 7-23 pounds).The hotel is nice decorated but it is now being refurbished, so on the second and third floor you can see workers and all the attributes of the repairs. We lived in the forth floor, where everything was done. The only negative thing about the hotel is a steep ladder. With our heavy luggage spent about 10 minutes to &quot;climb&quot;. But otherwise OK.Stayed in a twin room with bathroom. Quite a big room with 2 beds, a wardrobe, 22&quot; TV-set and a small bathroom. Everything you need for comfortable budget staying! :)Receptionists were friendly and helped with everything we applied for. In the first day we even had Russian-speaking receptionist (what a surprise!), so nothing to worry about at all.Tasty English breakfast was included (another very nice thing about this hotel), so had energy for long trips.Payed at last day and put our luggage in a special room (cost 3 pounds for 2 big suitcases).So, overall expression is very good. One of the best budget hotels in London!"
43,606,"Jun 17 2008 	You get what you give	The decoration is like from the 60s, the floor really makes some noise, it only has stairs, but my stay there really paid off. The double room w/shower is not that small and I found it very nice and clean. The neighbourhood is great for more quiet, contemplative travellers. Taking a walk around Hyde Park after eating an english breakfast at the hotel really shows a peaceful and priceless side of that huge city. All that just 10, 15 minutes by bus from Oxford Circus."
44,606,"Jun 11 2008 	Great location and value	The location of the hotel was great about 10 mins from the subway station and right by hyde park. The room was average size as was the bathroom but both were really clean. I shared the bathroom with two other rooms but I never saw the other people so it worked out great. The breakfast is pretty good better than average only because you can have eggs, bacon and sausage.Overall this hotel was great as was the price"
45,606,"May 23 2008 	Great value	Stayed for 6 nights in a &quot;Superior room&quot;. The room was large and newly refurbished, very clean and lovely beds, also with 26&quot; flatscreen-tv and coffemaker. Very quiet room facing the rear. Tiny bathrooms but everything was new and clean. Very friendly staff indeed, and lovely breakfast. Check-in from noon is a plus.The location is perfect for sightseeing in London. No less than 3 tube-stations just minutes away, and 2 minutes to Hyde Park.Very recommended, and will come back again."
46,606,"May 2 2008	cheap rates but very noisy	this hotel is currently undergoing renovations, so may improve when renovations completed. I chose this hotel because it appeared to be located on a quiet side street and because of the proximity to Paddington Station. our room was located on the 3rd floor in the front of the hotel, and was very noisy both from noise outside the hotel, as well as the room above us and adjacent rooms ( due to very thin walls) The floor boards creaked loudly overhead as people were moving about at 5 A.M....very annoying as this lasted over 30 minutes. the room lacked decor, and it felt like we were staying in a box. The bed covers were stained, and carpeting had not been cleaned thoroughly. the bed sheets were clean, and fresh clean towels were provided daily during our stay. the bed was comfortable. The room also had an unpleasant odor and was very stuffy. we had to sleep with the window open. Breakfast was very good - full English breakfast cooked to order as well as a good selection of cold cereals and juices. this is an inexpensive hotel by London standards... you might do well if you ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Walk from Paddington Station takes about 15 minutes . We didn't have any trouble finding the hotel using directions from google map quest."
47,606,"Apr 17 2008 	Great place to stay if decor is not the most important thing to you	This hotel is highly recommended for those who yearn for a classic English breakfast, made to order as you arrive, and with great service. The neighborhood is quiet with lovely classic architecture, good for a stroll. And it's close to main tube and bus lines - you'll have a nice view on the famous Hyde Park every day. As for the hotel itself, service is good and rooms are clean, but there is no elevator, and the room we stayed in on the 4th floor was questionably decorated. However, they are remodeling all the rooms, and just a peek at rooms under construction reveals whitewashed walls with cream trim and tiled bathrooms with all new fixtures. And the breakfast room is quite acceptable already.In short, if you're the type of traveler who doesn't need a &quot;home base&quot; to come back to frequently during the day, you'll be too tired from exploring London to worry about the aesthetics of the rooms. But you'll be glad to start your day with a wonderful meal and a stroll through a nice neighborhood."
48,606,"Apr 8 2008	Hmmmm	Hmmm,What I look for in a hotel when I'm on business is something:- clean- secure- quiet enough to sleep- with free wi-fi in the rooms- with breakfast included- Well rated by TripadvisorAs cheap as possible. Usually, location's important too.The Caring hotel passes all of these fairly well. Here are the negatives:- I didn't like the fact that the mini soaps in my room had been previously used by another guest - I thought that was gross. - Also, the wifi was unsecured and judging by the speeds I got, half the neighbourhood is using it. It's easy to lock it down &amp; give the guests a simple password.- Finally I had to carry my heavy case up 4 flights of stairs. So it's fine, and I guess good value by London prices (I paid 49 for a room without a toilet) but not excellent at meeting my needs.Will I be back? Yes, if I don't find anything that looks better."
49,606,"Feb 11 2008 	Friendly convenient affordable	My friend and I stayed at the Caring Hotel for 4 nights in Feb 08. We found the place after walking around the neighborhood and visiting several hotels. (We started our trip at a hotel provided by the airline.) The staff at Caring Hotel showed us an available room and quoted us a good price - about $140/night for two single beds, which was one of the best prices we found. We were also told that we could check in early in the morning the next day so that we could drop our luggage off and spend the rest of our day out and about. The next day, when we checked in, we were offered a bigger and better room than the one we had reserved (for the same rate), which we gladly accepted. Service at the hotel was superb. The staff at front desk and for breakfast were always friendly and accommodating. We came back from long days of touristy activities to a clean room. An English breakfast is included in the room rate. It was a bit on the greasy side, but it was big and filling, and helped us to get through most days without a lunch (so as to save our money for dinner).The hotel is in the process of upgrading. Both of the rooms that we saw had brand new bathrooms with new tub, toilet and fixtures. The bed sheets were clean and starched. The carpets were a bit old and the heat was always on high in our room, but we didn't find them to be big problems.The location of the hotel is also really great. It's a 10-minute walk to Paddington train station, which we used to get to/from Heathrow airport. It's also a 10-minute walk to 2 different tube stations on central lines. There are a lot of cute shops and restaurants on the street near the tube stations. It's in a mix hotel/residential area so it's quiet. We walked and always felt safe, even at night.Overall, we were very pleased with the Caring Hotel, especially for the price and location. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
50,606,"Feb 10 2008 	Creaky Floorboards	My partner and I stayed here in December. The location was excellent, but what a night! We couldn't sleep due to the creaking floorboards from the room above us! It was so loud.The room was a bit claustrophobic and the breakfast was mediocre."
51,606,"Feb 3 2008 	Good Basic Hotel with friendly staff	I stayed at the Caring Hotel for 10 days. I had a good time and the price can't be beat (40 pounds a night, 36 pounds with a long stay discount). I had a shared single, which meant the bathroom was in the hall and shared with other guests on the floor. On my floor, there were two bathrooms (one with shower) for four rooms, so there was never a wait at all. The room was your basic room with a sink. For whatever reason, my single had two beds, which meant I slept in one and put my suitcases on the other, so I had plenty of room. There is free wireless internet in the lobby. Good for a quick check of email. The staff is the real plus of Caring Hotel. They were very friendly and responsive. My room was on the 4th floor and as with many smaller hotels, there was no elevator. Alex, the front desk guy during the day(manager?) offered to carry the heavier of my bags up which was very nice. He also was happy to recommend places to eat, a good cheap nearby laundromat for my clothes, and about anything else. I ordered a wake up call and taxi on my last day and both came on time. Minor trouble with phone in room (needed to be switched on) and one of the toilets (didn't flush properly) were quickly fixed by visit to front desk. There is 24 hr reception, so you can stay out as late as you like. The night desk guys are good too. The Czech guy is very friendly and I enjoyed talking with him. I only had the breakfast once, but it was good. Choice of continental or full (eggs, sausage bacon, beans). The room was always clean when I returned from a busy day of sightseeing with fresh towels. One day I ran into the house keeper when I got a late start at 11AM. It's in Paddington, which was a safe area, and a couple blocks away from either Paddington or Queensway Tube stations, from which you can get anywhere in London. Overall, you really couldn't do better than the Caring Hotel for the price you are offering."
52,606,"Jan 11 2008	Fair price for what you get	Excellent location, so-so hotel. No lift to carry your luggage upstairs (and the staff didn't even offer to give me a hand although I was on my own and had two huge suitcases). Rooms relatively clean but really depressing, with improbable wall paper and electric wiring back from the 70's. Cherry on top: the tap in the bathroom the kept trickling all night.If you are on a budget it is probably ok though. Breakfast included."
53,606,"Dec 12 2007 	Small and a bit dirty..	I usually don't mind small hotel rooms as I don't usually spend much time there except for sleeping, but this room was about 4 square moters, and that includes the 1 square metre that was the bathroom. I was glad we only had one suitcase-there would not have been space on the floor for more... Tv was a very small one with only 3 channels, but who's on holiday to watch tv anyway.. Dusty and not very clean room, the blankets on the bed should have been washed and there was so much dust on the closet we could not store things on top of it.(which would have been nice considering the small room)Did not try the breakfast as it ended at 9-to early for me- but I was waken every morning by the smell of fried bacon, and our roon was on the second floor and the breakfast room was in the basement. I can only imagine how it would smell in the breakfast room itself..Nice staff who could answer the few questions I had, and great location in Bayswater with restaurants and the underground nearby, and a very quiet street. Hotels in London are usually expensive and of a lower standard than you would expect, so for the price we paid this hotel was ok. The hotel had gotten really nice feedbacks on venere.com, thats why we chose it, but I would not give that positive feedback, and I would not stay there again."
54,606,"Nov 24 2007 	Great hotel with cheap prices	We have just returned from London where we went to see a football game (England-Croatia). We stayed in hotel Caring for 3 nights. The hotel is about 6-7 minutes walk from Paddington underground station or 2 minute walk from Bayswater bus stop (it's very close to city centre). The taxi to Victoria rail station costs only 13 ponuds! We booked in advance a triple room with private bathroom. The room was quite big with comfortable beds and the bathroom was new and very clean. The rate was really good, only 84 ponuds a night. Considering the breakfast, it was English each day (eggs, sausage and bacon along with toast, cereals and juice). Staff was very kind and helpful. We can recommend you this hotel."
55,606,"Sep 25 2007 	Great hotel for the price	Caring Hotel is easy to find, and a brisk walk from Tube and bus stops. We booked a double with shared bath. The room was small, and not the most comfortable of beds, but we never had any trouble waiting for the bath. We booked pretty far ahead of time and got a really good rate (47 pounds a night.) Considering how expensive everything in London is, especially against the weak dollar, this hotel was definitely great for the money. The neighborhood is pretty quiet at night, the rooms are clean, and the staff super friendly and helpful. Plus, the breakfast is cooked to order for you each morning and really filling. I'd recommend this hotel for those who want a clean room at a decent price, and are just looking for a place to sleep after a long day of sight seeing."
56,606,"Sep 22 2007	Nice accomodation in a quiet neighborhood	I read the reviews before booking and decided that this was the best hotel for the price. It is a 10 minute walk from Paddington, but get a cab if you are hauling alot of luggage. We booked a room with shared bath and two twin beds. The room was small but comfortable, although one mattress was worn to the springs. The room and bath were clean and no problems with scheduling use of the bath with others. The stairs can be a real obstacle, especially if you are not in good shape. The advantage of having a room on the upper floor is you do not hear the creaking wood floors above you. Breakfast is great with eggs and meats along with rolls, toast cereal and juice. If everything was perfect at the Caring, I am certain the price would be double what it is currently. We were comfortable, well fed and well rested during our three night stay. Great staff."
57,606,"Aug 27 2007 	OK I guess for people on a budget with not regards of quality	Service wise it was good. The staff was great, very helpful and extremely nice. The exterior of the hotel was also very pretty and the neighborhood is also beautiful. 10-minute (fast) walking distance from Paddington station. The room we had was very spacious and clean but very, very bad looking. Old, outdated and outdated looking. I guess you get what you pay for. And for the prices of London it was good. It even included breakfast.Again, you get what you pay for."
58,606,"Aug 23 2007	The Caring Hotel was Average not horrid but not great	We stayed at the hotel for three nights. That was more than enough. The room was large, but we had the bottom floor. Which means below street level. You can hear all the thumping from the rooms above. There is no elevator and the staircase is NARROW--which is a challenge with a big suitcase. It had a private bathroom. It was fine, but the ceiling was moldy. The shower was small--fine for us, but for someone of &quot;size&quot; it might not do. Like most European hotels, the beds were small and the double bed had a DEEP crease in the center, so that my husband and I both fell towards the center.The staff was VERY nice. The 'English' breakfast was fine. They also had toast and cereals and they had the best coffee that I had while in England. It is close to Paddington, Hyde Park, markets and mall shopping. I don't know if I would stay there again, it was $530 US dollars for 3 nights---I found that to be a bit steep.So...I give it an average grade."
59,606,"Jun 27 2007 	Convenient and clean...	Not easy to find coming from Paddington tube.We enjoyed the hotel's location and staff. Climbing up to the third floor with heavy suitcases wasn't a lot of fun, but the price was right and we needed the exercise after sitting on a plane for 7 hours! The breakfast was good, and they have tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms. We will be back..."
60,606,"Jun 19 2007 	Great for the price	Great location, very close to Hyde park in nice part of town.I've stayed at loads of different hotels near Paddington for around the same price (64 for a double room) and this is by far the best, in terms of quality of room, size of room, standard of staff."
61,606,"Apr 14 2007 	A little pricey but great for London	We stayed at the Caring Hotel last April, and had a very pleasant experience. The pros: excellent location close to the Underground, buses, restaurants and Kensington Gardens; great full, hot English breakfast; friendly and helpful staff; clean rooms. The cons: the smell of fried eggs and sausage rising through the thin walls; the dodgy locks on the room door; the shower which leaked a bit and was not very big; the poor television reception (we hardly watched TV though, since we were in London!); a bit pricey for what you get, I thought, but compared to other places I searched in London this was a good value."
62,606,"Jan 15 2007 	nice but noisy	the staff of the caring hotel was really friendly and helpful, the breakfast was quite good and tasty.We had a small room but quite cleaned and had to share the bathroom with two other rooms.The problem of this hotel is that it is quite noisy, certainly because of the wood floor. We could hear each step made by the persons on the room next to our. Some rooms are really to close to the others. I will recommend you to stay in this hotel but in a bigger room with en-suite.However this hotel is a good deal and specially cause of the area, just in front of hyde park and 20 mns by walk to main shops like Harrods."
63,606,"Jan 8 2007 	Old hotel with good location but..	Caring is a old hotel. They should have renovated it. The rooms are very simply decorated, with old furniture and a hard/noisy bed. The hotel is not soundproof, if you understand.. You can smell the bacon all over the hotel when you wake up.Good location, we paid a nice price and bathroom was small but ok."
64,606,Oct 28 2006 	Wonderful Reception	We stayed here for one night before leaving England for home. The location was excellent - close to the subway and to the larger Paddington station. We were greeted at reception by very friendly staff who offered to carry our bags up the 5 flights of stairs (no elevator). The room was a bit &quot;tired&quot; - the cover on the bed was old and worn. The breakfast wasn't the traditional English breakfast (no tomato or beans) - and although it was good the service was a bit lacking. I stayed at the Alhambra Hotel earlier in the month for the same price and preferred that spot for the newer furnishings in the rooms and the breakfast.
65,606,"Oct 5 2006 	Great Location!	Good hotel for the price. Wow was it cheap for London, and London is not cheap. The room itself isn't the greatest, but you can't beat the location. Just a couple blocks away from Hyde Park (beautiful park to hang out or exercise in) and even closer to the bus stop. Plenty of great food around the corner as well.The staff at the hotel (at least the 2-3 I encountered) were extremely pleasant and helpful."
66,606,Sep 5 2006	Nice place for price	Stayed for two nights in September in a room with shared bathroom. Room was small but typical for British standards. Everything was very clean including the bathroom and housekeeping did a good job everyday. Breakfast was cooked to order which was a nice touch for such a cheap rate. The people at the front desk were some of the friendliest we've met in a long time. Only complaint was that the hotel is very old and everything is well worn. Floorboards creaked very loudly with every step and even woke my husband up.
67,606,"Jul 7 2006	Nice little place to stay	The room was small, private bathroom was small--British standard. Daily towels, running hot water, clean room, and working TV. There are nearby internet cafes (one opens 24hrs) restaurants and small grocery stores. Pretty close to Queensway and Baywater tube--about 5-7 min walk. B&amp;B is on a small quiet street away from traffic and noises. Hyde park is 3 min walk, great for morning jogs. There is no air conditioning. I stayed in July, it was 85 degrees in the daytime. It was warm at night but not too warm that it's too uncomfortable to sleep. The two big windows helped. No in-room refrigerator. Breakfast was excellent...eggs, ham, sausage, fruit, cereal, coffee, milk, toast, jam and juice. Friendly staff, front desk opens 24 hrs. Overall, nice value for budget travelers."
68,606,"Jul 6 2006 	Nice place nice people	I stayed in the Hotel Caring for 3 days in June 2006. It's very well located in a pleasant, quiet street very near Hyde Park. The room was small but clean. I had a tiny little bathroom that served my needs adequately. The price was unbeatable at 40 per night - this included breakfast (which was standard fare for a budget hotel - not gourmet!). The staff were very friendly, good-humoured and helpful. This hotel lives up to its name! I'll definitely return to the Caring Hotel."
69,606,"Jun 10 2006	excellent in this rate	I like this small hotel, since it is clean and have delicious breakfast. Especially after you have too many continental breakfast. And my room have not any leak problem. their stuff also friedly and helpfully. I will stay in this hotel agin when I travel London again."
70,606,"Jun 6 2006	Great place	My wife and I stayed at the Caring for 5 days. We loved the area and the quiet street it was on. We had a suite with our own bathroom which was probably bigger than other rooms (we looked at their shared bathroom facilities and they were fine). It was very comfortable as hotels go and the service was good. The staff was friendly and also helpful in helping us get around in London (although, you're never that far away from convenient public transportation). It is a bit far from places that we wanted to go, but the trade off is the nice neighborhood. It is three blocks from Kensington park which was great for walking in the morning. BTW, the breakfast was good, too. I would certainly recommend the hotel for anyone wanting a great deal for a good place to stay. Say hello to Rashid. Good guy."
71,606,"May 11 2006	Great for the price	We stayed in a double (room 21) for four nights in May and were satisfied. Alhough the room was quite small and so was the bathroom, but it was cleaned every day, also new towels were provided every day. The windows were looking to the yard. The bed was good, soft mattress, but didn't like the pillow which was flat (this is the case almost in every hotel I stay, so maybe that is only my problem). There was electrical kettle for coffe making in the room.Hotel was small. There were guests in the room nex to ours but didn't hear any sounds, so it was also quiet. We did not much bother the staff, as far as we contacted the, they were friendly to us :)The full English breakfast was good, but on the forth day it was quite boring to have again bacon, sausage, eggs. But it filled us for the day anyway.As I already said we were satisfied because the price was good for things we got."
72,606,Mar 4 2006	Excellent	I stayed at this hotel for six nights and was nothing but pleased. very large rooms considering that this is europe and other rooms i've stayed in have been the siza of a closet. staff very friendly and helpful. cozy atmosphere. great english breakfast with many selections. five mins walk from paddington's station. would definitely come again on next trip. recommend highly.
73,606,"Dec 21 2005	Very inexpensive great breakfast...a bit ""aged""...	My fiance and I stayed in this hotel in August '05. Was a bit far from most attractions, but not so far as to make it a bad spot, considering the price. I don't believe there was any A/C, it was very small and could use some remodeling. However, it was about the cheapest thing you could find in London...in a safe area...and the breakfast was great, fast, and free. I would stay there again if my budget was as constricted as it was at the time."
74,606,"Oct 30 2005	Great Value	We stayed at the Caring for 6 nights in October 2005. Quiet zone and central location (5 minutes to Hyde Park). Very nice staff. The room with bathroom was clean and comfortable. We had our bath towels changed every day. English breakfast was really good, and included in price. All for 52 per night for the double room. It will be our first choice for the next time in London."
75,606,"Sep 22 2005	Caring 	Comfy and friendly hotel. A bargain considering how central it is to everything. We had the family room downstairs, with bathroom, cable tv, bath/shower, teac/coffee etc. Decor is late eighties clean but a bit tired...however what more could you want for 50 quid!Buses to everywhere are only 100m walk, 3 tubes close by as well as Paddington Station, Queensway restaurants and supermarkets, not to mention Portobello Rd markets a 5 min walk.Staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially with bus connections and tourist advice. Breakfast included, grumpy women but the food was good!Would definitely stay there again for the price."
76,606,"Aug 23 2005	Great Neighborhood	Well, you get what you pay for, but I suppose we were pretty content with the Caring. If there hadn't been a crazy heat wave that struck England when we went it would have been a lot more pleasant. As it was it was beastly hot, with no A/C or fans in the room and no breeze at all. My boyfriend hardly slept at all and wound up getting sick. But, this is not the fault of the poor hotel at all, and a very unusual situation.On the plus side, the hotel is within very easy walking distance of Paddington Station provided your luggage has wheels. There are innumerable pubs and restaurants in the area, both in the few blocks between the Caring and Paddington Station, and also a 15 minute walk away on Queensway Road. Queensway is a bustling street and is fun to just stroll up and down people watching or window shopping. The staff was also great about making suggestions for places to eat and was very friendly in general. Speaking of eating, the breakfast at the Caring Hotel was terrific. It's quite large and filling. I read another review that suggested getting to the breakfast just when they opened, and although it's true that latecomers did have to wait a bit to eat I felt as if they were a little slow in getting their act together in the morning. There was actually quite a scene with a number of elderly French women who needed milk for their coffee and could not drink it black. It was apparently not the time for the setting out of the milk yet, however, and the staff hid in the kitchen while the poor women wandered about. Somehow i had procured a pitcher of milk by arriving first in the morning and shared it with them, avoiding a melt-down, but it reminded me of Eastern European rationing. But the full English breakfast was great and there was cereal and fruit and a selection of juices too.As for the bathrooms, the ones in the rooms are useless and not worth paying extra for. The hall bathrooms were very useable though and had good pressure. There was never a wait for the shared bathroom either, so I ignored our in room shower after a disastrous attempt at bathing there and used the hall one.Thee rooms could have been cleaner and are well-worn, but I didn't see any bugs.All in all, a good budget hotel. Reasonably hospitable, cheap and in a great location."
77,606,"Jul 2 2005	Leaky Leaky...you'll get wet in your room	The hotel was not that bad, but it leaked and was very loud. The staff was nice, but it did not make up for the poor sleep or problem with the ceiling. We had 3 areas that were leaking water on us in a large amount. We told the staff right away and they said we had to wait for the handy man and we finally got to move rooms. The problem was that they did not have a room for us the next night and we had to check out because our room was leaking. The next room was so loud from the people walking above us that it woke us up at night. The hotel is old and has a lot of physical problems in the rooms. You get what you pay for in the room quality."
78,606,"Apr 4 2005	Good Cheap Hotel	Stayed in January for 3 nights. Long walk up about 4 or 5 flights to top floor, but (single) room was basic and clean -- reasonable (shared) bathroom. Small room, with sink in room, which I appreciated. I was at the bottom end of the price range for this hotel. It felt very much like a college dorm room (see photos). Staff friendly, breakfast fine.Good area -- about a 10 minute walk to 2 tube lines. Cheap email access and loads of restaurants along nearby Bayswater Rd.For the price, definitely worth it. Not the kind of hotel you want to spend a lot of time in, but a good place to crash."
79,606,"Feb 16 2005	Disappointed	Desk clerks were very cheery and helpful. An excellent rating there. The full English breakfast was tasty although slightly minimalist. The problems were in the room itself. Poor water pressure in the shower and an exhaust vent in the bathroom with dust caked on a quarter of an inch thick. The only way to regulate the temperature in the room was to open the window up 12 inches. Two hot water pipes running floor to ceiling in one corner of the room, with no control, radiated constant heat, day and night. The actual radiator for heating the room stayed stone cold. A large dark stain across the carpet and I swear you could not take a step in the hotel room without the floor creaking loudly. Walking about in the room required ear plugs. It was room number 8. Even at 62 pounds per night, I feel we were short changed."
80,606,"Dec 15 2004	Nice area.. not bad.	Clean, tiny room, but that's pretty much what you're going to get in this price range. Great area and location. Helpful staff. Decent breakfast. Would stay again for short time."
81,606,"Nov 26 2004	Value for money	Considering the central location with quiet surroundings I recommend this place for a short stay. The rooms vary (we have stayed here twice with family and friends, two rooms once and three rooms second stay). As usual i central London, plumbing is not the strenght of the hotel. Low prices, nice staff and full english breakfast included makes this the perfect place to stay if you just want a place to sleep and shower. If you want a nice bar and reception area just move a block away and stay at Mornington (at twice the price). For a weekend in London where you spend your money on a theatre or musical ticket instead, Caring Hotel is the perfect choice."

1,609,"Nov 18 2009 	Nice price nice location and great service	6 danish women went for 4 days of shopping i London and stayed at the Castleton hotel. It was an incredible nice stay. The rooms were perfekt, nice and clean - and the staff was so friendly and helpful. The costs were low. We definently consider comming back. The breakfast was typical english."
2,609,"Nov 9 2009 	Well worth a stay for the price cracking location	After reading numerous reviews on tripadvisor for the Castleton Hotel I decided to book for one evening prior to a flight from Heathrow the next day. On arrival I was greeted by a friendly gentlemen on reception and promptly booked in and guided to my room. The place although clean appeared to be a little old fashioned. Thankfully a lift has been fitted which appeared to be fairly new, useful considering I was a few floors up and had a large suitcase.I'd booked a single room and was glad to find the room I was allocated was in-fact a double room en suite. The room was a good size, it had recently been refurbished nicely with a lcd freeview tv on the wall and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was very small, one of those self contained units you sometimes get in B&amp;B's fine for a quick shower and not much else.I had a decent nights sleep, no noise issues apart from guest noise that you would expect.Breakfast in the morning was much better than expected, full English was good but was not a proper full english just Bacon, Sausage, Egg &amp; Beans. The staff were very attentive and certainly were not discourteous which is what I normally find in London Hotels!Overall for the price I thought the Castleton was great, a little quirky but clean, good staff and decent breakfast. Well worth booking yourself in for a day or two, probably best suited for the solo traveller."
3,609,"Oct 30 2009 	Outstanding Value for Money	A few days before our trip to London I read that although tourism to England was down by 5% income from tourism was down only 1%. I can believe it because for anyone on dollars it is really really expensive!As Hotels are a major expense we had a very hard time finding something within the budget of a family of five but really lucked out be finding the Castleton a few steps from Paddington Station. Despite it being the cheapest place we found it left very little to be desired. While generally European hotel rooms are small by American standards the Castleton has a variety of room sizes. If you get there and are not satisfied we observed the hotel staff graciously changing a couples room to one that was larger.Besides the room being clean, adequate in size, relatively cheap, breakfasts reasonable and the hotel being in an amazingly convenient location the staff is an additional reason for choosing the Castleton. Weve paid much more money for hotels and not encountered the caring and helpfulness given us by at least 5 different desk personnel. This doesnt mean that all had the same level of computer skills to help us with the Internet etc. but they all tried very hard to make our stay pleasurable.For example, waiting for our children to meet us in the lobby for our departure to Heathrow we were informed that they had hit a transportation problem and we wouldnt be getting to the airport as early as we had hoped. On hearing this and seeing the anxious look on my wifes face, the desk clerk, Ahmer (who had previously explained the cheapest way to get us to Heathrow) asked if we had e-tickets. When we said yes, within minutes he presented us with our boarding passes which meant we would have a much speedier check-in.Some tips: stay away from most of the restaurants between the Station and the hotel. Ask the staff where to eat around the hotel. Second London has become a transportation disaster. We had 5 various diversions which included getting on the tube and hearing the announcement that the station we wanted was closed! Buy the Oyster card  definitely cheapest way to travel and learn how to use the busses  while maybe not faster they sometimes were much more convenient and are cheaper than the tube.To sum up the Castleton Hotel  outstanding value for money."
4,609,"Oct 12 2009 	What a bargain in London!	I would give this hotel a 5 star review. I don't understand the lower ratings. I spent 6 nights at this hotel the last week of September. First of all, it is within walking distance from Paddington Rail (Heathrow Express) and Underground Stations. The room with a private bath was big enough and the bathroom was spotless. The English breakfast every morning was amazing and the service very friendly and helpful in the restaurant. The fellows at the front desk were VERY helpful and cordial to all. I would go back in a nanosecond. My rate was about $90 US dollars a night. You can't stay at the YMCA for that and they don't include a full breakfast. I have been to London 6 times over the years and this is one of the nicest if not the nicest place I have stayed. I have paid much more but this hotel far surpassed the more expensive ones. Ask for a room at the back--it was very quiet!I would recommend this hotel and know you would enjoy your stay. During my stay everything worked and I had absolutely no problems. Give it a try!"
5,609,Oct 12 2009 	Lost it a bit	This was my second stay at the Castleton and the way they have now done the bathrooms has lost it for me. They are just too small for comfort. Tiny towels too. The dining room is so cramped you can hardly move around and the food has deteriorated badly. We paid for full breakfast but they were short of bacon on one morning. Ho tomatoes or mushrooms on offer and horrid bread for the toast. Service was fine. Its clean enough (despite ongoing renovations)but prices elsewhere have come down and the Castleton is no longer the great value it once was
6,609,"Oct 9 2009 	Excellent stay	Truly pleased with our choice of this hotel. We arrived very, very early (630AM) and were checked into our room immediately. Room was very simple, but was clean, comfy and met our needs. AC did not work but was tolerably cool. LIft had been installed but was down 3 days. There was some noise from the pub across the street, but didn't really bother us much. The location was perfect, truly a two minute walk to Paddington Station. Lots of food choices &amp; travelers supplies in one block. Breakfast was yummy, including cereal, juice, toast and full English breakfast, served in a lovely room by very nice staff. Desk staff was very helpful and even helped us figure out how to get from Wimbledon to Hampton Court via public transport, as I didn't have a computer. A cousin came to visit us and they were gracious to her and provided her with parking. One poor man even came up to our room and killed a wasp that had flown into our room. Now THATS excellent service!"
7,609,"Oct 9 2009 	Great Place Great Value	great breakfast, flat screen TV, individually controlled AC, large modern lift, clean modern compact bathroom, nice toiletries, short three block walk to Paddington Station"
8,609,"Sep 29 2009	very clean	We stayed for two days and were very impressed with the location. They were obviously in the middle of some updates/renos but were very tidy about it. Our room was clean and the bathroom was very clean. The only downfall was there wasn't wifi, but there was internet access in the lobby. The front desk man informed us that they were planning on having wifi within the month. The breakfast was good, served hot and quick. I would imagine it would get tiring after a while but for a couple of days it was a great way to start the day. We would definatly stay there again."
9,609,"Aug 16 2009 	staff and breakfast were good the room was less than expected	The staff and breakfast were very good at the Castleton, and the location was good. The room we had was not particularly clean, was very worn and there was mold in the bathroom."
10,609,"Aug 14 2009 	Good Hotel to Visit London	My stay at the castleton hotel was very nice. The double Room was small, but for only two persons was perfect. The room and the bathroom very clean and confortable, they cleaned the hotel all the days.We arrived at the hotel 3 hours before the check in and we left our lugage at the reception, we went to the city and then we was returned at the hotel and they gave us our room at 13.00 pm.All the 7 days the room was clean and they changed the towels all days. The room had one double bed, one closet, one table with two chairs and a TV screen wich had 5 chanels (all in english). The bathroom had a wc, washbasin and shower (They gave us shampoo, soap for the body and soap for the hands).The Staff was very nice and they didn't speak Spanish but they can understand us. The air conditioning didn't work (It was out of order) but in the room was a ventilator who was enough.The breakfast room had diferent tables and it near of the reception. The waitress was very nice and the breakfasts contained egg (scramble or fried), sausage, bacon, toast, hot chocolate or coffee or tea, cereals and orange juice.In resume, The Castleton Hotel is a very great place to stay in London. At only 3 minutes walking the Paddington tube and rail Station (circle, barkerloo, district and hammersmith and city lines) and 5 minutes walking to the Lancaster Gate tube station ( central line). The price is perfect and the room, staff and breakfast is great to stay only for some hours at the day (Bed and Breakfast). If I will return at London, I will stay at this hotel."
11,609,"Aug 10 2009 	Friendly welcoming helpful staff and great location	Traveling solo and out of Australia for the first time, I booked a few nights at the Castleton at the start of a three month holiday in England and Europe. Fantastic location, about a two minute walk from Paddington station (I had caught the train to Paddington from Heathrow Airport). Great location from which to explore London - Hyde Park a couple of minutes walk and access to everywhere either walking or via the Tube. Immediately felt very welcome. Staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful, providing me with London and Tube maps, suggesting places of interest, etc. Was always greeted by a friendly face each day and staff took time to chat about my sightseeing adventures. Full buffet breakfast, more than I could ever eat and very friendly and helpful kitchen staff. Very clean and comfortable room with double bed. On returning from Europe at the end of June I chose, without hesitation, to stay here for another few nights before returning to Australia. On my return I was greeted like an old friend and felt very at home. New rooms had been opened up on my return and a lift installed."
12,609,"Aug 6 2009 	Ownership changed!	In 2006 I stayed there and vowed not to return. However, my friends were staying there in June 2009 and I decided to give it another try. The same person was working at the front desk and welcomed me by name. He quickly explained to me that the old owners have moved on and that the new owners are installing a lift, and air conditioning/heating units in the rooms!!!A lot of improvements have been made and it is still one of the cheapest places to stay in London. Breakfast was excellent. The location is fantastic....Paddington Station a block away, good restaurants nearby. Definitely recommend it."
13,609,"Jul 27 2009 	Tiny room no elevator nor aircon	This hotel is nicely located, metro is about 400m away and you can walk to Hyde park and Marble Arch. There is a bus tourist company which drives just behind the corner. But nothing else can be recommended. Hotel is small and our room at the highest floor was smallest we have ever been to. It felt like the wall would fall on us. And because we were on top floor, of course there was no elevator working that time. Maybe it was under construction because there was some renovation going on at some other floors. Stairs were narrow too. Aircondition wasn`t working either. There was not much help of the small window. Room has been renewed lately, but it felt like beeing in a c-class cabin in cruise ship, unfortunately. Breakfast was so and so, some day they were out of some of their basic products. Staff was friendly both in reception and breakfast room.If you are interested in this hotel, make sure that aircon is working and you get bigger room than what we got. We wont go there again."
14,609,"Jul 25 2009	Great location and value	Arrived early and desk staff watched our luggage and placed it in the room for us while we went out. We had a med. sized ground floor room. Some noise due to the stairwell being right outside the door. An elevator is being put in off the lobby but was not yet operating. 24 hour desk service. Nice flat screen TV in the ,although furniture could have been improved, a lot of wasted space, the beds were comfortable. Compact but modern en-suite, Not that we needed it but a/c had an &quot;out of service&quot; sign glued to the control. One window would not shut all the way ,luckily it faced an unused courtyard. Friend in a basement room which faced the street had to complain about the noise and smokers on the sidewalk outside of the hotel in the early morning hours. Desk staff should have dealt with this as they knew the room was occupied. Great location for Paddington Station and various tube lines. Would certainly stay here again as it was a huge improvement over the B &amp; B, just around the corner, I stayed in during a prior visit to London."
15,609,Jul 9 2009 	breakfast was tops	cheep clean perfect location would stay there again and the breakfast was bloody good
16,609,"Jul 6 2009 	Basic but spotlessly clean!	I booked this hotel as a budget hotel for myself and a friend to say in when visiting London to take in Blur in Hyde Park (who were amazing!). Anyway, I was worried as it was one of the cheapest hotels I could find and I didn't know what to expect (rats, bed bugs, etc!). Anyway on arrival I was very pleasently surprised. The front desk staff were friendly and the room, on the first floor was small but clean. The room itself wasn't perfect, very small and the window latches were broken but it was very clean and big enough for a couple of nights. The bathroom was amazing, an all plastic pod, really tiny prebuilt self contained bathroom! But it was big enough to wash in and thats really all you need. My friend did complain about the noise level while we were staying, I slept through it but I am a really heavy sleeper and whenever anyone passed our door to go up or down stairs it was like they were in the room. However if you are just looking for a place to lie your head and can cope with wearing ear plugs then it's not anything to worry about. Finally breakfast.... errm this kinda let the hotel down. The food itself was fine however the first day we were served by a male staff member who was rude, he mumbled to one of us about what we wanted and then tried to run off after only taking one order. It was clear his english wasn't very good but even so, he didn't actually try much. He then brought the wrong food, then when we asked for the correct food he still brought the wrong thing. Without one apology. The second day however we got a normal person who was actual good at there job and all was better! I thought the bad waiter was very, very funny! Extremely Faulty Towers, however those with less of a sense of humour may not have been amused! Anyway, overall it was great value for money, the food was decent and like I have said it was spotlessly clean and the desk staff were helpful and friendly. If you want some place cheap in the centre of London then I think you'd struggle to beat this."
17,609,"Jul 1 2009 	Pleasant experience	We stayed for two nights. Received a very friendly welcome the ensuite bedroom was compact (who goes to london to spend time in their room?? )but spotless, comfortable bed, tea &amp; coffee and colour tv, also a balcony which was a nice surprise. The breakfast was very good and freshly cooked. We thought it was a very pleasant change from the souless and expensive chain hotels we have used. and only 2 minutes walk from Paddington. Hyde Park is also very close by.We would definately stay here again Thankyou to the staff of Castleton Hotel."
18,609,"Jun 30 2009 	good location and friendly front desk	Very convenient in distance to Paddington Station, in about 5 minute by walk. A couple of parking spaces available, seemingly with a reasonable overnight charge. British breakfast. Our room is clean but small and noisy, but not sure whether other rooms are the same. The front dest on the second night was very friendly and helpful. We checked out and left the lugguges at his deposit until we picked them up in the afternoon."
19,609,"Jun 8 2009 	fantastic value and unbeatable service!	this was our second stay at the castleton hotel and yet again the service we had was fantastic,i dont think you could get more helpful friendly staff,the location is superb and the rooms are always immaculate,thanks once again for a fantastic stay."
20,609,"May 12 2009 	Great Stay	Very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast included: eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, toast, cereal. Rooms small but clean. No elevator, we lucked out and got room on 1st. floor. Close to Paddington station, some resturants and convience stores in area. Very good for the price. Construction going on at hotel but during the day, didn't bother us."
21,609,"May 6 2009 	Bed not delivered	Upon arrival, I was told that we could not stay in the hotel due to delay on the arrival of room furniture =bed. The Castleton hotel staff was very polite.We were offered to :- stay in a different hotel of the same category - have breakfast at the Castleton or at the other hotel.The arrangement we got was disappointing the first room we were offered was in the basement no shower, no window and dirty. The second room we were offered was also in the basement, but with a shower cabin in the room, a window to a laundry corner. We were told that as we were not this hotel guests that the best they could offer us.We did enjoy the English breakfast from the Castleton hotel.Hopefully the Castleton hotel is all refurnised by now."
22,609,"Apr 30 2009 	great reasonable rooms perfect location	i stayed four nights here and enjoyed every minute of it. coming from the new york area, small rooms don't really bug me, but those of you who need more space may feel a bit cramped.the bathroom was TINY, but usable and was the only real drawback to the room. rates are reasonable, the staff are all EXTREMELY helpful, and the location CANNOT be beat for tourism in london. it's one block from the Paddington tube station which will get you to every major area of the city in about 10-30 minutes.the building is undergoing some renovation so the internet isn't working in all the rooms but it will be, soon.absolutely will recommend this place to anyone and everyone i know who is travelling to london"
23,609,"Apr 1 2009 	Nice stay	Stayed for 7 nights in a twin room. The room was very small and the bath extremely tiny, but it is London &amp; I was expecting this. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Very close to Paddington Station. This made sight-seeing a breeze! The breakfast was adequate. Good size portions, just no variety. After 4 days we got tired of the samething every morning. Construction going on while we were there but they only worked from about 8-5 and we were usually not at the hotel at this time anyways, so it did not bother us. I would not hesitate to stay here again!"
24,609,"Mar 27 2009 	quaint	I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in March. It was a great stay. It is a 2 minute walk to Paddington tube station and is right next to many restaurants and an internet cafe. it is a quiet neighborhood but it is london, you take the tube everywhere anyways. The room was nice but there was no elevator (but they were putting one in when we were there). I enjoyed my stay here."
25,609,"Feb 19 2009 	Was well impressed	Location: Tres convenient. Near all the sights (Notting Hill, Picadilly Circus, bla bla bla) without actually being IN the circus. Couple of tube stops away from the hoopla. 6-8 in a taxi. Reception staff: great. Friendly, polite, professional, helpful and full of those wee tips which are so handy for the hapless tourist. Building: some building-work going on whilst we were there (installatiion of a lift.) Commenced about 9 am. Lovely building. Not unique though, (probably about 100 hotels in this street in the same vein with similar decor/layout.) Room: wonderful. We were impressed; better than we expected. Modern yet with a couple of nods to times gone by; compact but extremely fuctional bathroom, kettle, hair dryer, TV, etc. Breakfast: Cereal, then sausage, eggs, bacon, beans and toast.Very tasty. Moans: annoying pigens cooing and bleating ouside room from about 7am. Could hear stomping footsteps from fellow guests very clearly which was also annoying. Like, keep it down people.However this was nothing to do with this hotel in particular. All in all, great value for money. Really liked it. Stay here."
26,609,"Jan 12 2009 	Quite satisfactory	I went to the Castleton in July last year. We were staying in one of the newly renovated rooms with a (small) new bathroom containing all necessities. London is an expensive hotel city and the Castleton is among the more reasonably priced places. - Close to the underground and within walking distance of Oxford Street. - It was clean and tidy, the staff is exceptional - funny and helpful. Only but is the breakfast - better sausages and bacon would be really nice. Definitely worth the expences."
27,609,"Jan 2 2009	Excellent value cozy little nest great location	We picked the Castleton based on reviews by other Trip Advisor readers. It was a good choice. My daughter and I were in room 404, up on the top floor, for the week after Christmas and it was lovely and cozy, with a window over the front street that we could open and close as we liked to change the temperature in the room. (Someone else has posted a photo of it - rust color walls, nice window, &quot;space station&quot; bathroom with plenty of hot water, flat-screen TV, tea making supplies...). The beds(we had twin beds) were comfortable with warm thick comforters - which we didn't really need as the room was nice and warm. It was very quiet, except when our neighbors came home late in the evening and had trouble with their door (I suspect they were a little too inebriated to get the key into the lock - there are no deadbolts, by the way, just normal bedroom door locks, which is a little unnerving, but access to the Hotel is limited so we felt safe enough). We could also hear newcomers as they wheezed their way to the final landing outside our door with their luggage. The Hotel is entirely non-smoking, which is a huge plus.The breakfast was made to order (ask for the scrambled eggs, and the English bacon is a delight), with all the toast, juice, cereal, tea, coffee, etc., you want. The Breakfast Room was a pleasant start to the day - breakfast is served 7 to 9:00am, so if you go in there at 7:00 it is almost empty and quite pleasant and you can linger a while.All the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, giving advice as to transportation routes and shopping destinations. This hotel is a very short distance from Paddington Station, with transportation from there to everywhere. (The #7 bus will take you directly to the British Museum along the High Street (shopper's paradise - Soylent Green Is People!), and the Circle Line Tube will take you directly to the Albert and Victoria, Natural History, and Kensington.) No matter where you are in the city, if you spot a bus going to Paddington it takes you home again. We ate a huge breakfast every day, had tea and scones at the V &amp; A museum for a late lunch twice and a good sandwich at the British Museum a few times (you need more than one day for that museum), and had supper near the hotel (either a pasty bought over at Paddington Train Station or a pizza) and so freed up money to take a last-day-there tour out to the ruins at Stonehenge/ Glastonbury/ Avesbury (Anderson Tours, picked up and dropped off at the Hotel door - excellent, inexpensive tour in a mini-bus). There's a Marks and Spencer and another grocery store (plus several other shops - including one that sells Paddington Bear items) at the station, so you can get items to eat in your room if you'd rather not deal with any of the many nearby restaurants. (Our room cleaner must wonder, as every morning there was an empty quart of milk and an empty box of cookies in the trash even if we ate out that night. We fought jet lag with late night TV and cookies and milk!) The only negatives, and they are ~barely~ negatives in my book, are: 1) there are no phones in the rooms so if you don't have a cell phone you have to rely on messages left for you at the desk (they are very nice about that) and use the public phone halfway down the block for outgoing calls; 2) there is no lift in the building - again, this is barely a negative, except for the first day when we had to haul our luggage up four flights of stairs after an entire day on airplanes, trains, and buses. By the end of our week's stay we were bounding up the stairs with no problems; 3) there are only 4 TV stations; and, 4) that you eventually do have to leave - we stayed a week and wish we were back there right now.I am torn as to posting this - it really is a wonderful little hotel. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a quiet, peaceful room. Still, I'd like to keep it a secret so we can always find a room there. We arrived a few hours before check-in, but the desk clerk went ahead and let us have the room early as we were about out on our feet and it was freezing cold outside. They really are very nice folks - incredibly warm and friendly, and the staff make the hotel what it is."
28,609,"Dec 15 2008 	The Castleton Hotel was great	Like so many ,we looked for a hotel with central location and affordable for a family. We found it and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast kept us going till midafternoon. Our room was pleasant and clean. Really good restaurants just down the street. Exactly what we wanted. Would stay there again."
29,609,"Dec 3 2008	Keep it a secret....	I have just returned from a four day stay at the Castleton Hotel London and it was great. One of the best value for money options in London. Location is great, only a three minute walk from Paddington, with many tube lines and especially practical for Heathrow Express, which leaves from there. The rooms are no ballrooms (but who would expect that in London for this price and in this type of building?). My friend and I stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms, which was lovely decorated and eqipped with a flat screen. I would recommend to request one of those when booking. The bathroom was indeed small, but functional and most importantly, the shower didn't only run drop-by-drop. The only small disadvantage we found was that all the lights in the room could only be switched on and off with one switch all at once. Maybe something can be done about that.... However one should consider that there is no elevator (again, not surprising in a former townhouse). Everything was very clean, staff was friendly and breakfast (which was included) was good and served in a half souterrain bright hall with antique chandeliers. Actually I'm stupid to share this experience with everyone, this will make future bookings even harder. We really loved our time there and my friend even booked herself in longer than planned, so I can really recommend it !!! But keep it to yourself....Gaby from Germany"
30,609,"Nov 14 2008 	Superb	I booked the hotel in rush at the time, as I wanted to surprise my wife with a weekend up town. We had an excellent time, a fantastic hotel, with huge character, and very friendly and helpful staff.Very cosy, very comfortable, I am looking forward to going back!."
31,609,"Nov 12 2008 	To Be Avoided	I booked this hotel on the basis of reviews on this web site and am here to report that the place shold be avoided like the plague.The staff are rude, the rooms are tiny, with hardly enough room to fit a bed in. The 'bathrooms' are comparable in size and fittings to a toilet that you would find on an aircraft. The place was so bad that my girlfriend burst into tears upon seeing the room, with its rust coloured walls. The hallways had exposed pipework and electrical cables hanging from the ceiling. The breakfast consisted of bitter coffe and warm orange juice. The sausage was filled with grissle and was dreadful. Other than a hotel room I had in the New York district of Queen's, this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and would urge all travellers to avoid."
32,609,"Nov 1 2008 	Clean and friendly	My daughter and I stayed for one night in October in a twin room and as always I like to get value for money. I feel that we got it. Decent sized room with very small funtional bathroom with shower, sink and toilet. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. There was a kettle with tea,coffee, sugar and milk sachets. Also a flat screen TV on the wall.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
33,609,"Oct 28 2008 	Good hotel near Paddington station	I stayed here for one night costing 50 using venere.com. I was in London for the NFL game at Wembley and wanted the convenience of staying somewhere close to Paddington station so getting back to the hotel after the game was easy, and I could travel back home easily on the monday morning.The hotel is one block away from Paddington, about a three or four minute walk, so its very close if you're looking for a decent place near the train station.I payed for a single room which was very small, but I wasn't too concerned as it was only a one night stay. The room was clean and had a LCD TV with sky television. Not being a big hotel, the rooms are quite close together, therefore expect to hear a lot of noise when people are going in and out of rooms, shutting doors and going up and down the stairs etc.For the price I paid and the reasons I chose this hotel though it was more than adequate and was a nice end to my weekend break."
34,609,"Oct 14 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	Hotel accommodation is notoriously expensive in London so I was looking for something economical but with acceptable standards. I found and booked the Castleton online, reading previous reviews before doing so. I was pleasantly surprised that the accommodation was much better than expected - my room was not small and included tea and coffee making facilities which I hadn't expected. The room was tastefully well furbished. The young man on reception was most helpful in assisting my journey planning for the following days. The young lady serving breakfast was extremely pleasant and attentive - the traditional full english breakfast was delicious and enough to set me up for the day. The chambermaid was friendly and did a really good service of my room in my absence. I stayed for 2 nights at the Castleton at the beginning of this month. The proximity of Paddington tube station to the hotel is a bonus - just a two minute walk. I will certainly be using this hotel again when next in London. Well done."
35,609,Sep 8 2008	Small but lovely	Had a great time in london staying at this very well located hotel.Staff were charming and even thougfh the room was small I had everything I needed.
36,609,"Sep 7 2008 	Superb a genuine surprise	I must admit I was nervous. My girlfriend and I were staying in London for the first time and took a gamble on the Castleton. We're glad we did. The hotel was small but superbly clean, the breakfast was decent and the waiting staff and receptionists were excellent. We were made very welcome, the room was well decorated and very clean and we were impressed with the whole stay. Well done, Castleton!"
37,609,"Aug 3 2008 	Excellent value for money	The Castleton hotel has an excellent location, very near the Padington tube station, with quite a few restaurants and bars within a walking distance. Tthe staff is very warm, kind and helpful. Our rooms were fitted with new bathrooms, and were a bit tiny but very clean. The breakfast was a full English breakfast plus some additions, and we have enjoyed it very much. Also, we were worried about the noise from the street, but it was not actually an issue. We stayed for a whole week and were absolutely satisfied."
38,609,"Jul 14 2008 	Good value basic hotel close to Wembley	We arrived on a Saturday morning - check in is at 11.30am which was really useful. Myself and 3 friends stayed in the quad room which consisted of 4 single beds, with a small living area and a bathroom (toilet,sink and shower). The room itself was clean and tidy and the beds were comfortable. There we no tea and coffee making facilities and the room was a little dark (we were downstairs in the basement - although we did have a window) but i didnt expect it to be perfect at the price we paid.The hotel is really close to paddington underground station and has a great selection of little pubs and restaurants in the surrounding area. The reason for our stay was a trip to Wembley Arena - the hotel is great for this purpose and is only a few stops away on the tube (about 30 minutes door to door). Breakfast the next morning was good - a small english breakfast (bacon, sausage, egg and beans) with unlimted tea/coffee and toastAll in all I would recommend this hotel if all you need is a no frills convienent good value place to stay."
39,609,"Jun 30 2008 	Value for money	I stayed at this hotel for two nights 27th and 28th june, Ive stayed in far worse places and i think this hotel is value for money. i agree the rooms were small and amenities could have been better,.but as a budget hotel.it came up over my expectations.All the staff were very friendly and polite and really made me feel at home.The breakfast was superb.just what you need before hitting the london sights.Only complaint i have is there was no coffee/tea making facilties which were certainly required."
40,609,"May 14 2008 	Below average for price	This is a fairly cheap hotel in a convenient location close to Paddington Station and OK for a short stopover, but it's let down on basics I would still expect, even at their price.Main issues were - no clothes hangers at all, no hand towels, no sink plug in shower room, TV aerial socket not working.Since we were only there for a night and spent little time in the hotel I didn't complain to the management but that many defects should have been picked up without prompting."
41,609,"Feb 24 2008 	great value	I think its the best choise for budget travelers like me . Excellent location , near Hyde park and tube . Very friendly staff and average breakfast . Yes the rooms are small , and no lift !!!but who stays all day in hotel ???"
42,609,"Jan 27 2008 	good basic hotel	plus points:very close to Paddingtonattentive, friendly staffsimple, clean room with (albeit small) en-suitegood, hearty breakfastquite handy for Hyde Parknegative: I stayed in winter, so it wasn't an issue but there's no ice making machine or air con no tea/coffee making facilities in room[but these are things you'd be hard pushed to find in any hotels in this price range]"
43,609,"Dec 15 2007 	Wonderful staff	Ohh! wat a great experience it was. Very convieniently located, and well managed place. rooms are not great but the price i paid was fare to me so cant complain. very clean and organised rooms.i head that the new owners just taken over and planning to refurbish so i lookforward to go there. Breakfast i had was so good that i havnt had sort of for about years.The reception staff specially Mark and Prashan wonderful people and very friendly, thats wat you want end of the day after tiring days to make u laugh wonderfully.i would reccommend to any one going there. Very nice place!!!"
44,609,"Nov 28 2007 	not bad- but not all that good either	the location of the place is fantastic - near both edgware road and paddington station. although its not an airport hotel in the true sense of the term, its very accessible to heathrow because of the rail connections from paddington (both heathrow xpress and heathrow connect). thats the reason i booked it. however, much to my surprise, there was no lift! we were given a room in the 3rd floor, which doesnt sound too bad, until you find out its up 6 flights of stairs!!! my bag was over 20kg. arriving and checking out when i had to go all the way back down again, were a nightmare! the hotel is actually a good one, but this sets it back a lot. they make an effort by putting toiletries in your bathroom, good level of cleanliness, etc. there was a restaurant that served breakfast but i was never awake early enough for it.... the people seemed nice enough and claim that they have done a lot of work to the place since they bought it over (new management recently). if you dont have a big bag or heavy luggage, i would recommend it for value-for-money accommodation in zone 1 in london, especially if you are travelling to or from heathrow."
45,609,"Aug 23 2007	Best Peopl	We love this hotel. Mr Fara and Jilla and the staff are friendly and helpful. Great location and price. Yes, the rooms are small and basic. Breakfast is good. Great location and safe. We have stayed here 4-5 times and will return."
46,609,"Dec 11 2006 	dirty and claims ignored	Dirty rooms, expecially the family one: almost impossible to get a shower. even in other rooms it is better to avoid to touch the shower tent.... black spotted. We claimed but with no result. Also, to be avoided 100%, don't give them your credit card nr. before your arrival... the 100% of the due amount will probably be debited immediately, and, if you claim. you just get back the 50% of it. bye"
47,609,"Nov 28 2006 	Freezing water and complaint ignored!	Stayed 1 night on 23rd Nov 2006. Very very basic at best. Next morning, water was freezing cold. Reception said there had been an overnight plumbing problem. Left a complaint and a message for the manager to call me but they never did."
48,609,"Nov 11 2006 	Very nice hotel	The hotel is very nice, clean and quite. Upon arrival we were given quite a bad room, but it was replaced with a great room with balcony as soon as we requested. The breakfast is an English one and not continental. The location is great - 2 min from the train/tube station. We realy enjoyed our stay."
49,609,"Jan 27 2005	just about ok for the price	The only saving grace is the very cheap rates available for these rooms.The rooms are small. Beds are small and uncomfortable/lumpy. We hardly had enough room to open up our bags.decor was manky pink with bargain basement furniture.en suite leaves a lot ot be desired, with a walk in shower (i.e. no shower door/curtain) that floods the entire (miniscule) bathroom, a toilet that didn't flush properly and the toilet also kept running all night making an annoying noise.breakfast was poor (beans and rubbery bacon) but included in the price.The hotel is also quite hot and stuffy, and there is no lift, so you may have to struggle up a few stairs.We stayed here just as a really cheap option when we went to a gig in Hyde Park. It is ok but only as a place to rest your head for the night. Do not expect any miracles. You get what you pay for.please note my review relates to a stay in July 2004. This hotel is now undergoing refurbishment so I'd be intersted to see how much it improves."
50,609,"Jan 25 2005	Convenience with charm	We stayed here two years ago for a night enroute back to the States. The Castleton is just a few short blocks from Paddington Station, the hub for Heathrow Express as well as all the regular London Underground tube lines. I'll be staying here again for another transit night in a few weeks. Ask for any corporate discounts which may apply. It's an old building, but with helpful staff and clean rooms. Breakfast included. A real London bargain."
51,609,Apr 1 2004	Avoid	No elevator. Room on top floor. Beds were lumpy.

1,614,Aug 6 2005 	Long Time Customer of Central London	I am a long time user of Central London Apartments for the last 10 years. I have always found the apartments located on Bloomsbury to be quite comfortable and perfect for having a flat rather than a hotel. Friends have stayed in some of the other apartments (Regency?) and found them a bit dull and dark. It can really depend on which apartment you get. Some are better some are worse. Bathrooms vary as does room size. So
2,614,Jun 3 2005	Don't do it	I reserved the Regency Apartments on March 8 (for a July visit) with Central-London-Apartments
3,614,Jan 20 2005	The best accomodation provider bar none	We stay in London regularly and like so many other people who venture into this urban jungle
1,616,Nov 11 2009	Probably the best deal near the Tower of London.	The hotel was a bit worn down and had a small elevator. Watch them for unwanted or extra charges. The rooms are clean and not too small. It is close to the Tower of London and the Aldgate tube stops.
2,616,"Oct 27 2009 	Excellent.	Very pleasant stay. Excellent location - handily located about a 2 minute walk from 2 tube stations.Room was excellent, clean and comfortable although only a single bed. And the decor is Breakfast was good but very expensive. Room was expensive in my book (150/night) but I guess in London terms that is quite reasonable for such a good hotel.Recommended, and would definitely stay again provided I wasn't paying the bill!"
3,616,"Sep 24 2009 	decent place good location	It is an acceptable hotel. The rooms were clean. Easy walking distance to the tower of London. There was no parking onsite, but some parking lots not too far away (1/3 mile). The staff was not all that friendly, though, souring the stay."
4,616,"Aug 22 2009 	Great Overnight Stay at the Chamberlain	Stopped overnight in a twin room number 410 light airy and plenty of space, more than some more expensive hotels that we have stopped in. The staff were all excellent and very helpful. Room and bathroom were well prepared and clean, breakfast was in with the rate and was good but wouldnt have been worth the 16 each if it wasnt.The location is on the fringes of the City and at five oclock the bar and local bars were bouncing but everyone had gone home by nine.We walked down to Tower Bridge which was nice to see lit up at night. i would have no hesitation in stopping again but it may not suit someone that wants to be in the thick of it tourism wise."
5,616,"Aug 14 2009 	Wonderful Rooms with Attached Pub	As you can see from the title, I was mostly excited about this hotel because it is owned by a London brewery (Fuller's) and had an attached pub. Not to mention I booked what I thought was a pretty good rate for a good hotel 135 pounds a night (a hotel in my home town costs more than that!) on the hotel website. The location is excellent, it is right off the Tower Hill tube stop and that tube station has only a small number of steps to drag your suitcase up.The hotel has a lift. The twin room we were given was fantastic. Messages from the hotel staff (who are all very good) appear on your TV. The bathroom was huge, with shower AND bath. Oh yeah, TV next to the bathtub. Big shower. Bath robes in the closet and a very nice turndown service that leaves bath slippers. If I had used a bath towel during the day and after the room had been made up, the turn down service would replace it with a fresh towel.The air conditioning was wonderful. I have stayed in London hotels with none. But in July and August it's essential to have it. And this one was always nice and cool. In fact, a bit chilly first thing in the morning. Good thing you have the robes!Breakfast did not come with our booking so I only went to the pub for dinner and drinks. The pub had six different cask ales on offer. Which far exceeded my expectations. The menu was reasonably priced - for London. The food, which was quite good, was always delivered in a timely manner. The waitstaff that I interacted with was made up entirely of non-Brits, but all spoke English well and had minimal problems with my American accent. In fact, I found them to be especially curious about the US and we spoke often about traveling in the US. Perhaps that's why over the course of the week I found the service to be very good. But for me it was.My only complaint is the noise level. We had a first floor room (second floor if you are an American). I could hear and feel the subway train and hear some of the road traffic as well. From my room I could hear the water pipes from the nearby rooms whistle when someone was showering. I am a light sleeper, but this noise didn't appear to upset my sleep patterns all that much after the initial recognition that it was there."
6,616,"Aug 14 2009 	Nice hotel - Very uncomfortable bed	The hotel is beautifully decorated, clean spacious rooms. Bar area is very well decorated and atmospheric. The area is quiet at weekends. Recommend St Katherines dock behind the tower hotel which is pretty and has bars and restaurants there. Staff were very friendly and helpful, though a few people seemed to have problems checking in. All was fantastic apart from the mattresses on the bed that I could feel the springs through, though other rooms may not have the same problem. It doesnt matter how nice the hotel looks if you don't get a good nights sleep."
7,616,Aug 13 2009 	Good value for money friendly staff good location	this hotel was great for the money good location next to tubes and tower of london/tower bridge.Staff were friendly and helpfull. We had breakfast included which was the continental buffet which was ok but the english breakfast was priced at 16.50 so we had to pay and extra 4 for a basic english breakfast. Rooms were ok for money but we werent in the room very long lol
8,616,"Aug 7 2009 	Definitely get a weekend deal	For us this was a terrific little landing pad for our arrival in England. We got a great deal at 1800hotels, but we could probably have done better if we'd call them directly. I don't mind so much because we got upgraded to a a &quot;luxury&quot; room. The posted price is ridiculous, but it's targeting business clientele with expense accounts.The room was comfy and the bathroom was great--a wonderful shower. The location is excellent. The staff were unevenly pleasant and helpful. The ladies were lovely, the men more on the surly side. The one breakfast we had there was disappointing, but we mostly slept through it as we dealt with jetlag. Surprisingly, the restaurant was quite nice for dinner. Internet access was convenient. Nice little hotel."
9,616,"Aug 6 2009 	Lovely hotel exceeded my expectations. 10/10!	Considering my husband and I usually stay at Claridges when in London I was a bit worried about booking a cheap hotel but having been credit crunched we decided to just book a hotel that offered a nice bedroom rather than the whole 5 star experience we usually have. I need not have worried. The hotel was of a high standard and the staff were incredibly helpful indeed. The rooms were wonderful: striking a nice balance between modern yet tastefully traditional. Loved the marble bathrooms and robe and slippers in the room. Nice touch. Breakfast was excellent (continental inc in our room rate) and the service prompt. Coffee was dire but everything else delicious. Little pastries, fresh fruit, yoghurts, cheeses, hams etc. They even warmed your milk for your (albeit horrible) coffee if you wanted which I particularly liked. The only thing that I felt the hotel could do better on is the size of the beds but then I am spoilt. At home we have a kingsize bed and like I say we usually stay at Claridges so maybe this is the norm elsewhere? The beds were standard double and the mattress 'bouncy', a sign that it is not of good quality in my opinion. But the linens and pillows were fantastic. A king or even queen size bed would have been better.An excellent base for exploring London as the Minories is nice and quiet at the weekends and only a 2 min wallk to several tubes or down to the Tower of London where you can catch the Thames Crusier Boat. Super fast, great value and a lovely way to see London from the river. I felt the money my husband and I paid (164.00 for 2 nights B&amp;B through GreatLateDeals.co.uk) versus the quality was outstanding and I was very impressed indeed, in fact it exceeded my expectations. 10/10!"
10,616,"Jul 21 2009 	Good value if you get a weekend deal	As reported by other reviwers this is a very good hotel just up the road behind the tower of London. The rack rate shown in reception is 230 a night without breakfast. This is a bit over the top to say the least.However we paid only 135 for a saturday night and 55 for the sunday night. and this was including breakfast. The breakfast was excellent too, if a little bit chaotic and slow, The rooms are spacious for London and teh Aldgate tube station is only 100 metres away. There is a bus station across the road. The area is pretty dead at weekends and teh hotel bar/pub closes at 11 pm."
11,616,Jul 13 2009 	Excellent Hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Chamberlain Hotel for three nights. My husband had to return to work and my sister arrived for seven more nights to sightsee with me. The staff were most friendly and helpful. The hotel and room was clean and beautifully decorated. It was also very quiet which we appreciated after busy days sightseeing. The location was ideal -- only two blocks or so from the Tower of London and right near the underground. They also had free internet so I was able to connect with family at home. I would DEFINITELY stay there again and recommend it without reservation. Thank you to Alice and others who made it such an enjoyable stay for us!
12,616,"Jun 23 2009 	Nice hotel good location	Chamberlain is conveniently located near the Tower of London. The room was very nice. I only stayed for 1 night, but my impression of this hotel was very favourible."
13,616,"Jun 15 2009 	""Great find""	Booked direct with the hotel &amp; received a great deal.On arrival the booking in procedure was perfect, the smiling receptionist was pleasant/ friendly and asked all the right questions &amp; made you feel that they were pleased to have your business.We were upgraded to a roof terrace room which had all the &quot;niceties&quot; .The only thing which dissapointed me was the cooked breakfast- and I can see from previous reviews that this stands up- it was very poorly presented, but on the upside actually tasted quite good. Certainly say that the management and staff are doing a very god job - well done, and would have no hesitation in staying again."
14,616,"May 24 2009 	Good hotel in quiet area	The Chamberlain is a great hotel for a few days' stay in London. Situated just a few minutes from the Tower of London in a quiet area that practicalley &quot;dies&quot; in the weekends. Very quiet, but not far to go to experience more life. Quiet at night. The room was great, well-furnished, and the bathroom was wonderful. Nice touch with the TV in the tiles on the wall of the bath-tub. The beds were good, and the room had coffee- and tea-making-facilities, and a minibar. Cleaning was good. Pub and restaurant close to the reception. We ate in the restaurant one evening, and that was ok. The only down-side was the serving of breakfast. There was a total lack of logistic when serving the breakfast - up to five people serving a half full breakfast room, but still we had to wait for over 45 minutes to get egg and bacon. This seemed to be reality for the other guests as well. Everyone in the breakfast room seemed to be annoyed, and we saw several people leaving the room before they got served. Seemingly, the staff worked hard, but they didn't manage to organise the work. It was actually worth a study, which I recommend the hotel management to undertake. Other than that, the hotel was great, and next time we are in London, we will definitely consider to stay there again."
15,616,"May 12 2009 	Lovely	The rooms at the Chamberlain are very nicely decorated and very comfortable. The cooked breakfast is delicious, although quite expensive. Service at the hotel was very good.Location is great for visiting the Tower of London, or if you're a business traveller as it's in the City. The hotel is very close to Aldgate station, so no problems with transport. However, at night it is quiet as there are not many restaurants nearby, and if you go on the weekend, the few restaurants that are around are closed, as are most of the shops! However - this would not stop me staying there again, it was a delightful hotel, and the walk to the tourist attractions and restaurants did me good!"
16,616,"Feb 6 2009	Great location good value	I have stayed in the Chamberlain in the past, but it was usually for business. This time I decided to stay for a weekend with my bf and it was an average visit. We checked in on the Fri evening and checked out on the Sun afternoon. Check out was 11am, which is quite early for a Sunday but when we asked on the Friday about extending the check out, were told to call on the Sunday morning. There was no problem and it was probably nearer 12.30 when we leftcheck in was prompt but the receptionist was just doing the job, could have been a bit more friendly, didn't ask if we needed help with anything else. We called later that night to see if there was ice machine on any floor, but there was none. No complimentary water in the room either which you would expect in most hotels.Breakfast was included, but only continental. An extra 4 GBP for the full English..my bf had this and was not worth 16.50 GBP. For anyone on room rate only, you are better off to head out and get a cheaper meal. Location is very good. On Friday night however, there are many clubs and pubs around and it is very nosy. Come Saturday though and it's like a different place, sooo quiet!We got an excellent rate on a discount website, so cant complain much more. However if I had paid the room rate directly from the hotel site I would be looking for a discountRoom was clean, shower wasn't great, toiletries minimal, but there were big towels!Cant imagine I would be back, but if I am sent with work I'll put up with it"
17,616,"Feb 3 2009 	Clean recently decorated good value for money	Stayed here for two weekend nights in Club room in January at very reasonable rates(80 per night including breakfast for 2). The room though not very large, was clean, well maintained and recently redecorated in Edwardian? style (oak style furniture), as was lobby and restaurant. Slight stain and wear on dark carpets only visible sign of age. Well isolated from Pub section. Club rooms overlook moderately busy road but good sound insulation so this was not a problem. Check in and service efficient and unobtrusive - no problems or complaints so didn't get to test it out. Location suited me and should have been easy access to Cityy airport viaTower Gateway station, but unfortunately closed at time of visit. Short walk to Tower hill station and Riverside bus nearby direct to Tate and Covent Garden. Reasonable walk to restaurants in Brick Lane or bus to Covent Garden. Close to Tower of London, otherwise business district with a few business pubs and restaurants. Particularly enjoyed breakfast with lots of fresh fruit available. Hotel at weekend was well suited to mature couple on romantic weekend break with a tight budget."
18,616,"Jan 7 2009 	Love this hotel	This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel both Saturday nights. It is a beautiful hotel settled right in the quiet city district so no outsie noise on weekends and only a 5 minute stroll to both tower bridge and the tube. Excellent location the bar next door to the hotel is lovely and serves lovely reasonable priced food. Excellent base for a weekend trip to London to see the sites and for a bargain price of 89 who can complain. The rooms was very reasonably sized and immaculately clean with fresh towels etc, receptionists were lovely and the buffet breakfast was superb. I would definately stay here again. As for the person who was complaining about the hotel, I think they stayed in the wrong one!"
19,616,"Dec 3 2008 	Great Hotel	We stayed ay Chamberlain Hotel in November 2008 and it was a very pleasant experience. The hotel looked even better than on the websites. The rooms were large, nice furnished and very clean.We would stay again at the Chamberlain Hotel."
20,616,"Nov 10 2008	Loved the hotel and location	Great weekend rates - because the business district is quiet at weekends, some people dislike the location, but we found it a real bonus. Tubes were quiet and less than 5 minutes walk away. We found receptionists very friendly and welcoming, and they sorted out a problem with my bill very quickly. The bar staff are also very helpful and friendly. We loved the breakfasts and the bar meals were very well priced for London. Hotel is close to Tower Bridge, Tower of London and a very short bus ride to St Pauls. Use an Oyster card and plan your journeys by bus and tube to minimise costs to travel to other sights. Sightseeing bus stops just outside Tower - recommend for first time visitors.Will definitely stay here any time i am in London. Stayed in nearby 5* hotel last time and the Chamberlain beat it by a mile for service and value."
21,616,"Sep 19 2008 	love the chamberlain	we loved the chamberlain hotel we stayed there for two nights at the start of our holiday. the room was just nice if a bit small but for only two night and london standards it was great. excellent value for money at the discount rate we paid. if had to fault something and i am picking at straws it would have to be that to find somewhere to eat close to the hotel was difficult because the hotel was located in the business district however it was not even a two minute walk to the tower hill tube station, where you could get just abouot anywhere you wanted to eat. overall concluision i would recommend staying here as it is clean comfortable safe and friendly. just a small note i think there is the worlds smallest plasma in the bathtub."
22,616,"Jul 29 2008 	Overpriced and run down	This was my 3rd stay in the hotel, via work. There are much nicer hotels in London for less money. The rooms are clean and small. On this stay the sink had no plug, this was not replaced following my request, nor where towels provided! The roof in the bathroom had mold growing and was covered in stains. In general the fittings in all of the rooms I stayed in did not fit flushly, and gives the impression they were fitted together quickly. Also none of the TV's in the bathrooms seem to be working, and are very old. So dont be fooled by the hotel description. However the beds and sheets are very nice and the main room looks homely. Overall I cannot recommend this hotel. I feel many of the reviews for this hotel are exaggerated by people who know no better."
23,616,"Jul 11 2008 	Great Hotel In London	We stayed at this hotel for a weekend stay in London. The hotel was really clean, and the service was really good. The Chamberlain is in the business district of London, so it is quiet at the weekends (and there are not many restaurants open). This was ideal for us, as we are light sleepers, and it meant a really good nights sleep. The tube is literally 60 seconds around the corner, so for daytrips and evening meals we were able to go out and about easily (even with my wife in high heels), and London was our &quot;oyster&quot;! The breakfast at The Chamberlain was really good. A nice selection of items for either the continental or full english.Although we checked out on Sunday morning, we were able to keep our bags at the hotel until Sunday evening. This was great, as it meant we didn't have to lug our suitcases all around London (and Harrods!).The weekend rates are really competitive. The following link was the cheapest we could find (about 80 per night, including breakfast). http://www.benbow.org.uk/chamberlain.htmI would recommend the hotel to anyone, and will be staying here again for future weekend breaks in London."
24,616,Jul 10 2008 	Beautiful hotel close to transportation	The hotel gave us an up graded room which was larger and was one of the nicest hotels we stayed in while in Europe. The staff were very friendly. The room was equivalent to the Raddisson rooms we had in Amsterdam &amp; Copenhagen. The tube and buses are very close by and the breakfast they included was excellent. We could have the English breakfast as well as anything from the breakfast bar. You are only 5 minutes walk from ther beautiful Tower bridge. They have special weekend rates because it is in a business district where some of the restaurants and pubs are closed during the weekend. We just had their big breakfast and took the bus to an area we wanted to discover for the rest of the day. I would stay there again for sure!The weekend rates make it more reasonably priced than alot of the other hotels in London.
25,616,"Jul 4 2008 	Nice hotel	Stayed here for one night only - it is set above a pub on a busy City thoroughfare, but the rooms are well protected from the outside and are very clean and comfortable with all the usual facilities. Good location for exploring the City and there are lots of nice places to eat nearby.Recommended."
26,616,"Jul 4 2008 	Great for us!	Had a really enjoyable weekend stay here - we were upgraded to a superior room which was really nice.We didnt find the location at all inconvenient (as some people have mentioned) tower hill tube station is just a few mins walk away (as is Aldgate) so all of London is very easily accessible from here, it was actually nice to stay somewhere a bit less hectic!We walked to the globe theatre ( the purpose of our stay was to see mid summer nights dream) which took about 20 mins &amp; was quite a nice walk, added to the fact that its so close to Liverpool street station, the one that we use so its perfect for us.The staff were really friendly &amp; helpful, &amp; we also thought the breakfast (that was included in our discounted nightly price of 88) was very good too.We will definitely stay here again &amp; have no reservations about recommending it to others."
27,616,Jul 4 2008 	Excellent value.	Booked this hotel at an excellent rate with Otel.com.Very pleased with the cleanliness and comfort of The Chamberlain. Room was a very good size for a London hotel and breakfast was good with a lovely choice of fresh fruits.Very conveniently situated close to the Tower Of London and Tower Gateway station.Would definitely consider staying here again when visiting London.
28,616,"May 15 2008 	Lacking something	We spent 2 nights here in May, when my partner and I were attending a family wedding. Great rates, and all in all a very clean well presented hotel.Just a couple of minor gripes about the hotel and location:1. In the City, so don't expect any nearby restaurants and bars to be open at the weekend....it's just DEAD !!2. Air conditioning not up to par, especially on a hot day.3. Bar staff terrible...didn't have a clue about customer service. Ant the bar itself closes at 10pm on a Sunday evening, and they ask you to leave and take your drinks with you !If this place really wants to live up to its 4 star rating, then it has to buck its ideas of hospitality when it comes to food and drink.Having said all that, couldn't fault anything else!"
29,616,"May 6 2008	Nice friendly (and a really good deal at the weekend)	I spent a Sunday night in this hotel in late April and was very impressed. The reception staff was friendly, the room nice and well presented. The bar nice and not too crowded on a Sunday evening. The continental breakfast delivered to the room was huge and taste. So overall a really nice stay!As somebody else remarked it's a very quiet area at the weekend, but it's very close to several tube stations, so you won't be stuck there. Especially recommended for a weekend as the room rate is condiserably lower."
