267,1791,"Apr 29 2008 	Great Place to stay with the family!!	We have stayed at the Doubletree Suites hotel several times with the kids. There are two rooms, so it's spacious and a bargain by New York standards. There's a great breakfast buffet that gets you off to a good start for the day. I love the location and it's wonderful to be right at Times Square!! My husband and I like to stay at the Waldorf when it's just us, but the Doubletree is great for Theatre and nightlife when taking kids (I say kids, but they are 24, 19, and 16!)"
268,1791,"Apr 28 2008 	Losing its Edge	I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Doubletree Times Square. The first 3 nights I was alone on business and my wife and two kids joined me for the 4th night. My first 2 hours at the hotel were miserable - wifi not working and after 30 minutes on the phone with tech support, was told that there was a problem with the local router and I should move to another section of the hotel. Wifi worked fine in room #2, but when I opened the fridge, there was a half eaten nacho plate from the previous occupant. Room service varied from fine (can't mess upa club sandwich) to lousy (cold - not even lukewarm- eggs and bacon). I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past year, and each time the service seems to drop a notch."
269,1791,"Apr 27 2008 	Fantastic Hotel in the middle of everything!	We just returned from a short stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square and it could not have been any better! We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was terrific to have the extra space. We arrived at 10:00 am and our room happened to be ready even though check in isn't until 3:00 pm. Our luggage was delivered within 10 minutes. We booked the American Girl package and my daughter received a special bed, blanket and pillow for her American Girl doll. She was thrilled! The room had a microwave and small fridge which was nice to have when traveling with children. The staff, from the doorman, the guest services representative, concierge to housekeeping were friendly and helpful. We ate dinner one evening in the hotel restaurant and the food was very good. This hotel is right in the middle of Times Square and you can walk to just about everything. We will definitely be back! Check out the Evergreen Diner around the corner for a great breakfast!!"
270,1791,"Apr 23 2008	Great location Very nice staff!	Just returned home from mini-vacation with two young children. Doubletree Suites was a perfect spot for all the tourist attraction NYC has to offer especially if traveling with children. At check in, Damaris, our guest service agent was kind, helpful, and very knowledgable about the city. We arrived at 10am and our room was ready even though check in isnt until 3pm. It was nice after a long train ride to get up to our room and relax with our nice warm cookies. We had a corner Times Square view room on the 10th floor with a view that cant be beat. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. And quite a decent size for a NYC hotel room. One minor complaint would be the smell of smoke from all the guests smoking in the hallways near the elevators though this really isnt the hotel's fault. Overall, a great stay."
271,1791,"Apr 22 2008 	Absolutely Fantastic	We stayed at this hotel for 4 days, and we absolutely loved it. The staff are very friendly and actually cared. They ALL went out of their way to make the stay enjoyable. There was no question or request that they did not take time for and honor it. They ALL went above and beyond. They view was excellent and the rooms were superb for a city. The breakfast is fantastic in the restaurant, and employees were very accomodating there also. Bellhops gave us directions and hints as to what to do for sightseeing. There is a concession at the concieriege for booking play tickets also. We saw Wicked and Young Frankenstein, both were sold out but they were able to get tickets. They were expensive for the service, but for Wicked we had center stage second row, they couldn't have been any better. FANTASTIC and eventhough it is an expensive hotel, it is worth it."
272,1791,"Apr 21 2008 	In the heart of the action	We stayed in these suites for 4 nights with two children aged 12,11. The kids loved the location as they could watch the ever changing neon signs (especially the M&amp;M's one directly across the street. The accomodation was clean and adequate. The staff were pleasant and our plumbing problem was immediately attended to when pointed out. The hotel is particularly useful if you are interested in the shows as they are right in the heart of the theatre district. Most of the sights are within easy walking distance and you will be spoiled for choice for eating out especially breakfast. Try the Manhattan deli - fabulous selection and very reasonably priced. I can't really fault these suites and yes I would stay there again."
273,1791,"Apr 15 2008	Central position	Decided to stay here as we were travelling with two teenagers. Times Square was a great position for the teenagers but too busy and crowded for me and my husband. It would have been really bad in the summer. Having said that, the hotel was fine and the staff helpful. Rollaways are not available which meant my husband had to sleep on the not very comfortable pull out couch.Had a two bedroom suite in the Eastgate Towers last year which overall I prefered."
274,1791,"Apr 14 2008 	Great place to stay with children	Stayed there last week with the family (two children under 10), it was a great experience. The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and serviced every day.We had complimentary breakfast included which was ok, though the eating area is not very inspiring.Over all I think this was exactly what we needed and having the two rooms made a big difference in the evening when the kids went to sleep."
275,1791,"Apr 10 2008 	Great for families with teenagers.	We are a family with two older teenagers (girl and boy) who stayed for the first week in April 2008 at The Doubletree Guest Suites, Times Sq. - it was exactly what we needed. The location is so central, you can walk (if you're fit) everywhere.We booked directlly through hotel website as I found this much cheaper then Expedia etc. We had a 2 dble, 2 rm, large suite-sofabed highflyer because of anticipated noise - you really can't hear much on the 34th floor! - and the views were great. The room were average size with loads of storage. The decor was a little tired and worn, but perfectly acceptable. The two double beds seemed a little small to us, but the kids had them and we stayed on the kingsize sofa-bed which was comfy and worked out fine. This is the best solution for teenagers as you can shut the door on their mess as parents are more likely to keep the living area tidy! The &quot;kitchenette&quot; area was useful for refreshments and snacks. We stocked the fridge with juice, milk, fruit, biscuits and beers etc and didn't need to touch the expensive mini-bar, although we discovered too late you can ask for crockery/cutlery if you wanted to have cereal/bread etc. The extra sink is useful as an extra vanity area. The shower was powerful and the room spacious, a door to each room was useful for privacy. The room was thoroughly cleaned and beds made daily. The staff were friendly and helpful. The Concierge was not at all pushy as I have read and helpfully booked better helicopter flights for us than I had seen on the internet (Manhattan Helicopters only company licenced to fly OVER the city) Only thing we had against The Doubletree was the breakfast. This was not included in our tariff but we decided to try it one morning. Expensive and dull! $18 continental and $24 for cooked. Literally round the corner from the hotel, we found the Evergreen Diner. Friendly, fast service, lots of locals having breakfast, loads of choice, large portions and it cost an average of $5-6 each! We became regulars and didn't need to eat again till evening! Our whole experience of New York was great and The Doubletree was a welcome haven to come back to at the end of an exhausting day. Even our (seemingly) world weary teenagers found it all pretty cool especially the free warm cookies which they had the cheek to ask for daily!"
276,1791,"Apr 7 2008	Great for families	My husband, 12 year old and 8 year old followed up our DC trip with a three night stay in NYC. I was so nervous because of the bed bug epidemic in NY (if you don't know what I am talking about, check it out on the internet, you need to be informed.) My husband checked in ahead of us to check everything out and all was well. The room was clean overall, although showing its age in little ways that I found to be acceptable. I am picky so I will mention that I noticed that in the hallways you can tell that the vacuum doesn't make it to the edges (guess they would need an attachment)so it is a little dirtier there, but not horribly so. This was also true around the door jam that led from the bedroom into the bathroom--a little dusty. Otherwise very clean.Comfy beds. Slept great. This is NY so no free breakfast (buffet was around $24 or so I believe, not sure, didn't buy it) and parking was $35 a day with no access to car unless we wanted to pay more, but that is to be expected there. One nice security feature is that you walk past a man at a podium when you first go in to the elevators off of the street , who asks to see your key until he becomes familiar with you. The elevator stops at the lobby on the third floor so you need to then walk past the front desks to the next bank of elevators to proceed to the rooms. Great location. About 2 short blocks from the subway, could see the M &amp; M store from our window (kids loved that), close walk to the 3 story Toys R' Us, Hershey Store, etc.Expensive, but I think worth it. Friendly staff. Great cookies at check in!"
277,1791,"Mar 30 2008 	Great location; overall underwhelming	Hotel is in a great location. Dead in the middle of Times Square. Easy walks to the theatres and plenty of restaruants. If touring out of the area, convenient subway stops and plenty of taxis.Had a problem with reservations. Initially three of us going and had a king suite with sofa sleeper with Times Square view. Another daughter decided to go and I checked twice to make sure it was ok and was told it was. The week before the trip I called again to make triple sure and was told that they would not permit 4 in the room. After speaking to the manager, I was able to get reservations for a double with sofa sleeper. It made no sense to me to require the double beds instead of the king. The kids slept on the sofa anyway; we just had smaller beds to deal with. Very aggravating.Service is ok, nothing more. Rooms were cleaned well and were quiet and comfortable. Utilitarian but pretty expensive at $500+ a night with taxes.We wanted Times Square and were satisfied. If we come again, we will stay elsewhere though."
278,1791,"Mar 25 2008	Great Location! Service is So so	Top notch location-you can not beat it. Rooms overlook Times Square, so you are in the heart of the action but block out the noise for some peace and quiet. Service is not anything special. They are really pushing certain tickets if you ask for help. Not too helpful about other things. Worth the money but could use some customer service lessons."
279,1791,Mar 20 2008	Beware concierge	The concierge is not a real concierge. They are there to sell you their products and tickets at a really high price. You can go across the street and buy Broadway tickets for 1/2 price or go tot the box office.
280,1791,"Mar 18 2008 	Nice rooms	Big room, nice linens, very clean, great location, and affordable. Michael at the front desk was great! From the time we checked in to the time we check out we felt like we were a valued guest. Two Thumbs Up!Only negative and I mean the only.... typical problem with some hotels, drainage in the tub. They took care of it immediately!"
281,1791,"Mar 10 2008 	Well located great for families	Stayed over the weekend with a 4 year old and a friend, so the separate rooms worked out great. We did have to move rooms since the first one had a view of a wall (I guess if you use points you don't get a view!). Once we moved, we were on the 16th floor with great views. Bed was comfortable, rooms were clean and bathroom had been renovated. Very well located for any NYC activities. Staff was hit or miss on good service."
282,1791,"Mar 10 2008 	Great for family group lots of room	Directly on Times Square, front door adjoins the front door to Legally Blonde. Right in the middle of the action, but crowds and pace on the sidewalks may be a bit intense for some, and particularly for anybody with a stroller or walking aid.Definitely worth upgrading to a package that includes the complimentary breakfast buffet. The buffet included fresh fruit, hot oatmeal, hot breakfast meats, omelettes and eggs made to order, pancakes and waffles to order, cold meat and cheese selection, smoked salmon, juices, breakfast pastries. Something for everyone, and open until 11:30 each morning. Our suite had two double beds plus living room and pull out couch. Decor very pleasant, kitchenette was helpful. Extra sink and large mirror in kitchenette area doubled as an extra vanity. Three women and all their stuff fit nicely, not crowded, very comfortable.The fitness center is under construction, temporary quarters are crowded but servicable. The business center had three computers and servicable printer, all worked well and was convenient.No complaints, great stay, will return if travelling with family. For a romantic holiday, go several blocks away from Times Square for a more calm and relaxing experience."
283,1791,"Mar 7 2008 	Nice place	We stayed in a suite with two 6 month olds and three adults. The rooms were small, but very comfortable. The bathroom was huge! This location was convenient to restaurants and shopping. The babies loved the Hard Rock Cafe! I would stay here again."
284,1791,"Mar 4 2008 	Falling Standards	Stayed again in Feb this year, we have stayed several times before but I think it will be the last time. Used to be our hotel of choice in NYC but the standards keep falling. Possibly the worst bit was a truly awful room service meal on Valentines night and the lack of any real desire to sort the problem. The size of the rooms are on the large side but there are better places in NYC for the same money. Sort yourselves out Doubletree."
285,1791,"Mar 1 2008	Fantastic place to stay	My husband and myself, together with our 4 year old son stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites on 16th Feb 2008 for four nights to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday. Having never been to New York before, we wanted to be in the heart of Times Square and the Doubletree certainly is. We had a suite on the 9th floor and had a great view of Times Square and you couldn't hear any noise at night. My son slept on the double pull out sofa bed in the lounge which was more than adequate. Our bed was huge and very comfortable. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and when we needed more coffee for our room, housekeeping delivered it almost immediately. The fresh coffee machine came in very handy as while we were there is was quite cold, although on the Monday you didn't need a coat on! The Doubletree is within walking distance to Central Park, Empire State Building, Macy's and the Greyline Sightseeing Tour Bus Stop is opposite. There are plenty of places to eat and drink and some people say that eating and drinking in Times Square can be expensive. We found it very reasonable and around the corner there is an Bar/Restaurant called 'Lanagans' which the locals use and they make you feel very welcome, especially our 4 year old and the food is great there. We booked all our tickets to the Empire State, Statue of Liberty, Helicopter ride over Manhatten, Federal Reserve Bank, Hop on-hop off bus tour and a Broadway Show on-line before we travelled and are glad we did because you then have everything planned before your trip and everything went to plan. You cannot go wrong by staying at the Doubletree and we would definately stay there again."
286,1791,Feb 29 2008 	Excellent	Excellent Hotel with a great location in Times Square and within walking distance of all main attractions and shops. Perfect for a 1st time visit to New York.Suites were very clean and comfortable - rellay nice to have a lounge area after a longs days shopping and sight seeing. No breakfast at this hotel but there are loads of delis and diners to choose from....we particularly liked Evergreen which was just around the corner.The subway stop is right next door to the hotel so perfect when you want to venture a little further.All in all I would recommend this hotel and would definitley stay here when I visit New York again.
287,1791,"Feb 29 2008 	Great Stay!	We stayed at the doubletree for Valentine's Day weekend and loved it. The room was clean, and big by NY standards. We live in NY now, but thought it might be fun to do a &quot;tourist thing.&quot; All in all, it was reasonably priced and had great views of Times Square and the Hudson River (I should mention, we were on the 31st floor).I would reccomend this hotel highly!"
288,1791,"Feb 26 2008 	Great Hotel in Wonderful City	My sister and I took our dream vacation to New York City and decided to stay smack dab in the middle of Times Square. The Doubletree Guest Suites is right in the center of everything. We got a one bedroom suite with a pull out sofa (okay, the sofa wasn't very comfortable) and a fantastic view of Times Square. We arrived at about 7:30 AM and check-in wasn't until 3:00 PM, but our room was ready! our intention was to have them hold our bags until check-in but they sent us right up to a room.The employees at the concierge desk were SO FRIENDLY and accomodating. They talked with us and showed an interest in what we were doing in New York and how we were enjoying our stay. They helped us with reservations for dinner, last minute Broadway tickets, directions for sightseeing, etc. I thought the noise from the street would bother me and night, but it was actually very quiet. We didn't use the hotel facilities, but there is a restaurant, gym and cafe that looked great. The doormen were kind, and although they say you are required to show your room key when entering, they didn't seem to enforce that rule too much.The rooms were clean and provided exactly what we needed, a place to crash after a day of sightseeing and exploring."
289,1791,"Jan 31 2008 	Nice Time Square Suite	This is a great location and a great choice if you want to have a 2-room suite. I traveled with my teenage son and this was perfect for us. I used the bedroom and he took the pull out sofa in the living room. The bathroom is off the hallway so we did not disturb each other to use the toilet during the night. We had a Time Square view which was really cool. The only down side is that the sofa bed was really hard to open. Once the houskeeper showed us how to do it, no problem. Also, the upholstery &amp; carpet is starting to show some wear &amp; tear. This hotel is consistently sold out so I'm sure these rooms take a beating! The front desk &amp; coffee bar clerks are friendly and the door guy always checks your key. Another down side, it's pretty hard to get a taxi from here, the corner is an awkward spot, a couple times a taxi driver asked where I wanted to go, then said he was not availble! I learned to get in the taxi first, then tell them where to go! One more point, I also stayed at the Hotel Qt and at the Hilton Times Square. Both of those other properties are better for a couple or single person. Hotel Qt is perfect for under 30 party atmospere. The Hilton is very nice for a couple.Would stay again if visiting NYC with children."
290,1791,"Jan 22 2008	Great Hotel Great Location	If you have never been to NYC, then the price of hotels in general may give you cardiac failure. This hotel is no exception. Over $350 for a room?!? This hotel is on Times Square, so if you want to go to the Theater, or anyplace else in the city, this hotel is well located. There is a subway stop under the hotel to take you anywhere. The hotel is clean and quiet, and large for NYC hotel rooms. Staff was helpful. No real complaints."
291,1791,"Jan 21 2008 	Awesome! ONLY way to do Times Square.	This was a stay surrounding a long weekend to see a play and go shopping. It was amazing! Great service and a BEAUTIFUL view of Times Square. Go for the Square view, it is worth it tenfold. Comfy bed, great amenities...walk right out into the action of Broadway and everything else NY has to offer. The staff was courteous and the room service was delicious. Enjoy!!! We even decided to add a night and the staff was great enough to keep us in the same room, even though it was already booked. Thanks, Doubletree!"
292,1791,"Jan 18 2008	Accommodation	I went to New York with my 15 year old daughter for the first time in October 2007. We were originally allocated a king suite on arrival. While it had a lovely view, the sofa bed was unusable as the springs could be felt through the thin mattress. I complained to reception and was reallocated a room with double beds (as I had paid for) - but no view. Apparently the room type is not guaranteed if not booked directly with the hotel. The sofa bed was better than the first one but far short of the comfort of the bed. The result was that my daughter slept in my room. I found this extremely inconvenient and made the accommodation poor value for money - at around 300 ($600) per night I expected to be able to fully use both rooms as bedrooms and I could have saved a lot if I had been prepared to settle for a suite with both sleeping in one room. On check-out I reported that my daughter's MP3 player was missing. I followed up with an email complaint when I got home - but they did not even bother to reply.Good location but could have done better for the money. Safe was very awkward to use at it was at the bottom of a cupboard - but don't be tempted to leave valuables out! P.S. We still had a great holiday."
293,1791,"Jan 14 2008 	Convenient rooms and location staff unfriendly	I travel to New York City one or two times a month with my family and it is very nice to have two rooms for the 4 of us. The hotel is convenient to many attractions in New York City and does have a restaurant on site. However, the breakfast buffet is not very good, but edible. The people at the front desk are not friendly bordering on downright nasty sometimes. One women at the front desk was downright rude. When I contacted double tree about it they did nothing, so my husband and I stay elsewhere when possible.Except for the staff and the breakfast, the rest is fine. However, when you pay $400 + a night I would like something better than fine."
294,1791,"Jan 14 2008	Great location	We stayed here from Jan 9th- Jan13th 2008. A suprise trip for our daughter's 21st birthday. Asked for a room with a good view and got a 13th floor corner room.....not a good one, views over times square, but tiny room, only sofa bed and no armchair, very scruffy, bedside table on only one side of king(??) bed. Asked to change the next day and staff very accomodating, paid a bit more, but got a much bigger room on 30th floor, much more comfortable for the three of us. A superb location, fell out of bed to get coffee and doughnuts for breakfast from a large selection of places. Right near broadway for shows, subway next door, staff very helpful and friendly, room cleaned everyday and beds made up, fresh towels. Very quiet in rooms considering you are right in the hub of things, and great blackout curtains.We loved it!!Checked out at 12 noon and as we idn't have to leave for the airport 'till 3pm, they stored our luggage for us so we could do lunch and last minute shopping.Grabbed bags at 2.45, downstairs and doorman grabbed a cab, couldn't have been easier!"
295,1791,"Jan 12 2008 	Wonderful Christmas Holiday	We stayed here between 22nd December 2007 and 5th January 2008. We checked in at 9pm and it was really easy! We were given a corner suite overlooking Times Square on the 22nd floor. I must say, I wish we were higher. During the day, we could hear street noise and traffic. At night it was quieter, we only heard a few sirens or horns. The view was great! But the flashing signs in the windows did bug us a little, but at night the curtains blocked all of the light so sleeping was easy!The rooms are big for NY hotels. They have 2 rooms - sitting room with a couch, desk, chair and TV. Also a sink, microwave, mini bar, fridge and coffee maker. The coffee maker had take-away cups (like starbucks) so we made our morning coffee to go! The stay was great, housekeeping were wonderful and helpful and the front desk and concierge were great. HOWEVER do not book show tickets with them! We used broadwaybox.com and got 1/2 price tickets for Chicago and Hairspray. We had 3rd row for Chicago and 2nd row Mez, for Hairspray - Awesome seats at half the price! Concierge wanted to charge $152 per ticket and we got them for $62.New Years Eve was easier then we thought. We were at TGI Fridays a few doors down and left at 1am. Took around 1 hours to get back to our room. The staff were great and it was very well run!Christmas in New York is magical! Even though it didn't snow it was such a wonderful experience and the Doubletree was great!"
296,1791,"Jan 11 2008 	Excellent service at this Doubletree	Mr Flippitti and I stayed here from Dec 10-16, 2007. Our suite was on the 39th floor with excellent views. Our daughter flew up from DC to join us halfway through our stay. She slept on the pull-out sofa and found it very comfortable. There were extra pillows for the sofabed but we had to call the front desk to get an extra blanket. They delivered it within 20 minutes. The two-room suite also had a small fridge, coffeemaker and supplies (with styrofoam cups - yuck!) , a microwave and safe. The bedroom and living rm each had a big flat screen TV and enough drawer space to store your clothes for a long stay. The bathroom was also large with upgraded Neutrogena amenities and big fluffy towels which housekeeping always replenished. Breakfast was included in the rate which was nice because we don't like having to go out and forage for breakfast every morning. Breakfast included made-to-order eggs or omelets but the line was often pretty long. They also had lots of fresh fruit, pancakes, cereal and breads. Service was excellent and the restaurant staff was always friendly. We also ordered room-service breakfast one morning. It was delivered within 30 minutes, warm and our omelet orders were perfect!The concierge desk was very helpful, especially with restaurant recommendations and directions and helping us find our way around the subway system. Housekeeping cleaned our room every day, usually knocking at our door by 9AM. They always did an outstanding job replenishing our coffee supplies and making up the sofa bed. We also got turndown service (even the mints). We used the bellman downstairs to help us get a cab twice and both times, they delivered. The hotel entrance is on a corner and during the holidays, it's incredibly busy and congested so catching a cab out front is a lengthy process. We had a late night dinner at the hotel restaurant once when it was pouring rain and cold, our feet hurt from sightseeing and we just didn't want to go out and deal with the crowds. The dinner menu is limited and the food is pretty mediocre so I'd only eat there as a last resort."
297,1791,"Jan 3 2008 	Great location.	Can't beat the location.Rooms are large enough for up to four persons and include not only a convenience bar, but also a fridge, microwave, coffee maker and security safe.Concierge service very helpful.Business center had only three computers, and I did find all three occupied one morning.No complaints."
298,1791,"Jan 1 2008 	Great Location But Is It Worth It?	There is no doubt Christmas is the best time in New York, especially for this warm weather Texas couple. We wanted to stay on Times Square because of the central location, lights and just plain interest in doing so (first time). We knew the price would be high - $650 per night, high floor, Times Square view, but we also expected some value for the dollars spent. The good things: Excellent concierge service, especially for directions. Very central location - everything is easily in walking distance, including a great Irish pub just around the corner. Metro is right next door. Hotel is clean, with all suites (we had a problem - more below, our friends did not). The bad things: we left the hotel each day by mid morning and each day when we returned - late afternoon - the room was not made up. A daily call had to be made to remind the hotel we had been forgotten - even after late afternoon returns. When offered a room off of the elevator banks (I should have known better) DO NOT accept the offer, even if promises are made this is an excellent suite. It is not - more hallway than room, no room in the bedroom and no room in the second room - great view, but NO room to move around. One would think the elevator noise would be overpowering - it was not - didn't even hear it, thus our reason to stay in this room (foolish us). Yes, ask for the view on a high floor - it's worth it, but do not accept a suite behind the elevator banks. You will need to leave the room just to make up your mind. Prices are high in the lounge, but to be expected. Bring your own computer - $.50 a minute is a bit much in the business center. No need to eat at the hotel - just not worth the price or effort as there are way too many great eateries close-by. Also, forget the door man in front - too busy to get you a cab (don't know why, but that's not their thing). We did like the security and the resulting peace of mind. Would we stay again? Really, once you have stayed on Times Square there is really no reason to do it again. There are plenty of great hotels in Manhatten and it's so easy to get around, so why pay the price to stay on Times Square? Got to do it once, though, and if you want a suite (two rooms) the Doubletree is okay, albeit the value is just not there. Perhaps the W across the street has a better feel for how to take care of their customers - certainly having to ask the Doubletree front desk to clean the room each day - sometimes twice in a day - after some hard walking, sightseeing and shopping is not our idea of great service/value for the price paid."
299,1791,"Dec 31 2007 	Excellent Hotel in Times Square	Stayed 7 nights in the Conference Suite on the 38th floor (Diamond Upgrade from a standard king bed) in the middle of Christmas season. Bed was very comfortable and sofa pull-out bed easily fit 2 people. The view of Times Square was amazing! The HHonors free breakfast buffet was better than any Hilton hotels I've been to. The staff was excellent! Included turn down service. Can't beat the location, walking distance to all of the Broadway shows and right next to the subway entrance. Loved NYC at Christmastime &amp; the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square gets 2 thumbs way up!"
300,1791,"Dec 28 2007 	The Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square was FABULOUS	We stayed at the Doubletree Guests suites last week and had a wonderful time. It is in the center of everything. Even with kids most sites are an easy walk. The rooms were immaculate and comfortable, and extremely large by New York standards. We had a room on the 32nd floor and had amazing views and actually left the curtains to the main bedroom open all night to enjoy the lights and sights of Times Square. The breakfast buffet was good, and all hotle staff was extremly helpful. We would recommend this to anyone staying in Manhattan, and definately plan to make this our #1 choice on our next trip to the City."
301,1791,"Dec 21 2007 	Spectacular Location	Big room for New York standards. Close to everything (but can be a bit hectic getting there due to all the traffic in Times Sq.). Breakfast was included since I'm a Gold Hilton Honors Member. Pretty standard stuff, but nice since it is free. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Two room suite definitely helps you spread out a little especially after fighting the crowds just to get to the front door. Great for the first time visitor to NYC since everything most people want to see is within walking distance."
302,1791,"Dec 7 2007 	Big rooms- Slightly tired rooms	Great hotel for a family who wants to be right in the heart of the action. For single travellers there are nicer hotels in the area. First room I was given looked like it had been well used, second room although smaller was a corner room and in much better decoration. Annoys me that you have to pay for Internet access- now staying at the Hilton Garden Express in Chelsea. Smaller room but great neighboorhood and no charge for Internet. Laundry costs in this hotel are also exhorbitant even by NY standards"
303,1791,"Dec 5 2007 	DOUBLETREE GUEST SUITES - GREAT SERVICE WITH A SMILE	The Doubletree was more than we could have hoped for. After making an 11th hour decision to travel to NYC for Thanksgiving, my children (ages 18 and 15) and I, with the help of this forum, selected the Doubletree as our home away from home. We booked less than 48 hours before our arrival at a rate of less than $400 per night. Check in was a breeze even though we arrived before 3pm. Our room (2907) had an amazing view of Times Square. The most appealing aspect of the hotel was location, location, location. The King bed was exceptionally comfortable and large enough for all 3 of us (we accidently fell asleep while watching a movie). The friendliness of the staff was a pleasant surprise. The doorman always greeted us by name and the concierge staff pulled off the unbelievable feat of procuring affordable orchestra level tickets( less than 4 hours before curtain) to one of the few Broadway Shows in production at that time.I unequivocally recommend this hotel for travelers that love being &quot;in the midst of it all.&quot;"
304,1791,"Dec 3 2007	Great time at Double Tree Times Square	My husband and I, with our two sons, aged 10 and 14 stayed here for 3 nights. Our suite was on the 37th floor with fantastic views over times square. The rooms were great and spacious, very large bathroom which was imaculate and lovely lounge area with a pull out sofa bed that my oldest son slept on. There was plenty of extra bedlinen and pillows available in the room. We did not have any problems with check-in, very polite and friendly staff, great warm chocolate chip cookies on arrival.The hotel is in a fantastic location so we never actually dined in the hotel restaurant. There are so many diners, restaurants and fast food places nearby that we were spoilt for choice. We went on the open top bus tours. You can buy tickets from right outside the front of the hotel. It was a great way to see all the sights and they pointed out places we would never have found by ourselves.We had a great time at the Double Tree Guest Suites in Times Square, and while we felt it was expensive we would definatly return and stay here again if we came back to New York."
305,1791,"Dec 2 2007 	Poor value and poor response to complaints	I stayed here for 6 nights in September 2007 with my two sisters. We arrived very late in the day after a long flight from London. I had specified that we wanted two beds plus a sofa bed; however, the sofa bed was broken. We called the reception desk, but they didn't have any solution to offer. There wasn't even any bedding for the sofa bed in the room, so we had a very uncomfortable first night and were unable to unpack. The next morning, we were allocated a different room to which we moved ourselves. The very nice lady on reception offered us complimentary breakfast for our entire stay to make up for the bad start. We thought this was fair, and accepted. The breakfast is expensive and we had not planned to eat in the hotel otherwise. (By the way, with taxes, the cost of our stay was 4,102 USD). So, I was annoyed to find on departure that my credit card had been billed for breakfast for three for the first two days of our stay - another 135.77 USD. We probably wouldn't have spent that for the whole week! There was no one on reception when we left at 4 a.m., so I have been trying ever since to get a refund. It's been promised more than once, but still no show. Every mail I send seems to sit around for at least 2 weeks before I get another hopeless response. I just decided to stop wasting any more of my time and share my experience instead. I wouldn't use this hotel again, even though it's a good location. I feel it was very expensive for the standard of service we received, and I've been more than disappointed by the lacklustre response to my complaint."
306,1791,"Nov 28 2007 	Mostly Good	My family and I stayed at Doubletree Time Square for 3 nights a few days ago. This was our 2nd stay at this property. Our first stay was in 2005. I must say that our first stay was a better one. Although I would still recommend the hotel, there are a few things that I would want others to be aware of. We asked for a Time Square View and we got one. We were given a corner room, which sounds great, but the room was much smaller than the typical 2 room suite. I would recommend that you stay away from the corner units if you are traveling with children and are hoping for the extra room. The view though was pretty good. The room we stayed in wasn't exactly the cleanest room. A few lights were out. I'm sure they just needed a light bulb. Some of the outlets did not work. The hair dryer did not work either. All of these things are just minor inconveniences, that could easily be corrected. The main negative was the lack of space in our room. This room would have been fine for 2 people, but we were traveling with 2 children and it was very tight quarters. Also, you lose the 2nd vanity in the corner rooms. Overall though, you can't beat the value."
307,1791,"Nov 21 2007 	Excellent 4 Star Suite Hotel in Center of Times Square	My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square, NYC for two nites on Nov. 18th &amp; 19th. We picked this hotel because we were able to get an AARP rate of $254.00 compared to the $299 or higher rates of comparable nearby hotels such as the Marriott Marquis and the Renaissance. We had a king size bed in the bedroom and a sleeper sofa in the other room of the suite. The bed was very comfortable with a warm (down?) comforter in a duvet cover and plenty of pillows and soft sheets. As another reviewer wrote, you get what you see on the website. The bathroom has a single sink set in a very long counter, so there is plenty of room for all cosmetics, etc. and there is a large mirror above. it. There is a tub-shower with a shower curtain and the out-curving shower rod. The toliet is not in a separate room. There is plenty of hot water and water pressure. Everything was clean and the housekeeping service was perfect. The &quot;kitchen&quot; consists of a small refrigerator and a microwave and a &quot;bar type&quot; sink and a coffeemaker that dispenses into individual paper cups. We had no problems with leaking refrigerators or &quot;smelly&quot; shower curtains. There was plenty of hot water in the shower. We were on the 27th floor and heard no noise from outside. The airconditioning-heat worked well and was reasonably quiet. Our room did have a view of the Times Square billboards but I understand that some rooms do not. We came in on Sunday at about 1:30 pm and our suite was ready, but of course that will not always be the case. The people at the desk were courteous and quick. We did not use the concierge or room service. The three elevators run quickly and we had no waits. There is a convential TV in the bedroom and in the other room. We did not use the internet service in the room but did go to the business center where $5 is the minimum for internet service, plus $1 for each printed page. The buffet breadfast in the Center State restaurant is OK, with made to order omelets and pancakes, danish, some fresh fruit, etc. But at New York hotel prices of over $20 each, not a good value unless your room rates includes it or you are a high level of Hilton Honors and get it free. There is a 24 hour McDonalds next door to the hotel, perfect for breakfast to take back to your room. Another downpoint is that like many hotels in New York there are no vending machines and no shop, but there are newstands on the streets where you can get the New York Times and sodas at reasonable prices. Of course the &quot;convenience center&quot; in the room charges $3.50 for a soda. The big plus is the wonderful location near all the Broadway theatres so even if it is raining and cold, you can easily walk to the theatre. If you like New York Deli - walk to the Stage Deli at 53rd and 7th Ave - the hotel is at 48th st. &amp; broadway. The &quot;regular sandwiches&quot; and dessert portions will each feed two people and we think this is the best corned beef and pastrami anywhere. If you are sure the weather is going to be nice, you can get lower rates at hotels such as the Marriott Courtyards that are farther from Times Square. For comfort, cleanliness, and especially location, this is the place to stay if you are going to go to Broadway shows. We usually get tickets at a discount over the internet by going to the Playbill internet site where you can join the Playbill club for free and get discount tickets to many shows. Also the TKTS booth is across the street from the hotel."
308,1791,"Nov 21 2007 	Great New York Hotel	We just got back from New York, and this hotel is an excellent find! Yes, it's pricey (but what &quot;decent&quot; hotel in NY isn't??)First of all, the location is right on Times Square. The subway is next to the hotel entrance, so getting around is a breeze. All guests entering the building must show their room key, which means they provide a high level of security. From the main entrance, you take an elevator to the third floor lobby to register. We had no delay checking in, and the reception agent was friendly and helpful. She even gave us extra home-baked chocolate chip cookies, which are a standard feature of Doubletree. YUM!Our suite was on the 35th floor. It was an &quot;upgraded&quot; suite due to my Hilton Honors points. That means we had complimentary internet access plus upgraded toiletries (by Neutregena) and a refrigerator and microwave oven. The living room had a sleeper sofa and the bedroom had a king bed.Excellent soundproofing... but if you want to open your windows, they DO open... a nice option for those who want some &quot;fresh&quot; air (I know, I know, it's New York air... but it's still OUTSIDE air instead of the recycled indoor stuff we breathe in all winter long)Nice selection of satellite channels (over 40), plus free HBO.Overall, a terrific hotel for New York visits, and I plan to return soon!"
309,1791,"Nov 19 2007 	Nice rooms located RIGHT ON TOP OF Times Square	Stayed 3 nights at this property on business in November. Definitely a good option in the area. Details...GOOD:--Rooms are very nice, and very large - suites in fact, at least on the 34th floor - Living room, large bathroom, nice bedroom--Bed was comfortable, had a variety of kinds of pillows--Living space had a nice office chair and modular desk to work at--Staff were all friendly and attentive--Location is, as in the title RIGHT ON TOP OF Times Square. Its right there. Walk out the door and you are there.BAD:--Have to take 2 elevator trips to the rooms, due to their security set up - 1 to enter the hotel lobby area, then a seperate one to the rooms--Be aware that many of the rooms, which face TS, will be hard to make dark at night. You can do all the usual tricks, but still, some of that neon will sneak through. Just be ready for that. The hotel does NOT have true black-out shades or anything like that.--Avoid the restaurant, which was mediocre at best and overpriced (like most of the food in that area).Overall good choice. Tends to be very pricey, even by the standards of the neighborhood - but you get what you pay for. If you need it really dark to sleep, you may want to look elsewhere. But otherwise, especially if the price is right, this is an excellent choice."
310,1791,"Nov 16 2007 	Saved by the location	My Family and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square for 1 week in November 2007.The hotel is situated slam in the middle of Times Square, so the location is perfect.The price we had to pay was exorbitant (500 US$ per room per day!!!), but it was the New York marathon weekend and everything else was fully booked.Upon entering the hotel, you have to show the security guard your key. His is done for obvious reasons as the entrance is right on Times Square and anyone could just march in. You then enter the elevator which takes toy directly to the check in floor. After check in you take a different set of elevators that take you to the other floors.Check-in was smooth and fast and the staff were formally polite. Our rooms were spacious as all rooms of this hotel are 2-room suites. I understand that for New York this is a big plus. We were in the 36th floor so we also had great views.However the cleanliness of the rooms left a lot to be desired. There were crumbs on the desk surface, hairs in the bathtub, and a lot of old dust in all corners. The smoke detector was very dirty and, on a whole, the rooms (as well as the entire hotel) showed signs of very inadequate cleaning. I am a Diamond Honors member so we were given a floor with free WiFi internet, as well as complimentary breakfast, but that is where the perks ended.Breakfast was awful. The breakfast room is small and we had to wait in line for 10-15 to be seated. The whole area stinks of fried oil, the tables are dirty, the staff were bored and impolite, and the food was cold and oily. The only positive thing was that you could order eggs of pancakes to be prepared on the spot. We ate breakfast there only twice, as it was terrible.The concierge service is also very bad. Firstly they tried to sell us show tickets for 220 US$ saying it was sold out, and we walked next door to the theater and got them for 110 US$. Anytime we asked for information, they pressingly tried to sell us everything, even the Metro tickets!On the last day we asked the concierge to book a taxi to take us to the airport and they replied they could only book a private taxi for 180 US$ (as opposed to the normal 50-60$ for a normal taxi!!!).On the whole I would not recommend this hotel, even though the location is top."
311,1791,"Nov 14 2007 	Supurb location Great view!	Location and great views are the draw of this Times Square hotel. I has a corner room (room numbers ending in &quot;03&quot; -- e.g. 2503 on the 25th floor, etc.) with stunning views directly down on Times Square to the east and north. What a treat! The hotel's entrance is at 7th Avenue and 47th Street, right in the middle of Times Square, so you couldn't possibly be in a better location if this scene is your thing. A warning -- crowds can be severe in this area, as can be traffic. Definitely leave the car at home. Public transit is close by and surprisingly easy to use, so you don't really need a car anyway.At $500. a night, I can't say this hotel is great value, but to be fair this is New York in late fall when all decent hotels anywhere in midtown were similarly expensive. Fortunately for me, work was paying. The lobby of this hotel is on the third floor, and is not a fun happening place like some hotels. Also, their bar and restaurant on the 5th floor was utterly dead and uninteresting when I briefly checked it out. But this is Times Square, so there is no shortage of bars, restaurants, and entertainment nearby! Try the Blue Fin across 7th Avenue, where for one overpriced drink you get to watch Theater goers stream by by the thousands. This is one of the best people-watching spots I've ever found! I also love &quot;Swing 46&quot;, a bar/restaurant/swing dancing club with a live band nearly every night on 46th street between 8th and 9th avenues.Staff at the Doubletree was friendly, if distant. I didn't get &quot;warmth&quot;, just competence.The room was very clean and well maintained. This is a two-room suite layout, with a small refrigerator and coffee maker in the outer room, but no microwave or other cooking implements. The bedroom was charming, and with its view would have been seriously romantic had my wife been able to come on this trip. Bottom Line: If you get a competitive rate, stay here for the view and location. You won't be disappointed."
312,1791,"Nov 6 2007 	A Great Family Visit to NYC	We recently stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square during MEA weekend. This is when all of the schools close in Minnesota and everyone with kids flees to someplace else. The Doubletree was a great place to bring my kids. First, the rooms are all suites and are quite large, especially by New York standards. I'm a Hilton Hhonors Gold member, so breakfast in the hotel was free (otherwise, it would have been over $100 / day). The location is great for sightseeing as well. The hotel is in the heart of Times Square, a 5 minute walk to Rockefeller Center, three blocks from the subway, etc. Very close to everything with good transportation options.I would recommend this hotel for any tourist in NYC with or without kids."
313,1791,"Nov 5 2007 	It really depends on what is important to you.	Noisy location, very pricey, no view, good sized rooms. Overpriced."
314,1791,"Oct 18 2007 	Perfect for couple travelling with a teen!	Having read the reviews before going, I was skeptical, but we did not encounter any of the negatives I had read in other reviews. No stinky shower curtain, no defrosting fridge. The double elevator situation is odd, but never posed a problem. My wife and I took our fifteen year old niece on this trip so we were looking for a room like the Doubletree offers.We are Hilton Diamond members and were upgraded to a conference suite. It had a king in one room, a living area with sleeper sofa. And a conference/dining area with a table for 6. We tried and tried and could not get the sleeper sofa to unfold. We called for help, they said that in the conference suites the sofas don't unfold, so they brought up a roll-away twin bed, which was far more comfy than a sofa bed would have been. Times Square views were great and the black out curtains work perfectly. My wife and I prefer to stay downtown, and seldom spend much time in Times Square when we visit the city, but we figured since we were taking a teenager, why not? And it was perfect for her. She enjoyed the bright lights and hustle and bustle (she is from the country).Breakfast was included for us (Diamond Honor I guess) but it was not that great. The price is nearly $25 bucks, so if you have to pay for it, go somewhere else. If you get it free also, you might as well take advantage of it."
315,1791,"Oct 18 2007 	Great if you love hustle and bustle	We just stayed here; me, my husband and our 6 year old daughter. Couple of quick points: (1) if you want to be centrally located, in the heart of the Times Square action, and near subways, buses, etc. this was a great pick. You step out of a very subdued entrance into the energy of the city right away so don't stay here if you don't want to be in the middle of the action (2) Room/suite was wonderful. Our daughter slept on the sofa bed and had her own tv and we had our own bedroom. Both rooms have access to the bathroom. Room was very quiet and clean with nice toiletries. (3) Hotel itself is nothing fancy; no grand lobby but has a low key bar and restaurant (which we didn't eat at). (4) staff was very helpful. Concieges were able to give us good input and front desk staff were nice (even gave us extra cookies when we misplaced the ones we were given at check-in). Fellow outside got us a taxi anytime we needed one.All in all, a wonderful experience. We used Hilton Honors points so I don't know the going rate and how it stacks up against other midtown hotels but if you want to be in this area and want the extra space of a suite, I highly recommend the Doubletree Suites."
316,1791,Oct 13 2007 	Best Hilton in NYC	Over the years we have stayed in most Manhattan Hilton facilities. This one is tops. Very functional suite. Can invite friends over for a drink before going out. Comfortable. Just the right size. Super location for night life and dining. Very quiet considering it's location. Friendly competent staff. Safe environment. Will return in the future.
317,1791,"Oct 11 2007	Great Location	The location is right on 47th and Broadway. Convenient with the train stops. Walking distance to many theaters. We got the room ending in 01 and had a nice view. However, the 01 room is a little bit smaller but well worth it for the view of Times Square. Very near MTV studios, Toys R Us, and ESPN Zone."
318,1791,"Oct 9 2007 	Fantastic Location Briliant Accomodation	Just back from a trip to New York. Stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites. Room was great size by New York standards, very clean and fantastic to have a view over Times Square. The location couldn't have been better for tours (right across the street) shopping on 5th Ave and Madison Ave. Would highly recommend the DoubleTree"
319,1791,"Sep 28 2007 	Great location slow elevators	We stayed at the Doubletree for 3 nights with our teenage children. The bedroom had 2 double beds and the LR had a sofa bed. Modern, clean and location can't be beat if you want to be right in the middle of Times Square. Subway station on the corner. The room had great darkening curtains. We were on an upper floor and we could see the people walking up and down Times Square from the window, which was very cool. (we're country folks) Our only problem was that Columbia University Law graduates were doing massive interviews throughout the hotel and the &quot;blue suits&quot; were squeezed into every elevator during the day. Check in was VERY SLOW...we waited in line for about an hour to check in...at least they handed out bottled water to everyone in line!"
320,1791,"Sep 14 2007	Great hotel	What a fantastic hotel, great location and super views over times square from our 28th floor.Super size suite but sofa bed not that big but okay for kids.No free wireless in room can pay ! gym was good and all hotel staff helpful. I liked the idea that everyone had to show room card to enter hotel felt very safe.Straight out door onto Times Square but in room no sound could be heard great peaceful nights. Super fast lifts.As another review stated we found fridge was defrosting when arrived and shower curtain was smelley! but only minor things.We would stay again.Great place for breakfast round the corner called &quot;Evergreens&quot; we went there every day. Also use underground trains to get around 2 dollars for any trip."
321,1791,"Sep 11 2007 	Great hotel great location	Loved this hotel. Excellent location, very comfortable rooms, lots of space, perfect for business travel.Restaurant was so-so, but with so many alternatives within walking distance, it wasn't a problem.Service was great - a bit slow at times, but still very good.Would highly recommend &amp; would stay here again."
322,1791,"Sep 10 2007 	Clean Hotel - No views - Lacks conviences	Very expensive hotel at $350 and not worth it. Other expenses will add up as well. This hotel has no parking in the building and no in/out . We were told there was parking so we rented a car. Valet parking $45/per day or $35/ per day for self parking. I tipped the bellman to bring my bags up only to have them brought up to the third floor lobby where I would check in. Another bellman would take your bags to your room from there to for another tip. Forget about bringing the cart with your bags in it up to the room, the bellman told me I would have to take it out it is against hotel policy -and unprofitable. Buffet breakfast for three $48 plus tip. The business lounge is a rip off $10 for 5 minutes (bring your own laptop). I was told NY had a bed bug problem - not in this hotel it was clean and comfortable. Overall the hotel lacked hospitality and I felt like I was nickle and dimed to death. My suggestion wait for lower rates and stay at the Waldorf for the same price."
323,1791,"Sep 7 2007 	Great City..okay hotel	Having already been to NYC, my husband and I thought it would be fun to bring our 3 girls to NYC for a family vacation. When my husband and I went a few years ago we stayed at the Marriott Marquis which I will do again next time I go. Trying to save money we booked The Double Tree Suites this time. What they call a suite is tiny for five us although we were told we would be comfortable. We thought we could put our 9 and 12 year old daughters on the pull out couch to sleep...it was very uncomfortable! We ended up pulling the matress off of the pull out couch and put it on the floor for them to sleep. We were told we would get a suite with a view of Time Sqaure...what view?......I looked at an office building from my window for 5 days! Which was very disappointing since the view we had at The Marquis was fabulous...and my kids really missed out! Speaking of windows, they looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a very long time! The room as a whole was okay, clean just smaller than expected. The staff was okay and prompt when asked for extra things such as pillows."
324,1791,"Sep 6 2007 	Great HotelGreat location	IF you are looking for a great hotel that is in the middle of everything,look no further.This is an excellent location.Restaurants,theaters,etc are all in walking distance.I found all of the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The room was cleaned everyday and the warm chocolate chip cookie that we got on arrival was a nice surprise."
325,1791,"Sep 2 2007	Great location. Some minor disappointments.	The location is great. Upon arrival I notified the front desk that the refridgerator was defrosting with water on the bottom and the armoir door hinge was broken. These items were never attended to during our six night stay. The toilet was slow flushing. Shower curtain was smelly.Conceirge gave us directions 5 or 6 blocks in the wrong direction and we almost missed our day trip. Later I notified the conceirge of the correct location they were unconcerned and did not write down the address. So I won't use them again. Ask a stranger on the street they are more than glad to help. We tipped housekeeping every day and very disappointed that the shower, toilet and floor were not cleaned every day in fact, maybe not cleaned at all during our stay. The shower curtain was replaced however. Maybe this is the standard in NY city but not something we are accustomed to in any other place even the bungalows on the beach in Mexico are cleaned every day.We are HiltonHonors Gold Members and were offered complimentary buffet breakfast each day of our stay which was adequate to start our day. Egg chef was great."
326,1791,"Aug 30 2007 	Great Hotel For the price	Like many others, I booked our group using hotel wars. [--]It was all done by email and the rates and emails used were generic. We only need ten rooms but we still wanted a good rate. The Doubletree was awesome for location and I dont think that I will be lucky enough to get to go back at the price we got. In fairness, we did hear about this place from asianinbound.com or [--] which has some reviews for hotels that are &quot;tour friendly&quot; this hotel is not that tour friendly as is a hotel for real tourists who want to linger in the downtown hustle and bustle. The hotel was very well run and the front desk agent s and housekeeping almost always said hello each time. (which is a great sign). Loved it to the max."
327,1791,"Aug 28 2007 	Exceeded My Expectations!	We booked the Hilton Doubletree on Times Square not expecting the highest level of service and room accomodation, but boy were we wrong! On arrival at the reception desk we were pleasantly greeted and were informed that our room was ready and due to us being a Hilton Honours Gold member were immediately offered a free full house breakfest for the duration of our stay! We were also delighted with our room which was located on the top floor (43rd). On setting up my laptop in the suite I was also given free wireless internet access due to my gold membership with hilton! The views from our room were great, overlooking times square and the room itself was well presented with a coffee machine, microwave, minibar and safe. Having stayed at the W Hotel on times square which is also supurb but now having stayed at the Doubletree Suites I will definately return here or another Doubletree establishment. The only issues we had was queuing for breakfast in the morning but as it was holiday season this was understandable. Overall would recommend to any family wanting to stay in new york."
328,1791,"Aug 27 2007	Double the fun at Doubletree	It looked like this was going to be a bad review. It was my twin sister and I first time in New York.Our room was spacious, and the beds were heavely, but the room had a slight damp odor. When we came back we saw why. the air-conditioner had leaded in the room. They cleaned up the mess. We went out and came back again. Still an odor. Always speak up!We called the desk and they changed our room...to a room with a horrible view of an air condtioner unit. Complained, we were not paying this hotel price for such mess. They upgraded us to the conference suite! Nothing more to add. It was utterly amazing with a wrap around view of Times Square in this huge suite.It was a major plus for such a simple thing, but getting a freshly made warm chocolate chip cookie at check-in, or any time you requested, was such a treat.The only thing was the doorman/security and if he JUST saw you go in and out, he still insisted on seeing your hotel card to go in...they didn't even do that at the &quot;W&quot;."
329,1791,"Aug 27 2007 	Better than a Hotel room if you are a family	We are a family of two adults and one child and stayed for 4 nights in August 2007. The big plus of this hotel is the location, right on the corner of 47th and Broadway. This area is always busy with people and traffic but once you are in your suite you can't hear the noise. The location allows you to enjoy all the evening delights of Broadway and the theater district without the need to use taxi's or walking a few blocks at night. On entry to the hotel, the lobby which is actually on the third floor is not overwhelming but it is clean. If you are wanting a contemporary boutique hotel with a wow factor lobby then this isn't the place for you. Check-in staff were very efficient and our bags were delivered promptly to our room. Another major point is having two rooms, one room had a sofa bed which is ok for kids, and a small kitchen area with a sink, microwave and fridge. There was also a mini bar in the TV unit. If you don't need to, try not to use the mini bar as it is very expensive. Take a 10 min walk to the corner of 8th Ave and 48th to a grocery store and stock up on drinks and snacks and fill up your empty fridge. There was also a safe in the room. In short the suites and well equipped, clean and welcoming.The bathroom was clean and bright and accessible from both rooms and both bedrooms had a fully working TV with numerous channels.You could probably get a better hotel room for the price in the same area but if there is more than two in your party then this is definately the better option.I booked a Times Square view room but I would describe it as a partial view at best. The hotel serves breakfast in the restaurant which is either buffet style full or continental which for convenience we had three out of four mornings. The hotel also has a bar but it's not what you would describe as a destination bar.Once inside our room we found it quiet, there was no night noise of people coming and going and we always felt safe.The hotel can arrange theatre tickets but beware, they quoted us between $145-$165 per ticket for Mary Poppins at the New Amsterdam theatre. A quick trip to the box office on 42nd street and we managed to obtain them for half that price. Try all other options first before using the hotel.In summary, a very good quality hotel for tourists who are coming to New York and want to be at the heart of the action."
330,1791,"Aug 24 2007 	Perfect for families	The hotel is fantastic for the price and location. We had two Time Square view connecting rooms for 3 adults and 3 children, which gave us plenty of room. If I was only traveling with my husband I would stay at a more luxurious hotel around 5th and Park Ave. I couldn't have picked a better place being with children. We brought our nanny which gave us the flexibility to go out in the evening without the kids. We are platinum Hilton members so we got free breakfast for everyone each morning which was great. Check in was a breeze, the concierge was fabulous. We saw Legally Blonde which was playing next door. We took two girls ages 11 and 13. If you are conservative (which we are) this is not the show for girls that age! (too sexual) We enjoyed much better Beauty and the Beast. Across the street at the Marriott if you go to one of the top floors they have a restaurant which rotates with an absolutly fabulous view, we had cocktails up in the sky in the midst of a lightning storm which was amazing. Would stay there again ."
331,1791,"Aug 24 2007 	Great place to travel with teens!	This was our first trip to the Big Apple. The only thing we knew for sure was that we did NOT want to even attempt to drive in NYC, so we needed a location where all of the &quot;must sees&quot; were in walking distance. I scoured dozens of websites and visited TripAdvisor many times to check reviews, and kept coming back to this hotel. Initially I booked the room going thru AAA, but checked back with the hotel directly from time to time to see what their best direct rates were, and once their rate beat the AAA rate, I booked right through the hotel reservation desk. The rep was very helpful...she asked if we wanted a low or high room (we ended up on the 18th floor...just right.) She also told me that the best views would be a room facing north, looking out over the corner of Broadway and 47th, so that is where she placed us! I am telling you, this hotel is right smack in the middle of Times Square....you walk out the front door and you are in the action! We could really experience Times Square this way. We could easily walk to the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Macy's, Radio City Music Hall, NBC Studios, ABC studios, all of the Broadway show halls, Restaurant Row, St. Patrick's Cathedral, shopping on 5th Avenue, etc. The subway stop was right outside the front door, so we navigated this once to go down to Battery park (to catch the ferry to the Statue of LIberty and also to see Ground Zero, which is still a powerful sight after 5 years.) The beds are FABULOUS (if you are like me, that alone can make or break a hotel experience!) and since the rooms are all suites, there are 2 TV's (when you have teens who want to watch different shows, that is great!), a microwave, a fridge, and a safe. Of course, the rates are higher than what we are used to paying for up hotels here in North Dakota, but this is NYC so we knew that would be the case. If you are worried about safety, there are literally police on nearly every block....I never felt unsafe even when my daughter and I ventured out alone. The hotel room was also extremely quiet....none of the noise or lights from the street below were seen or heard once we closed the windows and drapes. I would highly recommend this hotel!"
332,1791,"Aug 23 2007 	Great Location	My hysband and 2 teen-aged sons stayed here for 3 nights. The location was great, better than the Hilton Times Square that we stayed at 2 years ago. The hotel was secure and clean. It was nice to have a suite and 2 TVs. There was a slight problem with our reservation and the hotel corrected it and threw in free buffet breakfast for the entire stay. We were very happy"
333,1791,"Aug 22 2007 	Great Place to Stay in NYC	Great place to stay in NYC. We were a family of 4 including two teenagers, who were in New York for their first time. The sofabed in the lounge was fine for them, while we grown ups enjoyed the privacy of our own bedroom with a very comfortable bed. I can't recognise some of the other reviews - the suite was very clean, modern and nice. I couldn't fault the maid service. The fridge was a great plus. The receptionists were delightful and very helpful, as was the concierge, directing us to the best place to buy i-pods. We had free local calls and wi fi which we found very useful. It wasn't cheap - which is why I wouldn't give it a 5 - but I was very happy in terms of value for money and would certainly go back.We used Grays open top bus tours based in Times Square and found them great and good value. We went on the downtown, uptown and night tours - all excellent. Although we HATE getting up in the morning, we managed to do so on the Sunday and used the subway across the street to travel down to catch the first ferry (8.30) to the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. No line/queue at all - even in August - and we walked straight on to the boat. When we got back we couldn't believe the length of the line/queue in Battery Park!! Cabs were cheap and easily available everywhere. Our highlight (sad to say, but maybe understandable after all the walking we did) was the 10 minute chinese massage available on Sat/Sun at the street markets on 6th and 7th. There was never a $20 better spent. Fantastic!!Before we went, I googled an internet site which gave me half price - and first class (3 rows from front in the stalls) - tickets to Les Miz which we all absolutely adored. The only problem is finding a table for a pre-theatre meal. My advice is to try to book in advance."
334,1791,"Aug 21 2007 	Great Place	We just got back from a four day trip and stayed 2 nights at Doubletree Time Square. The check-in was no problem. We got there at 11:00 a.m and the room wasn't ready but then we didn't expect it to be so early. They checked all our luggage and away we went. We we got back in about 6:00 p.m. they sent our luggage up and of course we got 4 hot cookies to take with us. We stayed on the 18th floor, and although we didn't have a view we weren't in our room much anyways. The rooms are spacious and CLEAN. If there were bedbugs they must have been asleep on the comfortable beds and pillows. The entrance is busy but that's to be expected where it's located. Loved that they checked for room key everytime we tried to go up. My 18 year old son couldn't even get up once after he went sightseeing without a key. Check-out was fast and they held out bags while we finished in NYC. Would definately stay here again."
335,1791,"Aug 20 2007 	Great central location if you want to be in the middle of it all!	I recently stayed at this Doubletree property for the second time, and I highly recommend it if you want to be in the middle of it all! My mom, who is a senior, accompanied me last year, but we were staying in a hotel closer to uptown. She had some trouble with all the walking so this year I booked us right in Times Square, and it was the perfect location for us! We had tickets to &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; which was right next door and also &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot; which was basically right across the street. We also used the hop-on and off tour buses, which are good for 48 hours, as our &quot;public transportation&quot;, and they boarded right across the street too! We were pleasantly surprised with our room since we happened to get a corner room with two views overlooking Times Square, and we love the suite set-up! The bed was extremely comfortable, and we were not disturbed by any noise from below. (We were on the 27th floor.) We wished they sold the chocolate chip cookies there! Too bad you only get them at check-in! (Heck - those cookies alone almost make it solely worth staying there!) We also really appreciate that you have to produce your key card to access the hotel itself. I generally feel safe when traveling, but you can never take too many precautions either. And yes, you do sometimes have to work your way through the crowd to get into the hotel, but again, if you want to be in the center of it all, then this hotel is a perfect choice!"
336,1791,"Aug 17 2007 	Strange hotel - but plenty of room and good location	Our family of 5 stayed August 4-8th. Strangest, most unimposing and unattentive check in desk/lobby area I've ever seen for such a large hotel in such a location. Also, a very backed up concierge. Fortunately, we had done our own research and didn't need their assistance!Rooms were certainly spacious. Separate bedroom and living room with closing doors was nice. But, I agree with several other readers that the rooms were also rather dirty (bathrooms especially) and showing signs of wear.The location can't be beat if you want to be in the center of things with quick subway access and a &quot;hub&quot; for walking to many of the great places in NYC.I also agree with many reviews that the rooms are very soundproof.Overall, for the price, I really think this hotel needs to class it up in the rooms, cleanliness and helpfulness."
337,1791,"Aug 14 2007 	Bed Bugs Galore	Stayed here for 3 days during the 1st week of Aug 2007, very noisy and extremely crowded, but good location.Shower curtain had mold and the smell was unbearable, it got replaced on 2nd day. Blood stains around toilet, but the worse thing was the bugs, our whole family got bitten and developed small infections on bite areas. Try to complain to on shift manager (Tito) but he had no time right now; security guard took some info but made us feel like we were the contributors to the problem. I have worked in the Health and Safety field for over 20 years and never seen such poor hygiene in any hotel. Service Hotel personnel was good and helpful at times. We had to discard our luggage to avoid bringing anything home. Warm cookies were a nice treat upon arrival."
338,1791,"Aug 13 2007	Nicer than I expected	The biggest downside of ths hotel is the location. I will qualify that remark by stating that I am not a newbie to the city, so the appeal of TImes Square is lost on me. However, since the entrance to the hotel is on a very busy corner (47th and 7th), you often have to fight your way through crowds to get in or out of the hotel. That's a slight bit annoying. Having said that, though, the room was clean and large by New York City standards. I was traveling with two teenage girls, and we had more than enough room for all of us, even after they had been shopping for 4 consecutive days. I have stayed in no less than ten NYC hotels in roughly the same price range, and aside from that entrance issue, the Doubletree is one of the better hotels I have stayed in for $400/nt."
339,1791,Aug 10 2007 	Great stay in NYC	We had a great stay - the suite accomodated our family with plenty of room especially for NYC. Room was clean and in nice condition. Service was quick and responsive. Location in Times Square was excellent.
340,1791,"Jul 31 2007 	Pricey but Roomy and Great Location	First of all, this hotel has real suites. I have been to other hotels where the name &quot;suite&quot; is used if there is a sofa/coffee table sitting area. Our suite had a separate, walled-in bedroom. I was traveling w/ my sister and her daughter. While looking for accommodations, I thought I would need two rooms because &quot;the girls,&quot; especially my 17 y.o. niece, would want privacy. As this was their first time to NY, I wanted a hotel right in the thick of it. In the theatre district during the high season ( July), it was difficult to find an acceptable 3-star hotel offering rooms under $200/nt. I was prepared to do one of two things: Get one decent-sized hotel room for 260/nt and tell them they would have to sacrifice privacy, or go down to a 2-star and rent two rooms.The Doubletree offered a compromise. It was almost $400/nt, but it was roomy. The sofa sleeper was comfortable. I can't vouch for every sofa in the hotel, but the one I slept on was great. It was big enough for 2 adults who don't mind getting cozy. Plus the cushions could make a bed for someone under 5 ft. When we closed the door to the bedroom, there was complete privacy for me and them. We each had our own t.v. I had the &quot;kitchen&quot; and they had the bath. Privacy was never a problem. Oh, and my sister wanted a smoking room. Some hotels are exclusively NON smoking. Our floor was a smoking floor, and you could tell, but I did not smell smoke anywhere else (and I am a non smoker). All in all, it fit the bill. It had location, quality, and lots of room."
341,1791,"Jul 31 2007	Perfect family lodging for NY!	Two teen girls and two adults just spent a weekend at the Doubletree and it was fabulous! The views from our room overlooking Times Square were just gorgeous and we were centrally located to shopping and access via subway to the city. The proximity to play tickets and theaters couldn't have been any better, and the location was simply great for us. No bedbugs, in fact...the bedding was as comfortable as any I've slept on. We had enough sinks for everyone for teeth brushing, etc. The security was good and the folks who worked there were really friendly. I would rate this very high as a hotel for families who want nice convenient lodging and don't mind the bustle of Times Square. We felt the hotel was very well priced for Manhattan and provided every courtesy and amenity we needed."
342,1791,Jul 30 2007 	Don't stay here my room was small and dirty.	The only thing good about this hotel are the cookies and the location. The staff was friendly but my room was not that clean and it was on the small side. The windows in this place were so dirty you could hardly see a view. The business center was so expensive that it was ridiculous! I won't be staying here again even if it was free.
343,1791,"Jul 30 2007 	Grat but no free internet as they said so	I stayed twice in this month and it has been a perfect room and very spacious and it suite looking through times sqaure, the first time I stayed I booked the Discover Downtown Package and stayed in room 2708 (looking to the screen that are on the Renaissance Hotel) and they gave me a gift card for Century 21 (a store and I never used it) coupond for a mall and many coupons.... I tought the internet was free (becuase other people had said so), but on my second stay I reserved the same room but as we checked in they asked us if we wanted a view and and if we wanted a high floor I said yes, they gave us room 3601 which was a big suite, i think it was called Conference suitre and it was bigger. And they gave us free wireless, beacse we were in executive floors. Yay!"
344,1791,"Jul 30 2007 	very pleased	We stay at the Doubletree from July 23-26. We were very impressed. Two adults and 3 children (6,8,9) stayed very comfortably in one room. We lucked into a room on the 42nd floor. Ocassionally we could hear other guests in the halls but we never heard the noise of Times Square. The two double beds were very comfortable. The sofa bed wasn't the greatest, but it was just a sofa bed. The little refrig and microwave were very handy for a lite bite to eat. Check in was painless. The entire process took less than 10 minutes. The concierege was well informed and always helpful.No real compliants, just a few minor issues: One tv remote did not work and never got fixed. We were only given decaf coffee in the room (although once requested, regular coffee was provided) and the nline to speak with the concierege did get long sometimes. Overall, we were very pleased and would not hesitate to return."
345,1791,Jul 29 2007 	Great Location Helpful Staff	The staff was very professional and helpful and the room was adequate for a suite hotel. Nothing special though.
346,1791,"Jul 27 2007 	Great for the whole family	I had a quick trip to NY with 3 teenagers and the Doubletree was perfect. Two very comfortable double beds and a pull out sofa, in a suite, so there was enough privacy and space for us all. The hotel was pretty quiet for Times Square and the a/c worked great on a hot night. The kids loved being in Times Square. I usually prefer the East side, but this was a great location for going to a show at MSG."
347,1791,"Jul 26 2007	happy at the Doubletree!	My husband and two sons stayed here last weekend and thought it was a GREAT oasis in the midst very busy (&amp; convenient!) TImes Square. They upgraded us when we got there to having a free breakfast buffet. The suite was very clean and comfortable and it was wonderful to have that extra room with children along. A great choice overall for a family trip! A reader from Madison, Misssissippi"
348,1791,"Jul 19 2007 	Excellent Stay - Will Go Back Again	We just returned from an extended weekend (6 days/5 nights) in NYC at the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square. What a great location -- subway right outside our door -- easy access to Times Square activities, restaurants, theaters. Room located on high floor provided excellent view of the City. Overall check in/check out excellent -- staff friendly, polite and willing to help out whenever/wherever needed. Room clean, spacious for family of four. We were able to move with ease throughout the City from shopping along Fifth Avenue to attending a Yankees game in the Bronx, to visiting Lower Manhattan, Statue of Liberty and the South Street Seaport area to traveling throughout several other great Manhattan neighborhoods. We saw everything we wanted to see in NYC and then some -- we only had (2) planned activities and we let the rest &quot;just happen&quot; and found that we had more fun and actually got involved with more with the City and its inhabiitants. There was actually more going on than we could ever attend. Check as many websites and order a New York Travel Guide before you go to help give you an idea of what's going on while you're there. Everywhere we went ,people were great -- very willing to help us out when we looked &quot;lost&quot; trying to find the right subway train -- once you get on it a few times you start to get the hang of how the lines work. Highly recommend getting a car service to take you to/from the airport (cheap -- spent roughly $35 per way for a town car with Carmel Limousine -- they also offered us $6 coupons on each stay by going to [-]. It made getting to the hotel and out of the city so much easier. Can't wait to go back."
349,1791,"Jul 13 2007 	i love doubletree- new york	Great suites, great staff, great location for theatres and shopping and the suites are perfect for families."
350,1791,"Jul 12 2007 	Worst Experience Ever	My family and I traveled to New York for some business and fun. We have stayed in Time Square every year for the past 10 years but have never stayed at the Double Tree. The morning after the first night my son(7 years old) woke up and had about 300 bites from sleeping on the sofa in the room. When we contacted the hotel staff...they immediatly tried to get us to sign a waiver to release them from liability. They then changed rooms for us. The next day when my son was all swollen from the bites I contacted the hotel to find out what the source of the bites were, etc. The accused me of bringing my son to their hotel in this condition. I will never stay at a Hilton Property again.I will upload photos of his bites later."
1,1801,"Nov 18 2009 	Very Happy Experience	I stayed in Enjoy Suites for 4 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment. We were delighted when we opened the door to see how big the apartment was. We were on the corner of the building too which was great as we had glass going right the way round the living area. Housekeeping knocked in every morning we were there to clean and supply fresh towels which i didn't expect every day but was great. Location wise the apartments were excellent. We walked almost everywhere. You are pretty much in the middle of things with the empire state only a few blocks away. Also when we arrived it was dark. We had heard there was a roof garden so we had to take a look. Its on the 24 floor i think. Wow, what a view.... pretty cool to have a great view of the New York sky line from the building you are staying in. Would much prefer the apartment we had in envoy suites to a hotel as have now done both. The only negative point I would have is one of us was sleeping on the pull out sofa bed and was the most uncomfortable sofa bed I've ever lay on. But in the bigger picture of things this didn't take too much from everything. Who needs sleep in New York anyway!!"
2,1801,"Nov 16 2009 	Huge Room in Manhattan	Usually a 3 star hotel in Manhattan means you'll have just enough room to get your bags in and maybe walk down one side of the bed to get in it. The Envoy on the other hand has huge suites. It felt like a 3 room apartment with a living room and a kitchen. It didn't feel old or run down either. Nice place, I would go there again in a heartbeat."
3,1801,"Nov 14 2009 	If you have a patient in NYU or great place to stay	My Mom had surgery at NYU and I wanted to be close. I was surprised what a wonderful suite i had. If you mention that you are the family of a patient there is a discount code you get to book your room. If I were in NYC for a visit the Envoy Club is a great, safe, quiet place to stay near many attractions. For the family of a patient is was G-d sent!"
4,1801,"Nov 11 2009 	Go somewhere else!	No internet service that works in the rooms. When I asked the concierge, who is very hard to get a hold of (let phone ring for 20 minutes once) instructed me to get hold of the internet service provider myself. The maids will wake you up every single day regardless of a do not disturb sign with a knock a doorbell ring to let you know that they are around to clean your room and if you don't let them clean it they won't be back to clean it later. The carpets are dirty as well as the wallpaper with stains and this is throughout the interior of building. There is only one concierge around during the day and at night you can leave a message on an answering machine that does not work which is not helpful to say the least. All of the lights in the room are energy saving so it's very dim lighting. For 200 bucks a night this is absolute robbery! Television has 20 channels."
5,1801,Oct 8 2009	Spacious bedroooms for NYC great kitchen	These are unrented apartments so they are much more spacious than a hotel room. We were traveling with children and adult friends so it was great to have so much room. We were on a budget so we were happy to find the kitchen fully equipped. I couldn't get over the size of our master suite. Although the carpets were worn and the wallpaper drab everything was clean. I hope we can book the Envoy Club for our next NYC trip.
6,1801,Sep 14 2009 	Terrific furnished apartments in the heart of Murray Hill	My wife &amp; I stayed 4 nights in total comfort. Rooftop deck (22 stories up) is amazing with views from East River to the Manhattan skyline. Large one bedroom suites (or 2 bedroom also) with 2 TV's &amp; all the comforts of home. We will surely become regular visitors.
7,1801,"Sep 9 2009 	Well.......stay only if you can't find anything else	Stayed for 3 night with our two small children. Had originally booked at the Affinia in a suite but when we changed out dates they didn't have anything available and in the same price range, for a suite, this was the only other place in the same price range. A suite was important to us so the kids had a seperate sleeping area.Location is good. Having a kitchen was a nice feature but we never ended up using it. Sofabed was horrible but fine for a 7 year old. Anyone older/heavier wouldn't be able to sleep comfortably as mattress springs poked through. We also had a rollaway and there was no space left. Bed in bedroom was comfortable but room and bed were tight.Bathroom was adequate but anything screwed into the wall was falling out - toilet paper holder, shower soap tray, towel rack, etc.However the room was dirty!!! Carpets and splatters allover the walls and even the air conditioner. Nothing that couldn't be cleaned off with a SOS pad and some Mr. Clean!!! No excuse if you ask me. Complained to the front desk and they couldn't have cared less. Asked to move rooms but they said they were fully booked. Also the safe is a big joke. Yes there is a safe and yes you can lock your things away. However it isn't attached to anything and ways around 10 pounds and can be easily picked up, tucked under your arm and taken away!!!!Wouldn't stay here again and wouldnt recommend to anyone else unless you really need a suite/apartment and there is nothing else availabe. Maybe we simply got what we paid for????Remember this is NOT a hotel. It is an apartment building. No services and no restaurants, etc."
8,1801,"Aug 17 2009 	This was the most disgustingly dirty place I have ever seen!	DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE MADE, FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO STAY!!!!!This place was disgusting. The carpets were filthy, there was holes in the walls and missing baseboards. The carpet was a different color close to the baseboards because it was so full of dirt and hair and debris. I took a swipe of the carpet about a foot long along the baseboard with a piece of toilet paper and came up with a quarter sized ball of gross filth. I took this down to the receptionist who was not at all helpful. They had nowhere to move us and said there was nothing they could do. There is never anyone around to help. No managers on site and the phone numbers you are given are conveniently never answered and no calls are ever returned. To top it off when we pulled the pull out sofa out to put our son to bed a dirty used band aid fell out and the sheets were all crumpled and had not been changed. We left in the morning and asked for a refund. We were charged for the full stay on our credit card and not issued any refund. There is a 48 hour cancellation policy and they did not even refund our night passed the 48 hour limit. I never did speak to a manager as they will not come to the phone. The worst hotel experience of our life!"
9,1801,"Aug 11 2009 	If you prefer a quite place to stay...this is it!	Stayed in 1 BR on the fourth floor which was newly refurbished and spacious. Very comfortable queen bed; teens (17 and 19) didn't complain about queen sleeper sofa. No traffic noises; quiet building; no loud parties, folks walking in the corridors at night. Great bathroom. Really no complaints. Didn't utilize kitchen; not enough glasses/plates, etc. but we just washed them by hand after each use. I loved going to the rooftop deck at night: the city views are awesome. M34 crosstown bus very convient; subway at 33rd and Park -- a short walk.Concierge staff were friendly and helpful, though not always at the desk. We were able to leave our luggage in the mailroom until check-in. We requested additional towels and pillows (the unit was stocked for 2 people, not four) which were provided a few hours later. Remember-- this is not a hotel and the service, though excellent, may take a bit longer. Fred promised to deliver towels and pillows before his shift ended and we returned after dinner to find the items in our unit, as promised.I will return again and recommend this place without reservation!"
10,1801,"Aug 8 2009 	Highly dissapointed	We stayed 3 days and nights.The place has been once decorated but now has very dirty carpets.We arrived and found bread pieces between the linens, TV didnt work and remote control had no batteries or cover.Nobody answered to these complains in three days.Would never go back, left my complaint in their answering machine while I was there and never worried to answer me."
11,1801,Aug 5 2009 	Descent hotel terrible attention to detail.	I'm here for 3 weeks. The wireless connection worked for one week even after daily complaints and assurances it was working fine. Receptionist answers the telephone one out of 5 times...voice mail the rest of the time. NEVER a return phone call. Soap for bath was replaced once. It seems like they're really not interested in the 'hotel' side of this condo unit.Less than satisfying experience. Would definitely recommend to friends again. Unfortunately we have 3 couples joining us for the weekend...3 more units rented....but not again. Too bad. Great potential.
12,1801,"Jul 16 2009 	Worse than awful	Do you consider a funtioning bathroom to be a basic amenity? If the answer is yes, do not even consider staying here.My mother was having open heart surgery at NYU Medical Center and my father wanted to be able to stay nearby and made a reservation at the Envoy Club. He asked repeatedly if there was a pull out sofa in the room in case another family member needed to stay as well. He was assured that there would be a sofa in the room.Well, no pull out sofa, no sofa at all. But most disturbing of all was the fact that the toilet stopped flushing and there was no one available to fix it! Ultimately, the staff of the private residences in the same building came to snake the toilet. I was told that there was no other room in the whole building that my father could have and that there was no way anyone could refund our money before morning if we were to leave.Oh, and did I mention that the phone in the room did not work properly either? And that the cot that was ultimately provided was no more than 65 inches long?All in all a disgusting way to treat any guest and that much worse that we were there to deal with a serious medical problem and all we needed were very basic services.Stay here at your own risk."
13,1801,"Jul 6 2009 	More than we expected!	What a pleasant surprise! We had a one bedroom apartment (sleeper sofa was also available to us, but we didn't need it!). Wanted to travel this way because it gave us more room than a hotel room and at a lower cost. It was just nice to have a living room area with a small kitchen and dining area space. Made it nice to unwind at the end of the day and have a place to socialize with our NYC family. The nearest subway station was approx. 5 blocks and a closer one would have been nicer, but overall, if you don't mind a little walk, this is the way to travel in NYC. This arrangement would be PERFECT for a family that wants to stay in NYC with a smaller pricetag!"
14,1801,"Jun 10 2009 	Great place to stay in Manhattan!!!	For less than the price of a hotel room, you get a studio apartment with a fully equipped kitchen. The rooms are clean, comfortable and more like a home-away-from-home than an impersonal hotel room."
15,1801,"Jun 9 2009 	Expect to be staying at an apartment	I think most of the disappointments noted by other travelers is that they may have expected a hotel. THE ENVOY CLUB IS NOT A HOTEL. It is much more like an apartment building with short term rentals and a few extra services to make your stay more enjoyable.We stayed at Envoy Club May 29-Jun 3 and absolutely loved it! We had a studio apartment and used the loveseat sofa bed for our daughter. (The bed was not that comfortable, but we were all dead tired each night.) The limited service provided clean towels each day and tidied up our kitchen for us. Our bed was also made. This service is optional, but we accepted it to get the clean towels.We loved the full kitchen, espeically for reheating wonderful restaurant meals which were just too much to eat at one sitting. Microwave popcorn was also handy. The bathroom was clean and well equipped with a great shower. Once we learned how to use the cross town M34 bus, the location was great. If you're only using the subway, the hike to the 6 is several blocks. The cross town bus is a breeze. High-speed internet (wi-fi) in the room worked perfectly.The rooftop deck is fantastic! Great views day and night. Didn't use the fitness room or the laundry. Great bagel shop around the corner and Rocky's on Second Ave for Pizza is excellent. I also enjoyed Ali Baba for Turkish food on 34th...a very short walk."
16,1801,"Apr 7 2009 	Bad Choice	We had extended family in 4 rooms, all types. The rooms are very large and that is great but the carpets are so terrible that you feel like the entire place is dirty. The carpets are stained badly and in terrible need of cleaning or replacing. Most of us used our shoes or double socks to walk around. I would not stay there again which is a shame because it would take so little to make the place a real bargain."
17,1801,"Apr 1 2009 	Service? What Service?	My boyfriend and I stayed at Envoy Club for 3 nights in March. I had called ahead 3 weeks prior to our arrival and requested early check-in... we got to the hotel at 915 am and there was no one at the front desk, the doorman said someone would be there ``soon`` (even though the hours posted stated that service personnel would be there at 9 am) a guy finally showed up around 930 and just looked at us and asked if we were checking out. I told him we were super early, but requested an early check - in and asked what time we could come back... he told us at around 2 our room would be ready (not 3 pm, the usual check in time) *not impressed* and then told us to leave our bags in the mail room... (anyone else find that a bit odd? leave all your belongings in an unlocked, unattended mail room?) So, we leave... have a wonderful day in the city... return to the hotel after 2 (maybe 210) ... room still not ready, come back at 230ish (so much for early check -in!!) When we actually got into our room, it was GORGEOUS! We had a studio and it was spacious, clean, and the bed was fantastic! Loved the kitchen and all the mirrors in the bathroom! Each day we went out, we requested the room be made up (having a full kitchen, garbage accumulated as we cooked all our meals in the room) Not once during our stay was the room made up. The final day, I called downstairs to the front desk and spoke to the guy who we dealt with on the first day... I asked why the room hadnt been made up at all and he told me housekeeping was still doing the rooms (this was 530 pm!!!) so I requested that SOMEONE come to our room to pick up the garbage and no one came... *VERY UNIMPRESSED* ...hence the title of my review.... SERVICE? WHAT SERVICE?"
18,1801,"Mar 27 2009 	Convenient Location- Good Price	I stayed at this extended stay location for a single night and was pleased with the accomodations and value. I had a large studio apartment witha full kitchen and decent work area. The property is an apartment building above floor 5, with &quot;hotel&quot; units on floors 2-5. There is a decent fitness center, a laundry facility, and even a small business center. Because of the nature of the property, the front desk is only staffed between 9:00 AM and 8:00 PM."
19,1801,"Mar 22 2009 	AAA+	Great staff ,....Super rooms ...,Great location......Great value"
20,1801,"Mar 13 2009 	Spectacular vacations in NY	We stayed in a lovely one bedroom apartment for 10 days, from Dec 26th till Jan 5th, 2009. It is so well located that we could go walking everywhere: Empire State, United Nations building, 5th Avenue shops. Subway is 3 blocks from Savoy Club and several bus lines pass 1 block from it. We had a wonderful experience in NY. It was the 1st time for me and my two teenagers. We had some frozen days but it was a pleasure when we arrive &quot;home&quot;. It was so heated that some times we had to turn off one of the heaters. The bedroom was very comfortable, charm and large. We used the sofa bed for my boy (17 years old) in the living room and it was perfect. Sara Azulay, the person I was in contact to make the reservations was extremely nice and answered me all my questions and doubts. Staff in the building helped us a lot. Surely we will stay there in our next visit to NY. I really recommed Savoy Club!!"
21,1801,"Mar 10 2009 	Excellent Experience	My boyfriend and I stayed in the Envoy Club's 2 bedroom suite during the last week of January, 2009. I was extremely satisfied with the Envoy Club. Fred helped us with check-in and was refreshingly courteous and helpful. The room was spectacular--not only clean but with nice furnishings and everything one could hope for for an extended stay: full refrigerator, microwave, stove, kitchen sink, etc etc.I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again on my next trip to New York."
22,1801,"Feb 23 2009 	Would definitely recommend.	We only needed one night and didn't want to spend a lot of money. My husband found this two bedroom apartment for $199. It fit our needs just right. The only downside to the room we had - 410 - was the cigarette smoke that seeped in from the other apartment. The master bedroom, bathroom, and closet reeked of it. So we were fortunate that there was another bedroom that was not affected by it. We were able to walk up to City Center for our show and walk to dinner too. Very convenient."
23,1801,"Jan 28 2009 	This Place Is A Jewel!	My stay on Friday 1/23/09 was absolutely wonderful. This place is a real jewel, with parking three doors down. It reminds me of hotels I stayed at in Europe in mixed purpose buildings where the hotel occupied several floors of a building with apartments and office space on other levels. With the kitchen, I could go to the local delicatessens for a dinner salad or breakfast, (I am on a special diet and it is hard to eat in restaurants), and it was right across the street from NYU where I was attending a forensics conference. Anyone who is going to an academic program there, visiting a medical student or resident, or is staying with a patient at the hospital, should really check this place out. I can't wait to stay again."
24,1801,"Dec 12 2008 	Efficient and comfortable residence	This is a real good choice for multinight stays. The Envoy Club rooms are surprisingly spacious, clean and well maintained. The staff work hard to please. I would definately return."
25,1801,"Nov 13 2008 	Good Accomodation/great location	I have just returned from a 4 night stay at the envoy club, 377 east 33rd street, new york. I was a little worried from previous reviews but was very happy on arrival as all the carpets were being replaced in the hallways which seemed to be what people who have written previous reviews had complaints about.The 1 bedroom apartment had a full kitchen with microwave,dishwasher and cooker, the living area has a double sofa bed and the double bedroom has tv and hairdryers.The hotel is in a great location just a a few blocks from the empire state building (on 33rd street and 5th ave) and grand central station.There is a fantastic delhi by the hotel which is great for breakfast and a cinema around the corner, times square is a 20 minute walk away.This is my second visit to new york and I would stay at this accomodation again."
26,1801,"Nov 12 2008 	Great place must have been upgraded!	I had made my reservations prior to reading trip advisor but I decided to keep reservations and give it a shot. A few things to note, the carpet in the hallways was BRAND NEW, with even the new carpet smell!The staff was friendly and courteous, assisting with all requests as needed. Big thanks to them for their assistance with directions. The apartment suite was spaceous with a Kitchen that was a generous size for a one bedroom apartment in NYC, with all appliances and items a kitchen would need. As I was in for business, it was great to be able to cook meals while i did my work in the apartment. (The wireless internet worked great and at a reasonable rate)I will be staying at the Envoy for all of my future needs, as I am working with a company right in the area."
27,1801,"Aug 19 2008 	Oh my GOSH this place is a disaster!	Oh my gosh! I don't know where those pictures come from on the web site and did the management right those lavish reviews but this place was a mess! I had to wear shoes to walk on the floor; the carpet had stains and mildew. The only thing was clean was the white linen, what a surprise. I had to put the extra sheets on the sofa in order to sit down. I paid about $400 for a 1 star room. I travel a lot and I never had this experience."
28,1801,"Aug 18 2008 	Good place when you need space plus privacy	Normally I stay at the Algonquin, Hilton, or the Blakely on W. 55th, but this time I was bringing my 16-year-old daughter and her friend for their first trip to the city. I looked at the option of booking two rooms next to each other in a regular hotel, but ended up choosing the Envoy Club, to be sure I could be in close proximity to the girls. We had a two-bedroom, two bath unit - the girls took one side and I had the other, with a living room and kitchen (standard &quot;condo&quot; sort) in between, so there was just as much privacy as if we had booked separate rooms, but had MUCH more space than two typical NY hotel rooms would have provided. The space was huge by NY standards. I do have to take issue with a few previous reviews, though - I couldn't classify this place as &quot;spotless&quot; but would give it a &quot;slightly better than just ok&quot; - meaning that I didn't feel I needed to scrub it down with my disinfectant wipes before using it - but it could have been considerably &quot;sparklier.&quot; The overall unit was fine, kitchen clean - yes, the furniture was a bit worn, but the bed was very nice, new-appearing linens, double-sheeted with generous sheets, quite clean and fresh.My only real complaint was the carpet - especially in the hallway and around the elevators. It is dreadful, smells of urine and absolutely must be replaced. The desk person asked me what I thought of the hotel when we checked out - and I did mention the carpets. He diplomatically agreed.Location was good. If you go out the front door and look to the right (2nd Ave) you can see a Dunkin Donuts and a Starbucks right there in sight, on the corner. Then just 5 blocks more and you're at Empire State, which of course is just across the street from Macy's....so walking into midtown is a cinch. We did take cabs back to the hotel though, after long days of walking and shopping....just not enough energy left. So you might want to factor a few cab fares into the hotel budget. Neighborhood is fine.I would recommend this hotel in situations where you need space plus privacy for a small group (esp. if there are minors involved) and if you want to save money using a kitchen (there are no services except housekeeping, no restaurant.) The two staff members I met were very nice. If they replaced the carpets, gave the rooms a bit more shine and polish, this place could be a 4-star. As it is I'd give it almost a 3. But I would go back if I was escorting kids again."
29,1801,"Apr 4 2008 	""We're Impressed!""	Katie and I are here for school vacation - her first time in NYC - and i figured all we really need is reasonably clean and quiet: anything more is a bonus. Happy to report that Envoy Club came through with flying colors. Our roomy 7th floor studio is perfect, in the back so very quiet, me on the double bed and Katie on the convertible. Mattress is 'firm', not my personal choice, but quite comfy. Fold-out is basic but K is very happy, especially after she commandeered my down comforter, leaving me a blanket. Wi-fi is $10. kitchen is well equipped, bath is superb, both are squeaky clean. Linens are Frette, crisp and new. Carpet and floors easily pass the Barefoot Test. Staff are very professional and helpful - good advice on local eateries, and when i told them about the toilet running and the smoke alarm beeping, both were repaired pronto.Envoy would be a 5 except for the location in Kip's Bay or Murray hill, i cant figure which. it is off the beaten track in lower midtown. We're walkers, but some might like to be closer to the action. on the other hand, it is very close to two of our new faves, 2nd Street Deli, with the best pastrami on the planet, between 3rd and Lex on E33rd, and LaSalle Ice Cream at 489 Third, where all is house-made by hand, and just superb - better than Italy. Try the Mango ice, or any of the gelatos - you won't believe they are low fat. Cheers!"
30,1801,"Mar 22 2008	What a great Place to Stay	We have just returned from New York and stayed at the Envoy Club. We were a bit nervous when we read some of the reviews after we booked and went there with an open mind. It was excellent! The staff were really helpful and the suite we stayed in was way above average for the price we payed. Would definately recommend it to anyone. The only thing that spoiled it was it was a good walk or a taxi ride to the main shopping areas of the city but on a good note you didnt get all the street noise in the evening which was great after a hard day of shopping!!! Very comfortable, very clean and great facilities in the room. Definately returning next year!!!!"
31,1801,"Mar 19 2008 	Basically satisfied with it	I was just up in NY for my daughter's wedding and needed to find something both reasonably priced and I needed a kitchenette for preparations, so my choices in NYC were limited by that. I am actually in the business or I probably never would've found this place, since I never heard of it before. All in all it suited my needs. I just needed the studio room but it was actually larger than I expected for NY and I was surprised that the kitchen was a full working kitchen, oven included not just the stovetop and microwave I'd expected, so that was a nice plus. Location was very good to anyone who wanted to be near midtown Manhattan-it's right off the FDR near NYC Medical Center and within walking distance to the everything. The main complaint, if I would call it that, was although I was only there for 2 nights and they do have housekeeping available, this was the only hotel I have ever stayed in that didn't leave an extra roll or two of toilet paper in the bathrooms and I literally ran out just as I was getting ready to check out. Maybe it was an oversight or maybe they have a rash of guests stealing toilet paper, but it was weird. And the other thing I would point out to anyone staying is this isn't an actual &quot;hotel&quot;, it's part of a condo unit and they only have the front desk available during the day until 8:30pm. I found out the next day that a family member had tried to call me at 9PM in the evening but there is no one to transfer the call and you only get a recording saying someone will contact you ASAP. I know most people these days have cell phones but I do not and had that been an emergency I would never have been reached at night. Just something to keep in mind if you don't have a cell. But it was a comfortable stay all in all."
32,1801,"Mar 9 2008 	Great Location at reasonable price	Apartments are a little dated but are large in size and as your in New York you'll only need the apartment for sleeping (beds are amazing by the way!). Some of the furniture could do with modernising but apart from that no complaints. great location, within walking distance of everything, near subway, empire state building and shops."
33,1801,"Jan 30 2008 	Great spacious apartment	We were very pleased with our accommodation at the Envoy. We stayed in NYC for 5 nights with our 3 year old son from 18 -23 Dec, 2007. We found that the location was a suitable walking distance to Empire State and the shopping. Our son was in a stroller and we enjoyed walking through the city looking at all the Christmas decorations. On a few occasions we caught a cab home (costing very little) after a long day out sightseeing in the city. We felt very safe in the area. There was a deli a few steps away with great food, as well as everything else you would need (restaurants, drug store and supermarket) close by. The fully equipped kitchen was awesome, bathroom clean and spacious. We loved having a separate bedroom with a huge king sized bed (very comfy). There was plenty of wardrobe space. The furniture was in good condition and the decor colors were brown/taupe. Very pleasing. Our son had a double bed sized fold out sofa in the main area which easily folded away each morning. Maid service was good. It was quite a large apartment and not the typical &quot;hotel' style all-in-one-room accommodation.The hotel hallway showed some stained carpet and the scent of cigarettes, but does not deter us from recommending the apartments. Our room was very comfortable and fresh. There was a mix up with the payment of the room. We had paid prior to arrival and had a voucher, but the front desk billed us again, after we left. This was very quickly sorted out within a few days when we notified them about the mistake. In actual fact, there was another person staying there with our surname and this mixed up the office. All good. Front desk was very helpful.It was the festive season and the concierge even gave a lovely gift to my son - &quot;Mack&quot; truck from the movie &quot;Cars&quot;. He loves it.Would recommend this hotel for families and groups of friends travelling together."
34,1801,"Jan 9 2008	Disappointing Envoy Club	Envoy Club Serviced Apartments, New York CityNew York was the last stop for our family on a month 'round the world' trip and the Envoy Club was the worst acomodation we stayed in even though it's price was higher than London and Paris for supposedly similar standard apartments. It's location on 33rd street was poor - the street is dark and gives the impression of being unsafe. Murray Hill district is neither uptown or downtown - very disappointing. It is 4 blocks to the subway and 3 blocks to a supermarket. The wireless internet did not work ,and it did not have a business centre available to guests.On arrival we had to get the cleaners to vacuum the carpet as it had not been done and the doona cover had not been changed from the former guests. The twin beds requested for our teenage children turned out to be a dodgy double sofabed. The central heating could not be altered unless you were prepared to put up with a very loud rattle. Our 4 towels were replaced with 3. The kitchen and bathroom were very clean but the kitchen had limited kitchenware. We would have done much better in everyway in a well situated hotel and eaten out."
35,1801,"Dec 6 2007 	Excellent choice	Just back after a 4 night stay at the Envoy. We were originally booked to stay at Radio City Apts but were changed to Envoy 'due to contractural reasons' so they said. But what a place, very spacious with great big king size bed and sofa bed was very comfortable. Apt was spotless and cleaned every day. Only problem was location though a quick hop in a yellow cab and you were right in the centre of everything. Don't let the location put you off. Would definitly return."
36,1801,Sep 17 2007	poor service drab appearence	I booked an apartment but the hotel had booked a studio as it was Labour Day weekend we accepted on condition compensation was made and a fold away bed was provided. Theadmin is terrible no attempt was made to compensate they have just been taken over and are not up to scratch. My travel co. GTA were great they got us moved to the 1 bed we booked and 1 extra night free without their efforts the Envoy Club would not help they do not care .This building is in need of a make over all rooms look shabby and tired
37,1801,"Jun 3 2007 	The Dogs Wotsits!	Just got back from staying at the Envoyclub apartments at 377 East 33RD ST New York , NY10016! Great location right in the heart of all the action, the room was great with everything that you would need for your stay! Clean, comfortable and spacious. Cleaners did a greatjob each day leaving the room spotless for our return!The staff at the desk were very helpful with directions and advice, and made the stay even more enjoyable!I would have no hesitation in recommending the EnvoyClub to other travellers and look forward to returning there in the the near future!p.s do the Liberty Helicopter Tour! best $140 I spent!What a view !!!"
38,1801,"May 3 2007 	great place to stay	our first trip to NYC. this place was great, clean, and comfortable. this is a great place to stay with the family. we are parents to two children and an infant and there was plenty of room for us. the kitchen was well equipped although we were to busy seeing the sights to do any cooking. we did buy breakfast items so we ate breakfast in the apartment each day.the bathroom was clean and spacious. we walked most of the time and found the apartment to be well located. there was a subway station and buses in easy walking distance.would stay here again."
39,1801,"Mar 22 2007 	Ideal for a family trip	An apartment in the Envoy Club is an ideal choice when travelling with a larger group. Just back from a 5 night stay for St Patricks with my family, 4 adults &amp; a teenager, and the Envoy Club provided excellent accomadation. About a 10 minute walk to Macy's makes it reasonably accessable however bear in mind when you want to get around to see everything New York seems huge when you've only few days in which to do it. The reviews here vary a lot &amp; personally I think people may be a little disillusioned by the pictures and descriptions of the apartments. Yes, they are fitted with the best of everything however it's all gone just a little shabby ... do not let this put you off if it's an apartment you're looking for as they are spottlessly clean and we actually found the staff to be very friendly. The kitchen is well equiped; beds comfortable; bathrooms large with great shower pressure and if its freezing cold, as it was during our visit, the heating system is fantastic. If you're in New York to shop you MUST visit Jersey Gardens www.jerseygardens.com. Take the 111 bus from the Port Authority building - approx 40 minute ride; fare approx $4.50 single (much better value than may $38 to get to Woodbury Common!). This mall is completly indoors with comfy couches so you sit and rest between shopping bursts. Remember as well that there is no extra tax added on to clothes prices in New Jersey as there is in Manhatten.Also, if you want to get a really good elevated view of Manhatten go to the top of the Rockerfeller Centre. Having spent hours queing for the Empire State on our last visit we tried The Top of the Rock this time and had NO queue at all and the view was much better."
40,1801,Mar 22 2007 	Loved it	Loved this place. Warm and cosy and only five min walk to Macys. Stayed in two bedroom and the only reason I haven't given it top marks is because when we first checked in we were given wrong apartment and had to be moved. But other than that perfect!
41,1801,"Mar 17 2007	not what i expected	Sorry folks, we booked through fleetwood travel and were promised 5 star accomodation. When we arrived we were very dissappointed but put it down to being tired. After a good nights sleep the place still wasn't what we expected from the reviews we read on this page. We were expecting a hotel not an apartment block with the smell of cooking in the corridors. The staff were also quite surly and gave us wrong information.We paid extra to be central but it was quite far out and taxi cabs were taken each evening to get back. We had a fantastic time in New York though and when we go back we will not be staying at the Envoy Club."
42,1801,"Nov 16 2006 	Home Away from Home	Having travelled fairly extensively, I was very impressed with the Envoy Club. There were 5 of us in a 2 bed 2 bath apartment on the 4th floor for 5 nights, which I'm sure is bigger than most New York apartments. Plenty of closet space and a large safe, not those pokey toy ones. I wanted to move in permanently.It was great to have somewhere where all 5 of us could spend time together rather than being in separate hotel rooms. The full kitchen was well appointed and well worth having. The furnishings were of a good standard and fairly up to date, the beds were very comfortable as was the sofa bed according to the designated sleeper. The bathrooms were clean and the showers had decent power. Location wise the hotel is well located only a few blocks from the Empire State Building and not to far from Macys. Being on 33rd, cabs were rarely more than $ 10.00 up or downtown. If you're getting a cab back get them to drop you on 33 and 2nd Ave, then walk to the Envoy Club, saves going round the block to the hotel door.Bedding is normally already made up in the sofa bed, you may have to ask for pillows though.There are loads of convenience stores, delis and a cinema near the Envoy Club. Also there are some great take out places, ask the front desk. I would have no problem recommending the Envoy Club to my clients. Overall the staff were great and helped out wherever possible. Big thanks to Gillian, we had a great stay.Minor Points:The rooms could do with a minor nip/tuck here and there, nothing major ie the window blinds need repairingCould do with having DVD players as VCR's a bit out of dateThe kitchen utensils could do with an upgrade and teaspoons would be good."
43,1801,"Nov 1 2006 	Fantastic Service	We have just returned having spent 5 days in the Envoy Club, having experienced excellent service and the highest standards of cleanliness. The staff arranged a late check in for our group, checked maps and even arranged transport to various shopping malls.The 1 bedroomed apartment was spotlessly clean and had everything you would expect to find in a full stocked house!The only downside was the location as it is a bit far from timnes square etc."
44,1801,"Nov 1 2006 	Great place to stay!!	Stayed in the Envoy Club apartments last week for five nights. We had a studio apartment that overlooked the street which wasn't really noisy. Even though we were across the street from NYU medical centre. The apartment was clean and had everything you need for your stay. A fully equiped kitchen with all mod cons and bathroom. There was a large tv, vcr, stereo and fax machine. You have your own private fax line and phone line. Details are given to you at reception. There is a maid service everyday. The staff were nice and helpful. We didn't need to contact them only to ask if we could stay in the room for an extra hour after check out which wasn't a problem plus we weren't charged for it. The envoy club apartments are on floors 3-7 and the rest of the building is eastbridge lodgings. There are separate elevators for envoy club guests. You can walk to empire state building, herald square etc and a cab is easy to hail. I would definately recommend the envoy club. I will be staying there again."
45,1801,"Jul 3 2006	Well worth the walk	Date 17th-24th June 2006My husband and I have just spent a week in New York and as it was our 35th wedding anniv and our 1st time to the USA we were worried about where to stay, Well we shouldn`t of because the Envoy Studio was great, not in the centre of things but we were able to walk to anywere we wanted or take the subway on 33rd Street. We were in room 505 and it was very clean and comfortable the towels were changed everyday and the maid came in every day , the receptionist were very helpful if you asked them anything and Jamile even sorted out transport back to JFK.We had trouble with the air-con leaking but just mentioned it and someone was summonded right away and when we returned it was sorted!!!. The bars and restaurants around were great and we spent a few night in Murphys, Ollie the barman is very funny. If you want a more trendy bar go to bar twelve At the end of very busy days we appreciated the location even more as we could get to sleep undisturbed and we were on the front. You had everything in the kitchen you needed if you chose to eat in. Ladies the hairdryer is kept in the cabinet in the bathroom I was looking all over the bedroom for one as even with an adaptor English electric items do not work.We took photos but wouldn`t be any different from photos already posted on site.Thoroughly recommend it if you want more space and freedom."
46,1801,"Jun 6 2006	Sshh! Don;t tell the world about this place or they'll all go!	My friend and I stayed here for five fabulous nights! The air conditioning worked very well, but if it hadnt we could have easily lived in the giant fridge. The rooms were spotless and the bathrooms actually looked like the one on the www (a rarity in my experience).The neighbourhood is very quiet and we both felt safe returning home late at night.The staff were really helpful and gave incredibly helpful local top tips and advice.I hope to return as soon as I can!"
47,1801,"Jun 2 2006	Mice in the Sofa Bed	Well need I say more, mice in the sofa bed and room.When we complained to the lady in reception, she said 'Its a city, expect mice' The previous review was descirbing the place in a nice way, and I agree, the place has obviously gone down hill big time. They have also changed the name to Eastbridge Logdings."
48,1801,"Jun 2 2006	Beware - You May Not End Up Staying Here	In February, a friend and I looked at the &quot;JustNewYorkHotels&quot; website. We found a hotel in West Manhattan which sounded OK, and tried to book. &quot;JustNewYorkHotels&quot; contacted us a day later and said it was full, but they suggested the Envoy Club. We read the reviews on the Trip Advisor website and it sounded great so we booked.All was fine until I arrived from London, hoping to meet my friend from New Zealand, at our apartment at the Envoy Club. We had been moved. He had gone to the Envoy Club and been told that 'Your Home International' - &quot;no longer have apartments available at the Envoy Club&quot;. We were moved - to an apartment on W70th Street. The first hassle was that the person who let us into the apartment warned us about a woman called &quot;Crazy Susan&quot; who lived on the 3rd floor who didn't like short term rentals in the building and was likely to harrass us if she came across us. We didn't but later in the week someone put a note through our door listing all the apartments, ours included, which were known to be let on a short term basis and asking residents to campaign against this. The building left quite a lot to be desired too. The smoke detectors either missing or hanging of the ceiling, a hole in the ceiling about 2 foot long, a wine bottle propping open the window in the corridor. The lift which kept breaking down.In addition we left about 5 messages on the customer service number we had been given and didn't get single response. Not even to the one left the day before we arrived which was to confirm that our booking was OK; or the one to mention that one set of keys didn't work; or more worryingly to let them know about the note under our door.To be completely fair, the apartment itself was nice, and in a good location, but the hassle and lack of customer service was annoying and really worrying.We have complained, but since we are going through JustNewYorkHotels and Your Home International it's taken a month to get a response from Your Home Int'l.I'm sure the Envoy Club is a lovely place to stay, but beware who you book your apartment through. You may not end up there."
49,1801,"May 11 2006	A not so happy return	After an excellent stay at this Midtown-East service apartment venue, we had a very disappointing second visit this April. We had booked a two bedroom, two bathroom apartment for a week which turned out to be a very dark place on the 4th floor of the building with a strong food smell in the corridor.We arrived at 2.20 and were told that ony at 3 we could check in which is ok and according to the rules of the game but neither do they have a proper place to store luggage nor do they have any other facilities like a toilet or a place to sit down. Not so nice when you arrive from a long-haul flight. Luckily, there is a Starbucks around the corner...The apartment is in need of a renovation. Carpets had big stains on them, the sofas and chairs had well used cushioning, the curtains in two rooms had partially fallen down, the dishwasher did not properly work and the safe in the bedroom was broken and could not be used. And for a place that could legally host 6 people, only two chairs at the dining table are for sure not enough. And like in so many other places, the batteries in the TV remote control were empty. The day we checked out, calls were made to the apartment to confirm that we were &quot;gone&quot; by 11 (which we were) and again, luggage had to be stored in an unsecured place. Reception is not very helpful and one can walk into the elevators without anybody taking note. So I wonder about the safety of the place.Sad to say that we will not return to this run-down place which once was such a good value."
50,1801,"Apr 20 2006	Great location	Just returned from 5 nights in New York (2 adults and 2 teenagers). We stayed at the Envoy Club Apartments - E33rd st Manhattan. We found the location to be very good - quiet and only 3 blocks from the Empire State Building and 2 blocks from the subway. Plenty of local eating places around the corner. Other major attractions are only 10 - 15 minute walk away - 5th avenue, times square etc..We had a one roomed apartment teenagers slept on the sofa bed.Apartment was clean and has full kitchen amenities (which we did not use), 2 TV's, plenty of wardrobe space ect. Our days were full and we returned late most nights. Area around 33rd st is safe. For apartment style accomodation in New York we could not fault..We booked apartment directly through their website."
51,1801,"Apr 9 2006	Good place at right price	Stayed in spacious 1 bedroom with excellent pullout in living room area; beautiful, fully-equipped kitchen, large bathroom and closet space. Everything was spotless and in perfect working order. Great for stay if you need to be close to NYU Medical Center. Found great Chinese restaurant around corner and plenty of window-shopping nearby.Would recommend to anyone who doesn't want to stay around Times Square, or vicinity. Pet friendly."
52,1801,"Apr 3 2006	Best Value in the City - We love it!	This was my second time staying at the Envoy and I still love it. The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious. The studio suite is about 600 Sq. Ft. and feels like the master suite in an upscale home. The windows actually open, which is a big deal to me. This is not the kind of place where you are waited on and served breakfast in bed. Speaking of the bed, it is quite comfortable. The bathroom is nicely appointed and the full kitchen is so much nicer than my own! I can't see how anyone could not like this place. I live in NYC and this is the only place where I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off by renting a closet for $200 a night."
53,1801,"Dec 15 2005	The Best	Having checked out every hotel in Manhattan(and I do mean EVERY HOTEL) we decided on THE ENVOY. We(four of us)had booked a one bedroom, and checked on our booking several times due to other reviews we had read on trip advisor. We were given a two bedroom at the same price(off to a great start) as there where no one bedrms when we arrived. The place was amazing, very clean, quiet, daily cleaning service(she must have hated our place, full of empty shopping bags)and laundry service if needed on the 3rd floor. Front desk staff where very helpful and polite and the doormen where great, friendly and helpful too. The place could have fitted 6-8 people very comportably. 2 bedrms, 2 bathrms, kitchen, large living rm, 3 T.V.'s, and closets everywhere!! We didn't use half of them! We had an amazing 5 nights of luxury. A straight walk up 33rd street and you are right at Macy's and shoppers paradise, close to some great eateries. Have to recommend Jack Dempseys(on 33rd between Broadway &amp; 5th) as the best for all kinds of food but especially the Buffullo Wings and Steak Tidbits(fab, fab, fab). We were a bit dubious having read some reports of The Envoy but can only rave about it, we will all be back again next year, same time, same place.From Lorraine in Donegal."
54,1801,"Nov 27 2005	Spectacular	Front desk was wonderful and very helpful. We don't go in for the &quot;snobbery&quot; of New York City and asked at the desk &quot;where do the locals go&quot;? Pleasantly surprised with the directions, suggestions, and the honesty of the staff. Being from the south, we are &quot;laid back&quot; and are quite appalled at the sometimes hectic mind-set of the north. These folks gave us a &quot;down-home feeling, our room was immaculant, and their suggestions were splendid--saving us a lot of $$$. The roof-top is the most romantic...recommend this place without any hesitation. Remember that it is not home. There could be problems, but we were well taken care of and EXTREMELY comfortable and satisfied. Would recommend to anyone who wants the relax in room and not feel like you are sitting on your suitcase. Neighborhood is safe and very friendly--IF YOU ARE. You get what you give. By the way, if you go, DO NOT MISS MCSORLEY'S BAR. Real down home feeling, great beer, greater food."
55,1801,"Nov 11 2005	Pleasantly surprised	When we booked our room on Hotel we were a bit worried. But when we got there we couldn't have been happier. We had a 1brm suite and the room was extremely clean and comfortable. The staff was very polite and accomodating, but not exactly the most knowledgable when we asked for directions or recommendations. The location was perfect for us and we were able to do a lot of walking because the weather was especially warm for early Nov. But cab rides were never more then 5-8$ to anywhere we wanted to go. I would highly recommend this place and would definitely book it again."
56,1801,"Oct 24 2005	Fantastic Living Space	First of all you have to consider whether you want a hotel room with people tending to your every need, or your own clean and well-stocked space from which to explore New York. The Envoy Club Hotel is perfect for the latter.We stayed for four nights in a one-bedroom apartment and frankly could have moved in for good! the facilities, cleanliness and decor were top notch including CD players, coffee perculator, giant bed, great shower/bathroom and 2 TVs. The service was on-hand which is all we expected and asked for. The reception people were helpful and went to great lengths to make my girlfriends birthday (and surprise engagement!) a very happy experience for the both of us.Location was a short walk past shops and restaurants to the subway, but quiet enough not to get disturbed by traffic or people on the streets. Plenty of taxis going past, and perfectly clean. The hotel is right next to the University Hospital as well but we never heard a sound even though we were on the front side.I don't understand the moaning messages on here, unless there was a particular moment of annoyance like the plumbing story -those things happen unfortunately and will ruin anyone's holiday. But 95% of people will absolutely love the Envoy Hotel and all it offers.New york itself was wonderful - get to Washington Square, grab yourself a helicopter ride, don't be a picture-snapping tourist at Ground Zero, and enjoy the largely positive nature of numerous different New Yorkers. We will go back, and we will definately stay at the Envoy hotel again."
57,1801,Sep 26 2005	Better than expected!!	Six of us stayed at the Envoy on Sept 23rd for a quick shopping trip. We booked the 2bd/2ba and it was better than we expected. The apartment was spacious and clean. The kitchen was new and spotless with marble tops. We were thrilled to say the least. The frontdesk was not as bad as people keep saying. They catered to all of our needs even holding our luggage for 8hrs after we checked out. I would definitely recommend it and stay again if we go back.
58,1801,"Aug 25 2005 	Very poor service response	I stayed at the Bridgestreet Envoy Club two (2) times in early and mid-2005. The first stay was pleasant; the suites were spacious and insulated from the noise of nearby parties. I am a professional woman and was staying alone in NYC on business. During my second (and final!) two-night stay, there was a plumbing problem that the management dealt with quite poorly. Throughout the first night, a gurgling noise had come from the septic system at sporadic intervals, without apparent reason. I notified the management, however no one came to check that day. On the 2nd night at approx. 2 AM, the toilet began gurgling very loudly and this time overflowing, again without reason (it had not been recently used). I reported the problem to a tape machine as no one was at the front desk.  I spent a couple of the &quot;wee hours&quot; awake, worrying that the entire one bedroom suite would be flooded as I was unable to turn the water off under the bowl. Around 7 AM, after falling into a much needed sleep there was a loud banging at my door. Emergently, a fellow rushed into the two-inch deep pool of water and rudely inquired as to what I had done to cause the problem. He and another fellow were in and out of my unit until approximately 9 AM repairing the tank and wiping water from the floor.I am obliged to shower and dress in professional garb by 9 AM in order to make work commitments; For nearly $250 a night -- I was unable to shower prior to starting my work day. Indeed I requested to the repair person that I be able to use another shower however he either did not understand or ignored my request, stating that he was almost finished. (No one answered at the front desk.) Unfortunately, I was exhausted throughout the day from an interrupted sleep.Sad to say, the service/responsiveness/courtesy at this property does not even compare with economy hotels I've stayed at. I've since stayed at several comparably priced hotel/suite complexes owned by Affinia and have been quite pleased with all aspects of their service."
59,1801,"Aug 16 2005	Really enjoyed it would stay again	My husband and I really enjoyed this hotel. I agree that the front desk staff was unprofessional (personal conversations in front of customers and a sort of clueless attitude) but they has no problem finding our reservation and it was quickly processed.The room was spacious, well equipped, nicely decorated, smelled fresh and was very clean. Definitely more than your average NYC room. It was also very quiet.The location (1st Avenue) is sort of out of the way, but right next to a bus stop, which we used to get to the subway. The bus runs down the length of 34th Street and was very convenient. We found the entire block to be very quiet for NYC and slept well both nights we were there.I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it."
60,1801,"Jul 22 2005	Don't Give It the Benefit	I have previously stayed at the Envoy Club and must agree it's going downhill fast.I booked a studio and confirmed the reservation and price by email. When booking in I was made to pay for a six night stay upfront for a higher price. After arguing about this for a good ten minutes, just what you need after a 20 hour flight, they adjusted it without acknowledging there error. They need to start thinking about replacing their desk staff and management. I'm being kind in calling them unprofessional.The first room stunk, had bathroom with cracked tiles, no personal safe although you could see where it used to be and a front door that was so loose it was unsafe. When I requested a room change it was treated like a real effort to agree.The new room wasn't much better - mutiple stains on the carpets and sofas, shonky TV reception, no bathroom kits etc.Where eighteen months ago I recommended this place (on TripAdvisor) now I would not give it the benefit of a doubt. It isn't worth the hassles you have to go through."
61,1801,"May 6 2005	Hmmmm	Well what can i say, the apartments are very spacious and clean ( the carpets need a serious overhaul ). The bathroom was lovely and clean. But the hallway to a ''non smoking'' floor smelt of stale cigs... you know the smell.... the room has everything you could poss need.... cd player/video player ( who uses videos these days ). The big downsides are the staff on the ''front desk'' they totally suck !!! No idea of customer services ... actually unreal. The location is a headache as being in midtown you would have thought you'd find a subway stn within a couple of mins walk.....errrr no ! try 15 mins away, its quickerjumpin in a cab to your destination. The area around it is nice and peaceful(ish) not very new york, actually it feels quite ''suburban'' in a starnge way. The apts are designed for business people who want a kitchen etc etc but if your going to ny on hols then i would stay somewhere else so u can really experience the new york atmosphere around your hotel ..... good luck !!! email me if you got anymore questions."
62,1801,"May 2 2005	Excellent value good location nice apart-hotel	We stayed at the Envoy Club for 7 nights from 14th to 20th April 2005. After reading one of the more recent reviews on the website we were a little worried before we checked in, however we were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of our accommodation. We had booked a studio room, and although we didn't get an upgrade like other guests, the room was more than adequate for our needs. The service we'd had from Envoy Club when booking the room and with follow up queries was very prompt and friendly. I had found a special rate on Expedia for 3 of the 5 nights we booked and emailed them to ask if they could match it as I always prefer to book direct with the hotel. They matched the rate, and when I confirmed my booking, extended it for the whole 5 nights - we paid $179 per night plus taxes (for Brits, that worked out at around 100 per night).The lobby is small, but you have to remember this is not a hotel - it is an apartment block, and Envoy Club own the first 3 or 4 floors of apartments that they rent out to guests on a short term basis. There are no normal hotel facilities, such as a bar or restaurant or large lounge or lobby - if this is important to you don't stay here. There is a fitness room, business centre and laundry, but we didn't use these so can't comment on them. The receptionist was a little scary at first, but we were super friendly to her and her mood brightened. Two days into our stay we decided that NY was so great that we were going to have to stay an extra couple of days. The receptionist accommodated us with no fuss and even let us keep the special rate we were paying for the extra 2 nights. By the end of our stay we were getting tips from her on where to go, and she was teasing us about the amount of shopping we were doing - so all in all friendly service.The room was large by any standard, and as I understand it, particularly for New York. It was all very clean, and our sheets were fine! it was fairly stylishly done, but not over the top modern. There were 2 large windows in the room and it didn't feel too closed in.We had a queen size bed (the receptionist was worried this wouldn't be big enough for my 6'2&quot; other half, but it was fine), a small sofa, a small dining table and 2 chairs. There was cable TV, a VCR and CD player. There were two large cupboards (closets) one was a walk-in which was great and gave us loads of storage space. The kitchen was great, although we didn't use it other than to make coffee and keep milk in the refrigerator. If you were staying for longer though it had all the equipment you'd need to make simple meals - oven, hob, microwave, pots and pans etc - they all look fairly clean.The bathroom was also a good size, it took us a while to work out the temperature control for the shower, but we got there eventually - and very clean, with plenty of towels.We got maid service every day (sometimes a she was little too keen, wanting to come in and clean before we'd left for the day) so the place was always spotless, including the maid cleaning our coffee cups and coffee pot every day.The location is pretty good, although a little out of the main action. It's about 4 crosstown blocks to the subway (about 10 - 15 min walk at an easy pace) and 5 blocks to the Empire State Building. There are a couple of good bars nearby, plenty of pharmacies, convenience stores and delis. We were grateful for the more peaceful location at the end of a busy day, as we had no street or outside noise in our room at all (but we were at the back).My only gripes (and pretty minor ones at that) - there was no way we could find to adjust the air-con. The weather when we were there was positively summer like 70-80 degrees, so it didn't matter too much, but we might have been cold if it were cooler outside. Also the air-con was quite noisy. The other gripe - no full length mirror! How strange in a hotel!I would have no hesitation recommending this place to anyone who isn't that worried about the full on hotel atmosphere, and wants to stay in a quieter neighbourhood."
63,1801,"Mar 23 2005	Apartment hotel	We arrived Envoyclub in mid-March 05. First you pay your entire stay at check in. Then you have your room. Missing key charge is 70$. Envoy should inform at room description that queen bed has only one large blanket for two persons to sleep. This might encounter inconvenience when sharing room with same gender or your spouse. Fitted carpet was bit shabby. Plenty of room for you belongings. Separate dressing room and wardrobe. In kitchen the dishes were fine, but one boiler was rusty. Others were okay. Gas stove. Dishwasher has seen its better days... it was brown inside but did its job well. Detergent included. We liked space in studio 550 square feet (50 m2). Room was also very quiet. Only cleaning time (9-15 depending if maid was nearby) had some noise. There is airconditioning and windows cannot be opened. The ventilation in bathroom was poor. This is a big minus for stay. After using toilet, you get all smells into room... one inch opening under the door. We used 0.99$ air freshener after &quot;session&quot;.Electronic safe box didnt work. Hotel staff just did nothing to that or just couldnt. They gave us next day safelocker from desk. As Europeans we didnt mind 700m walk to 33. Street metrostation. Or 1 km to ESB. There are many small restaurants near hotel and one liqueur shop kept by chinese with good service. Conlusion from this hotel: we rate Envoyclub three minus ***-. Hotel staff *. They didnt even say &quot;Bye&quot; when checking out. We got impression, that reception had better things to do like chatting in internet and going out many times than to just be available, friendly and serve guests. It doesnt take much to do that. Room cleaning ****. Room basic amenities (no body lotion) ***. Dishes ****. Hotel location ***.Our opinion is that in Envoyclub we got better value (149$ booked five months advance) than f.ex. same priced basic ** -hotel without breakfast, without spacious room and without kitchen."
64,1801,"Mar 16 2005 	Amazing!!	We just returned from our trip to NY with our two year old in tow and I cannot stop gushing about this hotel. It could not have been more perfect. I read the review from March 5th and all I can say is that we must have gotten a revamped room because there was nothing run down about what we experienced. The decor was stylish and very clean, the sheets were new, the kitchen even had marble counters. We had a one bedroom and it was surprisingly large, perfect for a couple with a child. The staff was very friendly and helpful, calling to be sure we were in our room and all was fine, and assisting with directions and restaurant recommendations. The location is very central with everything you need just outside the door. Two grocery stores, bagels, pizza, sandwiches, pubs, and much more. I am a frequent business traveler and I'm comfortable recommending this hotel to anyone ~ it surpassed my expectations, especially due to the incredibly low rate. We will be returning to NY later this year and we will most definitely staying at the Envoy."
65,1801,"Mar 15 2005	A great value in a forgotten corner of NYC	If you're looking for personal service and tons of amenities, then Envoy Club is not for you. BUT, if you're looking for a luxurious yet very reasonably priced accommodation, then look at Envoy Club. My fiance and I stayed there this past weekend and had an excellent experience. First, we were upgraded from a studio to a one bedroom at no extra charge. When we went up to our 5th floor room, we were amazed by the APARTMENT that we found when we opened the door. Yes, I said APARTMENT -- not the teeny-tiny closets that pass for hotel rooms in other parts of the city. This space had a living room with a couch and two chairs, a dining table, a large galley kitchen, and a good-sized bedroom by NYC standards. There was a TV and VCR in the living room and a TV in the bedroom. The apartment was tastefully decorated and the kitchen had dishes, pots, pans, etc, so you could cook in if you wanted. Everything was very clean and the towels were the best I've ever seen at any hotel. Only small downsides were that the sheets were a little frayed at the edges and they left only one robe instead of two. The room was also one of the most quiet places I've ever stayed in NYC. The only noises I heard were other tenants opening and closing their doors. Check-in and check-out were a breeze (unlike some of the larger hotels where it can be a nightmare). The only real drawback to the Envoy Club is the location. The closest subway is at Park Avenue (hotel is at 33rd and 1st) and there aren't many tourist attractions nearby. Plus, it's sometimes difficult to hail a cab in this area at off-hours. So, we did a LOT of walking which was good to burn off all the delicious food we ate during our stay! Thumbs up for Envoy Club!"
66,1801,"Mar 5 2005 	Going going downhill!	I have stayed several times here in the last year and it keeps getting worse on each visit. My most recent visit in January was my last. Every time I have checked in I have been greeted by a staffer who was busier with their own personal phone calls, friends visiting, food deliveries, eating, reading magazines, etc., to provide a decent greeting, but this last time took the cake! The desk clerk could not be bothered to TURN AROUND and greet me for several MINUTES, speaking to me while seated reading a magazine with their back to me. Is there no management on premise? I have never seen any! Every simple request is typically greeted with NO and bad attitude and if you call downstairs for anything from the room, half the time the phone will ring and ring with no answer! One visit, on a weekday evening while I was trying to get some sleep before a big meeting, a dog next door barked continually, but nothing could be done and the dog yapped for hours into the night because the front desk clerk was gone at 10pm! One of the the desk clerks can also be seen in the evenings slumping in a chair in the lobby complaining loudly about having to work ... Lovely ambience for a hotel. The rooms were once quite nice, but now all the carpeting is stained or has holes and bleached splotches on every floor, both in the hallways which are now a bit dank and soiled and uninviting as well as in the rooms. The toilets either fail to flush or overflow it seems on every other visit. They now even post a warning about it rather than fix the problem! The showers NEVER drain, leaving the tub almost overflowing by the end of your shower. The AC units lately do not work very well, sometimes not at all. Every room I have stayed in has a definite smoky smell, even when it is supposed to be a non-smoking room. The &quot;Frette&quot; linens are not, and they are in TATTERS. Sincerely, the sheets put on the bed are ripped and torn and frayed. The maid and management must know this, but if they allow the front desk clerks to be as rude as they are, they just do not care! The rooms are large, I have stayed in the studios and one bedrooms, but they are generally not cleaned very well and lately look quite grimy. It is just not worth it to stay here anymore regardless of the room size. This hotel has seen better days and is going down the tubes unless it freshens up and hires more professional staff."
67,1801,"Feb 13 2005	Best kept secret	One of the best kept secrets in New York City is the Envoy Club. I took my husband there in January for a combo dance and comedy weekend in NY. He likes to dance and I like the comedy so we were going to Carolines and out dancing two nights in a row and we needed somewhere to recuperate both days (Thursday &amp; Friday). I did my research for days before and came up with the Envoy Club on E 31 and First Ave. It was perfect!!! It is not just a hotel- it is a home away from home. The apartment - that's right apartment- was fully equipped with kitchen (everything in it), wonderful walk-in closets and a great bathroom. As it happens, it rained the next morning of the first day there and the room came with a huge umbrella. Did I mention that the hotel is on several floors within a business and residential building so you feel right into the neighborhood. They have an exercise room on the floor that I stayed on, too. I don't know if this is the usual, but I have stayed everywhere from Canada to Florida and this was the best place for the price I have ever stayed. I could not believe the reasonable price they charged. I am sure that the next time we plan to have a partying weekend or just a break away, it will be there."
68,1801,"Nov 16 2004	Traveller's Worst Nightmare--Homelessness	My husband and I recently visited New York City to support a friend who was running in the marathon. Of course, this is one of the busiest weekends in the city and almost every decent hotel was booked. About one month prior to the trip, we reserved a room at the Envoy Club for the weekend. When we arrived late on a Friday night, we were told that someone moved our reservation to the following Monday through Thrusday instead of Friday through Monday. I guess we were lucky that we even caught the front desk clerk...as she was about to head home for the night and leave the check in desk unattended-don't know what we would've done then. Needless to say, I had received no notification of the reservation change (since it was handwritten in pencil on the &quot;computerized print out&quot;) and had both my hotel web page and email confirmations in hand. Besides, if we had made a change, would we be standing there? The hotel had booked someone in our place...so the hotel was full. We then knew what homelessness felt like. We thought our first night in New York would be spent on a bench in Grand Central Station. After about an hour and a half of calling other hotels, the Envoy Club did finally find us a hotel about 5 blocks away. They only had a smoking room, but at this point, we would take anything. The Envoy Club agreed to pay the rate difference (only verbally--refused to put this in writing). After a call to the new hotel, I was comforted the rates would be taken care of. Finally, at 2:30 am, we checked into a hotel...smokey or not, we had a bed on Park Avenue. Unfortuantely, by check out on Monday morning, the rate difference still had not been resolved with the Envoy Club. After a few heated calls to the Envoy Club Management, the bill was resolved and I thought our Envoy Club nightmare was over. Now, one week later a receive another confirmation from the Enovy Club as a reminder of my upcoming stay. This place just can't get it right. I really hope that we're cancelled!This was a horrible first experience for a stay in New York. I definitely recommend sticking with the &quot;Name Brand&quot; hotels if possible for a visit to such a big place...or at least avoid this hotel with all you've got!"

1,1806,Review of the fitzpatrick manhattan	After reading a few reviews on here I decided to share my opinion. This was my 2nd time staying at the fitzpatrick manhattan and the good remained good and the mediocre remained mediocre. The bad part of the stay was once again with the desk. While some of the agents were good It was the same girl giving us attitude on our first stay repeating it the second time. We were put in a regular room when we were suppose to have two beds in a suite and all she would say is that we would have to pay extra for it if I couldn't find my confirmation. I explained to her that I had forgotten it and she said there was nothing she could do. I had to speak to the reservation manager and explained to her that I had just booked 5 rooms with her and one of the rooms was suppose to be a 2 bed suite. In about a minute she said it was a mistake on the hotels end and she apologised and everything was fixed.We had started our trip on a bad note but that was the only problem we had.The positive note on our stay besides the brilliant rooms was the concierge Michael who booked us 3 shows and a few restaurants for us not including the loads of times he guided us to the right places. He made our stay excellent both times we were here and always did it with a smile. The bar staff were also great especially David who was always great. The new specials they have at The Fitz is lighter on the wallet. I will be back in a few months and hope to see the good stay good and the bad become good.
2,1806,"Great value and perfect location	I'm just back from a 5 night stay here. I don't usually write hotel reviews but I think this one really deserves a mention. Got a great value deal, was expecting a small room but had a huge one with 2 double beds for 2 people. Very little noise and nice and cool in the room. The staff were lovely and the location is perfect (5 mins walk from the subway at 59th street) Didn't use the restaurant (why would you when you're in New York?!) If you can get a good bargain here I don't think you could do much better."
3,1806,"Nov 12 2009 	Great location but that's it	This hotel was a disappointment from start to end. Our room was small and cramped and you could barely move in the bathroom. The rooms have been upgraded but you can literally see the layers of paint. The hotel was aware that there were three of us staying in the room but, despite many requests, they only supplied us with two of everything  very annoying when you ask for an extra set three days in a row and are ignored. The service was not good. From other reviews it seems that guests who have stayed in suites seem to fare better. We ate in the bar/restaurant a few times. It is dark, a bit 80s and full of tvs. Breakfast was a stodgy Irish fry up  not even a good one at that  and the meals were pretty average. We popped in there this year when staying elsewhere to have the Shepherds Pie (which was the only dish we liked) and I found a hair in my food  not great! The best point is the location on Lexington. However the Waldorf=Astoria, where we stayed this year, is an even better location and it is surprisingly cheaper than Fitzpatricks! This hotel is overpriced and underwhelming."
4,1806,"Nov 9 2009 	Luxury Charm Hospitality and Location!	My wife and I booked the de Valera suite for our 25th wedding anniversary trip to NYC. Upon arrival we could tell we made a good choice as the staff was very welcoming and the suite was spectacular. The bedroom was wonderful, the bathroom was floor to ceiling Italian Marble and everything worked perfectly. We had a drink in the very lively Fitz Bar before heading out for dinner based on the recommendation of the staff. Bici, an upscale Italian bistro was excellent. Throughout the stay we utilized the staff for recommendations and reservations which they handled with ease, and were critical, especially for the very busy Sunday Brunch at Rue 57. The location of the Fitzpatrick Manhattan has got to be one of the best in Midtown. We walked everywhere as it is much faster than a taxi, as the traffic, even on weekends, is quite congested. If youre in good shape (my wife and I are both 50) you can easily walk all the way to Macys (34th and 7th), the Theater District (we walked back to the hotel at midnight, after a show and dinner) and Bloomingdales, Trump Tower, Tiffanys and The Plaza are just blocks away.For the same money as youll pay at other hotels that havent been renovated in ages, you can stay at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan and experience true luxury, charm and their signature Irish Hospitality. Highly recommended!"
5,1806,"Oct 19 2009 	Great location and even better staff	On a recent holiday to NYC we decided to stay at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan - the hotel location on the corner of 57th and Lexington is hard to beat - shop weary partners can be dispatched to the uber trendy and buzzing hotel bar for a break allowing their other halves to escape to adjacent Bloomingdales or the many other nearby 5th Ave shopping meccas. We had a suite which was very spacious by New York hotel standards and was serviced several times daily - lovely bathroom, very comfortable king sized bed and a seperate sitting room and joy of joys windows which actually opened in all rooms!! (I'm not a fan of the US obsession with central air conditioning).Where this hotel really wins however is with its staff - they are without exception friendly, helpful and prepared to go that extra mile to make sure that your stay is memorable.We will be back!!!"
6,1806,"Sep 27 2009 	Thank You to the Fitzpatrick Staff	My daughter and I discovered the Fitzpatrick here on Trip Advisor. We had an incredible stay in Manhattan at the Fitzpatrick thanks to the kind, caring, thoughtful, friendly staff and management of the hotel. We decided to make a connection with all of the staff to try and make their days a little brighter and we found the staff going out of their way to make our stay in New York a memorable one. Merima got us wonderfully settled in and her enthusiasm, positive energy, greetings every day, and great suggestion for a place to have breakfast (Fresh and Co.) were much appreciated. Mike and Ray were incredibly helpful, friendly, professional and knowledgeable every day. Simon is a great young manager and is a joy to talk with. We didn't meet the owner but we sure appreciated the welcome messages and &quot;touches&quot; of friendliness that his hotel and staff portrayed.Thanks to one and all at the Fitzpatrick and we hope to see you again and we know that our family and friends will be visiting you as well."
7,1806,"Sep 18 2009 	Adequate bland hotel in midtown	This hotel was fine -- I am rating it three stars because I found it to be extremely average. The location is pretty good -- East part of mid-town. Lexington is a pretty charmless street, but 3d and 2d Streets are nearby if you want to be in more of a neighborhood, and it's also within relatively close walking distances to 5th Avenue. As for the hotel itself, I had a one room suite, on the 8th floor, that I stayed in for four nights (price $399 per night not including tax).This was a perfectly decent business option. It is not a modern or stylish place. The furniture in the room was quite bland and charmless, but the suite was large (with a sleeping room and a separate livivng area, and tiny &quot;kitchenette&quot;). The kitchette had a fridge in it, and a coffee maker -- but nothing else (i.e., no microwave, utensils, plates). So if you want to use it as a mini-kitchen it's not equipped to do much. The room was clean when I arrived and continued to be cleaned well. It was equipped with everything you'd expect (nice toiletries, blowerdryer, iron, bathrobes). Toiletries were replenished, which I like. There was free access to a mid-range sports club down the street, which was a decent gym. No newspapers delivered to the room, although you could sometimes snag one in the lobby. The room had two flat screen TVs, both of which worked fine, and an ipod docking station.The lobby was very small (a couch along one wall was the main seating area) and smelled a bit musty. Not a place where you'd like to spend much time. The staff was average, not mean or rude, but not too warm and welcoming either. My only real complaint was with the restaurant. I've seldom had such poor service: (a) water not served, even though I requested it twice; (2) coffee served w/o cream; (c) oatmeal came without the raisins I ordered, and none came until I requested them twice. I only ate there once after this."
8,1806,Sep 10 2009 	i wont stay here again	I stayed here on part of my honeymoon in August '09 and we have stayed in a hotel as bad.When booking we requested a suite only to be told when we were checking in that all the suites were gone. We got a small poky room with 2 lights that were out of order. When we cam back later that evening our key cards would not work. The porter tried to blame us saying we had the cards near something magnetic. the following morning after complaining to the day manager we got moved to a bigger room - he offered us a suite for 1 night. Not much use when we had 3 more nights there. That evening when my wife was having a shower the towel she was using ripped almost in half as she dried herself. Then when she was drying her hair a fuse blew in the room and we were left in total darkness. We rang down to reception and the manager came up stinking of cigarette smoke and tried to blame us for the problem !THEN that same evening when we came back the lock on our door had completely jammed up. Another call to reception and the maintenance man came up to fix it.We complained quiet profusely at this stage and we got 2 drinks and breakfast vouchers.for what we paid to stay here it was no where near worth the money The 2 positives I would take form our stay were both the bell boys were excellent and the Breakfast was very nice in the bar !
9,1806,Aug 18 2009 	Very nice Great location	This was a nice hotel for Manhattan. The room was really clean and very quiet a big plus in NYC. Our room had a proper shower ( not just a shower in the tub ) which was really nice. I would stay here again.
10,1806,"Aug 14 2009 	Disappointing hotel but a great location	I booked this hotel for 2 nights as part of a treat for myself and my girlfriend as we were going to stay with friends for the rest of our trip. Being Irish we have all heard of Fiztpatricks. When I got the hotel, I was a bit surprised. It wasn't like I'd imagined it to be. After a long sign in procedure we went to our room. I went to the room and just felt disappointed. I thought we would have a spacious room but instead it was very very cramped. The bed itself was VERY comfortable but we both had to wear ear plugs as there appears to be no sound insulation. If someone knocked on a door nearby, it sounded like our door and you could hear people walking outside the room, never mind when the maid was cleaning. We had no view, just looked at a wall of the next building so we didnt have much natural light either. It just wasn't at all like I thought it would be. I found the staff quiet standoffish, 1 female staff member in particular seemed to have little interest in interacting with the guests. There was no Irish feel to their attitude. It tries hard to be an Irish hotel (almost a little over the top) with pictures of the president and a few other well known Irish people but it just didn't do too much for me. It looked a bit like the kind of place my parents might stay.We decided not to eat in the hotel as there are too many places nearby to try so I cannot comment on that. We paid alot for what we got, probably the worst value I have ever gotten from a hotel itself. What did save our stay though was the location. You are walking distance from many attractions which is fantastic as our friends live way uptown and we had gotten used to subwaying it everywhere so it was great to be able to walk to where we wanted to go and it is in a very nice part of town. I'm not too sorry I stayed but I would not stay again nor would I recommend it to a friend. There are better value hotels with better rooms. Sorry Fitzpatricks but I just felt disappointed."
11,1806,"Aug 8 2009 	Margaret Farrelly knows good Hotels	I have stayed in both The Fitzpatrick, Grand Central and ManhattanThey are both truly great hotels, in a big city like New York it is so difficult to get that personal touchSean Fitzpatrick has more than managed this in both of his properties--they really caregreat locations--perfect restaurants--friendly staff and a personalised letter from him after you leave--are we in Dublin or New York-- I love it and will return! Booking is so easy with Deirdre from Sunway Travel--flights etc arranged with such ease--everything you aked for or could wish for is done!! After many mistakes this is my way to go to NY which I do several times a year to visit my daughter who works there!!"
12,1806,"Aug 8 2009 	Great Location actually clean and updated. Solid 'A'	We try to come to NYC once a year or so and stay at different hotels. (mostly boutiques) Thanks to TripAdvisor user photos we turned down the W's and decided on the Fitzpaterick Manhatten. It was close to the park, close to Rockefeller and close to all the stores. Arrival: I had forgotten to call for an early check-in until we were at baggage claim in Laguardia. I called from there, and the hotel rep was very nice and said they could accommodate our request. This hotel is easy for cabs to find and easy to catch a cab from the second you walk out the door. Check in was brief, pleasant and no problems whatsoever. Room: A LOT of hotels we have stayed in here claim to be updated and modern and most of them (just read TripAdvisor) seem to have corners cut, bugs here and there, dirt, mold etc. Let face it, NYC is old (for America) and you get a lot of old hotels that slap a coat of paint and/or a some new furniture and call it 'renovated.' I can honestly say this room was the cleanest room we've stayed in here. The bathroom, the bed, the furniture, all very nice, new and clean! No musty, dusty, moldy, or buggy experiences here. -- The amenities were good: Flat panel TV, ipod compatible clock radio, big closet, pants press mounted to the wall and nice furniture. The second set of 'black-out' drapes were awesome for sleeping. As far as room size, I would say it is bigger than your standard NYC boutique room, but smaller than the rooms in large old hotels. There is reasonably fast internet access available for $15/day. We had no problems with checkout."
13,1806,"Jul 27 2009 	Excellent friendly central boutique style hotel	Excellent staff who were only too willing to help at any time. The room was fabelous, spacious and had only been recently upgraded to, in my view at leasr 4 star standard as was the rest of the hotel. The hotel is well located close to Bloomingdales and all the other major stores. Dont forget to get your discount cards from reception! The restaurant / bar were very warm and friendly, like being in your own lounge, with good food and service."
14,1806,"Jul 25 2009 	Home away from Home	After a long trip from Australia we were greeted with friendly efficiency which continued through our ten day holiday. Our suite was clean and elegant, the beds comfortable, great amenities in room (loved fresh bottled water with turndown service), perfect location between the Museums, Central Park and the madness of Times Square and Boradway. Other hotels may have similar offerings but it is the staff at the Fitz that make it a home away from home. No matter what our request they responded immediately and it wasn't just the Irish staff that were fun and pleasant to deal with. Coming back to the Fitz after long days sightseeing was a highlight of our holiday."
15,1806,"Jun 24 2009 	Very nice	We were originally booked at the Fitzpatrick Grand Central, which called to tell us they were oversold and would book us at their sister hotel with an upgrade to a suite. What we got was a (not &quot;the&quot;, as there are several of them) Presidential Suite, and it was very very nice- probably the nicest accommodations we'll ever be able to afford in New York. Staff was very attentive."
16,1806,Jun 5 2009 	most overrated hotel i ever stayed in	as for $85 for a dressing gown i wouldnt have taken it if it was free. no maid service in 4days. a/c broken on cold. dirty and stained upholstry and carpets.wont be rushing back!
17,1806,May 18 2009 	Excellent NYC Stay	We recently stayed here for one night and found the accommodations excellent. Our room was very spacious and clean and had 2 flat screen tvs. It's very near Central Park in a decent area and it has a great restaurant and bar downstairs.
18,1806,"May 14 2009 	We'll be back!	We had a great experience from the minute we walked through the hotel doors through the time we left four days later (at 5am in the morning). The staff was very accommodating. We arrived in a rental car and were able to park the car in front of the hotel while we checked in. That was a big relief considering we never would have found a parking spot along the street otherwise. We arrived before the official check-in time so our suite wasn't quite ready. They set us up in the lounge area with free drink coupons. Our room was ready before we finished our drink. The room was very clean, spacious and quiet. The bed and pillows were incredibly soft and comfortable. They quickly catered to our needs when we requested wine glasses, a cork screw and plates to be brought up to our room. The French toiletries were also wonderful. I loved the olive soap. We'll definitely stay there again (plus it's located within walking distance of just about everything we wanted to do)."
19,1806,"May 6 2009 	Perfect Stay	Great Hotel, nice rooms. Staff are friendly. Hotel bar &amp; restaurant were very nice. Will definately return."
20,1806,"Apr 28 2009 	Great location decent value rooms; too bad the service is horrible.	In brief: After prepaying for the room and confirming our reservation by phone only 2 hours prior to arrival, we were told that there was no room available. There were no pleasantries offered such as &quot;Welcome, how was your trip?&quot; and &quot;There seems to be a problem, let me discuss it with my manager so that we can find a solution&quot; but rather &quot;Name&quot; and then &quot;We will have to book into another hotel since we have no rooms for you&quot;. Of course we did not accept that solution and miraculously they found a room for us. The rooms were quite nice, other than dust, a broken lamp and an incredibly uncomfortable and broken sofa bed - it was fine. The morning of our departure, there was a terrible flood in the lobby with tiny pots everywhere to collect the water dripping from the ceiling. During the check out process, the staff was again a bit rude. I would not recommend this hotel for your trip to NYC. You can do better in midtown."
21,1806,"Apr 21 2009 	Great find in NYC!	Great location. Very helpful and polite staff. They very graciously helped us with our late night check-in. Rooms are clean, functional, and well-appointed. Rooms included a quality blow dryer (not the usual hotel kind), mini fridge (very useful), separate sink/bar, and bathrobe. Basically, the place had a lot of room amenities you would not expect from a NYC hotel. Didn't get the chance to dine at the restaurant, but the food looked smelled delicious."
22,1806,"Apr 14 2009 	Great stay lovely hotel convenient location	We stayed here over the Easter weekend. The room was very comfortable, the staff were all very helpful and friendly, the location was very convenient for walking to many places, it's also very close to the subway."
23,1806,"Apr 12 2009 	Perfect location	Location could not be better - the real bonus of this hotel. A few blocks to subway, walking distance of 5th Ave, Central park, Macys etc. Refurbished rooms very nice, although the view from ours was not great. Staff very attentive and polite though the lady who checked us out Saturday let the side down. She was snotty, rude and mannerless. All the other staff though made up for her, particularly the doormen and concierge who could not have been more accommodating.All in all a great hotel. Will return."
24,1806,"Mar 24 2009 	Excellent Choice for NYC	Excellent Choice. A very nice small hotel on Lexington near 57th st. Close to Shopping, Museums and 2 street blocks from a Subway station at 59th &amp; Lexington. The Rooms were very clean and the staff was friendly. We had a Bedroom Suite which had 2 rooms and 2 flat screen televisions which was perfect for traveling with Teenagers. The cost of the 5 nights was less than staying at the large chain hotels in Times square and we had a lot more space! Only ate at the restaurant once but had the Irish Breakfast and it was excellent and recommended. Would definitely stay here again on future trips to NYC."
25,1806,"Mar 22 2009 	Great location great hotel	My sister and I stayed here for a long week-end, sans husbands and children. We wanted to do some shopping, sightseeing and visit museum mile. The hotel was ideally placed for all of this and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff are helpful and don't make you feel as if you must tip them everytime they smile at you. The restaurant does a great breakfast and is nice for an evening when you are too tired after a day of shopping to venture out. The room are comfortable and of a reaonable size."
26,1806,Mar 4 2009 	Perfect for Xmas Shopping	Although the  wasn't so strong we got a great deal in NYC with this hotel and continental airways.The Hotel is easy to find and although the reception is small it is intimate. Nice bar and small restaurant.Most of the staff are irish which makes you feel welcome and the room shave just been refurbished. Rooms are compact but well appointed with contemporary furnishings.Lovely walkinshowers.Very handy for bloomingdales the staff also have gift certificates for the store.A pleasant stay!
27,1806,Feb 26 2009 	Fantastic Fitzpatricks Hotel manhattan	This has got to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. First time in New york and I think I picked the best hotel there. The staff were so nice and friendly. The room was perfect. We had a king suite. Plenty of room. The suite had a very large tv in the sittingroom and a smaller tv in the bedroom. Quite a bit of street noise but we did not mind. It just added to the New York experience. There are other rooms available on request. These have no street view but are very quiet. The bed was so comfortable. Perfect location on 57th St and Lexington Ave. Great shopping area. Underground only 2 blocks walk from hotel. I am very fussy about my hotels and this was even better than I thought it would be. The perfect hotel in the perfect city.
28,1806,Feb 2 2009 	Great hotel for NYC!	We celebrated the week of our 20th wedding anniversary in NYC. The Fitzpatrick Manhattan hotel was truly accomodating in helping us to make the time in the city as comfortable as possible. From the time we walked in the staff was there to cater to our wishes and help us to have a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
29,1806,"Jan 30 2009 	Great Hotel and location	It was my first time in NYC in 7 years and I was quite unsure where to stay. A friend reccommended the hotel and I am thankful to him for that. In short- the staff are helpful, the rooms are nice and the locations is BRILLIANT. All the shops and shows are only minutes walk from your door and the subway is only two blocks away."
30,1806,Jan 7 2009 	Nice Hotel - Friendly People	I Stayed at the Fitzpatrick for 4 nights and it was a very friendly hotel and a great location. I was traveling around a bit and it was not far from the subway. Carol in the bar was great and made me feel at home. The room was a descent size and very comfortable. I would definately go back to the Fitzpatrick given the choice and if I were staying elsewhere I would definately pop my head in the bar to see Carol!
31,1806,"Jan 1 2009 	my new favorite NYC hotel	My wife and I recently spent 5 days at the Fitzpatrick based on our travel agent's recomendation. We usually stay nearer to Times Square but I had business meetings to attend on the upper east side and the subway local #6 station is on Lexington Avenue only 3 blocks from the hotel. We got a king suite for about the same price as we usually pay for a nice king room near Times Square. The room was very spacious, clean, and nicely appointed. We were on the 16th floor facing Lexington Ave and my only complaint was street noise. When I go back, I may ask for a rear facing room. Service was good and the adjoining restaurant was a pleasant surprise. The location was perfect; easy subway access, in the middle of great shopping and still close enough to the theater district to walk. Overall, it was a very good experience."
32,1806,"Dec 9 2008 	Best Address in Town	I was a little bit cautious with some of the reviews on site, it was a workmate who said I couldnt go wrong - we had late arrival and I have to say the staff were lovely, booked standard room it had everything - even if the TV was positioned at a very odd hard to see angle and I have to say the bathroom was tiny - but with one of the best showers I've seen in any hotel. The huge factor in this hotel is that you are simply in the heart of everything- a short walk about 10 mins takes you the corner of 5th Ave to Tiffanys- Central Park is about 15 mins walk - and its just beside Bloomingdales Department store if you can afford it. Didnt partake of the breakfast in the hotel mainly because it was like taking breakfast in any Irish Hotel, went to the local diners very cheap, great athmosphere. Metro nearby to take you to Ground Zero and Wall St , althought only used the bar once while there and there was in fairness a great athmosphere in it, the reception staff were fantastic - including the bell captian , we were particulary grateful to them for arranging a car to JFK on the return as it was the Eve of Thanksgiving and none of the yellow cabs wanted to go to JFKGreat City - Great Hotel!"
33,1806,"Dec 8 2008	Highly recommend Irish breakfast	Highly recommend the Irish or American breakfast at the Fitzpatrick. Beautiful cafe with excellent service. Excellent food, great tea. Wonderful experience."
34,1806,Nov 18 2008	Tiny Tiny Rooms	Location great..Rooms tiny &amp; to be honest hotel well over rated!!
35,1806,"Nov 17 2008 	the best	What can i say about fitzpatricks, it is class, class, class. Excellent staff. Concierge Geraldine couldn't have been nicer. Without her our stay in new york wouldn't have been so good, she recommended great bars and restaurants. Bar staff were very friendly and you felt like staying there all night, cosmopolitans were fantastic. we were upgraded to a suite and it was a real treat, rooms were clean and housekeeping never called too early to annoy your sleep in. Next time i go back i'll be staying here, it is a little bit more expensive but well worth it."
36,1806,Nov 11 2008 	high price to pay	rooms clean but very small for the price we had to pay.booked online ended up paying much more than was quoted.even got charged $42 for 2 people for a small breakfastwe wont be going back
37,1806,"Nov 11 2008 	Can recommend the cosmopolitans	Just back from 4 nights in Fitzpatricks...been to NYC 5 times and each time had booked a standard room in one of the usual suspects. This time, with relatives, paid a bit more for a 2 room suite (to sleep 3). I couldn't recommend Fitzpatrick's enough - comfy beds, great staff, lovely food and drinks, helpful and a real home away from home. Never again will I stay somewhere else"
38,1806,Oct 16 2008 	Recommend Fitzpatrick Manhattan	This was our first stay in a Fitzpatrick hotel in New York and hopefully will be the first of many. All staff were friendly and we were very looked after by all. Reception staff were most welcoming and very friendly at all times. Concierge was most helpful and obliging. Housekeeping staff are to be commended. We were upgraded to a suite and enjoyed the luxury. Toiletries were excellent and were replaced whenever required. Great tea/coffee making facilities. Would definitely recommend the turn-down service -one of the best in any hotel. Will definitely stay here again on any return to New York.
39,1806,Oct 10 2008	Great Stay	Every year we come and stay at the Fitzpatrick and it was a great stay once again! They just finished the renovations and while we miss the bar the new lobby looks fab!We stayed for 4 nights and we are always treated great whenever we come and stay here from David and Mike who are always willing to help us whenever we needed it. Cant wait to come back next year!
40,1806,"Sep 16 2008	Relaxation in Manhattan	Great location for walking or public transport. Midtown East. Personable staff, several languages spoken. Very comfortable room for 3 -- separate bedroom with sofabed. My teenager said it was the best sofabed she has ever slept on. Rates on various internet sites were quite high, but AAA website gave us a good rate. Hotel staff said we could probably have gotten the same or better rate just by calling the hotel directly. We slept well here. We were at the back of the hotel, so fairly quiet. Nice touches, such as turning down the beds in the evening. The restaurant, The Fitz, serves good food and all the UK favorites, but, as with most hotel restaurants, higher prices than a diner. Continental breakfast is included. Internet access is an additional fee. There was construction on the lobby at the time, but there was never a bother with noise or inconvenience."
41,1806,"Sep 14 2008 	Repeat visitor	Just back from our 6th stay at Fitzpatrick's. Reception area under renovation so willing to give them the benefit of the doubt regarding service at reception. Great location to stay with many attractions and shops within walking distance. Must admit new bar has lost all the charm and charter of previous visits despite all the efforts of Carol and the rest of the bar staff. NO ATMOSPHERE unlike previous visits. Drink prices at the bar have increased since our last visit and can be even dearer if you don't buy directly at the bar yourself. However, rooms and room service excellent. We discovered a few new gems on our last visit. Dinner at the Harbour Lights restaurant at SeaPort overlooking Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges (ask for Helen from Ballyhaunis). If your in to pizzas then Lombardis on Bleeker Street, Soho where you cannot book or pay using credit cards but well worth the queue.If outlet shopping is your thing (teenager and Hollister) then visit Staten Island mall. Get the free ferry across and a local bus. On your return there is a direct bus from the main bus station to Manhattan 57th Street (X31/X51)"

43,1806,"Jul 19 2008 	Quiet clean modern and helpfull	The Fitzpatrick Hotel is in a great location, a short distance from Broadway, Central Park and the museum district. The rooms are spaceous, modern, quiet and amazingly airy and comfortable (best nights sleep we had in weeks). The staff arranged for us to have an early check-in because our flight arrived at 8am and allowed us a late check-out at no extra cost. This was the best city hotel we have stayed in."
44,1806,"Jul 6 2008 	enjoyed our stay	We were very pleased with this hotel. We had a suite, which worked out perfectly since we were travelling with our three children. The room was clean and new (great) but there was a lot of street noise (not so great). The location is good, within easy walking distance to Rockefeller Plaza and Central Park."
45,1806,"Jun 9 2008 	Great location	We stayed (2 girls) at the fitzpatrick in March 2008 for 9 days, great location close to everything felt very safe coming and going from this hotel, had seen post about poor breakfast we didn't find this at all, the pancakes were to die for mmm. only had one evening meal which was good also. staff were very helpfull at all times."
46,1806,Jun 6 2008 	Excellent Stay	This was the first time we came to New York and our stay at the Fitzpatrick couldn't have been better! Our travel agent booked our car from the hotel and the service was excellent! We arrived around noonish to the hotel and was assisted by Mike the bell captain who for the rest of our stay assisted us with all our questions and got us Broadway tickets at a very cheap price! He was really kind and funny with the kids. The room was a suite and it was nearly perfect. The one flaw of the room was the AC was not working and it was really hot the day we arrived. The house lady did a great job with the room as well.There are so many stores near the hotel. We bought so many things from the Apple Store and Central Park is about 10 minutes from the hotel. There are great restaurants around the hotel as well. We ate at the Palace Restaurant and they have an excellent breakfast at a great price! I would defenetly stay at the Fitzpatrick again and just to let you all know who reads this they are going to stay renovations very soon in the lobby.
47,1806,"May 25 2008 	Great location good rooms	Stayed here over Christmas 2007. The location is really good, just a few blocks from Central Park and the posh shops on 5th Avenue. Our rooms were fine, clean and well appointed. They had recently refurbished the bar...the bartender was a bit of a plastic paddy though.One tip: if you're staying over Christmas, don't have dinner on Christams day....way too expensive ($80) for what you get."
48,1806,"May 7 2008 	fantastic stay	My wife and I have just returned from a three night stay at the fitzpatrick Manahattan and cannot speak highly enough about this hotel. I booked the hotel on fitzpatricks toll free number and was greeted by a very friendly lady who gave me lots of information about the hotel and its facilities. The ocassion for my visit to NY was our tenth wedding aniversary and the hotel pulled out all the stops to may us fell welcome. We were upgraded to a suite which was beautiful, antique furniture, plasma screens, lush carpets, a very comfortable bed and a marble bathroom. The real joy of the Fitzpatrick Manhattan is the staff, they are very well trained and make you feel very welcome. The location of the hotel is very central, just a few blocks from the crysler building and st patricks catheral. NY is such a fast and busy city however the fitzpatrick is an oasis of calm in a desert of chaos. I shall not be looking for another hotel when I return to NY.Ray ReidyGalwayIreland"
49,1806,"Apr 30 2008	Nice Stay	First time stay at the fitzpatrick and it was a good experience. Check in was quick and pleasant and they gave us a upgrade just for the asking. We had a suite which was perfect because my party had 3 people. The room was fairly large for NY standards, conservative decor which we were ok with. The King size bed was very comfortable, however it was a short matress so our feet hung over. The air conditioning worked well in our room also. The bathroom was small but it was a very nice brown marble and the shower had very good water pressure. The front desk was very receptive to our needs and were easy to deal with. We did have a strange experience though, we asked the front desk to have our beds turned down and they said we were on the list for that service and when we got back to our room only the sleeper coach was touched. Very strange. Overall, we were very happy with our experience and I would recommend this place for a fairly nice inexpensive suite by NY standards."
50,1806,"Apr 22 2008 	Strongly recommend	Great location, great staff and okay rooms. Stayed here for just 2 nights before we went to Boston for St Patricks - hotel in Boston not a patch on this one and was more expensive!! Room not great but okay for NY - how long will you be in your room! Will be coming back to NYC in 2008 and will be staying at Fitzpatricks!"
51,1806,"Apr 16 2008 	not one of my best stays here	I ususally bring the family twice a year for the past 3 years to the Fitzpatrick Manhatan.Things have changed quite a bit from the last time I stayed. They are undergoing renovations in the hotel. It looks promising but some aspects of the hotel has changed.The ReviewThe service at the restarant was not as good as it use to be. The waitresses are pretty much new. The one waitress we had seemed annoyed with us or she could have been having a bad day..... The staff has changed a lot too....and not for the good. Besides the usual high standard of service from Carol at the bar who can keep a night interesting, Mike from the bellstand who is always up to talking and helping us with anything we need or want whenever we come, and Jamal who always makes sure that everything is going good with our stay Everyone else seemed to be giving the cold shoulder in general. The front desk needs to get their act together because II was told one thng by one person and the next day I was told the complete opposite by another person. The room was great. Of course the bed is the best feature in the room. TVs are a great upgrade too. I will be staying again at Manhatan but I really do hope the staff gets better."
52,1806,"Apr 3 2008 	Not great at all	While the location is fine , if you go expecting the same standard as the Fitzpatrick Hotel in Dublin , you will be very disappointed.We had a number of silly problems in our room like faulty heater , nosiy air con which prevented us sleeping.The lifts need a major overhaul as they are noisy in the extreme and can be heard from most rooms in the hotel. The bar area looks fine in the brouchure but it caters for a young crowd , playing loud music with people shouting to be heard . Not good as a spot to relax. Again its basic.Staff were a mixed bunch . Some very friendly others cold and awkward to deal .This was our first time in Big Apple , when we go back , I don't think we will be staying in the Grand Central unless there is some major renovations carried out."
53,1806,"Mar 10 2008 	great location	great location, staff were very friendly and always eager to help.we stayed in a junior suite (3 people). this incorparated one dbl bed, which i was told was the best sleep my friends have had. i got the fold out bed in the living area, not the comfiest but after being on the feet all day shopping, i slept great.the hotel is in a great location for shopping, restaurants etcsmall negitive was-There was some refurbishment going on in the bar and restaurant area so we ended up avoiding the bar, would have been nice to have somewhere to relax after some shooping ect."
54,1806,"Feb 25 2008	New York Boys Tour	New York in Feb is cold but the ambience of the Fizpatrick Manhattan warms you up. From the warm, unassuming welcome we knew we were on a winner. The foyer is pleasant and compact. The bar/resturant area is tastefully set out providing comfortable dining and drinking facilities. As two boys on shopping trip for the ladies we were treated to a change of room on day two to a huge twin room with double beds. The room and bathroom were first class. Staff were excellent and very welcoming. Bar staff exceptionally so too providing all the Soccer/football we wanted. Location of Hotel is first rate and proximity of tourist sites makes walking or subway travel easy.We will be back, with the women though."
55,1806,"Feb 18 2008 	Great Base for a Tourist	My wife and I stayed here 11-14/02/2008 for a combined birthday/Valentines day break. We had stayed in the sister hotel, Fitzpatrick's Grand Central,2 years ago but couldn't get booked in there this time. We arrived mid afternoon and the helpful front of house staff soon had us checked in and dispatched to our 12th floor room. Minor disappointment as the room was to the rear of the hotel rather than to the front as we had requested on our booking some months before. But the room was nice and warm with the air con already blowing warm air- welcome as it was about -5c outside. The hotel is a lot smaller than a lot of NYC hotels, one reason why we choose it. The room had all the basic requirements- coffee maker, foc safe and a lovely big soft bed, upholstered to give a 4 poster feel. Not the biggest room and slightly smaller than the one we had in the sister hotel but plenty big for us. En-suite bathroom/shower + built-in wardrobe gave us ample space. There was a flat screen TV, but with v poor reception but we never used it much anyway. After storing our stuff we had a quick drink in the hotel bar, `Fitzers`. Apparently it has been recently refurbished but we felt it was a bit dull and lifeless. The main reason we choose this hotel was its location. At the uptown end of Lexington Avenue, an awful lot of real estate was within easy walking distance- 10 minutes to Central Park, Rockefeller Centre; about 30 minutes to Broadway/Times Square etc. And it is very to walk around and not get lost- the whole area is laid out in a big grid, all well signposted. In all our time there we never had to use a taxi or the subway. We prebooked a Grays Uptown and Downtown Loop bus tour to get round the city,which has hop on/off stops at about 45 major tourist sites the length of Manhattan.We didn't eat in the hotel at all- no atmosphere, as stated and overpriced. For breakfast each morning we went round the corner onto East 56th Street to `Madelines` Diner and had very nice breakfast rolls (eggs- over easy + bacon/sausage) coffee and orange all for an excellent price and the staff were as friendly as you could get anywhere. Other places we ate were Outback - an Australian themed steakhouse on 3rd Avenue (about 10 minutes away). OK food at a reasonable price. Also `Bubbagumps` on Broadway/Times Square- some critics label this place a tourist trap but we have been here twice and loved it - Forest Gump themed restaurant specializing mostly on shrimp dishes with great 1st floor views over Times Square. Very friendly and good craic - and you most probably will be tourists so why not! Another nice place was `PJ Carneys` bar on East 56th Street, on the other side of Lexington Ave from Madeline`s. A wee Irish bar with mostly Irish staff. Lovely cold beers and they were doing an afternoon/evening special of a pint and a burger or wings for $9.95- about 5.10 when we were there. You could hardly get value like that at home and this was in the heart of NYC! Don't forget to tip, at those prices!!In summary, the hotel may not be the most exciting or the cheapest place to stay in NYC and but it is reliable and has a wonderful location for touring about."
56,1806,Feb 15 2008 	Holiday in New York	We stayed here for 4 night in April 2006 as part of our holiday. Fantastic hotel. Staff very friendly. The rooms were spacious enough. The location is great also.....
57,1806,Feb 13 2008	great family hotel	We decided to go with the Fitzpatrick Hotel after hearing good things from my cousin who stayed there last summer. I brought my family for the first time to NYC and the service was top notch ( Especially with the Euro!)We checked in for 5 nights from monday and checked out on Friday. We cehcked in at about 12 noon and the room was not ready so we stored our bags with the bellman Mike who was always there to help us throughout our stay and was great in giving us directions especially with the underground.The location is GREAT! So many stores near the hotel like Bloomingdales. Next to two underground lines which take you anywhere you need to go. I recommend learning to use the subway its much quicker to get around when there is traffic. If you want some good food you can go to Smith and Wollensky for steaks and Bice for Italian even though it is quite expensive but food was top notch.The room was big and was very confortable.At night I went to the bar and Carol at the bar was great.Only snag I would say was when we called down to the front desk to get help with the safe. We called down once and they said they would send someone up and nobody came so we called down again and the lady at the front desk seemed to get annoyed by us calling again ( We had some important documents that needed to be locked) but that was over and done with.Once again it was a great hotel to stay in and everyone is friendly and always willing to help.
58,1806,Feb 8 2008 	Brillant Hotel - great location	We had our Christmas party last year in New York and stayed in the Fitzpatrick on Lexington Ave.You can't get better for location - bloomingdales is 2 blocks up and 5th avenue is not even 5 mins walk away. (For the girls ** New Yorks best Nail bar is around the cornor too ;-) Had a suite room - which was small but perfectly formed. Fab power shower and soft robes which was the perfect cure to a hard days shopping. The staff are all long term and most seemed to be Irish. They were all very helpful and nothing seemed too much - even when we were checking out but not flying out till late that night. They held our bags and ordered us a mini-bus for no extra charge.The bar is new and quite modern (not sure if its in keeping with the rest of the hotel decor which is quite old-world) but I heard the rest of the hotel is getting re-done so maybe its all part of it.The food in the bar is really good and quite reasonable and as for NYC its better than ever!
59,1806,"Feb 4 2008 	Great Hotel Great Location and very friendly staff	Great Hotel.. Very friendly staff and were very accomodating to all visitors.. Room was lovely and clean.. Great location to central park, fifth avenue and all the shops.. Bar was good fun at night and the Bar Staff made us feel very welcome.. Overall we had a great stay at this hotel and will definately return again soon.."
60,1806,"Jan 21 2008 	Loved it!	I would defo return to this hotel. We stayed for 3 nights and really enjoyed it. It has the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in! The rooms was a good size, had a walk in small wardrobe, small bathroom, with a great shower, a small room just in the door with tea/coffee making facilities and a small fridge.The staff were very friendly and helpfulSmall menu but the food was nice and breakfast was good and not overpriced."
61,1806,"Jan 16 2008 	just love fitzpatricks	i stay here at least once a year on annual shopping trips. it always feels like a home from home. service is excellant, rooms lovely with the most comfortable beds in the world! very convenient for bloomingdales and 5th avenue shoppong. good irish breakfast every morning."
62,1806,"Jan 12 2008 	Mixed feelings about this place	Having read the reviews I must be the only Irish person not to love this place!!During out stay last August the restaurant was under renovations - could live with this, no reduction in price of food despite having to eat it in tiny bar.Rooms were absolutely tiny and very noisy, bed not comfortable at all.Service excellent although we arrived at 10pm and room still not ready for us.Stayed for 2 nights before moving onto W Times Square which was more our scene - really modern. Had 2 great nights in the Bar in the Fitzpatrick but it was just like being out at home and we wanted something more New York style!Overall felt the place was over rated for what we paid."
63,1806,"Jan 5 2008 	A Home Away From Home ""Wicklow Family""	Fitzpatrick is a real home away from home. My wife myself and 2 daughters stayed at this hotel for 8 nights in june 07.It was fantastic so much so we are going back in February. The rooms are excellent clean and have everything you need. The staff are so friendly and helpful the minute you walk in the door you feel welcome.The bar is warm and friendly a mix of visitors and locals that make you feel welcome to there bar( and i did spot a few famous faces in for a drink ).The location is perfect for all the sites of New York, Central park is just 5 min away and subway is about 2 min. The food in the hotel is excellent as well,the Cod Goujons are to die for, the breakfast is just like your mother used to make.We had a great time here,we have stayed in few hotels around the world and this is top of our list. The price was good and value for money i have read other review's about this hotel saying it was to pricey but you get what you pay in Fitzpatricks, After all our President stays here when she visiting NY. If it is good enough for her it is good enough for me. I would say to anyone going to visit NY stay here it Safe, Friendly,Well Loacted, Value for money.Many of friends have stayed here and say the same, As i said it is a HOME AWAY FROM HOME."
64,1806,"Jan 4 2008	fantastic beds shame about the traffic noise	Stayed from the 24th November for 5 nights booked a suite for 2 adults and 2 children very comfortable our bedroom had 2 double beds sooo comfortable.The staff were extremely helpful and the cleaning lady would never take the tip I left her, without me leaving a note.Each day when we came back to our room my daughters toy monkey used to be propped up in different poses on her pillow I thought what a lovely touch.Rooms spotless my only problem was the draughty windows if only they would double glaze the windows it would more than half the traffic noise and keep away the draughts from under the curtains.We loved New York and will return, maybe to a different hotel.I thought it was a bit too expensive 3,400 dollars with no breakfast!Though we really enjoyed our stay.For a change I would try some place different but I most certainly will be back sometime in the future........................."
65,1806,"Dec 16 2007 	Towel S	As worldwide hotels go, this is a just above mediocre establishment. However, as US hotels go, I would say it is quite a good hotel.Friendly, though not overly efficient staff, reasonable sized bedrooms, nice bar and good food."
66,1806,"Nov 22 2007 	great hotel fabulous location	Having read the reviews on this site I was a little concerned about what was waiting for us, I had booked the holiday for me and my partner and another couple. The minute we arrived and were greeted at reception I knew it was going to be ok. The rooms are lovely, old fashioned and comfortable. Very relaxing and quiet for its location. Had breakfast on our last morning in Fitzers bar, no complaints full Irish can't go wrong really!! The bar is currenlty undergoing renovations and looks dark and small at the moment. Its not fully opened yet, renovations are due to finish shortly. Should be nice once its finished. Overall the location is fantastic 57th and Lex, walking distance from everywhere. Would recommend, worth the price."
67,1806,"Nov 19 2007 	Once again a great stay at the Fitzpatrick	I brought the family for a vacation in October. Ive been here on my own before for business and it was the first time I bring everyone with me to NY. I was greeted straightaway by the bell captain Mike who throughout our stay was there to guide us with whatever we needed.The elevator was a tad slow and we took the stairs down a few stories which was no problem at all ( Even though the stairs could be more cleaner, we had to jump over a few garbage bags.). The bar is pricey but its not everyday you are in new york. We ate only once in the restaurant, and while the food is good its not worth all the extra add ons to the bill gratuity tax etc. We went to a different restaurant daily, and Smith and Wolensky is great for steaks but go hungry! The house ladies cleaned the rooms great, even though they forgot to give us a turndown service for one of the nights, and I called down to the lobby. I told them to not bother because its late but just wanted to let them know that it was not done. But, overall the staff was the best. David helped us out with good advice in what to do in the city, as well as Mike who is a great asset to the hotel and was really kind with the children. There was times that our stay could have been mediocre, but the good outweighs the bad greatly, and its worth the price we put for the suite for 5 nights. CAnt wait to bring the family back next year."
68,1806,"Oct 31 2007 	ScaryNasty and Never Again	All I can say is don't waste your time staying here. The Management is poor quality especially when they are yelling at the staff in front of hotel guests. The elevator is always breaking down and they expect you to climb up and down the stairs to your room and that is an experience in itsfelf. The stairs are cluttered with Bags and Bags of trash, dirty linen and trays. Even the halls were cluttered with bags of dirty &amp; clean linen and it makes me wonder if my bed was changed with what? The staff is in such fear of making a decision and every request was given the answer of &quot;LET ME ASK MY MANAGER&quot; and you have to wait and wait.The rooms are different. Some remodled and some that look like Motel 6.My only good thing to say was Housekeeping staff was pleasant and the housekeeping Manager he was great and he took care of our needs without question and as busy as he was I am suprised. The maid was great and we never had to ask for a thing so it makes me wonder why everyone else was so scary.My plans to stay elsewhere is a no brainer."
69,1806,"Oct 30 2007 	Average to say the least ....	To be honest I had heard that this was a nice hotel, but when we got there I have to say that it was very average!!The rooms were smallish and I don't like the set up with the bar.For the price I think we could of found better.Still, it does have a good location."
70,1806,"Oct 12 2007 	Great location hotel ok	We booked this through Lastminute.com a couple of weeks ago as a birthday treat for us both as it sold itself as a 4* boutique hotel..also, I knew that it is in a fantastic location close to Bloomingdales and a short walk to subway stations, 5th &amp; Madison Avenues and Central Park. When we checked in, the lobby &amp; restaurant were undergoing refurbishment, which we weren't warned about, however there was a big notice to say that for the inconvenience, a complimentary continental breakfast would be available in the bar. The next morning, we tried it to find that there was a pile of pre-wrapped croissants (no butter or preserves), and a bowl of fruit, as well as only one juice, and tea &amp; coffee- hardly a complete breakfast, and it appeared that the hotel was paying lip-service to it. If you are going to inconvenience customers, make a proper effort! The room, although not particularly big, was clean, decorated nicely with a fantastically comfortable bed. However, be careful as the games, CD library &amp; films on the TV can cost $9 per hour! The bathroom was immaculate, with free toiletries but only one robe (odd as there were two of us), and the staff, especially Dave the barman, and Mike the porter were really friendly &amp; helpful.All in all, not a bad hotel- excellent location &amp; clean. However having stayed in other hotels in the States, I was disappointed in its fundamental qualities, and in my opinion should be rated as 3*. 4* hotels generally have a decent breakfast, service lifts for the staff to use instead of them using the guest ones, and a bar which isn't an Irish themed pub. If the little tweaks were perfected, it would be excellent, at the moment, it's just OK. But I may think about staying here again....."
71,1806,"Oct 6 2007 	Dont waste you money on this hotel	For a start this hotel is completly overprice from the room down to the bar. The rooms are dark with little light and only a view of a brick wall from you window, the food wasnt great, the evalvator was out of order, It has virtually no facilities you could almost fit the bar in your pocket and it is the only facilityin the place. I would strongly recommend you to spend your money on a more worthy hotel in new york city."
72,1806,"Oct 2 2007 	Best hotel ever	We loved Fitzpatrick Manhattan. The staff were wonderful especially the bartender Carol... she is great, every bar should have a member of staff like her.We will definately go back!!"
73,1806,"Oct 1 2007 	Great Deal	Two friends and I just stayed three nights at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan for a girls' weekend. We had a very nice two-room suite with a living room and bedroom. The living room had a pull out sofa bed that was comfortable but still a pull out sofa bed. The bedroom had a extra plush, super comfy queen size bed that was very luxurious. We all took turns sleeping one night on the sofa bed. We also each had a nice fluffy bathrobe and every night when we came back from shopping our beds were made up and there were three nice bottles of spring water and chocolates waiting for us. Overall we were all impressed with the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the location is great. My only complaint is that the hotel does smell of cigarette smoke, so if you're sensitive to that you might not like it."
74,1806,"Sep 30 2007 	behind closed doors....	.....a secret awaits you in this very comfortable and friendly hotel. Ok so you don't get a room with a view but who needs one, your in New York for goodness sake. Nor is this hotel modren, its comfortable ( bit like staying in your grannies and I mean that in the nicest way ).Our room was great, softest bed we've ever slept in,room was a great size (big enough to store our shopping,well a girls got to shop eh! ) with tastfull furniture ,indulging smellies in the bathroom and the staff were very friendly and helpfull. After walking your legs off in NY, it's really lovely to walk into Fitzpatricks hotel knowing that you have a great room to relax in or have a quiet drink in the bar without hassle. The breakfast is very pricey but hearty in the hotel so maybe opt to eat out.............we ate here on a Sunday morning only because the city's local diners were closed. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in NY. Can't wait to return."
75,1806,"Aug 22 2007	just OK	I wasn't thrilled with the Fitzpatrick, but it was a decent hotel.Some of the good things about it:~very comfy beds~rooms and bathrooms were classy~wonderful shower!Some of the bad things about it:~the rooms and bathrooms were incredibly cramped~they are undergoing renovation and the elevator is slow and always crowded~there is no bathroom in the lobby; instead they give you a key to a vacant hotel room on the 2nd floor~front desk service varies; there seems to be a problem with task management/organization.~no gym or pool~I expected a better complimentary breakfast - here it was assortment of fruits + packaged pastries - from a hotel of this caliber. In spite of these problems, it is a good location, and the rooms are quality. Everything was very clean."
76,1806,"Jul 30 2007 	Great comfy base to explore NYC	This is a brilliant hotel, attentive staff, handy bar for a nightcap and great bar food. Although currently undergoing renovations this didn't spoil our stay, we got a great sized room and bathroom. It's a great hotel to explore NY from, walking distance of Bloomingdales or the subway to explore uptown or downtown. Great restauants nearby, Smith and Wollensky do a great steak!"
77,1806,"Jul 11 2007 	Fantastic location great hotel	My fiancee and I stayed in this hotel for a four night break and we could not recommend it enough. It is a great place to stay for comfort, location and overall experience. The room, a deluxe queen, was larger than i expected, and included a walk in wardrobe, which contained a safe, an ironing board and iron, hangers and extra pillows. The bathroom was a decent enough size and was very clean, however, the bath was the oddest shape and very low to the ground, useful only for the shower! The staff were very friendly and the hotel had a pleasant atmosphere, and was surprisingly quiet. The area itself was also very relaxed and a great starting point to explore the city. There is a subway station two blocks north of the hotel at bloomingdales (which was perhaps too close, given that my fiancee loved the shops). The subway was a lot safer than you would be led to believe and an inexpensive way to travel around after your ticket for the sightseeing bus runs out! Also nearby is central park and a few blocks away from tiffany (too close again!). If you wish to gain a perspective on how well the city has bounced back since 9/11, visit the memorial centre at Ground Zero, it is impossible to see this and not be moved. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel and this city to anyone, couple, family or otherwise, you will not be disappointed. P.S. The beds are more comfortable than in any hotel i've ever stayed in."
78,1806,"Jun 19 2007 	A very welcoming hotel in a great location!	Stayed with family (5) for 7 nights at end of May in a linked suite. It was a great haven after each long day's activity around Manhattan. Particularly after visiting Times Square (daytime and nightime) we realised that we were staying in an ideal part of town for relaxation (if you wanted it!) in a family friendly environment. Staff throughout made you feel you were their personal guest, from concierge, reception, bar &amp; restaurant.We dined in the restaurant a couple of times &amp; it was very good all round with the added benefit of enjoying 'a night at home' for a change along with a good pint at Fitzers bar.I would be happy to recommend wholeheartedly."
79,1806,May 29 2007	Great Place	Just back from a great trip to New York Four nights in The Fitzpatrick's Manhattan we found this a excellent place to stay. Close to Fifth Avenue and a short walk from Times Square. Very friendly hotel staff who would go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. I was expecting very small rooms for New York but our room was very spacious with everything you could need for a few days - even an umbrella in your closet for the wet days in New York. All the hotel staff were pleasent from the morning staff for breakfast to the bar staff last thing at night. Overall i would recomend this hotel to anyone who was visiting New York.
80,1806,"May 25 2007	Great hotel - but pricey!!	Stayed here for 3 nights before travelling upstate to a wedding in April. We got a room with a suite and there was loads of space! The heating didn't work - so it was a bit chilly (apparently the heating doesn't work between April and October), NY was freezing!The room was clean and well maintained. The staff were very helpful and overall it was a great stay - just very pricey, but I suppose that is to be expected from a mid-town hotel. Stayed in Fitzpatrick's Grand Central on our return from upstate and we felt it was a much better location and great food in the bar, however the staff there were not as pleasant!"
81,1806,"Mar 21 2007 	An excellent choice at a reasonable price	I have stayed at both Fitzpatricks in New York and they both live up to their billing of being cozy, reasonably priced (for New York), elegant hotels. As with the Fitzpatrick Grand Central, the rooms are very small and best suited for a single traveler or a couple that likes to be close. That said the rooms are nicely decorated, have excellent amenities, flat screen TVs, a double headed shower, bathrobe, etc., - everything you would expect from a high end hotel. I found the size of the bathroom quite adequate. The staff was polite and helpful. I left an overnight kit behind and they had it back to me in two days with no fuss. It seems like a small thing, but rarely does retrieving ones personal items from a hotel go so smoothly."
82,1806,"Mar 5 2007	Wonderful hote	In short, this hotel is in a great midtown location, and like the other reviewers, although I hardly used anything but the room as a base, when I did deal with the staff, they were very helpful and courteous. I originally booked for 3 nights, but asked to extend for another 3, which was quickly accomodated. The room was attended to every day, even though I was one of those annoying staff who was always still in bed at regular servicing hours. I had a few drinks in the bar downstairs, which was lively and warm.The location is great. A walk to Times Square, Central Park, and a zillion subway stations. I don't know how people can complain about noise, you're in the middle of the busiest city in the world!!! I slept with the windows open most nights, and noise didn't bother me at all. I was on the 15th floor.When I checked out, my bags were stored for a few hours no trouble at all while I did my last walk around the city and completed a few tasks. Cab was called, and the concierge found the address of my airport hotel quick smart. The room was spotless, shower and bathroom perfect size. Two double beds, great flat screen tv, even internet access via the tv (although some websites didn't work, and navigation was non-trivial!). And just so close to a million eateries.Sometimes I think some of the bad reviews on this website are people who are NEVER satisfied. The Fitzpatrick Manhattan was a great experience for me. I paid $280 total per night, which I was satisfied with."
83,1806,"Mar 5 2007	Best in town....	Stayed ther for 2 nights as part of a longer trip to NY. Paid 250 euro per night booking 1 week beforehand for a suite.Must say the place was fantastic, great sized room for New York City, loved the decor and the overall aura of the hotel. The main room had a 42 inch plasma and the bedroom had a 28 inch screen, perfect for when the old jet lag kicks in and you find yourself awake at 4.30 am for the first 2 mornings. Movie selection was very recent and reasonably priced at 10 dollars. Some films are not even in uk cinemas as yet. The Fitzers bar downstairs was also top class, food selection good for a light snack and the hospitality was oozing from the staff.Location is very central and A GOOD WALK CAN REACH MOST ATTRACTIONS ON MANHATTAN ISLAND. Can highly recommend the 2 hour boat tour of Manhattan and the statue of liberty etc, leaves pier 42 every 2-3 hours. Only 20 something dollars a head.All in all I will return here someday soon, only slight niggles were the price of a pint in the bar at 7 dollars plus then a tip!!!! And our tv was broken in the main room and when requested to be fixed it wasnt.... although the second one at the end of the bed meant that we were not stuck...Try a local eaterie called Europcafe on Lexington for gorgeous snacks its about a 5 min walk east from the hotel.....Highly recommend a stay here and if your Irish all the better as the hotel is full of us thick paddys....."
84,1806,"Mar 1 2007	Deluxe suites not suitable for 3	I stayed in this hotel last weekend 23rd february as part of a group of 40. We were booked into the deluxe suites as we had to treble up. I was the unfortunate 3rd person that slept in the sitting area that had a pull dodwn couch b ed. I did not have a problem with this but was provided with o ne blanket only. The window was ajar all noght and could not be closed. I never slept one bit I was so cold. When I complained the following morning, blankets were provided for the following night and a caretaker was sent up to close the window. Only for this problem, there was a nice firendly atmosphere and breakfast was good."
85,1806,"Dec 11 2006 	A rare treat ...a warm friendly new york hotel!	stayed here for 3 nights at the start of december,my first time at the fitzpatricks.i booked a suite for extra space as i have been told the nonsuite{delux rooms} are very small.we arrived at night after a nightmare taxi ride from newark airport[unbelievably rude taxi driver who didnt know his way] ,and settled into the hotel.myself and my wife had a suite and friends booked a delux room.the staff at check in were irish and very welcoming. the suite was very pleasant but with 2 drawbacks,no aircoditioning and the smallest hotel bathroom i have ever seen.it was explained to me that the air conditioning only works in the summer months,while in the winter it is used to heat the room only.opening the windows helped cool the room and they provided us with a fan.the bed was extremly comfortable and the room came wiht 2 plasma televisions.the hotel has an excellent and friendly staff...indeed a very rare find in new york.a small but very cosey bar is just off the lobby which i regret we didnt use more.our friends loved the hotel..yes they said their room was small ,but the comfy bed made up for it.while this hotel is not flash ,i do recommend it,mainly due to the very friendly irish staff,good location and that bed!.pity about the tiny bathroom but it is only a small crib in an otherwise excellent hotel"
86,1806,"Sep 22 2006 	Fantastic Stay	We booked a room at the hotel for our last nights stay in the US. It was such a nice way to finish a holiday. It's a wonderful hotel. The staff are all very friendly and very welcoming. Our suite was beautiful with a sitting room, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. With a queen size bed, it was an extremely pleasant stay. Would highly recommend to anyone!"
87,1806,"Sep 1 2006 	Clean and friendly but nothing exceptional	A reasonable location close to Park and 5th Avenue. We had a suite with our 2 young kids which was fine, clean and well cleaned etc. No view on the 6th floor, you need to get a higher room.The staff were friendly especially at breakfast where they made the kids feel special. Otherwise it is a good place to stay at a reasonable price without being mind blowing in anyway but we have no complaints either."
88,1806,"Aug 22 2006	Misleading	Onthe hotel's .com website, the Fitz Patrick in Manhattan was rated well and I thought I was getting a good place for a little getaway. The room that I booked was the deluxe room and was non smoking. Also, Hotels.com said the hotel had been updated in 2005.The staff was friendly but from the minute we stepped in the room I knew something was wrong. EVen though it was clearly marked non-smoking room, we could smell cigarette smoke everywhere. There were cigeratte holes in the curtains and the entire table/desk was covered in dust.The bathroom wasn't even big enought to turn around in. The mirrow was losing all of it's finish ( a clear sign that the place had not been remodeled last year) The bottom the vanity was also kciked in.Next time I will go back to a place we know and be a little bit less trusting of Hotels.com information."
89,1806,"Aug 18 2006	Great for families	So, there is good and bad about the Fitzpatrick ManhattanOn the good side: You can get a two room suite with kitchenette for the price of most hotel rooms in NY. We have stayed there twice with a young child. If you stay for a good number of nights in a row, you get a good discount. So, for a week this past July, it cost around $250 a night for a REAL two room suite- (not a fake suite that just has an alcove) It was really like a decent sized apartment. That is unbeatable in New York. This is a great option for a family where you want to put the kids to bed before you have to go to bed.The staff is very nice. Many employees from Ireland. It is a nice small hotel feel. The location is great. Right in midtown- a bit more of an upscale area. And, away from the lunacy of Times Square. If you are brining kids to NY- this is a great option- don't stay in Times Square!and the bad:Two visits in a row we got to the hotel late at night and they gave us a key. We opened the door only to find the room not ready for us. First time we opened the door to find someone else's clothes still in the closet. I closed the door quickly- they may have been in there. On the second visit, we opened the door to find dirty wine glasses and garbage on the table, and a used shower with wet towels on the floor.The housekeeping and front desk staff REALLY need to get their act together to know if people have indeed really checked out.Both of these were shocking and unforgivable for any hotel.On both ocassions we had this problem only on checkin. The housekeeping was fine for the rest of the time.So, overall, I recommend this hotel, but the problem above should be noted."
90,1806,"Jun 29 2006	Service beats style	My girlfriend and I called the Fitzpatrick Manhattan home for six nights in late April. The one thing that stands out about this place is the exceptional service.We arrived early in the morning on Easter Sunday after a long flight from London. Our bleary eyes were fully prepared to walk around like zombies until check-in, but the lovely lady at the front desk gave us our room straight away! This was a godsend and much appreciated.Although our room was compact and facing an inside wall of the hotel, we didn't mind because it was as quiet as a mouse (something rare in NYC).Though the room was small the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had all you needed. There is a subway station about a block and a half up Lexington, which can then take you to anywhere you want to go. There is also a convenient pub adjoining the hotel which again had a very friendly barman. Geez the Irish are nice! We didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant because it was a bit expensive, but there was plenty to eat in the surrounding blocks.Overall we were very impressed with the friendliness of the staff and the standard of our room. Would definitely stay there again."
91,1806,"May 20 2006	Unbeatable	We stayed here on our honeymoon and could honestly say that the staff in this hotel are without doubt the best. As soon as we arrived, we were upgraded to a suite. The room was not ready but we were sent into the bar for a complimentary drink. Upon arriving to our room, there was a bottle of champagne on ice, butlers chocolates and a note wishing us all the best on our honeymoon. The staff here are so friendly and courteous and its obvious to see that they are trying their best to make you feel welcome and at home. After a busy day shopping in New York, there is nothing as nice as returning to the cosy atmosphere of this hotel. The rooms are quite small but are clean &amp; comfortable and to be honest you spend such a short amount of time in your room that the size really does not make that much difference. This hotel has a great location, walking distance to just about everything. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in New York. It may not be the biggest or the plushest hotel but in my opinion the atmosphere and the staff make it the best hotel around!!"
92,1806,"May 4 2006	Warm welcome large rooms great value	We booked this hotel through Expedia on basis of price and location. Was quite cheap for the period at around $225/night inc tax, so I was a bit nervous about the quality we would experience. However, right from check-in the experience was great.Check in staff were extremely welcoming and friendly. When they gave us a room on 3rd floor by the elevator, I feared it would be a substandard room, as so often happens when you book through internet agencies. True, the room did overlook the light-well, but was reasonably bright and most importantly had no noise from street, kitchens or elevator. In fact, the best surprise was that the room was HUGE by NYC standards, with a small kitchen area, lobby and walk in closet, as well as the queen sized bed and full bathroom (great toiletries by the way as well). Only criticism of the room would be the traditional floral decor which might not be everyone's taste (including mine).We found the bar to be a bit dingy, but with very friendly Irish staff, as well as live rugby. The concierge (also Irish) gave us a great recommendation for going out of the hotel for a drink as well, and when it poured with rain, the bell-boy was happy to lend us his umbrella.Finally, location was perfect for shopping (especially Bloomingdales) and had lots of reasonably priced eateries for breakfast and lunch nearby. I would definitely return next time I am in New York - by far the friendliest hotel I have stayed at there and feels more like a small guest-house."
93,1806,"Apr 30 2006	Cosy central comfortable and charming - and not too pricey!	I spent a week here with my hubby and another couple and we were all very impressed with the hotel. The rooms are cosy, spacious, the beds are lovely and comfortable, there was a bathtub (a big plus for me), coffeemaking facilities and everything is very clean. My only two minor complaints would be the fixed showerhead (a bugbear of mine) and the 10 dollars internet charge - I only wanted 10 mins now and then to check my mails. The staff are friendly and very helpful. The Irish bar is cosy but perhaps some bartenders weren't as charming as others! A nice touch was when we'd arrived after a very long flight and as the rooms weren't quite ready we were offered complimentary drinks at the bar. The hotel has few facilities, just the small bar and restaurant, which won't suit everyone but was fine for us, we weren't spending much time at the hotel, how could we with such a fabulous city waiting for us outside! The hotel is in a great central location, but we didn't find it noisy at all. Would definitely use it again."
94,1806,"Apr 19 2006 	Great Stay	Enjoyed this hotel very much. The room was ideal -- perfect for my wife and I and our 14-year-old daughter. My travel agent forgot to let the hotel know we were bringing our daughter along on the trip, but the hotel staff accomodated us without any trouble. She had the sofa (hideaway bed) and we had the bedroom. The bar was a great place to grab a nice ale or scotch before dinner. Good location and close to subway stops, Central Park, and shopping."
95,1806,"Apr 19 2006	Adored this hotel	We stayed in Fitzpatrick's while on our honeymoon - although it was completely unplanned. We had initially checked in to the really diappointing Doubletree Hilton further down Lexington for a few nights prior to heading to the Caribbean and couldn't wait to get away from the place. Anyway we popped in to Fitzpatrick's on the off chance that they would have a room and got one for 140! Great room, small but perfectly adequate, really lovely. Service was second to none, food was great (nachos in the bar were super), staff were really excellent and made us feel very welcome. We stayed again on the way back from Jamaica and I have to say it really made our honeymoon for us. Great place for breakfast across the street, down a side street, its called the Palace - try it!"
96,1806,"Apr 11 2006	A good experience	We spent a week in a suite with our two year old daughter. To sum up:Positives:Location (the most important thing for any hotel).Room size, admittedly it was a suite but it was excellent value.Service  the hotel staff were very courteous, friendly &amp; knowledgeable. We didnt try the restaurant or bar.Beds  huge &amp; comfortableRoom amenities  a fridge, a counter &amp; sink, two televisions, a great sofa.Negatives:Relatively noisy, but then it is Manhattan. We got used to it &amp; all slept very well.Lack of facilities, but again it is Manhattan so you have no excuse to be bored.We were there in April, so I dont know how effective the heating or air-conditioning are.Wed be back."
97,1806,"Apr 6 2006	Stay far away....	My fiance and I stayed at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel for a long weekend. Front desk was friendly, never went out of their way to make you feel special, but friendly enough. Room was a little small, but good enough for what we needed as we planned on shopping our entire trip anyway. Had a terrible experience our last night at the bar. We were the only Americans there and were treated as if we didn't belong. Rude bartender with an Irish accent, was extremely short and couldn't wait to be finished with us to go back to chatting with her irish 'friends'. Didn't even bother finishing our drinks (which were expensive). If you aren't Irish, stay out of this bar, you will not feel welcomed!!!!"
98,1806,"Mar 31 2006	Ahhh...the bed!	Room was small but perfectly formed and had everthing we needed. Cosy and warm. The bed was lovely, really comfortable and there was great storage. Would have liked a stronger power shower though.We loved the art deco decor and elevators.Service was excellent, from reception to concierage and bar. Food was real comfort fare from home, but always tasty. Would have been nice to have a separate restaurant though and I loved the huge ladies bathroom in the bar! No Murphys in bar let it down!Brilliant location, loved it. Everything is nearby but was not noisy at night. Would definitely stay again."
99,1806,Mar 25 2006 	Ritz who?	Who needs the Ritz when you got the Fitzpatrick Manhattan!
100,1806,"Mar 5 2006	Stay somewhere else	No Facilities. There is no restaurant, only one bar downstairs which was closed for a private function one night during our stay. We were very disappointed as this hotel is very hyped in Ireland. Location is good though."
101,1806,"Feb 16 2006	the most comfortable beds	Our flight out of Kennedy was cancelledon Monday after the blizzard, so we decided to stay in the city. We had stayed at The fitzpatrick once before in a suite, but none were available this time. We booked over the phone and got a great rate of $199.00 for a regular room. The bed is the best part of all with pillow top mattresses and very soft pillows. The staff if friendly and will go out of their way to handle requests. The rooms are small but comfortable. The restaurant serves high quality comfort food. I would recommend this hotel highly."
102,1806,"Feb 14 2006 	They Came to My Rescue!	I was stranded in New York during the record-breaking blizzard on February 12, needed a place to stay, and called the Fitzpatrick on a friend's reccommendation.The experience couldn't have been nicer. The staff was unbelievably caring, and the elegant room was a cozy and warm oasis on a frigid winter night. Bedtime turn-down service included a soft, fluffy robe, slippers. mineral water, and some delicious Irish chocolate.I also enjoyed the hotel's authentic Irish pub-style restaurant. A fireplace warmed up the room, and the hearty stew that I chose for dinner was perfect on such a cold winter night. The bar was a great place to enjoy a cocktail and meet other people who were also &quot;stranded&quot;....none of us were complaining, though."
103,1806,"Jan 31 2006	Excellent location and hotel	We stayed in the fitzpatrick manhattan from the 25th to the 29th of January. We got an excellent rate of $199 a night and on arrival we were met by the manager who welcomed us and were checked in very quickly. Our bags were taken up to our room for us and our room was huge! We had a separate kitchen area which we used to store our luggage, a lovely bedroom with a nice big bed and a big bathroom, with a bath/shower. We also got some complimentary drinks vouchers for the bar when we checked in. The staff were very friendly, and the bar was lovely. We didnt eat in the restaurant but it was full most nights and seemed to do well. The location was perfect, 2 blocks away from the metro and bloomingdales, and 3 blocks cross-town to 5th avenue. We walked everywhere as it was such a good location. I would recommend the hotel to anyone"
104,1806,Dec 17 2005 	Very Very Nice Hotel make you feel at home!	I arrived at 10pm for an 8am interview. Having flown in from the west coast it was nice to be welcomed and checked-in so quickly. The bed was so comfortable I worried I wouldn't wake up on time! As another user pointed out the air conditioning was a little noisy - but I've barely been to a hotel that didn't have a similar problem. Everything was clean and welcoming - little mint chocolates on the pillow. If you go in winter you'll really enjoy the terry robes. I had a couple beer at the adjacent pub and met lots of nice people. In the morning I was treated to a nice quiet continental breakfast. Upon returning to the hotel after interview to check out - I was quickly given directions and the bell locked up my things so I could go lunch with a friend in Central Park. When I returned the bell quickly hailed me a cab - the first cabbie was rude and obnoxious so the bell politely sent him off and hailed another. No wonder this is one of the hotels of choice for my company - afterall I did get the job!
105,1806,"Dec 7 2005	Lovely Hotel and Staff	Myself and two friends stayed in the fitzpatricks Manhattan hotel from 30th Nov to 6th December. We booked a suite which had a seperate bedroom and a living room with a pull out sofabed. There was also a small kitchen with a fridge, sink and coffee maker. The rooms were both a good size and spotlessly clean. The hotel is small considering the size of some of the hotels in new york but we liked the fact that it was so intimate. All the staff were eager to help and made a point of asking how your day was. The bar and restaurant are small but we also liked that too. The great thing about Fitzpatricks is the fact that you can start shopping on your doorstep. Just two blocks away is Bloomingdales, Gap, Ninewest, H&amp;M, Levis and many others. Its also great for getting to the ferry for the statue of liberty. There is a subway stop right across the street from bloomingdales. Overall we loved this hotel and we plan on booking our second stay here in january."
106,1806,"Nov 7 2005	Makes one feel like royalty!	A lovely, quaint boutique-type of hotel that offers all of the comforts of home! The rooms are impeccably clean and the pillows and bed invite you to a restful sleep!Most important, the staff will go the extra mile to make sure you are satisifed with your stay. They make every effort to be friendly, accomodating and personable. Anything I have ever requested of the staff, they've delivered with a smile! They make an effort to refer to you by name and have the knack of making you feel like you're a special guest! I've stayed here three times over the past three years, and I've never been disappointed. I'm planning a fourth stay in a couple of months when I return to NYC. The warmth of Irish hospitality is evident in this fine establishment!"
107,1806,"Aug 20 2005	Great Place	We stayed in the Fitzpatrick Manhattan from on 14th Feb 05 for 6 nights and loved the hotel.We got a great deal on the room rate booking directly through their website....If thinking of headin over to NYC between Jan and the end of Feb the offers on their website are great and wont be beaten so try there first! It was my first time in NYC and so many people had told me not to expect much in the way of bedroom size, (especially when they heard the rate we were getting!), as it was standard enough that bedrooms in Manhattan were on the small side but to our suprise we had a very spacious room with a small kitchenette, which doubled as our dumping ground for our shopping and luggage. We did find the room to be a little cold. Being there in Feb it is understandably cold outside so you would expect the heating to be on full blast but the room was on the cool side......this didn't upset us too much as we were only there to change and sleep.The staff were great in the hotel very friendly and couldn't have been more helpful. As one of the other reviewers pointed out the bar is very small but serves its purpose all the same and its a great place to chat with fellow guests and get tips for different things to see and do. Most evenings we headed out to some well known bars in the area to get a real taste of nightlife in NY. We only ate once in the restaurant and weren't overly impressed with the food but it was tasty enough.The location is great and we walked everywhere. It is a 2 minute walk to Bloomingdales and 5/10mins to 5th Avenue and the entrance to Central Park. Overall I would definitely recommend a stay here particularly if you are going in Jan/Feb as it was fantastic value for money and it is a cosy homely hotel. One other thing for the shoppers among you....if thinking of going over in Feb try and be there for around the 22nd Feb (Presidents Day). The Monday around this date is a National Holiday in the US and the sales running up to the Monday are great especially in Woodbury Common Shopping Outlet the discount in most places was 50/75% off and made the long trip out to the outlet well worth it!!!!"
108,1806,"Jul 23 2005 	Not Good	Not sure what everyone else seems to love. My room was damp, the AC was incredibly noisy, part of the ceiling collapsed in the bathroom, the walls were paper thin (could hear the traffic/dump trucks cleaning dumpsters all night) and there was a strange moldy odor throughout my floor (the 5th). If you are looking for a great Boutique hotel in NYC, try the Hudson."
109,1806,"Apr 26 2005	Loved Feeling Like Family	We stayed at the Fitzpatrick over the weekend of 3/10/05. We had never stayed at a boutique-style hotel before, but it came recommended to us from someone who lives nearby. Traveling to NYC as a family of five can be challenging and certainly expensive. This hotel offers suites, and they are much more affordable than even a single room the major hotels. From my first phone call (to see if they would be completely irritated if we showed up with my three young boys), they were pleasant, informative, welcoming, and accomodating. When we arrived they greeted us by name and made us feel as if they were ready and waiting for us. The suite was beautifully appointed with tasteful and current styling. The linens were all higher-end Irish lines, and the lamps all evoked the Waterford crystal feel. For the boys, there was Nintendo in the room, as well as small but extremely useful kitchenette. The accomodations for us were perfect, in that my husband and I shared the king-sized bed in the bedroom and my children all slept on the oversized pull-out sofa in the living room. All weekend the staff greeted my boys by name, provided information as quickly as we could ask it, and greeted us regularly with a smile and our names. The restaurant in the hotel was wonderful, and the service was equally perfect. The Irish Breakfast is a requirement, as it provides authentic Irish Sausage, fabulous eggs and fluffy, completely filling pancakes. My in-laws recently returned from Ireland and said it tasted exactly as they remembered over there. The Bar has the neighborhood Irish Pub feel, with Guinness on tap and plenty of Irish locals filling the seats. They were most accomodating, pouring two Guinesses and helping me get them to my room when we returned early in the evening.Maybe it helped that we were there right before St. Patrick's Day, but this experience was perfect. I will stay there every time I return to New York, because it was wonderful to step away from the standard New York attitude into the welcoming home of the Irish."
110,1806,"Mar 28 2005	Emmm.... ok	We stayed in The Fitzpatricks in Jan 05. I have to admit we expected more after all the hype we read. It is a lovely friendly hotel and the staff are extremely attentive, but the hotel itself is small enough. The food is quite nice in the restaurant, (breakfast very expensive though, go to any of the delis nearby) but the bar is too small. The rooms were nice enough, but as a previous reviewer has said, we could have stayed in the Waldorf for the same price and regretfully we didn't. The Waldorf would have been much more central as well. The hightlight of our stay was we shared the lift one morning from the 9th floor with Phil Coulter! Overall I would stay again if the Waldorf or Sheraton Manhattan was not available."

121,1806,Aug 6 2009 	Trs bel hotel au juste emplacement !
1,1810,"OK but Not Great	Stayed for three nights. Got a really good deal through Hotwire so can't really complain. Tiny room with no housekeeping. Wireless never worked despite several requests to front desk. Local friends tried to telelphone three times and were told we weren't registered which messed up plans to meet. Bathroom was great, beds were comfy and location can't be beat. All in all a good deal but would try for something smaller and with a friendlier staff next time."
2,1810,"Nov 18 2009 	not bad	the hotel is very new, clean, and nice. it's directly across the street from port authority, in btwn 8th and 9th ave. right now there is alot of construction going on outside the hotel. but once you get inside, you don't hear any of the outside noise anf forget that the neighborhood you are in is a little bit suspect. there is a xxx dvd store on the block, but the area is not known to be really dangerous, although i was not about to leave the hotel at 2am to find out. one of my issues was that the rooms are a bit cramped, but it is ny. and at the sink, you can't have hot water w/o having the water pressure at the highest. i wasn't sure how to wash my face w/o splashing water all over my clothes so i let the water fill the sink and then washed my face."
3,1810,"Nov 13 2009 	Clean and New in Red Light District	I stayed here twice during October--once for Columbus Day weekend with my wife and a second time by myself for the World Series. I used Starwood points each time and, when I requested an upgrade based upon my platinum status, I was given a suite on the top floor (on my second visit). The rooms are quite nice and everything is brand new. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only downside of the hotel, as others have noted, is its location amidst porn shops across from Port Authority. If you can tolerate the half-block walk back to a mainstream neighborhood, the hotel is a good choice."
4,1810,"Nov 11 2009 	It's all relative in NYC.....	About me. Starwood Gold member and used points for two nights at this hotel. Rate I found on line was $315 per night which I felt was high for a Four Points property.Arrived just after 6 a.m. after a redeye from the west coast. Room availability at that hour is always a coin toss but they typically willl check you in when you are part of their &quot;program.&quot; In this case hotel was completely sold out the night before. Seeing I was in a jam, the front desk clerk offered me a key to a room that had been vacated but not yet cleaned so I could change into a suit for me meeting. The clerk that came on shortly after, asked for my cell # and called me by 9:20 a.m. with a clean room ready for my use. I've been to 5 star hotels that do not offer that kind of service. Bellman and conierge were also helpful, friendly and cordial each time I encountered them. I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel.Location - I had 25th floor at the back of the hotel facing the Westin at 51st and 8th. Noise was absolutely zero. I'm a little confused about the noise complaints from buses in and out of the port authority. There is some traffic in front of the hotel but I saw few buses and anything was rarely moving fast enough to make any noise due to proximity to traffic light and traffic. Perhaps it is louder on lower floors and/or facing another direction. I'm not sure what people expect in NY but there is nothing unsafe about this location. There is one or two adult bookstores on the block but never did I encounter anyone loitering and feel uncomfortable at any of the day or late night. Well located to attractions, dining, subway and Times Square. Best to walk 1/2 block to 8th or 9th to get a cab. They were not easy to find in front of the hotel. FInally, this place is great if you are traveling in or out of Newark airport. Very close to the tunnel and you can get a one way charter bus on Coach USA for $15. Door to door in under 40 minutes.Rooms - nice decor with minimalist approach to decorating. Beds were very comfortable and clean. Flat screen tv, clock radio with mp3 connection, plenty of outlets to plug things in. Bathroom lacks counter space as do most in Manhattan. Strangest thing to me was having the turn water pressure all of the way on to get hot water. The flat bottom sink would splash everywhere so use caution if you are fully dressed. Great glass shower with good pressure and lots of space. In room safe, iron and ironing board all in good working order. Two free bottles of water per day and wired/wireless internet included throughout the hotel. Yes - the room is small as most are in NYC. If you sit at the desk across from the bed, another person cannot pass behind you. You just dont get square footage in the city so I dont factor this as a negative.Hotel - did not use the gym. Lounge is small counter up front for breakfast and drinks in the evening with a tv for sports or news. Did not order room service or use small restaurant on premise so I cannot speak to food. All common areas were were cared for and clean.Not much negative to say about this hotel. If you can get a fair rate for this brand, it certainly is a little gem for business or pleasure."
5,1810,"Nov 4 2009 	lousy location makes this one to avoid	If you're nostalgic for the Times Square of porn shops and liquor stores, Four Points is up your alley. Those establishments, and the busy Port Authority bus station, make this area busy and seedy. Rooms are new and clean, with comfortable beds. Service is ok, though they didn't clean my room until almost 5pm. With so many better choices in NYC and Times Square area, don't bother unless rates are really low."
6,1810,"Nov 1 2009 	Great location	Nice hotel in a good location, right across from the Port Authority bus station and two blocks from Times Square."
7,1810,"Oct 31 2009 	Good Location Loud Slow Internet	The proximity to Times Square, Hells Kitchen, and the Bus Terminal are convenient. But it results in the hotel being pretty loud. The rooms are clean, modern, and pretty much no-frills. Beds are comfy. Internet is next to worthless, the few times i was able to get on, i ran a speed test with the resulting max download speed at 4.3kbs (modem from 1991). If you are a business traveler who needs a hotel with connectivity, don't stay her. If you are going to shows on broadway, or want to see the city and stay someplace cheap, this would be a good location."
8,1810,"Oct 29 2009 	Fantastic stay	We're just back from a 3-night stay at this hotel. We were lucky enough to have a room on the 20th floor so noise wasn't a problem at all (sign up to be a SPG member, it's free and you're more likely to get a room high up). From the 20th floor we had a nice enough view with no noise. The bed was the most comfortable bed I slept in and I already miss it! The room was a good size, neither small nor big and very clean.There's also a computer downstairs but the internet connection is quite slow. The complimentary bottle of water was a nice touch.In terms of the area, I knew that some reviews said that it was a shabby area. My husband didn't. I didn't tell him until we left, that every single day we passed the Parole office and two adult stores and he was actually surprised and never noticed them! I really don't think that the neighbourhood is that bad. OK it's not like in the upper west side but for the price we paid for the hotel ($440 all taxes included for 3 nights) it was really good value for money with a great room with virtually most of the metro stations within 2 to 10 minutes walk.Ooh and we also went on the roof, 34th floor, great view on Jersey, and the times square area!"
9,1810,"Oct 28 2009 	Comfy beds! The neighborhood is not that seedy but it is noisy so bring your ear plugs!	My boyfriend and I came for an event at that Marriott Marquis, but they were booked on Wednesday and Thursday, so we had to look for alternate lodging where we could use our SPG points. The closest available hotel was the Four Points Midtown.I read the reviews and was a little concerned about the neighborhood, but figured it was only two nights and you are basically just there to sleep, right?I believe this hotel went through a renovation not long ago, so the outside and lobby look new. The lobby is small with a small concierge desk, check-in desk and a tiny bar/coffee lounge to the right.Check in was pretty quick and we headed up to room 903....The room was simply remodeled, but you could tell that it was an old, remodeled room, if that makes sense. It's small...there isn't room for two people to walk between the end of the bed and the deks at the same time. We had a king bed (which I must say was VERY comfortable, along with the pillows and linens - by far the best feature in the room!) with two nightstands; an armoire to hang your clothes and housed the safe, iron and ironing board and coffee maker; a desk with chair, a flat panel TV and a side chair and lamp. The bath was very small and plain, but did the job. Not fancy. but clean and like I said, the bed was fantastic!At this point I was pretty happy with the hotel, and we went out exploring...SO - onto the 'hood - don't let the reviews saying that it's a seedy neighborhood and that it's unsafe scare you....it's really not that bad! Directly across the street is the Port Authority with buses coming in and out most hours of the day - so expect noise. Quite a lot of it actually.Yes, and just a few steps out the door of the hotel and to the right is a Parole Office but I honestly never saw anyone hanging around there. Nor did I see any shady looking characters hanging around the Adult DVD stores. Just keep walking by and you'll be fine...It's about a 5-10 minute walk to Times Square, depending if you hit stoplights or not (and how fast you walk!) There are tons of convenience stores, restaurants (fast food and sit-down) and a Starbucks on the way.We didn't have any issues with the air conditioning/fan, our water temperature or pressure - or anything else funky for that matter.So far so good, right?...until we went to bed. Oh Lord! It was so loud that I kept getting up to check to make sure the window wasn't open! I am somewhat of a light sleeper, but typically when I'm traveling and I walk many, many miles in a day, I crash pretty hard. But it didn't matter how tired I was, I absolutely couldn't get to sleep because of the noise - mostly coming from the Port Authority across the street. Luckily I remembered I had some ear plugs so I popped those in and managed to get about 5 hours of sleep. Now, I have to say that my boyfriend is a very heavy sleeper and could fall asleep on a tarp in the middle of a construction site, so he didn't have any problems. Perhaps the noise wouldn't be as bad on a higher floor? My suggestion would be to avoid the street side on the 9th floor - unless you sleep like my boyfriend! Or have ear plugs.With that....Overall, even with the noise, I think this hotel is a good value for it's location. Feel free to contact me with any questions...Happy Travels!LisaMpls"
10,1810,"Oct 26 2009 	Above average hotel in great location	Having been to NY at least a dozen times before, I have stayed in various locations in the city depending on what I was going there for. This time was for a quick 1 night to see a show with a friend, so decided that we really didn't want to be more than a 5-10 minute walk to Times Sq. area. This hotel fit perfectly!As others have mentioned, the location is great - 5 mins. to TS and theatre district, but some may be a bit put-off by the semi-sketchy street/neighborhood where it's located (ie adult book store, Port Authority bus station). But don't let that scare you! It was perfectly fine and we, as 2 woman traveling alone, didn't feel threatened or awkward. It's NY after all - full of all kinds of characters, but that's the charm.The interior of the hotel was nice - simply furnished and functional, with the MOST comfortable beds and pillows. Really! Our room was located on the 16th floor and had a lovely view. The staff, from Reception to Concierge, to Room Service, were all exceptionally nice.Just a couple of other nice features in the room: window that opens just a bit, an Ipod docking station to play music, bottled water and large flat-screen tv.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and would certainly suggest this hotel to others."
11,1810,"Oct 21 2009 	Small clean enough. Didn't like the neighborhood at all.	From my hotel window, I see the buses of the Port Authority Bus Terminal on 9th Avenue. Times Square isn't close, but if I walk by five or six Adult DVD shops, two massage parlors, and a peep show booth, I think I'll get eventually get there."
12,1810,"Oct 19 2009 	Worth considering if you can get it cheap	The Four Points Times Square is in a great location (if you want to stay in midtown), the rooms are well appointed and the staff are friendly. You get a cool flatscreen tv on the wall, the beds are super comfortable and there's a small gym in the basement. They deserve respect for offering free wifi and free bottled water.On the down side - and it's hard to quantify exactly why - I was put in mind of the &quot;Linton Travel Tavern&quot; during my stay... I just found it a bit depressing. (Big caveat to the following comments is that they probably apply to many Manhattan hotels) The rooms are quite small, the building is wedged in pretty tight to those around so you look out your window and find yourself staring someone in the face who's doing the photocopying in the office opposite, small corridors, cheap products in the bathroom, smell of stale cigarettes in corridors and lifts/elevators etc.As others have observed, the beds are very comfortable although I was bitten all over my right arm during one night so it appears that there were a few &quot;house guests&quot; in the room...Overall it's fine and if you get a good deal then it would serve you well for a stopover or short stay; especially if you don't expect any nice surprises or cleverly thought out design details."
13,1810,Oct 17 2009	I love the Sheraton Hotels	The hotel was recently remodeled I believe. The room was small but had all the amenities needed. The Sheraton beds are the best!! The staff was quite helpful &amp; friendly. The food in the restaurant was also wonderful. The one negative is that the shower head is placed too high. Standing on my tipee toes I still had difficulty moving it. I am 5'4&quot;.
14,1810,"Oct 15 2009 	Got a great deal	The hotel front staff weren't very friendly, but for the price and location it was a great place to stay. The room was cleaned and very comfortable. I would stay there again and would reccomend to friends."
15,1810,"Oct 13 2009 	Friendly staff	Good location close to Bus terminal with buses from Newark airport for only 25 $ roundtrip, nice rooms with excellent beds, friendly staff. We stayed here 5 adults and 1 child in 2 rooms. Loved it.The only thing is the pornstores on the way to the hotel, but it was ok anyway,not much action going on around them anyway."
16,1810,"Oct 11 2009 	Efficient and comfortable in good location	I spent my 1st and last night at this hotel in NYC. I found it to be clean and serviceoriented. The rooms were nice, typical size for NYC, functional, with nice work area withfree WIFi and coffee and tea maker in room. Lovely soft bathrobe with slippers. I was able to fit my lap-top into the in room safe which was great. I stayed in a King room and also in a 1 bedroom suite which was very nice."
17,1810,Oct 8 2009 	Only OK!	We stayed here for three nights Oct 1-4th. The room was clean granted but very small even for NYC standards. I have been in NYC 3x before at three different hotels and all were much roomier. The maid service was poor...staff threw out receipts left neatly stacked on the night stand and did not replace the plastic glasses. The bathroom was very tiny. Great for a one person stay but definitely not more then 2 per room. Very close to everything. The Bus terminal was very handy as direct transport to the Bruce Springsteen concert at Giants Stadium in NJ was from there. Did not feel unsafe at all getting to/from the hotel. Staff were generally friendly but seemed like they were spaced out most of the time and did not know answers to basic questions. The best rate we fund was for 208/ngt and the only reason we stayed here was for a fee night offered to us by SPG.
18,1810,"Oct 6 2009 	Great value /totally safe area	We booked with the re-opening deal of $115 per night. That in itself, made the stay great, but we were plesantly surprised with the size of the room and the great view. We could see Times Square from our room. Our room was very clean and the beds were great.I see some reviews mention the adult stores on the streets. Yes, they were there, however I never once felt unsafe. I loved the fact that Times Square was a block away. The Port Authority Bus Terminal was across the street which was kind of handy because there were lots of affordable resturants and shops. Not a bad deal. This hotels grand re-opening deal allowed my family to extend our vacation and I will stay here again!"
19,1810,"Oct 5 2009 	Fatal Errors	For all of the good things one can say about this relatively new hotel (eg, incredibly comfortable beds, smart design for such small rooms, friendly staff), there are a couple of major problems that make it impossible to stay here again.First is the air-conditioning. As previous reviewers have noted, when the cool (or hot) air kicked in, the sound was so loud that I was awakened every 5-10 minutes during the night. There is NO option to keep the fan on when the cool or warm air is also desired (which would at least keep the noise at a constant level). How could a new hotel adopt such an antiquated system? And why does using the TV remote turn the a/c off??Second is the in-room internet. Yes, it is free, but in this case you get what you pay for. The wired option is so slow that doing any work was all but impossible (staff advised that too many people are on the system and suggested that I go down to the business center to work). The connection was non-existent for the wireless option. I stayed for 4 nights and not once was the connection &quot;normal&quot; (much less high-speed, as advertised).I leave this hotel both tired and frustrated."
20,1810,"Sep 28 2009 	clean reasonable convenient but nothing exceptional.	Stayed for just the lasy night (of a 5-night trip) with my partner. It was a very clean, reasonably-priced, room that was really conveniently located. I didn't mind the somewhat grungy 'hood, but felt the hotel could have been better 'formatted' for its location including not having such a massive bed in such a time room and a more efficiently designed lobby to cater to the small size of the lobby and the large number of guests.Still, I'd stay again if the price was right."
21,1810,"Sep 27 2009 	Clean Hotel Location is both Good and Bad	I arrived at the hotel at 9:00 am after an overnight flight from Asia. Check-in went smoothly, and they got me into a room with a 15 minute wait which was great! I am a Platinum member so not sure this was the reason why, but was a very nice start of the trip. Other than this, never talked to the staff of the hotel as I didn't need anything.Rooms: Perfect for NYC. Small, but very functional. TV was a good size (I would guess 32 or 36&quot;) which is plenty big for a small room. Comfortable bed, and everything was new. The only issue I would say is the in wall air conditioner, which is very loud when needed. Luckily, the weather was fairly cool during my stay so used the fan only mode mostly. But I think if I needed the A/C all the time, it would have been very annoying.Location: Great if you use public transportation. Almost every subway you need is right around the corner (a half city block). You do need to walk in front of the NY Probation office, but quite frankly, it's fine. I walked alone at all times of day and night and never felt an issue. Now if you walk away from the subway station to 9th Avenue, that's a little more sketchy, but only because they are doing a ton of construction work and you end up in these little tunnel walkways. The worst thing about this location is there are very few cabs that travel down 40th. I think it has something to do with the construction or the traffic patterns, but taxis don't like this as a crosstown route. So if taking a lot of taxis are in the cards, keep this in mind. I used a car service to get to the airport because I wasn't confident that I could get a taxi at 5:00am when I had to leave (I had a ton of luggage and didn't feel like walking 1/2 block at 5 in the morning).The hotel offered free internet service, but it was very slow. I guess you get what you pay for!"
22,1810,Sep 22 2009 	GREAT HOTEL	lovely clean hotel in an excellent location.port authority is right across the street as is a 24 store/chemest.theres a lovely cafe in the port authority for breakfast as the food in the hotel is pricey. the rooms are small enough but perfect if you were just showering and sleeping there as we did.the t.v in the room was great even if the remote kept switching on the very noisy air con.the bed was the most comfortable ever but the pillows were way too soft with no support and they didnt offer an alternative for people who need support from their pillow. the bar in the hotel isnt really a bar its a small alcove to the side of the reception area with approx. 3 tables. We had asked for a room with just a shower &amp; no tub but they gave us one with a tub.I made a 10 minute phonecall to ireland and it cost $93.00 yes thats NINTY THREE DOLLARS. some reviews say the area was a bit dodgy but i dont agree.o.k there are a few xxx shops but the windows are covered and no one hangs around outside and there cops everywhere in n.y so we felt pretty safe. upon checkout there was an issue with the amount we had already prepaid and the manager did very little to resolve the situation infact she point blank lied to our faces which really let down such a nice hotel but i would definatly stay here again and again.
23,1810,"Sep 19 2009 	Incredible bang for your buck in a super central (albeit seedy for the suburban traveler) location	Summary: For the introductory rate of $115 that I paid, the value was beyond expectations for such a central location in Manhattan. The hotel is less than three months old, which makes it one of the newer and cleaner hotels in NYC.Rooms: The brand new rooms were a reasonable size for two adults and immaculately clean, especially the all-white bathrooms which seemed to sparkle when the lights were on. The bed was top notch, and the desk was actually designed for life in this century . . . meaning the TV was mounted on the wall and there were more power outlets built into the desk than I had plugs for. The desk even had built in USB connections!Location: The location is flawless if you are a leisurely tourist (right next to Times Sq and abundant subway lines and cabs), though some of the adult shops and grungy street characters on the block may turn off suburban visitors who haven't experienced much of NYC. Overall, a great 'base' to for your sightseeing or nightlife excursions.Service: For a select service hotel, not bad at all. I called down for extra Seattle's Best coffee (yum), bottled water (free), and toothpaste on separate occasions and they were all brought up within ten minutes or so. The housekeepers were friendly and did a great job making the room comfortable after returning from a long day of walking. While some of the staff seemed new, what do you expect? It's a brand new hotel!Cleanliness: Like I said, brand new hotel. It doesn't get any cleaner than this in NYC. I just hope a year from now the cleanliness doesn't start to slide.Value: After reading the above sections on my experience, what would you say the value was for a $115 rate? :-) I know it was an intro rate, but the experience I had was worth well more than $115 . . . maybe in the upper $100's I'd say, or lower $200's during peak dates.Other comments: The lobby area was a bit crammed. There is a circular seating area which takes up half of the lobby space and creates an obstructing wall in the lobby. At times it got claustrophobic with all the tourists and their luggage, but the reception desk agents did a good job greeting guests and checking them in efficiently."
24,1810,"Sep 12 2009 	Awesome Place for an AWESOME Price!	We also got in on the opening rate through travelzoo for 115.00. We loved our room. We were on our first trip to New York and everything so great!!!! Yes the port authority was acrossed the street but it was the back side of the building and no people . Yes there was an adult dvd store but there was on many streets we walked down. There was also a parole building but only one time when we walked passed it was it even opened. So I do believe all the complaints are truly from people who just like to complain. We loved the proximity to everything. We loved News York.We were amazed by all the things to see and the closeness of the subway and Times Square. Not far from the theatres and it was great. We had never seen hotels built so tall and skinny. All the staff was so helpful and we really apreciate all their help. They were all so willing. So, we are totally going to recommend this place to stay. Our room was on the 15th floor and we were just above the port authority and we loved everything. It really was a great room and an awesome price. Thanks travelzoo for offering it! Room was really clean , beds were really comfy and so were pillows.Everything was new and really nice. Elevators were fast. We really had a great experience. Our friends who went with us were on the 13th floor to the back of the building and they loved their room too!They had a handicap accessible room and it was clean and nice. We were also left 1 water bottle in our room when we arrived. But the next day we were given 2 bottles.Thanks Four points for the wonderful stay and we will someday make our way back to the big city! Big difference from the rural town we are from. Little Italy was so cool as was China town. We went to the yankees game where Jeter tied with Gherig. We went on a cruise to see the sites of the city and it was awesome. Went down wall street and through central park. There was so much more we could have seen just not enough time.Loved it all and will be back!"
25,1810,Sep 10 2009	Would stay here again without question!	After reading several reviews I was really worried about staying here with my senior citizen mother. There was nothing to worry about- Yes the street had XXX Dvd stores on it and a Parole Center (which was only open during the day) on it but I saw those types of things everywhere in New York. Very close to TImes Square. Great Price- Only complaint was we tried to go to the resturant in the hotel and could not get service. There were busy so that was really not a big deal. Alex got us a private car to take us to the airport and was really helpful. We came home afterdark one evening around 11 from a night tour and didn't feel the least bit scared walking down the street.
26,1810,"Sep 7 2009 	Great Hotel	We went during the promotion pricing and we were really amazed at this hotel. Yeah like a few people said... it's about 1 1/2 blocks into the ghetto area (which half of NYC is). But its really about 2 blocks away from Times Square. Point being is that it's close to the subway, food, shopping, and amazing entertainment. The hotel was nice, staff was friendly, location is great! I definately recommend this hotel and will be using this again in a few months. The internet was a little slow at times but get real... if you are going to NYC, you aren't going to sit in a hotel room much. Use this hotel!"
27,1810,Sep 7 2009 	Nice but would not stay again	The hotel is very clean and new. The hotel is on a street across from the bus terminal. We felt safe walking to and from the hotel until we were leaving for the airport. We had to leave for the airport at 5:00 am. When we went downstairs we asked the man at the front desk about getting a taxi and he said we would have to walk to the corner and go in front of the bus terminal. We had to walk with our luggage there. It is a short walk but at that time of night it seemed like alot of shady people were hanging out in front of the bus station and we felt very uncomforatble and not safe. The hotel is on a one way alley and there are no taxis riding down it unless they are dropping someone off at the hotel.Unfortunately because of the taxi issue I will not stay again.
28,1810,"Sep 4 2009 	Great value for promo price in Midtown	Exceptional bedding and very comfortable new beds, internet and business centerw/ printer for boarding passes a plus. Small rooms typical in size for NYC,no view. Broken coffee maker replaced upon request. Free bottled wateris one bottle per day for a room accommodating up to 4 people. Dirtystreet, adult toy store, scaffolding acceptable tradeoff for proximityto Times Sq and Broadway. Lines to check in. Tiny congested lobby butclean and new. Friendly staff. Initially told reserved room w/ two double bedswas not available and that I would have to either share a bed with mygrown son or opt to have one sleep on a chaise. I pushed the issue and got the roomreserved well in advance and guaranteed with a deposit.First night, maid service didn't happen until 9pm. We were told theywere running a bit behind. This wasn't a horrible thing and late checkout privileges more than compensated since ability to shower middaybefore heading out during brutal August heat wave was priceless!Floors tiny, elevators slow, everyone required to travel to thebasement for ice machine.Not worth current pricing of $255 per night given immediate competitionin the area with better aesthetics. Would return in a heartbeat for thepromo rate."
29,1810,"Aug 31 2009 	Good hotel. Would certainly stay again.	I stayed here for two nights last week with my 10-year-old son. We too booked at the Travelzoo rate of $115. I am sorry we didn't stay longer. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable! The staff was friendly and most went out of their way to help us. There are adult book/DVD stores on the block but the windows are covered and the only thing you see is the words &quot;Adult DVD's.... The Port Authority Bus Terminal so close was good. There are many places to eat there for reasonable prices and since they are open 24/7 there are always people around including police officers. I am a single mom, my son and I walked back to the hotel after 11:30 each evening and never felt unsafe. I would have felt unsafe in an area where there are fewer people around on the street. I would certainly stay here again if it were a good rate. If I were going to pay $300 a night I would probably stay in a larger hotel with more amenities."
30,1810,"Aug 30 2009 	convenient and safe	As others have noted, the hotel is next to the port authority bus terminal and 2 short blocks to times square and within walking distance of grand central, fifth avenue, central park south, all broadway theaters, etc. Really a great location. The street is unattractive, but quite safe. The hotel is brand new, so the furnishings and bathroom were nice and the beds (2 doubles for us) were very comfortable. However, the air conditioner sounded like a jet taking off every time the condenser came on. It was ridiculously loud (how can this be with brand new equipment) and woke me more than once during the night. This is really something they need to address. I ahve not had such loud air conditioning in any of the 20 or so other hotels I have stayed in around New YorkCity, including the Times Square area, including very comparable hotels to this, such as Hilton Garden Inn or Doubletree."
31,1810,"Aug 28 2009 	Good choice and location. Free internet!	Like the other recents reviews, I found this place via Travelzoo ($115 USD / night), and you just can't complain regarding those prices for a new hotel. I'm not going to repeat the same things mentioned, so I'll just mention good value eats:Middle-Eastern street vendors - sells styrophome container of lamb or chicken, and rice for only $5. Popeye's Chicken on 40th btw 7th &amp; 8th Ave - nuggets are $2-3, and 3-piece chicken meal is $3."
32,1810,"Aug 26 2009 	Neither Great nor Terrible	A great deal on Travelzoo led us to this new hotel. We would agree with some of the things we had read on TripAdvisor before staying there and disagree with others.First, the hotel isn't on the best street in NYC. There is a huge bus terminal (NY Port Authority) across the street and a few places on the street I wouldn't want to take children to see, as some have said. But we never felt unsafe. In fact, NYC felt very safe throughout; police officers were everywhere, including one or two on the corner of 40th St. and 8th Ave., near the hotel, almost everytime we walked by. On the other side, 9th Ave. had many good restaurants. We also found advantages to being close to the Port Authority. Inside are good places for breakfast and coffee, below is a subway station, and outside were taxis all the time. In other words, we were able to get a good coffee and pastry in the morning and then travel to anywhere in the city we wanted. We also liked the fact that we could easily walk to the theatre district. We saw two major plays on 45th St., just five to ten minutes away.Second, the service was hit and miss. A few employees were very helpful, and a few didn't seem too responsive to requests. One thing that especially bothered us was when we wanted our sheets changed the first night (because of strange hairs in the bed), they only changed the top sheet. This happened twice. We finally got the sheets and changed the thing ourselves. Besides that, the bed was very, very comfortable. I must also give the hotel credit for storing our baggage for free on the day we checked out. This allowed us to see more of the city before our night flight. Finally, the hotel was nice and new, but the room was small; the bed took up most of the space.Overall, we were happy with the low price we paid to stay in Manhattan (the value for the money), but we wouldn't have been happy if we had paid much more."
33,1810,"Aug 24 2009 	Very Nice hotel-don't listen to the bad reviews.......	Contrary to a lot of other people, we really liked this hotel. Pros:- location: close to (1 avenue, and 2 blocks) away from Times Square- price: paid $115.00 intro rate, excellent- room: not too small (2 double beds). GREAT COMFY bed! WOW!- nice staff, allowed early check-in- good restaurant onsite Cons:- XXX shops down the street- probation office next door Explanations:  The XXX shops are nearby, but they were all over Manhattan, as were homeless people and liquor stores. The probation ofice was so non-descript that I didn't know what it was until coming home and reading about it on other people's reviews. It must have closed by 4 or 5 pm, as I didn't see anyone near it after the dinnerhour. Face it, you're going to New York, it is going to look, smell, and appear exactly as New York. does. I'm happy to have stayed in Manhattan for under $150.00/night. To have done it at a new hotel, and to be close to Times Square was a bonus! When I travel to New York and want more space and peaceful surroundings, I stay in Secaucus, New Jersey. That may be a more suitable alternative for some people. Our 10 year old wasn't scared or phased, his only comment was &quot;there's a lot of hobo's here&quot;, which was a reference to NYC in-general. We also have a lot of homeless in Toronto, as (unfortunately) a lot of larger cities do. Go to the Four Points and enjoy!"
34,1810,"Aug 24 2009 	Courteous Staff well appointed room parole division one door down	Clean and courteous, on 40th and 8th, 4 Points Sheraton Times Square is a few blocks down from Times Square. Rooms are clean and nicely furnished. Be careful of a few things: It is directly across from Port Authority ( a multi story bus station), and one door down from the NY Division of Parole. Police are present in the area and it is overall safe. The guest can be noisy in the hall which can be heard in the room. I was awoken several times. A/C is noisy but necessary in the summer and can interrupt light sleepers. There are only 3 elevators all going to the top floors. At times I had to wait quite a while to get a lift. There are computers available for use, but the internet is slow. I got a great rate, but did need to be flexible."
35,1810,"Aug 23 2009 	Good hotel - street kind of scary	We always winced a bit when walking back to the hotel after dark - walking by the NY Probation Department fortress NEXT door! did not help. Hotel was very nice inside, staff were good. Location was good."
36,1810,"Aug 21 2009 	Stay away!!!	My husband and I will NEVER stay here again! This was our ten year anniversary. We had a horrible view of a pigeon poop stained building and right across the street from the port Authority transit building. The staff was completely incompetent. They charged our room to the wrong credit card. I gave them a card for &quot;incidentals&quot; and was assured the charge would come off in a few days. Two times I went to the front desk and questioned them about this. They never looked up my information, the inexperienced staff assured me both times, the charges would be released. They acted like new freshman high school kids not knowing what to say. The money never came off!! I called later, she told me it had been released. So I called the bank......no! So I called back and find out they charged almost my entire room to the &quot;incidentals&quot; card. When you give your credit cards to a hotel (complete strangers), you expect them to be professional, accurate, and to know what they are doing! I am trying to keep track of my money on this trip!!! I am very unhappy with this place. It is cheaper for a reason. It's not about which card it went on...it's the principle. They lied and never checked, then they lied a second time and never checked...or were just stupid. Also, porn shops right next door and nasty liquor shops."
37,1810,"Aug 18 2009 	Newer hotel with night construction	Hotel staff was friendly and the hotel was new and comfortable. The neighborhood was sketchy with adult stores and a parole building close by. We got a good nightly rate of $115/night. However there was night time construction across the street.......needless to say, we did not sleep well, of course the hotel did not prewarn. Those who like a nice sleep....please be careful! Room service was questionable"
38,1810,"Aug 17 2009 	Good deal for Times Square	My boyfriend got the opening offer of getting a room for $115 per night. When I first came here to read the reviews about the hotel, I thought it would be located in a very sketchy area and that I would be freaking out if we were going back to the hotel really late. When we first arrived at the Port Authority bus terminal, we must say that it is amazing as it is only across (not even 5 minute of walking). The area does look sketchy with tons of adult shops, but it's somehow safe. We stayed there for 5 nights, and every night, when we were walking back to the hotel, there are cops at the corner of 8th Avenue and 40th Street. So, we did not feel unsafe at all. Only 1 avenue away from Times Square and you have subway stations all close to the hotel. Can't complain much. To us, it was like normal NYC. I wouldn't know how it would feel like if I went with a bunch of girlfriends only, but I think as long as we're at least two people together, it would be fine.The room was a bit tiny, and I was seeing spider web behind the bathroom door. The carpet in the room was a bit weird, we haven't noticed it until the last day, when the sofa was pulled a bit away from the wall. But it's nothing major. The king size bed was amazing. Haven't really tried the wireless, but the two computers provided by the hotel at the lobby were really slow. The iHome dock in our room was working fine. No view as we were staying on the 3rd floor, due to early check-in. We didn't want to wait until 3pm. The A/C was somehow really really loud. At some point, we did find the A/C a bit annoying. But whatever, again, nothing major. We haven't tried the restaurant at the lobby and didn't have the chance to go get a drink at the bar (although we were offered a 2-for-1 drink when we checked in). Apparently, it is opened until 6pm (if I remember well)."
39,1810,Aug 16 2009 	Great Hotel	The neighborhood is safe. i wouldn't have any problems walking outside at 2AM. Sure there's a shelter across the street and a parole office next door. I wouldn't stand in front of the hotel taking pictures. But half a block away is the New York that most people would recognize. If you can get past the grittiness outside the door you'll find a gem of a hotel to stay in. Almost new as of this writing. Super comfortable beds. Great showers and bathrooms. Slightly smaller rooms typical of New York. For the price (about $200) this is a great place to stay.
40,1810,"Aug 15 2009 	If you get a good deal this is a steal	Stayed at the hotel in August 2009 for 4 nights. Traveled with my spouse, 22 year old daughter and 11 year old son. I was very concerned about the location especially with some of the reviews I read regarding the hotel's location since you must pass a couple of adult bookstores and a parole department. However, the location was fine. There were no scary people loitering about I hardly noticed the parole department. There was a cop usually on the corner of the street which is not unusual since there are all over the times square area. We just walked quickly to the hotel and even if we hadn't I don't think it would have been scary at all. No one bothered us at all. I don't think this is an issue at all and would not be concerned about recommending the hotel. Now, regarding the hotel itself, the beds were the most comfortable I have every slept in. The rooms were clean and I felt like for New York the rooms were a good size. We weren't tripping over lugagge. The only thing I felt misled on was the fact that the hotel says they give free bottled water. In actuality, they only provide ONE small 16 oz. bottle per day. I didn't expect them to provide a bottle each day for the four of us in the room, but one bottle seemed stingy and misleading from what they advertise. I think two bottles a day would make a better impression. If two people stayed in the room for example, couldn't they cough up enough water for at least the two of them to have their own bottle? If they don't want to do this they shouldn't advertise that the room comes with free bottled water. It seems like a deliberate ploy. Overall, if you get a good price, I would recommend this hotel. TIP: If you buy tickets from the TKTS booth, count the money in your hand BEFORE you give it to the person behind the counter. The TKTS clerk stole money from me because I was counting it out as I slid it through the window. MISTAKE!!!! Don't take your eyes off them for a moment when you hand them money."
41,1810,"Aug 13 2009 	Poor Location	I stayed at this hotel for the weekend, with my family. I had arrived in the city, with my child early, as I wanted to check in early, and go too chinatown. Before I arrived at the hotel, I got lost, thanks to my google maps, which was on my cell phone. I rang the hotel, to get directions, and Nicholle who i spoke too, had no clue, in giving me the right location, of the hotel. The street that the hotel is on, is horrible, there is men working, and awful rated R dvd stores. But when you take a right out of the hotel, at the end of the street, you have the subway, the New York Times Building, a very clean and large drug store across the road. And also you have the bus station near, as well. Its a very short walk too Times Square, which is great. If you want too go to Central Park, we took the sub, which is quick, but dirty..We also went too the Bronz Zoo, which was great.. Overall I may stay here again, as I know the location..And my husband loved the bed, the bathroom was small, the toileties were great, you get a bottle of water, in your room, free intnet downstairs...Coffee maker also in the room, and great bedroom slippers. The only issue, that my husband also didn't like you have to go to the basment, to get the ice. Also the he thought the bar tender, who was on a Friday night, who was female, was rude, and didn't serve him, she said she was not serving any more drinks, but yet she was still serving the two gentlemens, at the bar..Nicholle who checked me in, who was not that great, not very knowable, and I did sign up, to be a starwards perferred guest, she did not explained the program at all. But we did have a great time, in the city, I love New York."
42,1810,"Aug 10 2009 	Very clean but area surrounding the hotel is a bit shady	Although we had trouble with our reservation at first, all was taken care of by a very nice gentleman at the front desk. We were allowed to check in early, which was a bonus, as we were headed to a 2:30 pm Broadway show (all of them are walking distance from this hotel).The hotel was new, clean and well appointed. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was bigger than others we have seen in NYC.We had a very nice view from our room.The area in and around the hotel was a bit &quot;shady&quot; after dark, however, we did not feel too uncomfortable walking around. Still, it needs a clean up!!Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you can get it at a good price, which we did ($115 introductory rate)."
43,1810,"Aug 10 2009 	A steal for the location	This was my fourth visit to NYC and my husband's first. I have only stayed on the Upper West Side before, and took the chance with the Times Square locale with the fantastic deal they were offering ($115/night - - check the hotel's actual website.) Although this area is definitely more &quot;gritty&quot; than the Upper West Side, the Times Square subway station gives you access to many lines that go all over the city. The room was very well appointed, and I never slept in a more comfortable bed - no kidding. There is a close subway station and a pharmacy/grocery right on the corner down the street to purchase snacks/maps, etc. The bus terminal was also right there, and we saw a few homeless types, but the patrolmen politely asked them to move on, which they did. The terminal, by the way, has a ton of low cost restaurants and snack shops also. It's also good to know a portion of Times Square is closed off on Sat. nights so pedestrians can fully take in the magnificence of it all. If you want to be close to Times Square and Broadway, this is a fantastic deal you shouldn't miss."
44,1810,Aug 9 2009 	good access to subway and times square brand new hotel location so so	also got the grand opening special of 115 dollars with taxes 135just off times square - only had problems once with riff raffbrand spanking newonly 8 rooms per floormy room looked greatbigger than i thought i would get for new yorkreally not much smaller than a hilton i stayed in in New jerseydesk with hookup/cable for laptop. don't even need to use the Wi figreat value but if i had more money i'd stay away from Times Square i think....i think i'd like more downtown 40th street has access to the Times square subway - like there is a subway entrance half a block from the hotel........A C E lines on the other side of 40th st is the bus terminalthere was also 2 computers for public use. 1 had a working printer so i could print my boarding passsmall fitness centre. didn't use it . didn't see anyone in itstaff: room made up nicelythe front desk staff have google.......when they don't know they can look it upi thought they tried hard when i had a concern
45,1810,"Aug 9 2009 	Beware of Booking online	We booked the hotel last minute (the night before our arrival) through booking.com. We also called the hotel directly to confirm that they had rooms available and were told if we could book it online, then there were rooms available. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that they did not have rooms for us and so we were stuck in NY with all our luggage and a 10 year old in tow. At first they told us that the booking was for October 4th, not August (the day we arrived). When we produced the booking confirmation the staff changed their story and told us that they had tried to call us that morning (we had no way of confirming this as we had been travelling to the hotel!). On a separate note, I would be wary of staying in this location again, especially with young children. The hotel was surrounded on both sides by &quot;adult&quot; stores and there were lots of seedy characters hanging around (even for NY!)"
46,1810,"Aug 6 2009	Mixed feelings	I have stayed in NYC a few times in different places. As others have said, the location is great as you are only a few blocks from times square. However, I have to agree that the walk to 8th St. is a little shady but its short...and not so scary that we would avoid walking there at night. We were two women alone and only once did we feel a little nervous. There were often police at the corner of 41st and 8th right down the street. The hotel bed is very comfortable and size of the room is fine - I have stayed in bigger and smaller. The overall service though is lacking. Housekeeping forgot to restock things for us daily and Room service also failed to show up on one occasion and forgot things on another. When we asked the front desk a question or two about getting back to the airport they were less than helpful. Another complaint would be the air conditioner. It was terrible! It was very loud and very strong. Overall I would recommend the hotel due to the price of $115US/night along with the comfort of the bed. Another tip - eat lunch at Schnippers at 41st and 8th in the bottom of the New York Times building. Great food!"
47,1810,"Jul 29 2009 	Decent but not anxious to return	This brand-new hotel is located close to 9th Avenue, with the Port Authority bus station across the street, and a number of adult shops just up the block. There is ongoing construction on the corner, which makes for noise whenever you leave the hotel (plus, you have to negotiate all the scaffolding). It is not a pretty block. However, the proximity to the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood is actually wonderful. Many great restaurants on 9th and 10th Avenues, and you can walk to the Hudson (where you can rent bicycles, walk along the riverfront, or visit the Intrepid battleship museum) in just a few minutes.The hotel itself is nice enough. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff, though, aren't of the &quot;go the extra mile&quot; breed. To be fair, the lobby is tiny, and it must be tough to manage guests in such a small space.In conclusion, it is a decent place to stay. We got a promotional rate and used points for a four-night stay, so we got a very good value. But if we weren't using points, I imagine we'd use Priceline to stay somewhere better."
48,1810,"Jul 29 2009 	Unlike others no complaints!	After reading the reviews for this hotel, I was skeptical but that was completely unwarranted. To those who have complained about the hotel's location, grow some thicker skin. The hotel is not in the greatest area but is by no means dangerous. Yes, there were a couple of homeless people in the vicinity of the hotel but they did not approach myself or my friends nor did they attempt to talk to us. The area surrounding the hotel has some great little restaurants and bakeries, a previous reviewer said to avoid 9th ave. but I completely disagree, there are so many great spots there!As for the hotel, it was very clean! Rooms were a good size for Manhattan and the bathroom was spotless. We were on a high floor so we had a nice view of the skyline. The staff was courteous at all times and a nice perk not mentioned is the fact that the hotel offers discounted parking ($24 per 25 hours) at a lot just up the block, all you have to do is have someone at the front desk validate your parking ticket. The wifi worked well throughout our stay and the complimentary water was a nice touch. All in all, great hotel in a great location close to Times Square but not directly in the hussle and bustle. Definitely worth the grand opening special of $115/night."
49,1810,"Jul 29 2009 	GREAT HOTEL IF PRICE IS RIGHT	Although the hotel is on the south side of the Port Authority Bus Terminal,the street is safe and hassle free. Taxis frequent this cut through street, so it is not a problem getting one quickly.Small, clean new hotel with easy access in and out.Polite, friendly, courteous staff who are all willing to help. Rooms are average size for a NYC hotel, but being that the hotel is brand new, made it more comfortable. Would recommend this hotel for singles or couples. Any price under $150 makes this hotel a bargain."
50,1810,"Jul 29 2009 	Good Value Great Location	Four Points Sherton Hotels are usually a decent quality, and good value. Thie was a brand new hotel, so new it wasn't on the Super Shuttle Hotel List. So if you go soon, make sure that you tell the company it is a new Four Points Hotel and the exact address so they don't get it mixed up with the other Four Points hotels in New York. We got a great rate on the room because of the Grand Opening special promotion. Only paid $125 plus tax per night. It couldn't be missed. But as people said, the room is small, I think it is only 200 sq feet. Get 2 queen beds in there and you don't have a lot of room to move. But if you are only sleeping there, it is adequate. Our only complaint about the size is that when I was sitting at the desk there was no room for a person to pass between the bed and the back o fthe chair. Oh, small closet too, but adequate number of shelves and drawers for other storage. The location is great as far as proximity to Times Square. The subway entrance is a half block walk. Times square is at your feet. But you do pass a couple of Adult Book Stores and the Probation Office. There is always a police officer at the corner (usualy day and night) But I noticed quite a few police officers all over times Square on this visit to NYC. I would definitely recommend this hotel, but if you have to pay more than $200 per night, check out some of the other in the area to compare. I think the Hilton Garden Inn rooms are bigger for the same price."
51,1810,Jul 27 2009 	Good value clean hotel	Hotel is good value with travelzoo promotion. Was very clean. Bar was not open at beginning of July. Location is not as bad as reviews suggest. Very close to subway and Times Square.
52,1810,"Jul 26 2009 	Nice Stay	We stayed at the Four Points for 3 nights in mid-July. I saw some less than favorable reviews for the location, and I was a little concerned. This is about 2 blocks from times square, but not a &quot;bad&quot; area. I didn't feel unsafe at any time walking to or from the hotel. The rooms were nice and new. They were a little on the small side, but we got a deal on the rate, so I wouldn't complain. Overall, we had a great stay. Never waited more than a couple of minutes for an elevator and all of the staff were very nice and helpful. Definitely convienant location, since you're only about a block from the subway and the bus terminal."
53,1810,"Jul 23 2009 	Will be back; Clean affordable 	I stayed here for one night during a very warm week in July. The aircon shuts down if you are out of the room for a while (motion sensors) but since they are brand new it cools the room down very quickly. The shower and bathroom were spotless and laid out nicely. The complimentary internet and bottled water are nice amenities; they also had an ipod docking radio which had decent sound. My king bed room on the 30th floor had a nice view of the Empire State building and city in general. It was very quiet and well decorated. Elevators were slow during peak use times, but never more than a 5 minute wait for me. The only ice / vending machines are in the basement which is slightly inconvenient. There was also a fitness center down there but I did not try it, nor did I try room service or the lobby lounge.I arrived at 12:30 and as others have stated no rooms were available and the small lobby was full of bags, which looked a little shabby. Had lunch on 9th Ave and then came back around 1:30 and was given my room, which was nice since check in is technically at 3.As for the area, it is fine- not Park Avenue, but certainly not dangerous in any way. It is close to multiple subway lines and cabs are plentiful. The airport express bus departs from the north side of PA bus terminal on 42nd, a cheap way to get to nyc airports.All in all it was a clean, affordable hotel in a great location for a quick visit to New York, no major complaints at all."
54,1810,"Jul 20 2009 	Nice hotel...but was not told of its exact location	When I booked 2 rooms for my husband and myself and 3 boys I was told by an SPG reward operator several things. First and most important, the hotel was located in Times Square, (across from the Westin). It is not! The area may be considered Times Square, but there is not much pedestrian traffic and what there is not reassuring. The hotel is actually beside the NYC bus terminal. The back of this building is the front view of the hotel. We had to walk our 3 boys down this dark street that looked like an alley with bars, homeless, and adult DVD stores. I did not FEEL SAFE walking on this street! Also the hotel has no connecting rooms, and only 2 double beds per floor. My husband and I split up so an adult was in each room with our kids.The beds were nice, and price was great... but I feel I was greatly misled by starwood. We definately got what we paid for. This is not a place I would EVER bring my kids back too. If you have kids please learn from our mistake and stay elsewhere--"
55,1810,"Jul 19 2009 	Needs more time to get into shape	VERy sketchy area, even in broad daylight!For value, ($115 intro rate was on-line, and heard about it on the elevator,)spent more on cabs, and had to walk to front of Port Authority to grab one, none came down narrow street. Nice beds and clean since brand new. Housekeeping inconsistent. No security, no doorman, front desk staff confused and unhelpful. different # soaps, towels, coffee cups in room each day. 3 elevators service entire 33 floors, with 8 rooms on each. Took 15 minutes 1 day to get down. I suggest walk if on lower floors. Bill upon checkout was only plus. Felt unsafe going to basement to get ice."
56,1810,"Jul 19 2009 	Mixed Feelings	I really have mixed feelings in regards to this hotel. I was fortunate enough to get the room at $115 per night with the Travelzoo promotions, which makes it a nice deal for the price. However, if I would have paid more for the room I think I would have regretted not going elsewhere. When I booked this room online it had recently opened and there were no reviews. Shortly after booking the reviews started coming in, there seemed to be a concern in regards to the location. I called the hotel due to the reviews I was reading, through our phone call the lady said that she put a block on my room and upgraded the room to the spg floor, and a better view. When we arrived at the hotel the rooms were not ready so they offered to hold our luggage for us. I mentioned to the lady about the assurance of this upgrade, the girl acknowledged this agreement. However, when we were able to check in we were put on a lower floor overlooking the bus terminal. I mentioned this to the hotel personnel and was first told that there were no rooms available, then I was told that a room was available a couple of floors higher up, then I was told that since I got the promotional rate through Travelzoo (and others having a higher tier of spg points) that others were given priority. The part that really bothers me is that I was promised one thing then they failed to deliver. On the 2nd day of our trip we came back to the room later in the evening and were surprised to see that the bed was not done nor the room cleaned (clean towels were left in the bathroom). The hotel was clean, most of the employees were courteous, the room was large enough for what we needed it for. The location isn't the best in the world and I would not recommend it as a place to stay for families with children or females traveling alone. I did notice that they have video stores in many areas, even around some of the 4-5 star hotels."
57,1810,"Jul 17 2009 	A very good find in all aspects - highly recommended	First of all: I really liked the hotel. My room was new and quite spacious (especially considering you're in New York City). The bed is the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper Bed, so basically you feel like you're sleeping on clouds. The hotel also features a restaurant, but didn't try it. Hotel offers free high-speed internet in the rooms, and has a small but efficient fitness room.Then the location: I had no problem with it. It's on West 40th St between 8th and 9th Avenue (tell the cab driver this, since the hotel is so new he might not know it. Hotel is on the right hand side if you come down 40th Street). Seriously, you're in New York City, you're bound to see stuff you don't see in your home town. I don't agree with other reviewers that it was seedy or uncomfortable. They make it sound as if you're descending into hell, which really isn't the case. I returned to my hotel after midnight and did not feel uncomfortable at all, since the area is well-lit. The hotel is right next to a Fairfield Inn by Marriott, and Times Square is a 10 minute walk. Bus Terminal is right around the corner, as is a Duane Reed drugstore, and the subway is very close as well. Taxi's aren't difficult to find on 8th Avenue, and it only took me 30 minutes to get to JFK by cab (45 dollars flat fee + 5 dollars toll).In all, I can really recommend it."
58,1810,"Jul 13 2009 	Great Hotel - Unfortunate Location	The hotel was great. I also received the amazing opening special rate of $115 so we decided to stay overnight in the city after watching the fire works. Our room was of a decent size for New York and the beds were fantastic. The decor was very nice and the front desk check in was courteous and pleasant. I don't have one complaint about the hotel itself. I would not recommend this location for families and those not familiar with NY. In this city one block can make a big difference. And at this location right next to the bus terminal, it does. There is a homeless mission and a more populated area of people who may make some uncomfortable. I would not have felt comfortable with just a girlfriend or my daughter. We saw a homeless man rip a flag out of a womans hair and almost pull out her hair. Im used to seeing homeless people in the city. What I am not used to is seeing them laying across the sidewalk apparently not breathing and a cop basically just walking over him. These were just 2 of the many sites a block over from the hotel. Stick with 8th Ave if you can. If you are a couple used to NY or a bunch of guys  no problem what so ever. And from what Ive been told they are trying to revitalize the Hells Kitchen area so it could get better in the future."
59,1810,"Jul 6 2009 	Definitely not family friendly	We booked two rooms in June 2009. On line I requested a crib which never arrived. The first night there was no hot water for our showers, the second there was no water pressure. They also forgot to mention the State of NY Parole Division was next door; not a pretty view. The rooms were ok but there was barely any room to walk. To close our stay there was no staff available at check out to help bring luggage down. We were told to come down to the lobby and get the cart ourselves. As we were checking out there was another unsatisfied family loudly expressing their concerns to the front desk staff."
60,1810,"Jul 6 2009 	Good deal in NYC	Found a openning special as a SPG member. Paid $115/night + taxes. Room was ready upon arrival (noon). Asked for a room that had a view of the Hudson River. Not a problem. Room was on 2Oth floor. Watched fireworks from the room. Nice room. Excellent king bed with good linens. Bathroom was small , but functional. Asked for extra towels which were delivered promptly. Free bottled water was included. Room was behind the elevator, but was quiet. Room darkening shades worked well. Safe in the room, coffeemaker with supplies, an ipod docking radio, and an HD tv. Everything was good except the airconditioner. It worked well, but was noisy. I had earplugs which I used...slept well. I would stay there again if the price was right. The seedy streetlife is just New York. Homeless people are in all parts of the city. Just ignore. I felt safe. The hotel has a restaurant which I did not try. Nearby is Lenny's and the Westway Diner . Both on 9th at 43rd. Good food and cheap."
61,1810,"Jun 30 2009 	Great price nice new room	I stayed a night on 6/28. When I tried to check in the small lobby was filled with bags and there was barely any room to stand. I proceeded to the SPG line and was told that no rooms were ready (this was 2:00 p.m.). Not a big deal since checkin wasn't until later. The woman at the front desk wasn't too friendly and seemed overwhelmed by all of the baggage in the lobby. I asked the front desk attendant to hold our bags and we came back around 6:00 p.m. and were able to check in. My room was on the 27th floor (the SPG floor) and had a view of the roof of Port Authority. The room was clean, new, and had a very comfy bed. The curtains didn't close properly, so we woke up very early the next morning due to all of the sunlight. The rooms have an iHome iPod dock/clock radio, but it didn't work.The elevators were dirty and made the worst creeking noises. We didn't have time to check out the gym. When I asked about upgrades, I was told that the suites were still under construction.As others have mentioned, this hotel isn't on the nicest block in the city. While it's not unsafe, it is unsavory with adult DVD stores and homeless people flanking the entrance.I would stay here again as the hotel was affordable, convenient, and clean."
62,1810,"Jun 28 2009 	Nice Hotel ... With Some Flaws	Just stayed here for four days with some friends. The hotel is nice and the rooms are pretty spacious for New York City travel. The only problem I had was what other reviewers said - it is down a sketchy side street with a lot of adult stores so we (four girls) did not feel safe walking at night (or the day in that area being hooted and hollered at). However, the hotel staff were very friendly in checking us in early and allowing us to leave our bags there until our room was ready. Granted the view was of the Port Authority station, the view was great from where we were! The lobby is a bit small and the bar area wasn't ready yet, but since it was only opened three weeks ago its okay. They were friendly about giving us extra towels and coffee, and even had razors for us since we didn't bring them on our flight.It is very close to Times Square and there are no worries about getting around NYC since you are near the Subway station. The staff is willing to help you get to your destination. GREAT (Cheap) pizza place right around the corner - 2 pieces of pizza and pop for $2.75 ... and it was good pizza! Other than that, no food IMMEDIATELY next to the hotel. Beds were soft, nice tv! Our iHome (ipod station) didn't work which was disappointing. Note there is a full size blow dryer so don't bring one! Wireless was great, although slow but can't complain for free internet! There are only eight rooms per floor so as soon as you step off the elevator ... BOOM your room is right there. But it was fairly quiet so we can't complain on that perspective. For four girls, and the low cost per night, we couldn't complain too much :)It was a problem getting a taxi since it is a size street so you had to walk to 8th Street which was somewhat annoying but dealable since there is a taxi stand right off of this street."
63,1810,"Jun 26 2009 	What the heck were they thinking?	You approach the hotel along a narrow, one-way street with no available (legal) parking. Opposite the property sits the eyesore that is the Port Authority Bus Terminal, while most of the rest of the hotels side of the block is occupied by adult video stores and peepshows. I didn't feel unsafe walking to or from the hotel, even relatively late into the evening, just be aware that it isn't a park.That said, the hotel itself is solid. The (tiny) rooms are well appointed with great beds. There were three of us in a double room, and you literally have to get on a bed to let someone walk past you. They are indeed that small. One ice machine serves the entire property, so no matter what floor you are on you have to elevator to the basement for ice.In the room itself, as I said, the beds are GREAT. Roller shades can either obscure the view, or provide very acceptable blackout for sleeping in. The internet is available via wireless or wired. It is painfully slow, but workable and free. In an indication that hotels finally are beginning to understand that we have things we need to plug in, there are available outlets everywhere!Dining is available downstairs, but at ~$15 for the average breakfast, do yourself a favor and walk one block east and stop in at the Teleon Cafe. Breakfast (and dinner) is cooked fresh and fast at a reasonable price.Summary? At around $150 for a new property this close to Times Square, jump on it. Just go in aware of the potential shortcomings."
64,1810,"Jun 22 2009 	Great deal in Times Square	This hotel was fantastic. My husband and I were going to NYC to attend the U.S. Open Golf tournament out on Long Island. We found this hotel from a hotel special email we received (as we are Starwood members). We booked it immediately figuring that with it being brand new, we couldn't go wrong. We were right. The hotel is very nice. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The block that it is on is definitely a side street in a big city (dingy, nothing pretty) but certainly not dangerous. We don't typically stay in Times Square when we go to NYC, but particularly with wanting to be near the train station to go to Long Island, the location was perfect. It's a brand new hotel, so even though they said the hotel was up and running, it was hard to tell, but it didn't matter as we didn't need a restaurant in the hotel. It looks as though a cute little bar area is about to open in the lobby area of the hotel. With the prices that they have been offering, this will definitely become a NYC staple for us. It suited our needs perfectly"
65,1810,"Jun 18 2009 	Good Deal in NYC	This hotel is brand new (less than a month old) and located on the corner of 8th Ave and 40th Street in Manhattan. Overall the block where the hotel is located is fairly dingy, but the hotel's location right in Midtown near all major subway lines makes it very convenient to all areas of Manhattan. Service was very friendly and as a new property the rooms were spotless and nicely decorated. The room was tiny, but fairly standard for New York. Be aware that rooms in the back of the hotel face an alley and have no views of any kind. Despite that, bedding was excellent and the free internet was a plus. For under $200, this hotel is a solid deal and perfect for a quick trip into the city."
66,1810,"Jun 17 2009 	Brand New Great Value Would Stay Again	I stayed here from June 8 - 10 and was pleasantly surprised at check in when I learned that the hotel had just opened a few days prior, and I was the first person to stay in the room. I got a rate of about $189/night, which I think is pretty good given the proximity to times square, the fact that you free get high speed internet, bottled water, and a great little room. The staff were all excellent, the room nicely appointed (but standard NYC small), and the gym was wonderful as well. The hotel is in a bit of a &quot;transitional&quot; area, meaning that there are some adult DVD shops a few hundred feet up the street, but you are also right there by the NY Times building, and 8th ave. I will definitely be back to this modern, affordable, boutique style hotel."

1,1815,"Nov 15 2009 	Moorish Zen in this NY-oasis	I've stayed in a lot of nice/luxurious/design/artyfarty/... hotels in my life, and I must say: The Greenwich Hotels has become a new favourite.Very stylish. Very relaxing. No cold NY-design. Gorgeous spa. The NY-answer to Hazienda Benazuza in Sevilla.My general advice: don't go there: keep the place exclusive... :-)"
2,1815,"Nov 9 2009 	Greenwich Hotel Nirvana in NYC	My wife's birthday was soon approaching and I was looking for something special and unforgettable that we could enjoy. I did some research and found that the Greenwich hotel style was attractive and the spa looked right up my wife's alley. So I booked a one bedroom corner fireplace suite for a Friday night getaway.We arrived by car service from Long Island, and I must admit the hotel entrance is difficult to locate, but privacy is a perk of this location. Once in the lobby you are enveloped in a sensory tease of what is to come. Aroma hinting of peony's, colors and textures that warm your heart. We were welcomed by Hallelujah who was staffing the front desk. He asked for my name and then asked me if I was ready. I asked ready for what, he said we were upgraded, REALLY upgraded. He then lead us for a quick tour of the lobby and drawing room and to the elevators for a lift to the 6th floor. We were rewarded with an upgrade to the most unbelievable suite I have ever laid my eyes on, the Greenwich Suite, a two bedroom, two floored masterpiece with 30 foot windows and fireplace. We were speechless and on the verge of giddy as Hallelujah lead us on the grand tour. He explained the lighting system ( yes, all the lighting is networked) and the fact that we had entrances on both the 6th and 7th floors. Once the formal tour was over he left us to marvel at this suite. Every place your eyes stopped was an ocular delight. The old growth wood floors, the gray aged ceiling joists and panels, the majestic wall of windows overlooking the city, awesome. The dining table was reclaimed wood, and felt inviting to the touch. Placed on the table was fresh fruit, grapes, pears, apples and pomegranate that looked like it was in a still life portrait, my wife had to check to see if they were real. Propped on the fruit was a hand written note from the General Manager welcoming us to the Greenwich. There was a full kitchen ( like someone would cook here) and a fully stocked fridge that was gratis. There was a selection of beer, wine and liquor on hand along with a full ice maker. The bedroom was inviting, and warm. Doors opened to overlook the courtyard, which must be incredible in the late spring or early fall. The beds were by Duxiana. I have heard the commercials for Dux beds on Newsradio 880 for years and have always wanted to try them. Unfortunately, they were not for us. A little too firm for my tastes. The bathrooms were a marble paradise with a huge soaking tub and a walk in shower with a rain shower head. The robes were soft and towels plentiful. The toiletries were by Red Flower and were full sized (nice touch) and smelled incredible. You have to love the energy drink powder, yumm...zoom!After an evening out on the town, we retired to bed and in the A.M. ordered room service breakfast. The sausage was yummy and the eggs were good enough to comment about, the were organic from an upstate farm. We had appointments at the spa, Shibui for 11 A.M. two 50 minute relaxation Swedish treatments. We were greeted by our therapists who proceeded kneed, rub and stretch us to a slumbery bliss. Let me take a minute to talk about the spa and pool. Wow, unbelievable. It was very warm in the pool area, with plenty of seating and lounge chairs. The spa locker rooms had steam showers that you did not want to leave. After the spa, our overnight was coming to a close. We stopped by the drawing room for coffee and were surprised to see that Mel Gibson chose to do the same at the table next to us. A cool way to close out a very cool overnight!"
3,1815,"Nov 8 2009 	A very nice change from the other hotels in the city...	My girl and I have a tradition that we've started, which is to take a Friday night once every month or every other month and stay in a hotel in the city. Even though we both live here in our own nice apartments, it's nice to stay in a new place and have a romantic night in. The Greenwich Hotel was the place we picked for November 2009.So far we've stayed at the Standard Hotel twice and the Gramercy Park Hotel once, and both have been fantastic experiences. This time we opted for something different, and thanks to Tablethotels.com, where I am a Tablet Plus member, we found this charming hotel. I had been to the restaurant, Locanda Verde, before, but I had never been inside the hotel. I'm glad we checked in.i called the day of check-in to confirm my reservation and was told that we were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite from the Greenwich Deluxe room whicih we had originally booked for $695. When I arrived, I found out that the upgrade was no longer available because they had run out of room. I explained this to the desk clerk and how I had been told I was already upgraded and that they had not mentioned that it was &quot;subject to availability.&quot; Well, instead of telling me that I was wrong, the desk clerk did some creative thinking and gave me the double upgrade to the corner suite, which was amazing.The entire decor of the hotel is very European and reminds me of my time in London at the Mandarin Oriental. The bathroom is huge and marbled, and there are some very cool things like glass doors that swing open for the shower and the toilet, which are located in little compartments side by side. There is a large sunken tub that is wonderful for romantic evenings in, as well. And the bathroom amenities were full-size, like the SLS in Beverly Hills, where I stayed a few months ago for business.The bed was very comfortable, and this room had a nice corner view of Greenwich and N. Moore. The room was decorated as if you had lived there for a decade, and everything was tasteful and of high quality. The old has an old, homey feel, and it doesn't feel like a hotel, which we both loved.All of the munchies at the minibar were free, as were the non-alcoholic drinks--a very nice change. At check-in, we were given a nice bottle of cabernet and two fresh-baked cookies, along with two letters welcoming us (actually, a letter and a card), and a $50 spa voucher. (Some of these were benefits from being a Tablet Plus member.)Even though our room was on the fourth floor, it was nice and quiet, and we had a romantic evening and then slept soundly the next morning.Because of the Tablet Plus status, we actually had a guaranteed 4 p.m. late checkout, but we ended up checking out by 2 p.m. Sad, too--I would have loved to have stayed. There was a pool (rare in Manhattan), but we didn't have a chance to use it.One more thing...we had dinner downstairs at Locanda Verde. The food is superb, and it has the feel of a neighborhood joint combined with something hipper. The food is amazing--try the ricotta cheese appetizer, the blue crab crostini, the pumpkin agnolotti, the mama's ravioli, and the lamb meatball sliders."
4,1815,"Nov 2 2009 	Unique NYC hotel	This is a fantastic hotel if you'd like to try something different to the classic NYC Manhattan hotel experience but still enjoy your 5* luxury. We were on a trip for my birthday and stayed in a Corner Suite which was much better than it looks in the pictures and not noisey at all (fourth floor). The room was very beautiful with a dining table, wet bar and sofas and had the feel of an Italian Villa more than a hotel room in NYC. Everything has already been said about the massive bathroom, luxury full size organic toiletries, wonderful ambiance of public rooms and great food in the restaurant. We found the staff very friendly and polite and even got a personal letter from the General Manager sent to our home thanking us for our comments on our experience at the hotel. If you do any research at all into the background of the building of this hotel and Robert De Niro's personal input into the decor and fittings you will appreciate the effort that has gone into all aspects of this unique hotel. We had a wonderful time and will definately be back. Highly recommended!"
5,1815,"Nov 1 2009 	Better Places to Spend This Kind of Money	Service is good, location excellent, vibe is mellow.Noise from the hallway is unacceptably loud (you can hear an entire conversation at ordinary levels through a closed door, which is all of about 10 feet from your bed, meaning it wakes you up). Also, the shades are sheer, so you can read in your room by 630am, with the lights off. Even if/when they fix these issues, it's a lot of money for not all that much - ordinary-sized room, ok furnishings, fine bathrooms, definitely not a place to remember and return to."
6,1815,"Oct 29 2009 	Very good but with reservations	Stayed here to try it out as previously stayed at Soho House (fav), Mercer (2nd fav) and The Bowery (least fav of the three).My wife and I love design hotels, and The Greenwich lived up to expectations in terms of decor in most cases - in general really well done and good atmosphere all round. Borderline 'Swiss chalet' in some areas, but overall a good, warm design. We stayed in a deluxe Greenwich, and a few weird fittings in the room didn't seem to go very well (chandelier for one), but this was offset by the size, bathrooms and overall feel.Staff were friendly and helpful in many cases - but there's certainly room for improvement - at the front desk in particular - and the speed of service in the communal areas could certainly be improved.The spa is as good as it looks in the pictures, although the spa treatments seemed totally over the top price-wise - even for a hotel at this level. It's about double of similar places so I gave it a miss although I would have liked to try.The Italian restaurant (which also served breakfast) was also good - although the breakfast itself was very lacking in terms of any kind of self service items (juice, cereals etc). By lacking i mean non-existent, with menu ordering only.The courtyard's lovely.There were a few negatives, and they would make me think twice about staying again.Noise: The room was very noisy - we could hear another room like the occupants were in ours. May have been through the air vents or something. Unfortunately for us, the guests in that room were [--] all through the night and were [--] movie loud.Several attempts to address this at front desk and get moved were pretty much dismissed and ignored. They said they were full, but to pay this money and not get any sleep is ridiculous - am sure they had higher spec rooms and should have moved us. Not good.Perhaps that wouldn't have been quite so bad if the garbage truck didn't stop by outside our room at about 4:30-5am every morning for an hour, crushing rubbish. We had a room on the North Moore side, 4th floor, and I was woken up every morning - after an already reduced sleep. Not good again.The best part of the room was the free basket of snacks and all soft drinks and water being free - not only that but they're topped up each day! A very nice touch.Having checked my bill, it looks like they charged the posting of a letter I gave them at checkout to my credit card - 0.64p. Nothing technically wrong with that - but seems a bit petty and has never happened anywhere I've stayed before.I've never stayed Tribeca before, and thought it was a nice change from Soho and Meatpacking, although in general we always walked into Soho as there's not too much to do around the area (although there is a great breakfast at Bubby's just round the corner)All-in-all a good experience, but certainly wasn't made to feel special which is always what the end judgement comes down to. Why do these hotels insist on not having the front of house sorted out, and a bit more willing to please? Simple things like that are always the easiest to fix, and make the biggest difference to a guest."
7,1815,"Sep 14 2009 	Noisy noisy noisy	Stayed here on a business trip. Am used to city sounds but the noises from the restaurants were awful. Kept us up all night. Though the courtyard is beautiful, why ruin the scene with a lat nigh restaurant where most of the dinners are not even staying in the hotel."
8,1815,"Sep 9 2009 	Expensive! But amazing service... wram and wonderful.	Stayed here out of necessity (our hotel booking through a web service at another hotel was not honoured, and all else was booked), and paid well above what we planned, but...It was beautiful, the staff were attentive, professional, yet casual and friendly. The room was comfortable, stylish, large, warm. &quot;Free&quot; treats, great toiletries, fab bathroom/shower.And a spa in the basement!Restaurants were A-1.A great stay."
9,1815,"Sep 8 2009 	Tasteful but pricey	The Greenwich Hotel is probably the most tastefully decorated hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed at over 100 hotels in the last 5 years. However, it also the second most expensive...I stayed at the Greenwich despite the hotel being out of my price range because it was the only available hotel on Manhattan during Labour weekend 2009. The hotel has a very pleasant lobby and bar, a cosy courtyard and a well equipped gym and spa, which I unfortunately just had a brief look at. It is located in a residential and quiet part of Greenwich, but there is no shortage of restaurants and cafes nearby.My room had lovely wooden floors, a very comfortable bed, electric curtains, excellent sound proofing, excellent AC system and a beautiful bathroom. Add to free non alcoholic drinks and snacks and I felt right at home.My only complaint would be the free wifi, which was much too slow and hampered my work. Dont stay here if you need fast internet. For a romantic getaway, this hotel is perfect."
10,1815,"Jul 23 2009 	Quite simply the best place in NYC	My girlfriend and I stayed at the Greenwich Hotel for 3 nights and we did not want to leave. I wish we had booked a longer stay. We found our room to be extremely comfortable, peaceful and quiet. The windows kept out street noise and the heating/cooling system operated perfectly and with absolutely no noise. The public areas, such as the drawing room and the courtyard are awesome. They are comfortable and inviting while at the same time providing an elegance wherein you appreciate you're enjoying something special. We enjoyed glasses of wine in the drawing room and some wonderful meals in the courtyard. Often we had these rooms to ourselves. We also enjoyed the beautifully designed and very peaceful pool area. Every time we used the pool we were the only ones there.I have already encouraged many friends to try this hotel and it's restaurant, Locanda Verde. The food at Locanda Verde is fantastic. If you're looking for a romantic and/or relaxing place to get away, I couldn't encourage you more strongly to try this hotel. The staff is generally young, very nice and accomodating.We also enjoyed staying in TriBeCa. It's clean, safe and a bit slower paced. It's easy to get everywhere else in the city, including shopping in SoHo. It has some of the best restaurants all within an easy walk along beautiful city streets. We'll be back soon."
11,1815,"Jul 8 2009 	A wonderful magical place!	My wife and I stayed at The Greenwich last week, we needed a local vacation during some repair work on our apartment. Our stay was amazing, the staff is way above par, the cleanliness and atmosphere also were outstanding. We picked the hotel because we loved the interiors we had seen before. The rooms are super comfy, the bed was like home. You also have to see and enjoy the pool, a true wonder in NYC, not to mention the amazing music and atmosphere in the lobby lounge area, we enjoyed a few drinks there and will be back! Overall, it was a great, quiet and relaxing place to stay."
12,1815,"Jun 19 2009	Greenwich Hotel: Best In New York!	Just returned from two nights at the Greenwich Hotel wich is located in TriBeca. The place, opened last year by Rober De Niro, is positively the best place to stay in the city. Casual yet elegant with a young, very friendly staff that excelled at making my wife and I feel welcome. We had been delayed by the airline and had a 7:00 pm play to catch (the reason for the trip) and the staff helped rush us to our room after a quick check-in and had a cab waiting on us to quickly move us uptown to make the play just in time. The room featured a king bed with french doors that overlooked a pretty courtyard and was kitted out with very unusual items and a complimentary mini-bar. A large basket of snacks, ranging from chips to more exotic treats, was in a large wire basket, again no charge. The common rooms feature cool, very comfortable chairs and couches and a wood-burning fireplace adjacent to the open courtyard. The area was quiet, but there were many great restaurants within walking distance. The hotel restaurant had only recently changed hands and the Italian food was over the top. We dined there 2 nights in a row, something unheard of in a city with so many choices. Wake up call at 6 am the day of departure included the typical phone call, but also a knock on our door with a pot of hot coffee. Truly a wonderful over-all experience."
13,1815,"Jun 1 2009 	Excellent hotel - we'll get back	Our first stay at this hotel - 4 nigths. Extremely friendly staff. The restaurant Laconda Verde is absolutely recommendable, lots of guests, good service and excellent food. Gym is really OK - we didn't try the Spa but it looks great. Complimentary Internet and non-alcoholic bar (plenty). The hotel is a bit pricy but value-for-money is top. Our room was beautiful (stayed at Superior Greenwich Room). We go to NYC once a year and this will also be our hotel next time. Johansen from Denmark."
14,1815,"May 30 2009 	Loved it..	Stayed three nights at The Greenwich Hotel and as the title suggests, we loved it. It's obviously a matter of personal taste, but we love the way they have decorated the hotel and the calm atmosphere that pervades. We stayed in a Deluxe Greenwich room which was lovely and very spacious by New York standards. We also took a look at a Corner Suite, which was beautiful and bigger than some friend's flats... and very expensive. Back in December '08 we stayed at the Gramercy Park Hotel for a few nights and the visit before that we were at the Mercer. The Greenwich is our clear favorite, the other two were good, but the staff at the Gramercy were a little too cool for school and the Mercer is excellent, but feels a little cramped. If we weren't so addicted to trying new hotels, this would be the one to make us stick and not twist."
15,1815,"May 4 2009 	A sophisticated escape	My husband and I chose this new hotel for a much-needed one-night getaway. The first room they brought us to smelled like smoke, which I noticed and mentioned immediately. The staff were gracious and admitted the problem (saying they &quot;can't police their guests&quot; and moved us to a nicer room even though they were &quot;fully committed.&quot; The room was spacious with a king size bed, desk, armchair, a settee and other table. The bathroom was done in a unique spanish tile, and was very large with a dual-head shower. The bed was outrageously comfortable. We enjoyed the included (won't call them free for this price) snacks and bevs. We had massages at the spa which were excellent and given by the top guy there. The pool is warm and lovely. Our only complaints were an intermittent high-pitched whining sound, perhaps the elevator, and the fact that our breakfast did not arrive at the requested time and required two phone calls to resolve. Oh--and the wifi requires a password which they do not include in their printed guide--why not? All in all, a good stay and I wish we could afford to stay longer!"
16,1815,"Jan 3 2009 	Charming hotel	I am a Tribeca resident, and I needed extra space for the Christmas holiday for my family so I selected The Greenwich Hotel. I was very pleased! The hotel exemplifies understated elegance. From the moment you walk into the hotel it feels as if you've escaped from the hectic city. The rooms are a bit pricey, but I felt it was certainly worth it. Each room is individually decorated....a bit eclectic and minimalist, but everything in the room is high quality. The mattresses are Duxiana, and the toiletries were generous portions of Red Flower products (one of my favorites). There was even a wonderful complimentary snack basket in the room with treats such as Twizzlers, Tates Cookies, mints, etc. The public sitting area is beautiful and the restaurant Ago is a great meeting spot. Overall I think it is a great find and a nice change from the more traditional luxury hotels in NYC."
17,1815,"Nov 20 2008 	Highly recommended	I stayed in this Tribeca hotel for five nights and will return. My room was lovely with hardwood floors, high ceiling and a large opening window. The amenities were great; the bed comfortable and firm without being rock hard. The staff were excellent; the doormen prompt and friendly, the desk staff attentive and helpful. It has the most beautiful gym I have ever used in my life and the equipment is excellent. Although the website doesn't say (nor do the staff when you call): there is a Japanese style pool as well (about 85F), so be sure to bring a bathing suit. It is quiet with surprisingly little street noise (much less than at the Ganzevoort or the Library Hotels), and the interior door helps keep noise out from the hallways (although they are very quiet in any event). The location is great. It took only a few minutes to walk to Soho, and it is just a couple of blocks off the Hudson River. The riverfront park directly west of the hotel is being restored and is completely torn up right now; however, if you go just a block or two south it is a lovely walk for miles. I felt very safe walking Greenwich Street at night and it was nice to know that the staff would have noticed if I hadn't made it back in the evening. There is a courtyard and lounge for guests only and they are a very nice respite from the city streets without having to hole up in your hotel room. One thing I found annoying were the numerous business meetings the hotel conducted in the lounge. Whenever a meeting was ongoing (every evening), it felt more like I was sitting in a conference room than relaxing in a guest-only lounge. The restaurant was nothing to write home about. The service and ambience were great, but the menu was uninspired and the execution unimpressive. My meal tasted exclusively of salt. Thalassa (a Greek restaurant just a few blocks away) is a much better choice."
18,1815,"Nov 18 2008 	Very nice	I recently stayed for 2 nights and was very happy with all aspects of the hotel. The room was eclectic and interesting, like all of the decor in the hotel, and had great sheets, towels, products (Red Flower), etc. I like the gratis mini-bar and snacks (not including alcohol) and free wi-fi. Good pool. Best of all was the service which was so pleasant and helpful. I'd stay there again in a second."
19,1815,"Nov 12 2008 	Dissapointing	We stayed at the Greenwich hotel for two nights in October and were overall very dissapointed. The room was big and the bed very confortable, but it was very cold and impersonal. The desk staff were nice, but we felt like we were the only ones staying at the hotel. There were also VERY annoying sounds all night long. There was something depressing about the place. We much preferred the Mercer..."
20,1815,"Nov 11 2008 	Truly badly conceived and executed.	I am still surprised that I spent 766.00 per night in such an uninspiring hotel and such a small room which was not starkly furnished, was just bleak.Lighting is such a problem they put it as a specific multiple choice on the comment card.The pool was closed for &quot;cleaning' during my stay.The staff is very good, but that can't make up for the really poorly executed project which I found artless and almost depressing.These people do not get it."
21,1815,"Jun 13 2008 	Wonderful stay in Tribeca	We spent one night here on a quick getaway and we were very pleased. The hotel feels European and everything was taken care of. THe room was beautifully appointed with a comfortable bed, high count sheets and a tiny balcony that looked over a courtyard. The bathroom was stunning and luxurious. The mini bar was gratis except for the liquor. They have a beautiful pool and large fitness area. Both are surrounded by the construction (the hotel just opened) but accessible to guests. The only disapppointment was the restaurant Ago which was in a lovely lofy space, but the food was barely adequate. Although the complementary continental breakfast was delicious."
1,1823,Nov 24 2009 	Expensive 	Really expensive but the rooms were immaculate and beautiful. I was in town and my niece came over to the hotel room after I was done doing sales calls for my clients and she even commented on how beautiful the room was. Expensive but the company spotted the bill anyway this time. I don't know if i would ever be willing to spend that kind if money on my own but it was a beautiful and exceptional gorgeous hotel. Location was nice but parking was not the best of situations. Train station nearby and tons of taxis though so that might make it easier on someone without a car. I unfortunately needed a car and parking was just murder.
2,1823,"Nov 12 2009 	great hotel but.....	The staff were friendly, rooms were clean and bathrooms without problems. Location was amazing. However, after staying in different hotels in New York, New Jersey, Toronto, Montreal and Qubec we were shocked to discover a charge for the internet! The price for the room was well above what we have payed for other hotels of the same star ratings. When considering the price for the room its disgusting that a charge of $20 per day is added for internet use. Plus there was no available pool. Well over priced for what we recieved."
3,1823,"Oct 5 2009	Wow what a hotel	When I visited this Hotel for the first time, I was surprized to see it. Such a big Hotel!!! I live this Hoel and then the room service and everything is really superb. Must stay in this Hotel once if you make a plan to NY."
4,1823,Jul 7 2009 	great trip	The hotel was nice. And a great choice we enjoyed or stay extremely.
5,1823,Jul 5 2009 	Weekend getaway	Overall a great experience. Rooms are adequate and very clean for New York. The on property restaurants were very good although nothing available for a meal between 3:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. The Hotel is very well situated for a 5 minute walk to Time Square or Central Park. It also is very close to the key subway entrances. Excercise room was massive for a hotel with everything you need away from home. Excellent concierge service.
6,1823,Jun 6 2009 	Great suites	We stayed at the Hotel for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The 2 bedroom suite was spacious and easily have accomodated 6 adults. The service was excellent all round and facilities on the club floor good. One drawback was that swimming pool was missing. They even had comp passes to some of the nearby gentlemen's clubs.
7,1823,"Feb 2 2009 	Don't Confuse The Hilton Club with the Hilton	Prior reviews lead me to believe that some travelers are confusing The Hilton Club with The Hilton. Yes, they are at the same address, but The Hilton Club is a hotel-within-a-hotel as well as a timeshare-type property and consists of suites located on the 37th and 38th floor with their own private check-in desk (and other services). You bypass the ground floor big front desk and ride dedicated elevators directly to the 37th floor. Hence The Hilton Club provides small hotel personal service in the context of a large hotel in a super central Manhattan location. I first stayed here years ago and liked it, but I always hunt up a luxury-bargain and The Hilton Club had not been turning up with favorable rates until a recent prepaid offer for $215 for 2. Not the best deal in mid-town you say? Check again; the rate included complimentary breakfast, complimentary wireless access, complimentary daily cocktail reception, plus gym and business center. The smallest room, the &quot;euro-king&quot; is neither huge nor cramped feeling; it's rather ship-like in that it makes really good use of the space, with lovely built in furnishings. The bed was terrific, a small table and chairs was okay for working, but not comfortable for sitting to watch TV. The large glass-walled shower had a rainfall head and also side jets with excellent water pressure. The stall was spacious and had a seat in the back. Aveda amenities and plenty of shelves complete the nice, if a little compact, but shipshape bathroom. The welcome desk always had two friendly attendants. The breakfast offerings were very nice and well presented; fresh fruits, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, cereals, super selection of baked goods, coffee, expresso, teas, juices, etc. Can't say what was offered at cocktail hour. All in all a very satisfying choice of lodging. A couple of caveats when you are hotel-shopping; be sure you are comparing apples to apples--what are the extra charges? If you shop for a rate and enter 2 adults, 0 children, when a list of options appear, be sure the &quot;second person&quot; is included. With Hilton and some other hotels, it may not be and when you proceed to booking there will be an &quot;extra person charge.&quot; Be aware of what you are getting and what you are paying for in every case. At hotels.com, the extra person fee for this Hilton Club was $30/night; through Hilton directly it worked out to $17/night. If you need luggage storage here after check-out, be prepared to pay $3.50 per bag per 24 hours, plus tips."
8,1823,"Jan 1 2009 	Awesome Stay!	My friend and I stayed at the Hilton Club this past May and we had an awesome time! We arrived very early and although we weren't able to check in right away, they offered us use of their gym to freshen up after an 8 hour overnight bus ride. When we went back a second time to check in they bumped us up to a better room so that we wouldn't have to wait any longer. Our room was newly decorated and we definitely felt like we were getting our money's worth! This hotel is in the perfect location if you are planning on staying in midtown. It's steps away from Rockefeller Center and minutes away from times square. It gives you a great experience without having to stay right in the middle of the business that is times square. Booking our stay was very simple and the Hilton had the best rate we could find considering the location. We booked our trip 4 days before we arrived in the city, but the staff was very quick to help us over the phone. This was my third time visiting NYC, but it was definitely the best trip so far, and our stay at the Hilton had a lot to do with it."
9,1823,"Nov 17 2008 	Mixed Feelings about the Hilton Club	This is kind of a mixed review since our stay started off really badly but ended well. It left me with conflicting feelings about our stay.My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Club for four days. We had just flown in from Europe and arrived at the Hotel around `1am and were very tired. We had pre-payed the entire stay and reserved a King non-smoking about 5 months in advance.When we got there we were informed that Hilton does not hold the actual room request, just the room itself. What a shock! We assumed because we reserved and paid for a King room that we would get that, but apparently the policy is written otherwise. Instead We were given a queen room for the night with an extremely noisy plumbing problem that kept us up. We were promised a King room the next night-- but that just meant we had to pack our stuff and move again.To Hilton's credit they were very cordial and offered us a free dinner. Also when I requested a room on the Executive floor they accommodated for all the trouble they had put us through.The location was very good though...walking distance to Rockefeller Plaza, Radio City Hall, Broadway shows and Times Square.All in all, for the price I expected more but they did make up for it since the executive floor should have cost us $100 more per night but they did not charge us.I would probably stay there again if the price were right and I had to."
10,1823,Jul 1 2009 	Muy bien especialmente la ubicacin
1,1835,Clean room friendly helpful staff	We recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The rooms were clean and well maintained but quite small. As we were out and about most of the time and only there to sleep for 2 nights it wasn't a problem.The staff were friendly and very helpful. We had a few queries and they were very attentive and helped us sort everything out.The location was good. It was in a quiet location but within easy walking distance to Midtown.I would definately stay at this hotel again.
2,1835,"Nov 24 2009 	Great value -- will definitely stay again	This hotel was a quick 2-block walk from Penn Station, and an easy mile walk to Times Square. It was clean, the room was plenty big given that it's New York City, and the staff were helpful (and checked our bags for us the entire day after we checked out). We're writing this review in response to others we read on TripAdvisor before our stay -- people seemed to complain about the speed and availability of elevators in the hotel. They must have fixed that, because we never waited -- ever. I can't believe you can still get such a great value in NYC!!"
3,1835,"Nov 24 2009 	Good Hotel Great Location	Stayed here for 4 nights with teenage son, brilliant.5 mins walk to Empire State Building.Food in bar is fab, huge portions. Ideal.Good idea to book NY limos from the airport saves waiting, driver in arrival area.Rooms are OK, 2 large double beds, ask for a high level flooe with Empire view"
4,1835,"Nov 14 2009 	Good hotel - good location	We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of November. The hotel is in a good location - 10 mins walk from Penn Station and Macy's and just a little bit further and you are in Times Square. The hotel has all amenities you would need when staying on a short trip - rooms are good, comfortable and clean. Our room was on the 8th floor at the front of the building. Bathroom was kept very clean and had a good hot shower. There was room enough for your clothes and a good flat screen TV which had loads of channels - which sometimes can be lacking in the cheaper hotels. We had stayed in California in the summer and this was a big problem. In terms of location you are never far away from everything, shopping, subway, buses, sights etc etc. Would recommend the hotel - but it may not be for someone who wants more amenities on site - it is a room and that's it. Would agree with a previous comment about the lifts - only 2 for the whole building and we did have to wait 15 mins for a lift on the day we were leaving as one was not working - so imagine it could be a problem."
5,1835,"Oct 17 2009 	Excellent if looking for a place to sleep	3 men in same room wasnt the best idea, but we needed just a clean, safe place to sleep 3 nights in NYC. We were in 2nd floor without any troubles or noise.Great location in the middle of Manhattan. Lovely and caretaking service."
6,1835,Oct 13 2009	The staff were very helpful and polite	The hotel was fine so we decided to stay the first night for our dinner. We had a steak for 2 with veg and 2 bottles of local beer. I was amazed at the cost. They charged $115. Some other members of the party had breakfast and was charged $48 for coffee and toast for 2.
7,1835,Oct 10 2009 	Seeing NCY	Great room! Great price. Parking was a problem. Staff very nice. Great Location
8,1835,"Oct 5 2009 	I won't be rushing back to say here.	This hotel, like many of the newer &quot;budget&quot; hotels, must have been designed by a cost accountant who edited an architect's designs with a scalpel. Start with the elevators. Two elevators to serve 25 floors and not even a service elevator?!? Are you kidding me? Everybody gets to wait - including the cleaning staff - because the cost accountant put no value on the convenience of the guests.As for the rooms, they could not get a millimeter smaller in size. Because if they could have, they would have, and the floors would have had an extra room on them as a result!Just getting into the bathroom and closing the door is an exercise in contortions. You won't feel pampered when staying in this hotel, that's for sure.Unlike others, I did not find the double beds to be comfortable. They felt like the cheapest ones that the cost accountant could find.I did find the staff to be both friendly and helpful. The location is pretty good, too: Away from the hubbub of Times Square but still within a fairly easy walk of it. Close to Union Square and the West Village. Chelsea, where the hotel is found, is a pleasant neighborhood as well."
9,1835,"Oct 3 2009 	Great location Great Hotel	We stayed here for my Mother 80th Birthday in Sept 2008.The hotel is located in an area known as the &quot;Garment District&quot;. This is a great location as the Metro is just around the corner, you are close to diners, delis, and there is a pharmacy just around the corner.The staff in the hotel were really helpful and enthusiastic - even when it ewas busy!!we had rooms on a high floor and the views were super. September - Octobr are good months in NY as the temperatures are dropping and the city is busy with business. Best advice - buy some comfy trainers and just walk your legs off!!"
10,1835,"Sep 19 2009 	Very clean and quiet good location.	The room and the bathroom were little but very clean and comfortable. Good location, easy and quick to go either up-town and down-town Manhattan: 3 metro's stations nearby and walkable distance to the Empire, Flatiron, 5th Avenue. Quiet district but not so many restaurants and/or pub nearyby."
11,1835,"Sep 18 2009 	incredible views truly the city that never sleeps!	This hotel is in a fantastic location minutes from macy's, empire state building, madison square garden etc, perfect for exploring. The view from the room was truly breathtaking, looking out towards the empire state and chrysler buildings, however there were no curtains provided, so the room didn't get very dark and it was difficult to get much sleep! The room was an ok size and was clean and comfortable, however despite our trip being at the end of the summer, it was still rather expensive, particularly as we didn't get any meals. Overall, pricey but worth it!"
12,1835,"Sep 15 2009 	Great Stay	My friend and I visited New York City last week. We stayed at this hotel and it was a pleasant stay. Check in was quick and the staff were very helpful. We ate in the resturant three times and food was very good. This hotel is in a very good location. We walked to several areas almost every day. It was very clean. The staff was very helpful in getting us a car to the airport on day to leave. Check out was smooth. Highly recommend this hotel. Rooms are small, but we were only in them for a short time."
13,1835,"Sep 12 2009 	A little gem in the heart of the city	Following an accumulation of Airmiles and Priority Club points (and Platinum Status) I had planned a &quot;free&quot; trip to NYC from the UK. Having stayed before I knew roughly where I wanted to stay around my main highlight a trip to the new Yankee Stadium. The choice was between this and Crowne Plaza Times Square having stayed at the CP before. With this being a new hotel the decision was on the basis of this and the fact the internet was free (and unlike other reviews speed was adequate).Arrived at JFK so took the LIRR to Penn Station and made the short walk down 7th to the Hotel. Arrived at 1pm but was offered my room immediately - even though this was a freebie - 1901 a King Bed with a &quot;view&quot; of the Empire State Building. At the end of the stay I was also offered a late check out - excellent service and status reccognition by the hotel.Having stayed in New York before I expect small room unless you pay the earth. The room here was of a perfect size. In a hotel I want a bed , a desk, TV and bathroom. All of these were provided and excellent. Must say this is the first hotel I have stayed in that provided a HD Tv that actually had HD channels (in fact almost a full cable line up of SD and HD channels). No complaints about he bathroom - good shower a a toilet and basin. Nothing more but what else did I want to do in there ?The local area provides a good mix of shops (CVS, Wholefoods, Duanne Read, Best Buy) and places to each (from Subway, Starbucks and Macdonald to good restaurants) all with a few blocks. The subway was close by along with key bus routes - but did walk to Empire State, Rockafella Centre, Times Square and Union Square all within 20 to 30 mins.Overall a wonderfull hotel and goes straight to the top of my personal list of manhattan hotels"
14,1835,"Sep 12 2009 	Great hotel keep it in perspective!	We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights towards the end of August and we have to say we were very impressed overall. Prior to arrival we were in touch with the hotel about having some parcels delivered before we arrived, the manager took charge of the requests and kept us and his very attentive staff informed so they were there when we arrived.Lets get this in perspective, this is a hotel on Manhattan island, right in the middle of things and therefore space was always going to be limited. When you compare it with the hotels at four times the price you may have a case for saying the rooms are small, but realistically, for the location, price and the amount of time you will spend in them they are just fine. I will say its likely to be the bathroom that has caused most of the 'small room comments' as it is on the small side, but again its perfectly usable.Our room wasn't ready as we were there early (around 1pm) but we were able to leave our bags and set off stright away, advised to come back around 3pm when they expected the room to be ready for us. The room we had was an 'upgrade' from the standard room we would normally get for our rate, we had a 19th floor Empire State building view room which, whilst the same size room (all rooms are similar at this property, there are no suites etc, just standard rooms (seems to becoming more common with franchised IGH properties)) was better due to the open air feeling and the lack of brick wall outside the window.The room was good, sure it wasn't huge, but like central London hotels, size costs money and realistically when you can get this hotel for $100 a night if you are smart about booking it really can't be beaten. The elevators have caused people to comment, sure sometimes there are long queues, but this seemed to only be when they had large parties checking in or out of the hotel, other than that we really didn't have any issues during our stay.The internet was free, a great bonus considering some IHG locations charge up to $20 an hour for access in Europe, it wasn't the fastest thing on the planet but it was fast enoguh for our needs and greatly helped us to be sure we filled our days as best as possible. There are free PC's n the business center in the basement too, when you can print off tickets etc for free - excellent facilities overall in this department.We didn't eat breakfast or any food in the hotel during our stay for many different reasons. The hotel food wasn't cheap, the breakfast wasn't cheap and it wasn't in the nicest of locations. The doors into the Bar/Restaurant are very 'office like' and the layout of the facilities aren't inviting. The bar itself is 'lit' poorly with battery powered LED lights too dim for the size of the room. The cafe desperately needs to have tables and chairs outside, for some reason during our stay these were piled up outside and unusuable - maybe they were packed away for the winter, although with temperatures around 83/85 on our stay they could have been useful.Over all though, Peter (the hotel manager) and his team have a good little hotel here which we wouldn't hesitate from staying in again, nothing was too much trouble and it was great value overall. Highly Recommended."
15,1835,"Sep 8 2009 	Great deal!	We booked 2 rooms: 1 king bed room and a 2 double beds room for 2 nights and we were very pleased! (especially considering the low price we paid). Staff was professional, rooms were beautiful, clean and bigger than I expected. Max occupancy for the 2 double beds room was 3 persons according to the hotel but we could easily have been 4. The max occupancy was 3 because one side of one bed touches the wall so one of the bed would be more difficult to access for one person but it would not have been much of an problem if we had been 4 persons. Rooms were very well isolated too, we didn't hear anything from the other rooms.The only bad surprise we got is that there were no safe to keep our valuable stuff (passports) in the room. But they can keep it &quot;safe&quot; for you at the front desk (but we did not use this service).When we check-out, they kept out luggage so we could leave NY later in the day.There is plenty of cheap parking around the hotel (http://www.bestparking.com). I think we got a better deal using the bestparking website that if we had used the hotel's parking &quot;deal&quot; and our parking was a 30 second walk from the hotel."
16,1835,"Aug 29 2009 	Great stay at great price	My husband and I stayed 4 nights at the Holiday Inn for our anniversary and were very pleased with the discounted rate they were able to give us over the phone. The staff was VERY friendly, and although the rooms were small they had been updated recently and were clean. The linens were nice, the bed was a little firm, and they even gave a variety of different pillow types to choose from. It is located on more of a &quot;side street&quot;, but the F train was very close (maybe 3 or 4 blocks?), and we were able to walk to the Empire State building. I felt very fortunate to have found such a nice hotel for such a low rate in NYC."
17,1835,"Aug 26 2009 	Do not come here	I am Priority Club Platinum member (highest possible level) and I often use Holiday Inns and Intercontinental hotels. I have been to many, but have never seen such a SMALL rooms. If you are traveling with someone, there is barely enough room to stand together by the bed or in the bathroom. Did I mention that rooms are extra-small? Then imagine bathrooms... even SMALLER. The locations of the hotel is OK, on the 26th Street West, I would say that this is the main positive thing, I would also praise friendliness of employees; another problem is housekeeping, which is one of the most slow services everywhere... We stayed here for 5 days, but on three the housekeeping managed to come after 4pm. You have also free access to &quot;high&quot; speed internet, but this is no HIGH speed internet, but extremely slow speed internet. I have even meausured the speeds, and the speed is between 8Kb and 20Kb per second, depending of the time of the day. SLOW. Another thing is that there are no glass-glasses in the rooms, only plastic ones. The hotels only has 2 elevators, so at times you can wait for one for minutes... The hotel actually feels more like motel, not a real hotel. And for Priority Club Platinum members... there are no upgrades. I even asked manager about this, and got the answer that we were upgraded in the high floor (19th out of 25)... not breakfast/dinner upgrade or larger room upgrade... strange... one ask himself about Priority Club membership..."
18,1835,"Aug 22 2009 	Beware of the parking fee...	Our overnight stay here was flawless, from the smiling and attentive service we received at check-in to the friendly bellman who gladly whisked our bags to a holding room at checkout so we could spend a day at MoMa. Only thing that left a bad taste in our mouth was the extra FULL day of parking we were charged for going about 90 minutes over 24 hours at the parking lot down the street. Hotel says the charge is $30 a night, we were charged $60. Turns out it is a flat rate that the hotel has negotiated with the lot, so the hourly rate does not kick in after the first 24 hours expires. So beware. Otherwise, couldn't have asked for a better experience. Request a high floor on the back of the hotel and you'll have a postcard view (Empire State Building, Chrysler, GE Building). Rooms were decent size, neat and clean, beds extra comfy, almost never a wait at the elevators, place was exceptionally quiet, convenient to just about everywhere (subway is a couple of block walk) and the constantly hustling staff couldn't have been more cheerful. They did steer me to a wine shop two blocks away that had been closed for hours, but that was their only misstep. FYI, I did find a nice little wine shop, the Buzz, on 27th west of Sixth Ave. that stays open until midnight."
19,1835,"Aug 22 2009	Decent Hotel. Central Location. Friendly Staff. Dingy Backstreet	Decent hotel, not fancy but clean and comfortable. Friendly hotel staff. Not a long walk to the subway. Room and bathroom compact but two double/queen beds more than adequate for good night's rest. Self parking was $30/car or $40/van at a park lot a block from the hotel. Alternatively free street parking was available at nearby streets (e.g. 27th) from 6pm to 8am.Although hotel itself is nice it is on a small dingy street wedged between two old dilapidated buildings so the first impression of the area is not great."
20,1835,"Aug 22 2009 	Great value find	Got a cheap rate online at the last minute for about 119 USD. Was a steal. The hotel must have the friendliest staff I have seen in a hotel for a long time, the place is clean and well serviced with a business centre and small gym. I liked the philly cheese steak in the restaurant as well. Good location. At the doorstep of the happenings of Chelsea. Would stay there again definitely."
21,1835,"Aug 8 2009 	Great staff clean room central location rooms a bit too small	This was our first trip to NYC. We drove in to Manhattan and this hotel was only about five mintues from the Lincoln tunnel. We parked in the Central Park about a block down the street. The parking is usually $50+ but the hotel will validate your card when you leave and it knocks the rate down to $30 a day. The Hotel was very clean and had all of the amenities that I needed. The staff was very helpful and attentive. The elevator and hallways are not air conditioned so expect to sweat a little bit during peak hours espically if you are staying on the top floors. The room was very clean and had an awesome view of lower Manhattan. However, The only compaint I have is that they rooms are very tiny and I mean very, very tiny. Maybe this is the way everything is in NYC. All and all we didn't spend much time in the room so the size factor wasn't a big issue. I would recommend this hotel to a friend just because it is convient and seemed to very central to all of the sites and lower district."
22,1835,"Aug 4 2009	Great Alternative to Manhattan Midtown Hotels	My son and I stayed here in August 2009. We were traveling to NYC via bus from Washington D.C. and chose the hotel based on location and price. A quick aside, Vamoose Bus is a great way to travel between the two cities. The trip takes about four and one half hours. In most cases its faster than the airlines (door to door). For $25 (one way) you can't beat it.If you're familiar with Manhattan, the hotel is located below midtown in the Fashion District. It's on 26th between 6th and 7th. Not the greatest area, but certainly not unsafe.The one way walking distance to Times Square is approximately one mile and may eliminate the hotel for consideration for some.The hotel itself is new. It is a slender, 25 story building, maybe six rooms per floor. We had a double room that was spacious by Manhattan standards. They were double beds instead of twins. The room had a closet, desk, flat panel TV, free internet (wired/wireless), about 350 sq ft. The bathroom was adequate with only a shower stall, not a bathtub/shower combo.Check in was quick and effortless. The few contacts I had with staff were friendly and helpful. The room was quiet and spotless. The beds were comfortable. Absolutely no complaints. The checkout was also hassle free as they deliver the statement during your final night. You sign and leave it at the front desk with the card keys as you exit.The hotel has a restaurant on the premises which we did not visit.If your business or leisure don't require you to be in the Midtown Area, this is a great alternative. This is particularly true if you enjoy walking. I might think twice about staying here in inclement weather if I was planning on walking to my destinations in Midtown or farther.This is an even better deal if you are able to score a great rate as I did from the Holiday Inn website."
23,1835,"Jul 26 2009 	Not the best Location	Not the best location it would take 20-30 mins to walk to Times Sq and didn't feel as safe as other hotel locations. Room was nice and clean and modern with starbucks coffee and usual toiletries, very nice linen. Staff helpful. Gym very basic, limited equipment and no pool. Pretty quiet compared to other hotels. Didn't try the breakfast as this was expensive but there is a fantastic little grocery store around the corner that did a hot bacon and egg sandwich with free coffee really cheap - highly recommended, very tasty!"
24,1835,"Jul 23 2009 	WOW	This is a great hotel. The staff is the nicest staff I have gotten to experience in years. The rooms are very clean and modern. The rooms are on the small side, but what can you expect for NYC. They do not air condition the hallways and are very hot, but air works great in our room. Hallway noise was very minimal, but we stayed on an end. The pop machines located on different floors seemed to always be out of stock at least the two different dates we went to get one. The hotel is one of the shorter buildings around so not much of a view and being we stayed on the second floor on the back all we got was a dirty alley view and a brick wall. There is only two elevators that move rather slow so be prepared to wait to go up or down. If you decide to take the staircase they lead to an alley with dumpsters so don't recommend taking stairs at night. There was always a taxi waiting outside the hotel so this was great. Pen station and times square just blocks away. An $8 cab fare and you are in china town. Overall great location and great hotel!"
25,1835,"Jul 8 2009 	Outstanding!	My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Holiday Inn, Manhattan recently. We were so pleased with our choice of hotel. Not only was the price great, but the location was perfect - very evenly placed between many great sites. The hotel staff was outstanding. In particular, the front desk staff and chef were friendly, helpful and went out of their way to make our stay easy and enjoyable. Thanks to one of the front desk clerks who pointed us in the direction of a great roof-top bar nearby. In addition to the great staff, the hotel was clean, modern and well kept. We had read reviews that indicated that the rooms were small, but we felt ours was a pretty typical size for NYC. We would highly recommend this hotel and we will definately return if we decide to travel to NYC again."
26,1835,"Jul 2 2009 	Clean and Courteous - GREAT!!!	I travel to NYC often for business and it is next to impossible to find a hotel that you can afford to stay at, is clean and where you are not embarrassed to house clients. Finally, I found one! Location is great - two blocks from the subway and reasonable walking distance from the train station. The price was right - look online for advance sale bargains or call the hotel sales team directly - they were so helpful and accommodating. The hotel is clean and bright with comfortable beds and pillows. The staff was polite, which is rare in NYC and the evening manager even called up to my room to make sure everything was to my liking. I will be staying here as often as possible when I return to NYC"
27,1835,"Jun 15 2009 	Cant get Better	All I can say is the staff was the best, it was a young staff, very professional very helpful. The day I was checking out my flight didnt leave till 7pm and I wanted to sight see and the stafff held on to my luggage till them so I wouldnt have to get another night check in just for the luggage. It is a little noisy but I loved it because thats what I was in NY for. I took the Q33 bus to Jackson Heights train station and from there to F train to 23rd street and 6th ave. It was just a 5 min walk to the hotel. The taxie was 60.00 from La Guardia so we took the train. The room was sparkling clean, pillows and bedding was nice, room is kinda small so if you expect to put someone to sleep on the floor dont even try it. To eat there is a place to eat in every corner. Madison square gardens, Penn Station ,Empire State Building, are about a 5 minute walk to hotel, also Times Square . If you want great location, great service, clean rooms, comfortable beds without stretching your budget, this is the place. But caution if you are trying to get a room with no noise, this in in the central of everything and its noisy and veryyyyyyyy busy buth thats why I love NY :)A+++++++++++"
28,1835,"Jun 9 2009 	Excellent hotel and staff excellent value	We were very pleased with the cleanliness of the hotel, the friendliness and the helpfulness of the staff, and pleased with the hotel's location. We were just three blocks from the subway and just about 10 blocks from the Empire State Building. The rooms are small, but most of our time was spent site-seeing so that was not a big issue. The bedding was very comfortable and there was plenty of closet, drawer and counter space. I would definitely stay at this location again!"
29,1835,"Jun 6 2009	Enjoyed our stay!	Planning just a drive through the city, we decided to stay. Wasn't sure if we were going to be able to get a room with such short notice on a Saturday afternoon. We were thrilled that the Holiday Inn had a room. It is a small room, as others have stated, but it served our needs well. The beds were comfortable, and the room was very clean. We had a wonderful meal at the Prime Cafe located within the buiding off of the lobby, It was the best burger I've had in a long time, with wonderful service from our waiter Joe. We have also received a coupon of $20 to go toward our breakfast. We also were able to park one block down, for just $30/24hr."
30,1835,"Jun 6 2009 	Nice Hotel Great Location and Great Value for money	Got a great deal at this hotel on travel zoo,three of us stayed here for 6 nights in one room with two double beds. Rooms were nicely decorated, clean however very cramped for three people, however as we were out all of the time it didn't really matter. Our room was not serviced on one of the days and we also had a problem with the toilet however when I called reception it was dealt with straight away. Staff were very pleasant and helpful special recommendation goes to Leo on Concierge who was extremley helpful and polite. Hotel bar and restaurant was also very nice, although didn't eat there the food looked superb however the hotel needs to market the restaurant a little more. We ate in an Italian ( I think) across the street and it was excellent. Would stay here again."
31,1835,"May 23 2009 	BEST VALUE AROUND	I HAVE REAL PROBLEMS WITH HOTEL ROOMS BUT CAN'T AFFORD THE 5 STAR ESTABLISHMENTS. These rooms are small but very clean and who stays in the room anyway? I was thrilled with the cleanliness and lack of odor. This is a small hotel with only 9 rooms per floor. Everyone is close to the elevator and you can hear people in the hallway and doors closing. Just turn on the fan in the bathroom and partially close the door to get rid of the light. Ta Da instant sound machine!The staff was always friendly and accomodating to my requests.Located between 6th and 7th, near subways,and a great walk to midtown. I was a lone female traveling and never felt unsafe although I did not walk past 9:00 p.m. and took a cab instead.YES, STAY STAY STAY!"
32,1835,"May 20 2009 	Very good location OK service	It was a nice to stay n this place, It had everything I needed, specially the location I was looking for. I could rest most of the time and had a cozy time!"
33,1835,"May 13 2009 	Perfect staff and location	The staff was outgoing and friendly with an obvious desire to please. Our room had a wonderful view of the city. Bathroom a bit small, but no surprise for NY hotels. The hotel was sparkling clean, well appointed and suited perfectly for a weekend getaway to the city. The mid-town location was perfect since we were going both up and downtown. Easy to get to a variety of subway stops, restaurants and galleries."
34,1835,"May 11 2009 	Reservation was not honored	We had reserved rooms with double beds to accomodate our family. When we arrived, the hotel claimed it was overbooked and could only provide us a king bed for half of our stay. Four in a bed is too cozy for me--family or not! The rooms are very small--no room to even put someone on the floor. It appears this is not an uncommon practice for this hotel. Beware!Rooms were clean. Location was close to Times Square and Penn Station. Elevators were very slow and crowded. Staff was cordial, but unable to fix our uncomfortable situation."
35,1835,"May 4 2009 	Cozy (small) but good location 	Small room but very good for solo traveller. Everything worked (hot shower with good pressure, HD Cable with HBO, adequate elevators, subways &amp; deli nearby).Downside - noisy but effective A/C (usual Holiday Inn wall unit with in-room thermostat), noisy street early a.m. out front."
36,1835,"May 4 2009 	Good Location - nice hotel	Stayed with a large group here over 4 nights.Great location to see everything, and a few minutes walk away from some good eateries. Great Italian around the corner.Rooms were comfortable, clean and as expected. Staff were polite."
37,1835,May 2 2009 	AMAZING STAFF - VERY CLEAN-	Customer Service Was Wonderful I Stayed for a week and had no complaints - the rooms were a little crammed I felt for the the price but they did have an in house restaraunt (kind of expensive) the location is perfect right in the heart of the city: downtown Manhattan
38,1835,"Apr 28 2009 	Good location nice staff noisy rooms poor shower	The building is very narrow. There are about ten rooms per floor, so the minute people get off the elevator, you can hear every single word they're saying. On the plus side, most of the room are corner rooms, so you'll encounter little foot traffic. I had no trouble sleeping.My room had a very poorly designed shower (no tub). There was only a plastic strip on the floor, and the shower curtain was too short. As a result, water went all over the bathroom floor.On the plus side....very friendly staff and a convenient location. I didn't dine at their restaurant, so I can't comment. There are decent options nearby. On the corner of 26th St and 7th Ave there's a Mexican grill and also a Whole Foods a block to the left. If you turn right towards Madison Square Garden, there are plenty of places to eat. It's a 15 minute walk to Herald Square and Macy's. The hotel is between two subway stations, and it's a short ride to Times Square and the West Village."
39,1835,"Apr 20 2009 	Really small but convenient and very nice!	We decided to stay one night in New York in order to see Time Square and Broadway before we continue our journey to Canada to visit my husband's family. This hotel is located in Manhatten's 6th avenue on the 26th street. So, if you want to go to Time Square (42nd street), it is around a 15-20 minutes walk. But the street (7th Avenue street) is very busy and full of things happening left and right. The number of people walking towards and coming from Time Square can be over whelming! You can't help but think where are all those people coming from or going to!The hotel itself is clean, quite small. You enter from the hotel door and surprise, the reception is right 3 staps away! The receptionists are funny and loud. The guy who was checking our reservation was throwing jokes and made us feel quite at home! The room had a big very comfy bed, big 36 inch LCD TV (which looked huge compared to the size of the room - so you feel like you are in a cinema!). the bathroom was clean but there was no bath-tub. Just a stand up shower which is alright. There was free wireless internet connection as well.We asked for a wake up call and a taxi the next day at 6 am and everything was right on time.The only draw back I found was the noise. There was a couple right next to our room who came back around 4 am clearly drunk and by the time they managed to open their room I was awake because the noise was as if they were with us in the same room.Ah, one more thing: apparently you could actually order your own food from any restaurant outside the hotel. Seemed it was permitted as when we were going out that night, the room next to us had some pizza carton outside their room."
40,1835,"Apr 18 2009 	Cozy Hotel	We stayed at the Holiday Inn last weekend. The front desk staff is wonderful. The beds are very comfy. The rooms are small but that is typical for Manhattan. We had to unpack and put the suitcase in the closet or we would have had to walk over the suitcase. Two of our rooms had only shower..no tub but we did not miss a tub. It was a little noisy in the a.m. But the hotel can't control noise. Other travelers would be talking by the elevators and the elevators are slow,,, also common in older NY buildings. Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Parking is down the street and I think it is about $35.00 per night.I booked the hotel on the internet for holiday inn and somehow ended up booking an extra room and they will not refund it...so be careful. It worked out as my son and his girlfriend came and stayed with us and it was fun."
41,1835,"Apr 18 2009 	Great locationa and very good VFM but rooms small	Excellent location, ideal for shopping, restaurants, Times Sq etc. Stayed 2 nights in a twin bed room and got a great rate of $140 a night. Hotel is new, modern and clean. The big issue, mentioned by others, is the room size. We were 2 adults and a teenager and it was a squeeze. The room is mainly 2 beds! But they're v comfortable, with a choice of firm and soft pillows. A large LG TV, a small wardrobe, a 3 draw dresser and a tiny desk filled the rest of the space. The bathroom was 'compact'. But everything worked and in reality how much time do you spend in your room when in NY? The AC was loud, but we didn't need to use it at this time of the year. Free internet was a bonus. Would definitely recommend, if you get a good deal."
42,1835,"Apr 18 2009 	Best value clean gret location but small rooms!!	Great hotel close to subway stations, restaurants and Empire state building. Small rooms but clean and comfortable (amazing bed!). You don't hear anything from the next rooms or even outside.restaurant in lobby but also great breakfast places (malibu diner) close by."
43,1835,"Apr 16 2009 	Clean and New	The Holiday Inn is a great choice if you are looking for a clean and new place to stay. The hotel is very nice and the employees are great. Ask for a high floor room to have some great views. I would give this hotel 5 stars if the rooms were not so small. If you are staying more than a few nights this might not be the hotel for you if you value space. However, for a few nights it is perfect especially if you value a super clean and new hotel. I would have no problem staying here again for a few days."
44,1835,"Apr 16 2009 	Great place for sleeping.	Room was clean, but very small. If you just want a clean safe room to sleep in it is OK. Not a lot of things close by."
45,1835,"Apr 4 2009 	A Tall Secret on 26th St.	The Holiday Inn on 26th St. is so new that some cab driver did not even know it existed until we gave them directions to the hotel. It's a tall and slender hotel surprisingly in a quiet street between Chelsea and the Flatiron District.  As many travelers have commented on past reviews the lobby and rooms are small. However, there is a bar and restaurant that provides a larger space to socialize away from busy crowds in the lobby. I was amazed by the friendly service the front desk provided even with people crowding at the desk wanting to check in, check out, ask for directions, and complain. The employees are able to handle such stress and maintain a friendly smile throughout the craziness.  We stayed on the 16th floor wtih a view of 26th street. The double beds were really comfortable, but as other travelers stated, the rooms were fairly small. The bathroom itself had a tiny sink, but four people were able to manage a weekend in this tiny room without any issue. I did not hear any noise coming from the hallway since some of the doors to the rooms are tucked in small hallways. As far as the elvator situation, we really had no issue waiting between the two in the building. It ran up and down quite fast so there was no issue having to wait for a long time. This elevator is in comparison to The Pod, which unfortunately ran slow and was smaller. We had drinks at the bar and the people there are so friendly and will make you some strong drinks. However, it was pricey like all other bars in NYC.  The neighborhood is really interesting since it is mixed with tourist, straight, and gay people around. On 7th street lies FIT and Martha Stewart's studio and on 6th street lies your CVS and Starbucks. The subway are on 28th and 23rd street, but would reccomend 23rd street since its busier around the Flatiron Building and provides multiple tracks (RWFV). Cheap breakfast can be found at A Taste of NYC on 23rd and 6th (literally eggs,sausage, and hash brown for under $4). After hours dinner and good dessert is on 23rd at Malibu Diner. There is a bar next door to the hotel, but there is also Rogue around the corner. This bar felt like the employees were snobby so we didn't go there again.  If this is the new look for Holiday Inn, then I definately agree they have stepped up to a level of competition with Hilton, Sheraton, and Radisson. This hotel was very comfortable even with small rooms, the bed was amazing. Its ambience and exceptional customer service made the place bigger than it really was for a weekend stay in NYC. The neighborhood is far enough from the crowds of Time Square, but close enough to see the lights on the corner of 7th and 26th. I definately would stay here again since the neighborhood offers all nearby attractions without the noise and crowds of NYC. Holiday Inn is a tall secret on 26th street that will make a memorable stay in Chelsea, NYC."
46,1835,"Mar 2 2009 	Met Our Expectations and More!	The reviews that we read about the hotel were realistic and well written. We were plenty surprised by the cleanliness and service-oriented staff. Yes, the room was a little small, but it was actually cozier than small. We found the location very convenient to all the attractions that we were interested in. It is a short taxi ride to Times Square or a good, brisk walk up 7th Avenue to Madison Square Garden, Times Square, or the restaurants and services in Chelsea. We definitely would stay there again."
47,1835,"Mar 2 2009 	Great location and helpful staff	Check-in: Very smooth and uneventful. The front desk was really helpful during our long weekend. One gentleman recommended the Malibu Diner for breakfast and we ended up eating there 2 mornings in a row because of the quick service, low prices and we loved the French Toast and Club sandwiches there. When we checked out on Sunday, the staff at the front desk offered to hold our bags for us so we could do some more exploring before catching our bus. They also graciously allowed us to sleep in a bit on Sunday before checking out which is ALWAYS appreciated.I read reviews that the elevator wait time was long but we never had a problem with this. Even if we had, we were on vacation so it wouldnt have ruffled our feathers too much. The room was very small as you would expect from previous reviews, but since we werent expecting anything different, we werent disappointed. The bed was definitely a plus with a really comfortable king mattress. Only thing I wished is that I had requested a better view since we just had a view of a building right next to us. No biggie since we werent in there much, but if you pay full price, it may be something to request since they sometimes can accommodate you. Another somewhat annoying thing that I dont normally notice, was how much you could hear the neighbors. We could hear our neighbor slip the key into their lock next door and it was so audible that I couldnt shake the reflex of jumping up and thinking the maid was coming in. I dont think theres much you can do about this since the building it so tall and narrow, the rooms are really tightly packed together. The location was great for us since there were plenty of quaint places to eat within walking distance. I was like a kid in a candy store, just exploring and picking a restaurant based on the displayed menu or the look of the place. We walked everywhere. We liked being able to walk to Times Square and doing lots of shopping at the big Macys. I recommend walking to the Chelsea Piers for lunch one day because they have fresh seafood in their mall and the most amazing bakeries Ive ever seen. Gourmet hot chocolate was excellent at a coffee stand in there. For Central Park, the Met, Little Italy, etc, you will probably need a taxi like we did, especially if it's cold."
48,1835,"Mar 1 2009 	Fine but small	Recently stayed at this hotel which is relatively new, its OK but;The upside, free internet access, only 10 minute walk to Penn Station, so easy access for the train to Jamaica for the JFK airtrain or for the train to Newark, so no expensive taxi ride needed.Down side, very small rooms, no comfy chair and the bathroom entrance is off the room which is all right if you want to sit on the toilet and watch TV in the room. It has a tiny work desk and very small closet, everything is very cramped up. The worst thing of all, no video check out, so if you want to leave at a busy time a long wait at the front desk would be involved and the lobby is also very small.This hotel is fine for a short stay, if you just want a basic hotel."
49,1835,"Feb 27 2009 	Great location great value	We stayed here for one night. It is in a great location - close to everything. The rooms were nicely decorated, clean, very comfortable bed. The staff were so friendly. Would definitely recommend it is a great hotel in NYC that offers convenience and value for money."
50,1835,"Feb 25 2009 	Perfectly adequate for a short city break	Stayed at this hotel in Feb 09. We had a 3rd floor room with 2 double beds. It was a bit cramped, not much wardrobe space and the bathroom was bijou, but it was clean and the beds were comfortable. And how much time do you spend in the hotel anyway with a same sex friend?! Air conditioning was a bit noisy but we turned the thermo down a bit which solved the problem. Didn't try the breakfast because the local options like Murray's Bagels were really good. Hotel was well located, pretty central and within easy reach of major attractions and good eating places."
51,1835,"Feb 24 2009 	The place to stay in NYC	I booked this ages ago using my Priority Club points for a surprise Valentines break to New York for me and my girlfriend.A lot of people dont seem to like booking hotels that are only 15,000 points a night but we've never had any problems anywhere in the world. My only question is.....why is this only 15,000 points a night ?!We arrived after a long flight UK-Amsterdam-JFK and took the subway to Penn Station. Its no more than a 10 minute walk but on the way back we got the subway at 23rd St which is even closer.On arrival we were greeted with a big welcoming smile and check in literally took 2 minutes...if that. Reading other reviews we though we would wait ages for the lift but it wasn't a problem. We were given a room on the 23rd floor as I had emailed saying it was a surprise break and the views were magnificent. Looking over the Mahattan skyline.Ok so the rooms werent the size of a suite from a Hollywood movie but they were immaculately clean with everything you needed...a very comfy bed and a spotlessly clean bathroom with large wet room type shower and all of the soaps, shampoos etc etc. A large flat screen TV allowed us Brits to look on in amusement at the millions of TV channels while we unpacked and there is free interent as well. Wired and wifi.Everytime you walk in through the front door or out of the lift the receptionists always greet you with a friendly hello and a smile. People may think this is 'the American way' but it doesnt happen everywhere in the States I can assure you.Walk out of the hotel, turn left and then left again and you have mini supermarkets and some cracking deli's for that New York feeling of getting bagels with all sorts of hot and cold fillings and a couple of coffees to go.Walk out of the hotel, turn left, cross over the road , up to to the next block and trun left and you are on Broadway and from here it is a 10-15 minute walk and you are in Times Square. This hotel is no more than 15 minutes walk from Times Square, Empire State, Penn Station, Madison Sq Gardens etc.People have said they have to wait for the lifts. One morning we waited about 3 minutes. ANd it probably stopped at most floors on the way down as the maids use the lifts as well. Total...about 5 minutes. Whats 5 minutes out of your life when you are in New York on holiday?The few times we used NY taxis it was no more than $5 to the hotel including tip. This hotel is central and clean and new. The barmaid behind the bar the couple of times we wnet in was annoying in that everyone had to know what she was doing, where she had been and how she was this or did that...but hey...you're in New York. We only popped in as it was happy hour and we were just cominbg back to refresh before we headed back out.At the end of the day, this is an ideally situated hotel in the centre of town that is clean...spotlessly clean...and has the same size bed as any other hotel. The same size wash basin, the same size toilet, the same size coffee mugs and the same size window. The maids make no noise. The views are spectacular and rather than spend $55 on a yellow cab from JFK, spend $5 on the Air Train to Jamaica central and then $2 on the blue E line to either Penn Station or 23rd St and walk 2 blocks.When we go back to NY, this is where we are staying !"
52,1835,"Feb 21 2009 	best hotel and friendliest i've stayed in new york !	myself and a friend just got back from new york and stayed here loved the hotel and the staff were just so friendly and couldn't do enough for us . we,re due to go back soon and wouldn't stay anywhere else had fantastic time !!!"
53,1835,"Feb 13 2009 	Excellent Value!	Great location. Nice cozy room. Tastefully decorated. Large thick bath towels. There were 4 of us (2 couples) in a room with 2 double beds. It was a bit cramped but we didn't spend much time in the room anyway so it suited us just fine.The staff was amazing. The most courteous, friendly staff I've ever encountered in NYC. And extremely responsive. When we had plumbing problems, someone was at our door within 5 minutes to take care of it."
54,1835,"Jan 20 2009 	A no-problem stay; good budget option	Got a great $95 rate on Priceline for a holiday weekend in NYC. This hotel has only been open 7 months, so not everyone knows about it. Location is good--it's halfway between the F/V (6th and 23rd) and 1 (7th and 28th) subway stops, although the 1 is slightly closer. There are convenience stores, drugstores and restaurants just steps away: CVS and Duane Reade on 6th, Chipotle and BRGR on 7th. I recommend Supermac on 7th just south of 29th: multiple varieties of macaroni and cheese. Received an &quot;upgrade&quot; on arrival to a king bed on 14. Small, NY style room, and really tiny bathroom (bathroom even tinier than the ones at the Radisson Lexington). But everything was clean and comfortable. Flat-screen TV with many stations, about 1/3 of which didn't come in. FREE INTERNET! (Wired or wireless--I went with wired--but be sure all the ethernet cables are connected properly.) I had no noise problems--I could only hear people if they were in the hall outside my door. It was super cold during my stay, and it was kind of hard to keep the room warm because the cold kept radiating from the window, but it was better the last day when it got up to freezing. Staff was pretty friendly for a NY hotel, greeting all the guests as they got off the elevators (no long elevator waits, either). The bartender even changed a $100 for me. The only problem I had was one day when I left my room at noon, it was not cleaned when I got back. I called down and someone came right up and changed the towels and made the bed. I appreciated that; I've had hotels tell me I was out of luck before when that happened.All in all, I would recommend this place to a single traveler especially--but probably not families due to the size of the rooms. Maybe a couple. I don't know what the two-bedded rooms were like."
55,1835,"Jan 7 2009 	Great Deal in Manhattan	My husband and I got a really great rate ($96.00/night) at this hotel. Granted, we stayed in early January--a downtime for NYC hotels. I had booked in part because of the price and in part because of the reviews read here. Everything was better than I expected. We stayed on the 21st floor and had a nice view. The room appears to have been very recently remodeled/updated. Yes, the room is small, as nearly all Manhattan hotel rooms are. Yes, sometimes we had to wait a few minutes for the elevator but it was much better than I had anticipated after having read other reviews here. The room and the entire hotel were very clean. The staff at the reception desk were incredibly friendly and helpful. They seemed very genuine and appeared to want us to really enjoy our stay. The location is great. IT is a nice, clean, safe, hotel. We got our great rate on their website. I would definitely stay here again."
56,1835,"Jan 4 2009 	Friendly staff	We have just returned from a six day trip to new york and were a bit nervous of some of the comments regarding the staff and the lifts in this hotel. However we were very pleasantly surprised. We arrived on Xmas Day (family of 5 - children aged 15. 15 and 20), were greeted very nicely by reception, and then took the lift up to the 20th floor no bother. The rooms are small admittedly but have everything you need. Only gripe would be that the cleaners congregated outside our room each morning as that was where the trolleys were kept. We could not fault the reception - they went out of their way to be friendly, and the lifts worked reasonably quickly at all times. The position is good - just a few blocks away from Macys and then on up 5th Avenue - what more could you ask for?!"
57,1835,"Dec 24 2008 	Great location and staff	We stayed at this hotel from 18th to 21st December - a surprise birthday trip for my wife.We flew UK - Amsterdam - JFK but unfortunately our luggage didn't. We arrived 3pm on the Thursday; the luggage finally caught up with us at 3am on the Saturday.As soon as they aware of the problem, the staff at the hotel were solicitous and helpful. Within minutes we were sorted out with all the toiletries etc at their disposal, helpful advice and offers of any further support and assistance we needed. They couldn't have been more helpful.The rooms weren't large, but were big enough for our short stay. We had a double for my wife and I and a twin for the kids. The twin had a shower room. The double boasted a bathroom, but the bath was no more than a deep slightly elongated shower tray.But what do you expect in a city where space is at a premium?Everywhere was clean and well maintained. Our one problem - no plug for the bath - was sorted out in minutes.Each room had a huge TV with a vast list of channels, alarm clock, free internet (plug in and wireless), and tea/coffee making facilities (apparently not universal in the US). Not much tea or coffee though - take some of your own or buy additional supplies locally.The bar and restaurant prices were horrendous. We ate breakfast at the Malibu on 23rd Street - five minute walk (in the snow!), great food and inexpensive.The heating/air con in each room was individually adjustable (which I hear is rare). If you go, it isn't enough to change the wall thermostat and set it to &quot;auto&quot; - you also need to change the heat/fan speed settings under the flap on the air con unit itself.The beds were really comfortable. Good supply of pillows and towels.Overall a great hotel for a touring or shopping trip. Not a hotel to kill time in, but all you need in NY is a bed!One last recommendation - if you got to NY for the first time, get a guide to show you round. They know the quickest ways to travel between any two points, and the best places to view the inindividual sites. I would strongly recommend http://www.familyinnewyork.com/ who are competitively priced and work very hard to design your personal tour of choice. Scott (the boss) and Mark couldn't have looked after us better. Try them - you will see a lot more in a day with them than you would in a week on your own. They are also happy to offer unlimited advice on shopping, eating, entertainment etc."
58,1835,"Dec 19 2008 	Would stay here again	Great place to stay if you're looking for a clean room in a very good location. Staff was pleasant and helpful, room was very modern and ammenities are simple, yet functional.Make no mistake about it, there is nothing fancy about this hotel. It's just a great value for NYC and within walking distance to most of lower and mid-town Manhattan."
59,1835,"Dec 11 2008 	Great stay	Just back from New York had a weeks stay here and not dissapointed either, rooms were large two double beds, comfortable and a lovely view of the Empire State Building from the bedroom window.Staff were friendly and helpful.Hotel has normal facilities plus free internet in a buisness room, small gym and bar with restaurant, only downside here the bar do not sale draught products beers only by the glass.The hotel is in a decent location easy to walk to Macy's and a short walk longer to Times Sq, Empire state building, Grand Central station etc. Car rental only 5 mins away too for the adventurous and those looking to travel farther afield.Would i stay here again, yes, would i recommend this hotel, yes"
60,1835,"Dec 10 2008 	Liked the Hotel	I just got back from spending 3 nights in this hotel. I enjoyed my stay, the staff was very friendly and the hotel was clean. The restaurant that's inside has half price drinks 7 days a week for a few hours each night and the food was GREAT! The owner is on hand doing the cooking, the tortilla chips were fresh and the salsa great! Fresh wings, Fresh cut and dipped calamari, it was all outstanding! I didn't have any issues with the elevators or wait time. The rooms are small but having spent time in other hotels, they were the same there. We didn't go to nyc to sit in the room, by the time we came back at night, it was right to bed!"
61,1835,"Dec 10 2008 	Small but very nice...	This new hotel has its ups and downs. The staff was great! Friendly, responsive, and really helpful. The rooms are very small - not much extra space but you wont spend much time in your room in this perfectly located hotel. You are in the middle of everything and there is so much to do! The main downfall is the elevators....there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel and it is hard to find a ride with room on it. Overall, a very nice place."
62,1835,"Dec 9 2008 	Very nice hotel w/ tiny rooms and few amenities	Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Inn. It was a very nice and clean hotel, but for what I paid I feel like there should have been a lot more included. This is not a BAD hotel by any means, I am just used to receiving a lot more amenities for a lot less money (free breakfast, pool, fridge in room, etc.). The Good:- Hotel bar happy hour had half-priced drinks from 4 pm to 7 pm- Room furnishings; very comforrtable bedding - Location; very close to Subway stops and not far from Times SquareThe Bad:- The rooms were tiny! There were only two of us sharing a room and we felt very cramped. I can't imagine staying with more than 2 people in a room. - Elevators; there were only two and a few times it took a long time for them to come- Very few amenities; no pool, tiny &quot;business center&quot; and &quot;execise room&quot;- Hotel website claimed to have a mini-fridge and CD player in the room, but it didn't have either.Overall a nice stay, but in the future I will choose a hotel that offers more."
63,1835,"Nov 30 2008 	Great location... shame about elevators and a bit pricey!	My partner and I chose this hotel because it's located near Penn Station - approximately 10 minutes walk away. We arrived from Boston by train, and walked four blocks downtown along 7th Ave to 26th. The lobby was small but the reception staff were very friendly, efficient and professional. Our room was on the 15th Floor - it's bigger than an average New York hotel room, with two queen-sized beds! These beds were amazingly comfortable! The TV was awesome. It offered 100's of satellite channels - if we didn't have go out and see our friends, I would have been very happy staying in the room for two whole days watching TV! The main problem about this hotel was its lack of elevators. There were only two of them, and both were tiny. Guests had to share them with bell-boys, cleaners and other hotel staff. So, sometimes we had to wait ages for it, especially in the morning. And other times, it was too crowded. We were on vacation, so it was OK - but for those in a hurry (i.e. businessmen), it wouldn't be so great. Secondly, breakfasts were not included in the price, considering we paid US$350 per night. Luckily, there were two McDonald's nearby - one on 6th Ave and the other on 7th Ave (24 hrs). The nearest subway station was two blocks away on 28th. Overall, it's a great hotel in the Flower District. Great location - right in the heart of Manhattan. We will definitely stay there again. And it may sound cliche, but &quot;We love New York!&quot;."
64,1835,"Nov 26 2008	One person's cosy....	...is another person's cramped, or so this hotel's reviews would seem to indicate. We recently stayed there for one night at the start of a holiday and then four nights at the end. The first night we were in room 2507, on the top floor under the air conditioning system! A fabulous view towards the financial district did not wholly compensate for the noise level.Our twin room was, in the American way, funished with two double beds. While this worked in other hotels we stayed at on our trip it meant that, in the small rooms that this hotel possess, it was difficult to open, store and manoeuvre around two farly large suitcases. Our four nights were spent in room 807. There was still a noise problem from both within (an air conditioning duct runs down the inside wall of the '07' rooms) and without. I think that the bedroom windows should have been triple glazed, which would not have added a great deal to the cost of this recently opened hotel.As other reviewers have noted, lifts can be an issue. On our last morning one had broken down, a seemingly not uncommon occurrance, and it took my partner about 20 minutes to get down to the lobby with her case - she only managed that by getting in the lift while it was on the way up!On the plus side the hotel is within walking distance of many major tourist attractions and three subway lines. The rooms were clean and reasonably well appointed. The reception staff were as helpful as they could be given the chaos that sometimes reigns when a coach party are squeezing into the small lobby. I'd stay there again but I would be choosey about the room I'd accept."
65,1835,"Nov 16 2008 	A great hotel	A fantastic view from the room.That sums up the hotel room for me.It also had a fantastic HD Flat screen TV, perfect air con, a comfortable bed and a great location. The 28th Street subway station is a 2 minute walk away, or you can be at MSG (Penn Station) in 5-10 minutes.The hotel room was not massive, but is ample for 2 persons.The room was very clean and although the hotel only had 2 lifts, I never had long to wait. There is a small gym and office with free internet access in the basement.I had a 21st floor room with views toward Empire State Building. Next time I will ask for a South Facing room to look towards Lower Manhattan."
66,1835,Nov 4 2008 	Never stay at this hotel for more than one night	I would never stay at this hotel again- never!There are two main issues that make this hotel inconvenient if you stay for more than one nightThere are only two elevators for the whole hotel- there are 25 floors so expect long long waits. Worse twice in a week one elevator broke down so on the last day we waited 22 minutes to get from the top floor to the lobby. I would have walked but we had luggage to bring down. Standard thru the week was a ten minute wait in the morning.As we had to check out we left our luggage and came back at 3pm to pick it up- again only one elevator was still working and they had moved our luggage to the storage on the 3rd floor. With a lobby full of people waiting for luggage we again waited for more than 20 minutes to get our luggage. Knowing they had problems with the elevators why would you move luggage from the lobby! I asked for a Manager but apparently she was working trying to find luggage for other clients and I could wait no longer. The staff look as if this is a regular thing and are shell shocked. They do their best to apologize but it must be agonizing to have to do this day in day out. The rooms themselves are fine- nothing elaborate but clean. If you are on the 25th floor do not stay in 2501 as it is right below the elevator shaft so you hear the elevator moving all night. I had to move after the first night. There are better hotels in the area- normally I stay at the Hilton Garden Inn on 28th Street but they were booked on the Halloween night.

You can however hear most of what is going on in the corridors outside the room. I recommend you use the room fan at full speed at night, this stops you from hearing any noise outside the room. The internet is stable however can be very slow. You can have to wait for the elevators as there are only two for a hotel with 24 floors with 10 rooms on each floor. All in all its a good little hotel and nicely comfortable."
68,1835,"Oct 29 2008 	Nothing Special	Wanted to stay at the Holiday Inn nearer Little Italy, but it was book. So we were able to use Priority Club points to stay at the 6th Ave. location. Lobby was a hole in the wall and the room was no bigger. You could easily get claustrophobic in a space so small. Priority Club got us a room on the 21st floor, but that only made the wait for the elevator that much longer. Breakfast was miserable and high priced- oatmeal, granola with yogurt, tea and coffee came to $30. Starbucks was a better deal. After 2 days we were advised to have the key card rekeyed, but of course we got all the way up to the room to find that the key card did not work. Not near Times Square and not near Little Italy or WTC area. Really not good for much. Someone said that in a few years the area will be better, but who wants to wait. No service elevator so you have to compete with the bellmen and cleaning staff for the lifts."
69,1835,"Oct 14 2008 	Loved the Holiday Inn Manhattan 6th Ave	This was our first time going to New York City, and we absolutely loved it. The hotel room was small but cozy, It felt like we were at home. The bed was the best I've slept on while being on vacation. The staff was so helpful and the location was great. When I return to New York I'll definitely stay at this hotel again without a doubt. The t-shirts are right when they say...I love New York!!!"
70,1835,"Oct 9 2008 	Loved it. Its great	Extremely professional service. The manager (Juniors ) was extremely helpful and professional. The rooms were a little small, but its a new hotel and we were provided a room on the top most floor( 25 th) . Comfy bed, very very clean room and bathroom."
71,1835,"Oct 9 2008 	Very Happy with this Holiday Inn	I read the reviews and was concerned. Instead the check in area was small but just fine- there were maybe 15 people in the area and we still got right to the front desk and checked in quickly. The front desk staff was professional, courteous, and genuinely wanted to assist with any travel/tourism needs (same at check out). The room had a nice view of downtown. It was smallish, but sufficient with a new mattress- new everything! The bathroom was small and very basic- but this is no Ritz Carlton, and in NYC size will be reduced. The location was sufficient.I nornally don't stay in Holiday Inn hotels (hilton, hyatt...) but I liked my stay and would recommend that anyone consider this hotel."
72,1835,Oct 7 2008	commencement of a long holiday	We stayed here for two nights the commencement of a three week tour.We were very happy with the location and with the hotel as a whole.We enjoyed an evening meal here which was good.
73,1835,"Oct 5 2008 	OK but could be better	Stayed here for two nights at the end of a coach tour. As stated in an earlier review, this hotel does not appear to be able to handle coach tours. The lobby area is very small and can quickly gets filled up with luggage. Only having two lifts causes major problems and major delays. Our tour arrived an hour before check in which seemed to cause chaos with luggage being left on the sidewalk when porterage had been paid. Reception staff were generally OK but could be unhelpful at times. Only a limited number of securty boxes were avalable which is a surprise considering how many rooms there are in the hotel. The room itself was good but small with very limited storage space. The hotel location was very good"
74,1835,"Oct 5 2008 	Wouldn't recommend this one	As with other reviewers I found many delays with the lifts. 25 floors and only 2 lifts doesn't make sense. Add that to a tiny and very crowded reception , and keys that didn't work on two consecutive days mean that this is a hotel to which I won't be returning. The young staff were helpful though , and being on the top floor I had no problems with noise."
75,1835,"Oct 5 2008 	Another good Holiday Inn	We stayed here for two nights at the start of a family holiday. The room was a little small, but hey, this is Manhattan! The hotel itself and the staff were great, very helpful, very slick, good luggage handling/storage etc, and the only wifi of the holiday which accepted my own outgoing mail server. We didn't do breakfast (expensive) but there are lots of diners and restaurants just around any corner. If you just want somewhere comfortable, clean and secure to lay your head, this is as good as any. It pays to watch the website very carefully for prices - we got two nights cheaper than one night the following month."
76,1835,"Oct 2 2008 	Below average hotel	Allow extra time on your holiday to take into account the time you will have to wait for the lift. Everything seemed good until we got to our room and found it was a tiny double. We had booked a twin about 6 weeks previously. Thought it was a mistake so went to reception - they said that they had overbooked on twins (hadn't bothered to tell us) and their manner indicated that it was not their fault and we would have to put up with it. Made a fuss and eventually given a twin room. Room was tiny - nowhere to put two suitcases down and furnished with items way too large for the room - the light took up half the desk. Air conditioning too loud to have on at night. Housekeeping seemed to vary from ok to having tea bags, paper cups and pillows strewn about the room.Couldn't wait to leave."
77,1835,"Oct 1 2008 	OK but housekeeping is hit and miss	The hotel is in a good location, close to very good bars and restaurants in Chelsea. Several subway stops within a couple of blocks.As it's new , everything is new and clean. Good HDTV, free wifi and printers available in the business centre.We didn't have to wait too much for the lifts, however they did break down one day (when we were inside!). We also found the room quiet with no street noise (we were on 23rd floor), and had a great view of the Empire State Building.Rooms are small, but I gather they're about normal for New York!My main issue with this hotel is the housekeeping. One day the towels were not replaced, and it took several calls to get them. Another day coffee cups weren't replaced. Another day bins were emptied but no replacement bin liners put in.Maybe if the staff spent less time joking about in the lifts together then these things would not be forgotten??Reception staff were very friendly and helpful though. Overall we were happy, but the room was free (reward points), at $400 a night I may not have been so impressed?"
78,1835,"Sep 24 2008 	You'll need PATIENCE and EAR PLUGS!	Ok, so its one of the newer hotels for IHG in New York, still struggling to find its footing. However, the people that put this hotel together were obviously in a rush to make a buck. There were 2 big issues during our stay, the first being the NOISE and the second being the LIFTS.The noise issue is not only the normal external sounds you associate with New York, such as the rubbish truck that comes calling at 12am, the bottle collectors that come at about 3am and then the tour buses that sit outside the hotel idling from 6am - we would have thought double glazing was a minimum standard here. But the biggest issue is the inside noise of other guests and of the doors closing in neighbouring rooms. There are 10 rooms on a floor, and every time someone opens or closes their room door you will hear it, everytime someone is waiting for a lift (all the time, more on that later) and talking - you will hear it, and everytime the maids start yelling in the corridors you will hear it. So bring ear plugs, you'll need them. It wasn't like we were in the hotel room a lot, but when you are - you will wish you weren't.The other big issue is the lifts. The hotel has 25 floors with roughly 10 tiny rooms on each floor, so you can imagine how long you will wait for a lift to get up and down! A high floor will be good for less noise, but you will sacrafice time waiting for a lift. There also appears to be no staff lift, so often staff will clog the lift's use using it to go up a few floors, the maids getting to their floors in the morning, calling a lift then deciding to take the stairs and so on. Plus if a Porter needs to use it with a trolley, it will take up half of the lift leaving room for only another 3 or 4 people. It really is frustrating. As a result many people resort to having to use the stairs, but you can't get to the lobby level by stairs you have to go to the basement or to the outside fire exit., oh and watch out for all the floor's rubbish that the maids have put in the stairwells as well waiting for collection. The hotel also really struggles to handle groups, as the group all arrives at once, as the lobby is so small there is no where for them to wait, then they all cram into lifts, the lobby is full of luggage, and so on - just not group friendly.Staff didn't really interact as well, generally not friendly or helpful, no apologies for a few things they stuffed up - just no attitude of caring.Overall very disappointing. Won't return. Tiny, tiny rooms - be very aware."
79,1835,"Sep 23 2008 	Close to Penn Station - Great stay friendly staff	Was going to NYC to catch some local bands over 2 nights, so wanted to stay one night vs 3 hr trip home and back...or train to NJ and back. Found the Holiday Inn at 6th Ave had a low rate for reward nights, and positive reviews, so booked it.On arriving Thursday, it was a quick walk from Penn Station to the Holiday Inn, about 6 blocks. The front desk had 3 people working and I was helped right away. Check-in was maybe 2 minutes!The room is on the smaller side, but not too crowded to me. All new furniture, fixtures, flat screen tv. The room was very clean, as was all of the hotel that I saw. I like the location, kind of midway between where I visit in midtown and lower east/west side. If you have a little time and energy, an easy walk to Times Square or midtown. Easy cab ride, or long walk, to lower east side.They do have a business center in the basement, with 2 computers, that you can use for free. Easy to access and check email. Staff was friendly and accomadating. I was also able to leave my bag there thru the day and pick it up before I left Fri night. All at no charge.I'll definately check here again for future trips to NYC!"
80,1835,"Sep 23 2008 	Echo 2travelers	Nice hotel, updated rooms thought small, ours had a decent view of the Empire State. Only two lifts (elevators!) so very busy, could take 10 minutes toget down. Nice staff, quick and efficient check in and out. Quiter area, need to walk to busier areas, but like all NYC safe."
81,1835,"Sep 15 2008 	Holiday Inn is OK for some but maybe not all	We booked two nights (Fri &amp; Sat) for a weekend in NYC. We used a &quot;discount&quot; hotel site and to be honest, even the so-called discounted price seemed a bit steep for a property of this type in this location. The big pluses: hotel is brand new as of June 08 so everything is still fresh and clean. The staff we interacted with were efficient and friendly. Did not eat in the hotel restaurant; can't comment. The building itself is small - only ten rooms per floor! The room we had with one king bed was well appointed with large flat screen TV (hundreds of channels) and a coffee maker. But it was small, with a VERY tiny closet and just a few drawers for clothes. Naturally, since we paid a &quot;discount&quot; we were stuck in a room right by a very loud air intake vent in the hallway - sounded like an airplane engine even with the door closed. We are sound sleepers so it wasn't an issue for us but it might be for many. The bathroom was very small but it was new and clean. Lots of towels. Complimentary items were limited to a bar of soap, small shampoo and small lotion (no shower cap or hair conditioner). The room was just fine for two people for a weekend but it could be an issue for longer periods of time. We were also on one of the first few floors so we used the stairs going down - it was a real time saver. The elevators were very busy and we did hear others complaining about how long it took for them to get to and from their rooms. I would not recommend this hotel for tourists unfamiliar with NYC. The location is not that great unless you are confident using the subway and/or can walk comfortably for several blocks to get to restaurants. The Chelsea area is really nice and is off the beaten track but it doesn't have a lot of touristy things to do. The front desk staff are good at checking people in and out but limited with their advice for what to do in the area and how to get around. Had to interject at one point because they were advising an elderly, somewhat frail-looking foreign couple to take the subway somewhere instead of a cab. The subway was on a goofed up schedule due to track maintenance (very common) and it would have entailed transferring lines. Thankfully they decided to take a cab and I'm sure they arrived at their destination fine. Overall, this is a good location if you are an intrepid traveler, familiar with NYC or staying for a brief visit. Otherwise, you may want to consider another location closer to more familiar sights."
82,1835,"Sep 10 2008 	Great new hotel nice little location - getting over any teething problems	I stayed here for 7 nights on a mixture of business and travel. Overall, I would say it was a good experience.Plus points: I really liked not being up in the hustle and bustle with all the tourist hoards, this is nearer Chelsea and the Garment district. I also found the free business centre a plus and the staff really helpful at all times. Going back to the location, you're close to the Fashion Museum/College so handy for that, there's a CVS down the street, Whole Foods a few blocks and various other stores around. Easily walkable to the Square Garden and 34th St shops like Macys. Negatives: I might have been something to do with the hotel being relatively newly opened but on occasion there were some issues with the lifts being operational (altho only 1 out of action at a time) so sometimes it was painfully slow waiting for the lift. I was on the 22nd floor, so after a long day didn't really fancy the walk!Rooms: I had just the one bed, it was perfectly comfortable, choice of pillows. Flatscreen, two phones, tiny wardrobe and some drawers. Bathroom fairly compact, shower only though which suited me. There are only 10 room rooms on each floor I think and altthough you could hear noise from doors closing I couldn't really hear the people around me. I had a high floor room at the back of the building. Now, I'm not sure where it's an upgraded room type but I had a great view across to the Empire State Building, so it might be worth asking as decent veiws can be hard to come by in NYC hotels. I did have room service, which was adequate and came in good time - but didn't try the restaurant. Overall, I would stay here again as it was in a good location and a budget hotel."
83,1835,"Sep 2 2008 	very modern new hotel with great location	Stayed here for 5 nights. Had a room 1907 which was a corner room with 2 double beds. There was 2 adults and 1 child in the room. THe beds were very comfortable with luxurious bed linen and a choice of soft or hard pillows. It was a regular size for NYC, the two beds in the room, a desk, a small closet with iron and board. You had to clean up after you as it was easy for the room to seem like it was a tip due to the size.There was a flat screen tv, air conditioning which was lovely as the weather outside was in the 90's. Our room looked south and you could see other buildings. However, some of the rooms did overlook the Empire State building. The hotel is 26th st and 6th ave end. It was 5 mins walk to Penn Station and the nearest subway was 7th ave and 28th st. or broadway and 28th st. There were plenty of deli's nearby so dont worry about the lack of mini bar in the room. There were also ice machines and vending machines on 3 separate floors These had soda, water(2usd) and crisps and sweets. There was also an Olive Garden and McDonalds and Starbucks on 6th Ave. All within 5 mins walk. There was also a nice bar called Rogue where you could sit outside on 6th Ave. This had a nice seating area outside. There was also a bar next door to the hotel that looked nice.The bathroom had a small bath with adequate shower and small sink with hairdryer and basic toiletries. The towels were fluffy and replaced when required. The maids need to look at the rear of the bed though as we found a pair of mans underpants (yes a bit disgusting) and a mens deodrant. I wouldnt let this put you off though as obviously the staff are very new in the hotel. The staff were friendly and they stored our bags for us and sourced us a taxi with enthusiasm.The reception staff were very friendly and welcoming and tried very hard to keep you happy.The reception was small but hey alls its for is passing through. There was a bar next to reception with comfy sofas and bar stools. They were friendly and offered us lunch or evening menu on the night we ate there. The evening menu was a bit expensive but normal for a hotel in NYC. It was 8usd for a large glass of wine. The food was good and kids ate free and got a free soda. Next to this area was the restaurant which was part of the bar area. I gather this is where breakfast was served.I used my hubbys priority points for the trip and it was only 15000 a night this is very good for NYC as normally you would need 25000-40000 per night.There were no safes in the room. However, there were free safety deposit boxes at reception. If you lose the key they charge you 350usd.On the basement level there was a small gym area and a business centre. There were 2 computers with free internet. This closed at midnight. There was also free wifi in the hotel room if you had your laptop.Would I stay here again. It would have to be a yes. I would only pay 250 a night max though as i think there is other NYC hotels that have slightly larger rooms,."
84,1835,"Aug 30 2008	Serviceable Hotel with the Basics	Currently staying at this Hotel over Labor day weekend. The hotel front desk staff is very accomodating. The Lobby is very small, the elevators are small, the hallways are small. I can see when they built this hotel from the ground up space saving was a big priority. The hotel was built from the ground up, and finished three months ago. ( June 2008)The rooms are very small, and of course the bathrooms are tiny. The shower has almost no pressure, do to watering saving device. The &quot; SInk&quot; is a Joke. Its the smallest sink I ever saw. Furnishing are nice, bed is good. When you put your clothes in the armoire it is so tiny, you cannot close the door property. There is a very nice flat panel LG TV in the room. Overall the room is in good shape, and very clean. Bed Linens are upgraded, and the carpet in the room is nice. Very Modern, and updated room. The doors are very thin, and you can hear everything going on outside in the hallways. If you are traveling alone, then the space issues are not too bad. A couple will be cramped. Three Forget it! The hotel rooms are very close to each other, so you can hear the opening and closing each time someone comes in or out. There is no closet in the room. Bottom line is that if you can stay here for $200 or under I would take it. Anything over $200 I would look elsewhere. I would rate this a 3.5 star property, only because of the small area in the rooms. The property is well located, and close to train stops."
85,1835,"Aug 26 2008 	Nice but small	I stayed here during the NY Gift Show this season. MUCH better than the Mildew Plaza. The hotel is modern, nicely appointed, and the staff is doing a good job. I took a cab from GCS and the cabbie didn't know where the hotel is. It's half way between 6th &amp; 7th on 26th St. There's an ATM right out the door and to the left (credit union). Plenty of convenience/drug stores around the block (CVS, Duane Reade) should you need them. Normallly on business trips I like to stock up on bottled water, fruit and yogurt at these places and keep the items in the minibar fridge. Well, there is no minibar at this hotel so there went that plan. Reception: Is a tiny desk on the right as you enter. Maybe 2 people can fit behind there. This is a tall skinny hotel. 10 rooms on each floor. Elevators like molasses. Expect to wait 5 min for your ride up or down. Room: I had room 1705 and it was small but nice. Clean, modern. The bed actually had a plastic mattress pad on it for some reason. Hell, I was happy that the hotel is new and there were less chance of bedbugs! (There were none) Matress was comfy. Pillows comfy but small. Wireless internet worked fine and is free. You could even order room service from it. TV was nice and large LCD on the dresser. Small closet with ironing board &amp; iron. Cable box was almost like being home. My one problem was the phone. It didn't work. I went down to reception to report it upon checking in. I was told someone would come fix it while I was out. No one did. I figured the next day it would be fixed while I was at work. Nope! 3 days later I went back down and complained. They sent someone to look at it. After 5 min of checking both extensions repeatedly, he realized it was plugged into the wrong jack somehow. So it finally worked. Bathroom: Tiny! They provided plenty of fluffy towels, a shampoo/conditioner all-in-one, a lotion, and a bar of facial soap. 3 days into my stay a bar of bath soap showed up, but I don't use it as I bring my own bodywash. But found it odd that they waited 3 days to give me bath soap. LOL Was having a mini spat with the maid who kept putting the waste basket on the left of the sink against the wall. As a rightie, I kept wanting to throw stuff out on the right (between sink &amp; toilet) and kept moving it there, she kept moving it back the next day. Oh well. Nice water pressure and temperature in shower/tub. Kinda awkward opening the door with the bath mat down because it is so small in the bathroom. Restaurant &amp; Louge: Both nice. Had breakfast in the restaurant the first morning. Waited quite a while to be served once we ordered and it wasn't early (8:30 am).Food was tasty, though. Prices a little high. Louge was loungy and dark but nice if small. Never got a chance to see the gym. Taxis were waiting outside each morning so that was very convenient and even if they weren't the 1 subway line stops 2 blocks away on 28th and 7th. Convenient, clean, and nice. Recommend."
86,1835,"Aug 21 2008 	Excellent Stay ;o)	Excellent hotel! We stayed 2 nights and from the moment we checked in, could not find anything negative. The location is a great central location, with the subway only a couple of blocks away. The staff was outstanding, very friendly and accommodating. Every staff member we talked to was helpful and very pleasant, not your typical NY attitude. The management has done a great job in ensuring the best customer service atmosphere. I would definitely stay there again."
87,1835,"Aug 17 2008 	Pleasant hotel stay	I stayed here for two nights and was very satisfied, on the whole. The view wasn't great, but the room was clean, air conditioned and nicely furnished, with a huge, fantastically comfortable bed that was so high, it was all i could do to climb into it! I would have loved the flat screen TV, but mine was faulty and only picked up a few of the many channels that should have been available. I phoned the main desk and assistance was given, but the problem was not resolved - (disappointed not to have been offered a refund of some of my money). Also a problem with a blocked toilet - quickly resolved. Liked the coffee maker and complimentary daily newspaper, also availability of ironing board and nearby ice machine. The hotel staff were very welcoming and pleasant and I had a two great, undisturbed nights' sleep. Didn't try the food at the hotel, but the bar area looked nice. A number of decent places to eat very close by."
88,1835,"Aug 17 2008 	Great Experience	We were looking for a convenient hotel, near MSG, and this one fit the bill. I did use Priority Club points for it, but the hotel was well worth paying for! Very clean, small rooms, but the beds were great. High beds, great pillows and bedding and a good night's sleep. Bathroom is small, hard to shut the door while you're in there. The TV didn't work, but I think the cable was out and who's in NYC to watch TV anyway? The valet parking that was mentioned on the booking site was non-existent. Had to drive my car to a garage up the street. I was planning on a valet and there was none. That was the only bummer of the trip. Ate at the on-site restaurant for breakfast, the staff was very attentive and the food was good. The desk clerk was great when we checked in, gave us a map of the subway and advised us how to get to the subway we wanted. He was very pleasant. I highly recommend this hotel."
89,1835,"Aug 8 2008 	Great location!	Great Location... Close to subway, Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Empire State Building....Small rooms, which is typical for NY. We were there for 4 nights. The first room we had was a top floor, corner room, no much room to put suitcases anywhere....1 night at 1 am, the smoke alarm kept going off, called the front desk 3 times over 40 min before someone finally came and put in a new battery!Lost water for over 8 hours in entire hotel......they did take money off for that night w/o our asking. We had noticed on the side of the bed the rug by the wall was damp, was really damp by 2nd night, figured out that the ceiling in the bathroom was leaking....requested to be moved. We had to pack our bags and leave at the front desk, no rooms were ready at the time. Room was ready when we got back from our outings for part of the day. 2nd room was even smaller! Could not open door to room all the way due to luggage......even worse situation for luggage than 1st room. I will say hotel seemed clean, front desk person we dealt with for most of our stay was very nice and helpful....Food at the restaurant was good. Not sure that I'd stay here again tho...got a great rate at the time."
90,1835,"Aug 4 2008 	Perfectly fine nothing fancy	I stayed at the Holiday Inn 6th Avenue for two nights on a business trip to NYC. The hotel is an older building (not brand spanking new as the picture online would indicate), but it has been completely redone. The elevators are very slow, but that was about the worst of it. The rooms are small, but very well kept. Bed was comfortable, and I liked that they offered you a choice of firm or soft pillows in the room. The bathroom was very clean, if small. No bathtub here, but an excellent shower. This was no big deal for me, but I can see that some people might want a tub. The front desk staff were uniformly polite and professional. They held me bags for me for several hours after checkout without any problem, and everything was just as I left it when I returned. There is a restaurant and a bar, but I did not partake of either, so I cannot comment. Room service menu was (as expected) very pricey with limited choices. There are plenty of restaurants and bars within a short walk of the hotel, so I would recommend venturing out a little rather than eating at the hotel. Overall, I enjoyed the stay and would have no problem staying there again."
91,1835,"Jul 29 2008 	Perfect Stay!	Upon arrival in New York, discovered we could not stay in small studio apt. with relative and needed a hotel. We got on internet for possiblities and found this Holiday Inn had a vacancy. What a stroke of luck for us. The accomodations could not have been better. The staff was so friendly and helpful with any request. Our room was perfect, a/c worked wonderfully, service was excellent, and I will only stay at this hotel if and when I return to New York. Highly recommend this hotel to all."
92,1835,"Jul 27 2008 	Highly Recommend the Holiday Inn	We booked this hotel last minute...like right when we landed in NYC and decided to get a hotel rather than crowd my step sister in her studio apt. I googled something close to her and we ended up in this affordable gem...not luxury, but has everything you would want if you like to travel on a budget but have champagne taste. What I liked:Friendly staff; clean room, lobby, and sitting area with small bar for a cocktail when you are exhausted from touring the city; good location with starbucks and train station around the corner; flat screen t.v; comfy pillows; coffee pot in room (bring your own coffee, theirs was kind of yucky or go to starbucks around the corner); Martha Stewart films just one block away; great central location for sightseeing....What else could you ask for? The rooms were small, very small, but for the 220.00 a night rate in Manhattan I was not complaining one bit! I was traveling with my mom for a fun weekend getaway and would definitely stay there again with my husband or with friends."
93,1835,"Jul 17 2008 	comfortable stay in a great location	I recently spent two nights at the Holiday Inn Manhattan. The hotel is a brand new high rise actually located on W. 26th Street near 6th Avenue. Overall we had an excellent experience. The king room was small, but serviceable, with a great bed and nice flat screen TV. The bathroom was tiny, but full equipped. The staff was friendly, and seemed to be anxious to help foreign visitors and NYC first timers.The location is fabulous. Chelsea is close to theaters, has great restaurants, the food market and lovely tree lined streets.Our only problem was the shower curtain that did not reach the base of the shower stall, and water got to the bathroom floor. But that was a minor fault."
94,1835,"Jul 17 2008 	upscale holiday inn	Hotel just recently opened so everything is new and clean. Was upscale from the typical holiday inn. Rooms were very small, I was wondering why a room with two double beds would only accomodate 3 people and I got my answer, you'd be falling over eachother. I'm cutting hotel some slack since it just opened but there were no and I mean no towel racks in the bathroom, no table or chair, or refrigerator (despite the website claiming there is one in every room) the top of the dresser had the tv on it so there was no room there. No closet just a small wardrobe ontop of which the coffee machine was perched (good for Magic Johnson, bad for those under 6'5&quot;). two small elevators so if you're on a high floor build wait time into your trips. I was on second floor so I took stairs on down trips but you can't do that going back up since stairdoors lead outside. Beds were comfortable. Maid service was soso, made beds and left fresh towels, but looked like bathroom wasn't touched (no empty toilet paper replacement or replacement of toiletries/cups). Desk/Restaurant staff was great, restaurant good. Make sure you park in their assigned lot and get a sticker on the parking ticket when you check out, doing that changed our parking fee for 2 days from $101 to $60. Overall a nice hotel, will be really good when they finish everything"
95,1835,Jul 16 2008 	Comfortable with a great location	We (family of 4 with two kids 8 and 6) stayed one night on a leisure trip. Hotel is new and fresh. Location is very good for a nice mix of new york life. Three blocks from two subway lines. 7 blocks from Penn station. A few blocks from Chelsea and some eclectic neighborhoods. Even some interesting restaurants and clubs on same block as hotel. Overall the hotel is new and the staff very helpful and friendly. Rooms are small per other New York rooms we've had but still comfortable. We'd definitely like to stay here again.
96,1835,Jul 15 2008 	Perfect location	New hotel so everything is nice and clean. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. King room was on the small side but not unexpected for NY. The central location was definitely a bonus. It's perfect for tourists and business guests. Anyone needing to be pampered should look elsewhere. Only minus - the elevators can be slow (very minor issue). Would absolutely stay here again!
97,1835,"Jul 15 2008 	Great Stay!	We stayed one night at the Holiday Inn Manhattan 6th Avenue. As with all hotel rooms in NYC they are a bit on the small side, fitting the king bed, a desk and a small bathroom. The suggested occupancy of the rooms should be heeded...do not try and fit a larger group into these modest size rooms. No roll aways available...they wouldn't fit in our king room anyway! That being said it was nicely appointed with comfortable beds and a big flat screen tv. Free wi-fi was a plus.We did not use the workout facility at the hotel, but it had one treadmill, one exercie bike and an elliptical. All brand new. It is located in the basement of the hotel.Only two elevators for the 25 floors so your wait can be long (around 4 minutes). We had no problems waiting though!The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. Always willing to help with any question or request. They are very knowledgeable about area restaurants etc.A convenient location with multiple subway stops within 3 blocks. The neighborhood, Chelsea, felt very safe at all times of the day and night.We would stay again if we were in the area. A good price/value ratio! Overall a great stay!"

1,1841,Absolutely wonderful	This hotel was recently renovated and is beautifully done. It is located on the Upper West Side and is across the street from the Fairway market which is one the greatest grocery stores. The hotel rooms come with complete kitchen. We really enjoyed our stay here.
2,1841,great place to stay if you dont wanna be slap bang in city centre....	stayed at this hotel for two weeks.. and it turned out to be a great location for our holiday.. just up from subway which we used all the time and it was ideal for us.... staff were very helpful and pleasent... even met a fellow thin lizzy fan at reception which was good omen! ha.... lovely views from the hotel room at nite too.... very clean.. quiet.. ( except when some jerk decided to start playing his trumpet at early hours of sunday morning.. i phoned reception but nobody arrived .. small gripe though)... laundry room was bonus... and great wee cafe rite beside hotel.. being so close to central park and john lennons old place was bonus too! if you dont wanna be located in heart of city.. and would welcome quieter area at nite.. i would highly recommend this hotel..
3,1841,"A great hotel that certaintly lived up to expectations	We arrived at Hotel Beacon with a sense of expectation that this would be a hotel that was a cut above the rest and we were not disappointed. We were staying for 8 nights and were lucky enough to be upgraded to a one bedroom suite - roomy and well appointed with all you need. The service was great and we found the staff were professional and helpful with everything we needed including all the little things that make a difference. The upper West Side neighbourhood is wonderful after a hard day pounding the NY pavements with loads of great restaurants within easy walking distance with fabulous delis, supermarket and bottle shop across the street."
4,1841,"Nov 21 2009	Train Across America (First stop)	This hotel was a splendid place to stay. We were lucky enough to have a very comfortable suite. As it was well equipped with fridge,cooker and microwave. Also the most fantastic mega market was just across the street. The fresh fruit displays need to be seen to be believed.The location was very convenient for Central Park and as it is on 77th Street the tube within 3 min walk on 72nd Street took us direct to Time Square.We would certainly stay here again."
5,1841,"Nov 21 2009 	Beacon Hotel well kept secret.	Stayed at Beacon Oct 30 to Nov 3. Second time. Excellent rooms, good size, lovely comfortable beds. Good bathroom shower etc.Staff very pleasant and helpful, unlike some reviews stated. Only gripe was lack of sufficient coffee in room to enable use of coffee maker! Reception staff provided more when asked but i would have expected cleaners to replenish. Small thing i know. Everything else greatSubway a block away, easy access to everywhere. Central Park 5 minutes walk. Amsterdam Avenue, parallel with Broadway, some excellent restaurants. Dined at Nice Matin, really good food. Wine list 20 pages, one bottle listed at $14000. Need i say more.Lively bars, good fun area of NY.Manhattan Diner a block north, wonderful breakfast at really good price. Packed out all day, says it all. The two egg special with ham, potato hash, squeezed juice, toast and as usual gallons of coffee. Perfect. Really enjoyable stay, good base."
6,1841,"Nov 18 2009 	Perfect for us and the kids	My husband and I and our 2 young children (ages 1 and 3) stayed at the Hotel Beacon for 3 nights and were very impressed. We had a 2 room suite with kitchenette. Both rooms were of good size with a door that could be closed between the 2. The staff were very helpful, especially with providing and infant crib and rearranging some furniture in the room. Everything was very well appointed, comfortable, and spotlessly clean, including the kitchenette. Also, the room was very quiet. It was really perfect for us and the kids, especially since the kitchenette 9and the large grocery store across the street) allowed us to have breakfast in our room. And for NYC, the price was reasonable."
7,1841,"Nov 14 2009 	Excellent place to stay	We had stayed at The Beacon a few times before and chose to stay there again on our latest trip in July.(I'm late on posting!)Since the previous time we were there, the rooms have gotten a major overhaul. If you look on the hotel's website, the room they show looked exactly like our room. We had a studio room, which was just the bedroom and bathroom, which was fine. This was the smallest room we've had at this hotel, but it didn't matter. Everything was upgraded, from the bed and linens, to the dishware in the small kitchen area. Probably the best upgrade the hotel did was to the elevators! It was so nice to push the elevator button and actually have an elevator show up shortly, unlike in the past when the wait was interminable. The desk staff was very courteous and helpful. The in-room safe wouldn't lock, and, upon reporting the problem, someone showed up in about 5 minutes and fixed it. So no complaints.As usual, the location is excellent. Just about a block to a subway station that is an express stop, so if you got on the express train you could be downtown very quickly. Fairway Market across the street still amazes me. Lots of restaurant choices nearby. A short walk to a main entrance to Central Park, and just a few blocks from Lincoln Center."
