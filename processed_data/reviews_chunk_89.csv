76,1945,"Nov 8 2008 	Overpriced - even for NTC	Hotel expectations in NYC always need to be quite low. But I have just checked in at the Marcel with front desk staff who behave as though you are spending about a quarter of the actual cost of this place. And then a TINY TINY room with an air-conditioner from the 1970s, a few touches to make it look 'design' or 'boutique' but it doesn't hide the fact that it is not 100% clean, the bathroom suite is old fashioned and ugly and there is not even a wardrobe to store clothes. I would not stay again."
77,1945,"Nov 4 2008 	Clean convenient	This hotel is in a nice location, convenient to the subway and to midtown. It is very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. The room was small but we expect that in NYC and it was not tiny.The shower had only half a door! That was weird. It had what looked like half a sliding door but it did not slide. I called the front desk, assuming it was broken, and was told it was meant to be that way. So when you showered some water always got on the floor. There was no place to put anything in the shower, no shelf for your shampoo or razor.There is a very nice area on the 10th floor where wifi is available. They serve a continental breakfast which we did not buy, but coffee was free. There is an outdoor area too, on the 10th floor, which looked like it would be great when the weather is right.Aside from the shower we were satisfied with the hotel. There are plenty of places to eat that are very close by"
78,1945,"Nov 4 2008 	OK but not for 350$	We went there with my husbant between 23-29October 2008. After reading most of the reviews we requested for a front room overlooking the street rather than a back room. The size was very good and extremely comfortable, design was modern and room was very clean. The only problem with the room was - as one other reviewer mentioned- that the windows are not double glazed and imagine that the hotel is on 3rd avenue. The first 2 days we didn't have a problem as we were knackered from jetlag but after that the noise was too loud to have a decent amount of sleep so we ended up waking up every day at least at 7!!! On the noise issue, the first day we arrived we noticed that there was a connected door in our room which was locked and when you opened it it faced another door locked from inside from the adjoining room. First day the adjoining room was obviously NOT accupied. Second day, we had to wake up in the middle of the night because of laughter and conversation that I thought was taking place in our room - please bear in mind that in this hotel the acoustics are UNBELIEVABLE! You hear everything...even noises from toillet and showers.Also note that there was no room service until late afternoon, so no coffe in the morning if you want to have one in your room (not a big one for me but my husbant wanted an early morning waker so he had to dress and go to a Starbucks further down 3rd avenue).We have checked the 9th floor room with the complimentary coffee and pcs but bear in mind that this is the size of 2 small hotel rooms; pcs were almost always taken; view is truly very nice. Coffee not that great, even if it is complimentary...to be honest I have not tried the complimentary cheese in the afternoons.Staff specially the doormas was very nice - reception people were a bit indifferent, not too much bothered.Overall I would say that it was ok but not for this amount of money and they definitely need to do something about the noise..."
79,1945,"Oct 23 2008 	Fantastic	I loved the Marcel! Although the rooms are rather small, the comfort is fantastic. Especially the bed is great (exactly what you need after long strolling trough the city). And the roof terras on the tenth floor is great. On 6 o'clock there is a wine and cheese reception over there (free!) and it offers free coffee and access to the Internet. The location is very central in NY. I will be back."
80,1945,"Oct 22 2008 	Hesitate	I had a bad experience and woudl hesitate to recommend the hotel. On arrival the air conditioning was on full blast so it was like walking into a fridge. Gave up trying to switch it off and had to get front desk to help. They then told me there was no heating at this time of year even though the room was freezing. Anyway i thought the room would eventually warm up so i let it go. I then noticed the horrendouss noise from outside, after checking the window i found it was broken. I asked for another room and was moved to a room that was so small the door hit the mini bar when i tried to open it. The room was quieter .......because the window was hidden away so it felt like I was in a cupboard. Again the air conditioning was on but in a corner which was so dark I couldn't see the controls. Also, the window opened onto a brick wall. I could not wait to get out of the place. One good point - i tried room service and the food was very good."
81,1945,"Oct 8 2008 	We'll be back!	Our stay at The Marcel couldn't have been better, great location, very clean rooms and above all the staff were wonderful especially Angel the doorman and Michael at the front desk plus the views from the 10th floor breakfast lounge were stunning all this made our first trip to New York a truly memorable experience..........we'll be back!"
82,1945,"Sep 29 2008 	Great location; Great Staff.	This hotel was perfect for me as a &quot;just retired&quot; single woman.I was apprehensive about being alone in New York but the staff could not have been more helpful. Helped in the door with baggage; given a map with directions for walking, subway, everything I needed on arrival at reception (and next day theatre tickets and shuttle to airport arranged for me).Room was indeed small as other reviewers have said, (no-where to put suitcases) but very clean and street view which I recommend asking for. The housekeeper even lent me her own umbrella on the last day!I was on 9th floor so one floor down from roof lounge with free coffee and internet all day and terrace to sit on at right time of year.Area felt very safe even walking from subway two blocks away late at night after failing to find a cab from theatre district.I will definitely use this hotel again on any future trip to New York."
83,1945,"Sep 21 2008 	Great location clean friendly	We chose to stay at The Marcel after consulting with Trip Advisor, and were not disappointed. It was very clean, maybe on the small side, but that is to be expected in Manhattan, and we did not spend much time in the room, except to sleep.The staff were very helpful and friendly. We did not eat at the hotel as there are lots of places in the vicinity to choose from. The only criticism we would have is that the capuccino machine was broken for three days! but we would definitely stay there again. We have to recommend Baluchis indian restaurant, this is just round the corner from The Marcel, the food and service was excellent."
84,1945,"Sep 14 2008 	Loved the Marcel	I loved this hotel. I chose it for location (wanted to stay near a friend's apartment) and every time I returned to the hotel I felt so good walking into the calm and chic atmosphere. I loved my room, the beautiful rooftop terrace, breakfast and, later in the day, the complimentary wine and cheese get-together. Fellow guests were international and may have been there for Fashion Week as I saw several models during my stay. I could walk to the Lower East Side from there and enjoyed all the areas inbetween. I would definitely stay there again."
85,1945,"Aug 3 2008 	Great service.	Stayed here 5 nights. Good lower midtown location. Not far from Madison square, nice area,walk a couple of blocks to the subway.Our room was spacious, clean, modern decoration. A great rooftop terrace, with complimentary wine and cheese between 6pm and 7pm when we stayed there, served by the wonderful Alex. Free coffee and internet access for 30 minutes in a lovely rooftop lounge room.Warm welcome from the receptionist and ever helpful staff. A smaller hotel so it feels more personal. Great little diner just down the road.Quiet enough area to give some respite from the 24 hour city fun.Don't hesitate to book this, its great. Only downside was our window faced inwards so we didn't really get much daylight. But you could ask for a street facing room if you want."
86,1945,"Jul 14 2008 	A Very Honest Review!	I just stayed at the Marcel for Fourth Of July. I was really worried because I had read ALOT of bad reviews about it on Yahoo. So, my honest and unbiased OPINION is this. It was in a decent neighborhood and was clean. A couple of the front desk people had no personality or welcoming skills but the door men were very courteous and accomadating. The rooms are nice but very small. Some of the main channels on the t.v didn't come in. The sinks are very weird and almost unusable for brushing your teeth and washing your face. The elevators some time take a long time to come. But, all in all, for the price, it was not horrible. Not Great but average."
87,1945,"Jul 8 2008 	excellent location! great staff!	The Marcel is in a nice location, many places to eat near the east side of NYC. If you are there for the 4th of July this is exactly where you want to be! Service and value are excellent. Great parks nearby, the subway is two short blocks away. Nice mixed, neighborhood, it's a no brainer."
88,1945,"Jul 6 2008 	Great hotel with friendly staff and god location	The Marcel is a good looking, small hotel with a good location close to Union Square etc. We stayed in a superior room that was nicely decorated and featured a view of the Empire State. We did encounter one major problem when checking in - the hotel was overbooked and we were transfered to another hotel. The next day, however, our room was available and we got money for our taxi fares. Id absolutely recomend this place."
89,1945,"Jun 27 2008 	great moderately priced hotel	We recently stayed at the Marcel Hotel for 1 week from 7-14 June. What a find!. We did a lot of searching on the internet to get just the right hotel for us and finally decided to take a gamble with The Marcel. We were apprehensive at first as, with all hotels on Trip Advisor, there are always negative reviews as well as positive. We were thrilled with our choice. The location is great - in Murray Hill in midtown Manhattan, a relatively quiet area for NY (hotel is on the corner of 3rd Avenue and E 24th St). We had booked a deluxe room and based on other travellers' comments we had asked for a corner room which we got on the 7th floor (the hotel is only 10 floors). It was ample big enough for us and had 2 large windows looking out to the Empire State Building which was nearby. The bathroom was fine and cleanliness was excellent. Check in staff were friendly as were the doormen. We did not notice any traffic noise from the 7th floor. However, the next door room had their music blaring loudly until 1am but the staff dealt with that once we complained. There is an attractive lounge on the 10th floor (with great views of the ESB) with free internet access and a great coffee machine (available from 11am) where we had the best cafe au laits in NY! The lounge led to a rooftop deck which had just been developed with attractive shrubs in planters and loungers to relax on after a hard day's trudging around NY sights. 3rd Avenue has great restaurants and we particularly enjoyed Bamiyan (Afghani) and the Vertigo Bar. Pick A Bagel a block away satisfied out breakfast pangs.What a great moderately priced hotel and what a great city. Can't wait to go back."
90,1945,"Jun 18 2008 	Average room excellent price sketchy website	I stayed at the Hotel Marcel in April 2008. This is a modern styled hotel in the Rose Hill neighborhood. The hotel room was overall adequate - it was bigger than I expected, but it had a slight air of residual smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. It wasn't bad enough for me to complain though, so I don't have any feedback on how the hotel would have dealt with this issue. The TV channel selection was pretty bad - many of the channels did not work. The bed was comfortable, but the street noise was a little bothersome. This is a problem with many hotels in Manhattan and it wasn't any worse than average NYC hotels. I did have an issue with booking my hotel - I booked through the hotel's web site (nychotels.com). While this clearly got me the best rate (less than $300 a night in Manhattan), the e-mail confirmation I got almost made me believe the web site was a fake. It looked very unofficial, and had my credit card number and expiration date in clear text. This is unacceptable in the modern internet era, in my opinion. I also only received a booking number, not a confirmation number. When I called to confirm my reservation, they could not find it at first (but they eventually did). I would recommend calling the hotel to confirm any reservation.Overall, the incredible price I was able to get for this room outweighed the minor flaws of the hotel. None of the items I've mentioned above had a negative impact on my stay, which is what I demand from a hotel."
91,1945,"Jun 2 2008 	Ultra Modern and trendy	Stayed here for a long weekend with my boyfriend. Room was small as expected but very clean and modern. Excellent decor. After the 1st night the ceiling in our bathroom started to fall down! We were moved straight away to a superior room, no hasstle at all. Location is good. Chelsea area of manhatten. You can get a taxi to the main attractions for about $10. Taxi from airport is a flat fee of $50. Staff were friendly and helpful. The only odd thing was there was no bar loacted inside the hotel. I don not drink but it was still a bit strange. Be carfeul not to TOUCH anythng inthe minibar unless u actually want it. They have sensors and if u remove any item for 20secs or more u pay for it! Flat screen tv's and ipod docking stations were a nice touch. Nice cafes nearby to get breakfast - try hidden city cafe for traditional pancakes, breakfast muffins and smoothies. Neares subway is only a 5 min walk away - although i would rather get a taxi!"
92,1945,Jun 2 2008 	Good value!	Stayed here with my husband on a 5 night holiday to NY. Hotel was lovely - nice boutique vibe and staff were friendly and helpful. Only problem was that we were next to the air con for the whole hotel and due to a problem it was very very noisy. Luckily we were so tired we slept through it but light sleepers would have struggled. That said I don't think its normally that bad as they were fixing it while we were there.Free cheese and wine in the evenings has been replaced with free nibbles with cocktails. Free coffee and internet still available and view of empire state from roof terrace was ace.Would recommend hotel - nice safe area and lots of local bars and restaurants. Would definitely stay there again.
93,1945,"May 4 2008	pleasant hotel	lovely hotel, good location, bit expensive, but that's manhattan, friendly staff and very helpfull, love to stay there again next time!!!!!"
94,1945,"May 1 2008 	Very Nice for the price.	After years of traveling to NYC a couple times a year for both business and pleasure, I became tired of paying $400+ a night for places like the W Union Square (which is a great hotel a few blocks from the Marcel). I was pleasantly surprised by the Marcel, which reminded me of the W on many levels.Check-in was a little rough as we were told the room type we requested was not available (2 doubles/ non-smoking). We were offered a room in one of there other hotels (all near midtown, no way). Then he said he had a room on a smoking floor, and that was fine. The room we walked into had 1 double bed, and was the smallest room I had ever seen, even if it was for 1 person. The room we finally got into was fine. The floor did smell of smoke, but not horribly. The room was fine, but the TV didn't work very well. We had an interior room on the second floor, so there was no view. The bathroom was sufficient and clean. The location was great for me.The computers and free coffee and tea on the 10th floor were great as well, although the elevator was very slow at times.I would just recommend not requesting a room with 1 bed, as I have a feeling they may all be this small."
95,1945,Apr 16 2008	Nice boutique hotel!	We stayed at the Marcel for 4 nights at the beginning of April &amp; had a great time! Hotel was clean and the room adequate for our stay. It was in a good area to walk to places or the subway was only 2 blocks away.There is a guest lounge on the 10th floor that offers complimentary tea &amp; coffee all day and two pcs with free internet access which is handy. Currently there isn't a bar/restaurant but one is being built at the moment....Overall a nice hotel in a good location that doesn't break the bank!
96,1945,"Apr 1 2008 	Overrated mediocre hotel	I just spent 7 nights at the Marcel so I have a pretty good sense of this hotel. They try to project a fancier image with doormen, funky decor and wine and cheese in the evening, but it didn't really live up to my expectations. My room--one bed-- was very, very tiny. I know it's New York, but when there's no place to put your suitcase, it's rough. The room decor is clashing but fun. I enjoyed the modern colors and prints. The biggest problem was the cleaning folks. Despite leaving our room repeatedly because they kept knocking on the door, the room still wasn't clean by 5:00 in the evening. I didn't feel comfortable with how well they cleaned. One day we came in to find the uncleaned room filled with cigarette smoke and the window open as if our room was the smoking lounge. I had to pay extra for the wireless service, which isn't cheap, and while it was adequate, it was rather slow. One plus was the front desk staff and doormen. They were always friendly and helpful. I think if this hotel works on improving their cleaning staff, it can get better, but you might want to ask if they have larger rooms."
97,1945,"Mar 28 2008 	Very Pleasant	With the location and the price, my expectations of this hotel were pretty low. I was quite surprised to find how nice the hotel was. The staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. Upon check-in I requested a quiet room. I know, a quiet room in NYC, dream on! Again, shockingly surprised to get an interior room that was so quiet you couldn't have guessed you were even in a city. The beds were harder than I like and the bathroom had one of those annoying new square shallow sinks, but the wine and cheese reception was warm and friendly. Don't miss the chance to step out on the terrace from the hospitality suite, what a view!!!Overall, a most pleasant experience, one I will seek out again!"
98,1945,Mar 13 2008	Really liked the Marcel	I thought it was excellent. I was staying on my own and had a massive bedroom which was slick and clean and groovy. Staff very helpful indeed and I was given a glass of sparkling wine the minute I checked in. A couple of downsides.. Bedroom terribly overheated. Loved the 10th floor where you get free internet and excellent coffee but the breakfast was very disappointing. Rock hard bagels and indifferent cereals. Don't waste your money when there are so many great places a 10 minute walk away. Overall I would definitely recommed it and would stay again.
99,1945,"Mar 12 2008 	Cheap 	For New York this is quite a resonably priced hotel-I stay in hotels quite frequently due to business and would give this hotel a 7/10, rooms were clean and had trendy decor. Good location for bars and food bad for shopping as at least 10 blocks away. Great TV!The only bad things about the room was obviosly small, odd layout as door opens onto your bed, bathroom okay style didnt fit rest of decor. NO VIEW-ours was of a bricked up alley. Resonably helpful staff.Nice stylish budget hotel."
100,1945,"Feb 20 2008 	LOVED The Marcel!!	I love this place! The Marcel is extremly clean, the staff are fantastic and our room was huge! The lounge on the tenth floor was great - computers with free internet access (great when you want to google a Restaurant), free coffee and tea, and an amazing roof deck! I booked it through hotels.com and got a deluxe room- we paid $250 a night, but it was definitly well worth it! Also, I called the Hotel and requested a corner room. They only have 1 corner room per floor, so be sure to call early. Parking was across the street for $27 per day. Great location - close to the village (about a $6 cab ride). All in all - I Loved this place and would recommend it to anyone! We stayed in room 607 and it was amazing."
101,1945,"Feb 18 2008 	Perfect In Everyway!!	My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night to celebrate valentines day. We arrived around 730pm and the check in was quick and simple, gave us our key and we were off. The entrance way had a wide fireplace built in th wall and a doorman. There was a parcking deck right across the street and for 24 hours they charge us 27$ which isnt that bad at all for parking in the city!We stayed in room 311. It was VERY tiny, but clean and very modern. The bathroom was clean and was pretty decent sized. The bed was comfortable except the fitted sheet wasnt very tight and kept moving when i moved.Liquor store and convenience store right around the corner.Cab to Lafayette was only 10$.Check out was simple and quick as well!!I would DEF recommend this hotel to couples... its worth the money!!!"
102,1945,"Feb 5 2008 	Loved the Marcel	I loved this hotel. It was decorated the way I would love to have my place done. It was modern and sleek.. the rooms are small, but it is NYC. I didn't care much for the shallow bathroom sink, but the bathroom was very well appointed.All in all: I loved this place and totally will stay there again!"
103,1945,"Feb 2 2008 	Plumbing disaster	As others have written there were serious problems with the plumbing during mid-late January. Throughout our week stay we had no water, then cold water, then no water again, then the plumbing started to make really loud noises, then no water, ect. Although front desk sent someone to deal with the problem - nothing was solved and we had to live with it.The room was also very hot and we had to have the window open at all times even though it was below freezing outside throughout our stay.The staff were polite and helpful and the rooms were clean.The hotel is in an excellent location for both uptown and downtown in a quiet and safe location."
104,1945,"Jan 31 2008 	So So	Stayed here on business end of January. Room are small, shower was cold. Room lay out was odd. Not a fan of the decor. It was clean and the staff were friendly."
105,1945,"Jan 29 2008 	Quality Room Great Rate 	Stayed Sunday through Tuesday mid Jan 2008. Got super recently updated room on 4th floor facing Third Avenue. Quick, friendly service at the desk and lobby. Tenth floor lounge never crowded, with free computers and internet access. Internet wireless in room great, although cost is $10/day extra. Shower water was cool two of the days around noon. Front desk didn't know why. Good location for subway and bus travel. Not a good choice if you can afford $500/night but a great choice if you can't."
106,1945,"Jan 29 2008 	great hotel highly recommended	Did some research and got a good rate through hotels.co.uk Room was not huge but big enough, immaculately cleaned each day, and hotel staff very friendly and courteous. The free internet, coffee, cheese and wine were great touches. Checked out at 5am (!) on last day which was effortless and taxi arranged by concierge even arrived early. Subway a 10 minute walk away. Area great - you should definitely take time to explore the bars and restaurants up 3rd avenue. Negatives are the noise from the road (especially from the drilling at 5am!!), no kettle in room (maybe this is a very English thing!), and room was initially too hot (I figured out you open the heater great to adjust this however). Would stay there again, it's quirky, clean and convenient."
107,1945,"Jan 7 2008	credit card fraud here!	The hotel itself is nice however immediately following the last two business trips I took and stayed at this hotel there were fraudulent charges for airfare to various places around the world placed on my credit card. Again, this happened twice with two different credit cards. My colleague suffered the same fate!Be careful!"
108,1945,"Jan 4 2008 	Okay-- if you get a room bigger than a closet!	We booked this room through Expedia and after reading previous reviews, we clearly ended up the worst room in the entire hotel!! I called in two weeks earlier to request a corner room with a view. What I got-- the smallest hotel room I've ever seen, averaging about 90 degrees in temp, with a view of an alleyway. Honestly, this hotel room was just about big enough for a small double bed, a mini fridge and a couple of bedside lamps. Once you added in two humans, and two pieces of luggage there was about 2' sq of floor space left. And the temperature of the room-- we couldn't even sleep under the covers, even after we'd left the windows open. The staff were extremely unhelpful as well. More than willing to expect $5 to carry your bags the 2 feet to the elevator, but unwilling to ring you back if you have a problem. We called reception to request another room (we had paid $350 a night for this closet of a room and it was directly next to the elevators!) and they said they would check if they had another room and call us back. They never did. When we rang again to check up, and to ask for someone from maintenance to check out the heating problem we were told there were no other rooms and that the problem with the heating &quot;was happening to all of New York-- just open your windows&quot;. Nice.Please, please please spend your $350/night elsewhere. This is a terrible place, which was so disappionting. Great neighborhood, terrible hotel-- unless you like sleeping in a small, noisy, box-like sauna."
109,1945,"Jan 2 2008 	Would stay again in a heartbeat!	Stayed there for 4 nights after Christmas and was most impressed with the Marcel. On check in, we were greeted with a glass of champagne, and then when we asked if it was possible to get a room with a view, the check in staff gave us an awesome room, with a direct view of the Empire State Building.The room was more than big enough for the two of us with a great dual shower! (But nothing could beat that view!)Throughout the stay, the staff were always extrememly helpful and were fun and chatty.The location was great with the surrounding area full of cafes, restaruants and nice little shops, plus the subway was only 2 blocks away.I would recommend this hotel without hesitation to anyone."
110,1945,"Dec 27 2007 	Renovations Worth Waiting For!	We stayed one night the weekend before Christmas to see the Seurat exhibit at the MOMA. We had stayed about nine months before in early summer. At that time the hotel was completing a much needed renovation. We were not lucky enough to get a renovated room that time and the room showed its wear. I remember feeling quite disappointed that the room was much more drab and worn than the display photos showed. This visit the renovations were finished and the hotel was transformed. The lobby and reception area are tasteful, comfortable, and (particularly welcome in December) features a sitting area with a gas fireplace. The person at the reception desk was friendly, helpful, and happy to explain to us that while the hotel no longer offered free espresso in the lobby, they did offer free coffee in the tenth floor lounge. Our room, this time, was on the tenth floor. The hotel now has two elevators, one larger and one very small. I only remember one at our last stay. On the tenth floor were several rooms and the lounge. This area had the promised free coffee, a large flat screen TV and two computer stations offering free internet access (one was not operational). When we entered our room we were shocked. It featured a sitting area with two white leather arm chairs, a white leather lounger seat with a footstool, a snack bar and stocked refrigerator, and a flat screen TV. The carpet was new, clean, and with a simple narrow black and white stripe. Pushing our way through a set of double frosted glass doors we found a room with a king sized bed, another flat screen TV and a closet. Peeking into the bathroom we saw new modern fixtures, a hand-held shower, and the deepest bath (with jets!) I'd ever seen in a hotel. Nervously we called down to the front desk to make sure of our rate (a fantastic rate, prepaid though Expedia) and to make sure there'd been no mistake. The person apologized for frightening us and said that he gave us a free upgrade to the best room available, he thought we'd like it. Well, we did. I know that we were in an atypical room, more deluxe than one we would usually stay in, but the entire hotel was clean, tastefully decorated in a simple black and white theme, and staffed with friendly, helpful people. There were only a couple of issues that could be improved. There was an issue with the cable TV in our room and while we had many of the channels we could not get the pay-per-view to work. That was a disappointment. One of the computers in the tenth floor lounge was not operational and it would have been helpful if there was a sign on it that informed of this fact. Our room and bathroom was spotlessly cleaned, but when I filled the tub and used the jets it became obvious that they had sat unused for quite a while because they shot out some black flecks that looked like mold had developed in the jets. No big deal, and fixable by filling the tub and operating the jets on a more regular basis. So, a clean, safe, well staffed hotel in a safe neighborhood two blocks from the subway with some very minor maintenance issues. We'll be back!There is a 24 hour diner a block away and a coffee shop just across the street from that. There is also your typical small NY market that sells just about everything; we were able to buy the toothpaste we'd forgotten to pack and the bottled sparkling water we prefer to drink."
111,1945,"Dec 22 2007 	Few problems but nice stay	After reading the reviews, i was having second thoughts but i'm glad i stayed. the boyfriend and i were originally booked for the standard room, but upgraded to deluxe when noticing the price for deluxe was only $10 the night before. Cons:-the toilet didn't flush, but the boyfriend fooled around and fixed it within 3 min, so nothing big.-they didn't have their pay per view or On demand setup.-TV was a little blurry-mini bar was overly priced-the last morning we were there, we heard some random loud drilling and hammering around 7 or 8 am, not good. Pros-clean-nice neighborhood-great shower!!-convenientall around i Would stay there again, its not the plaza, but its adequate and nice."
112,1945,"Dec 3 2007 	Extremely 	After reading the reviews of the Marcel here on trip advisor i was prepared for disappointment. I had wanted to stay at 60 Thompson or The Chambers (both 4/5 star boutique hotels where i've had pleasant stays previously, and both double the price of the Marcel), but they were totally booked out - as were all the other options i would have taken over this particular hotel.On arrival my concerns were not exactly alleviated when i was told by reception that there was no hot water AND no telephone / internet service: both facilites were being 'upgraded' and would not be available until the following day.Not a good start.However, i had made the effort of contacting the hotel directly two weeks before travelling and secured a corner room on a high floor. This truned out to be a VERY good move because the room was utterly wonderful: it was large (larger than rooms at either 60 Thompson or The Chambers), furnished in a very hip yet very sophisticated style, and everything from the carpet to the bed to the leather desk to the flat screen tv to the i-pod dock clock-radio appeared to be brand, spanking new.I had two huge, beautiful windows and a double aspect view. Even the bathroom was a pleasant surprise - much better than expected after looking at the 'reviewers' photos on this website. If you ever stay at this hotel - definitely try and secure a corner room (there's only one per floor).There was a fully stocked mini-bar (but interestingly without any alcohol) and the extra ameneties were as good, if not better, than any boutique hotel.The following morning the hot water was back on and the telephone was working fine, with no more problems for the duration of my 4 night stay.There were two great, traditional diners just two blocks from the hotel, and a great bar / restaurant called VERTIGO serving some truly excellent contemporary American food (and - amazingly - English cider!).The bottom line? There really is no need to spend double the money. Excellent stay - i'd definitely go back, but they'd have to guarantee me that corner room!"
113,1945,"Dec 3 2007 	Nice for the right price...	After reading the reviews here on Trip Advisor, I approached the Marcel with some caution. It turned out okay, no major complaints, but not exactly the best value either.Some caveats: this was supposed to be a romantic getaway weekend for the wife and &amp; I, and we looked pretty casually for a place until about a month before. As it turned out, the first weekend in Nov. is Marathon weekend in NYC. No wonder all the rooms disappeared seemingly overnight. What we were left with was little choice, and much higher rates than expected.The review: The Marcel is a standard european style boutique hotel with a modern decor. You see these places popping up all over the last few years. Most recently we stayed at the Roger Williams (back in '03) for dirt cheap ($140/nt), but now it's almost $500 a night.The rooms in the Marcel (we saw 2) are small - 9' x 12' or so. The beds are nicely sized, but take up a lot of room. Add up the small dressers, mini fridge, and night tables and it becomes pretty tight. This was not a surprise, as most hotels like this are similarly laid out.The bed was comfy, and linens were soft and fresh. No laundry or bleach smells. The Bathroom was really tight, but ample. The shower was a walk-in style, which I'll save for the &quot;Cons&quot; part of the review.The Closet was small, but adequate, the &quot;dressers&quot; consisted of a 2 whole drawers and a space below. The night tables each had a drawer, but we just put our extra clothes in a pile on the floor next to the bed.We had room 910, which had a huge window overlooking 24th st. This provided a respite from what would have otherwise been a claustrophobic experience. Plenty of light and air (thru open windows). Not an inspiring view, but nice to have one just the same. Close the blinds at night, unless you don't mind being on display for the apartment building across the street - they sure don't....Based on reviews here, I originally asked for a room away from the stairs. We were given 501, I believe. It had a view of the interior of the building - essentially a black brick wall. The room was a scosh bigger, but the wife said no way. So they moved us up to 910. No stair issues to contend with, however it was right next to the elevators. This proved to be a non-issue, even on a weekend. Very little noise there, or from outside, for that matter. Unless you're visiting from rural Montana, I think you'd find it surprisingly quiet.The Bad:Walk-in shower. Why do hotels insist on this? the curtains leave a 2 inch gap and spray soaks the whole floor. Ask for an extra towel.Mini-bar. I'm going to agree with the reviewer who said to leave space for my stuff too. Not only is the contents ridiculously overpriced, but there's a tray on top stocked with goodies that sit on little sensors. If an item is removed for more than 20 seconds it gets charged to your account automatically (WTF?!!). Insideous, no? We moved the tray out of the way and used it for our own crap.Outlets. These days, most travelers come packed like a gadget store: cell phone, digital camera, video camera, iPod, laptop, etc. and all these things come with charger. Knowing this, why are the outlets tucked away under the night tables (that don't move), virtually unreachable, and filled with lamp and clock plugs? Sure, there's one by the TV, but it's 3 feet of the floor, better hope your little charger doesn't fall out. Would a courtesy outlet be so wrong?....In a nutshell:Nice decor, Nice neighborhood - (Pick-a-Bagel 2 blocks south was awesome) quiet, plenty of amenities nearby, #6 train 2 blocks east.Friendly staff, willing to accomodate if asked. Clean, small rooms. Inconvenient outlets, and a somewhat messy shower.Would I stay again? if the price dropped $200, yes.Take a look at my review for the WalkNYC (.com) private walking tour we did. Highly Recommended."
114,1945,"Nov 27 2007	cold shower	we had cold showers for 4 days and the reception really didn't care. they didn't even know what MOMA was and when the museums were open. the central heating was broke for 1 day. but the rest of the hotel (beds, location, furniture) was ok."
115,1945,"Nov 26 2007 	A Sweet Stay at the Marcel	After reading several of the reviews of the Marcel, I was seriously worried about what to expect when we arrived for our 5-night November 2007 stay. But when we arrived, My husband and I, as well as our friends we traveled with, were so pleased with what we found! The hotel, after going through renovations this past summer, was in great condition. Modern, simplistic &amp; clean are the words I'd use to best describe the accommodations. Although we had booked the base-level room, we found we were upgraded to a slightly larger room with a king bed, which was incredibly comfortable. Unlike other travelers who reviewed this hotel, we had no trouble with the temperature of our room and had no issue with noise. This was our first trip to NY and we were pleased with how centrally located the Marcel was. Easy access to the subway, and short walks or cab rides everywhere. We'd stay at the Marcel again anytime and would definitely recommend it."
116,1945,"Oct 28 2007 	Noisiest Boutique Hotel ever!	I've stayed at the Marcel three times. The reason I came back is that even though the rooms are minscule, they are nicely appointed - everything is new so it gives you the impression you're staying at a more upscale hotel - even though for Manhattan, I would describe this as mid-priced. The problem is that for this stay - I was on the third floor - so fairly well accessible by stairwells as opposed to the elevator - which is programmed such that it will skip your floor to make the total round trip - getting as many people into it before stopping to get you... frustrating to watch it wizz by you several times before stopping... sigh. In any event, because of the low floor, the stairwell doors never stopped slamming. Also, the hotel staff with the luggage carts bang their way through the halls without regard for how much noise they're making! All the maintenance staff - housekeeping etc. are very nice. But I've found the front desk staff to be variable - and in my three times here, I have never seen the same person 2x. Well I can say the same for the 5 star where I stay in Seattle (for the same price I might add as this 2.5 - 3 star hotel in Manhattan). I would stay here again, I guess. Because in Manhattan your choices for good price are limited. Bring earplugs!"
117,1945,"Oct 27 2007 	Worst stay ever in any hotel	The room was to have been a queen - got a double. You could literally stand on the bed and touch the two side walls. We arrived when it was 50 degrees outside - but our room was at least 85 - likely closer to 90. The gummi bears on the honor bar were melted...no lie. When we turned on the window AC unit - it blew hot air, the rather useless front desk staff advised us that it was &quot;Central Air&quot; and that it was turned off for the season and to open a window, which we did but then spent the night listenting to a parade of fire trucks, garbage trucks and wondering when we would be visited by a pigeon. the floors on the thrid floor gave to a degree that it made one feel that they would drop through, the sheets smelled not so pleasant and the fridge was also only good for heating things.....a truly horrid stay - stay at a hostel for better ammenities and cheaper."
118,1945,"Oct 24 2007	A Practical Affordable Place to Stay	I would say to anyone looking for reasonably affordable hotel accomodation in New York, this is a good option. The location's good, the staff are fine, there's a great breakfast place down the road and our room was recently refurbished, very clean and comfortable.It's always hard to find nice affordable places in big cities, but this is a sound choice."
119,1945,"Oct 15 2007	Good value now building work completed	Spent 4 nights there in a standard room and would recommend it to those looking for a good value no frills hotel. Like others I wondered what I had let myself in for when I read some of the earlier reviews but the stay was actually quite pleasant. All the building work appears to be over and both the lifts were working. Room was small but not unduly so for a hotel of this class in NYC and they had done what they could with the furnishings to give it a bit of style. Very clean and fixtures mostly new. All the staff I dealt with were efficient and helpful. The aircon was a bit noisy and, while there were instructions for a room safe, the room didn't actually contain one ! I also agree that the minibar was overpriced and superfluous. But overall a good play to stay and we'd come back here. Liked the area too- not far from the Lexington Avenue line and plenty of restaurants in 3rd Avenue."
120,1945,"Sep 24 2007	What a great little hotel	After reading the reviews on The Marcel, I would have to say I was alittle worried but the location was perfect for the work I needed to do in NYC. I am here to say that the Marcel met and exceeded my expectations. Their customer service was exceptional the decor was right up my alley and the size of the room, perfect and the room was very clean. Lets face it folks if your in NYC and spending your day in a hotel room something is seriously wrong with you.The location was very close to public transport , most hotels in NYC you have to walk to the subway, whats a couple of blocks when your in the best city in the world to walk in. Now some of you who had a negative experience at the Marcel are reading this review and saying she never travels, oh I travel, and I travel alot and I make it a point to stay in great hotels.cheers to The Marcel and I will be back to stay with several of my friends in Feb of 08 for a week."
121,1945,"Sep 23 2007	Great place to stay very clean but not without problems	We stayed at the Marcel hotel in a Deluxe room for two nights and actually loved in from the beginning. Rooms are like shown on the internet pics, very clean, with love to details, and we actually were able to look right onto the empire state from our beds.I especially loved the bathroom, which hasa rain shower and a great Art Deco look.The happiness lastet till 7 a.m. the next morning, when one of our neighbours had a shower and we had to discover that the hotel has some problems with the pressure in the water pipes, which ends up in a terrible noise. The front desk manager told us the problem was new and they'd try to fix it that same day, but as we were told later on by a technican, the problem actually is well known there. After quite a lot of disussion they upgrated us to a suite for the second night, which then in fact was really great, and without a noise.Overall, a great hotel, besides the waterpipes. I'd recommend it, but if you book a room there, make sure you're not on the 9th floor (thats were they have the problem)."
122,1945,"Aug 29 2007 	I'll come back if...	A great central location. Not too loud, really: it is New York City, after all. Two things I will need next time:An empty fridge! I don't want to buy your over priced sodas, waters and beers! I would like to store my own, less expensive and more palatable items in the fridge! I would also like to have a local phone directory in my room.The room we had was small but adequate. Clean and comfortable.The air conditioner was rather loud.Pleasant staff. Yes, one of the two lifts is (still) not in service.thanks,tomh"
123,1945,"Aug 19 2007 	Be sure to check what your getting!	I stayed at The Hotel Marcel twice in August 2007, once from the 6th-11th and again from the 17-18th, with my mother.I am aware the place is being renovated, and it was looking much better at the time of my second stay, however I believe that some features should have been sorted out before the hotel opened.My initial impression of the Hotel wasn't great, the outside looked rather tacky with brown covers in the brown windows giving the impression that the place had closed down. Inside however it was modern and very tastefully decorated, albeit a little too cold due to excessive use of air conditioning. At the time of my first stay only one lift was working, this was very slow, with wallpaper peeling off the walls and wires hanging out it would not have been very safe for a small child. The room (one with two beds) though like the Hotel lobby, tastefully decorated, was rather small, once suitcases had been placed on the floor (two) there was little space on the ground to move. The big flat screen TV looked rather out of place on a room of this size. Fortunatley it was not too hot and stuffy in the room, as the air conditioning unit was rather noisy, causing problems particularly at night. The walls were very thin and traffic could be heard the whole night and on the last three nights when the road outside was dug up from about 6am we could hear the drill being used. The bathroom however was clean &amp; tidy with amenities such as soap, shampoo, conditioner and a rather useless shower cap provided (I suggest you bring your own). The shower was a fixed one located in the bath and if you wanted a hot shower you could not control the ammount of water coming out, meaning that water would go everywhere.The Hotel is not in that central a location, it takes about 30-40 mins on a bus or subway train to get to Times Square and there is no restaurant as it is currently being renovated (despite claims on many websites that it is open).On the 2nd stay despite requesting a 2 bed room my mother &amp; I ended up in a one bed room which was so cramped and dark, (the window was round the corner and did not let any natural light into the room) that despite the fact we were only staying one night we asked to move. Luckily they did have a two bed room free which was much bigger and lighter.By this time the 2nd lift was working and the 1st one had been renovated, though the restaurant was still closed.If you end up staying at this hotel, even if you'll be on your own do request a two bed room and check that is what you'll be getting."
124,1945,"Aug 16 2007 	Not good at all	We had a very bad experience at the Marcel. When we arrived, the window blinds were not working properly (they would not go down all the way). I asked them to have someone come up and fix them while we went out. When we got back later in the evening, they were still not fixed. I had to ask again the next day. The second day there, housekeeping did not leave us any washcloths or soap so I had to ask for that. On the third day, housekeeping left us absolutely NO towels. My daughter noticed that when she finished her shower!! I had to ask for them to bring us some towels while she stood there dripping wet. When we checked out they tried to charge me $32 for items from the mini-bar which we did not use. I had to wait until they got a hold of someone to go upstairs and verify everything was still there. The clerk never apologized for the billing mistake, or for making us wait."
125,1945,"Aug 14 2007	Tell the staff what you need.	I probablly would stay here again for the price. But I would note, The water temp was just barely warm and there was just one TV station. I called downstairs, I was told the same thing about both calls. They would tell their management and In 5 minutes both things were fixed. The halls were clean but they were FULL of towels and sheets on the stairs (I guess they don't have much workable space) The staff was friendly, they told me where a good home cooked breakfast place was. They don't have breakfast in the hotel. My room was small but very clean. The hotel is still in some remodeling (not a lot) but what has been done seems to have been done by someone who didn't do good finish work (nail holes in the molding had been filled but wasn't sanded or painted over, very nice marble in the bath but the sprinkler had not been caulked around, carpet has a nice modern pattern but the carpet installers didn't lay it straight with the wall, a lot of little unfinished things.) BUT there was a flat screen TV, an ipod radio, nice bathroom, modern furnishings, I was a single woman and I felt safe. Next time I would ask for a room with a chair, I told them I wanted 5th floor or above because of the traffic noise and a non smoking room, they accomadated evererything I asked."
126,1945,"Aug 3 2007 	Very good hotel	We have just returned from a week at the Marcel hotel. The hotel is very clean and we have never experienced such incredible service before. There is also a ipod station on the rooms, wake up with your own music and you can charge your ipod.Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday and I am very positive about it.Will defenitly return back to the Marcel next year."
127,1945,"Jul 20 2007 	Extremely clean very modern fantastic location would definitely book this hot	We stayed for 3 nights at the Marcel in July. Yes, the room was small, but you should expect that for NYC. The room was extremely clean, plenty of space in the bathroom with hairdryer and a small shelf (enough for toiletries), an armoire and dresser for your clothes, iron &amp; ironing board, a mini fridge, a flat screen tv, comfy bed, pillows and comforter and a desk. The only upset was we forgot our ipodthe alarm clock had an ipod cradle!! There is only 1 working elevator, the other is used for construction, which means we had to wait one whole minute for an elevator! OMG...the horror! In case you didnt get it, that was sarcasm! There are numerous restaurants and bars in the area as well. Also a grocery store just down the street. We didnt go back to the hotel till late most nights, streets were still busy, and safe to walk. Doormen were always nice as was all the other staff. There is no valet parking, but youre in NYC, youd be crazy to have a car in the first place! A 4 minute walk to the green subway line., which is incredibly convenient. Buy a $7 day pass and go all over the city.This hotel is in the perfect location, it's half way between uptown (times sq, TOTR, grand central, central park, etc) and downtown (financial district, battery park, chinatown, wtc, etc.) walk a few blocks to madison sq park and eat at the Shake Shack it's worth the wait!!Dont let others discourage you from this place, everyone else standards must be super high or they are just really picky. The price was great for this hotel and I would definately stay here again the next time I visit.I took pictures as proof the room is really nice, but I dont have them right now. If you want to see, i'll gladly provide them."
128,1945,"Jul 15 2007 	Very Comfortable for A Night	Me and a friend came in from out of town to dance the night away in the city and the Marcel seemed like a good deal when we found it online. It looks a little different from virtual tours online on some travel websites, but it still looks very nice and very modern and clean. The elevator is undergoing renovations, so it didn't look its best. But the room, decor, and staff more than made up for such a minor detail. The rooms, though small, are very comfortable, especially for a one night stay. I actually wish we would've stayed another night to really appreciate the cappuccino bar and sleep-in in the comfortable beds. I really feel like we lucked out with the Marcel."
129,1945,"Jun 28 2007 	Avoid this hotel	I left this hotel feeling very, very angry. One half of the front desk was an absolute joke. Unhelpful, slow, discurtious at best. I've stayed at dozens of hotels in NY and found this, my worst experience in 5 years. The hotel itself seemed to be unfinished. Electrical panels layed bare outside my room, the lift appeared to falling apart. My room was spacious but smelt damp. This is a mid priced hotel but I wish I'd spent a few bucks more and gone elsewhere."
130,1945,"Jun 26 2007 	Loved the room	I too have stayed in several NYC hotels and found the room at the Marcel to be of average size but extremely clean and comfortable. The bathroom was very small but since I was travelling alone that was not an issue. I also found the front desk staff to be very courteous however I did not get my requested wake up call on one of the mornings. Luckily the IHome alarm clock worked. The doormen/bell staff were another matter. When I cam back in the afternoons they were generally sitting outside be the front door (which was propped open) smoking. Also one of them offered me a &quot;deal&quot; on airport transportation ($40 to LaGuardia). When I explained that I had paid $32 including tip to get there he got huffy. I had to go out on 3rd Ave. and get my own cab--fortunately that was not a problem. Also with regard to transportation, The Marcel is a bit far from subway stops, escpecially those to the theater district."
131,1945,"Jun 23 2007 	amazing hotel for the price	After all the doom and gloom I read on line, the Marcel was amazing, and I stay in hotels in NY at least once a month. Harry at the front desk was not only cute but extremely personable and nice. I have already recommended this hotel to friends. The room looked just like the picture (spacious by NY terms). I would give it a 1/2 star less than the Hudson Hotel (and considerably cheaper!) a star less than the Hyatt or Intercontinental (which is hundreds of dollars more)and the room was better than the Paramount (but the Paramount's lobby is nicer) at approximately the same price."
132,1945,Jun 14 2007 	Dont stay here!!!	Stayed at this hotel for one night only and it was terrible!! The staff were useless and totally unhelpful/rude. The room smelt of damp and had ants in it and the corridors were dingy and unfinished. It was a total waste of money and should never be described as a boutique hotel!! Ive had better service at Mcdonalds!!
133,1945,"Jun 9 2007 	You get what you pay for...	I knew that the Marcel was a &quot;boutique hotel&quot;. The rooms may seem small to some people...but I thought my room size was ok. No chest of drawers through, and this could be annoying for anyone who doesn't like living out of their suitcase. There was a closet to hang items. I did find my room, which faced 3rd Ave., very, very loud. You could hear every street sound, dog barking, etc ... even with the air conditioner running. I would recommend getting a different room, if you find city noise annoying. Service was fine. Lastly, the area had reasonably priced places to eat. Important because the Marcel does not have room service. The area of the city felt comfortable and safe (however, I wasn't out after dark)."
134,1945,"May 28 2007 	Quieter than midtown	The Marcel is in Gramercy Park/Flat Iron region and as such is quieter than midtown but with as many attractions. A short walk to the Flat iron building, across from a small park, surrounded by coffee shops and restaurants. You are never too far from a Starbucks as there appear to be lots and lots of them. The hotel is undergoing renovation as I write, but the lobby and lots of the rooms are complete - and very stylish. The hotel restaurant appeared to have been closed for some time and is currently being redecorated. Plenty of good restuarants on 3rd and 2nd Avenues. Try out Bao Noodle, and Andreas'. There are two lifts to all floors but only one was working as construction on the higher floors was going on. The front desk staff were always very helpful.The coffee/cappucino machine in the lobby lounge was free and easy to use. Recommended for tourists who don't want the bright lights of Times Square. Nearest subway was three avenues walk away, about 5-8 minutes."
135,1945,"May 26 2007 	Too expensive for what you get	Rooms are way too small, do not like a duvet cover for my bedspread. It was very clean which is important to me but way too expensive. Would I stay here again? Only if they lowered the rate! It cost me $325 a night and it needs to be improved but if it's the only hotel you can find, it's not that, that bad!!"
136,1945,"May 15 2007	Stay Away!!!	Where do I begin? We chose the Marcel to celebrate our 3rd anniversary. Booked through Expedia for 3 nights - and got treated second class the minute we arrived. This was our first and last trip to NYC - we are hesitant to go again. First, the room was stifling hot and looked like a college dorm. They came twice to try and fix the window a/c unit, leaving a sharp metal filter sticking half way out. The front desk clerk, who called himself the 'manager&quot; (later found out he was not) lied to us about having no other rooms available. Rather than give us another room, the clerk suggested we cab it to one of their sister hotels across the city - even though we had prepaid for 3 nights at the Mercer! Well we had it out with him at the front desk and he became more arrogant by the minute. But after I nearly passed out from the heat, we were shown 2 available rooms, with A/C only 2 floors up. Now, don't even try to disturb the front staff when they are talking to their friends on cell phones...So, our new room, was 'better' - we were moved around 11:30 pm. However, that same night, we were awakened bysomeone slamming the doors in the hallway and oh yes, bed bugs! Paper thin walls, some rooms with A/C, some rooms with bugs - wow! I tried to open the curtain only to see bird droppings all over the window, and we were looking out onto the main A/C unit (ironic since we had no a/c in the first room!). . Whenever we asked for help in directions or recommendations as to where to go, we were given no help whatsoever. We were even told 'no, we don't have a cork screw' by the same idiot at the front desk, only to have someone else bring one up. Talk about personal! Then, our room was supposedly 'cleaned' but they left our wine glasses dirty (we needed lots to survive our experience - we basically avoided the hotel for anything but sleep) they didn't clean those, so we returned to a room FULL of fruit flies and spent the entire evening trying to get rid of them.It was the most horrendous experience - and I've stayed in 1 star hotels in Europe better than this! When we asked for a room change or refund, we were told 'deal with expedia, you booked through them' so we had no choice but to endure it all. Well, we did follow up and Expedia refunded us 1 night stay based on our horrific experience there. You'd be better off sleeping on a bench in central park!"
137,1945,"May 14 2007 	Nothing Wrong with the Marcel Hotel	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Marcel for three nights. We booked it mainly for the price, the location, and the duvet covers - I really don't like sleeping in a bed with an unwashed bedspread. We had read a lot of bad reviews on TripAdvisor, but will admit to being swayed by the reviewer who wrote, &quot;Are you going to New York to hang out in a hotel room or see the city?&quot;We had a room with a king size bed, which had these great tall bookshelves and a leather cushioned headboard, a desk and chair, a wardrobe, and a chic white leather chair. Our view was non-existant. The window had these great black-out curtains that made you feel like you were sleeping in the womb. The bathroom was clean, but the tub's enamel was chipped. The carpet was a little torn up, but kind of cool and funky. There was some construction going on in the hotel, but whatever they were doing didn't bother us, and we're both light sleepers. We were on the third floor, in a room at the very end of the long and winding hallway, so maybe that's why we didn't hear anything (?). Overall, the Marcel Hotel was just fine. They held our bags for us, ordered car service, loaned us a corkscrew, etc., so we didn't have a problem with the service. The free cappucino machine didn't make great coffee, but it was free and okay in a pinch. The room itself was clean, quiet, and more than reasonably priced. What more can you ask for, people???"
138,1945,"May 9 2007 	Shockingly Bad	I have to say that out of all the NY hotels I have stayed at this was by far the worse. I realize it was a 2.5 star hotel so I didn't have a lot of expectations. However, I did expect to be placed in a room that I would get sleep and not be woken up at 7:00 am to drilling and hammering, loud construction workers, and then be able to perhaps watch a movie before 9:00 pm without feeling I was sitting on a jack hammer. The service was abysmal, and with the many choices in NY for hotels I would suggest looking somewhere else."
139,1945,"Apr 30 2007 	Warning about the Marcel Hotel	I want to warn you about this hotel, I stayed there last fall, they put someone else's charges on my creditcard in addition to my own charges, refused to admit that they made a mistake, finally the creditcard company took the charge off my account, but this other person got a free stay on the credit card company's expense, maybe a friend?, I can not recommend this hotel"
140,1945,"Apr 4 2007	Awful!!	I stayed here because it looked nice online and was fairly close to my relative's apartment. The bed was practically touching both walls...definitely the tiniest room I've ever stayed in. Fairly noisy, too. Near Baruch college, so convenient if that is where you need to be. Otherwise, fairly out of the way of everything. We were on the 5th floor, and the elevator (yes, singular not plural) was broken. UGH...Staff not very friendly nor helpful. I thought the decor of the lobby area was nice. The coffee/cappuccino machine in the lobby was broken as well. I DEFINITELY wouldn't stay there again, nor would I recommend it."
141,1945,"Mar 19 2007 	Shocked by the terrible service	I stayed at this hotel a few years ago. I thought iI might have had a uniquely bad experience, but upon reading the others reviews, it appears that not much has changed. I loved the decor and design of the hotel but was deeply disappointed with the service.My friend and I arrived, to discover we had not been given the twin room requested, but one double bed. The night manager obliged by moving us to a room with a king-sized bed to try to get more room between us. In that room, the toilet didn't work, so they moved us up to a nicer room with two double beds. Some time later he called and said we had to leave that room as it was no longer available. I guess they decided to sell the room to someone else after placing us in there.We were then moved back down to a smaller room with one double bed, worse than our first room. This is three room changes in one night, because of their mistake. We were never moved to room resembling the one reserved after that. We were never apologized to, or offered any incentive to continue our stay, or to return to this hotel. The day manager was extremely rude. and devoid of customer service skills. Thisi has been the only time I have written a complaint letter to a hotel, but despite sending several letters explaining what happened, I was neither contacted nor acknowledged in any way.The Marcel or The Mistake?"
142,1945,"Jan 30 2007 	Are you going to Live in the Room or sleep there?	Why were we in NYC? Well, I'll say this much: it wasn't to stay in a hotel room. I had my expectations for the price I was paying, but the bed was VERY comfortable for the price. I've paid four times what I paid here and have had the very same bed with super soft linens. I admit that the unmentioned renovation in the lobby made me worry, and that the room was small. But lets be real, we couldn't hear the workers at all. And the two of us were comfortable. I admit some trepidation after some of these reviews, but I think that most people book with the expectation of a hotel like you'd get in the suburb, with extra sprawling space. If you need a room to do cartwheels, this isn't your place.But this is NYC people. Get out there and see the sights, and then take a nap in that awesome bed."
143,1945,"Jan 23 2007 	Hmmm not sure I would stay here again great bed despite all	It's taken me a long time to write this review. I only remembered when I was using this webpage to research another hotel. Anyway, my husband and I stayed in the Marcel Hotel in July 2006 for 6 nights. The hotel looked great in the hotel website, so I decided to book it through a travel agency despite the bad reviews I read here. I just thought some people might be a bit picky, but they were not entirely wrong!!!!!!!!!Upon arrival we were faced with the construction work, which was not really a problem for us, as we got up early every day. We were there in July, and from the reviews I'm reading, it's still going on, so I would wait. As for the room, I must say I had requested a corner room with a view, but this request was not met, claiming the hotel was full, so we were allocated a room on the 1st floor, along a dark corridor. The room was quite small (the norm in NY), but manageable. One good point was the bed, which was really really comfortable with a fluffy duvet. On the downside, as you can see in the photographs, the TV was in the closet, so we barely had room for our clothes, just 2 shelves and 2 tiny drawers that didn't open and close properly. A cheap piece of furniture. The window blind didn't go up properly. And another nightmare was the air conditioning, which was too noisy. As for the bathroom, no complaints there, it was spotless. It had a full bath with a shower. We had clean toilets and new toiletries every day, although we bought our own bottles of shampoo, shower gel etc, as I don't usually like the ones hotels provide.As for the service I must say that on the 1st day I went down to reception to ask for a safe to put our valuables (passport...). I was told there was no safe in reception or in the rooms... I asked them to let me know when one of the nicer rooms vacated so we could change, but they never did. Not the best service, I must say. They were always polite, but they didn't do much to please the customer... and they expected a tip!!!!Breakfast was not included (again, the norm in NY), but that was not a problem as there are plenty of lovely and cheap diners around the area where you can have breakfast for under $10 for 2 people. My favourite was located on the corner of 22nd St and 3rd Ave, can't remember the name. Good food, low price and great service. Just don't go to the one just around the corner from the hotel, can't remember name either, but we paid over $25 for breakfast for 2 and we didn't return. The hotel is in a great location, very central, Also, Starbucks is just down the road (well, that's not hard in NY, is it?) and an underground station just 2 minutes away.All in all, the hotel is okay if you only want a base to sleep and shower, but Im not sure I would stay there again, because in my opinion it's not value for money. Maybe they should refurbish the existing rooms first before adding more floors. And that carpet..... eeewww!!!!"
144,1945,"Jan 18 2007	Terrible experience	I just came back from my trip to new york. I am just going save your time and tell you about this hotel: on a freezing new york night their heating system broke and we were given only extra blankets, no room for breakfast, very noisy due to construction, very small rooms, very dirty hall ways, plumming was terrible and while taking shower your feet were in a swap of water.......I switched to another hotel after 2 nights of misery and not only i slept well and comfortable i also saved some money"
145,1945,"Jan 7 2007 	worth a try	I must admit to nearly cancelling my stay after reading the reviews but went through with it with a little trepidation. I had stayed at the hotel previously and whilst the hotel has certainly gone down a little in recent years it is still a good bet.It is true that construction work is ongoing, as some rooms are being refurbished. You might be unfortunate enough to be next to one of these rooms and thenI imagine it would be quite disruptive during the day. We only experienced it through the occasional worker in the lift which was an inconvenience but manageable.The rooms are indeed very small, but from my experience that seems to be the norm in New York. Our room had no view and little natural light from the small window to the rear. Other rooms we saw seemed to be slightly larger and had larger windows onto the street. Our bathroom door did not close and the tv control did not work but these were both put right immediately by the hotel, whose staff were helpful throughout our stay.Things in the hotel's favour are its price which is pretty reasonable if you can get one of the deals available through expedia, or similar. Its location, whilst not notable in itself has many great neighbourhood bars and shops. The Bull's Head nearby is a cool young bar with lively band nights. Molly's is a fantastic classy irish bar and a good place to spend a few hours at the bar, in good hands.There are a number of great diners,in the area for huge tasty breakfasts, the Lyric and Cosmos are particularly good, and the hotel supplies free coffee through a machine in the lobby.The hotel is within good walking range of Chelsea and the East Village and close to the subway, a few blocks along 23rd St.The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom, again tiny, was spotless and had a full-size bath and was supplied with clean towels daily and all the necessary soaps, lotions etc.All in all I would recommend the hotel, albeit with some reservations. If you plan to spend a lot of time in your room I would recommend elsewhere, but then you probably shouldn't be in New York anway if that was the case.I would go back again but would be happier to do so after the current 'improvements' have been made."
146,1945,"Dec 18 2006 	Avoid at all Costs!	I booked this hotel based on the hotels website, this holiday was a present to my son for achieving great results on his GSCE's.Upon arriving at the hotel we noticed scaffolding up, ehich was not mentioned in the description, on entering we were met with dust in the lobby, no ex[planation was given for the works, the staff were not hospitable at all, they did not offer to show us to our room, so we struggled upstairs in the riggety old lift, to our room, which was very tired looking and not at all like the pictures. The bathroom could do with a face lift aswell, but at least the sheets were clean! God Knows why we stayed the only thinfg going in it's favour was the location. On the 3rd night of our stay we heard rustling by the bin in our room and saw a huge RAT! I complained to reception who were not alarmed at all, as if it was something they had heard a million times. This Hotel totally ruined our hoilday, something I had saved up for all year. My advise is avoid at all costs!"
147,1945,"Dec 11 2006 	the hotel is not as bad as this reviews say	I stayed in Marcel hotel 2 weeks ago and i think that it was not as bad as all this reviews say, mayby it's getting old ( the hotel is under renovation), but my room was comfotable we were three and we got enought space, and the room and the bath was very clean. The decoration it's not beautifull, and a litle bit dark, but if u go to NY to see the city i think it's not important if the room it's beautifull or not, the important think is that it's comfortable.The personal of the hotel was very helpfull, we got no problems.Yes the hotel is under renovation, but we didn't notice of any noise or any trouble for being in renovation. And talking about the noise of the street, our room window was in the third street and i sleep all the night and i didnt heard anything. and we where on the second floor."
148,1945,"Dec 2 2006	The Worst Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In! Hated It!	I wish I knew of this website before this hotel was booked for me. Every other bad review matches my experience. Dodgy area of town, the construction STILL going on, the price is way too expensive for what it is worth, the hammering and the noise! The view from my window of a brick wall, the lack of food/no room service/no mini bar. Nothing. I got into the lift one day and a builder came in too - with a toilet. Nice! (NOT!)This hotel is not a good stay. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and there are much better hotels than this. The paint job is dodgy, the walls chipped. Just awful in every way. I was meeting a client here and I was embarrassed about the hotel and the location. It is a crappy hotel that they are trying to make look cool. Stay away!"
149,1945,"Dec 1 2006	A mixed bag mediocre overall	I took a chance on the Marcel when Priceline could not get me a 3 star hotel for $250.00 in late November. I paid $227.00 plus tax at the Marcel. I was hoping that the reviews on TripAdvisor would prove to be overly negative. Unfortunately, most of the negative comments proved to be true. The hotel was under construction, with workers in the lobby and riding the shabby elevator all day. They seem to be working on the upper levels of the building, and there were no hassles from construction on the 4th floor, where I stayed. Reception was friendly and they allowed me to check in early (around noon). A nice doorman came right out to help me with luggage. The worst part of the hotel for me, was the hallway outside the room. It looked like what I would expect in a flophouse--dimly lit, peeling paint, doors leading to spooky vacant rooms. My hotel room was ok. The decor reminded me of something you would see on Trading Spaces--cute modern design, done on the cheap. The striped Roman window shade was already broken. There was no desk in the room, but there was a TV, drawers for clothes, bedside lighting, wireless internet ($9.95 per day extra), and ironing board. The bathroom was fine, with green marble tile and respectable toiletries. The best part of the room was the bed, which was just like the pictures on the internet. There was, as others have noted, a lot of noise from 3rd avenue. I didn't find that a problem for sleeping, since it was mainly just cars driving along, and I could pretend I was hearing the ocean (ok, call me Pollyanna).I didn't bother with the coffee machine in the lobby, since there was a Starbucks nearby. Plenty of nice restaurants around the corner, too.I wish I had gotten a slightly better price (under $200) and then I could have overlooked the demerits more easily. I won't stay there again--it would have been worth $50 or so more for a &quot;normal&quot; hotel."
150,1945,"Nov 27 2006 	Dreadful avoid at all costs!	Shocking hotelRude counter staffTiny, borderline dirty rooms with even tinier, horruble bathroomsOut of the way location for almost anything in NYCWould never go back -- the reviews on the site below show my experience was not isolated, I only wish I read them before I booked!"
151,1945,"Nov 23 2006 	Horrible	This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in even though the rates where very high. I paid 300$ for a single room, the floor was filthy and everything was a little bit shabby. The concierge was not very friendly either. But one night I even had a mouse in my room - worst experience - I did not fo camping!! Never stay here!!"
152,1945,"Nov 12 2006	Dreadful hotel	Quite simply the worst hotel I've ever stayed at and I've travelled extensively. Simply checking in took forever, they didn't recognize the Expedia reservation ID # issued uponmaking the booking. Expedia had to fax the hotel with a confirmation of the booking, the Marcel hadn't received it and wouldn't let us check in without it. You'd think that an e-mail between Expedia and Marcel Hotel would be a more efficient way in which they could communicate something as simple as a booking. Upon calling Expedia they didn't have the correct fax # on file for the hotel, we gave them the correct fax #, but still nothing showed up. Finally I got the front desk clerk to agree to call Expedia, he did so grudgingly telling me that this was my responsibility to take care of not his. Great service, eh ... Finally a conversation was had and he permitted us to check in 45 minutes after arriving at the hotel. We use the elevator that was both extremely slow and tatty in appearance, only to enter corridors that were equally substandard. Upon arriving a our room the door cards do not work and we are forced to return to reception to get new ones issued to us (this occured everytime we left our room!). Finally we get to enter our room which was also disappointing. The tiny room was clean, but the same poor workmanship that appeared in corridors was also apparent here and in the bathroom. The bed was comfortable, but small. The only ice machine in the hotel was four floors away from our room.I witnessed two other guests having similar problems checking in at reception. On both occassions the front desk clark was both rude and unhelpful. They also waited for extended period of time only to be eventually granted permission to go to their rooms. I've no problem with a hotel undertaking renovations, but I do mind paying so much money to witness this occuring first hand. Close up, complete the revnovation and the re-open with a new facelift (it sure needs it!!),"
153,1945,"Oct 27 2006 	The worst hotel I've ever stayed in!	PLEASE take everyone's comments into consideration before booking here! It's a dump and is far overpriced. The truth of the matter is that the hotel is absolutely not what is described to be as profiled in it's website. This hotel IS under construction (and appears to have been for a very long time, from what readers are saying on this site) and it is a major inconvenience to guests, with no remorse from staff and management. What they should have done is close the hotel, renovate, and then re-open. What they are doing is clearly poor management. One of my travel companions suggested that it was like Fawlty Towers, and it was, a total gong show, but there's nothing funny about it when you are paying. Don't stay here. $400/night average? Not worth $50."
154,1945,"Oct 23 2006 	Shabby and too expensive	We have just returned from a weeks stay at the Marcel. From the photo's on the internet we expected a really nice hotel but it did not meet up to our expectations at all! The hotel was shabby and messy. The guy at the desk was very unfriendly and the place was packed with construction workers as they were redoing the place (which was really necessary!). We paid almost EU 1.000,- for a four day stay and that was way too expensive. The room was small and not very comfortable and most of the times we were unable to use the elevator because the construction workers also used it during the day. If we wouldn't have paid the thousand euro's in advance we surely would have left! In fact it was so bad that we are considering to file a complaint with @msterdam hospitality to get a refund!"
155,1945,"Oct 17 2006 	All these reviews are correct!	Wish I had read the reviews before I booked this hotel. There is a 48 hour cancelation policy. The reason for this is when you walk through the lobby it is a total mess (and very hazordous -- nothing preventing or marking the potential three floor drop). The weekend seemed to be a lot better/ put together. The materials used in this hotel were great but the craftmanship of this hotel is awful. Looked like someone's retarded brother-in-law did the construction. And it still is going on. 7 am every weekday. MAKE SURE AND ASK IF THERE IS CONSTUCTION GOING ON OR IF THERE ARE ANY WATER LEAKS FROM THE CEILING -- we saw this the last day of our stay, in the lobby and it wasn't rainning outside). Other than that, our room was fine. The service was okay. The phones worked sometimes and didn't work other times. We stayed there five days/four nights. We loved the neighborhood. If you want to stay in Times Square do not book this hotel. It is truely in a neighborhood. A lot of great Indian, veggie restaurants. A cool, hip scene (for young singles) at night. Very good area. I hope they complete the construction soon but to me, it looks like it is going to go on for years. They should bite the bullet and spend some $$ on doing things the right way. Clean up a little more. Learn how to paint and cock and hang the fixtures straight (and remove the bugs from the ceiling light fixtures). Crazy but that's why it looks so frickin' dirty.Would I stay there again? Hmmm. I'm torn. Nice service but for the price (everyone says it is really cheap but is 279 per night really cheap?) I don't know. I hate chain hotels -- I really wish this one lived up to it's photos on the website. Good luck. I hope this helps.CHECK THE CANCELATION POLICIES BEFORE BOOKING."
156,1945,"Oct 17 2006 	Marcel Hotel -- VERY noisy!!!	We stayed at the Marcel last weekend, as I had a business trip/conference on Friday through Saturday of Columbus Day weekend. The first night (Thursday) my boyfriend and I were greeted by a less than enthusiastic receptionist, and then sent up to our room. When we arrived we were welcomed by a clean and small room with a queen sized bed (though I had requested a king). Everything was fine until we tried to go to sleep....and mind you- we are also from Philadelphia and live right in the city, but we were unprepared for 3rd Avenue being so loud throughout the entire night- it was like there was NO window. I called the front desk to see if we could switch and was hung up on twice. The next morning we were planning to just check out, but when we went to the front desk and told the woman there about our experience, she promptly switched us to a king-sized interior facing room and apologized to us. Her name was Melba, and she was exceptional throughout our next day (we saw her a couple times and checked out with her). The room we switched to was clean, and very very quiet. All in all, my recommendation is to stay away or request an interior room, it will make your stay much more pleasant."
157,1945,"Oct 10 2006 	The worst hotel in New York	We stayed at this hotel based on the excellent description on the website. It was truly awful! It said there was an espresso bar and sushi restaurant in it, this consisted of a Mr. Coffee machine! The whole hotel was tired, grubby and under construction. Workers were all over the hotel, riding (and clogging up) the elevator. The rooms were less than average. The phone did not work and for a time there wasn't any hot water. The hotel manager did not seem to care that we were completely unhappy. Do not stay at this hotel, it is truly awful."
158,1945,"Oct 6 2006 	Horrible Dirty Scared	Hello we stay in september 29,06 and the mini hotel is horrible, we walked many times because the door of the hotel no liked a hotel door. the lobby is dirty, never liked the photos in the internet, never, the elevator is liked that never is clean and dirty and the rugs are dirty never clean the door inside the hotel are broken the room is scared the photos you see in the internet is a fraude not this hotel. When we make a check in, another persons are very angry trying to cancel the reservation because the hotel is a poor house with a carga elevator and scared inside.All the atractions is too, too, too, far from this mini hotel. The price is very,very high for the place its it. We try to stay here the less time possible only 4 hours and make reservation in another hotel in Times Square Zone."
159,1945,Sep 22 2006	Smallest hotel room ive ever been in.	A friend and I stayed at the Marcel Hotel last year and i have to admit it was one of the worse hotels i have ever stayed in.... First of all if its ur first time visting New York do not stay here. Its about 20mins walk to everything. We ended up spending more on Taxi fare than anything else. We booked a twin room and when we arrived they gave us a double room and when we complained they told us there was nothing they could do for us.... The room was only suitable for one person... It was so small u could bearly walk around the bed and the windows didnt close right so not only where we freezing but also the noise of Fire engines and police cars was nearly deafing.... No chance of a good nights sleep after a hard days shopping.... When we were going back to the Airport we decided to book a limo through the Hotel... 5mins after we got in the limo it crashed and the driver hadnt got a word of english so he just got out handed sum money over to the other driver and drove us to the Airport..... A total disaster...Do not Stay at this hotel......
160,1945,Sep 7 2006	Terrible	I had an extremely poor room. Outside of the window was a very load compressor and the view was terrible. There was also no free LAN/WLAN.
161,1945,Aug 1 2006 	Hated the Marcel	There are MAJOR constructions in this hotel. The constructions start at 7h am every morning. I do not recommend it. It's dangerous and full of dirt. The staff was very good though.
162,1945,"Jul 9 2006	Splendid	The Marcel is a wonderful little boutique hotel, perfect if you hate the monstrocsties with 9000 rooms. The staff couldn't be lovelier. They were friendly and very accommodating. The ac in our room could have been colder, but other than that it was perfect. The rooms are decorated with a warm modernity and are very clean. The location is fabulous. Nothing touristy about it. You feel like you're living in NYC. With a two block walk to subways, you can get uptown or downtown in minutes, or enjoy the walk in either direction and find all the wonderful little surprises around each corner that make NYC the most unique place on the planet. I would definitely stay here again. Oh yes, and the price is incredible. The Marcel is undergoing renovations, but this didn't present a problem as far as noise or danger, as I read in some other reviews. Some folks just shouldn't leave home is all I can say about that."
163,1945,"Jun 18 2006	very good for our budget	Having read some of the other reviews of this hotel, prior to our trip in March we were a little apprehensive! But we were not disapointed! the hotel was clean and staff friendly and helpfull! In particular the chamber maids! Who cleaned our room excellently every day, and as there were 3 of us sharing we couldn't help but make a mess. They provided plenty of extra clean towels, glasses and pillows on request. The room were a little small but what do you expect in New York! They were doing some refurbishment but we weren't disturbed by it. The beds were comfy and the bathroom clean and spacious! Our trip cost 489 each including flights so we were impressed with what we got for our money! Great location 10 blocks down from the Empire State and just above Gramercy Park, easy access to subway and loads of places to eat nearby. Only fly in the ointment was a lack of security presence, on our last night 2 friends were on a high floor and they were woken by a terrible violent row in one of the other rooms, they were quite scared and rang down to reception, but no one appeared. Eventually they quieted down, but they said they wouldnt stay their again, but the rest of us would!!!"
164,1945,"Jun 10 2006	Excellent!	I thought the Marcel was lovely. The room was large and spacious, as was the bathroom. Everything was very clean and tidy, and the staff were friendly. I really enjoyed staying in this hotel and would recommend it."
165,1945,"May 4 2006	major construction on top 2 floors	major construction going on top floors. It was so loud one morning, I thought it was an earthquake! (I'm from California). You should check to see when construction will be completed. Room was small, bed was large. I would have preferred a regular queen bed to have a little more walking room. I could only open my suitcase wide open in one corner of the room, which unfortunetly was the exact same place I could put the ironing board (only outlet available). I hated to put my suitcase on the white duvet, but I had no choice.. I stayed here last summer when the staff seemed more interested in looking trendy, but on this stay, they were helpful on several occasions. Marcel is improving; once the construction is completed it will be fine."
166,1945,"May 3 2006	Great for the price	Clean, comfortable, modern.NYC hotels notoriously expensive. (Why???!). Couldn't find anything, anywhere else in the city for the price that came near (we paid just over $100 per night).Doesn't have food or breakfast but free cappucino machine is a great touch!"
167,1945,"May 1 2006 	Marcel reacts unbelievably well	I stayed at the Marcel the same night the entire hotel was evacuated due to weather related issues. The Marcel hotel took it upon their duty to relocate us to another wondeful hotel FREE OF CHARGE. I felt that the staff handled the situation unbelievably well, along with assisting the young infants and the elderly guest out safe and unharmed. I asked the hotel employees how they stayed so calm during such tense moments and the clerk responded, &quot;as a hotel in NYC we are prepared for any situation at any given moment, we have contingency plans for almost any event or situation that comes along.&quot; The bellman was driving the young infants and elderly to other hotels in the area, and thankfully the front desk was able to relocate me to there other lovely hotel &quot;The Bentley&quot;. Unfortunately this happened at 2 am, and if the Marcel reacted to the incident in any other way less than they did I would say that I wouldn't reccomend it. However, the Marcel reacted extremely well and I would recommend this hotel, knowing that when I go to sleep the gentleman downstairs are watching over us, and the safety of others."
168,1945,"Apr 28 2006	Marcel is Terrible and Extremely Unsafe!!!	Last week-end, I stayed at the Marcel with my mother and a friend. I lived in New York for 4 years, and I've stayed at many mid/low priced New York Hotels. NEVER have I had such an AWFUL EXPERIENCE. We were placed in a room where construction was going on over our heads. We were woken by non-stop, Hammering, Drilling and Yelling at 6:00 AM. The next day, we changed rooms, only to be woken by NYC FIREMEN at 2:00 am, because the Marcel was flooding, and the building was being evacuated. The contsruction on the top two floors had not been covered properly, and the entire building flooded from the rain. It was very scary. Water was pouring in everywhere. No managers from the hotel even showed up. We had to pack our things frantically and find another hotel to stay at By OURSLEVES ( along with all the other hotel guests!) at 2:00am. Then, the Marcel had the nerve to charge us anyway, and never apologized. The Marcel is Completely unsafe and should be closed down. Never stay there!!!...... unless you want to see the FDNY in action in the middle of the night!"
169,1945,"Apr 24 2006	Very enjoyable stay	In October 2005 I decided to take my wife to New York for our wedding anniversary, as it was somewhere she had always dreamed of going to. I decided on the Marcel as it is a small hotel, and my wife does not like using lifts. After I had booked, I was a little worried when I read some of the reviews. I need not have worried. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful. The room was clean, the water always hot and the bed very comfortable. We also found it to be ideally situated for walking to most of the sites that we wished to see. We would therefore recommend it to anyone looking for a small reasonably priced hotel."
170,1945,"Apr 11 2006	Modest but felt spoilt	We landed at JFK in subzero (Celcius) temperatures, but found our hotel room well heated and the staff very friendly and helpful. Our linen was changed daily and the bathroom toiletries deserve a special mention. Also liked the range of up-to-date magazines in our room. Extensive library and great cappuchino machine downstairs in the large and inviting foyer. Will stay here again."
171,1945,Mar 28 2006	Loved the Marcel	Excellent service and super clean rooms. Management was very helpful and knowledgable
172,1945,"Mar 27 2006	Clean comfortable Hotel	I stayed at various hotels in NYC and for the price, the Marcel hotel was not bad at all. I loved the boutique style furniture in the room as well as the photographs. I found the rooms very clean and the staff friendly. I will definitely stay there again. The restaurant adjacent to the Hotel was also very good."
173,1945,"Mar 13 2006	A great place to stay	After living in New York for a year I came back for a three night stay to see friends and shop. The Marcel was the perfect hotel for this. I was travelling alone and after expecting a small double bed, I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the room - tons of space and a HUGE bed. It was clean, everything in working order and relatively quiet - it is Manhattan after all!! The staff were very polite and helpful (ordering cabs and passing on messages). It is a great location and for the price - a great deal! A lot better than some of the places I have stayed in NYC. I will definately go and stay there again."
174,1945,"Feb 24 2006	crap	Where do I begin myself and seven members of my family stayed in the marcel for one night on the 24th of November 2005 we had previously been booked into an hotel near Central Park before joining or cruise ship the Queen Mary 2 we had no facilities whatsoever there was no drinks in any of the rooms the windows would not close, and there was no hot Water to shower either at night or in the morning. we was unable to get drinks before 11 o'clock a.m. and had to walk three blocks to a little cafe to get breakfast I would strongly recommend that you gave the marcel a wide berth also my brother had no electricity in his room ."
175,1945,"Feb 10 2006	very comfortable stay	nice place, especially for the price. Our room was spacious and very comfortable (although I was able to see some other rooms and they were rather small, but all were nice) only planned to stay 3 nights and ended up staying 4 because we were so pleased. There is only one elevator so getting in &amp; out can take a few extra minutes, but not a big deal; also there is only one ice machine and it's on the second floor - FYI. capuccino machine was awesome; great bakery and resturaunts within close walking distance, and very easy to get around from this location."
176,1945,"Jan 10 2006	The Marcel is fine!	We got scared after reading the bad reviews on this page about the Marcel Hotel, but were finally very pleased about it. For the price we paid ( 112$ USD per night ), we found the decor above average, the service was discrete and efficient, everyone there was very nice, the room was nice and clean and the coffee machine in the lobby very appreciated. The Third Avenue was a little noisy, but you can't expect it not to be! Don't let yourself be scared away by the other comments, The Marcel is a very nice and affordable place to stay, unless you expect something luxurious."
177,1945,"Jan 8 2006	Very Cold and unable to sleep	We hade four night in the marcel in December and found the room to be very cold as the heating was not working. We had a tempory heater in the room but had to sleep with our clothes on for one night to try and keep warm. The windows do not help as they do not close tight so you get a constant draft through the room. We had a room on the 2nd floor and faced 3rd Avenue, the windows gave no soundproofing the noise from the traffic was very bad, we found it impossible to sleep as the noise went on for most of the night.I dont think we will stay there again as there are better hotels available for the same cost."
178,1945,"Jan 8 2006	Had a nice stay	Was a little worried when read this hotels reviews prior to going and prepared for all sorts of disappiontment however when I arrived this hotel appeared better than what I expected.Reception was fine no problems , Room was on the small side but adequate, didn't spend too much time in there.Window overlooked main road but not noisy in room and great to people/traffic watch ( sad I know but i do come from the english countryside)Room was clean, air con worked well, location of hotel good , walked everywhere easy walk to Empire State, abit furthur to Times square ( did this 4 times in 3 days) and even walked back from Chinatown in 80 degrees heat.However downside to hotel- free coffee machine out of order all the time even though promised to be fixed by hotel staff.Toilet in room overflowed once, fortuatly clean water everywhere.Lift very slow and finally no place to lock or leave vaulables. Decided to leave passports in room in locked case but take everything else with me.Overall hotel was fine for reasonably priced hotel in a large city and I would return."
179,1945,"Jan 1 2006	Great place and value	Although the room was small (but what NYC room is not), the bed and pillows were soft. The bathroom was recently renovated and very nice. Never had a problem with any of the staff and they were friendly and helpful with all of my needs. I would stay again."
180,1945,"Nov 21 2005	NO HEAT NO HOT WATER NO APOLOGIES	This was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. Aside from the heat braking down in the whole hotel overnight and not being fixed for nine hours, we were treated to cold showers and complete rudeness by the staff. Upon checkout, not a single apology was heard. Our booking was done online and not honored. (Requested and paid for a King room, there were some avaible, but they wanted an additional $20 when we got there!) No one came to fix the broken window we reported. We were moved only after we asked and were treated rudely in the process.If you have nothing go wrong during your stay, this might seem like a reasonable place. But that's a huge gamble. I want to know if something DOES go wrong, that the staff knows how to handle it and does so with a little courtesy. There are infintely better places to stay at a good price in NY. Never again."
181,1945,Nov 15 2005	Please read this	Please read this: The Marcel was not a good place to stay. The tolit in my room overflowed one night and it flooded into the entire room in less than 5 minutes. (the room is tiny) They were completely booked that night and were expecting me to just stay in the room that night. The hotel staff was rude and never apologized. I will never stay here again.
182,1945,"Nov 8 2005	Small and noisy but nice staff	I spent 4 nights with my 2 daughters aged 16 and 18. Of course they were charged as adults (the total amount was 1070 USD). Though the hotel knew I came with teenagers, we were given a smoker room (!) on the second floor (as I protested I was told that &quot;no other rooms were available&quot;) and even if the room itself did not smell at cigarette, the beds and pillows were impregnated with nicotine. The room and bathroom were globally clean and the bed very confortable. But the worse was the street noises. The window was absolutly not soundproof (we were right at the corner of 24th str. and 3rd avenue with a telephone booth just under our window) and it was impossible to sleep unless you have earplugs. That's the worst nuisance especially if you want to have a good rest before visiting New-York ! Thanks to all the staff who was absolutly nice, helpful and efficient in any occasion."
183,1945,"Oct 7 2005 	It's fine! Everyone calm down	I stayed at the Marcel for three days and it was more than fine- it was a nice experience. I had read the reviews and I was worried- but when I arrived I got a good room (4th floor) with a lousy view. Who cares? I wasn't there for the view. the room was clean and smelled good and the AC was on (and working). I was was concerned that the bathroom would be bad after reading some of these reviews but it was small but great.The only thing i can imagine is that maybe they have renovated some of the rooms and not others. If people are having horrible experiences and others fantastic, it must be that rooms are different on each floor.All i can say is good luck."
184,1945,"Oct 5 2005	Quite reasonable	I stayed here 2 nights and found it better than I'd prepared myself for. The immediate location is very good, with some nice eating and drinking places nearby, although maybe a bit in between if you want flash shopping or Greenwich Village. The reception looks a little tired and the staff seemed slightly distracted, but were OK. They let me store my bags after checkout. The corridors are a bit dismal, scruffy and depressing. There is only one lift, which can make getting in and out slow.DO NOT let them give you the room on the 2nd floor by the outside A/C unit. After walking in and straight out I was given a front room, which was OK and not too noisy for the 2nd floor. There was enough space and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was perfectly adequate and clean. The worst thing was that there is nowhere at all to hang or store clothes, even to hang up a coat.Overall, I would say it's not particularly stylish as they claim it to be, but its quite adequate if you cant afford to pay more. There is nothing to fear about it, apart from the dreaded room on the 2nd floor...."
185,1945,"Oct 3 2005 	Worst Ever	This Hotel is AWFUL!!!! Stay away! Bed was hard as a rock, the entire hotel was filthy, and the bathroom smelled overpoweringly of mildew. Also, although I prepaid my room online, they sneakily &amp; illegally double charged me without telling me once I checked out of the hotel. Total ripoff and con artists - do not give them your credit card number for any reason!! I now have to fight to get my money back after being charged twice for something that wasn't worth paying for once!Worst ever hotel experience, and I'm calling the better business bureau to report them for illegally charging my card without telling me."
186,1945,"Sep 30 2005	Good Prices but get a street view especially if you smoke !	We stayed there with my boyfriend to show him new York City for a week in April 2005. We are French and the two of us are cogarette smokers. So I asked for a smokers' room. All smokers' romms are situated on the second floor. we were first given a room on the 2nd floor with no view at all and it was very dirty and stinkling with smoke smell. i asked for a change, so I got a room after two days delay that had a street view. it was still a smokers' romm, was more noisy but had windows to &quot;breathe&quot; a little. the rooms were all relatively small. Still, it's a good hotel, conveniently located between downtown and midtown if you like Soho and Nolita but also want to do some shopping in midtown retailers.If you can afford more, go to another hotel."
187,1945,"Sep 26 2005	Clean in a good area and no late-check out fee until 2 PM!	The Marcel is great, especially for those travelling on a budget and making last minute plans. I booked the room Thursday night for Friday night (usually a pricey way to go about seeing NYC) and the room was only $237 with tax thru Nychotels. Granted, $237 isn't cheap, but it was in a great location (everywhere in Manhattan is very accessible and the area seemed very safe). Rooms aren't anything special... if you're expecting The Plaza, that is. I was happy simply because the tub was clean, and the bed was super comfortable and big enough so that my boyfriend wouldn't get upset when I hogged all the sheets (added bonus: bed comes with four fantastic pillows, no having to call the front desk and call for extra). What else do you need when you've got NYC to explore?"
188,1945,"Sep 23 2005	the worst hotel ever	We recently stayed 4 nites at the Marcel Hotel during fashion week. The price was outrageously overpriced; 400/nite. The first room faced the street and was extremely loud. Although the room was a nice size, there was no phone, no room service, no mini bar, only two towels and the remote didn't work for the TV. The air conditioner would wail like a banshee every half hour. We asked to move and got a smaller, but quieter room on the other side of the building. We got in to bed at around midnight and noticed that it was hotter than when we got in to the room. Sure enough, the air conditioner was broken. A guy came to take a look at it and said that it would not be repaired until tomorrow. We once again had to pack up our stuff and move. It was 1pm when we got in to our 3rd room, which was the size of a shoe box. We tripped over each other and finally stumbled in to bed. All nite we could hear the ding of the elevator and the doors opening and closing. Save yourself some misery and never, ever stay here. I called to talk to the manager and he is avoiding me like the plague. These people do not care. Obviously they don't need the business..."
189,1945,"Sep 10 2005	Clean and great location- perfect for the traveller on a budget	For those travelling on a budget, I would definitely recommend the Marcel. My boyfriend and I paid $130 per night (inc. tax)- this is a fantastic rate for Manhattan. I've paid the same in other major cities (mainly London) for filthy, decrepit &quot;hotels&quot; where I literally feared for my safety. Our room was comfortable with a very clean en-suite bathroom. Yes, it was extremely small and our window directly faced a brick wall- but hey, are you really going to spend your time in a city like NYC holed up in your hotel? We also found the service completely adequate- we arrived well before official check in time and were taken straight to our room, and had no problems leaving our baggage at the desk after check-out, until we left NY that evening. For those unfamiliar with the city, let me stress that this is a great location ( I used to work in the area). It's a pleasant, relatively quiet neighbourhood, far from the tourist-trap nightmare that is Times Square and mid-town in general. Wonderful Grammercy Park is nearby, and Union Square and the East Village (loads of restaurants, bars, shops, etc). are within close range; plus, the 23rd Street &quot;6&quot; train stop is only a few blocks away and can take you to the tourist haunts, if you wish. There are some great eateries right there- let me recommend the Sunshine Diner right on third avenue for a quick bite (huge menu and portions), and Capucines on second avenue at 19th street for a classic NYC-Italian meal.If youre on a budget and simply looking to take in NYC from a clean and convenient base, the Marcel is completely acceptable. Those more concerned with amenities such as breakfast, car parking, views, and atmosphere should look elsewhere- and expect to pay for it."
190,1945,"Sep 5 2005	Very Small	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Marcel on Sept 4. The room was very small, I'd say 10x9. As we opened the door, the bed was right there. It was clean and quiet. If the rooms were bigger, it would be a nice hotel."
191,1945,Sep 4 2005	Small but Nice	We stayed at the Marcel's for 3 nights. The rooms are very small but the beds are incredibly comfortable.The staff were very nice and helpful. The hotel is close to the subways so getting around Manhatten was quite easy. The bathrooms are stocked full of nice toiletries and you can get free coffee and capucino in the lobby. I'd recommend using the stairs when getting around the hotel. The elevator is slow and has a funky smell. Ice was always available. I would stay at the Marcel's again but only if we were 2 people sharing the room. We had my husband's teenage daughter with us so it got real crowded.
192,1945,"Aug 4 2005 	4 Stars?? I think not	Wasn't the WORST place you could stay in NYC, but no where near the best either. This hotel is also listed as a 4 star on many travel sites, but I can't understand why? This makes me wonder about the rating system in general. The rooms are small (not the smallest you'll get in NYC, but small). Lighting is really bad, gives the room a dark, closed in feeling. The room was fairly clean, although the bathroom could have been cleaner. I just expected more from this hotel, but should have known better.I was also worried about the posts of not having a reservation once I got there. I did go check in early (12pm), and didn't have a problem thankfully.If you want a hotel that's about the same price, stay at the Hudson. The Hudson has smaller rooms, but the decor is much better, along with the atmosphere."
193,1945,"Aug 2 2005	Marcel More So!	We were two Chicago girls in the Big Apple for a comedy festival but we were daunted by the reviews wed read below! The price was right ($127-$157 via their reservation line), but would the Marcel really turn out to be a dump? It was fine! There were a couple of glitches, but [insert Yiddish grandma voice here] for such a price, who could complain?The dcor might best be described as Ikea Wannabe: its a budget hotel, but at least they try for a boutique-hotel look. Our room (501) was tiny, better for a single traveler, but we did catch a peek at some larger rooms, which you might be able to request. No desk, no view other than a pigeon-stained sill and no soap dish in the bathtub. Just one grandfatherly elevator and crackly phone reception.But it was clean, quiet, came with a couple of toiletries, delicious push-button cappuccino in the lobby (but not in the mornings), the CD player in the alarm clock played our mix CD, and the mattress and pillows were firm. The comforter comes with a duvet cover, which keeps you from getting creeped out by Other Peoples Bedding, and when the front desk staff wasnt indifferent (no help finding a nail salon), they were gracious (thanks for the wine key). Best of all, the window shade really kept out the daylight so we could sleep off our nights out on the town!"
194,1945,"Jun 14 2005	Disgusting	I made a booking through a reputable hotel discount site for 7 nights for two members of my family. The booking was made last year at a rate of $88.00 per night, Upon arrival at the hotel they were advised that there were no rooms available and they were to be moved around the corner. (mind you people were checking in after we were advised they were full). This hotel was a filthy ansd unsafe and clearly not even worth $88.00 per night. They were advised by a staff member that this happens all the time to bookings made through the net. And surprise, surprise, the website concerned was not interested at all, but they did apologise for my inconvenience, Big Deal. As this is not the first complaint of this type, and discount hotel sites are aware of this happening, this hotel should be deleted from their databases."
195,1945,"Jun 9 2005	Don't even THINK about staying here	How ANYONE could review this with 5 stars I don't know. I booked through Hotels so I was absolutely screwed. Room was 12 x 12 with no desk and no internet despite the fact that they insisted that there WAS internet. Rude and unprofessional staff. Place was so BAD that despite my prepayment through hotels.com, and the fact that I arrived at 11PM, I left at midnight to check into a decent and REAL hotel. That's how bad this place is. By the way, my rate on hotelcom, was $280 or so.So, take my advice, do evemn THINK about staying at this place, even if it was for FREE. I'm 57 years old and a businessman. I've NEVER had an experience like this."
196,1945,"Jun 1 2005	Yet again no room	I too booked the Marcel in April of this year and paid up front with Expedia. I knew I would be ariving late so I faxed the hotel and took the confirmation slip with me. Ariving at the hotel about midnight we were told there were no rooms available but they would arange for us to stay in a hotel round the corner. This was the most awful place you could ever imagine to stay in, the type of hotel where you sleep on all your valuables and the ceiling tiles, it would seem were optional. 5 seconds was all that was needed to realise that we stood a better chance on the streets of NY with our suitcases than in that place. To cut a long story short we found another hotel which the Marcel did reimburse us for no problems but after a long flight do you really want to chance this hapening to you, I think not, there are plenty more to choose from."
197,1945,"May 18 2005	Good hotel for the price	This is a good hotel for the money. We managed to get the hotel for 70 a night and for that price in New York it was superb. The location is perfect. The shops and bars of Greenwich and the East Village are an easy walk away (14 blocks) as is the Empire State building. The rooms are tiny but contain everything you need including cable tv and a cd player. Don't let the size of the rooms put you off though, they look great. The bathroom was small but clean and nicely designed. The bed linen was perfect and changed daily. The staff were very helpful and polite and the limo service to the airport for our departure was good value for money ($10 more than a taxi) and convenient. The hotel looks as good as it does in the pictures on the internet. If I had to fault the hotel it would be the size of the rooms, our room really was very small but if you're reading this review the chances are you're looking for value for money which the Marcel certainly is. We'll definitely stay there again."
198,1945,"May 2 2005 	Would have loved a hot shower...	We needed this hotel to be near a medical conference at NYU. In that way it was great, just a few blocks up the street. Lots of nice shops, delis, etc in the area. The bed was delicious, reminded me of European hotel beds with the big down quilt. Nice to have a safe in the room, too.BUT - we arrived Friday afternoon and the first hot water was Sunday morning. Staff grudgingly said the repairman was on the way and we might have believed them except for the guy checking out who had been there for three days beforehand and had NO HOT WATER.You can't get ice, you have to ask for it. Just what I wanted - tipping for ice in a budget hotel.Bathroom's bizarre, and we nearly fell every time we walked out of the bathroom because the floor tilted so badly.Also, when the advert said &quot;parking,&quot; we weren't ready to pay nearly $70 for the lot across the street. That's from Fri. nite to Sun. morning. And an extra charge for having an Envoy. sigh. At least the car was safe. I will look for another hotel next time, even if it means being farther away."
199,1945,"Apr 21 2005	very nice and worth every penny	we booked the hotel and flights with onlinetravel and found this hotel to be in a great location to access midtown (empire state etc) and down town (ground zero, wall street). The hotel lobby was modern with some good deco and to boast they supplied you with an unlimited supply of 24 hr FREE coffee!!! ( thats why the city never sleeps). I think myself and my brother almost drank them dry! The room was clean and cleaned each day, clean towels daily, and hoovered daily as i always got crumbs on the floor from my subway or deli sandwich!! We stopped on the fourth floor viewing third avenue noisy but thats part of new york which added to the charm. The staff were all very friendly holding the door for you every time you left or entered the building. At one point, my key card was not opening the door and all i had to do was go to reception and they sorted it straight away without any hassle. The city itself was amazing and once again worth every penny. There are forty nine dollar two day tours that you can hop on and off at any time or you can stay on the full circle which roughly takes two hours. Empire state costs 13 dollars to go to the top but you can pay an extra six to get an audio tour aswell which i would suggest to anyone. something that i only found out just before i was leaving and did not have time to do is that they do a free ferry to Staten island and back at the docks near battery park. The ferry to liberty island and ellis island costs 10 dollars but unfortunately you can no longer go to the top since 9/11.just want to say hi to heather who i left at home who i missed lots on my trip (arr)"
200,1945,"Apr 17 2005	It was fine!	I was worried about this hotel after reading some of the reviews. The Marcell was fine. It was clean, functional and everything was as advertised. However the rooms were much smaller than we expected from the photos as was the foyer. The hotel was an excellent base for exploring this amazing city and the staff were curtious and helpful.Our tips - use the stairs..............waiting for the lift wastes shopping time and eat at Andreas (just round the corner, 307 3rd Ave at 23 St) it was lovely."
201,1945,"Apr 15 2005	terrible business	My husband and I booked a room through Expedia, called twice to confirm our reservation and reiterate we would have a late check-in. We arrive at the hotel at 2 in the morning, they had no room for us. We had already paid in full through Expedia. In 2004 a friend booked a room there and had EXACTLY the same thing happen. Don't book a room at this hotel!!!"
202,1945,"Apr 14 2005 	Prepaid Reservation Yet Room Given Away Apathetic Staff	On the morning of my scheduled arrival, 4/9/05, at the Marcel Hotel in NY, I called the hotel and was able to confirm my reservation with them for 3 nights, which I had made through expedia. When I arrived at the hotel to check in just a few hours later, I was told by a woman named Albina FD, behind the front desk, that they were &quot;having some problems with the rooms upstairs.&quot; I was then told that I would be moved to another hotel approximately 30 blocks away from this hotel. I spoke with both the manager and Albina. I expressed my overall disbelief at such an unacceptable situation. I told them that the reservation was pre-paid, asked them again how a hotel room could disappear within the span of a few hours, and then demanded that I receive all of my money back. They assured me that I would receive a full refund. This refund has not yet appeared on my credit card statement and I am becoming anxious about time lapsing as there is still an absence of this refund on my statement. So, not only was I robbed of accommodations, having to find another place to stay downtown within the span of an hour, but I am now being inconvenienced by also having to follow up on the refund to my credit card, something I would expect to occur as the most fundamental form of customer service from any reputable company. This ultimately disrupted an invaluable meeting of my own, both with a family member, and then later, a business partner. I am already dismayed at having to go to such great lengths to get money back for a service that I never received. So far, I have been robbed of over $600.00, by either Expedia or the Marcel Hotel. I don't know who is ultimately responsible at this point, but as Expedia's name is on my credit card as the payee, I shall first pursue this refund through Expedia.I am numbed by the apathy by both parties involved thus far, and by the underhanded way in which these companies have conducted business."
203,1945,"Apr 1 2005 	Loved it	This hotel is really great, an excellent value and good clean room. Staff was very accomodating to my needs and listened to every request I had. Enjoyed my sleep there in a very comfortable bed."
204,1945,"Mar 22 2005	Some don't like it hot	First impressions were good with a neatly dressed door guy, pleasant reception staff, and a tidy lobby.The room was boiling hot with constant heat that couldn't be adjusted. On complaining to the front desk we were told it was due to health and safety issues and that the hotel had to be kept to a certain temperature. I thought that was a neat twist on ' it's broken' The only way to cool it down was to open the window which due to traffic noise had to be shut at night.The bed was very comfy, the one chair was stained. The TV was in a wooden cupboard and angled so you had to sit on the right side of the bed or else you couldn't see the screen. There was no light switch for the main light by the bed, it had to be turned off at the doorThe bathroom was adequate, but lacked space to put your toiletries, the only shelf had the usual hotel freebies on it.There was only one lift for the 8 floors and you shared it with the hotel staff.A plus point was the very drinkable coffee available 24 hours a day in the lounge.From the reviews posted, the rooms in this hotel are not of a consistent standard and I would not recommend it."
205,1945,"Mar 21 2005	Very Happy	I loved this place,i have just recently stayed at this place in New York City for 6 nights and before arriving to the hotel was not really sure what to expect when thinking of some reviews read on the tripadviser,upon arriving,first thing i noticed it seemed to be a quite place which it really was,the staff was very helpful,always responded on time if any requests,and made arrangements for transportation to the airport,arrangements to visit statue of liberty,restaurant reservation and almost everything.I would again like to thank the young lady in the morning and the young man in the afternoon who tirelessly worked hard for their guests.I felt bad the other day when i saw a man yelling at the young lady regarding his reservation his 3-rd party agency messed.Anyway,i did enjoy the stay,very quite place,small cozy rooms.Will definitely be back.TIP:From now on i am going to ignore some reviews because most of these bad ones from people who expect TRUMP International for $30 a night."
206,1945,Mar 19 2005	Disappointed	I guess you don't expect much for $200 in NYC but even at that the Marcel was a disappointment. The room was tiny and cave-like and the heat / AC had one setting: &quot;blast furnace&quot;. To be comfortable we had to leave a window open but that meant the risk of allowing ledge roosting pigeons to enter. Worse was the front desk service. We got the run around on making shuttle arrangements and wound up having to take a car service to Newark Airport.
207,1945,"Mar 7 2005	Avoid this hotel	What do you get for $200 in New York City? Not much, judging from my recent stay at the Marcel Hotel where I calculated it cost me $50 for each hour of sleep I managed to get. The room was very small, very dark and ugly beyond belief in shades of prison grey-green and carpeted in German-style Art Deco brown in various patterns which make it look as it has been pieced together from off-cuts. The hotel is very noisy - every time anyone opens or shuts a door it reverberates through the corridor making sleep impossible. I was also disturbed by guests in the room opposite to mine having a noisy party with the door open and later woken by someone shouting obscenities and threats in the corridor. The front desk did solve this problem when I called down to tell them about it. There are no comforts at all, the TV is tiny, the bathroom cramped with thin towels and cheap shampoo, no coffee, no water, no room service, no fitness facilities. The room is clean and the check-in staff efficient."
208,1945,"Jan 23 2005	This hotel is perfectly fine	My husband and I stayed here for a week in mid January and I really found it fine. Our first room was near the emergency stairs and was a little loud as I am a very light sleeper, I mentioned this to the man who checked us in and he moved us with no problems to a different room towards the back of the hotel. The view wasn't great back there, but the room was clean, the shower FANTASTIC and the bed very comfy.It's pretty well placed for me as I don't spend all my time up in midtown, it's within walking distance of the East Village, Union Square and the Empire State Building. There's good bars on the nearest Avenue, a comedy club on the same road and the Lyric diner is a great close by place for breakfast if you're a little low on funds.This hotel is not a four or five star hotel, it is ??????60 a night in Manhatten job, it's not going to be perfect, but i found the staff helpfull and friendly and all the things I need, local info, cab booking, late check in, luggage holding, laundry service ect ect, were all present and correct.Also, when we left they called us a car service cab, a nice big Lincon, which cost $50 to JFK including tolls, and if you've ever had to get a yellow cab out there you'll know how usefull that is.Oh, and there is no way this hotel is dirty, it simply isn't, that's not up for discussion."
209,1945,"Jan 18 2005	Never never book this	Booked a room over the internet. Called day of travel to confirm the room and request late checkin and was told that all was fine. When we arrived late at night our room had been given away. Furthermore, the hotel lobby looked terrible compared with the photos. I hate to imagine what the rooms were like. It was dirty the man behind the desk was rude. I would only suggest you book this place for your worst enemy"
210,1945,"Jan 13 2005	Not bad	We satayed here over the xmas weekend 2004Unlike other reviews we did not have great problems. the hotel is a budget hotel - perhaps not a 3 star but not bad. When we arrived we got stuck in the lift. After having problems at the airport with the arrival time and problems with luggage this was the last thing we needed. There were 7 people in the lift and when we got out we were told that there were too mabny people in their there should be only 4 - which was supririsng as there was no sign to this affect. The frondt desk behaved like this was a noraml occurance. All trips in the lift were fine and there were more than 4 people in thereWhen we checked in they only had it down for 2 people although I booked for 3. We got a extra bed and towels quite promptly There was the continental breakfast + coffee in the lobby which was good. The linen was clean We also got a car called for us on our last day which was nice.All in all not a bad experience. The area was so quiet I think I would have prefered to stay in times square or on the upper west side where I have stayed previously.I wander those who say it was noisy what days they were staying. Maybe as it was Xmas weekend but the area looked like a residential area - as if it was the outskirts of the busy areas - Times Square, Macey's etcThe staff were pleasant I would say that is worth staying again"
211,1945,"Jan 13 2005	A great base for a very happy week	We booked The Marcel through last minute .com as part of a flight and hotel package recognising it would be cheap and cheerful. The 1st room we were given after checking in was on the 2nd floor, we took one look at it and point blank refused to stay in it (Think the hotel room Tom Hanks stayed in the movie 'Big'!) The guy on reception was very accomodating and moved us immediately to a room on the 6th floor, which whilst being relatively small was perfectly formed with a great view of the Empire State Building. All room amenities functioned perfectly, the bed was exceedingly comfortable, and the Bathroom was fine.Location-wise the hotel is in a good area, with most attractions being walking distance, Greenwich, Union Square etc... are also accessible by foot, and the subway is nearby for those attractions further afield. Surrounding areas are good for food and bars, the nearby Hairy Monk Irish bar has to get a special mention for friendly staff and a decent pint!We had a great week in NY and couldn't really find much at fault with the Marcel"
212,1945,"Jan 12 2005	Bad times at the Marcel	I made reservations by phone and internet for two separate occasions and both times my reservations were &quot;invalid&quot; when I arrived at the hotel. Both times, the desk manager did little in the way of helping us locate another hotel, claiming the mixup was unavoidable. The second time it happened, they sent us to a hotel that required a 20 minute cab ride, the cost of which did in no way make up for the &quot;good deal&quot; they supposedly gave us. The two times I did stay at the Marcel with no reservation problems, the person handing out beverages in the breakfast &quot;dining&quot; room, arbitrarily decided who could get more than one beverage at a time. Don't say you weren't warned!"
213,1945,"Jan 10 2005	Positive review good bargain hotel for NYC	I read the other reviews posted here and wanted to share my positive experience. This is a budget hotel, the rooms are smaller than average but clean and the bed was very comfortable. Duvet covers on the bed were clean (white!) and the sheets and towels smelled fresh and were also clean and white. The staff was courteous and helpful and even called a town car for us on our day of departure. They gladly let us store our bags for the remainder of our last day there without a problem.Two things were a problem, the heat in the room was impossible to regulate. We slept with the window open (in January), and the elevator could use some work. It was very slow.Sightseers, shopping spree-ers and generaly anyone looking for a hotel to just sleep and shower in would do good here. Business travelers would do well elsewhere as the rooms are not business friendly. I did not hear any noises from any bars or restaurants nearby as other reviews stated, even with the wondow open the whole stay. I inquired at the front desk about a bar and they did not have one so perhaps the motel is on an upswing, or perhaps I just picked a good weekend to stay, but I felt comfortable."
214,1945,"Dec 23 2004	Don't Do It!	My best girlfriend and I stayed there for 3 nights. It was the most horrible hotel room we had every seen. We were expecting a trendy comfortable room near all the attractions, and what we were left with were bags under our eyes. The room was constantly dark, we actually had to take the lamp shades off to see what we were wearing. Open the window shade you say? It looked right into another couples' room. The bed was creaky and uncomfortable, and in the morning, our saving grace was the luxury breakfast of warm orange juice and stale bagels. It is close to alot of attractions, but just not worth the hassle of an uncomfortable bed and smelly, dark rooms. If you don't expect much from the service (they took 2 hours to bring us additional towels), and a not so clean atmosphere, come to this hotel."
215,1945,"Dec 22 2004	Don't stay here if you need to sleep!	I have stayed at the Marcel several times over the years since it was refurbished. When I first stayed there it was a relatively quiet (given the location) and undiscovered hotel offering good rates. The upper floors had just been refurbished and although some of the rooms are small they were all furnished to a high standard, with good bathrooms. Since then however I have noticed a marked decline in standards, to the extent that I will no longer stay there. The main problem is the bar and nightclub that operates on the ground floor and basement of the hotel. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights it's impossible to sleep because of the constant thump thump of the music. One night I stayed there the music continued until 3am, and I had to get up at 5am to catch a flight home. On subsequent stays I requested a room on higher floors but even then there's the noise made by clubbers leaving the hotel in the early hours, the taxis and cars that pick them up, and accompanying shrieking and shouting. I've also noticed that the hotel, which was originally marketed as an upmarket business hotel, is now favoured by teenagers and as a result there was a lot of nocturnal thumping, banging doors and running about. On my last stay I ended up going to stay with some friends nearby just to get a decent night's sleep! This is for me the main issue with the hotel, that the hotel management are trying to run a nightclub at the same time as presenting the hotel as a superior destination for business travellers, which it isn't. There's also the problem that there's only one v-e-r-y slow lift, so you can end up waiting up to ten minutes just to leave the hotel; the staff are friendly enough by New York standards but things often seem disorganised, and the bar doubles as the breakfast room so looks pretty shabby and worse for wear the mornings after the nights before.My recommendation would be: great if you're under 20 and not looking to sleep, but if you are older and want a decent night's sleep, stay elsewhere."
216,1945,"Nov 23 2004	Don't stay at the Marcel	Stayed at the Marcel for 1 night a month ago. Was quite happy to check out the following morning. And even happier that I had followed the gut feeling I had got from other TripAdvisor users and cancelled the other 6 nights I had booked at first. The room we got was small and very dark - window facing a brick wall - and the 'design' was nowhere to be found. Can't complain on the service as we really didn't get any. All in all, you can do a lot better in NYC - even in the same area as the Marcel. I can truly recommend the Park South Hotel - very nice rooms, great breakfast, excellent service and location (close to the no 6 subway line)."
217,1945,"Nov 18 2004	Great Weekend	Getting a hotel for the marathon weekend was always going to be difficult and after reading the reviews I was worried about staying at The Marcel however the accommodation was fine for what we required. We were hardly in the place, who wants to lounge around a hotel when you have the City to explore; coffee and breakfast were provided but why use it when you can have a mountain of food and re-fills in the dinners close by? At least you had the option.....The staff were friendly and helpful when getting cabs and with luggage. No problems with the water temperature. Rooms were on the small side but for the location what do you expect?This hotel isn't the best in Manhattan but for a short break and at a reasonable price compared to the other hotels for that weekend, I'd go back."
218,1945,"Oct 27 2004	not bad but there are better values available	My wife and I recently stayed at the Marcel for four nights. I had read other reviews here, both good and bad, and remained optimistic for our stay. Too bad, we should have rebooked our stay at another property.On our first day we arrived early and the hotel stowed our bags until check-in. When we returned we were checked into room 312. Our room was very small (15 feet by 15 feet) and had a queen bed with one small closet, a small bathroom, and one window. We immediately noticed the room was hot, stuffy, and dry. The room had a hvac unit under the window, and we turned on the AC. The AC unit got cold but it's fan did not blow air into the room. Even with the window open it was impossible to get a draft going. When we called the front desk they were unsympathetic and said there was nothing they could do. Eventually the room cooled off, but it was still stuffy and dry. We woke up every morning with dry sinuses and throats.The room was clean, but in need of repairs. There were some gashes in the wallpaper and the roman shade was frayed on the edges and difficult to operate. The lighting in the room was dim, and there was no workspace area. The bed was comfortable, the sheets and towels clean, and the bathroom's water pressure was good and the water temperature was hot. There is plenty of audible street noise in the room, but it's New York, what do you expect?We tried the coffee machine in the lobby and it was awful. It is not maintained regularly and operates poorly. There is a Starbuck's one block away and well worth the walk. The hotel's breakfast of bagels and juice are average. They also provide copies of the Financial Times each morning in the lobby.Overall, this hotel should be two stars. It is trying to be a boutique hotel when it is clearly a budget hotel and an overpriced one at that. Any photos on the internet have clearly undergone some photoshop magic. My guess is that some rooms fair better than others, if you are willing to take that chance. We did not complain too much because it was a business trip and the room was prepaid. However, we would not stay here again as there are much better properties to stay at in the same price range or less (Habitat NYC, On The Ave, and the Roger Williams to name a few)."
219,1945,"Oct 20 2004	Great value!	We stayed at the Marcel for eight days and had a very good experience. Yes, things are getting worn and frayed in this always booked, heavily travelled hotel (and whoever laid the carpet/hung the wallpaper was inept) but overall everything was just fine and most importantly CLEAN. Please keep in mind that this is a budget hotel, not the Soho Grand. For the price, it offers a lot more value than other hotels I've stayed at in the area. The employees were extremely helpful and prompt, the view out our 7th floor windows was great, and the bed was so comfortable it was hard to get out of it in the morning. We will stay here again."
220,1945,"Oct 13 2004	Until day 7 it was good!!	Our stay was generally satisfactory until day7 when $770 worth of cash and travellers cheques had been taken from our room!!!! This hotel had no safety deposit boxes or room safes which i find incredible for a hotel in a chain of 4 in 2004!!! Horay to the person that went into our room as they obviously needed it more than i did, &quot;you live and learn&quot; as they say but we went on to have the most enjoyable day of our hols despite this incident (the new york police dept is certainly an experience) So would i advise this hotel....... NO trust is not too much to ask. A reputation should be built upon this, although this hotel has a good location i cannot advise anyone to stay here!"
221,1945,"Oct 12 2004	Marcel great for us!	The one thing I can tell from these reviews is that the Marcel must be very inconsistant. However, for my family (3 rooms for 2 nights), it was great! The staff were helpful and nice and the accommodations were pleasant. To be honest, the rooms didn't seem exceptionally small to me for a NYC hotel in this price range. I can say that rooms 407, 803, and 804 were very nice. The air conditioning (something some reviews complained about) was just fine. So, perhaps you can request one of these rooms and be satisfied."
222,1945,"Oct 10 2004	Great Hotel	september 23th till october the 3th of 2004 was our 10 days in The Marcel hotel.We had from the day that we arrived, till the day we left, a very good experience in that hotel.We knew that the rooms where small and with 3 adults it was a bit small but we could managed, you can't expect much for the money we paid for the rooms....When we arrived some one directly came to help us out of our taxi, at the desk we got a nice reception from the staff and we got without problem our cards(keys) to go upstairs.As we enter the room, put the light on and we saw a (small) room with 2 double beds and a tv and a gameconsole for the kids( you have to pay for these games and films) for 3 adults it's enough space but when you use that room for 4 adults it's way too small then, but good for 3 people (adults) that's for sure.The room are cleaned every day and the service to guest is superb...nice and friendly staff.The hall downstairs is in the morning a breakfast hall where you can toast your bagels with cream cheese and jam and get fresh coffee and orangejuice every morning.There is also a expresso machine where you can get as much coffee as you can drink in many ways.But you must now how to handle the machine, sometimes the coffeebeans won't go down( so do as the man who serves breakfast in the morning,make sure that you losing up the beans with the plastic knife in the coffee container on top of the machine....LOL) as the machine grinds it's own coffee makes it in expresso or capuchino or what ever you want to make......Everything went well with our stay, but of course there where some customers, who did not get what they bargained for(budget hotel!)...but this hotel has 97 room and sometimes it can go wrong....but in our case everything went smooth and pleasant....Only a tip for those who stay there with 3 adults make sure you get enough towels and toilet paper!!!!!This hotel can't go wrong for the money I paid for and the area it was in!!!!!!!!!!Great area to eat and drink!"
223,1945,"Oct 3 2004	Beware!!	I have been to New York many times and this was by far the absolute worse hotel I had ever stayed in. What made it even worse was this was the first time I had brought my children with me. I really wanted them to have a wonderful time, but this hotel just ruined everything. I always read the reviews before I stay soemwhere and when I read the ones already published I was a bit wearly. The latest ones did however portray a picture of things that may hvae been unpleaseant in the past have been fixed. WRONG!! The airconditioning in our room never worked and when I called the front desk about it they could have cared less. The toilet in the room constantly backed up and again the staff seemed to not care. If they knew I was staying an entire week (7 days) why did they put me in a room where nothing worked. I will NEVER stay here again and I suggest none else does either."
224,1945,Sep 21 2004	Good experience for a long weekend.	My sister and I stayed for a 3 day weekend. We loved the location of Marcel. The staff was very friendly and accomodating on every level. The bagels and juice were quite good too. The only complaint we would have is the lack of hot water. It was hard to turn the knob far enough to make it hot. And the hot water knob on the sink kept popping off. The walls are thin but it's New York City. You are going to hear noise 24/7. The beds were very comfortable.
225,1945,"Sep 13 2004	Underwhelming	This place trys to be a hip, unique boutique NYC hotel, but it's pretty rough around the edges...i.e. not that clean and a bit tattered. The decor reminded me of Ikea-cheap. The service was indifferent, not even a smile when you walk in the entrance. And don't expect anything beyond &quot;no frills&quot; ameneties. The room was what I called &quot;The Cave&quot;. It was TINY and the only window was down this small hallway that served no purpose and faced another hotel room window in the back of the hotel which meant a depressing, dark and dreary room, not to mention the fear that your neighbor could be looking into the room if your shade was up. My husband arrived a few days before I did and had I been the first to arrive I would have asked for a different room considering he was staying for 9 nights, but he was tired and isn't as picky as I am. The bathroom was nice and clean but your arm hit the toliet paper dispenser everytime you sat on the loo because it was such a small bathroom. We had the A/C on HIGH the entire time just to keep the temp comfortable, even though it was not that hot outside. The location of the hotel is fine and pretty centrally located. But, for the same range price, you can find better places in New York."
226,1945,"Sep 10 2004	Good experience	The Marcel was a nice, clean hotel with funky decor. Our room was nice and the bed was really comfortable. The air conditioning seemed a bit noisy at first but you get used to it and at least it drowns out the noise of Third Ave. The only problem we encountered was the lack of hot water in the hotel. We were there for a week and, for two of those days, we had no hot water (nor did the rest of the hotel). The reception staff weren't very sympathetic and kept saying the problem would be fixed 'in an hour' which was a complete lie. It was really hot in NY and it wasn't pleasant to have to spend a day sightseeing and then go on a long-haul flight without having had a shower..."
227,1945,"Aug 30 2004	Don't expect to much and it'll be great	When we arrived, we needed to present a credit card. We don't have one, so we had to pay a $200 warrant. It was refunded without any problem after a friend helped us out.We had no problems with the staff, the AC worked fine and the rooms were very clean. The toilet didn't flush properly. TV had about 20 channels, including NBC, CBS, FOX, ABC,... and a Nintendo, but I guess you'll have to pay for that. You can also order a recent movie at your TV. Nice shower, low bath, very nice bed. We had a lot of noise from 3rd Avenue but hey, this is NYC. It didn't bother us.If your looking for a nice place to rest your head: this is it. Don't stay here if you're looking for much more."
228,1945,"Aug 17 2004	Terrible experience	We had a voucher for 3 persons (2 adults, 1 child). When we arrived they were quite surprised to see The room they offered us had one bed! They said that they'll put in a bed for the child, but there was no space in the room for that bed. We didn't accept it and got offered a room with two beds. The room was located towards the backyard and was dark because the window was covered. Outside the window there was a pump noising 24hrs. The electronic keys never worked. At least not for our room but - as we were told - for the room next to ours. The included breakfast was ok and the italian coffee machine was marvelous."
229,1945,"Aug 9 2004	Horrible experience!!!	I went to NYC for a long weekend escape (4 days) and slept in a different bed the 3 nights we stayed at The Marcel. The first day we got in, my husband and I noticed that the room felt a little humid but we thought: &quot;hey, no problem maybe in a few hours it'll get cool, we just got here!&quot; A few hours turned into NEVER and we called to have our air conditioner fixed. They came, they saw, they didn't fix and we were given an &quot;upgrade&quot; to another room, which was even worst than the one before. We were offered to be moved to another hotel since we were so dissatissfied but we had to wait...there were no rooms available. It was already 1 o'clock AM, so we decided to sleep in our little oven and deal with the problem in the morning. I called the front desk to verify if we were going to be moved and they had no idea what I was talking about. Once again, we were offered an &quot;upgrade&quot; to another room and guess what??? That one didnt have any air conditioner either. Surprise, surprise!!!! I went down to the front desk with my card key collection and explained my situation...they really didn't care. And so, we were given a &quot;downgrade&quot;...yes, we went from the penthouse to a second floor, full size bed, smoking room, which had an air conditioner that worked for 4 minutes every 2 hours. It was our last night and decided to give up. It was cooler outside than in the hotel, so we spent all of our time exploring NYC and went to the hotel to take a bath and sleep as little as we could. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone. It ruined my little vacation."
230,1945,"Aug 9 2004	Excellent	I was kind of nervous to see what the hotel was like since this was the first time that I had been to NY, but this hotel was excellent. The rooms were small, but what do you expect in Manhattan. They were very clean. The hotel in general was very clean. The beds were sooooooo comfortable. They offer a free continental breakfast which is hard to come by in New York, and it is close to the 6 train. The only problem that I had was the water pressure sucked and the staff could have been happier, but other than that i would stay there again."
231,1945,"Jul 26 2004	Terrible experience	We came to NY with a friend at about 9 pm. I had a reservation for 1 double room with 2 double beds. Luckily, I had a printout confirming our prepaid reservation. Upon arrival at the hotel the clerk at the reception desk informed us that they did not have any rooms left! I showed him the printout, and he told me that he did not care too much, and that they did not have any rooms left. It was the first time in my very extensive experience with hotels that a clerk could be either so rude, or so blatantly unhelpful. They did not honor the reservation, but instead sent us to a different hotel (Bentley) belonging to the same chain. We did not receive any apologies, and at the other hotel the staff were equally unpleasant. I know that the same owners have several hotels around NY, and I would like to warn anyone from staying at any of their hotels! The service is non-existent, and the staff are out-right rude. As for hotel Bentley, we also did not like the location of the hotel. It is far from anywhere you might want to go, and the area goes dead after 8 pm which is very unusual for NY. Be ware of hotels Bentley and The Marcel!"
232,1945,"Jul 22 2004	Would stay for business not for pleasure	The hotel looks far nicer and considerably more spacious when looking on Expedia. The front desk was friendly and helpful; unfortunately, the hotel furnishings (rooms and lobby included) remind me of worn IKEA furniture, which while modern, doesn't necessary make me want to stay there again. Other little things I noticed were stained drapes in my room as well as a bathroom air freshener (yes, those pastel disks that are in public bathrooms) stuck to the wall of the elevator. Hotel needs a facelift, but it's certainly cheap. I would stay there for business (to stay at a low cost hotel) if I had to, but would not choose this hotel for a leisure visit."
233,1945,"Jun 28 2004	Efficient clean cheap and quiet with a comfortable bed.	We had room 511. EXCELLENT room for a couple. Quiet, clean, efficient. Don't expect to be waited on hand &amp; foot, but do expect quick check-in and check-out, as well as courteous staff. Bed was so comfortable, we over slept. Room is small, but well designed use of space. No ESPN, though. Definitely going back."
234,1945,"Apr 12 2004	Good for the price	We stayed at the Marcel for a week in April, and had been a little apprehensive before arriving because of some of the reviews on this site. So how does it compare with what contributors have said? It is true that the hotel could do with some remodelling - it looks like it underwent a makeover a few years back and hasn't been touched since. However, if this happened, I'm sure the room prices would rocket. What you do get is an adequate-sized room (in our case with a pleasingly large and comfortable bed), a great location (very handy for midtown and downtown and with good subway links), a complimentary breakfast (with unlimited tasty bagels), as well as efficient and friendly staff. If you want all this on a moderate budget, then go for it. You will find far worse in Manhattan at a similar price!"
235,1945,"Apr 2 2004	Good but it just needs a little bit more	We stayed at the Marcel for 4 nights. First the good: The staff was very pleasant. Being greeted by a doorman, the lobby cappuccino machine and wonderful continental breakfast were very nice touches. I really liked the decor as well, it was simple &amp; stylish. Yes the rooms in Manhattan are small. At the Marcel, I saw a single bed room and I was very glad we weren't staying in one. The double bed room we had was a good size for the city. The showers had fabulous hot water all of the time. The hotel location was wonderful. Friendly pubs, groceries, &amp; diners right there on the block, a Walgreen's down the street &amp; very convenient to the #6 train, and the bus stop right outside on the corner. The hotel really has the potential of being great, it just needs a little more attention to detail, once you leave the lobby area it loses its glimmer. There is only one (slow) elevator for the entire building, and the staircases are used primarily by the maid staff -- I ended up in the service area when I tried to take them down. The AC didn' t work at all in our room so we had to open the window which looked out to a brick wall and roof below. There was no screen on the window, and we were nervous about the many visible pigeons making there way into our room if we kept the window open to high. Unlucky for us that our neighbors above woke us up at 4:30 a.m. each morning, and the shower pipes seemed to rattle up there. I would stay here again, but for the price, I would really like to see some improvements with the quality of the facilities."
236,1945,"Mar 31 2004	Needs an Excellent Managment Staff to bring it to life!	Small and centrally located, this hotel could use some work. I was completely ready for small rooms since I had travelled to NYC before and knew small rooms were normal. Since it was concidered to be a &quot;boutique&quot; hotel, i thougt it would pay more attention to detail, however, the airconditioner wouldn't perform as any normal unit would. The desk staff were very friendly and accomodating. The music in the lobby was more than loud enough to start a party. The cappucino maker in the lobby was a very nice touch with continental breakfast as complimentary. The used gilchrist and soames bath products which raises them to a boutique level hotel, but over all it had a feeling that seemed musty, a bit dirty and in definite need of an excellent management staff that could easily make this a little gem of a hotel to stay. A note about me, I'm a guy and a bed, bathroom, and airconditioner is what I normally require however when one of those items isn't running properly, I tend to get bent out of shape. I'm simple and when going to a boutique hotel isn't a simple and easy fix, this seasoned traveller tells others. The end result? Would I stay here again??? Yes, if the damn AC is working properly and the locks would give a proper sense of security. I hope you enjoy your travels wherever you go."
237,1945,"Mar 28 2004	Great value for your money!	I stayed in the Marcel last weekend for a quick trip to NYC. This is a great place to stay if you're looking for a place to sleep on a tight budget. The bed was large, very comfortable, and looked exactly like it does in the pictures on the hotel's website. What the picture does not convey so well is how small the room is. However, its New York and if you want what would be an average sized room anywhere else, expect to pay for it. The bathroom was very nice with marble and a pedastal sink. We had a view of the Empire State Building which was unexpected, but nice. I have also stayed in the Ameritania and prefer the Marcel because it was better lit and not so dingy looking as the Ameritania. There is only 1 elevator and it is slow and small. Do not stay in the Marcel if you are a heavy packer and have loads of luggage as there is very little space to store them in the regular rooms. I have no idea how much space is availabe in their studios. However, if you'll only be in the city for a short while, the Marcel would be a great place, especially if you want to save your money for more fun activities in the city!"
238,1945,"Mar 15 2004	Good Budget Hotel	I stayed at the Marcel Hotel last week with a few apprehensions after reading the reviews on this site about the lack of heat. But, my friend recommended this hotel to me, saying that it was a decent place despite the very small rooms, so I decided to give it a shot.The sleeping rooms are definitely small, but if all you need is a place to lay your head at night, it'll do. The bathroom was pretty nice with marble floors and tiles and a pedestal sink. I love pedestal sinks, but there wasn't much space to put my toiletries down.The decor of the hotel and the rooms is minimalist chic and reminds me of IKEA furniture. I liked the furniture decor in the lobby and the lounge.A nice feature is that the Marcel offers free bagels, orange juice and coffee in the morning...not too many places offer complimentary food anymore!My biggest complaint is that my room was way too hot for me! (opposite from other reviews I've read here) It was an oven when I walked in and I had to turn on the cooler which helped me that evening, but when I woke up the next morning, the cool air turned into hot air and I was sweating and roasting again! I called to complain and ask about the heating/air controls and they told me it was central heating and could not be controlled in individual rooms, so they sent an engineer up to help me open my window which helped immensely!The down side was that my room faced E. 24th St. so since I had to sleep with the window open so I wouldn't sweat to death, I ended up not sleeping well due to the noise from the street below.The walls are thin, the hallsway are narrow, and the elevator is tiny, but it's still a decent hotel for the price you're paying.I liked the area because it was less touristy and more residential (it's near a college) and it was a nice walk to Greenwich Village and Soho.The price I got for this hotel was $109, but I think it could be a little less for what you get...like $89-99.But, since it's New York City, $109 is probably still a good deal."
239,1945,"Feb 20 2004	We thought it was great	We were also a bit worried, having read a bad review just before we left England. However, we were very pleasantly surprised. The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly. The room was extremely clean and very warm. The breakfast included in the price was an added bonus as we thought the price was only for the room. Coffee was available at all times and free of charge in the downstairs foyer. We would certainly recommend the hotel."
240,1945,"Feb 17 2004	Pleasantly Surprised!	I was very weary about going to this hotel after reading some shocking reviews, but I am happy to report that our stay at the Marcel was very comfortable. Fair enough, the room was small but like prevoisly said, space is hard to come by in NY. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was spotless and the room was cleaned every day. Heater/AC was in excellent working order though our latch was a bit suspect, but you always have another lock. The elevator was in prefect condition and breakfast was always waiting for you coming down at 7am. The doorman always opened doors for us and even arranged to store our baggage after we checked out so we could finish off some sightseeing, he even arranged a car to take us to the airport. All the staff greeted you with a smile and were pleasant. All in all I would definetly recommed the Marcel for anyone on a tight budget or who are just looking for a place to rest their weary feet. WELL DONE MARCEL! You made our trip complete."
241,1945,"Jan 23 2004	Shocking - Never again!!!!!	This hotel is a disgrace. I stayed for three nights in December 2003. They overcharged; took unauthorised payments from my credit card; and were rude and unco-operative. Most of the people who work for the hotel who I have dealt with have a poor command of English and a &quot;can't do, won't do&quot; mentality. New York was fabulous, but the Hotel Marcel provided me with the one of the worst hotel experiences I have endured."
242,1945,"Jan 13 2004	Funky Hotel Great Value - Would stay again.	I recently stayed at the Marcel for a few days and must say it was a great find! It's only about a 10 - 15 minute walk from Grand Central Station and the walk is a small price to pay. The hotel is very clean, safe &amp; friendly. I loved the decor - very funky / trendy. The bed was sooooo comfortable. The rooms are small - but this is NYC; space is hard to come by! For the value, I would definately recommend this hotel, or one in it's chain (nychotels.com) they are all great; if you are planning to visit NY."
243,1945,"Jan 12 2004	Where's the Beef?	Our experience at this hotel was very good. We got an excellent rate and grabbed our two rooms without doing much research. I was quite nervous after reading the recent reviews. If it was ever as bad as described, The Marcel has since addressed the problems others have experienced. We were there this past weekend, when temperatures dropped to nearly zero. We had excellent heat, plenty of hot water, very clean rooms, working lights, friendly and helpful staff, and no trouble at all with our reservations. The lobby has some nice seating areas and the bagels for breakfast were fresh and served until 11 AM. The rooms ARE tiny, but very functional and comfortable. You DO have to send down for ice, which came quickly. The cappacino machine didn't work right, but you could get free coffee 24 hours a day. The hotel halls are dreary, but it's reasonably quiet even though you're on 3rd Avenue. It's near some good restaurants and shops and it's easy to use the subway and flag cabs. We'd stay there again and recommend it to anyone. I've had horrible experiences at hotels in my time.... This was not only fine, but a positive experience. Give it another chance."
244,1945,"Jan 4 2004	Pleasant stay	Pleasant accommodating staff. Rooms extremely clean. Not afraid to walk around room barefoot. Beds and pillows get an A+. Bathrooms newer and very clean. Convenient location. However, rooms are very small. I made reservations online that stated that there was a cocktail bar at this hotel. There is no cocktail bar. Overall, a nice place to stay...price reasonable."
245,1945,"Dec 19 2003	Lovely Stay	I was made nervous by the other reviews, but I was delighted at my choice to stay at the Marcel Hotel. Primarily, the location is ideal. It is close to the 4,5,6 Trains, and is short blocks away from Union Square, St. Marks, Soho, etc. The staff was curtious and friendly. Check in and out was a breeze. The room was a comfortable size- bigger than expected for NYC and well designed. The bathroom had a lovely shower and nice fixtures. The bed was very cozy and very large, and we had four down pillows with a lovely white comforter. Two large closets and the bookshelves made it very easy to settle into. The espresso machine works fine, although not amazing. And breakfast was as simple as you can get-OJ with bagels The only cons: the tv didn't get many channels and the cd player was low quality. The toilet ran a while after flushing, but worked fine. Our heater wasn't so great, but luckily, the room had a nice and very powerful space heater. And the elevator is SLOW and rather crummy.But all in all, I would certainly stay here again. The hotel is geared towards the pleasure traveler, rather than business. It is rather small and thus very quiet- we hardly ever saw or heard other guests (almost all vacationing couples). And the staff is respectful and discreet. Another big plus: It is on a street with many many good restaurants (esp. Irish Pubs and Sushi places, go figure).Stayed on the 7th floor."
246,1945,"Nov 26 2003	Seriously disappointed by the Marcel!	Plumbing problems, central heat not working, struggle with the hotel management to get a space heater into our room even though it was Winter in NYC! Misinformation about travel options to get to the airport and did I mention the plumbing problems? Yes, that kind of plumbing problem. Do not spend your money here. It's not even that great of a deal and you could spend an extra few bucks a night and get a better hotel."
247,1945,"Nov 4 2003	Solid Value Hotel	I was a little nervous after reading the reviews here, but I am happy to report that the Marcel was a solid value for the money. Indeed, the rooms are small, but this is NY. The decor was nice, with a very comfortable kind bed, plenty of mirrors and great water pressure. The lighting was a bit dim and the bathroon was &quot;one at a time,&quot; the rooms facing the street are noisy. All in all the Marcel offered a comfortable bed, in a great location, at a low cost."
248,1945,"Oct 2 2003	A great find!	I read some good and some bad reviews here before leaving, so I'm happy to be able to report that my experience was great! True, the elevator was broken when we arrived, but an employee helped us carry our bags up the stairs (one flight) and it was repaired by the evening. New York hotels are sooo expensive so I loved the price (we used hotels and beat every other advertised price I found). Of course, corners have to be cut to make the price that good - pencils instead of pens on the desk, 15-inch instead of 20-inch TV, etc. I didn't feel at all disappointed by those things - I was glad they chose to offer an economical hotel for people like us!The room was clean and the air conditioning worked. The bathroom was fully stocked with mini soaps and shampoos - they were some brand called &quot;east&quot; a cool variation on the usual hotel stuff.The decor in the rooms and the lobby was hip and the lobby was full of male models (presumably there for Fashion Week) when we arrived. The hallways were a little dark and gloomy but not a big deal.The location was great - close to our friend in the village and a few subway stops from the Empire State Building.The staff was pleasant and helpful - they arranged us a cab to the airport ahead of time so that we could have a last lunch in the city and relax.Also, my companion would want me to say that the mattress was great! We stayed in another hotel a few nights before and it left us with sore backs - the Marcel was a great night's sleep.Overall, we'd stay there again in a heartbeat (if only we could take another trip so soon!) and we'd recommend it to anyone like us who is budget conscious, prefers a unique experience to a chain, and who wants a good night's sleep!"
249,1945,Sep 25 2003	Tiny Rooms but decent Value	We visited New York and booked 2 nights at the Marcel. The rooms were VERY tiny but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a good size with a hot shower and good water pressure. The facility does not have a fitness center as they advertise on the website and the night staff was a bit rude - but the day doorman was great and was very helpful with directions and storing our luggage until check-in. If you are looking for a spacious hotel with lots of perks - this is not it... but for a decent price with light breakfast included that's 1 block from the subway (with a private bath).. it's not bad if all you need a room for is to sleep!
250,1945,"Sep 18 2003	Never again - hotel is worst experience	While I read many reviews before going to hotels, I can't say that I always abide by what others say. Well in the case of the Marcel - I should have. The experience was horrible, the worst I have ever encountered in all my years of traveling (and I have traveled EXTENSIVELY both for business and pleasure). The service and employees ruined the entire experience. We were LIED to throughout our entire experience. the reservation was booked through hotels website for 3 adults in a standard triple - with 2 double beds (guaranteed and paid for up front) When we got to the hotel the individual at the desk said they did not have room for us, other than one with a double bed, and then they would give us a roll-away for the 3rd person. well, a roll-away barely opens in the room, and then there is no place for luggage, etc. We were staying for 4 nights - and there was no way this would work for 3 people. However, they said that they never guarantee a room type, and that while the reservation stated 2 beds -- the roll-away was the 2nd bed. If we had known this then we would have never reserved this hotel. Additionally we made the reservation on 9/11 to arrive 9/12. When we arrived on 9/12, the guy at the fron desk stated that they knew since 9/10, that they did not have any rooms available with 2 double beds. Why they would allow this reservation is beyond me. Maybe because they are used to lieing. Since we had fully paid for the 4 nights our options were to stay there with the roll-away, or to go to another one of their sister properties. However, the guy at the desk also said (and GUARANTEED) that if we stayed in the room with the roll-away for the first night, then the other 3 nights they DEFINITELY had a room with 2 doubles. so we chose that option because we were stupid enough to believe the lies. The other thing was there is no manager on duty to help you - so you are SOL. Not that the manager at the Marcel (&quot;Jay&quot; ) was any more honest or more concerned about customer service. The next day when we spoke with Jay he said that they did not have a room with 2 doubles, and that there was no way his emplyee would have guaranteed that there would be a room with 2 doubles. Well he did - I'm sure just to get us off his back, and make Jay deal with us, since he would not be there the next day. So we were lied to when we made the reservation, and lied to again when we were told we could have the room we wanted for the remainer of the stay. Then after arguing with Jay for a while the only alternative was to move to their sister properlty 'the Amertania' - which Jay stated (lied) was a nicer property. NEver mind that is was not in the location we wanted. He also PROMISED we would ont only get a room with 2 doubles, but we would get a Junior suite. Well as you can expect, Jay LIED again. We had to cart all our stuff over to the Amertania (they did not pay for the cab or anything) -- and of course no junior suite available - only 2 doubles. That property was musty smelling, rooms were not very clean, etc... Needless to stay I will never stay at the Marcel again, nor any of Amsterdam Hospitality Group's hotels (Marcel, Amertania, Amsterdam court, Bentley). They will tell you what ever they want and never deliver on their so-called promises. The service is basically the worst I have ever experienced in hotels"
251,1945,"Sep 10 2003	Here is the real Deal	I first booked the room at the Marcel for 117.00$ then realized I should have checked the reviews of the place. When I came to this website I became a little concerned with what I read about the Marcel. Well, I write this review to express what I encountered...it was a pleasnt surprise. I did realize the price was fairly cheap for a night stay in NYC, the neighborhood is safe, located close to all attractions, with that in mind I knew I wasnt staying in the Waldorf. The staff was very pleasant, especially the doorman..and &quot;Yes&quot; your in NYC, so when the doorman provides any service, there is a tip expected. The rooms were somewhat small, but I'll say this I have stayed in other more expensive Hotels, ie. The Paramount, and their rooms are even smaller. The rooms are clean and neat. The showers were hot, the toilet worked and the hotel was quiet. My only complaint was one that should be taken seriously....the security. The doorman did a great job screening the people entering the samll entrance way...but the locks on the door have the card key entrance, this is normal in most hotels. However, there is a deadbolted, and that can only be secured when you are actually within the room. My main concern was that the door can be opened by shimming the lock cam with any hard plastic card,ie. credit card, drivers license,etc. It was easy to do and I actually had my wife try it and she made entery with ease. This should be addressed in any hotel, but especially in NYC. I felt no threat so I never bought it to their attention, in retrospect I probally should have. Overall, i would still stay in the hotel again, it is just 114.00$ and with that in mind it's a pretty nice stay."
252,1945,Aug 18 2003	Small closet size rooms	Very very small rooms. The rooms are closet size and you hardly have enough room to open a large suitcase. The room however was clean.I would not stay at this hotel again - it is just not worth it.
253,1945,"Jul 21 2003 	Trendy	Great location! Lots of Restuarants south of this hotel on 3rd. Room is small, but it's New York, hope you wouldn't be in your room. Ask for a room 2 floors above the very trendy lounge, some noise. If you can get this hotel for arorund $100 its a good deal, don't pay more. Neighborhood is ideal for first time visitors."
254,1945,"Jul 8 2003	Rude awful staff!!!!	I booked a hotel room here through an on-line site that does not charge the customer until the actual date of stay. Imagine my surprise when I was actually charged for the room before I even showed up! When I decided to cancel, after reading all of the many horrific reviews here, I had the awful experience first hand of dealing with the terribly rude staff! Not only had they made my reservations for the wrong dates, they were going to charge me a no-show fee, and had the audacity to get nasty with me over the telephone! Then I had to submit substantial proof of the days that I actually was due to stay there! The refund finally came after having to negotiate with these idiots for over a month. My best advice is not to deal with these people....way too much of a headache!"
255,1945,"Jul 3 2003	AUGH!!	what an aggravating place to stay! the phone was broken, the tv and remote didn't work, the toilet had a symphonic hammer pipes problem, and the staff was rude, unhelpful, patronizing, and insulting. only after i pitched a complete fit and threaten to report them after 3 days of complete aggravation did they start to treat me with any decency. add to that the fact that the rooms are wildly divergent--after having booked a superior two double bed room, i was placed in a non-smoking room that stank of cigarette smoke, had no room to even walk around the bed in, and didn't have a tv. when i complained they finally moved me, and after that, every single time i came in to the hotel from outside my key had been reprogrammed--a bit of passive aggression on the part of the staff, i assume. the hotel itself is very nicely appointed, despite all the broken stuff, and the neighborhood is wonderful, but i just don't think the hassle is worth it."
256,1945,May 20 2003	Small but very confortable rooms	This small boutique hotel is perfect for a budgeted get away. Its is perfectly located in between the village area and midtown. Madison Square Park is 2 blocks away. The location is ideal. The staff was very accomodating. We were satisfied with our first room at all and they were happy to give us another which was much better. I would suggest to ask for room with a window opening on 3rd. Ave. or 24st. The rooms are quaint and clean. I will definately stay there on my next trip to NY.

1,1949,Very good value hotel with modern style	The hotel is very well located in the midtown area of Manhattan. Within walking distance to two subway stops. Madison park and Union square are also within a few blocks distance. The rooms are not huge but have more than enough space. The decor is modern and the staff is extremely diligent in helping with any request. I would definitely recommend this hotel for any type of travel.
2,1949,"Nov 25 2009 	Terrible	Horrible experience. Dreaded going back to this hovel after a day out in NY. Breakfast was lame to say the least and the noise was nothing short of disgraceful. Might as well have been out on the footpath trying to sleep. We all know it's New York bla bla bla but it's no noisier outside than any other city.They tried to move us to a different room (not that that would have been hard considering the shoe box we were in), thinking that a bigger room would satisfy us. It was of course just as noisy. We ended up sleeping with the air conditioning on to drown out the noise of traffic.Most certainly will never be back here, almost ruined our 5 nights in NY. As well as the above it was impersonal and over-priced. Boutique hotel? I think not."
3,1949,"Nov 24 2009 	Super location clean rooms.	I've just spent five nights at the Mave. The rooms are noisy, as other reviewers have noted. But then  welcome to New York! Still, this place is worth recommending on the basis of the location, which is fantastic (equidistant from uptown and downtown, and within walking distance of many attractions and good restaurants), the friendliness of the staff, and also on the cleanliness of the rooms. They are, it must be said, tiny, but again, that's New York for you. Space is at a premium. One issue: in the laughably-titled penthouse there are no bedside lamps for reading at night. This is ludicrous. (It implies that the guests can't read.) But that's a relatively small quibble. In short, this is a super-convenient, funky, clean, relatively inexpensive new hotel. Recommended."
4,1949,"Nov 22 2009 	Fabulous hotel with fantastic staff!	This was our first trip to NY and we spent the first 5 nights at the MAve (on their stay for 5, pay for 4 promotion). I had read the reviews here on TA before booking, but it was a very new hotel then and had just opened with only a few reviews. I was a little concerned as I read of the noise problem and it is a problem, however I have since read they are installing buffers around the airconditioners. It does sound like the window is WIDE open, even though it is closed. However, I can say, you get used to it if you stay long enough! The first night (and after a 21 hour flight) it was extremely loud, traffic, tooting, sirens, garbage trucks and street sweepers - I could not sleep from the noise or jet-lag! We were on the 6th floor. However, we did not complain and actually got used to the noise after the 2nd night. Nights 3-5 we slept soundly (from exhaustion from the hectic days).However I will still give this hotel 5*s purely for effort from their staff. Everyone we spoke with helped us happily and always asked if there was more they could do. The guys on at night would recommend dinners, night spots, places to make sure we should see (Halloween parade). There was also a bottle of champagne in our room on arrival for our anniversary.The rooms are extremely clean and an adequate size. We hardly spent any time in them so we didn't need extra space. Great location in the middle of 2 subway lines so we could get whereever we needed to go easily.And lastly the breakfast on the go was great! Would get ourselves some fresh coffee and a few danishes and dash out the door for another day of exploring such a fabulous city. We also stayed at another hotel for the last 2 nights and preferred this one of the 2."
5,1949,"Nov 19 2009 	Don't stay at MAve Hotel if you want a good night's sleep.	We stayed at MAve for 3 nights &amp; it was like we were right on the street with all the trucks, cars, sirens &amp; traffic. We were given air plugs &amp; tried to sleep with television on &amp; AC unit turned up to drown out noise, but it was still really bad. When I complained, the desk clerk said &quot;You should live where I do, if you think this is noisy&quot;. Not a very good thing to say to a paying guest. We paid a significant amount for our room which I thought we could have done a lot better for the price we paid. It was a lot of money for 3 sleepless nights."
6,1949,"Nov 17 2009 	Mave is the Rave!	I knew I was in for something different when the Taxi was dropping me off at the hotel and you can see the vibrant colors of red and ballons in the lobby. I was quickly welcomed before I got my bags off the trunk and checked in in a flash. I expected fast service being in New York, but wow, the personal touch with a little welcome note from the hotel in my room, and the attentive and gracious staff, I trully enjoyed my short but sweet stay at the Mave. In town for business, this is a great location, and actually walked around and found I can be a tourist enjoying the scenerary, walked as far as my legs took me, and fond myself in Time Square. (20 blocks or so) This is a prime location but moreover, the hotel feel is chic, stylish, and vibrant. I stayed previously at another hotel and like most, dark furnishings and not much light in the room. but at the Mave, the hotel Shines!"
7,1949,"Nov 16 2009 	Modern and Modestly Priced	I stayed at The MAve during a business trip to NYC and was definitely pleased with the place. As many other reviewers have noted, the rooms aren't large. They are, however, extremely clean and functional - almost spartan in their efficiency. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful - hailing cabs, answering questions, providing as much information as they could about the city (which I had never visited before). Pricewise, it was very reasonable given the great location. NYC will never be a super cheap place to stay, but among the options, The MAVe is a well-priced option for most travelers. I would recommend it to anyone.They're also on Twitter, which is great. @theMAveHotel - give them a shout!"
8,1949,Nov 1 2009 	Nice but small	The staff was wonderful in helping us with everything from making dinner reservations to bringing ice up to our room. We had a King size room and it sounds like we had more space than most of the other reviews. We had a small desk with one chair and a WONDERFUL king size bed. The air conditioner was only a window unit and kept the room nice and cool. If you are looking for a room where you will only be sleeping and not spending a large amount of time I think this is an excellent deal.
9,1949,"Oct 28 2009 	Clean simple polite staff noisy room...could be cheaper.	We chose The MAve for our first 2 nights in NYC last weekend. We wanted to experience staying in 2 different areas, and spotted this hotel on Trip Advisor for our first. Was very new at the time, quite far down the ratings list...but only because it was recently added. Every hotel needs to start somewhere, so we decided to go for it.To start, the area is perfect. Very central. We prefer walking, so it is very well located to discover Midtown to Central Park. There is also a subway stop within 5 minutes, easy. Just round the corner from Madison Square Park (Shake Shack...a must, Flatiron Building, etc), down the road from Empire State, not too far from Union Square (great, student area...bars, restaurants). Now, the hotel...The staff upon arrival and throughout our stay...extremely helpful, courteous...tick all the boxes in so far as customer service goes.The room...we chose the Boulevard King, and found it to be very spacious and comfortable. BUT....and this is a massive problem....the noise. I am so happy that we were given ear plugs on our flight over to NYC because they really came in handy when we went to bed. Ear plugs + jet lag = pleasant combination when staying at The MAve. I had asked for high floor room because I had read some negative reviews about the noise...but we were put on the 6th, being assured that as our room was not actually on Madison Ave, the room would be quiet and peaceful. Everything you have read about noise so far is true....the 24/7 traffic carries, no matter which side of the hotel you stay on, and it is true indeed...the old style air conditioners fitted into the windows are flanked by flimsy plastic sheets...even with the windows closed, it sounds like they are wide open. I didn't complain about the noise - seriously, there is not a lot the staff can do. I am not a complainer, I am a put-up-with'er. And I did not have trouble sleeping...like I said, ear plugs and jet lag. We were all in all, comfortable, and we did have a generally pleasant, trouble free stay.A few closing comments:1) The hotel has been open for most of the year now, so when will the 2nd elevator be sorted out? It wasn't such a big deal, only sometimes we had to wait for a more than a few minutes.2) I would agree that this hotel is more of a trendy, up scale hostel, as there are zero facilities offered by the hotel direct (room service is catered for by restaurant up the road, and breakfast, although not experienced, also sounds like it is arranged externally, and according to other reviews...well...just go to a deli instead). Imagine a trendy New York apartment building, but instead of renting apartments, you are renting a room. That is kind of how it feels.3) We did pay more for the Boulevard King...I don't like cramped rooms, and it turned out to be a nice size. But considering what's on offer in general, I do think they could slash the prices considerably. I dislike giving negative reviews - too often I read reviews from people who obviously just have anger problems or expect way too much. But I will be honest in what I write and overall, I think we could have done slightly better than The MAve for the price we paid. Such simple things like good noise insulation and at least a small, in house breakfast bar could make the world of difference."
10,1949,"Oct 22 2009 	Upscale adult hostel no working elevators or breakfast	Positives: friendly staff, free wifi, comfy bed &amp; lots of pillows (very firm), H2O bathroom amenities, huge shower head, &amp; near subway; Negatives: no working elevators and had to walk up seven flights of stairs with metal covering (VERY noisy), breakfast consisted of coffee at 8:30 am on Sunday, postage-size room (upgraded @ $20/night to queen, much better), all street noise penetrates wafer-thin accordian screen holding window heating/cooling system, area offers little of interest (well, there is the museum of sex.) If you try Hotwire and it comes up boutique hotel, this could be it. You will get hotwire room, as an earlier visitor noted. This hotel remains a work in progress. Needs more public space and a restaurant, and a public bathroom to use when your room is not ready. Staff can only do so much (and admitted 101% booked, so I guess it is popular.)"
11,1949,"Oct 15 2009 	Lovely new hotel that is still working out some minor kinks.	The Mave is a lovely hotel in a great location right up from Madison Square Garden (the park, not the sports arena). The staff, from concierge to housekeeping, were among the friendliest and helpful I have ever come across. The rooms are very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel, as mentioned in other reviews, just opened in the summer and therefore some issues still need ironing out. Again as previously mentioned, there is a fair amount of noise that bleeds into the rooms through the window air conditioning/heater units however it didn't really bother us and we understand that they are working on fixing this. Our key cards had a tendency to deprogram and we found ourselves twice up on the seventh floor unable to unlock our door. The second time, there was a hotel employee on our floor who immediately let us into our room and ran downstairs to re-program our card for us. The fire alarms are a little too sensitive and went off twice when the steam from our shower escaped from the bathroom. Luckily the sprinkle didn't go off !! When I phoned the front desk to let them know, they were extremely apologetic and offered to send someone up right away. In my opinion, these are pretty minor issues and once they are addressed, The Mave will be top-notch. We look forward to staying here again."
12,1949,"Oct 14 2009 	Bring your earplugs and be adept when walking around bed	I agree with the other Tripadvisor comments- clean, small room, and NOISE coming from the outside city streets at all hours thru the flimsy plastic on the sides of the window a/c- heat unit (even on a higher floor). &quot;Breakfast&quot;- small variety of danish and coffee served only until 9 am even on weekends ( a guest on the single tiny elevator complained to me). When this hotel opened summer '09- the light breakfast fare included several imported cheeses, french rolls, and coffees until 11am. No storage area in the bathroom-only one small glass shelf, use the top of the dresser in the bedroom and no mirrors in bedroom(would help alot!) Very friendly at front desk with greetings,bringing water to room, wakeup calls, etc.Great location- near great shopping and wonderful restaurants- away from the hustle of Midtown."
13,1949,"Oct 12 2009 	Nice Hotel in a good location	Just got back from a three night stay and found almost everything to be excellent. The only problem is that the hotel is retrofitted and uses window unit heating and cooling. This lets in a good bit of noise. We talked with the front desk and they told me that they are ordering sound buffers to go around the unit. This should help alot. Otherwise the room is small but about average in NY. Certainly not the smallest I have stayed in. Don't stay in room alot in NYC. The staff is great. The location is good. The grab up breakfast is good. Just know there is nowhere to sit. The beds are nice and comfy. Hotel is clean, newly remodeled and good especially for a short trip."
14,1949,"Oct 6 2009 	nice but be aware there are problems	my wife and I stayed one night this past weekend, October 3, 2009. Good rate through hotwire, $ 180+, plus taxes and agency fees. The hotel has just been renovated and is very nice. The staff is very friendly, the location is good and is near both east and westside subway stations. Breakfast is also very nice.The &quot;Two Big Issues&quot; that you need to be aware of. The rooms are very small. Our room did not have a chair, If you wanted to sit down you needed to sit on the bed. In order to get from one side of the room to the other, one person would need to move out of the way. In fairness to the hotel, our room appeared to be the smallest room on our floor, based on the door chart in our room.The heating and cooling system for the hotel is a unit similar to a traditional a/c window unit, with plastic on either side of the unit to cover the rest of the open window.This piece of plastic is 1/16 of an inch thick and is the only thing between you and the &quot;City that never sleeps&quot;. No double glazed windows here, You will hear every sound that goes on outside. They may provide ear plugs, we did not ask. If you can get beyond the smallness and noise of the room, everything else is very nice and I would recommend staying here."
15,1949,"Sep 26 2009 	Just plain too noisy	The Mave has good and bad points. Unfortunately, the bad outweigh the good. First, the good: great location, friendly staff, very clean rooms, strong (and free) wifi signal. Now for the bad: noisy, noisy, noisy. We were on the second floor and the street noise bordered on the unbearable. We live in a city and are used to street noise, but this was over the top. There were times we thought people and cars were actually in our room. Ran the air conditioner constantly in a futile attempt to have the white noise block out the street noise, but even that didn't work. The noise really adversely impacted our stay -- but for that we could have overlooked the other problems. Which included the fact that the bathroom is so small they just have a half wall for a shower door. Which means the bathroom floor gets soaking wet every time someone takes a shower. I've experienced that in third world countries where the room costs $30 a night, but I do not expect that in Manhattan at the rates charged there. And, according to the in-room amenity description, extra towels costs extra -- we didn't try to order any so I can't say whether they would have actually charged us but, seriously, who charges extra for a towel when the room only has two towels to begin with? Finally, breakfast was not at all as advertised. The one morning we made it down in time for breakfast (at 8 am so not late), there was nothing left but some sort of rolls. Bottom line, we won't be back."
16,1949,"Sep 24 2009 	Where did this little jewel come from?	I am very impressed. There's no public space. There are red and white balloons where the restaurant should be. The rooms are typical NYC tiny. AND I LOVED THIS HOTEL. It's the people, people, people. Where did they find these sweet, professional, warm people? The leader of the front desk seems to be a brilliantly engaged woman named Annetta. She's a fire ball of warmth, professionalism and kindness. And her staff follows right behind. I'll give up not having a restaurant. I'll give up a lobby. I'll even give up a room with...well room. But I won't give up an empathetic staff. So that makes this my new favorite hotel in New York."
17,1949,"Sep 23 2009 	Customer centric	Hotel well located close to Madison square, good, safe area. Underground easy to access. Walking distance to many NY highlights.Rooms have been renovated recently and decoration is moderne. Although on 10th floor (out of 12), the noise of the street was very audible in the room and woke us up during nights.Rooms were clean.Need to watch how it will evolve over time. Hotel personnel lead by Anetta very customer oriented, polite, ready to make good recommendations (for restaurants in the area) and find solutions (eg breakfast was not as described, but quickly found a solution)No breakfast room, so only grap and go coffee and rolls - a space for sitting would be appropriate.In summary - a good hotel ahead of NY standards differentiated by recent renovation and friendly personnel."
18,1949,"Sep 21 2009 	Amazing Service	I recently stayed at The MAve and had an experience second to none. The staff was amazing from the time we walked in until our final goodbye. The bed made in hard to leave the room, H20 products as well as the rain head showers are awesome, and the staff really sealed the deal. I felt like I had a personal assistant to the city, great recomendations in the area, and attention to deatail made my stay the best I have had in NYC."
19,1949,"Sep 18 2009 	A Really Nice Surprise	Found a fantastic deal on this hotel and didn't quite know what to expect given that fantastic deals and NYC are a rare combination. We were very pleasantly surprised.Most noteworthy...THE STAFF - Every single person we came in contact with was very friendly and helpful.LOCATION - Perfectly situated in the middle of the city without being too close to Times Square. Easy access to the Theaters, Penn Station (take the train in from the airport!), and - most importantly - The Shake Shack!INCLUSIONS - Breakfast (small) and WiFi are included. Awesome!ROOMS - Although small (SMALL, small), they are well appointed, remarkably quiet and comfortable.AGE - They have done everything that they can given this is an update of an old building. Inconveniences (slow elevators, no restaurant, the smallest workout room on the planet) are minimal."
20,1949,"Sep 18 2009 	Clean new friendly	Searching for a reasonably-priced hotel to stay in during the crush of Fashion Week, I found the highly-rated MAve on TripAdvisor. My colleagues and I spent 3 nights there earlier this week and found it to be worthy of the positive reviews. Yes the rooms are small, but they're very clean, the staff is super-helpful, and the hotel is conveniently located on Madison Avenue near Washington Square Park and the subway. It's a great value, and I'll stay there again."
21,1949,"Sep 5 2009 	Great Location Great Staff	Just got back from NYC for the first time. We took our 1 1/2 year old, and my wife and I. The Mave turned out to be great location for getting anywhere in midtown Manhattan.Madio (sp?), the door man and Aneta were the first two people that we met in NYC and they were good to us. They helped us navigate the city to all kinds of good places.The rooms were a little small, but from what we here, it is typical for the Manhattan. But, really, how much time do you spend in your room?The location was awesome. Within walking distance to Madison Park, Madison Square Garden, cheap shopping, Empire State Building and all kinds of other good things.I would stay in The MAve again."
22,1949,"Aug 31 2009 	Perfect stay!	Me and my girlfriend just stayed 9 nights at The MAve and we had a perfect stay. The Hotel was clean, and the hotel staff was very forthcomming and helpfull! Will recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay while enjoying the great city of NYC."
23,1949,"Aug 31 2009 	the website does not reflect this hotel....	Warning Warning...Great name Great Location..Then it all turns bad...This is not a boutique hotel .This Hotel is a budget tourist hotel.And they should be discounting the rates..Only one very slow elevator in use and this was broken on the first night of my visit..I was upgraded,but the room was hideous with black and white zebra carpetand laminated white furniture..But this was supposedly the best room on offer..The water was not replaced .either were the toiletries or tea and coffee sachets..No Bar Fridge?..Three requests later the water arrived...The hallways were dark and the floor coverings really dirty..Now the reception staff are really polite as are the bellboys.But i was not the onlyguest complaining and I felt rather sorry for the staff..I asked for the managers card,none available and the manager was not available.If you want the pancake breakfast,you are given a voucher and sent to a cafe , thisis not mentioned on the website same applies for the massage service.(salon)nearby....When I asked the staff if they ate at the terrible cafe that issued the voucher, theyall replied a resounding No , but the manager liked the cafe..........Yes this is a new hotel.But they need to focus on clean rooms etc etc.But this could not be regarded as a stylish boutique hotel.The manager should open their eyes ..and perhaps visit a stylish boutique hotel..If you want a cheap room with a good location this is the place...It is not a business hotel..be warned...."
24,1949,"Aug 30 2009 	Good value but a few glitches.......	We enjoyed our stay at the Mave, and found it to be an excellent value, conveniently located. Our room was small, but very clean, and attractively made up. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. The continental breakfast of artisanal cheeses and rolls was tasty and interesting, though a bit repetitive, day after day.. However, there were a few areas that may still need a little work. There is no seating whatsoever in the lobby area, which made it necessary to stand about balancing coffee and rolls in the morning, or while awaiting one's taxi or companion at other times. Granted, there's not much room, but even a couple of long low benches would have been most welcome. One of the 2 elevators was out of service for all of our 4 day stay, and the remaining one broke down on the morning of our departure. Luckily, we were only on the 5th floor, but that was still a workout, hauling our suitcases downstairs. There was hardly anywhere in the bathroom or the room to hang up our wet towels - a couple more hooks or a towel bar would have been great. Shelf space for our bathroom toiletries was similiarly nonexistent. I was disappointed to find no computer available for guest use, but I should have asked that question ahead of time. The promised mini-bar was not there, and the staff politely let me know that they could not fulfill my request for a fridge in our room. Sayonara, all those good NYC leftovers.....Finally, the lobby decor and music were awfully disco feeling for my provincial taste - a lot of shiny red walls and glitzy glass light fixtures. But that's strictly personal. All in all, the Mave offered a stylish, comfortable, and affordable haven in the city."
25,1949,Aug 27 2009 	French breads and cheeses...mmmm.....	This has to have been THE cleanest hotel i have ever stayed in. Loved the fact the rooms have hardwood floors rather than carpet. The staff are superb! Pleasant and efficient. A great location; not too touristy but close to everything you need. And nothing beats waking up to fresh coffee with a variety of delicious french breads and cheeses. That's my kind of continental breakfast!
26,1949,"Aug 25 2009 	Thanks for making our 25th anniversary so special!	We just wanted to say thanks to all the staff at the Mave for making our recent stay so wonderful! When we arrived to celebrate our 25th anniversary we had been upgraded to a bigger room and some champagne was sent up for us. The room was lovely, very clean with a big comfy bed and room to spread out. The complimentary breakfast-to-go was delicious. All the staff were friendly, warm and helpful, from the front desk to the cleaning staff we passed in the hall. We have already recommended your hotel to friends and colleagues and hope to return in the future,"
27,1949,"Aug 23 2009 	We would go back for the staff !!!	Hi,We stayed at The Mave for 9 nights, and we simply loved the hotel for the staff. The staff is super friendly and would go out of their way to help the guests. Though all the staff is friendly, if you find John at the front desk, you have to talk to him to understand what excellent guest relations could mean. Yes, the rooms are a little small (but thats Manhattan style), the bed was very comfortable and the pillows were soft. Being a new hotel, we loved that the bed linen was new, the rooms were clean, and everything was working just fine.Dont expect a delightful breakfast cos its just bread and cheese, though food connoisseurs may find it good. But you can hop across the corner to Cafe 28 (28th St and 5th Av) for some great breakfast options. If you are an Indian food fan, just walk down 27th St to Lex Av, and you'll find all the Indian restaurants there. Try Bhatti or Dhaba, for some authentic Indian food. They have an excellent value lunch option either to go or seated.Coming back to The Mave, the hotel is very promising and it will be interesting to go back once they fix small things here and there, like the elevator, seating in the lobby and breakfast. We would love to stay at The Mave on our future trips to NYC and would highly recommend it to all.Overall, a great experience if you love to be in the heart of Manhattan, and stay at a new property, with excellent levels of guest relations and customer service.Enjoy your trip.Regards,Shefali and Ashish"
28,1949,"Aug 18 2009 	Best hotel staff in NY	This small boutique hotel in the Flatiron district was exactly what we were looking for. It was inexpensive, clean, and centrally located. We arrived from the west coast at 6:30 am after a red eye flight looking very weary and red eyed. We expected to leave our luggage and wander aimlessly until we could check in but to our surprise we were allowed to check in early and get into our room! This was so incredibly appreciated and absolutely saved our day. We were able to get a few hours sleep, shower up and get out and enjoy the city. Some reviewers have commented (complained) about the shower but we did not experience any problems. I suppose if you point the hand held shower head directly outside the shower curtain the bathroom floor would get wet. I have also read complaints about the one working elevator which is still the case as of 8/14 but the positives of this hotel out weigh this minor inconvenience. The best feature of The MAve is definitely the hotel staff! They are all so friendly, helpful and accommodating that we would stay here again in a heartbeat. We stayed in room 606 and while the room is small, it is very functional with a large closet and comfortable bed. There was a bit more street noise than others have commented on but we weren't in NY for peace and quiet.There is a diner 2 doors down that does a basic breakfast/lunch, great for a quick bite. The Shake Shack is just around the corner and does make an excellent burger! (not sure its better than In n Out but worth a trip) There is also a street cart across the way that is excellent for late night pick me ups! Get the chicken and rice! We saw quite a few taxi drivers and police eating from there. That's always a good sign! Also, a 24 hour hair salon on the corner."
29,1949,"Aug 18 2009 	Exceeded Expections	We LOVED this hotel. Highly recommend it. Our room was small(but what Manhattan room isn't) but it was clean, cool &amp; comfortable. The shower was hot and the bed was comfy. The staff went out of their way to accomodate any request, even giving us an umbrella on a rainy day. Only one elevator right now, but we only had to wait over 5 min. one time, and it was never crowded. They said the other one should be running soon. Great location, 3 subway entrances close by. Madison Sq. Pk is close and there is a Shake Shack there that is AMAZING! Our fav. building, the Flat Iron bldg is at the corner of Madison Sq. Pk and is a must see. We walked and took the subway everywhere. We are already planning our next trip and we will definitely stay at the MAve!"
30,1949,"Aug 17 2009 	GREAT place in Manhattan!	Awesome local, customer service, and accommodations! highly recommended!Sushi next door (Twist) was excellent and Cafe 28 around the corner was cheap and amazing (breakfast, lunch, dinner etc)"
31,1949,"Aug 16 2009 	Excellent Hotel Great service Great location	If you are looking for a nice and cosy place to stay in NY far away from the noisy Times Square ..this the place.A great boutique hotel , a skilled staff making you feel at home ,a great location between Union square and Empire State To make the long story short , we stayed at this hotel twice , in July and in August when we ended our trip in the US and we really enjoyed our stay !!!We definitely recommend that hotel either leisure or businessA big thank to Aneta and Joe and of course to all the staff . We surely come back in the near future.Anat , Patrice , lee and Guy"
32,1949,"Aug 10 2009 	Solid hotel good value.	The hotel had only been open for three weeks prior to my stay and there were certainly some teething problems (only one SLOW elevator working, room door was difficult to open, etc) but none of these were too serious or annoying. The staff members were exceptional. I booked only the day before and got a good deal ($160) but I also got the smallest room (the &quot;Urban Full&quot;). Although tiny, the room was set up well and I had no major problems moving around. I cannot imagine, however, having two people in there. If you're a couple, book the next biggest room, at least. All in all, a great option for midtown. Affordable, near the subway and buses, some good shops near by, clean, fantastic service."
33,1949,"Jul 29 2009 	SmallNoisyLousy Breakfast	If you book through Hotwire or Priceline they basically punish you and give you the tiniest,noisiest room they have.One positive was the service all the desk clerks etc where very nice.They called as soon as we got to are room and ask how everything was i said i booked a room for 2 adults and this room was barely big enough for 1 ,They said well you booked through Hotwire and nothing can be done so i said we got the 'Hotwire' room she laughed and agreed .The bad thing about it was I only saved 10.00 off normal price.Bed was a double and when 1 of us stood up the other had to sit on bed so there would be room The room was that small and I don't mean NYC small I mean closet small.breakfast was weird...goat cheeses and hard bread.Construction all night right in front of hotel.. if the air wasn't on we would have never got any sleep in fact people were complaining at front desk when we were leaving in morning and they were sending them to another hotel.Elevator was soo slow."
34,1949,Jul 23 2009 	Excellent Customer Service	I had the chance to stay at this hotel on opening weekend and could not have asked for a more pleasant experience. The way the staff treated us you would have thought we were their only guests. From excellent restaurant reccomendations to always being ready to make reservations for us I had an incredible experience at this hotel. The rooms felt like home and the decor was great!
35,1949,"Jul 22 2009 	Small Tasteful Solid Home Base for a Manhattan Trip	My fiancee and I also went on a 7 day trip to NY and took a chance on the newly renovated MAve. We had an 8th floor room, so basically street noise was minimal except for the occasional honking horn. The area around the hotel is good for walking - pretty much a daytime business crowd, very few clubs. We were ok without having a refrigerator. The hotel is very easy to access and is a good location for seeing Manhattan - near to important attractions (the ESB, Flatiron, Union Square, Madison Square, are all in walking distance, and the Museum of Sex is down the block!). The staff was uniformly wonderful to work with - everyone was universally friendly and tried very hard to accommodate our travel plans. We were always welcomed back when we returned to the front desk. It is obvious that the building itself is a work in progress - one elevator runs slow, the other is out of commission. We had a small problem with the half-wall of glass and the water coming out of the shower - the water surged from the shower head and splashed past the half-wall on to the floor in front of the toilet, leaving fairly messy wet towels and floor. The rooms are small by CA standards but average for Manhattan. We did not have any problems with the card lock or privacy lock, they worked perfectly the entire time. We also had a flat instead of a fitted sheet and that bothered me to the point that I slept straight on the mattress. My fiancee could live with it but the sheet was always bunched up in the morning. TV was great, AC was great, furnishings were good looking and adequate to hold out stuff. We would stay if we could get the same introductory rate, but we've heard that once the hotel gets going, the prices will go up. We like to try many areas anyway. We ate out and wandered NY most of the time and never used the Italian restaurant, Olana, or the breakfast (jet lag :-) Good place for the Flatiron district.Some more tips: Go to Cafe 28, catacorner to the MAve on 28th, a great place to get not only deli stuff but also fruits, sushi, chips, drinks, etc. Also, walk down to Mad Square Block (two blocks south) and find the Shake Shack around 2:30 to 4:00 pm. Get a shake, a hamburger, cheeseburger, or double stack if you are daring, and take it to go back to your room. We had lunch on the bed and it was fantastic."
36,1949,"Jul 17 2009 	Overall pleasant experience	My partner and I took advantage of the 3 nights for 2 deal this month at the Mave. We too were greeted by a doorman and friendly faces at the front desk. Unfortunately, when we arrived at 4:30pm (check-in is 3:00pm) our room was not yet ready, however the staff was very accomodating and brought us next door for complimentary drinks at Olana - thankfully... since there is no where to sit in the lobby area.The room was very clean, trendy, and comfortable (small though - but common for NYC). The bed was very cozy and big! Loved the art work and furniture. The only downer(s) were that the mini fridge had not yet been installed and we were unaware the room would not have a bath tub (only shower). The shower was fun and new-age style, however if we left the bathroom door open the fire alarm would go off. In addition since the shower barrier is only half-way the water went all over the floor - so don't leave anything on the bathroom floor and I would recommend not to put towels down b/c it just makes more of a mess. The H2O products were nothing special.It was dissappointing that the following day when we arrived back at the hotel at 6:30pm to relax before going out to dinner to find that our room had not yet been cleaned. The cleaning staff said we were next, which was only mildly irritating, but that there is no where to go to wait it out (b/c the lobby has no seating). We had to meander around the stairs for 10 minutes.The hotel was exceptionally quiet for NYC, which was great, however the wood shade over the window really didn't block out the light from the office building across the street. When asked how our stay was going - this was mentioned and they provided complimentary eye-shades which really helped. The room next door had a very creaky door which got annoying after a while, b/c the guest seemed to go in and out every 5 minutes, but after they checked out and no one checked back into that room - it was fine.Since the hotel is new they are still working out a few bugs such as the elevator, of the two only one was working and very slow, but this will be fixed soon. The lobby was very elegant, but seating is absent and necessary.Personally, I did not like the artisan breakfast except for the coffee (yum). For the hype they give it you would think it to be spectacular. Of the three mornings we went down, all 3x I had to ask for plates and napkins, one day they ran out of bread before we came down at 9:30am, the other day we went down at 9:00am and only a few crumbles of cheese were left, and on a different day someone must have forgot to pick up the fantsy jelly b/c Shop Rite was the brand for the day with the price tag right on top of the jar $1.79 lol. I firmly believe they should have provided in addition to the artisan breakfast some fresh fruit (bananas and apples) and some fresh juice (OJ). The breakfast got boring after a day. Add some fruit, juice, peanut butter, bagles and cream cheese and that would suffice for a great addition to the fresh baked bread and cheese.Overall, the staff was extremely accomodating and helpful always asking how we were and how our stay was. They would do their best to make a situation better. Customer service was 100%. We would stay there again (hopefully with the bugs worked out)."
37,1949,"Jul 15 2009 	The Mave was an excellent hotel and a great location - new is nice!	The Hotel was excellent - a great deal (3 nights for price of 2) and super clean. The staff are really great, young and responsive. The hotel is in a GREAT location. Corner of Madison and 27th, close to Madison Sq. park and easy wealk up or down town.Still a few bugs to work out around room service and an elevator (1 of 2) still needs service. Definitely would recommend and would stay again."
38,1949,"Jul 14 2009 	Great Service!	A girlfriend and I stayed here for a girlfriend getaway trip during The MAve's opening weekend. We were quite impressed with hotel. The lobby is quite tastefully decorated and helps to create an atmosphere of a luxury hotel. We stayed in a room with 2 double beds. It was on the small side which is to be expected in New York. The best way to describe the room was simple luxury. The beds were comfortable with a nice clean bathroom. One nice feature in the room are hardwood floors. The location of the hotel is quite conviently located in a nice non-touristy neighborhood. It is a $5 cab ride to many neighborhoods for shopping and nice restaurants.The best part of our stay was the staff at The MAve. We arrived quite late in the evening exhausted after numerous delays in getting there. The staff helped us find a fantastic French-American restaurant nearby that was open late and delicious! Over our stay, the staff helped us with everything from getting us reservations at one of the more trendy restaurants in town to providing a Blackberry charger. The staff made us feel as though we were staying at the best hotel in town."
39,1949,"Jul 13 2009 	Brand New Very clean great customer service	We booked the MAve on expedia.com after searching for a moderately priced hotel in Manhattan. The hotel is brand new, so the rooms are in perfect condition, they are really clean, and have tv with loads of channels to watch as well as free wireless internet. The location is in Midtown and is close walking distance to the Empire State Building, and only a small cab fare to time's square and macy's etc. The staff are friendly and provide a great service. We would stay here again..."
40,1949,"Jul 13 2009 	Excellent NYC Experience	Fantastic experience from very beginning to very end!!! As soon as my boyfriend and I arrived, we were greeted with big smiles and friendly staff. We walked into a bright and inviting reception area where we were taken care of immediately. The staff was very helpful in recommending good restaurants and jazz clubs (which we inquired about). The also helped us choose a Broadway show according to our tastes and make reservations for tickets.Our room was clean, bright and comfortable. There is nothing like sleeping a brand, new plush bed. It was super comfortable. The bathroom was very clean, the shower had great water power, and had the best H2O products! The towels were also very clean and soft. There was good closet space and good cabinet space. The AC unit very quickly cooled the room without much noise.In the mornings we enjoyed the complementary artisian breakfast! It was SO fresh...the bread, the cheese, the coffee....it was such a nice treat! I wish I could have a breakfast like that every morning!"
41,1949,"Jul 13 2009 	Great value for the money	I stayed for 9 nights at the MAve, starting on the opening weekend. Brand new hotel, with two points still to be finished: the elevators and the lobbyGreat room: all the furniture brand new, as well as the bathroomGreat service: all the staff is young and very politeVery central location: near the 28th subway stations, as well as touristic attractions (e.g. Empire State Building)"
42,1949,"Jul 8 2009 	Opening weekend at The MAve Hotel	We arrived at The MAve, which is on the corner of 27th and Madison Ave., to its gleaming floor to ceiling windows for the entire lobby. The white and red decor gives the lobby a nice calm feel. The doorman opened the door and all of the staff welcomed us to The MAve. When we checked in the staff were extremely helpful and very polite. We were also told that the hotel had not received their window shades, but we were provided complimentary eye shades\.Breakfast is provided every morning and consists of Artisanal cheeses, rustic breads, and honey. We never made it to breakfast, but when checking out, the spread looked exceptional. Part of the lobby is still under construction, but we were told a nice cafe or lounge would be built. This is a great idea because there is nowhere to sit in the lobby if you are waiting for a guest.Only one of the two elevators work at the moment, but since the hotel has a small number of rooms this wasn't a problem. The elevator had not been updated, but I gathered that they were working on the interior of the non-working elevator, and when they are finished they will start on the other.The hallways have been updated and everything was clean and sharp.When we opened the door to our room, it was clean and well decorated. It was very warm in the room, but we turned on the A/C and it was cool in no time. We reserved a Queen room, which was a little tight, but it was still comfortable. The bed was plush and inviting, and the hardwood floors gave the room a nice stylish modern look. There wasn't much on the white walls, but this also made the room feel less cluttered. All the furniture was modern and new. There was a desk, chair, dresser, and two end tables. The room has an IHome, 32&quot; HDTV, iron and ironing board, and a in window air conditioning. In the dresser there is a space for a refrigerator, so maybe they will be installing mini bars in the near future. The bathroom was clean with a nice size sink, big walk-in shower, and toilet. It was stocked with H2O bath products and had a complementary vanity kit. The towels could be better for this type of hotel. The water pressure wasn't great either, but it didn't take anytime for the water to get hot. One thing we really liked about this hotel is how quiet it is in the rooms. You can hear people coming and going as well as the elevator chime, but other than that it was extremely quiet and comfortable. The area is very safe and quiet, and I highly recommend a walk or picnic in Madison Square Park. We only had one issue with the room, and that was that our bathroom window was faulty. While taking a shower it fell out of it's frame and cracked. It was a jolt to the system more than anything, but we told the management immediately and were given a new room within minutes. We were also upgraded and all of the staff were very apologetic for our inconvenience. We were impressed with their expediency. Besides a few opening quirks, this hotel, is well on it's way to being a world class property. We would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in a quality hotel in New York City. The hotels rooms, decor, and extremely professional staff would rival that of the best hotels in New York."
43,1949,"Jul 8 2009 	Great accommodations and concierge service	My girlfriend and me stayed at The Mave for three nights their opening weekend to take advantage of the 3 for 2 nights special. There is nothing better than to be the first person ever to sleep on a super comfy hotel mattress. The room and the bathroom were super clean. No early knocks on the door from housekeeping - who wakes up early on a holiday weekend in the city anyways. From the lobby to the staircase to the room the facility screams trendy. The dcor and art combines both South Beach white lines and NYC contemporary sharp edges. It gets even better with young and area knowledgeable stuff that will go out of their way to recommend and arrange dinner reservations as well as club passes/guest list. During our stay we were able to check out Tenjune, Griffin, and 230 Fifth with no hassles by just mentioning 'The Mave&quot;."

1,1961,Bedbugs!!!!	I woke up with red welts on my back. They moved me to a new room and offered me free breakfast. That it!I have never experienced this before and sincerely hope it never happens to me again.
2,1961,"Great location. Fine rooms.	The location at 45th &amp; Madison is great if you need to get to Grand Central or if you've never been to NYC and want to be relatively close to things. I usually prefer to stay on the west side but got a room here for the Tues. of Thanksgiving Week for an excellent price using PriceLine. All NYC hotel rooms are small and this is no exception (chair at the desk touches the bed when not tucked under the desk) but the bed is excellent. There's a flat screen tv and the bathroom/shower etc. were just fine. Really short on closet space and not much room to store anything more than 2 carry on sized bags, but again, it's NYC and space is at a premium. The a/c worked fine for us unlike the other reviewer and the hotel was quiet. The bar is busy and the bartenders who seem a bit grumbly at first do warm up. I would definitely stay here again, especially at my priceline.com room rate. Unless you're looking for a luxurious big room in which to spend a lot of time, this will do just fine."
3,1961,Family and Fun	Its a great hotel and its located in a great area with nice views and a nice clean hotel
4,1961,"Great If you want to stay @ Midtown	This hotel can't be better located in NYC: 100 mts from 5 Av and 200 from central Station, you can go walking to Broadway and to the central Park!The service is not great, when we arrived having our room for three already booked and paid they wanted to give us a smoking room or a 1 bed room for three.... after talking some time they gave us what we have paid for!The room was comfortable and clean. If I come back to NYC I won't stay @ midtown but if I had to....I would go back to roosevelt for the price benefit value."
5,1961,"If you're looking for a reasonably clean hotel experience this is NOT for you.	Although I read some bad reviews about The Roosevelt, I thought I would give it a try considering its location and what I thought was a reasonable deal at the time from Priceline.My room was terrible. The entrance and lobby look decent enough, but my room as small and extremely dirty. The curtains were moldy, no, not the shower curtains, but the drapes in my room! I'm not surprised because the the room was very stuffy and humid. There is no thermostat, just an ancient wall fan with &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;warm&quot; options, which by the way, is very loud. Also, the mirror hanging on my bathroom door was covered in greasy white spots (I still have no idea what it was)... Disgusting! What kind of cleaning staff doesn't wipe down mirrors? The carpet was worn and dirty and the bathroom smelled very dank. The tub was old and had deep scratches across the surface. Worst of all, my bed smelled like urine... I am NOT exaggerating here. To top things off, something in the room aggravated my allergies and I was up sneezing and sniffling all night. Did I mention the view, or lack thereof? The only good thing about this place was the location. I thought I got a good deal on Priceline, but I would not stay there again even if someone paid me. Frankly, I expect more from a 3.5 star hotel. I wouldn't mind the small room and paper thin walls, especially because this is an old hotel, but management should make an effort to make their rooms reasonably clean..."
6,1961,"quality vrs price I would give it a F F F F	Do not use the concierge for broadway tickets. We were charged double the price. There is no comp of anything. The room is antiquated, analog tv, tiny, tiny bathroom. No coffee in room but may purchase @ restaurant for $4.50 a cup. I will never stay there again. A/C was unsat, hole in carpet.Lobby and location was great.jerryenmon@yahoo.com"
7,1961,"Nov 26 2009 	Great location for 1st timers!	Looked for ages for a hotel in an ideal central location in NYC, and The Roosevelt is definitely it! Right next to Grand Central Station if you want the subway, 4 blocks from Times Square if you're walking, i dont think i could of picked a better location. Only time i was in the hotel was to sleep, so i will say the bed was lovely, big and soft! and if i was to pick a problem it was that our room looked out on to 45th street and on the thursday night it was soooo noisy - rubbish tracks all night long - but over the weekend it was not as bad. If you like elegant, grand, big hotels (I'm talking about the reception!) and if you dont mind your rooms simple, and your bathrooms small - and i mean small theres no space for your toiletries girls! - then this hotel is brilliant :D"
8,1961,"Nov 23 2009 	Best location in Mid-Manhatten	My sister &amp; I just returned from NYC. We stayed at the Roosevelt--GOOD CHOICE!! Prior to our visit to NYC, we heard about the&quot; bed bug&quot; scare, so we decided to call &amp; inquire about it before our visit. We were assured at that time there was not a problem at the hotel. The gentleman we spoke with was very kind &amp; informative. He also upgraded our rm. to the hospitality suite-at no extra charge. We were not disappointed when we arrived. The rm. was everything that was promised &amp; more { with no bedbugs} The location was the best- we were within walking distance to almost everywhere we wanted to go. Can't wait to go back. Hope to stay in the same rm."
9,1961,"Nov 23 2009 	Relaxing and comfortable stay	My husband and I stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel for 5 nights and I can honestly not fault it at all. Its in such a great location being 1 block from 5th Avenue and right on Madison Avenue. The room was spotless and quite spacious, contrary to what I have read previously about 'box rooms'! The staff were more than helpful especially as the hotel was extremely busy. Would definitely go back."
10,1961,"Nov 18 2009 	The Roosevelt Hotel	3.5/5+In the heart of NY!+Clean Rooms, comfortable beds-Very small rooms-Expensive -Expensive charges (wifi, roomservice etc)"
11,1961,"Nov 17 2009 	Okay hotel.	I stayed here from 11/15 to 11/17 on business. The hotel is worn, but clean. The rooms were nothing special, but the bed was comfortable. The hotel was very busy, and the bar was busy each evening. For a business trip it was fine, although the internet was slow, and the location was great. I would not stay here for a vacation, though."
12,1961,"Nov 14 2009 	what can I say a so-so hotel	I stayed one night at this hotel for a business meeting. Location is really good, a short walk to major attractions. Room is small and old as expected, what surprised me is that there is no free umbrella for hotel guests to borrow, ( you need to pay for borrowing an umbrella). I guess there is no service to expect for a $200 per night hotel. What can I say, it's New York. If it's for pesonal trip, I'd rather stay in Financial District area, hotels there are much more updated and reasonably priced."
13,1961,"Nov 13 2009 	ALMOST PERFECT!!	I travelled to the Roosevelt on the 2nd November with my boyfriend. After reading some of the negative comments on here I was quite honestly dreading our stay but from what I experienced the hotel definatly has more pros than cons.When we arrived at the hotel check in was quick and professional. I asked if it would be possible to get an upgrade and was given a suite free of charge which was huge!! The lobby area is beautiful and spotless. The rooms are dated and although the maids came every day to clean there were little things that let them down. Our shower head was loose there was a plug sockett hanging from the wall and there were some blinds in the dressing area that were covered in dust. On the positive side the bed was really comfy we had 2 plasma tvs one in the bed area and one in the living room area and nice comfy sofa.From what we experienced the service at the hotel was 2nd to none every request we had was delt with in a proffsional and friendly manor and quickly too, My boyfriend forgot his razor so the hotel arranged for some complimentry disposables to be brought to the room including shaving foam! The doorman was always on hand to flag down taxis and on our last day the hotel stored our luggage for us without any issue. We only ordered room service once and was delicious!! as with most hotels it was a little pricey but when you compare it with New York prices it's not that different really!!The location of the hotel is FANTASTIC!! we walked everywhere!! It's 2 mins away from Grand Central Station, about 10 mins from times square and The Empire State Building and Rockerfeller Centre are a short distance on foot. It's just on 5th Ave so all the shoppings on your door step and it took about 15 mins to walk to Maceys and 20 mins to Bloomingdales. The only time we took a cab anywhere was to get down to Battery Park for the Ferry to Liberty and Ellis Island.All in all the hotel is definalty worth a visit if you get a bargain. It's classic dated style was fine for us but if you like modern contempery hotels with wow factor rooms it's probably not the place for you. We're quite easy going but I can see for more fussier travllers how the rooms could be a sore point however I can't see how anyone could fault the service."
14,1961,"Nov 8 2009 	great choice for the great deal I got on priceline	My husband and I were determined to find a decent hotel (3*) for under $200 a night for our November 4-7 stay in NYC, and we found it at the Roosevelt. Like the others who've commented here, the lobby is still a gem after all these years. Really, really beautiful. And like the others who've commented on the rooms, we weren't overly impressed. BUT, and this is a big but....the room was clean, functional and the bed was comfortable. At the end of the day, that's really all I care about. Yes, the toilet had to be flushed two, three times. Yes, the room was bare, fairly small, had no coffeemaker or mini fridge, the curtains over the AC unit were dirty and needed washing...but again, the major stuff was fine. Everyone we came into contact with was very pleasant, even went out of their way for us. So keep in mind, the few customer service glitches you are reading here are far outnumbered by the good or excellent service received by the hundreds of people who stay in this hotel and don't leave a review. I would recommend this hotel, unless you want upscale accomodation and are willing to pay for it. P.S. You can get free wi-fi in your room if you have AT&amp;T as your cellphone service provider."
15,1961,"Nov 8 2009 	Great Stay at Roosevelt	We loved the Roosevelt. Walking distance to Times Sq, U N buildings, and the Empire State building. Our room was clean and quiet and the bed was very comfortable. The foyer was gorgeous and took you back in time to another glamorous era. Lifts were great and quick. Great price. We went from here to stay in Greenwich Village for a few nights. A great combination of places to stay in NY"
16,1961,"Nov 8 2009 	37 bucks for a club sandwich??? What the...	There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of hotels in NYC and this one is not the one you should stay at. Rooms are tiny, rooms have absolutely no view (I stayed on the top floor--should have had a view of something), food is 4x more expensive than what it should cost (a club sandwich cost me $37), and the internet should be free (it's $15/day. I could go across the street to the coffee shop and get free internet or I can stay at the Roosevelt, pay $300 to stay the night and still have to pay $15 to use the internet.). The bellhops beg for tips and the waiter who delivered my room service practically stole the tip i gave him because he did not tell me he my room service bill already included an 18% gratuity and a $4.50 &quot;service charge&quot;. Do not stay here unless you have some extra cash you just want to throw in the trash."
17,1961,"Nov 7 2009 	The place to be in NY	If you're hitting Manhattan and traveling to New York for leisure and shopping, The Roosevelt Hotel offers excellent location and good accommodation. Strategically walking distance from Grand Central, Times Square, Broadway, Empire State, Rockefeller, Central Park and lots of shopping places. The price of accommodation is considerably cheap considering it's rated 3.5 stars. The room is also spacious, considering it's in Manhattan. If you're traveling in groups of 4, staying in this hotel is a lot better option than staying in b&amp;b or hostel."
18,1961,"Nov 3 2009 	Great hotel - don't worry about the bad reviews	Stayed at the Roosevelt for four nights; was slightly concerned at the mixed reviews but am very pleasantly surprised - front-desk staff were great, room is large and in good shape. Good value for money Concierge staff were as good as it gets - Christine helped me with a number of issues and is a credit to the hotel. As long as a I can get a reservation I know where I'll be staying in NYC in the future."
19,1961,"Nov 3 2009	Great Location... But Hotel Needs A Complete Renovation	Having read many mixed reviews on the Roosevelt I was quite unsure what to expect when we arrived at the hotel. We stayed at the Roosevelt for 5 nights and booked a standard double room, but sent an email to the hotel requesting a room with two double beds. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a nice open airy lobby with fresh flowers on the table and smiles at the door from the bell boys, however no one offered to take our luggage for us. When we got to the check in desk, the staff were friendly and helpful but had somehow messed up the booked and stated that we were only booked in for 3 nights, however when she checked the system again she realised she was looking instead at a reservation in 2010 (very strange I know, and I hope they havnt got us booked in for then!) It was rectified quickly and she apologised and we were given a room on the seventh floor with a view of the street on Madison Avenue. The rooms are a very good size, and the beds are quite comfy however they do not know how to make a bed properly and do not have bedding that actually fits the beds! The wallpaper as many have described and the decor of the rooms is somewhat tired and does have the look of nursing home style! There was a nice TV with cable channels and an air conditioning unit however we didnt touch it! The bathrooms were by far the most tired feature of the rooms, with the shower head not stuck to the wall properly and a bath that would not hold water for any length of time as well as the sink as the plug allowed it to drain. We didnt experience any of the 'brown water' cases as others suggested and always had hot water.There are 6 lifts in the hotel, but you can be waiting a little time for them. The longest we had to wait for one was 5 mins and this was on our last day. We never eat in the hotel, tried breakfast their once at the Starbucks, would not recommend it, but good if you have no idea where to go on your first day. There is if you are unsure where to eat on your first night, a great Italian restaurant called 'Naples 45,' which is reasonably priced and great food! Overall the hotel did what we needed it to do. We got the hotel at a great price on Expeida, but if I had paid the 1300 the room would have cost if I had booked direct with the hotel, then I would not be happy. We were hardly in the hotel much only to sleep and come back to in the afternoon for a rest, so if that is all your looking for and you get it at a good price, then yes, the Roosevelt would be a fine option.... it was clean, and had all the amenities we needed, however if you are looking for something a bit more, and are bothered about the tired looks and stained carpets in the hall ways etc then I would look to stay somewhere else. If the hotel were to have a complete renovation then this hotel could be amazing! Just a bit of TLC is needed, but I think due to the sheer size of the hotel (1000+ rooms) it is too big for the staff to care for it, or for them to update it. eg. at the bell boys desk there were 7 members of staff all doing the same job when 3 could have done it easily. If you need a hotel that is in a great location with rooms that a comfortable and not bothered about eating there then the Roosevelt would be suitable."
20,1961,"Nov 2 2009 	an awful experience	My husband and I stayed in the Roosevelt hotel.We were on honeymoon and New York was our last stay. We regret booking this hotel. I cannot say one good thing about our time in the hotel/ Our room was like a match box. The sockets on the wall had all burnt marks on them. When I went to iron my clothes the iron fell apart and burnt myself. And it took 12 hours to get another one,even after explaining what happened and asking for one five times thoughout the day. The staff were very rude and very unprofessional.and no ways helpful.I did not expect to be treated like this especially on my honeyroom and I still feel very angry about my experience here"
21,1961,"Nov 1 2009 	Excellent Hotel	Recently had a 4 night stay, read many reviews on here and was concerend to the point of nearly cancelling. Glad i didnt, hotel was great, good location, friendly staff, nice size rooms and very clean."
22,1961,"Oct 31 2009 	Nice Hotel Great Location	We visited New York for the first time, and got a fair price on this hotel, and we didn't regret it at all. We had read alot of reviews, and alot of them we're very negative. But we we're very postiv suprised, by the service, from the checkin, to the room, that not was up to date, but ok, when you think of the age of the Hotel. Elevators worked fine, but expect a litlle waiting time, in the morning, when all people will check out at the same time. And best of all, the hotel is in the middle of all things in manhatten, 5 minuttes from Time Square, when you walk. So the greatest location, to a fair price :-)"
23,1961,Oct 26 2009 	Good hotel	We have nothing to complain about. Roomy room decorated in an american taste that is not correspondent with our own but I guess carpets are found in every NY hotel.
24,1961,"Oct 25 2009 	Okay if you get a great deal on the rate...	For a bid of $180 per night, Priceline put me at the Roosevelt for a 6-night business trip. And for that price, it was just fine, but there's no way I would pay the rack rate of $300+ per night to stay here. There was nothing horrible about it, and there was plenty that was good. My room was huge, with 2 queen beds and a huge walk-in closet. It was by far the biggest hotel room I have ever had in Manhattan. The employees were friendly and helpful. The location was good, just a few feet from Grand Central and an easy walk to Times Square, 5th Ave, etc. But the place felt dated and creaky. The elevators were slow. The room air conditioning system made a lot of noise but not much cool air. The toilet flushed reluctantly and the shower drain was also cranky. One morning I took a shower and the water was warm, but would not get hot.And they charge $15 a day for wireless internet which I think is outright gouging.I would stay here again as long as I was paying under $200 a night, but not more than that."
25,1961,"Oct 25 2009	I would never recommend this hotel to anyone	My family and I recently stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel on a recent trip to NYC. I have stayed at several other 3 1/2 and 4 star hotels in Manhattan and I have never had such a bad experience. Upon check in we went to our room (which was a requested non-smoking room) and the room smelled of smoke. Not just a faint smell but an intense cloud of cigarette smoke. We complained to the front desk and or room was moved. Our new room had a problem with the hot water heater and even after maintenance &quot;fixed&quot; the problem we only got a hot shower one out of the three nights we stayed there. During our second night, my sister discovered a crusty yellow stain on the bed sheets. Overall I would never recommend this hotel to anyone who was visiting NYC."
26,1961,"Oct 25 2009 	Great customer service	i held a major black tie gala event at the Roosevelt and was very pleased with the customerservice and attentiveness of the staff. we wanted to have a 3 course meal served to over 300 people within one hour before the speaking part of our program. They executed this flawlessly, with attentiveness and courtesy. We did not feel rushed at all. When there were little issues, not one staff person said it was not their job to handle it. Everyone took responsibility to make sure this flowed. They know how to handle big groups and they do it with style."
27,1961,"Oct 22 2009 	Can't Beat This Location	Venerable hotel, opened 80+ years ago, but not rundown or seedy. Central location can't be beat; walking distance to Times Square, New York Public Library, more, plus easy public transportation. If I had to describe the hotel in one word, it would be Convenient. Paid $169 through Priceline."
28,1961,"Oct 19 2009 	Nothing Fancy But Great Location	Got a great deal from hotels.com for our trip in August. We had a double queen room - and the rooms were fine. Nothing fancy, but clean and large for NYC. The lobby is impressive and the hotel staff is not overly friendly, but helpful when pressed. The best part of staying here was the location. We didn't spend much time in our rooms, since we traversed the city from dawn to midnight, so for our purposes the Roosevelt was a good choice. Not five-star accomodations, but good nonetheless."
29,1961,"Oct 19 2009 	While the hotel has made some improvements I would not stay here	Although the entrance and lobby pay tribute to it's historic attributes, don't be fooled. The Roosevelt Hotel does not quite measure up to industry standards. I will recognize the bell staff and bar waiter for their attentive service - but it stops there. One of my colleagues rooms was not ready until 7:30pm in the evening and was told there was 'no place to change clothes'I was originally checked into an accessible room - with no fixed shower head. I asked to move but was told I'd have to wait another day even though there were plenty of rooms ready when I first arrived. I also had to re-pack all my belongings and store with the bell stand yet again - frustrating when you are in town for business. I was not alerted that I even had this room type to begin with. The pillows in the rooms have pointed ends on all fours - I woke up one morning with a large scratch down the side of my face. It was red and cut up enough for my colleagues to notice the next morning. Although food in New York is expensive, $30 for oatmeal and coffee seemed extreme.Maids do not knock before entering a room and they are quick to enter between 8am-8:30am so make sure you have your deadbolt locked. I also had trouble understanding the English from some of the employees- including two bell man.Elevators- it is impossible to get one to not stop at every floor. It seems every time you need to go to your room, they are always busy. Though this is trivial, it became rather annoying being in the 14th floor and having 5 stops or more every time I had to use one.Lastly when I was packing up the day before I left, I noticed a small 'pebble dropping' on the bed comforter. Not sure where that came from, but I'd rather not know. From what I've heard, this hotel had improved quite a bit from where it was last year, but by no means does it even compare to staying at an average Holiday Inn. Rooms were advertised at $299 per night, but I honestly I wouldn't hesitate spending the extra $30-$50 per night to get a much higher level of accommodation and service. You will thank yourself later."
30,1961,"Oct 19 2009 	Excellent Stay	Scored the hotel on priceline for $185 a night. They were very nice. They gave us a room with 2 double beds, a fridge and gave us a crib for our baby without any hassle. Room was reasonable size for NYC. Location is great."
31,1961,"Oct 18 2009 	Do not be fooled by the beautiful lobby the rooms are awfull and overpriced. Avoid unless desperate.	We were VERY disappointed with this hotel. After telling friends that we were finishing our 5 week tour of Europe with 3 nights in a Luxury New York hotel we arrived at the Roosevelt to find a hotel that is a shadow of its former self and incredibly overpriced. Our poor experience (after looking forward to our stay) started with our arrival. Not only did the 3 door staff not offer so much as a welcome or a smile, but they failed to even hold the door open for us or even offer to help us with our bags. The lobby was quite beautiful but that is where the class and attention to detail ends. After seeing the aged hallway to our room I instantly knew we had been ripped off. The room itself was old with worn carpets, peeling paint/wallpaper, a musty/moldy smell, ancient air conditioners and a bathroom from the 70's. This place needs a total overhaul. Not only were the rooms on par with budget accommodation, there was no wifi internet (just 2 computers in the lobby that were very expensive), no included breakfast"
32,1961,"Oct 17 2009 	Charming	Stayed with 2 friends on a five night trip to the city. Choose the hotel for its excellent, central location and I wasnt wrong. 2 mins from GC Stn, Park Ave, Times Sq all a 5-15 min walk.With almost 1200 bedrooms its a big hotel making a lot of money. Having read the other reviews most are accurate in that the hotel is charming 'old world' but has its flaws in the general upkeep and maintainence. If you can accept these 'niggles', its an all together good hotel.If anything, the rooftop bar is worth staying for....panoramic views with a 180 degree view of the city."
33,1961,"Oct 15 2009 	Charm and location but expect problems with the room	I've stayed here many times and I will return. But I've learned to check my expectations in the totally charming lobby. Good: Location, lobby and bar. Totally 'Old New York'Not so good: The air con has been on the heritage list since 1980 and hasn't been serviced since then. You'll complain and a totally charming service guy will make some soothing gestures. But it will continue to noisily blow air at room temperature throughout your stay.The wiring dates from the Roosevelt era. You'll try in vain to plug in your iPhone charger AND your laptop. And the $14.95 internet connection runs at the speed of Clinton era dial-up modems.The bathroom will have at least one of the following issues (and I've seen them all): no hot water, toilet won't flush; toilet runs constantly, tub won't drain.There will be sundry bits of room trim hanging.Do not order food here. Walk a block in any direction instead.But the beds are comfy, the staff are nice and pretend to fix your issues. And I'm a sucker for the 'Old New York' schtick. So I go back."
34,1961,"Oct 14 2009 	More cons than pros	Walked into impressive lobby and got checked in. Upgraded to a standard double which was an adequate size (cosy queen must be tiny!). Room is dated and in need of refurbishment. Bit smelly, but clean and tidy except for the odd exposed wire connecting the lamp into the wall and the bathroom door not closing properly. The air conditioning unit kept us awake for much of the first night. Tried switching it off and opening the window - but street noise was just as bad. Next morning requested that the air con unit was fixed. Had to complain again when we returned to the hotel later that afternoon as still not repaired. Engineer came up and replaced the unit within the hour. On last day checked out with no problem. Asked a member of staff if the hotel would look after the bags whilst we enjoyed our last day, he then proceeded to make 2 phone calls before passing us onto a colleague - rude. On returning to the hotel to collect the bags the doorman found one, but then I had to go into the room to find the other 2 as they had not been stowed together. All in all the hotel was not worth the money we paid. We have previously stayed at Club Quarters at The Rockafeller Center which put The Roosevelt to shame and was a fraction of the cost. Don't be fooled by the impressive pictures on the website - this needs to be refurbished!"
35,1961,"Oct 9 2009 	Nice location average hotel	Lobby is very nice, front desk &amp; staff not very friendly, but OK. Room is little small for a cozy double, double, OK bath. Grand central terminal right across the street, Time Square, Rockectfeller, United Nations withing walking distance. If you need breakfast go to &quot;Pizza shop&quot; at 5th Ave, then turn left, pretty good. NY always a nice place to visit this is our 3rd time in the city &amp; we still have a lot of places to go for next trip.On weekend door to Grand central is closed so you need to enter from Park Ave next to Michael Jordan Steak House."
36,1961,"Oct 8 2009 	great location	we recently stayed at the Roosevelt at 45 th and Madison . The location is great . Very close to Grand Central ,and Times Square . The rooms very large for N. Y . We had 2 queen beds. . with lots of room . The bathroom could use some freshing . The wall paper needs fixing The fitness room on the 2nd floor is open 24/7 , and free of charge .The staff were very friendly, and helpful. We took the bus to LGA for only $12.00. each .This sure beats a cab."
37,1961,"Oct 7 2009 	The Roosevelt - ManhattanNew York	Grand foyer....fit for royalty! Amazing location, pretty close to grand central station, time square, nbc and 5th avenue. Concierge and staff were friendly without being &quot;in your face&quot;. My only gripe: room was a little cramped."
38,1961,"Oct 7 2009 	Beware - do not go there.	I had the unfortunate experience of staying at this Hotel with a food and wine group. I was supposed to stay for four nights. I left after one! The security lock on the door of the room - when I finally got into it - was broken off, it looked as if it had been forced at some point, and the wood of the door itself was so rotten that it would not hold the screws when maintenance came to replace it. Basic amenities like a shower cap for instance where non existent. The quilt on the bed had been washed and the filling had gone lumpy. When I returned to my room later in the evening after supper there were strange people hanging around the corridors of my floor - obviously not going to or coming from the elevators. Then to top it all off when I awoke the following morning the entire room was without electricity!! The room was never serviced whilst I was there. My friends who were also staying awoke on their final morning to find they had no running HOT WATER.The staff were rude and could not care less - and forget about using the bellhops for luggage or getting cabs they did not want to know."
39,1961,"Oct 6 2009 	Nothing to offer but location!	Stayed for two nights with a large group in town for a food and wine event. Our room was labeled deluxe and was marginal at best. Small, with a stained and noisy air-conditioner, stained carpeting, questionable bedding, a loose bed frame that almost catapulted my husband to the wall, torn lampshades and a tiny, uncomfortable bathroom with a very hard to work shower control. I talked with two others in our group whose rooms were so bad (roaches in one, and no electricity in the other!) that they changed hotels.Sunday morning was impossible -- 15-20 minute waits for the elevator, with very long lines at the bell desk and front desk. Too bad this hotel has never had a lot of people scheduled to check out at one time before, so they would know how to staff accordingly!!!"
40,1961,"Oct 5 2009 	Worst Hotel I've Stayed in in NYC	I took my staff up to NYC for a show as part of a business trip and we booked 3 rooms for 2 nights. When I first visited their website I thought we had made a great selection considering the location and the pictures of the hotel - don't be fooled!The customer service at this hotel was non-existent. My first problem was trying to PAY for a room upgrade. I emailed them a copy of my CC and a CC authorization form - they acknowledged they got it. When I saw the card had not been charged I called to ask about the upgrade I was PAYING for. They snipped that I had simply made a &quot;request.&quot; I reiterated that no, I had submitted the authorization form for the charges. They said they didn't get it - despite the fact I have an email from them saying they did receive it. So I sent it again and they finally charged the card - 4 phone calls later. When I arrived at the hotel they tried to charge me AGAIN.One of my staff members woke up to find a cock roach the size of a mosaic tile on the bathroom floor. They called down to the front desk and someone came and &quot;removed&quot; it - but where there's one roach there are more....they moved them to another room.The next night there was a wedding and a big party of some sort going on. There were people in the hallways running up and down and screaming obscenities. People were obviously intoxicated. I understand it's NYC on a Saturday so I didn't pay any mind to it. HOWEVER, when a very rude security officer banged on our door when we were doing nothing but sitting and talking (no tv, no music playing and our group was sober) and told us they had had 2 complaints about us and that if we didn't stop laughing he would &quot;escort us off the property&quot; I was appalled. The staff member who answered the door was in tears. He made no apology for her being upset - he said he was doing his job and he would &quot;do it again.&quot;When I stepped into the hallway to go back to my room I could hear all the rooms around us with people talking and laughing. I do not understand why we were singled out. Much less, my other staff complained that the running up and down the hall that people were doing kept them awake all night. Security didn't seem to threaten to escort them off of the property.The next morning, it took us THIRTY minutes to catch an elevator. This hotel has over 1000 rooms and has 6 elevators! During peak times you're wait is atrocious! When we asked a staff member if we could use their elevator just so we could check out (we were on the 16th floor - luggage is not something we could drag down that many steps) they just shook their head and walked away. The rooms are TINY - smallest I've ever seen!Overall, I think this is probably the worst hotel stay I have had in a very long time. Stay somewhere else!"
41,1961,"Oct 2 2009 	Great Hotel Great Location Great Staff	Got a great price for Friday and Saturday night stay recently on Hotwire. This hotel is beautiful. Room was great, nice size, linens and pillows were plush. Water pressure in the shower was unbelievable and hot, that alone makes this a 4 star hotel in my book. Wonderful location, staff was happy and helpful. Bar in lobby had Hendrick's gin what more could you want?"
42,1961,"Oct 2 2009 	An oldie but a goodie	My friend and I were chuffed to be upgraded to a superior room upon arrival. The room was clean and the beds comfy and reception staff very friendly. Location wise it's great, being close to transport (Grand Central) and within walking distance of lots of attractions. The only downside for us was the lack of tea &amp; coffee making facilities - this one extra would have made it perfect. Also, I found the gift shop concession staff over charged me for some stamps by several dollars."
43,1961,"Oct 2 2009 	Great for the price. Central to everything.	Was in town for a trade tasting in Mid-town and chose the hotel for location vs. price without checking on TA first. We arrived early, checked in at the desk as the bellman had to check our bags for no rooms ready at that time. We returned several hours later to find a ling of 15 persons waiting to get checked in and was told that altghough we had 'checked-in' previously, we would have to get back in line and wait our turn to be assigned a key and room number. I found this unexceptible that the bellman had not been given a key for a room and that the bags were not checked into the room accordingly. Most top-notch hotels would have this as a standard mode of handling an early check-in when a room were not available. The upshot of my complaint to the bellman was a key which produced a handicap room which sufficed just fine. The room was clean and large enough if not a bit spartan. For the price and the location it all worked fine for this quick business trip. I'd return for a stay in the future."
44,1961,"Oct 1 2009 	grand entrance rooms weel below average	we stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in sept. hotel entrance was grand &amp; looked fantastic.Our first room was in a poor state, air conditioning unit was like an old tractor, stains on the carpet &amp; the bathroom was all black &amp; mouldy. we had to stay in that room overnight as no other rooms were available. moved to another room the next day and was a little better. No bath, just a shower but again the shower area grout was all black &amp; mouldy &amp; the toilet pan was cracked. Again no other rooms avail. One Bellhop was only intent on getting a tip even though the cases were still in the same place that i had left them. His atitude was terrible. On the good side the hotel is in a very good location in New york."
45,1961,Sep 29 2009 	Great Choice Great Deal Great Location	Upscale and within a minutes walk of Grand Central Station! Very close to 5th Avenue and within walking distance of Times Square. Very quiet and relaxing this hotel brings a new feel to the hustle and bustle of New York City. The service was excellent and the rooms were cozy.
46,1961,"Sep 29 2009 	Average	I recently traveled to New York on a business trip and stayed at this hotel. My room was kind of small, but it's New York and that's simply how most hotels are. The bed was fine, and I liked the LG flat screen tv. I had some problems with the shower, as the knob would have to be turned barely on and in the cold position to produce hot water. The AC unit worked fine when on high, but was extremely loud when placed on low. There was no fridge or coffee maker in the room.I noticed catching an elevator was consistently a problem, especially after 9am. Be ready to wait 5 minutes just to get an elevator. The location is pretty good which is a bonus. But all in all, there are better places to stay in the same general area. I do not think I'd spend my own money to stay at this hotel."
47,1961,"Sep 28 2009 	Large rooms close to everything helpful staff will defiantly go back	I stayed at the Roosevelt for 5 nights at the end of our 3 weeks US holdiay from Australia. There were three of us in the room my husband and my mum, the room was exceptionally large (larger than I expected for New York) clean and looked better than expected (nice white sheets etc) the rooftop bar is beautiful, the staff were friendly and helpful, close to everything no need to take a taxi you can either walk or take the subway (subway was so convenient and cheap!) would recommend this hotel to anybody and will defiantly stay there again."
48,1961,"Sep 28 2009 	Location Lobby + Front Desk Staff Won Me Over""	I've been a NYC girl for years and I still find the lobby jaw-dropping. It is gorgeous, and the location is second to none for Manhattan - about as perfectly central as you can be. Doris at the Front Desk is spectacular and took great care of me. The bartenders at the lobby bar are charming as heck (they've been at it a while and the jokes don't get old ... ha) The usual cons: The rooms are small (welcome to NY); the elevators are slow (welcome to NY); the heat and AC are from the dark ages (welcome to NY); the only thing they could really legitimately use is regrouting of the showers. But the rest is fine, and priced incredibly reasonably considering that it's sitting on 45th + Mad."
49,1961,"Sep 27 2009 	Good for the price!	Overall for what we paid this hotel was great. We got a special summer deal for a 4 night stay - we paid $139 a night plus tax. That included a voucher for breakfast per day (value of $10 a day). We had a non smoking twin on a high-ish floor (can't remember which one!) that overlooked the street to the front of the hotel. The beds were big and comfy, the room was clean, and the bathroom was good. yes its a bit worn at the edges and the lifts are really slow but lets face it you're in NYC! who wants to spend ages in the room! all you need is a clean comfy room to grab some rest before another great day shopping and sightseeing! The lobby is amazing too - very old grandeur!If i could get the same price again i'd definately stay here. its really close to grand central, a 10 min walk to times square and overall a good stay for the price."
50,1961,"Sep 23 2009 	this hotel is infested with bed bugs	please beware. we stayed at the Roosevelt and brought home a house full of bed bugs! we are infested and have to throw out all of our matresses and spend thousands of dollar to replace them and well as having out whole house treated, it is Horrible. do not stay there!"
51,1961,"Sep 22 2009 	Cockroaches in the bathroom	This was one of the worst hotels I've ever visited. Truly awful. We were first shown our room which was on a &quot;non-smoking&quot; floor, but the entire floor (5th) reeked of smoke. It was also so tiny we could hardly walk around the bed .We requested an upgrade and had to pay $80/ night for the pleasure. The decor of the rooms is what I would call &quot;nursing home style&quot; with what seems to be plastic pink walls, not even wallpaper. The light bulbs have all been replaced with flourescent energy saving ones - which is a nice gesture for their wallets and the environment, but there's a happy medium that they did not strike. These were bottom of the barrel and the lampshades weren't big enough to cover them, so the overall effect was of an interrogation room. There was no cable TV, so we had fuzzy TV reception. There's no coffee maker, so we paid $54 for a medium pot of coffee and two orders of toast in the morning.And as the title suggests, the piece de resistance was the 3-inch cockroach that scuttled across the institution-like bathroom floor and clung to the plastic shower curtain. Luckily my boyfriend was with me because killing cockroaches isn't something I like to do before important business meetings. If you can do anything at all to avoid this hotel, please do. It's horrid."
52,1961,"Sep 17 2009 	Excellent location!	The Roosevelt has an excellent location in the midtown of Manhattan.All at our fingertips!You can find the greatest places by foot. One nasty thing was my bedroom had no fridge which was an absurd if I payed more than 300 dollars for a room. The lobby of the hotel is pretty,well decorated!I really enjoyed my stay there!"
53,1961,"Sep 16 2009 	Tired Old Lady	I've stayed here many times for business a few years ago--mostly because of the location and value. Nothing special too close to my office to beat. I stopped because many other hotels midtown NY soon had better rates and more comfortable rooms. I tried again and--while the hotel has a wonderful history and is a beloved friend to many, I'm sorry-- she is a tired old lady. Everything is worn, the front desk staff (at least those I experienced, granted it was an after midnight arrival) cool and dressed in cheap suits, the elevators worn out, hallways depressing and then the room--with its torn lampshades, extension cords and rattling old AC unit--for what? $389 a night? Old bathrooms, just plain defunct and worn out. I hear some rooms were rennovated--my advice is to keep going. I don't see the value or reason to stay in the crowded rusty old relic. If you're coming to NY--don't buy in to the hype of this hotel. Meet someone under the clock--and they go check in somewhere else."
54,1961,Sep 13 2009 	Nice renovation!	This grand old hotel has been restored beautifully. Great stay!
55,1961,"Sep 12 2009 	I am sorry Roosevelt staff I seem to have disturbed your day...	trip - Business. Location handy and pretty centralNice foyer Overall stay not so great: o Breakfast below average $25 - fruit flies coated fresh fruits, if its not included in the rate then there are lots of great places nearby that are worth the trying instead. Disappointing if you are on business since you need the convienence of the hotel breakfast. o Rooms - clean but very SMALL, and noisey. (not enough room to open suitcase easily) bathroom exceptionally small and a lack lustre shower. If your over 5.6ft forget a comfortable shower, lots of crouching required - and I have a slim build! Noisey - The AC unit was LOUD....hotel unable to do anything about it.....sorry I meant couldn't be bothered  o Spoke to reception who said no rooms were available unless I was willing to pay an upgrade! (which means empty rooms existed...just not for someone whose booking and monies thay already had!!!)not what you would expect from this level of hotel found the attitude unhelpful - you could see my problem - they need to prewarn guests about the exact size of their 'cozy' rooms and that they are noisey and those that are not fit for purpose should be made part of a 'special deal' not a standard rate! Stayed a week - so surprised that another room was not available. On the whole - lucky to be on business and not pleasure (since this minimised the time drastically at the hotel) Next trip to NY having having stayed at the belevedre and sofitel will be looking to stay there instead, both similairish in location much better service and after the jet lag, sleepless in need of revival!!!! Its a long time since I have had to give a bad review to a hotel, disappointed to have to have done so today, if the hotel experience if part of your holiday / business experience then I wouldn't recommend this hotel.If you simply want a bed somewhere convienent and happy to tolerate noise, unattentive staff, slow lifts and pay a premium for the pleasure go-ahead.Personally, I felt as if I was a huge unconvience getting in the way of staff who simply were not there for customers.I read some of the favourable reviews and wondered wether there are two roosevelts that look the same ...and I had checked into the wrong one!!! since my experience was not relflected here at all.Also one of my collegues was triple charges on parking...."
56,1961,Sep 12 2009 	Roosevelt Hotel	The Roosevelt Hotel is a beautiful old hotel with a grand lobby. The rooms are small like many New York hotel. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The staff is polite and attentive. Only issue I had was with the slow elevator system. The Roosevelt is in a location  steps from Grand Central Station and just a few blocks from Time Square or the NY Public Library.
57,1961,"Sep 11 2009 	You have to stay in this hotel at least once in your life	You have to stay in this hotel at least once in your life.You will be disrespected by the rude and bad mannered porters at the door, particularly by an individual called Joe. He will not give you your luggage even if you are in a rush.You will have always something missing to be replenished in your room. One day it will be towels, next it will be soap and so on.You will experience bedbug bites even one week after you leave the hotel, yes, you read right, bedbugs!You will have to wait forever to get a lift.You will have to cruise different floors until you find a ice machine that works.You will not have the need to complain because nobody will listen to you.What I say, you have to stay at least once in this hotel, and then you will appreciate other hotels service even if they are regular or roadside motels. You will be really happy when you get back home and you will know if your skin react or not to bedbug bites or not."
58,1961,"Sep 9 2009 	Excellent loaction	Hotel is ideally located for many of the major attractions, lovely hotel one or two minor issues on the whole what you expect for a very busy New York hotel.Would happily recommend this hotel and even more important would def. stay here again"
59,1961,"Sep 8 2009 	Absolutely Perfect!! Extremely elegant hotel...	My husband and I stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel on Sept. 6th and 7th to celebrate our 25th anniversary. We couldn't have picked a better place! We loved this hotel from the moment we arrived. Everyone from the doorman, bell hops, receptionists to bartenders were extremely polite and helpful. They went out of their way to make sure we were satisfied and always asked if we needed anything when we entered the lobby area...which by the way, is very elegant...just beautiful. The ambiance is that of old world charm of the 20s era. The rooms ample size (our room was upgraded without us even asking and at no extra cost). The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms kept very clean. The doorman hailed cabs for us when we wanted to go downtown but given the location of the hotel, there is so much to do within walking distance. Very close to Times Square but far enough from the craziness, short blocks to Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedrial and Central Park is not far...location was perfect!! Plenty of shopping and eateries. Great room rates given the elegance of this hotel. Again the staff couldn't have been more accomodating. Visit Ninos a short walk at 39 W. 46th St. for breakfast...Owner Mike is a great guy. I can't type forever, but to sum it up in two words ...&quot;Absolutely Perfect&quot;."
60,1961,"Sep 6 2009 	Killer Location! Hotel is better than most for the price	It's Manhattan, so the room is pricey for what you get. The hotel is older. The room is tight and adequate. The bar is nice and the happy hour is convivial. I never ate at the hotel. Stay at this hotel for its proximity to Grand Central and the subway. We did lots of walking and sightseeing from the hotel. The location and its centrality is the reason for staying.Be sure to take advantage of the Grand Central Food Court in the basement of Grand Central. A gazillion choices! Also, take a moment in Grand Central to visit the Grand Central Market. Glorious fresh fish, cheeses, spices, vegetables, ready-to-eat deli food. All pristinely presented and beautifully lit. Bring the camera.I would stay at this hotel again. I loved it's proximity to transportation."
61,1961,Sep 1 2009 	What a great time.	I was visiting from LA. My room was a bit small but what do you expect from Midtown Manhattan? Met friends for drinks at the bar and the staff was wonderful. Would stay again for sure.
62,1961,"Aug 31 2009 	Fab Location!	Being a travel agent, I try not to rely a lot on reviews and try to experience the hotels or destinations myself. I will be honest in saying that the hotel is a little dated, but in a great location which makes up for everything that it is lacking. The staff were very friendly and wanted to help in any possible way. Will recommend this to friends and clients that travel to NYC and will come back myself!"
63,1961,"Aug 31 2009 	Perfect	I stayed here for two nights during my business trip. Room was fantastic, staff were superb and ever so helpful and professional. Couldn't ask for more from a hotel."
64,1961,"Aug 30 2009 	Faded elegance but okay	I booked 6 nights through Hotwire and got a good price, but was dreading the stay due to the negative comments here. However, when I arrived the reception staff were very pleasant and even put me into a larger room because I am a smoker - very unlike the smoking paranoia I have encountered so far in the USA. I declined the services of the bell hops on advice read here - don't be put off by the entrance stairs, as there is a lift on the floor at the bottom, where the shops are. The only service I used was the extravagantly priced wifi, $15 dollars for 24 hours. Otherwise I ate out and brought drinks back with me. As said elsewhere, the whole place needs refurbishment, especially the room doors on my floor, everyone of which had to be slammed in order to close it, so one can imagine the noise. Location is excellent. For the price I paid, $129 a night, not bad for NY, but I wouldn't have been happy had I paid the full rate. Incidentally, I moved on to the Holiday Inn Express just a block over for 2 nights, as I got a ticket for the US Open so extended my stay - for the same price, I got free wifi, extensive cable TV and a free breakfast. Not quite as glamorous but better for me anyway."
65,1961,"Aug 30 2009 	Fantastic Hotel - great location.	After a long flight from Australia, I was just wanting to relax in a comfortable room and bed. I had read other reviews about the hotel ie small rooms, however I was pleasantly surprised. My room was quite large (it had 2 Queen size beds). I enjoyed relaxing in the bath. I thought the room was beautiful. The front desk staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. The hotel is in a great location - close to major tourist attractions. As a solo female traveller I felt safe and at ease. I will definitely stay here again. (I also liked the hotel gym - modern equipment &amp; free fruit to enjoy after a workout)."
66,1961,"Aug 29 2009 	Couldn't be better for that occasion!	Muito bom! Excelente localizao, prximo a Broadway."
67,1961,"Aug 28 2009 	Pretty darn good for the money	OK, I admit we got this hotel through a successful Priceline bid, and the joy of paying $125 a night for a midtown hotel may have given me a rosier outlook than I would ordinarily have had. All the same, I just can't understand the virtriol aimed at this place by so many reviewers. It was fine. Really, totally fine. We checked in early, asked for quiet rooms with 2 double beds and both requests were granted. The rooms were standard size, as clean as any hotel generally is, and nicely finished. A &quot;quiet&quot; room turns out to be one with a lovely overlook of the building's HVAC plant, but to me that' s infinitely better than listening to honking taxis at 3 a.m. I kept the fan on full blast and heard no noise at all from nearby rooms, although the hotel was fully booked up. The rooms showed minor signs of wear, like small stains in the wallpaper and an askew light fixture. These flaws were most noticeable in the bathrooms, where there was some mold in the grout and the porcelain tubs were worn. But c'mon, so what? Who doesn't have a little mold in the bathroom? The hotel was quite full and the staff was busy, but efficient and helpful at all times. The lobby, as others have mentioned, is fabulous: an over-the-top purple and green extravaganza that kept me hopefully looking out for Myrna Loy. We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants, order from room service or use the exercise room as we were out touristing all day, so I can't give an opinion on those, but the morning coffee from the bar was good and no pricier than the Starbucks. All in all, I'd have no hesitation in booking here again. You could do a lot worse in NYC."
68,1961,"Aug 28 2009 	Good Location charming public areas (bar/lobby) boring and drab rooms	We booked on expedia and got a room at the end of the floor, far from the elevator. The view was horrible (back alley, roofed courtyard,very industrial). We requested a change of room but they were unable to do it because of a wedding party. The room was larger than we expected and the beds were comfortable. Bathroom was tiny, with about 12in by 5in of counter space. THe tub wasn't dirty but didn't feel clean. The bathroom was old. They tried to make the room look regal but fell short and can be best described as drab. I suppose it is worth it if you're planning to just sleep in the bed. NO frills, no luxury don't expect more. The public areas such as the bar and lobby were lively and charming.The location is good, close to shopping. However the hotel did not ooze hospitality. For a frequent international traveler, I did not feel welcome and secure during my stay here. I was happy to leave this otherwise fun city."
69,1961,Aug 28 2009 	Location location location!!	The perfect location!! you are actually two or three block from every where you will like to go! Will always go there when back in New York!
70,1961,"Aug 27 2009 	Nice location staff friendly and helpful however the beds and room not perfect.	We were in NYC for my cousin's wedding- Aug 14-17. The wedding reception was in the Grand Ballroom, which was gorgeous. All the food was great. When we checked in about 7:45pm on Friday, Aug 14, our rooms were not ready and we had to wait about 45 minutes. The check-in staff did give us drink vouchers for our party to offset the wait. When we finally got up to our rooms, I was disappointed that the one my folks and stayed in (1235) had uncomfortably small beds (double bed) and the door's deadbolt slider did not look very secure. In fact, you could just about look through the hole through the door and it was not the peephole I was looking in! I did not complain to the front desk, since the hotel was sold out for the weekend and would not have been able to get something else. The bathroom decor, such as wallpaper was peeling off the wall. I still would recommend this hotel, because overall the experience was very positive due to the service we received. We were allowed to store our luggage on Monday for a few hours, which allowed us the opportunity to go to Grand Central Terminal (very close to the hotel), take the subway and hit Chinatown for lunch and shopping!!"
71,1961,"Aug 26 2009 	Great Deal Nice Hotel Would stay there again!	Staff was very nice and helpful. Our hotel room was upgrated as soon as we got there. Very nice, clean room, quite spacious for New York City. Hotel offered to store our luggage since we got there before check-in time. Couldn't ask for more. Location was amazing. Beautiful hotel. Beds were really comfortable. We would definately stay there again!"
72,1961,"Aug 24 2009 	could be a really nice place pity about bathroom	1st impression is great with a fantastic lobby (but you don't sleep there)we were upgraded to a bigger room (with 2 teenage girls); this room was fairly big with plenty of room, however the air con was very noisy and the bathroom was very shabby and needs a complete overhaul even the door didn't completely shut. we didn't mind that much as we only slept here rather than used it as a living quarters.the drinks in the bar were expensive ($15 for 2 beers) and bar staff were misrable.the location was good with deli's etc within 5 mins and times sq etc within 20 mins for walking.I wouldn't say it was bad but it definitely needs a refurb.I would have to describe the faults before recommending it."
73,1961,"Aug 24 2009 	Slow elevators	This hotel is in a great location and was very clean. The lobby area is beautiful. Our room was well-appointed with a huge king-size bed. The only problem was the very slow elevators. If you're going to a meeting, give yourself extra time or just take the stairs."
74,1961,Aug 23 2009	Fantastic Hotel	We checked into the Roosevelt hotel on Friday very quickly and went on to tour New York within a short time. The checkout was equally as quick. The room was very nice and the beds very comfortable. The location was across from Grand Central and easy access to the subway system or walk to Time Square. Our rooms were always cleaned by the time we returned. The nicely decorated lobby was comfortable and spacious and staff quite helpful.
75,1961,"Aug 21 2009 	Eh... has it's pros and cons	I recently stayed here for a wedding, with family. I will list the good parts of the hotel first:-good Manhattan location-beds are very comfortable-hotel lobby is gorgeous!-beautiful place for wedding reception-catered food (at the reception) was delicious- good people watching in the lobby!Now on to the not so great stuff:-No free wifi. It is $15 per 24 hours. There are some eateries down the street that do have it though.-Valet parking. (Ok, some may consider this a &quot;plus&quot;, but when you have a car full of people and stuff, and you not only have to pay for parking but tip the driver also... well, it didn't do it for me.)-Food/drinks are very very expensive. If you are on a budget, forget eating there! I think it was $15 for a bowl of oatmeal or something like that. $8 for a beer in the lounge.-Regular rooms are small. (I did have the opportunity to see a suite, and it was amazing!!) But 4 adults in a regular room with 2 beds is very cramped.-One staff member was very rude.-We had booked our room in early May, but they double booked our room, and it took them over an hour to find us a new room. After being in the car for over 6 hours, this was not pleasant. They also said they were upgrading us to a larger room, but that did not happen. We were given the wrong room again. Right after we got settled in, a couple was outside our door, confused, and said the room was theirs. They had to go back down to the front desk and figure that mess out.So I can't say I would personally recommend this hotel, unless you have big $$$ to stay in a suite. However, I would not say it was awful either. The reception was held there and was absolutely beautiful. But, if you expect an exceptional stay here, then expect to pay an exceptional price!"
76,1961,"Aug 21 2009 	Good Hotel! Great Location!!! Will stay again!	We had a girls weekend in NYC last weekend it was amazing! We stay at the Roosevelt and found it to be just what we were looking for. Checking in the lady was confused as to why two girls where sharing a double bed, (there were no rooms with 2 beds when we booked..) and she happily upgraded us to a King Size. Went into our room, you could tell it had been smoked in only if you had allergies, but for a historic hotel what do you expect, at one time you could smoke everywhere and Europe people still smoke everywhere (Gross but deal with it). Our room was clean, the bathroom had some mildew on the tile but it didnt really bother us to bad, again its an old hotel. The room was a good size for people who travel to do things, we spent a few hours on one of our afternoons and chill and watched tv, was fine. It was close to Grand Central, Time Square and if you wanted to go to Meat Packing District or Little Italy it was a less then $10 cab ride!!"
77,1961,"Aug 19 2009 	I won't stay there again	We stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel for 4 nights recently. Little things, when put together, added up to my disappointment. It was like an efficiency-expert who didn't care about customer satisfaction came in and told them how they could cut corners. Here goes:I'm used to free wi-fi in hotels... it was something like $15/day--maybe that's to be expected in all hotels in NYC? I don't know. Even so, I can see a couple of bucks, but $15 a day?There were stains on the carpets (milk?) and bedspreads (ink?) (not a huge deal I guess, if everything else is great, but I had higher expectations).No coffee maker in the room--I can't remember the last hotel I was in that didn't offer this. The room had styrofoam cups instead of glasses--styrofoam cups? Really? If I had a coffee maker, I'd understand, but what if I want to have some wine? They can't have glasses in the rooms?The lampshades weren't big enough to cover the energy-efficient flourescent light bulbs, so we had glare in our eyes- until we'd turn them off (then it was too dark).There were (I believe) 6 elevators, which sounds like a lot, but really isn't when you're talking about so many rooms. Many days, it was a long wait to get an elevator. The ice machine was broken on our floor (6th), and on the floor above us (7th), it was working on the floor above that though--we took the stairs to get to it. I could understand if I was staying at a low-price chain hotel, but I expected more from a place that bills itself as the &quot;Grand Dame of Madison Ave.&quot;"
78,1961,Aug 18 2009 	Nice hotel nice price	Great value but a little out of the way. Rooms were clean and service was good. Only negative was doorman who tried to stear us to a gypsy cab for his benefit.
79,1961,Aug 17 2009 	Had a good time	The hotel is well keep. The staff was very helpful during the whole stay. Very convenient location near all that we wanted to see. The rooms were clean and had all the essentials. There was taxi service to and form the hotel at a reasonable cost. We had a great stay in New York in part because of this good Hotel.
80,1961,Aug 17 2009 	Great Location for NYC	We stayed here and really enjoyed it.Service was good and location was perfect to get around NYC. Had been to NY a couple of times prior and had stayed at other places in Midtown but would have to rate this one the best from the lot.Our room was on the smaller side but hey in NYC who spends alot of time in their room anyway?? We had friends also staying who had a twin room which was 2 x double beds and their room was very big...all of us in there for some drinks and not crowded! Its worth what you pay for it in comparison to other more expensive hotels in the same area...
81,1961,Aug 16 2009 	AWESOME!	The room was great! Everyone who worked there was so nice. I am totally planning on staying there again the next time I'm in the city.
82,1961,Aug 14 2009 	Great location	Small but cozy room w/king bed. The bed was so comfy to get into after a long day of walking (pillow top bed). The hotel is centrally located. The ice machine didn't work on our floor so we always ended up going to another floor to get ice. AC worked great. We didn't hear any outside noise. Always had plenty of hot water in the morning to take a shower. Concierge was not very friendly or helpful at all. I was very disappointed in that. They seemed very lazy. All in all we were very happy there
83,1961,"Aug 13 2009 	Location good and not expensive so not bad	In my efforts to cut costs for my employer this year, I am staying at less expensive hotels when possible and chose The Roosevelt this week. I was assigned to Room 953. Check in was fast and polite. Long waits for elevator and it seemed a couple were out of service, but nothing out of hand. Room a bit old and tired looking but clean enough and functional. For the location at US$170 per night, I felt it was a bargain and that is my corporate rate. I did not want to eat at the hotel or in my room (was not appealing to do so) and not using room service saved even more money. I used the ethernet connection for internet at US$14.95 per day which is expensive. I never needed or was offered a bellman or doorman but that is fine - location is great. I see it is popular with tourists over business people. I was fine and happy. For a personal trip, I would stay at The Grand Hyatt which i like better but happy to do my part to cut business travel costs when I can and this was just fine for 4 nights of NY business when I am out of the room from 7 am till 9 or 10 pm everyday anyway."
84,1961,"Aug 12 2009 	""Great Location Exceptionally Poor Service""	My reservation was pre-booked by my company, I was scheduled to arrive in the early morning around 6 a.m., after a long red eye flight from San Francisco to JFK. Since I know most hotels will honor an early check-in, I made sure to e-mail their reservations department one week before my arrival to ensure that they would be able to grant an early check-in, I NEVER received a reply. I arrived to the property, tired, and sweaty from the long walk from grand central, and was hoping to checkin so I could freshen up before my seminar at another hotel. The Guest Service Agent was not polite as well, and gave me this weird look implying that it was obviously too early to check-in, I showed her the e-mail that I sent to their reservations department telling them about the early check-in, she said that was nothing she could do, and that I would have to come back later. She redirected me to the bellman, whom was VERY helpful, and showed me where the restroom was so I could change before my seminar. I arrived later in the afternoon, to check back in, my reservation called for &quot;cozy&quot; queen, I didn't think it was going to be SOOO cozy. My room was directly across the elevator, and I could hear every possible noise you wanted. The reservation was so small, that I had to jump into the bath tub, to close the door, if not, I would be in the way. I went down to the front desk, and asked to move to another room, another gentleman, was not helpful, and said that the entire property was sold out, and wouldn't be able to do anything, I asked, if he could just move me to the other end of the hall, and place someone else in my room, they said &quot;no&quot;.Checking out was another experience, as I walked to the elevator, three housekeepers walked by room without acknowledement, or something as simple as a &quot;good morning&quot;Bellstaff was helpful, more helpful than the front desk. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again."
85,1961,"Aug 10 2009 	Tired and Noisy	Read the mixed reviews and chose to be booked in here as it was one the 'approved' list for my firm. What a mistake! The lobby, bars, and food areas are fine. The room, however, was tired, smelled of smoke, old (bathroom patina had that special aged look that only 40 years of use can give) and very noisy. From an aircon unit that sounded like it was about to explode to paper thin walls where I could hear arguments on BOTH sides, not a good stay. No internet connection in my room, and the front desk claimed it was my computers problem. Not true, as I used both a mac and an itouch and could see the errors in the wireless setup.Avoid. The hotel rooms need a major refit.Oh, fitness centre was OKish - small, but seemed quiet."
86,1961,"Aug 9 2009 	don't bother!	UNLESS you get a suite, you'll not have enough room for more than 2 people! The safes didn't work, a bobypin was sticking out of the gross carpet and the room was beyond small! After paying a &quot;small&quot; price to upgrade, we got a 2 bathroom suite that was definately workable! Not luxurious but workable!Talk to the bellman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
87,1961,"Aug 9 2009 	Nice lobby... Good location.. rooms a bit tatty/old	Lovely lobby.. Great location... Looks huge!! Loads of floors- typical hotel from a film sort of thing..The rooms were tidy, clean enough but I had a sense of how many people had slept in this room before me lolI cant complain though- this trip was free.. freeee I say- We won a week to New York- flights included so I cant comment on price....Just don't be fooled into thinking this Hotel is amazing.."
88,1961,"Aug 8 2009 	Nothing Rosy About Roosevelt Hotel	Check-in was at 3 pm and we arrived at 6pm but our room was not ready and was still being cleaned. We were given complimentary drinks at the bar and served great martinis! But our room was not ready until two and a half hours later! The luggage was never delivered to our room and we had to call to follow-up and at 11:30 pm it was finally delivered!! When we asked the porter what happened, he had no idea because he just came on the night shift. The bathroom and bedroom were small and no better than a budget hotel. The bathroom door was warped and did not close, the cold and hot water in the bathtub must have been switched because it did not work properly, the glass shelf on the mirror was broken, and there was mold along the rim of the tub and sink, and the fan was broken. At times the pressure in the toilet was low and did not flush. The only update in the bedroom was the flat screen tv and the energy saving light bulbs. The dresser drawer was broken, the bedside lamp looked like a cigarette had burned through the lamp shade, the air conditioner unit was very loud, the down comforter had no duvet cover, and there was no painting hung as advertised in the website photo but two screws were exposed. There was nothing &quot;luxurious&quot; about this hotel whatsoever and it was very disappointing."
89,1961,Jul 27 2009 	Extremely convenient but very busy	Stayed at hotel with wife and 7 year old daughter while in NYC for 5 days on holiday. Have stayed in many hotels in NYC but this was first time at Roosevelt. Arrived a little early and room with two double beds not ready so they gave us a room with a king bed and free roll out for our daughter. Room was on the small side with a small bathroom. We didn't plan on staying in room much so not so concerned about size of room. yes hotel was extremely busy therefore staff also very busy but we were not there to be appreciated by the staff we stayed for location which was extremely convenient to most major attractions. We got a great rate of $160 a night on expedia so at that rate were happy with hotel. Would not pay full rack rate however. Many cheap breakfast and dinner places with good food very close by. relatively good gym free of charge which had no one else in it when i went. Very happy with stay at discount rate
90,1961,"Jul 24 2009 	Possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in: avoid!	We stayed here on the last night of our honeymoon (which we had spent touring New York State) and I cannot begin to express just how appalling it was.The staff couldn't have been less interested in providing a service: we had pre-booked a suite, and ended up in a small room in which you couldn't even walk round the end of the bed, because the staff at the check in desk were &quot;busy&quot; with a wedding elsewhere. And we only got this room because I made a huge stink - I saw three before finally accepting this one as the best of a bad lot - the first smelled of vomit, the second hadn't been made up, and the third stank of stale cigarettes and fried food.It isn't a cheap hotel - but the rude, arrogant and unpleasant staff got them off to a bad start. The room was horribly tatty, the bathroom was a health hazard and all in all, it was a horrible, disgusting way to leave New York - avoid this like the plague. I am only disappointed I cannot leave negative ratings for this monstrosity."
91,1961,Jul 23 2009	BEAUTIFUL	The building and everything about it was georgous. The rooms has thin walls but it's to be expected in older buildings. The service was fantastic. I would stay there again for sure!
92,1961,"Jul 23 2009 	If you stay you'll inconvenience the staff!!	The location of the hotel is great but the service was so terrible!!! Housekeeping kept taking our towels and not replenishing them. They would only give us some if we tipped! The night auditor serviced us whilst sitting on the floor...sitting on the floor! On departure, 4 porters watched me hail my own cab and lug my bag in it!This property has so much potential but the terrible service makes it really unfair value for money!!"
93,1961,"Jul 23 2009 	Excellent price 	I recommend the Roosevelt for those on a budget that just want a clean basic room and good service. The location is perfect. You are a 2 block wallk to Grand Central. Staying there gives you a real feel of what it is like to live in the heart of the city. We got two rooms for us and our teenagers. They made sure to put our rooms close together. We had a rental car and weren't sure if there would be parking out front, but the bellman was very good at moving the traffic along so guests could park and unload, and then he immediately took our car to the parking garage. That saved a lot of hassle."
94,1961,"Jul 23 2009 	SAD DECLINE OF A GRAND OLD LADY	Having stayed at the Roosevelt with a friend a number of years ago, we had a wonderful experience. It was very reminisce of the 1930's with huge chandeliers and sumptuous seating. The decorations were hung for christmas making the whole atmosphere very festive.It saddens me to read so many negative reviews indicating the sad decline of a once fabulous hotel."
95,1961,"Jul 20 2009 	Great hotel for our first trip to NYC	I took my wife on a surprise trip to NYC for our wedding anniversary and I planned most of the trip online. Without knowing NYC, it made it a challenge to find the &quot;right&quot; hotel when swimming through all the online reviews.The location of the Roosevelt Hotel was SO perfect for our trip. We had tickets to see a show at Carnegie Hall and tickets to see a show on Broadway and both were in walking distance. It rained a couple of the nights we were there, so we ended up taking a cab, but during the day we ended up walking past both areas and Times Square without much effort (and we are both *not* walking people :) The hotel is literally across the street from Grand Central station (there's a small door right to enter Grand Central right across from the front door of the hotel). Great food and shops are aplenty within a one block radius of the Roosevelt.Although the room service seemed expensive, there are several outside restaurants in the area that will deliver right to your room.I had a problem with the first room they assigned to us (I'm a large 6'3&quot; and they gave us a queen bed which made my feet hang over the end), but a quick call downstairs and they moved us to a room with a king sized bed with no trouble.The only thing I wish the room had was in room movies which are great for downtime when you're not out and about in the city. There are no pay per view movies or tv based checkout options with this hotel.All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone who is staying in NYC for the first time or anyone who is looking for a good hotel that isn't in the super crowded times square area, but it still close enough to everything you want to see."
96,1961,"Jul 19 2009 	a nice hotel would definitely comeback if the price was right	upon entering the hotel, I felt as though I was being transformed back to the 1930s. Inside it had an elegant if not dated look. After walking up the red carpeted stairs, I fancied myself to be Clark Gable collecting the Oscar. The hotel staff was courteous and businesslike, but not in a customer service friendly way. After exiting the elevator, I took note that the hallway carpeting,though not in poor shape is worn and needs to be replaced. For all I knew, I could have been following in the footsteps(literally) of Jean Harlow. The overall cleanliness of our room was satisfactory. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the bathroom although the room itself was small. No coffee pot or microwave was a negative. Bed was comfortable,although noisy throughout the nights with the garbage trucks picking up and occasional ambulance. Overall no major problems in four nights there,although the heater could have been an issue if we needed it since it didn't respond after hitting the button. Note to management; the baggage area staff appeared disorganized."
97,1961,"Jul 18 2009 	Fabulous - would definitely go back	We stayed here for four nights in March, and loved it! My husband and I stayed in one room, and two friends stayed in another room. Their room (with two double beds) was much bigger than ours, but in general the rooms were clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. We got a great rate, around $140 a night plus tax, which I thought was fantastic considering the location (45th St!!) and the quality of the hotel. I've paid much more for much rattier hotels in NYC!The location just can't be beat, we'd definitely stay there again. Yes, we saw the odd room service tray in a hall way for hours on end - and the service wasn't amazing, but it's what you'd expect for a really busy hotel in New York. It was very efficient - no one would exactly go the extra mile to help you, but it didn't bother us. It certainly didn't effect out trip - after all, we were in NEW YORK CITY!! We spent more time out and about than in the room.I wouldn't go there expecting it to be 5 star glamour and brand new all the way - but if you want comfort, style and location, The Roosevelt rocks. If you can get a good rate, I'd definitely recommend it."
98,1961,Jul 17 2009 	Very Good Hotel	I recomend this hotel Excelent location and hotel service.
99,1961,"Jul 16 2009 	Bad hotel small rooms and bad service	I was 5 nights there. Paying a Superior room, with two beds, they give us one that are small. Some of the days we don't have towels in room and was necessary call front desk some times. At the end, we have a problem with the key and we need call security to go inside the room. In any aspects, is a 2 star hotel or less.Octavio, Barcelona (Spain)"
100,1961,"Jul 14 2009 	decent hotel	my wife and i and a teen stayed there for a weekend. like all the reviews before , we were blown away by the lobby area. it was very grand. the front desk was helpful even though we got there very late and we thought our reservation might not be honored (bus problems). they gave us 2 double beds. the room was aged but comfortable. the bed was very comfy . it had a good shower head ( no low flow). it had a desk and a flat screen tv but no HD. theres a charge for wi-fi. we wanted to use wi-fi but couldnt get a connection. the toilet did overflow at 6 am but a call to the front desk put that problem away quickly. the location is only about 4 blocks from Times Square and about 3 blks from Grand Central and the subway. we rode the subway and it wasnt bad. the hotel did have a restaurant and bar but we didnt use them. when we went out for breakfast on sunday, we found that a street fair was being set up on Madison right next to the hotel. so we decided to hang there for a while. i think it was about 12-15 blocks long. they said they would hold our luggage after checkout for as long as we wanted. i thought that was very cool. we got a good rate from hotwire so we think it was worth it. we would go there again."
101,1961,"Jul 14 2009 	Location Location Location	Hotel was reccomended to us by a friend. I had read all the reviews and was a bit alarmed by some of them, decided to bite the bullet and see for myself.the hotel was fantastic, location was great, staff were very helpful (had read that all the staff were interested in was looking for tips, I thought they were fine besides this is new york everybody is lookng for tips)lobby is very impresive as is the roof top bar (if not a little expensive)great athmosphere in the lobby.the hotel is 90 years old and the corridors are very dated but it is very clean and has great character. the beds are huge and very comfortable (we did upgrade to a king) room was small but i am let to belive all new york rooms are on the small side.5 - 10 min walk to time square/broadway.hotel expensive for food, have breakfast in the cool deli accross the street (turn left outside 45th street exit and crross the road)"

Times Square is Disneyland, I feel safer on the subway in NYC than I do in my own kitchen, 3 cops on every corner, big brother is everywhere....is that a good thing????"
103,1961,"Jul 10 2009 	never again	We stayed here for 5 nights in total... (1 night then we checked out to go and do a two night side trip to Niagra Falls, and then back for a further 4 nights)While we were waiting for our room to be ready (we arrived at 4 pm and had to wait for 2 hours!!) I made initial enquiries about having some of our bags stored whilst we went on our 2 night trip to Niagra Falls. I was told the storage rate was $8 per bag per day which i thought was overpriced.. i didn't say anything at the time other than i would discuss it with my husband.. when we were finally checked into our room we got sorted out with repacking what bags we wanted to take with us and which ones we wanted to have stored.. mu husband took down the 3 bags that we wanted stored and he came back saying that he had paid for them in advance $2 per bag per day.. i looked at the receipt and it had noted everything was paid..when we went downstairs i spoke to the guy who i had initially spoke to about the storage charges and he again told me that it was $8 per bag per day... i asked him about the discrepancy in the prices given what my husband had just paid with one of his collegues and he stated that &quot;if i wanted HIM to store my bags that was the price.... what his collegue charged was his business&quot; I was gobsmacked at his attitude but really with one or two exceptions... that &quot;money grabbing&quot; attitude prevailed through the staff... asking for tips ALL the time... one american that we were talking to in the lobby whilst we were waiting for our room to b e ready was telling us it cost him $20 to get his luggage from the cab to the room... and that didn't include any portion of the cab fare or tip...Australian aren't accustomed to tipping but we do it when we are in a country where that custom dictates it... when in Rome and all that... but its really bad when the porters are telling you how much they want you to tip them...About the security.....There was no safe in our room... so i put some valuables in an envelope ( I carry a supply of new ones for exactly this purpose, not every hotel room has a safe ).. i had written an inventory of all the items on a piece of paper, signed it and placed it in the envelope and sealed it... took it down to the front desk and asked them to place it in the safe because there was no safe in the room.. which they did... when i went and collected the package the night before we checked out it had been opened... nothing was missing.. but i wonder if that is because they could see by the list that was there that i would know if there was anything missing... No need whatsoever for them to open guests items given to them for safe keepingabout the cleanliness... it doesn't say alot about the cleanliness of a hotel when you see used room service trays sitting in hallways for 3 days without being removed... the only difference is that they start to smell!Now.... the good.... hmmmmmm location is pretty good... the lobby looks nice... but again this is spoilt by the service... there is a fabulous coffee shop/salad bar across the street called Cosi... we had breakfast there each day... great coffee and home made bagels... and wonderful salds which we sometimes had if we were near by at lunch time... plus they have free wifi if you have your computer with youNYC is expensive.... but its such a fabulous place to visit.... dont have your vist marred by staying here.... there are lots of better places to stay that are far more reasonably priced... and with more benefits..."
104,1961,"Jul 10 2009 	Nice hotel in great location	First thing first about this hotel. The checkin is and always is, HORRIBLE! We have had three stays here and not once have we got into a room early, that we asked for weeks in advance and which they said they would try to accomodate. But it never happened. We also had to wait twice past the check in time to get our room. Once we were even traveling with another couple, they had got a smaller room and talked to the desk person in front of us and got upgraded to a bigger room like we had orginally booked. Then I step up to the counter, right behind my friends, and they tell us that they have NO rooms ready right now. About 45 minutes later we got a room. This is pathetic!!! Checkin is at 3:00 here and once we did not get in till 4:30. There is also an older gray haired lady with glasses and an accent that works the counter. She has been there everytime we have visited. STAY AWAY from her. She is undoubtly the rudest person that hates her job I have ever come in contact with.Now to the good stuff. The hotel is nice and appears to be somewhat well kept to NY standards. It is very convenient to Grand Central and not a bad walk to Times Square or Rockefeller Center. There is also a nice store to get breakfast, snacks or even a quick meal diaganolly to the left out the main door (45st). Most shopping up and down Madison and other locations are close by too.The rooms are about average size for NY but the bathrooms are tiny and have no storage or shelving to place things. So therefore make sure the toilet lid is down anytime you are in the bathroom and it is not being used or be prepared to just right off personal items! Also the first time we stayed here the room was a bit noisey but the last few times we did not seem to hear as many sirens, horns or vehicle traffic. Everytime we have upgraded to the larger rooms but everytime them seemed to be getting smaller. Some upgrade rooms are obviously larger than others. No use to complain though.There is also a nice bar in the lobby with helpful bartenders and supposedly a roof top bar in the summer months but we never made it up to it. We stopped and looked at the fitness center but we never used it though. It appeared to be set up mostly with treadmills and cardio equipment and somewhat small.Overall we will use this hotel again and I would recommend it to others, minus the obviously angry checkin staff. Remember, angry gray haired glasses lady with an accent = bad check in experience!"
105,1961,"Jul 9 2009 	Elegant 	The Hotel in general was very clean, elegant and the atmosphere was inviting. The receptionists, concierge, and staff were friendly. The location was spot on, very close to shopping, a walking distance to Times Square, Broadway Theatres, subway, etc. My only disappointment was that the housekeeping staff were loud in the morning (no consideration for visitors who are trying to relax and sleep in late). There was no microwave, not even a coffeemaker in our room, which is a standard in most hotels I've been into."
106,1961,"Jul 7 2009 	Great Location but dated rooms	Generally speaking if you get a GREAT rate go ahead and book. On the positive side Great Location; grand old fashion lobby; rooms are clean and roomy for NY standard. On the negative side cold service; rooms are outdated, not much amenities in room (plastic cups, only shampoo no conditioner or shower gel)"
107,1961,"Jul 6 2009 	Great Location Good Value	Stayed at the Roosevelt for a weekend getaway to New York. We reaped the benefits of the Travelzoo discount, paying $175/night (including all taxes which in NYC are extraordinarily high). Unlike some reviewers on here, I noticed no distinction in treatment by having booked online through a discount outlet.We got to the hotel at about noon and our rooms were not yet ready, but there is no problem checking bags with the bellhop. We did the same on our departure, as our bus back to the DC Area did not leave until 5pm and checkout was much before that.Rooms are fairly small. What do you expect? It's New York. We had a mid-sized room which was appointed with a king bed, a small sitting area with chair and reading table, a desk, a TV with cable, and private bath. We were on the 16th floor, which meant that we were far enough above the street to not hear too much street noise. Still, earplugs were good to have. No noise from adjoining rooms or the hallway. Beautiful lobby areas but very, very, very expensive lobby bar. A large Starbucks drip coffee was $3.75 in the morning. Considering you can't walk two blocks in NYC without tripping over three Starbucks, take the walk. We visited mad46, the rooftop bar, which tries very hard to be a hipster joint. We enjoyed a $15 mojito which, while good, was not anywhere near the $15 value.The best thing about the Roosevelt is its location. 2 blocks to Grand Central Terminal which connects you to the Lexington Avenue subway lines. About 3-4 blocks to Times Square, where you can pick up any subway line you want. One block off Fifth Avenue for the shoppers in the family. Aside from taking the train to Brooklyn, to the Upper East Side, and the Lower East Side to meet friends, we were able to walk everywhere in midtown. So all told - a great value in a great location, especially if you can get an Internet discount.The only drawbacks - very long checkin lines with not enough help, and the elevators could be a huge problem if you were on a lower floor. As I said, we stayed on 16, so we had no problem getting on an elevator. But they'd stop 3 or 4 times on the way to the lobby and by the 10th floor, the elevator was often totally full.Travel tip - walk the 10 blocks to Ess-a Bagel at 53rd and 3rd for breakfast one morning. You'll be glad you did."
108,1961,Jul 5 2009 	Fabulous hotel in a fabulous location	I stayed at the Roosevelt with my boyfriend for 5 nights and had a fantastic stay. I had been worried by some of the negative reviews I had seen on TripAdvisor but couldn't find anything wrong with the hotel myself. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable - the bed was really comfortable. The lobby was gorgeous and the Mad46 bar was lovely. The hotel was in a perfect location for most big New York sights. I booked the hotel though Expedia and got a really good deal on a King Size bedroom. I come to New York every year and I will definitely be returning to this hotel.
109,1961,"Jul 4 2009 	Outdated. Not so clean. Rude 	First let me begin by stating I've been traveling to NYC for business and pleasure for many years. Yes, hotel has good location, but again you are in NYC. The lobby looks grand as their web site presents, and was at one time I'm sure the sparkle and gem that it should be. This hotel is very run down, outdated, and just does not live up to the web site photos. The rooms were VERY dirty. Hair in the bathroom, tub, toilet and on the bedding sheets along w/stains. From the moment of check-in till check out I found the staff to be nothing but unhospitable. I'm not sure why you choose to work in the hospitality industry if you do not enjoy working with the public or visitors/guests?I think you can do A LOT better in NYC in the same price range and three star class that this hotel claims."
110,1961,"Jul 3 2009 	Old Outdated Fancy Lobby Room not worth that amount of money	We stayed in SOHO for 2 nights earlier and paid half the price at the Hampton Inn. They had free breakfast, free wifi, and room that was twice as clean and twice the size of the Roosevelt. The room has an old rusty air con, dirty walls, broken shower. room 1581."
111,1961,"Jun 29 2009 	Comfortable	Really enjoyed our stay. The beds are very comfortable, great location, helpful staff. The pipes from neighboring rooms were a little noisy at night, but it wasn't that bad."
112,1961,"Jun 28 2009 	Needs Updating	The Reception was about the best place, helpful staff and quite grand. My Room was a reasonable size but dated, the bathroom needs totally renovating. The restaurant was closed in the evening and the room service is very expensive, I was on business so not paying myself but if I was then would have felt ripped off. This hotel is not cheap so go somewhere else for the money. Also, no cable/pay TV or wi fi when I stayed but this was temporary."
113,1961,"Jun 28 2009 	Very lovely hotel friendly staff!	It was within perfect walking distance to everything, which was so nice! When we checked in our room was upgraded to a larger one with two king sized beds (originally had a cozy queen which i was going to be sharing with my BFF) but we weren't sure why. The room was so nice, the beds amazing. It was narrow like you'd expect a hotel in NY to be but wasn't small. After a night on the town we got back to the hotel and wanted to try to seasonal rooftop bar that our room book said would be open late, but it was closed. So we headed to the regular bar. Our bartender was super amazing, making us drinks to try on the house. He was so friendly :) The next morning our bus didn't leave till later in the day and we didn't want to lug our bags around so the woman at the desk extented our check out till 1 for no charge. The doormen are also awesome, very informative and helpful, helped us to decide if we had enough time to walk to make our dinner reservations on time or if he should get a cab."
114,1961,"Jun 25 2009 	Super location	Staff was friendly and very helpful. The location was excellent as it was a short walk to Grand Central Station. The lobby is beautiful, the room was very comfortable, but the bathroom was pretty small. The only complaint would be an odor on all the floors when you step out of the elevator but the room was perfect, no odor. I will definitely stay there again!!"
115,1961,"Jun 24 2009 	Not sure why its rated as high as it is!	I chose this hotel based on combination of price and trip advisor rating. Best thing about it was location, 2nd best was the shower (good water pressure and hot). Room was very tired with peeling wall paper and dirty net curtains. Beds were comfy though. Bathroom was Ok but had damaged mirror and cracked basin. I have stayed in better places in New York for the same price. All a bit faded with European styling that needs updating."
116,1961,"Jun 24 2009 	Great Location dated hotel!	We stayed here for the first three nights of our honeymoon. The Roosevelt was easy to find and looked extremely grand as we entered the hotel. We were carrying a lot of luggage which we had to carry up the flight of steps that face you as you walk in to the foyer. This did prove to be a challenge and although there were plenty of staff around were offered no assistance. Having been to NY a few times before I knew not to expect the largest of rooms and was pleasantly surprised at the size of what we got but this hotel is desperate for some TLC. The corridors and lifts needed refurbishment, the rooms were clean but dated. The corridors were strewn with room service items that had been discarded outside by the occupants, this included several broken wine glasses, not the safest thing to have lying around we felt!! You could tell that the Roosevelt used to be a fabulous hotel but having not been modernised for a few decades it has lost its lustre. I would recommend this hotel as a cheap stay in a good location but dont expect anything as glossy as the website suggests!"
117,1961,"Jun 22 2009 	Not as great as it looks and it doesn't look that great	The Good:- Location: Five blocks to TS area, subway, etc.- Service: Above average considering pairs.- Food: Not that innovative cookery, however at expected levels for NYC.The Bads:- Price v/s value, even considering that you won't get anything cheap in NYC.- Size: Hotel has MANY rooms in nearly 15 floors, that seem a little too big to handle for the personnel. You will see dishes and tables more than often in the corridors for more time than usual.- Old: Air conditioner noisy, poor bathroom infrastructure."
118,1961,"Jun 18 2009 	Loved NYC but Will not be returning to the Roosevelt	We stayed at the Roosevelt in May 2009 for three nights. It was my first visit to NYC and although I loved NYC I would not stay at the Roosevelt Hotel. When upon arriving the hotel is impressive due to the decor and grandeur of the lobby, but that's where it ends. We purchased our accommodations online as they were offering rooms at half price - so 150.00 a night, so it was worth it for that but would definitely not pay 300.00 a night to stay there. Ok the pros are it is in a fantastic location, walking distance to Times Square, Central Park. one block away from Central Station, Good Bed and New TV Monitor. The cons: The hallways and rooms look outdated and used, would need a plaster and paint job. The rooms are very small, best suited to wash up and sleep - not to stay in for long periods, use the lobby - more pleasant!!! They do not provide a coffee machine, so if you are like me and look forward to that first sip of coffee in the morning - you'll have to wait 'till you get outside. All the hotel services cost - YOU PAY for EVERYTHING and in my opinion are too expensive. For example, 1) they provide Starbucks Coffee in the lobby at double the price that star buck charges, and by the way there is a Star Bucks coffee shop one block away, 2) They provide wireless internet at 17.00 a day - most places provide this free of charge 3) Be ready to tip always for services you may not want, when we arrived a Hotel Staff grabbed our suitcases and delivered them to our room without asking - so of course we had to tip.Here are some tips that may save you some money, whereas going through the hotel may cost you more. In Central Station, there is a booth with several free guides on restaurant prices and locations, attractions etc. I suggest to check this out, you can then pick restaurants within your price range and there are several good ones to choose from. The Subway is a practical and cheap way to get around. We were quite impressed with it's efficiency and cleanliness. The hotel will try to sell you the idea of taking a cab to the airport. We took a shuttle service for half the cost, and with 24 hour reservations, they will drive you to the Hotel and pick you up from this location - http://www.nyairportservice.com/page.php?id=31.It's worth staying here if you have a very good deal, will be out most of the time visiting the City and do not need Hotel Services - Oh bring your own coffee pot. :)"
119,1961,"Jun 16 2009 	Elegant hotel excellent location superb staff smaller rooms	I have stayed at the Roosevelt probably 10-15 times over the last 4 years as a frequent business traveler to New York and it remains my first choice. I find the lobby to be quiet and inviting. It was built in a golden age of american architecture, and I enjoy the class and elegance the hotel lobby displays.Upon check in , there are always plenty of people to check you in our out no matter the time of day. Once you have your key there are about 5 elevators that unfortunately can be quite slow as they have many floors to cover and they operate a bit slowly. Once you arrive to your room you may find it to be a bit small for your tastes, but this is typical for NYC. The bed is elegant and quite comfortable, even if you end up in one of their smaller &quot;cozy&quot; rooms where the bed takes up most of the room! The bathrooms are always clean with ample supplies. I suppose the only criticism is that the carpeting and decor is a bit outdated and dull. I was upgraded to a suite once which was really nothing more than a regular room, with an additional smaller room that had an ugly green carpet and a gross looking couch in it. Nonetheless, its quiet and comfortable. I have not eaten in the restaurant so I can't comment on that, but I've spent plenty of time having a night cap or an after work drink at the hotel bar. It's quiet and classy, with attentive bartenders. There's also small tables if you prefer to be alone. Excellent assortment of fine liquors (i'm a scotch guy), or just a beer. It's a little pricey to be honest, but the ambience is inviting. It's not rowdy or even noisy even when it's crowded. I've gotten room service many times and the food has always been delicious and on time. Try the Salmon with a half bottle of white wine. The best feature as a business traveler is that they have a car service available almost any time to take you right to LaGuardia or JFK. This beats finding a taxi hands down. I believe its $40 (not including gratuity), which really isnt' that much more than a taxi would cost. I take the shuttles out of LaGuardia and I know if I'm staying at the Roosevelt I can check my bags with the bell desk, go to my meetings during the day, and get right in a town car to the airport quickly. If you want to save a buck, see if anyone else waiting in line wants to split it with you. I've done that a few times and had some good conversations with folks from all sorts of industries and locales on the way. The Roosevelt isn't cheap, but it's not outrageous either. It's in a prime location where you will get every penny you pay for. It's worth it. SIgn up for their email specials and you won't be dissapointed. They had an excellent winter rate last winter that I even came down and stayed over a weekend for pleasure."
120,1961,"Jun 12 2009 	Nice stay at The Roosevelt	We stayed at The Roosevelt for three days and the visit was pleasant. We were in New York for business and the hotel was ideal for us. The hotel is located near a lot of what New York has to offer. The rooms are typically small for New York hotels. We arrived early at 9 am and while check was at least six hours away we advised to try back after noon as the room maybe ready.The service was par with the cost of the hotel and everyone we dealt with was friendly and helpful.The costs were a bit extreme, but this is New York and if you don't mind walking out the front door and down a block you can find reasonably priced &quot;New York&quot; meals and drinks.Overall a good visit and we will return."
121,1961,Jun 12 2009 	Pleasant NYC Stay	The Roosevelt is very nice overrall. I enjoyed the old school New York City feel - although very modern. The rooms were clean and in good shape for an old hotel. The bed was the best part. Very comfortable. The room had a nice flat panel TV - but no high definition - so the quality of watching any television is low. There is no free Internet. The hotel is a quick walking distance from Times Square - and there are plenty of places to eat and drink right around the hotel. I was attending a conference within the hotel - and the conference setup and food served was very good. Again though - no free Internet - which is tough when attending a conference and having no quick Internet access. I enjoyed my stay and would come back.
122,1961,"Jun 10 2009 	Good Location	Within 10min walking distance from Times Square / Broadway and most other attractions.Lovely hotel, but very expensive bar! Our room was small but ideal for a short break."
123,1961,"Jun 7 2009 	Pleasantly surprised	My daughter and I stayed at the Roosevelt for 3 days and 2 nights. I was a bit wary after reading some of the Tripadvisor reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. The location is superb, the lobby is as grand as advertised, and while our guest rooms was as many have noted, not large, it was clean, quiet and comfortable. The beds were indeed very comfy as others have commented. The bathroom was also small, but the shower had plenty of pressure and consistent water temp, and the towels were thick and soft. What more do you want from a hotel bathroom!The front desk gave us an umbrella which came in handy during the rains. Just remember to return it or else they will charge you $ 25. Oh and don't forget since this is New York after all, there will another ~ $ 30 for various occupancy taxes, Jacob Javits tax, etc. The high speed internet didn't work at first but someone from IT was up in a jif and got it going quickly.The guys out front seem to do a good job hailing taxis, both the yellow licensed cabs and the &quot;unofficial&quot; dark black unmarked limos. Our only gripe -- the elevators, praised by other reviewers, were always slow and almost always overcrowded. On the morning of our checkout, we were in a hurry and finally gave up and lugged our luggage down 4 flights of interior stairways down to the shop level and then up again a flight to the lobby!"
124,1961,"Jun 5 2009 	Good hotel if the price is right	At US$134 per night plus taxes, the hotel was great value, but I think this is more due to the economic downturn than anything else. Location was good, but don't be fooled - Grand Central is still a couple of blocks walks (plus negotiating through the tunnels) and Times Square is several blocks away. Not impossible distances, but be prepared for a lot of walking.Hotel was good generally, but in our case, the walls were thin (this is such a hit and miss thing with hotels). We could hear people talking in the next rooms. We also had a very bad first night with young drunken fools running and shouting along the hall in the early hours (perhaps the down side of heavily reduced hotel rates ?).As a rule, these older hotels are not well insulated. Noise from roadworks were quite audible. If we stayed there again, we would insist on a quieter room wherever that would be (if one does exist)."
125,1961,"Jun 4 2009 	Great place really good for the money paid	The location is perfect. Really close to Grand central terminal and in the middle of Midtown. Just for that reason I would go back forever.The most of the people was really helpful and kind.The room was big enough for three people, and the bed was so comfortable that I just lie down and got asleep. The pillows were PERFECT.But there are two things that I loved the most: 1.- So many elevators!!! Almost nothing of waiting time. And in a city like NYC,where the time is money, UFFF that is so valuable!2.- The room was made really early. We went out early in the morning and we returned before noon and it was made up. Wonderful!And we got our room at a very good price: 3 people for 163 USD per night. A bargain!"
126,1961,"Jun 4 2009 	Location location location	We just returned from a very pleasant stay at The Roosevelt, a grand dame of NY hotels.The location is perfect. Madison and 45th. Ten minute walk to Rockefeller Center. Twenty minutes to Central Park. One block from Grand Central Station. A couple of blocks from American Girl.Front desk staff were friendly and accomodating. Inititially there wasn't a room ready for us at Noon, when we arrived. However, the clerk double-checked again after processing our reservation and a room had come available. Great service.Concierge, doormen and bellhops all very friendly.Rooms are very small but comfortable and clean. Ladies, if you like to spread your toiletries and make-up out on a counter in the bathroom you will be disappointed. No counter space. But in the scheme of things a minor, minor thing.Nice thick walls. Very quiet hotel. Barely heard any noise from neighbors or elevator traffic.I have stayed in very expensive NY hotels too and frankly for the price I paid at The Roosevelt the others are a complete rip off (my price was $139 a night before tax and fees). Plus, at a couple of these expensive hotels I have waited 5 minutes for an elevator. The Roosevelt has a bank of 6 elevators and we never had to wait.We got offered the &quot;hotel car&quot; too by the doorman on our way back to the airport. I took him up on it even tho I knew it was an unlicensed taxi cab and not a &quot;hotel car&quot;. I was traveling in rush hour and I liked the flat rate. Just know what the deal is and you're OK, right?"
127,1961,"Jun 3 2009 	Great location nice rooms but staff at front desk rude.	For NYC we got a special on $150 a night at the Roosevelt which is a historical hotel landmark. In NYC it is difficult to get rooms anywhere for this price and for them to be nice. The location is midtown and close to the empire state building, grand central station, 5th Avenue. The rooms were nice but small (typical NYC). The only complaint was the unfriendly staff at the front desk. They were rude and kind of argued with me when the internet was not working...making it seem like I didnt know what I was doing. They finally credited me back after there was a problem with the internet in a majority of the hotel. The doormen and concierge were great."
128,1961,"Jun 1 2009 	Amazing deal in NYC! Walk back into the days of TITANIC!	I found that if you find a cheaper rate anywhere on the internet this hotel will match it and give you another 10% off the room per night. The hotel is very elegant and classical inside. The rooms are a little small but the overall room is very nice and more importantly th bed is very comfortable.Not too hard. The hotel had alot of history and fun to read about. Ive stayed in some of the most expensive hotels in the city but for the price and location I cant complain! I found some people were paying 399.00 a night for the samew room we where paying 164.00. I am returning next week and paying 145.00 a night for 5 nights! You may not always be able to get this good a deal but I promise if you surf the internet enough for the best price you will come out ahead compared to what other hotels are charging and not half as nice. I have only one complaint about the hotel.Service. We had to wait in a line for check in but this was a problem each day we walked by at 3pm.I suggest showing up a little later for check in if you can. And when our cab pulled up the bellman didnt offer to help with our bags. I was glad we didnt have too much. It saved us the tip. If you want to spend over 500.00 a night in the city the best place for me is The NY Palace! Hands down. But if you want a nice place but not the price tag then I strongly urge you to try The Roosevelt. The location is close to everything and beautifully decorated. I felt like i had walked back in time. Ive stayed at THE PALACE many times and love it but its just got too expensive in our economic crunch right now.I am happy to return to The Roosevelt again and again as long as I can keep the rate where it is. Im not too concerned with service when i have my husband with me to carry the bags,LOL! Im sure I will be able to get a bellman when I return alone next week."
129,1961,"May 29 2009 	Awesome mid-town location.	After reading some of the other reviews - you may be having doubts about the Roosevelt. Don't believe the hype - The Roosevelt is a sure bet for an extended stay in NYC.We stayed for 5 days and throughly enjoyed every moment. The hotel is in the BEST location !! Walking distance to the highlights of NYC. Fifth Av - one block, Grand Central - one block, Chysler building - one block, Times square - two blocks, ESB - a few blocks, etc etc etc !!! It is one of the greatest feelings to walk out the front door of your hotel and be right in the middle of the action. While you are in NYC you don't want to waste time travelling.The rooms are cosy (re - small) but very adequate - let's face facts - who goes to NYC to spend time in their hotel room ? Great TV and a clean functional shower. All you need.Remember - this is New York - space is at a premium.The hotel bar is very plush and a great place to have a drink before heading out on the town. The hotel is quite large so is normally busy at most times but the staff are helpful and professional. There are about 6 elevators so getting in and out usually takes minimal time.All in all a great choice for a stay NYC !"
130,1961,"May 28 2009	Bad experience... that's all!	The service is completly horrible! I was surprise how they just don't care about there guests with all the competiton arround New York City... The valet survice: don't use it, they've damaged my care and one other car in the same day! It just doesn't worth paying to stay at the Roosvelt .... R.B"
131,1961,"May 28 2009 	Rooms need updating	We just got back from three days at the Roosevelt. The hotel lobby is very impressive. The front desk workers were rude. Not very helpful. I Felt we were treated poorly once they knew we booked through expedia. There were 6 elevators...but only one at a time seemed to be working. We were on the 7th floor. Elevators had at least 10 people in them every time we used them. And you could tell by the moans from the people already in the elevator, that it was stopping at every floor. And continued throughout our trip to the lobby. The rooms are small, but nothing out of the ordinary for NYC. The bathrooms were dirty. Mold on the shower tiles and ceiling. No vent for steam. Grout peeling throughout the bathroom tiles. There was no place to put anything in the bathroom. The sink was just a pedistal. Small glass shelve above the toilet that held tissues and soap. We ended up moving those out of the room to gain a little space. The beds were very comfortable and the floor we were on was quiet. Location was good and very close to grand central for subway access. Stayed there only because the deal through expedia couldn't be beat. Would not stay again."
132,1961,"May 28 2009	No Noise but Bed Bugs Bite	Went to the Roosevelt Hotel in NY which was pretty much a nightmare from the moment we got there. We arrived around noon and were told to pre book into our room. Waited in a long line at the front desk... gave ID and a credit card, we were told to check our luggage and wait in another line and come back at 3:00 p.m. We got to the hotel at 4:00 and had to stand in line again to get the room key, where I had to show my ID again... I asked the front desk why I had to bother to pre book earlier when I still had to stand in line 4 hours later and do go through the same process .... She said &quot;Well, I guess from the guests point of view its not convenient&quot;. I replied what other point of view is there? Well that little comment got me a room right outside of the elevators with the ding! ding! bell going off every 5 minutes and trying to sleep with everyone talking in the hallway was horrible. OH yes! walking the street of NY I just wanted to soak my feet. Well, didn't have a bath tub in the bathroom just one huge shower with only a curtain separating it from the toilet. So called down to ask for a different room due to the noise and my feet wanting to be pampered. Was then told that I did not request a bath tub when I booked! I said I have never in my life booked a room and had to request a bath tub. Made me feel like I was stupid and should have read the fine print before I booked. So I proceeded to tell them about the noise and the Manager who was rather rude said I would have to call back later to see if I could get another room. I asked if I just go right up to the counter or will someone bring me new keys? OH NO I had to go back down and wait in line again. Now it is 8:00 p.m. got a new room with no noise but it came with bed bugs. We were bitten all over and I am still scratching one week later. Would never stay at that hotel again if you gave me a room with a view and breakfast in bed free for a week.I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. Would like to add that I am a frequent traveler to NY and have stayed at many other hotels in midtown with no issues."
133,1961,"May 26 2009 	Nice hotel nice location nice price.	I booked this hotel through a deal on Travelzoo and was fortunate to score a price of $159 per night for a double room. The usual price is around 199 per night according to the website. It is located 2 blocks (short blocks) from Grand Central Terminal, which is a great access point to transportation anywhere else you might want to go in Manhattan. It is three blocks (long blocks) to Times Square. It is also within walking distance to Rockefeller Center. The location is very nice and ideal for the NYC tourist.The hotel is known for it's elegant, splendid, old New York-style lobby. It really does feel like you are stepping back into the roaring 1920s. There is a nice bar to the side that is nice to sit back in, have a cocktail and people watch. The gift shop was very small, but contained an adequate supply of needed items, toiletries, drinks, etc. Check in was very quick at the time I checked in, around 7pm. The room was also nicely decorated, very clean, but maybe a tad dated (after all, the hotel is 80+ years old). For NYC, it was a very nice size. I've stayed in double rooms in NYC that were half this size. The bed was quite comfortable, although the pillows were very flat, feather I believe. It had a nice flat screen TV with a lot of channels to surf at night. The bathroom was also nice and adequate. It was definitely clean, but nothing really special. The room did not have a coffee maker, which I believe in these days is a bare necessity for a hotel room, especially one of this caliber. They do offer Starbucks coffee downstairs at the bar in the mornings with snacks for purchase, but who wants to have to get dressed to go get early morning coffee?The hotel has a new rooftop bar called mad46 (after Madison Avenue and 46th Street) which I heard is very, very nice, but was unfortunately closed the night I wanted to go, which was my last night in town.Overall, I definitely enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation."
134,1961,"May 26 2009 	Location location location	Stayed at The Roosevelt for 3 nights during my first trip to New York City. Had some reservations about staying there because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. I was not disappointed or surprised. The location of The Roosevelt is awesome, but the rooms are old and tired. Some reviewers indicated it was dirty. I think it was as clean as an old room can be. Our room was inexpensive compared to other NYC hotels - 1/3 to 1/2 the price of other hotels. I can overlook the tired, old and small room because of the affordable price and great location. It is not a resort top service hotel, but I did not go to NYC to stay in my hotel room. We only stayed in the room to sleep and the bed sheets were clean. The front desk ladies were a little sharp, but we attributed it to the New York attitude. Besides, how much interaction do you really have with the front desk?"
135,1961,"May 23 2009 	nice stay but rude staff	I had a reservation for a non smoking room and got a smoking room, when I complained about I was told that there were not anon smoking room available and I would have to wait until the next day. I had a child with me and for me that was unaccetable."
136,1961,"May 22 2009 	Great location rooms and bathrooms need to be refurbished.	This old hotel has a prime location and impressive lobby, however my room and bathroom were in desperate need of updating."
137,1961,"May 22 2009 	Hotel in need of Renovations	I booked two nights from 5/9 to 5/11/09 at The Roosevelt for me, my cousin &amp; daughter. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the unpleasant odor of cigaratte smoke (which was present everytime we entered and exited the hotel). Thankfully, the curbside bell hops were pleasant to deal with and so were the registration staff. The lobby is well furnished and the decor is very ornate but a bit too dark. We had drinks at the bar and the staff there was very entertaining. However, as we made our way up to the 7th floor, we noticed the hallways were very dated and old looking. Unfortunately, the same dated and well worn decor was inside our large two bed suite. All the furniture and linens should have been donated to the goodwill and replaced with a higher end product to better represent this old and established hotel. Thankfully, we had two large windows in the room and also one in the large bathroom. But there was a group of protestors across the street screaming about something or another and being in the city the buildings acted like a microphone so we had to keep the windows closed. Regarding the bathroom, the tiles in the shower were worn and the floor drain was broken. Thankfully, I brought my shower shoes!! Overall, everything seemed seedy and unkept. In fact, I refused to sit on any of the fabric chairs because they were dusty and too worn for my taste and comfort. The whole room was a disaster for $189/night which was the deal I found on TravelZoo when I upgraded to their largest 2 bed suite. By the way, don't bother ordering a refrigerator for $25 extra. It's the smallest tiny old frig I ever saw. Also, the hotel is in the midst of changing from cable to satelite or vice versa. As a result, there were barely any channels to see and most of those were fuzzy. The maintenance tech was unable to correct it. Oh yeah, room service is non-existent between noon and 5pm. The staff explained it as a necessary budget cut due to the recession."
138,1961,"May 19 2009 	A Very Tired Hotel	Background: We are British, in our early 60s and retired. We booked this hotel at the recommendation of our travel agent, because it provided one free night in a good location, prior to returning to UK aboard the QM2. We chose to book an additional 3 nights @ 77 pppn room only, enabling us to see something of New York City.Location: Excellently situated in Midtown Manhattan and within 15 minutes walk of Times Square, Empire State Building, Central Park, UN Building, etc. There are lots of restaurants nearby, and its just a block from Grand Central Station. The fixed price Yellow Cab was a good way for two to get in from JFK efficiently and comfortably ($45 + $4.15 QM Tunnel Toll + tip). The hotel is also an easy walk from the stops for the Hop-On  Hop-Off bus tours.Accommodation: The entrance lobby is quite impressive, giving the impression of pre-war grandeur and the reception and hall-porter services were efficient. However, corridors were dingy and our room, apart from the bed and the new flat-screen TV, was in great need of redecoration and refurbishment. The room was a reasonable size and there was a fine king-size bed, although too high for my wifes little legs! There was only one bed-side light. There was no view from our 15th storey window, but there was a lot of traffic noise all night total 18 storeys).There was no kettle or tea/coffee making facilities. However, a coffee-maker was provided foc once we called for one. (Being Brits, we would have preferred a kettle and teapot!) However, we needed to phone for more coffee and milk sachets each day, as they would not provide more than one days supply at a time  just irksome. We certainly did not appreciate all drinking vessels being paper cups  do they not have porcelain and glasswear!? The room safe was broken and unusable.We did not use the restaurant as it was too pricey, compared with the numerous establishments nearby. The bell-boys would give recommendations of where to eat, but they were likely to send you where they would get commission. We actually found that the adverts in the hotels information pack in the room were more reliable.When leaving to go to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal the doorman hailed us a waiting limo, assuring us that this was better than getting a yellow cab or any other option. It was nice to ride in a limo and we avoided the risk of dodgy practice by some cab drivers, but on checking later with other passengers, we found on paying $55 plus tip that we had probably paid nearly double what was necessary. Clearly the doorman had a nice little arrangement operating!Overall, we would not return to the Roosevelt. It does not merit its 4 Star Rating and is overpriced for what it is (even for New York)."
139,1961,May 17 2009	Completely turned off by events and front desk staff at The Roosevelt Hotel	I am currently searching for a NYC hotel to accomodate my out of town wedding guests in early 2010 and came across the Roosevelt Hotel. Contacted the events planner Rose Garafolo - who right from the beginning seemed a bit disorganized and frazzled. After several correspondences via email - i had scheduled an appt with Rose to view a room today. When I went to the front desk - I was informed by Alfredo (an extremely rude employee - who seems to get frustrated very easily when asked a question) that there were no rooms. Instead of trying to ease the situation - Alfredo seemed to perpetuate it - given it was Rose's miscommunication. To make a long story short - I left the hotel feeling disrespected and completely turned off by the way the staff treats their guest and potential clients. after reading other reviews on this site - im not the only one thats had a bad experience at this so called hotel.
140,1961,May 16 2009	Great hotel and location	We were in NYC for the NYU graduation. This was a fantastic place to stay. The location was superb one block from Grand Central so you could easily go wherever you wanted. The area is close to many things yet far enough away from the Times square madness! The staff was friendly and it was just a good experience! The hotel has a rich history and was remodeled in the late 90's
141,1961,"May 13 2009 	Nice hotel great location... shame about the staff.	On our trip covering the USA and Canada, we have stayed at numerous hotels, ranging from very cheap to very pricey. Our daughter found the Roosevelt for us online and they were offering a special deal of 3 nights for the price of 2 and a free continental breakfast each day. We got to the hotel and found it was so very beautiful, but then when we spoke to the staff about the offer my daughter was trying to book for us, they turned very rude. They begrudgingly gave us the 3 nights for 2 and only on the last day did they finally let us have a free breakfast. It was almost as if the staff had to pay for the breakfast out of their own pocket. Our room did not have coffee or tea making facilities and when my husband tried to order a coffee to take to our room he was told it was not possible. The staff seemed to have very little knowledge or just didn't want to be bothered with us. One staff member told us she had no idea where the nearest travel agency was, only for us to then find out there was one on the 19th floor. This was a mission also as none of the staff even seemed to know how to get to the 19th floor. All the people we have met in New York are some of the nicest people we have met in the world, but unfortunately I cannot say the same about the staff at the Roosevelt."
142,1961,"May 13 2009 	An absolute dream I only wish I could do it all again!	My boyfriend booked this hotel on expedia and got a very reasonable price to stay for a week over the New Year 2009. I was unaware that he was planning to propose to me, and he had contacted the hotel in advance. He organised a limosiune to drive us to the hotel, which was magical and when we arrived, the concierge immediately took care of our bags (for a fee of course!). Then, to make things even more flawless, the desk attendant upgraded us free of charge to a superior bedroom, which was beautiful and spacious. The decor in the lobby was stunning, and everything was very grand- christmas tree, chandelier etc... Staff were pleasant, and cleaning staff were wonderfully efficient!). They also recommended that we hire one of their black cabs to return us to the airport, which was more comfortable and efficient than a regular yellow cab, and only cost 10 dollars more! good choice!! There is a wonderful steakhouse called Morton's as your exit the main entrance and turn right and walk straight for a block, we celebrated here and although it was very expensive, I have never tasted food like it!!! The location was fantastically close to everything (just a block away from the diamond district where I chose my engagement ring!), and the bed was perfect after a long day sight seeing. We will definitely return to this hotel!"
143,1961,"May 13 2009 	Here's more detail - give the Roosevelt a try more nice than naughty.	After reading a number of reviews, I stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel, and now I understand some of the remarks. There are some very, very nice things about this hotel - and some not so great - but don't pass this hotel by - it's a good value in an otherwise very expensive area of mid-town.Here is more detail for those first timers that I had wished I knew prior to my stay...Location, location, location as mentioned, near Grand Central at 45th and Madison - nearby is Times Square, and loads of subway choices, restaurants, shopping, and plentiful taxicabs.As everyone says, the lobby is beautiful, and has a nice seating area if you are waiting for friends. It's fun to people watch and see the bustle. There's a bellhop and concierge service. There's a coffee bar (agree with other posts you can do better elsewhere, but in a rush it's OK).As opposed to some comments, my check-in experience was very good, and my person was quite nice. I had booked open choice two or one bed; I was asked if a King bed was acceptable, and I agreed. I think now a room with two beds might get you a slightly larger room, but for 1 person the room I had was fine.There are a number of elevators in the lobby, but it is hard to figure out if they are going down, or up - and the punch buttons are only on either side of the bank with no button in the middle. It was actually funny to watch newbies (like me) first look in the middle for the button, and then search the bank for the buttons on the side. At busy times there was a bit of a wait.The room I received (a king on the 7th floor) was at the end of two very long corridors. My room took some time to find. This is a big place, with odd numbered rooms on one side, even on the other. Note that the room number signs don't tell you this, I had to figure it out after wandering down various hallways.Something about the older style reminded me of the Overlook Hotel from the Shining - but thankfully without the horror. The hallways were clean, sort of like grandma's house with a little old musty smell and flowery carpeting with a few stains here and there. The musty smell turned out later to be mostly from the soap and shampoo products in the rooms - which have a peculiar smell - they say aloe, but the fragrence is a bit more cloying than that to me. You get two small soaps, shampoo, conditioner and lotion in little bottles. The soap is very drying, so bring your own if that bothers you.My room was at the end of the hall, and was small, but very clean. The hallway was clear, except for some trays here and there, and someone had left a broken wine glass on the hallway floor that took a day to have cleaned up. The room appointments included the king bed, LCD TV, chest, desk and chair with internet connection access, separate comfy chair, and bathroom. The bed seemed new, and was very comfortable (firm, yet not too hard.) Soft white linens, generous number of pillows, and a mini-coverlet in gold were on the bed. Some hotel pictures with the designer &quot;R&quot; bed pillows were not to be found in this room, but no big deal.The room was a bit hot, so I turned on the older style floor model combo A/C and heater. It worked fine, but was a little loud. Turns out that was a good thing, as each of the two nights I stayed, there was heavy machinery noise from the outside inclusive of rings and beeps that I could hear even over the A/C from 12 mid to around 2 in the morning. Not the hotel's fault - but if you are a light sleeper, recommend ear plugs. I also agree with other posts that you can hear everything in the hallway, from conversations, baby cries, to door knocks, opening and closings, and slams. Thankfully, not too much could be heard in the room from neighbors in their rooms, mostly noise from hallway and outside. (Note the window could open to the outside, but I did not use it.)My neighbors were either a group of goats, or a bunch of wild guys coming in at all hours. Not my business, other than a couple of them banging on my door at 3 in the morning thinking it was their room. I ignored this, and the guys stumbled into their room (after banging that door), and the episode was over.There's a new flat screen LCD TV in the room with fairly good reception, but the higher number channels were fuzzy, and as mentioned in other reviews not a lot of choice of channels - but who spends that much time in the room, anyway?Surprising to me for an older hotel was that there was enough adequate lighting that all worked, and enough mirrors. The room, while small, had a fairly large closet right near the entranceway, with an iron and ironing board available. The overall feel of the room was like staying in grandma's attic room - old, small, clean, layers of cream colored paint and wallpaper, a bit mismatched, a little musty, but mostly cozy and workable. I know it sounds odd, but that was the feeling.The bathroom was very clean, but a bit uninspired. You could see where new tiles had been put in the shower area, with a bowed out curtain bar (nice touch giving more shoulder room), new shower curtain (nice, but did not match decor), a pedestal sink (pretty, but does not give counter space), commode (right next to ancient radiator so little room. and the commode seat was crooked), and two small glass shelves without too much space. The tub had two enamel gouges that someone attempted to repair with enamel paint. Large mirror, with an ugly industrial light, which made the room seem a bit sad and garishly lit. Not good for makeup application. There was a hair dryer, medium wattage - the dryer had a little night light on it, a nice touch. Plenty of clean white towels - but first night no washcloths. TP is cheap and harsh, so bring your own if you are sensitive to same.No coffee maker. No mini-bar. Ice bucket and glasses; soda machines down the hall with ice available. Surprisingly, no NY magazines, maps or tourist publications in the room, you had to ask at the desk or concierge. Checkout can be via TV/phone, but I went to the desk. No problems with my bill. Note that there are a number of city taxes that apply in addition to your room rate per night (almost +$30.)We had a breakfast in the Roosevelt restaurant (mezzanine level just up from the lobby.) Pretty ambience, nice buffet and menu, but EXPENSIVE. There are nearby cheaper places.My overall experience was that this place had all the necessities and is in an incredibly good location and gives pretty good value. Was it amazing? No. Was it clean and a very good value? Yes. Would I stay again for biz? Yes. Would I go for a blow out no expense spared trip into the city? No."
144,1961,"May 13 2009 	great location good value ? rooms	We stayed in a room for 4 people with our two teenage boys. The room was relatively small with two double beds. The boys didn't like to sleep in a double bed and had every night a fight about sharing space, sheets, comforter etc. The location was great just in the centre of Manhattan. I would recommend it."
145,1961,"May 13 2009 	Nice for the Price	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend getaway. The location of the hotel was great. It was just blocks away from Time Squares, Grand Central Station, and shopping on 5th Ave. The hotel itself for nice. The lobby was beautiful and the staff was very friendly. The room was small, however big enough for just my husband and I. My biggest complaint would be the fact that we were placed in a corner room. Each time someone opened or closed their door we could hear it very loudly. If you stay at this hotel be sure to ask for a room in the hallway. I don't think you hear as much noise in the rooms in the hallway.Overall this is a good hotel. I would recommend it to a friend."
146,1961,"May 8 2009 	Great location elegant and good service	My daughter (10) and I stayed for three days at the end of April, beginning of May. The tone was set when we first walked up to the desk, and as I checked in, a staff member made friendly suggestions for taking pictures. The lobby is really quite grand. Our room was on the 16th floor, not noisy, and a comfortable temperature on arrival. No heat/cooling issues, we actually had ok water pressure, the beds and bedding were quite comfortable. The towels were quite soft and new. There were no unpleasant odors (even the 'closed up' smell you sometimes get).The decor is a bit old fashioned, but I am fine with that. The room could use more outlets, and the bathroom is starting to show wear. The coffee/breakfast service in the lounge is skippable, better food for the money can be found in less than a block in any direction. We booked a superiour room through a deal from Travelzoo. This meant a large flatscreen TV in a normal NYC room with a closet on the 16th floor. I have not seen any other rooms at this hotel to compare it to. There was limited HD channels for some reason, they left a note about it (but this didn't meatter to us really)."
147,1961,Apr 30 2009 	AAA location! (but oldfashioned rooms and unfriendly staff)	The location at Madison and 45th in central midtown Manhattan is nothing but great. The lobby of the hotel also looks nice but the somewhat oldfashioned atmosphere gets even stronger in the rooms... Reception staff is very unfriendly but rates of between 150 and 200 USD for a well sized room in midtown NYC are still very good value for money despite the little criticisms.
148,1961,"Apr 30 2009 	Go for the Location...not the Service...	Like others have mentioned...the hotel is situated about a 2 minute walk away from grand central station so it is a great location for those who want to take the MTA all the time. The hotel itself is very old, and for how old it is...the rooms are actually not too bad. The building itself has been kept quite nice, and overall is quite clean.Room noise is bad, you can always hear people entering and leaving rooms, and street noise is pretty abundant(poor insulation I guess), but that is not a big deal...being inside Manhattan I didn't expect it to be too quiet.But my overall experience in terms of service here was quite horrible. I called ahead of time to confirm my reservation as we will be arriving late that night...everything was supposedly ok. Once we arrived however the story was different. We had 2 rooms, and one of them was supposed to be a double...but nope...it magically turned to a Single King, and apparently there was no other room available anymore. So we accepted that and would try to find another room the next day. My only requests were to be situated on a higher floor and to be away from the elevators (we booked 1 month in advance)...but nope...we got the fourth floor...and one of the rooms was right in front of the elevator.Thats when it all went downhill...our other party split with us, then got stuck in the elevator for 1.5 hours...being stuck in an elevator is acceptable since things do break down once in a while...but for 1.5 hours was pretty ridiculous, and there was very very poor communication from the outside staff letting us know what was going on. Anyways, after this fiasco, we met the only 'nice' person of our hotel stay...the evening manager...he was quite apologetic and overall very professional.Anytime we needed service at the concierge or the front desk, the staff just seemed rude and did not act like we were customers...we stayed a total of 14 days there between our 2 rooms and the only time we felt there was customer service was with the bellhop and the night service manager, everyone else was just rude. We visited the Grill inside the Hotel for breakfast...the staff there were equally unpleasant; Absolutely no service, they would just stand around and talk to each other...when we say thanks, they never would reply with a welcome or any response for that matter...Also the safe's in both rooms were not operational when we initially checked in. The business center charges you around 30cents a minute for internet with a minimum $3 charge, but the computers are so slow, you spend half the time just waiting for things to load.Be it perhaps we are high maintenance, or just demanding too much...but we would definitely not recommend or repeat even though it was a great value, and great location."
149,1961,"Apr 29 2009 	Classic Hotel Great Location	The Roosevelt is defentily in a very good location. Next to Grand Central Station, one block from Rockefeller Plaza, two blocks from Times Square, and about half a mile from the Empire State Building. When you walk into it is is very impressive. Very elegent and classic with big chandelliers, and nice marble floor. There is a bar which is full most of the time and serves food. The rooms are a bit small but thats New York for you. The beds were very comfortable and the shower was pretty good. The staff were friendley and were very helpful. Overal the hotel was very good and I would definitly tay ther again. Also Stage Deli and Lindey's which are restaurants that are legendary were very good and close by."
150,1961,"Apr 29 2009 	One of the best hotels in NY	The service was amazing, the rooms had good veiws over the city, with many lifts in the hotel, it took no time to get up to the rooms. It had a good posh feel, but not too pricey. Although the cost of the meals in hotel are something to look out for.All round though and enjoyable expirence and would definetly go bakc again"
151,1961,"Apr 28 2009 	superb roosevelt	have just returned from staying at the roosevelt. we found the rooms were a really good size, the beds were really comfortable,the hotel is really well situated for walking to loads of the city sights including central park, times sq, statue of liberty and many more, the subway is across the road. would i recommend this hotel. yes in a heart beat. i cant say anything bad about it and we stayed for 5 nights."
152,1961,"Apr 24 2009 	Our stay was great........	I took both of my kids to spend a two nights in NYC and we chose the Roosevelt Hotel for hotel and value. I was a bit concerned after I read some of the reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. The room we had (Room 822) was a great size room. Accomodations were good for the price that we paid. The location can not be beat. I valeted my car which I felt was a bit pricey ($55.00 a night) but I was travelling with two kids so I didn't have much of a choice. The staff was courteous other than one person at the front desk. The bell captain was very helpful. Recommended great restaurant in the city. All in all, I think this hotel is worth it. I would highly recommend it to my family and friends."
153,1961,"Apr 21 2009 	Nice Location Old Rooms	The location is great. The public areas of the hotel are stunning. The rooms are another story. They are old and dark and not well kept. When we asked to change rooms they told us they were all the same rather than trying to accomodate us. Also, at the end of our stay we found some outrageous fee on the bill that was associated with the &quot;free&quot; breakfast. Of course, we were told we had to pay this."
154,1961,"Apr 21 2009 	great location	We stayed here in january for week and had a really great time. The room was a good size with a really comfy bed that was huge!! Great to fall into after so much walking around!! The bathroom was nice and clean too. The location was great, really easy to get everywhere. We didnt try any food at the hotel so cant comment on that but everything else was great. Would definately stay there again."
155,1961,"Apr 21 2009 	Great Location Nice Hotel	Just got back from two nights at The Roosevelt Hotel with my two young kids and husband. We got a great rate and breakfast included. The hotel was a good find in a great location. Close to subway, walk to most mid-town tourist attractions. The room was a decent size, especially for NYC. The lobby was very lively and a beautiful space. Hard to go wrong with this moderatly priced hotel."
156,1961,"Apr 21 2009 	Great location problem with reservation lamps 	Except for the clerk the first night the Roosevelt staff were nice, especially the bellhops and concierges. The lobby is gorgeous and the location is really convenient. If you need wi-fi access go accross the street to Cosi where it is free. The hotel charges $15 per computer per 24-hr period.I had called ahead and notified the Roosevelt that we would be checking in very late (1-2 am) and they guaranteed late check-in. When the 3 of us arrived they did not have a room with 2 beds for us. They gave us a room with 1 king and promised a roll-away (saying they never guarantee the size of the beds). When I asked if they could do anything to make up for the inconvenience the clerk grudgingly wrote out a ticket so that each of us could have 1 pastry and 1 coffee each (my youngest is 12) at the breakfast bar and NOTHING ELSE! (her words). Forty minutes later they brought up a roll-away bed. They had to shove furniture around to squeeze it in. They couldn't fix the room assignment until the next day. As instructed we brought down our luggage to be stored in the morning. They had no safe available except in the rooms, and since we were without a room the girls had to carry their laptops which they had brought to do homework during the NYU tour we were attending (10-12:30). Finally, around 3:00 they were able to get us a room with 2 beds. In the new room, one lamp wouldn't turn off, so they replaced it. Then the safe didn't work, so they sent someone in who replaced the batteries. Then a different lamp stopped working, but at that point we just avoided that lamp. The window also jammed, but we eventually got it working."
157,1961,"Apr 20 2009 	Roosevelt - Very Very Central	I stayed in this Hotel with my wife and my parents for a week (April 2009). Rooms were not very big (but none are in Manhattan), but they were clean, had comfy bed and good shower. The hotel foyer is quite amazing.It is a very central location in Manhattan, perfect for seeing all the sights. It is right beside Grand Central Station and is 4 blocks (5-10 minute walk) from Times Square. Its about 10-15min walk from Central Park and 2 blocks away from 5th Avenue and Rockefeller Centre.We flew into Newark, got the NJ Transit train ($15) from Airport to Penn Station. Then we used the Subway to get to Grand Central.Line 1 from Penn Station one stop to Times Square, then S Shuttle line to Grand Central) We got a 7 day metro pass ($25), the best move we made as we used it to get all around Manhattan/Bronx/Queens on subway and buses.There is a good fitness centre in the Hotel, but no swimming pool. I used the fitness centre a few times, there were TVs on each machine and water machine as well.We didnt eat in the Hotel as the breakfast was probably a bit pricy. Have the adventure in NYC is going around all wee Deli bars for breakfast anyway. There are many of them.There are a few good restaurants nearby (Eamon Bar and Grill)  2min walk and the Perfect Pint (5min walk). They are not fine dining but good quality food.If you are looking for a central location to tour Manhattan, then the Roosevelt is the one for you."
158,1961,Apr 19 2009 	Very good bed in the heart of Manhattan	The room was kind of old and very small but it was clean and the bed was WOW~! The stuff was not so pleasant especially the concierge that let me to carry my own bags and then asked in not very nice way for a tip! The location is perfect: one block from the grand central. I cannot say that it was the perfect hotel but in the price I paid it was OK and I recommend on it.
159,1961,"Apr 15 2009	Rooms not ready until 7pm! Smelly smoking rooms difficult staff.	I booked two stays here for some friends coming from out of town. When we arrived to check in they were given a smoking room which smelled awful. The rooms have decent furnishings but if you are not a smoker, the smoking rooms are really disgusting. We were told they could not guarantee us a non smoking room upon our return but they would put a request in and it was 'very likely' they coul make it happen. When we returned at 3pm to check in again, the rooms were not ready. The wait for a smoking room was 2 HOURS the wait for a nonsmoking room was FOUR HOURS. We waited 2 and had to settle into another stinky room. The staff made no attempt to compensate us for the inconvenience and were rude when we would check to see if the room was ready. The second room was small and the bathroom wasn't well furnished. It looked tired and old.This hotel has some decent rooms and is in a good location. If the staff would simply make a bit of an effort it would have completely changed my review but under the circumstances I cannot recommend this place."
160,1961,"Apr 14 2009 	Pleasantly surprised!	I had booked this hotel as all the hotels were coming up really expensive and I was very nervous. I booked a petite room so wasn't expecting much! My husband and I were really surprised by the hotel, the entrance is very grand and the room was clean and nice enough, we were on the 17th floor so didn't get any nose. The bed was really comfy and the location was great. The staff on the reception and concierge desk are not very friendly but answer your questions! We had prebooked transfers from Newark airport which my husband swears he would never do again as it took so long but it was nice and easy! We also prebooked our bus tours which was excellent. We really enjoyed ourselves and would definitely stay at this hotel again and believe me I am fussy!"
161,1961,Apr 13 2009 	Mixed Bag	I stayed here for a week last summer. Front desk was fantastic; Sunday brunch was fantastic: room was very good; maid service good; Concierge desk was clueless on how to do their job; front doorman was a crook.
162,1961,"Apr 12 2009 	Have a hard time recommending this hotel	I'm well aware of NYC prices, so I think the location is good and the service is average; however, I found the rooms to be dingy and a tad on the dirty side. For the price, it's okay, but there are many more hotels with competitive pricing that are better value."
163,1961,"Apr 12 2009 	Elegant Lobby clean room great location	After reading mixed reviews, we were pleasantly surprised by friendly staff. Room was clean, although on the small side. Enjoyed hanging out in the lobby and bar. Location was excellent, with walking distance to Broadway, Times Square, Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Square. Internet charge is a rip-off, but we didn't use it. Breakfast way too expensive, but plenty of alternatives a block or two away."
164,1961,"Apr 11 2009 	Not That Bad but...	... you should know a few things so that you are not disappointed with your booking:The lobby is amazing.... I dont think this helps when you see your room.The room is fairly small, smaller than a Travel Lodge room in the UK.It does not have coffee making facilities.Your room may not be as clean as you would like it to be, but its really not bad.The windows do not look like they have been cleaned for years and it seems the air con unit filter needed a good clean too.... the good things were:The location is fab. It is a stones throw away from Grand Central so you can get to anywhere you need via the subway and 3 blocks away from the Comfort Diner, look it up on here, you won't regret a visit.The room had a safe, big enough for a small laptop, camera, camcorder and money etc to be locked away.The bed is very comfy, lovely shower/bath and well needed after a long day walking around NY!We didnt spend too much time in the room and overall for the price we paid we were happy. We would recommend it to friends and family, once we had mentioned the above!"
165,1961,Apr 11 2009 	Horrible	Booked a room a month in a advance with two double beds. Once we got there they said they only had rooms with king beds left and all they could say was &quot;sorry.&quot; What's the point of a reservation?
166,1961,"Apr 10 2009 	Friendly	Excellent service, friendly staff at front desk, bell hop very nice and accomadatingpooring rain, and gentleman at front of hotel hails me a cab sans umbrella"
167,1961,"Apr 10 2009 	Great first time to New York	This was my first time to New York &amp; after a long flight &amp; slightly dodgy transfer (booked through expedia, pre-paid yet driver tried to charge again-we just refused!) it was nice to arrive here!Hotel is very pretty inside &amp; is in a great location. Very close to everything we needed &amp; wanted to see. Loads of shops &amp; food places literally round the corner.Our room was slightly small, the bed filled most of it, but it really didn't matter, you don't come to New York to stay in your room! Plus I think I had in mind a suite like from pretty woman so I was going to think it was smaller than expected! lol! The bathroom &amp; the room were clean and we found no problems whatsoever!The staff were really helpful and I found this hotel to be perfect for all our needs, would definitely recommend &amp; would stay here again."
168,1961,"Apr 8 2009 	Location location and again location	Service (especially at the front desk) poor. No hello, no smile, no welcome, neutral reaction to all the guests. We (my husband and i) didn't pay any attention since we knew by the reviews and price not to expect something else. We drove from Toronto, Ontario (8 hours wonderful road trip) parking at the hotel is $55, if you take your car out more that once they charge you again. We stayed for 3 days and didn't use our car. The hotel is in perfect location you don't need a car at all. Rooms are small but OK, we requested a king size bed, looked like a queen, wish i had my measuring tape, just out of curiosity. Washrooms are outdated and looked dirty (our washroom had a closet ) Nice cafe right across the hotel, for lunch or breakfast. If you are taking an umbrella from reception make sure they do take it out of your bill when returning it. They almost charged us $25. Good hotel on the budget, but will not stay again. I'll look for something else."
169,1961,"Apr 7 2009 	Cheap by price 	We arrived at the hotel at 9pm on Friday night to discover that our booking had been lost. After a few phone calls to expedia.com and a confirmation fax being sent to the hotel, they finally agreed that we had a booking. Having said that they said they didn't have a room available!! It was 9pm, why wasn't there a room available?? I guess in the end they compensated us with two free drinks and an entree at their bar. Those drinks and entree were nice.The room was in pretty good shape however the bath was quite dirty. The water tended to clog up in the bath, which wasn't too appealing.The gym was quite good and catered for what I requiredAn issue I had was the cost of internet access. This will set you back an additional $15 or so per day. I found it much cheaper to go to a local Starbucks and use their cheaper internet. That was a bit of a disappointment.Overall the hotel was satisfactory for the money paid. It is about a 5-8 minute walk to times square. The location is pretty good considering. Worth a shot if you want something cheap, but not totally nasty"
170,1961,"Apr 6 2009 	Good Bargain	I got a deal from travelzoo - a $179/night rate for a King Superior Room including full breakfast for two each day of our visit. The room was clean and the location was superb. It is located one block from Grand Central Terminal, which is convenient for those taking subways.My only complain is that they ran out of breakfast vouchers and we had to go to the front desk each morning to get copies vouchers for breakfast. But the waitstaff in the Roosevelt Grill made up for this as they were very friendly and accommodating.I would certainly recommend."
171,1961,"Apr 6 2009 	Ideal Location	We stayed at the Roosevelt on our annual trip to NYC this year. The location is superb. Grand Central is literally across the street so subway access couldn't be more convenient. We arrived at 11:00 and were able to check in immediately before headed to the Village. The room was on the small size but it accommodated us. Bathroom was clean and shower pressure/hot water good. The rooms were not noisy and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. The hotel is located in a prime location making easy walks to Times Square &amp; the Rock however we tend to go off the beaten path for our entertainment. There is no coffee maker in the room but it is available in the lobby. We did not eat at the hotel but had a few drinks in the bar, which was lively both evenings we were there. Unless there is another great deal out there, we'll be back next year!"
172,1961,"Mar 24 2009 	Great hotel!	The hotel is great. I hinghly recommend it!It's very clean, the service y really good and has a great fitness area.Great location: steps from Madison Ave.It has an amazing lobby and a nice bar . The room service is really good, and the staff is always ready to help.I do recommend the Roosevelt Hotel."
173,1961,"Mar 24 2009 	Perfect location good hotel	I stayed in the Roosevelt with 3 friends, all their to celebrate our birthdays. Having read some of the previous reviews I was a little nervous about staying here but our experience was very good. We booked directly with the hotel and got a very good deal which included breakfast. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a huge choice. The rooms were quite small but clean and comfortable. The bed one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom was a little tired but clean and perfectly adequate. The staff I dealt with, with the very notable exception of the woman making waffles at breakfast who was extraordinarily rude, were helpful and polite. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and I would happily return."
174,1961,"Mar 21 2009 	Stunned	I have just read a review about the above Hotel and was stunned at the disgust of the writer. Its 18 months since I stayed there, but have visited there twice. First time in April 2001. This hotel was absolutely superb on both occasions. Rooms superb, staff friendly and efficient and food excellent.I hope to go to New York next year and will book at this hotel again."
175,1961,"Mar 20 2009 	Happy with this Hotel	This hotel was perfectly located for the things we like to do in Manhattan. We had a king room on the 9th floor and were very comfortable. The bathroom was small, but we managed fine. The service was better than average.A few areas for improvement: There was only one nightstand by the bed, which is somewhat inconvenient for two people. Also, the Starbucks coffee and breakfast items in the Madison Lounge were supposed to be available at 6:00, but were usually not ready until 6:15.We really enjoyed this hotel and look forward to staying here again."
176,1961,"Mar 18 2009 	Fantastic Location Good Hotel Great Holiday	Like many people, I read as many reviews as possible before deciding on a hotel in New York.....some of the reviews on here just have to be ignored. The Roosevelt is a very, very good choice for a week in New York.Firstly, the location. Perfect spot just off Madison Ave. Lovely short walk to Bloomingdales, Times Square, Macy's, Central Park, Empire State Building, Rockerfella Centre, Chrysler Building. If you walk out the front of the hotel and cross the road, there is a door marked Grand Central Station. Within 2 mins you are in the main concourse. Perfect if you need trains/subway.TIP - Turn left out the main entrance on 46th Street and walk 4 blocks (past Met Life Centre on right). The Comfort Diner is a perfect place for breakfast, or lunch, or dinner! Great staff. What us English would descibe as a proper New York diner. I cannot recommend this place highly enough, and really set us up for the day.Second, the hotel and staff. If your the sort of person that gives a hotel rating a 1 star if someone doesn't say hello back to you, then you really need help! Check in was excellent. Arrived 1pm, room not ready. Stored luggage and was told to come back at 3pm. Had a drink in the bar and a local stroll in the snow and got back at 3pm. Room still not ready - BUT, I did not complain, just stayed silent for a few seconds and the lady gave us a free upgrade to a King Room. The room itself wasn't massive, so I would imagine a cozy Queen is very small, BUT it was clean, flatscreen tv, small but fine bathroom with a good shower. No complaints. The bed was excellent. TIP - if you are given a room opposite the lifts, change (as in any hotel). There are no tea/coffee facilities but there is a small coffee shop directly opposite and a Starbucks serving from the hotel bar in the morning.We avoided room service as it looked horrendously over-priced.The lobby is beautiful. It really takes you back to a grand hotel from the 30's. The bar next to the lobby is very busy, but we always found a table. WARNING - Drinks are very expensive. $15 - $20 for a cocktail and just under $10 for a pint. We had a few drinks as it was such a nice location and atmosphere, but I wouldn't advise going on an all day session unless you re-mortgaged the house before you came out.We stayed for seven nights and 2 of the nights had roadworks till past midnight....BUT I'm not going to mark a hotel down for that! Also one night had a big Jewish wedding so there was alot of corridor noise, but again only because we were near the lifts.We had no problem with the staff at all. If you feel someone deserves a tip, give them one. Never at any point did we feel pressured to tip anyone. I would recommend the hotel car back to the airport. That little bit of luxury is a perfect way to round the holiday off, and probably works out the same cost ($55) than the yellow cab ($45 + tip and tolls).The rooms were ok, but like everyone says, the only time you should spend in your room in New York is either getting ready to go out or sleeping.All in all, the hotel and location was the perfect place to spend the week in which I proposed to my girlfriend. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was staying in New York."
177,1961,"Mar 16 2009 	Excellent Time at the Roosevelt!	My mom, sister and I stayed at the Roosevelt from February 23 - March 1st and really cannot say anything negative about our experience!Our flight arrived at JFK early in the morning and we arrived at the Roosevelt before 8am. Our room was not ready for us at the time, but our luggage was happily taken care of for us and we were invited to return earlier than the regular check-in time should we choose as the front desk agent was sure our room would be ready by 1pm at the latest. I had originally booked a Cozy Queen room as part of an Expedia package as my mom and I had planned on traveling just the two of us, however when my sister decided to come, we called the hotel ahead of time and asked our room to be changed. As we had an extra person travelling with us, I fully expected to pay for the room upgrade, however we weren't charged anything!We had a great room with 2 double beds, clean bathroom and room, plenty of room for our luggage and a nice view of 46th Street. The beds were very comfortable, there was some noise outside at night from the garbage trucks working overtime to keep the streets clean, however all three of us slept very well. All but one morning we started our day by running down to the lounge in the lobby for bagels, fruit and coffee. Very conveinent, the staff were friendly, courteous, lovely.The hotel lobby was absolutely beautiful. Constantly busy as meeting and conferences were going on almost all the time. I never once felt unsafe in the hotel or the city for that matter! The hotel location is superb. With Grand Central just a block away, it's easy to get anywhere from the hotel! Also, at 47th and Madison is an excellent caf, Caf Metro. Highly recommend going there for amazing soups and salads. Perfect if you want to grab some food to take back to the hotel.At no time during our entire stay did I ever feel like I had to tip anyone working at the Roosevelt. We left a few dollars everyday in the room for the maid service, and tipped the Bellmen when they retrieved our luggage for us from storage upon our arrival and when we left the hotel. The gentlemen working outside taking care of the taxi's/towncars helped us out, never implying or indicating a sense of entitlement when it came to tips.I highly recommend the Roosevelt to anyone looking for the quintessential New York experience. I cannot wait to return!"
178,1961,"Mar 16 2009 	Total Lack of Service	I chose the Roosevelt for a weekend trip because of its great location and reasonable rates. I was totally unprepared for the complete lack of service. It was unlike anything I've ever experienced. I arrived by taxi and there was no doorman or anyone at the entrance of the hotel to take my bags. I carried them up a short flight of stairs to the lobby and checked in. I was not offered the services of a bellman to accompany me to my room or to help me with my bags. The room was small, especially the bathroom, but it was adequate. During my 3 night stay, the only other contact I had with the hotel staff was when I turned on the hair dryer and all of the lights in the room went out. I called down to the desk and a hotel maintenance worker arrived fairly promptly to remedy the situation and explain that someone in the next room was using a hair dryer at the same time! This should not be a problem at a HOTEL where using a hair dryer in the morning is NOT an uncommon thing! Overall I would say that the location is outstanding, the hotel itself is just ok, and the staff is totally disinterested."
179,1961,"Mar 15 2009 	Horrible	Problems with Roosevelt Hotel in New York City: At 2:20 am the front desk calls &amp; says they had a complaint that our Tv was too loud. I told the woman that they were mistaken because our Tv was not on and we had been asleep for hours. as my sis and I are 62 &amp; 64 yrs. old.She then said I am warning you that if this happens again security will be called to knock on your door. I explained again that she was mistaken but she was very rude and continued to threaten me. I went down to the lobby and she was the only one there and I asked for the mananger and a man came to me with a phone in hbis hand.I made a complaint with the night mananger and then again with the day manager the next day.I was told that they would get back to me but no one ever did. We were not able to go back to sleep that night and because we were so tired .We were there for several more days and no one ever contacted us. When we left on 3/01 we both filled out a comment card and explained the incident. We have not heard anything from them at allfrom the Hotel. They woke us us in the middle of the night for something we did not do, then threatened us.We were awake the rest of the night.It was a terrible and costly experiance. that was quite scarry. The room was small but fine. The Tv was good. The view from our window that they claimed had a &quot;view&quot; was the inside of the hotel looking at all the airconditioning units and the other wall of the hotel."
180,1961,"Mar 13 2009 	Great NYC hotel for business travelers	Grand old hotel. Rooms are partially renovated and larger and cleaner that most NY rooms. Hotel has large lobby with a busy bar and a restaurant. The location is great for meetings - near many of the larger banking and finance companies. For the price, one of the better deals in NY for business travelers."
181,1961,"Mar 13 2009 	Rude Staff	After few days staying at the hotel without problem, an incident with Wendy the receptionist and her so-called manager was enough for saying I and my employees would never stay again to the Roosevelt hotel.- Wendy the Receptionist rude and baring call because some of the colleague names were not matching the room number on her computer. All rooms were registered on one name.- She has been rude with people trying to reach room by phone, with her 'gangsta' attitude! - Her &quot;so -manager&quot; telling me he would press charge against the persons staying in the room where the name aren't theirs, saying they were staying illegally in the hotel after 4 nights. Shocked! All filled a form upon arrival! - Received better services in budget hotels around the world including 3rd world country.- Just unbelievable."
182,1961,"Mar 11 2009 	Great location but shabby place	This is really well located in central Manhattan but it is in desperate need of a refurb, and in fact simply looks shabby. The room we stayed in was extremely cramped and noisy (although to be fair, you have to expect this in Manhattan!).It wasn't unpleasant and didn't ruin the holiday, I would just expect a lot better for the money"
183,1961,"Mar 10 2009 	Amazing experience	It was amazing to enter the lobby and all of its charm. Checkin in was done quickly without any problems by a friendly staff member. Got a room on the 9th floor facing 46th street. The room was very big with a 32&quot; flatscreen and a wonderful comfortable king size bed. I suspect I was upgraded as the room I paid for was a &quot;cozy room with a queen size bed&quot; but this room was so much more. The bathroom was big and very clean. The decor was a bit worn out in the room but again everything was sparkling clean. The room was cleaned every day and the sheets/towels was changed at the same time. The fitness room on the 2nd floor was very nice and cleaned everyday. Also fresh fruit was available. I did not use the restaurant or roomservice as the prices seemed a little bit on the expensive side, but due to the hotels excellent location there is a lot of cafes and reataurants nearby. In general the staff was friendly but not too many smiles and their general knowledge of the hotel offerings (like webzone etc) was not impressive. Checkin out was again done quickly and with no fuzz and when I stored my luggage for a couple of hours the bellboys was friendly and very helpful also when I picked up the luggage. Only concern I had was the aircondition. It was kinda old and a bit noisy. Fortunately it was not necessary to use it when I stayed there. I spent 8 nights at the hotel and I enjoyed every minute of it."
184,1961,"Mar 7 2009 	Best hotel superb clean fantastic location ticks all the boxes for me	We ( 2 best mates ) stayed here at the end of Jan into Feb and what a lovely hotel. We arrived to see the amazing lobby it is breathtaking and makes it feel that bit more special.The check-in lady was really lovely and as we told her it was our 30th birthdays she upgraded us to a king suite for free ! They do ask for a $100 deposit for breakages but you get it back if no damage is done.The room we were given was on the 14th floor and the view was of some offices but we weren't bothered as we weren't there for that ! The room that greeted us was very clean,tastefully decorated and had two double beds ! One each ! The bed was soooo comfy and there was peace and quiet apart from the humming of traffic and honking of taxi horns- very NYC ! The bathroom had a decent shower/bath and they provide you with complimentary toiletries, fluffy white towels and a hair dryer ! There was cable tv and decent 37' plasma tv to watch it on. The only criticism is that there are no tea/coffee making facilities and you have to fill up a bucket of ice to keep your drinks cold - we used to buy a big carton of orange juice and stick it in the ice and that did us ! There are vending machines for fizzy drinks but I wouldn't waste the money.You can get room service but it is expensive. The Madison Bar in the hotel serves a variety of alcohol, cocktails coffee etc. Be warned it is expensive but if you are splashing out - well worth it ! Cocktails are around $15 each! We would highly recommend this hotel - tip a yellow cab to JFK airport is $45 + tip and tolls - for the same money we got a limo ($55) to the airport from the hotel and it is the ultimate way to spend the last few hours in this glorious city - the position is excellent for times square, empire state, rockerfeller centre, broadway, central park and generally everywhere - I will be staying here again when I visit what I call a home from home"
185,1961,"Mar 4 2009 	amazing	Got a great deal, just amazing hotel. Great location!! Service ok, rooms were nice. Not even as small as NYC rooms usually are. Got upgraded for free on our arrival. We stayed for 8 nights. Only negative thing was that the hotel airport transfer is expensive.Beds were so comfy!! Just love the old, real NY feeling!"
186,1961,"Mar 3 2009 	Good hotel great location	Stayed for 2 nights while attending a conference. Room was small and furnishings a bit worn (but a new flat screen TV), but everything was clean and in good working order. Unlike some others, I was able to manage the climate controls, though it took some time. The staff was efficient, if somewhat diffident. The location is excellent for anything in Midtown. I would definitely stay there again for business travel."
187,1961,"Mar 3 2009 	Very disappointed	Wanted to treat myself to one of the &quot;Grand Dames&quot; of NYC Hotels. While the lobbyand restaurant are beautiful, the rest of the hotel was a disappointment. Because I checked in before 3:00, had to leave my bags. That's when everything fell apart. Sent to 3 different places to leave bags. Very disorganized. Long lines. Like being at the airport. Never had to go thru that at any other hotel. Then when I arrived that evening, no one was there to get my bags.Front desk had to call bell hop who insisted that he bring it to my room instead of me waiting for it. Guess why? When he brought it to my tiny, very warm room, he stood there and stared at me until I tipped him (for doing his job...late)."
188,1961,"Mar 2 2009 	This hotel was great we just simply loved it	My boyfriend and i spent 5 days at the Roosevelt and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The location was perfect The room size was ok to us we didn't have anything to complain about. The room was always clean and the sheets fresh and crisp. The bathroom was also clean and whilst small it was just fine for the both of us. May i just add that the bed was soooo comfortable we proceeded to change our bed as soon as we came back from our holiday as we could no longer bear the thought of sleeping on a less than the Roosevelt standard type of bed i could write a whole lot about the bed... The tv was nice there was a wide range of tv shows, movies, news on tv. The hotel food was nice though a little expensive i would definitely recommend the Roosevelt hotel to my family and friends in fact next time i'm in NYC i'll probably go back there."
189,1961,"Feb 28 2009 	Superb hotel in a great location	My partner and i stayed at the Roosevelt hotel in New York city for 5 days over Valentines weekend 2009. When we arrived we were greeted by very friendly staff who are willing to help. When we checked in we were upgraded to a better room free of charge as they were a couple of better rooms spare. All of tehotel staff are very polite and willing to help the porters are very helpful and will give yu any advice you need.The hotel is very modern and the whole appearence is fantastic. Our room was great we had a huge bed and we had everything we needed in the room. The maidskept the rooms clean and tidy on a daily basis and are not in anyway intrusive. Thre is a wide choice of room service options in required.We could not have asked for a better located hotel, The Roosevelt is very well situated for Central park Rockefella centre and anything else you would wish to see/do whilst staying in NYC all with in a short walk/ Taxi ride away with some very good bars and deli's close by. Grand central station is 200yards from the hotel so commuting from the hotel is made very easy indeed. I would highly recommend Gordon Ramsay's &quot;Maze&quot; restauant which is at the London Hotel, And for more less informal dining there is &quot;Eamon's bar and grill &quot; which is 2 mins walk from the hotel. The hotel itself has a very good restaurant ad a shop which is open for much of the day. We were thoroughly impressed with our stay at the Roosevelt hotel and would happily return there if we decide to go back to NYC. I would highly recommend tis hotel to anyone planning on visiting NYC. I think for hotel atmoshpere, staff performance and room service quality this is one of the best hotels i have stay in outside of the UK."
190,1961,"Feb 24 2009 	good value clean and comfortable	This was my husband and I's 2nd stay at the Roosevelt. We had previously stayed there for new year's eve 2007-2008 and got upgraded to a king minisuite. This time we weren't so lucky, but the room was nice anyway. We were on the 9th floor and it was a bit of street noise on Friday afternoon but it was quiet in Saturday. It was clean and decently sized for NYC, and the bed was very comfortable. The towels were thick and the water pressure in the shower was great. We got a special deal that included free breakfast vouchers in the dining room. The food was adequate, with a good choice of hot dishes such as eggs, bacon, sausages, waffles, pancakes, and the usual cereal, bagels, toast, and juice or coffee. What we weren't told was that they charge you a $12 gratuity when you use the vouchers...and we had left a cash tip on the table. Oh well. Also, this hotel charges for internet service, which, for the price of the rooms, I think should be free. Regardless, the location is great, the staff is very friendly and we would definitely stay here again."
191,1961,"Feb 23 2009 	great value and location	Yes, the cozy queen is really small but that is true of many hotel rooms in NYC. The room was nicely appointed, comfortable bed, and the bathroom recently remodeled--quite nice. The lobby is great, good bar and we found the staff helpful. The window opened which I feel is very important and this room was oriented to the interior of the block on a high floor so relatively quiet (for NYC). While you may not get an upgrade, it is always reasonable to ask for a quiet room with a window that opens. Tip, don't lug your bags up the stairs upon arrival, walk around to the right and down the hall to the elevators. And I can't say enough about the location--my favorite hotel area in the city because you can get everywhere quickly and easily. We stayed for a week and would definitely stay here again."
192,1961,"Feb 23 2009 	Great Hotel!!!!!	This was the perfect hotel in an absolute perfect location (1.5 blocks from Grand Central Station and 5 blocks from Times Square). The staff was friendly and helpful with everything from taking care of our bags to recommending restaurants and making reservations. What the rooms lack in size, they make up for in comfort and cleanliness. I would definitely stay here again and have no problems recommending the Roosevelt to anyone who is thinking of going to NYC."
193,1961,"Feb 23 2009 	Great Hotel - Great Location	Great hotel in a real good location. Stayed with my GF for 4 nights had a great value for money deal with Expedia. (Who had a precious bad experience with). Room nice clean and roomy. Can be noisy though we were on the 11th floor.Nice helpful staff on arrival, one member of staff very rude but othe than that great. Arranged a limo for return...... ( Take change no change on arrival at airport).TIP : Dont take a lift outside airport from unmarked cars off guys ahnging around in arrivals. Guy drove off with Gf's handbag and didnt return. Take Yellow Cab and note cab number just in case. No cheaper either"
194,1961,"Feb 22 2009 	What a great anniversary!	We booked our trip on Priceline and paid $115 a night (cozy queen). I called and asked for a king bed and they said they would mark our reservation with the request. When we checked in I told them it was our anniversary and they upgraded us again.We had a big, clean comfortable king room on the 11th floor. The location was perfect and it was nice to have the doorman to get us a cab when we needed one. We were happy to tip but we did not feel obligated or pressured to do so.Wonderful trip.Anne"
195,1961,"Feb 21 2009	It was so New York	I would highly recommend this hotel if you can afford it now - since 'Maid in Manhattan' (starring J-Lo) was filmed here I understand it has become quite expensive to stay here. However, It is in a fantastic location adjacent Grand Central Station and within easy walking distance of Broadway, Times Square and in the other direction, Central Park. When we travelled the hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. We never ate in the hotel so can't comment on food but we did use the adjacent deli for breakfast which was very good &amp; great fun - the price is based on weight of your plate full! It is a fabulous hotel; tasteful, elegant and very comfortable. It is old style grandeur without being stuffy and truly contributed to our New York experience."
196,1961,"Feb 20 2009 	Upgraded!!! For no reason!!!	Me and my girlfriend visited the roosevelt for 3 nights over valentines. We got to the front desk and were upgraded to a king superior room. OUR BED WAS MASSIVE! Nice room and clean with a plasma screen. The bathroom was a little dated and the bath was so shallow and the top drain in the bath was so low, so to have a decent bath you had to have the water running at all times, no both though, at least it was hot. Apart from this the room was so nice and what little time we spent in our room was comfortable. The lobby is amazing, nice classic marble and gold effect with a nice bar, however a beer and lemonade was $11 (a little expensive) but all hotels are. Overall we loved the roosevelt and would definately stay there again. BTW position was fantastic- 5th Ave 1 min walk, grand central 30 secs walk, times square 10 mins walk. Great!!!"
197,1961,"Feb 16 2009 	Great location and OK for the price	hotelbook.com were selling rates at $149.00 (before tax and service) so quite a good rate. I was here for only two nights on business and because of my schedule (and the weather) didn't get to go out too much. That said, the hotel is in a fabulous location with very easy walking up to Saks 5th Avenue, or a stones throw from Grand Central Station. This is a grand old hotel that might have seen it's day but generally has a nice feel to it. Check-in was quick and efficient and the corner room allocated was nice. The bed was well supplied with pillows etc but the same old slanting/tired mattress that you see in so many hotels these days, spoiled the chance of good sleep. The bathroom was OK but shower curtains just get in the way of a decent shower. (Why do hotels still have these unhealthy things?). Room service was good, if a tad pricey (as was the WiFi access) but my fault for not having time to venture out to the many eating places around the hotel. This is a HUGE old style NY hotel that has certainly seen the best of it's days, but has a few more to give having such a fab location. If you want an independent hotel with few airs and graces but a great place in the city - give The Roosevelt a thought."
198,1961,"Feb 15 2009 	We Love The Roosevelt Hotel	My boyfriend and I booked the Roosevelt on a great deal through the Expedia website, and paid around 700 for a queen room (named a 'cosy queen' - petite but big enough) for eight nights. We thought it was excellent value for money.We arrived at around 3pm and were greeted by a friendly doorman. We were checked in very quickly by a slightly frosty member of staff, but after a few jokes she did relax and even gave us a useful tip - that calling home was very expensive from the room and that we could buy an inexpensive calling card from a nearby drugstore.We were shown to the room, which as I said was compact but very nice. There was a decent size built-in wardrobe and a dressing table. There was no chest of drawers which was a bit of a pain so we did have to keep most of our stuff in our suitcases.One thing that amused us was that they had installed a very nice large flatscreen TV, but the wiring was a joke! The hub was just bolted to the middle of the wall and the wires were everywhere.The bathroom was clean and we had a bath/shower, but it did look a little dated compared to other hotels.The best thing about the room was the bed! It was the comfiest bed either of us had ever slept in - both firm and soft at the same time if that's possible?!The room was a great base and because the hotel was so well placed next to Grand Central Station we were able to pop back during the day if we wanted, for a rest and/or a romantic interlude....The hotel was well placed for a quick walk to Times Square, a reasonable stroll to Central Park, and a few minutes to the metro at Grand Central.We did struggle to start with to find nice places for breakfast but eventually found Pershing Square which did delicious breakfasts - recommend the eggs benedict - and the Central Cafe where the salads and the sesame chicken were very good. Beware though - some of the buffet was stone cold!The only criticism we'd have is that the doormen were a little mercenary. We tipped $2 or $3 for every interaction that involved someone carrying our bags - not bad considering the distance was usually only about 3 feet!It was obvious that they all compared notes on who was a good tipper, because when we stored our bags on the last day for a couple hours, the doorman got $2, and when we went to collect them the guy who got them out was reluctant to help and just put them outside the door of the storage cupboard and made no effort to help us take them out the front of the hotel!When we left, we went to hail a yellow taxi back to JFK, which costs a flat fare of $45 (which rises to $60 when you factor in the $5 toll tunnel and a tip). The doorman muscled in and practically bundled us into the hotel limousine, saying that it was a flat fare of $55. Hardly seemed a bargain but this guy wasn't asking - he was telling. Anyway, the limo was fine and I only ended up paying $62 including tip, so there wasn't much in it. Incidentally the driver took a more circuitous route that avoided the toll tunnel, so he saved the $5 there. The journey took a little longer as a result but it wasn't a problem for us.All in all, our stay was very enjoyable and we would definitely go back."
199,1961,"Feb 15 2009 	Good hotel great location	My partner and I traveled to New York in November 2008 and decided to stay at the Roosevelt Hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. The check-in process was fast and easy, people at the reception desk friendly and helpful. The room we stayed in was in very good conditions, not big, but not small neither. The bed was very good, the bathroom was OK and clean. Location was great, within walking distance of the Central Station, 5th Avenue and Times Square. Only downside: the price of drinks at the bar, and of the food at the restaurant. Better off to eat and drink outside the hotel."
200,1961,"Feb 14 2009 	Convenient but typical old NY hotel	The best thing about the Roosevelt is the location right in midtown. Very convenient to Grand Central, Rockefeller Center, and Times Square etc. The rooms are tiny as you would expect. Our window faced a fire escape. Could hardly put our suitcases in the room without tripping over everything. Bed was good though, very comfy. Bathroom okay, no room to put 2 toilet bags.Lift is terrible. Wait for 10 minutes at least. A lot of people enter via the basement and slow everything down. We were on the 12th floor and honestly it's better to walk down if you are not burdened by cases. Very very busy but then it was July so couldn't expect anything else. Room service is patchy. If you have an issue, don't expect to resolve it over the phone. Save yourself the trouble and go down to the lobby and sort it out there.Lobby overcrowded and nowhere to sit. People were queueing for a place to park themselves while they waited for service or the concierge. Again, it was July I know, but that's when you see a hotel at its worst. Staff seemed inured to the chaos. Concierge was very good on the other hand, knew everything about tickets, restaurants, subway etc. This is also an aircrew hotel so sometimes a couple of crews will be checking in and out in front of you. Can't imagine how frustrating it must be for them to stay here, though.Wouldn't want to stay here more than a couple of nights. If you are staying a week or so, bite the bullet and find an apartment hotel or condo for short stays. If we had to stay in that tiny room for a week my partner and I would have murdered each other probably.Bottom line: standard old NY hotel. Great location for tourists. Reasonably priced for what it is. Just don't expect anything special."
201,1961,"Feb 11 2009 	Great location with some faults	My daughter and I stayed at the Roosevelt the weekend of Feb.6-8. The trip was a surprise to celebrate her birthday. We were seeing 2 shows and doing alot of shopping so the location was perfect. We were able to take the airtrain and the subway from JFK to the 5th Ave/53rd St. stop and walk the 8 blocks- very easy (50 minutes). It is also only two blocks to catch the subway at Grand Central to go downtown. I had booked the hotel through Expedia and got a rate of 118 (this included the taxes), which is why I chose it! The room I booked was a &quot;cozy queen&quot; but we were upgraded to a king upon arrival. The room was on the 7th floor with a view of the interior (this reduced noise at night, although this is a quiet area of midtown). Our room wasn't big but all we did was sleep there. There was no coffee maker but Blake and Todds across the street had great breakfasts and coffee. The bathroom was small and the tub didn't drain well but we managed just fine. Our room wasn't cleaned on Saturday even though we were gone from 9:30 until 5:00. Since we were only there 2 nights I wasn't too concerned about it, and I didn't feel bad not leaving a tip for the maid. The concierge held our bags on Sunday for us for no charge. I have stayed at the Parc Central, Warwick, Intercontinental, and Wellington and for the price this was perfect. I would much rather have the money in my pocket to spend on other things while in the city."
202,1961,"Feb 11 2009 	Excellent!	This hotel was absolutely brilliant! I was nervous initially as some of the reviews on here are a little negative.Check in was prompt and friendly, although as it was for my 21st birthday i think we were going to be offered an upgrade, until they realised that what booked through expedia. what difference that makes???? i dont know!But the room given was lovely and we were on the 12th floor and far far away from the lifts so it was soooo quiet. However i did take earplugs just incase. The bed linen and bathroom was clean and it was of a really good size too. As it was our first time to New York, location was very important and this hotel was in the perfect place! we walked EVERYWHERE and only got a cab to and from the airport. Obviously you need to be in reasonably good shape to do that but it worked well for us. We didnt seem to have a probem with staff expecting tips, however do make sure that you carry lots of $1 bills, otherwise you may find yourself giving $5 for a guy to carry 2 bags down three stairs like we did!!"
203,1961,"Feb 10 2009 	all around bad experience	I have traveled to NY several times and stayed in many different classes of hotels, but I can say that the Roosevelt was the first time that I was ever Unpleasantly surprised at the condition of the property, relative to what I paid.Short review: NOT RECOMMENDED if you plan to pay via debit card, gorgeous lobby, RUDE staff, filthy guest areas, cramped rooms, broken equipment (windows, A/C, etc.), you will be asked directly for tips by nearly everyone on hotel staff, NOT WORTH THE PRICE. Full review: &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; goes double in Manhattan, but seeing as how I had paid over $200 per night and was staying for 5 days, I expected much more than I received from my trip (2/5-2/9/2009). That being said, I may have felt better about staying in an outdated room if I had paid a lot less, but I still wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone based on the terrible service.It was partially my fault for not reading reviews before I booked the hotel, which all seem to echo my same problems. I think that a lot of the reviewers on Trip Advisor must have stayed in my same room!Pros:- location, proximity to Grand Central/Midtown Manhattan- beautiful lobby- comfortable bedCons: - doormen are pushy and rude and will demand a tip for opening your taxi door (I saw this happen to other people too and when one person apologized that he didn't have any cash, the doorman gave him directions to the nearest ATM and told him what his shift hours were!)- the arcade (shopping mall) that is on the ground floor of the hotel closes in the early evening and after it closes, there is no elevator service from the 1st floor. You HAVE to climb/carry your bags up 2 flights of stairs. (note for travelers who have problems with stairs)- no offer of assistance with taking luggage up the stairs. For me, it wasn't a problem since I only had small bags, but if someone had larger luggage, they'd have to make several trips- front desk staff was very rude, right from the start. I made my reservation by telephone, and when I checked in it looked like I had made 2 reservations and initially the woman at the front desk wanted to charge me a 'late cancellation fee' for not needing the 2nd room. After standing my ground and refusing to pay for it, she relented and checked me in. - I was planning to use my debit card for payment and initially was unable to because the hotel REQUIRES a pre-authorization of the total room &amp; tax amount plus $100 per day &quot;for incidentals&quot;. In my case, this was over $1400, and I have a daily transaction limit on my debit card of $500, so I couldn't use it. **the reason I include this as a &quot;con&quot; is that I worked in the travel industry for many years and I currently travel 10+ times per year and I have NEVER seen a hotel require a pre-auth for the total amount, plus incidentals. Typically, they pre-auth 1 night room &amp; tax and the guest has a right to have the ability to charge any incidentals &quot;blocked&quot; on their account (this means that they can't use the phone for long distance, order pay-per-view, etc.).** - due to the pre-authorization issues above, I had to use a separate credit card for the &quot;guarantee&quot; and make staggered payments every couple of days on my debit card to keep each charge under $500 [this is my bank's policy, which may not be a problem for other people]. However, each time I would make a payment, the front desk staff would act like it was the most difficult thing in the world. One woman even asked me to not do it and instead go to a bank and withdraw all the cash that I could and pay that way so that she didn't have to do a computer entry. That wasn't an option, so she grudgingly made the payment but was very hostile about it and at the end threw the card on the counter at me and walked away. I've never had anyone give me such a hard time about giving them money!- ALSO, each time I made a payment, the woman told me, I would have to be pre-authorized AGAIN so that a separate hold would be put on my credit card. Each time, it would be $1400, regardless of how long I had already been there. For me, this wasn't a problem, but for anyone else trying the same thing, they'd need to be able to charge $1400 x 3 (number of payments I made with my debit card) = $4200. This does not make ANY sense and no one could explain it.- Room problem: key reader in door would only work intermittently, needed card to be swiped 15-20 times before it would read- Room problem: A/C was extremely noisy (sounded like a jackhammer). Also, A/C is in the window, so curtains had to be kept open to get the cool air into the room.- Room problem: dresser was at the foot of the bed, about 10&quot; from the mattress. Cannot pull suitcase through this space. I also hit my hip/leg on the sharp corners several times- Room problem: bathtub wouldn't hold water, drain seal was broken. Very low water pressure, took about 20 minutes to fill up bath tub (drained out with stopper closed in about 5 minutes). - Room problem: TV static, unable to watch any programs- I called the manager on duty and explained the problems with my room and was scrutinized. After having to justify why I needed a room change, I was told that there were &quot;no rooms available&quot; but that I could check out at noon and I would need to leave my luggage at the bell desk and they would see what they could do. IF there was a room, it would not be ready until after 4pm and I might have to take a smoking room.- At this point, I wanted to just change hotels, but the cancellation policy is 24 hours so I'd already have to pay for the current day PLUS they charge $75 fee for cancelling once your stay has started. Again, I have NEVER heard of this at any other hotel.- Bellmen unhelpful and pushy - There was a man sitting at the bell desk who did not actually help anyone, but instead would just point to where you should stand until someone else came along. The man who came eventually was a very old man with a pronounced limp. He was obviously in no condition to haul my bags, so I carried them myself (up a set of 3 stairs) to the closet where the bags are stored. Once I was given my claim check, both the old man and the man at the desk hit me up for tips, even though neither had done ANYTHING whatsoever. I felt obligated to tip them both, since I would be back in a few hours to collect my bags and didn't want them to get &quot;lost&quot; in the closet.- Housekeeping staff needs to watch their foul language. 2 of the housekeeping ladies were talking in the hall (I passed right next to them and they very clearly saw me) about a guest who had the Do Not Disturb sign on their door and said &quot;if that [-] doesn't want her [-] room cleaned right now then [-] her and she can wait until tomorrow because I'm going on my my [-] break!&quot;- Got a new room, but it was even worse. I was basically downgraded to a smaller room with the same aesthetic problems and fewer functional ones. A/C did work, but was actually a window unit with a poor patchwork seal. So the noise from the city poured in and the curtains had to be kept open to feel the air. Card reader in the door was spotty. - Hallways were FILTHY. The edges of the rugs had not been vacuumed in a very long time -- the dark green carpets showed the dust too well. Entire hallway smelled like musty garbage.- Rooms were very dingy and dusty, not well-cleaned. The crown moldings looked horribly beat-up and the wallpaper was peeling. - elevators were slow and rickety. I feel fortunate that we didn't get trapped!- Would have been nice: if the lights in the hallway weren't so bright. They shine in the room at night under the door and through peep hole and lighten up the whole place. (this is in addition to all the city light coming in the window because the curtains can't be closed).- Would have been nice: if there were more pillow options. The pillows on the bed were all extra firm, and I ended up with a neck ache every morning. I would NOT ever stay again. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who plans to stay for several days. If there was a tremendous deal, say $120 a night, and you're only there for a day or two, then it might be a fair trade for the hassle. But the staff here really dragged down my entire trip this time."
204,1961,"Feb 10 2009 	Rooms Are Basic	My wife went for a conference and I came up a couple of days later. The rooms are a nice size but the amenities are few. No Coffee maker in the room. The ironing board was never put away and the beds were just straightened, not changed. The bath room is small. There is no separate vanity and no counter space. It is a pedestal sink. Good for a couple of nights but not for a long stay."
205,1961,"Feb 10 2009 	Fab location	We stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel from 2nd Feb till the 7th Feb 2009. We got a taxi from JFK which including tolls came to just under $50. We arrived at the hotel at about 4.30-5pm joined the small queue to check in. Check in was really easy just give your name show some photo ID (passport) and they need a credit card to authorise for any incidentals. I only had my bank card so handed that over but nothing was charged. We were booked into a cozy room but were upgraded at check in to a superior room. Sounds good but the only difference is the room is slightly bigger and has 2 double beds. The beds were really comfy if not slightly small , but we have a big bed at home so could just be us. The bathroom was compact but perfectly fine. The hotel is incredibly warm so we had to have the air on nearly all the time but you get used to it. Our room was on the 16th floor it was cleaned everyday and we had fresh towels everyday. This hotel is ideal if you are going to be out exploring New york everything is within walking distance and grand central station is just across the road. We didn't eat in the hotel although it did look nice we ate out as it was cheaper. When it was time to leave we checked out which just involved us handing over our door key and asked the doorman to order us a car, we got a lincoln town car back to JFK which was $60 including tip."
206,1961,Feb 6 2009 	This hotel practices credit card fraud	Stayed there 12-26-2008 for the Mid-Winter Special for $209 including room and breakfast buffet for two. The checkout bill correctly had the $209 + taxes. Later my credit card had another $56 as a second charge. WELL ... after several phone calls and being hung up on by rude staff (everyone who works there is miserable). They charged me another $56 for breakfast that was already included. After wasting too much time on phone I file a Dispute with AMEX and that takes 2 months to get money and is a hassle. I spoke to a lady Pearl in Accounting Dept ... who does not return phone calls and is basically a liar.Now that I think of it it is 2nd time this has happened here .... I think it is a part of their routine
207,1961,"Feb 3 2009 	Fabulous location and great hotel!	My partner and I stayed here from the 17th Jan for a week. It was a perfect place to stay!The only drawback was on the last day, they stored our luggage, and when we went to get them to go to the airport, They said &quot;this service is free, however a gratuatary tip is often given&quot; All her did was carry my case down one flight of stairs (3 in total) and then made to feel uncomfortable when we were resting in the lobby afterwards and as we left.Anyway, DONT LET THAT PUT YOU OFF......The hotel is in a perfect location for Times Square, Central Park, 5th Avenue, Bloomingdales, Macy's and the main sights! Times square was only a 10 minute walk, and that was walking slowly. Walking up 5th Ave to central park was about 20 minutes, or about 5 hours if you stop in the shops.Metlife building is litterally accross the road where you can get to Grand Central, or, if you go out of the main door of the hotel, straight accross the road is a tiny entrance to Grand Central!! You would nt notice it unless you where next to it.The room was clean and a good size. with a nice plasma HD tv, but when in new york do you spend it in the room?? The only time we did was to recharge batteries on the camara and legs.The maids were friendly and always said hello and reception staff were pleasent, so i do not know what other people are on about!Ask for a high floor, then you get better views. We had a view of the rockerfella."
208,1961,"Feb 2 2009 	Positive:Location----Negative:Staff	There are a few good things about this hotel. The location and the breakfast buffet are both terrific. You won't have to rely on the subway or taxi to get you anywhere. So much is within walking distance...the Minskoff Theater where Lion King is playing, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, etc. The lobby of this hotel is jaw-dropping gorgeous.There's a great pizza place on 55 W. 45th St. called Little Italy pizza parlor. Delicious!!Also a very good Irish Pub down the street.Like most New York hotels-- the room is small, but even the Superior rooms are very small at the Roosevelt and the bathrooms are uncomfortably cramped and in need of a renovation. Despite the many elevators, they are slow and cramped full. If you're on the 6th or 7th floor, be prepared to wait awhile...as there are about 19 floors in this hotel. Food from Room service is not good and they will not call you if something is not available, they just substitute something else. I'm not a picky eater, and it was not a good meal especially for the price.Perhaps the most disappointing thing about the Roosevelt Hotel is the staff. The room size and condition can be forgiven, but not the overall attitude of the people working there. There are many people who just can't be pleased and I'm sure it's not easy for staff to deal with that day in and day out. However, I believe most people like myself, just appreciate a friendly greeting and people who actually take pride in their job and place of work. You don't see this at the Roosevelt. Even the people working the breakfast buffet...although efficient, they never smiled and seemed miserable.Front desk service is slow as molasses and not organized. Bell hops are too busy chatting amongst themselves to help you unless you're dressed in a fur and will tip well. Maids hover and rush you...asking when you are checking out.Just read some of the reviews below...and these comments are just from January alone.....&quot;Cranky door man, staff not very friendly, Worst Customer service EVER!, staff not very helpful and always in a bad mood.&quot;Whoever runs the show at the Roosevelt should thank their lucky stars for their location, because that is one of the few things the hotel has going for it."
209,1961,Jan 26 2009 	Ask yourself what you want in a NYC hotel and this place ticks every box.	I just got back from 6 nights and I am so glad I booked it and didn't listen to the negative reviews on here. Ask yourself what you want from a NYC hotel and the Roosevelt ticks all the boxes. 1] Location: you don't need to use the subway. This place is within walking distance of all the major attractions. 2] Safety: It is located within a busy area at the heart of NY so no matter the time you always feel safe.3] Room size: The rooms are fair for NY where everything is generally small. If you will use it as a crash pad it will suit your needs completely.4] Staff: Generally pleasant. Others have complained about the cleaning staff but I found them to be outstanding. You also never get pressured to leave the room. If you have a don't disturb sign and leave your room late make sure you put the please clean my room sign when you leave. How else are the staff to know you have gone?5] Tipping: I never felt pressured into giving tips. Staff asked if you required assistance and obviously you tip if you get help. But if you don't want help simply say no.
210,1961,"Jan 26 2009 	Convenient location	First the demerits of the hotel : Room cleanup was abit late daily though, once I waited til 3pm and my room wasn't cleaned up yet. Room was pretty small (lacking in space to comfortably open up my luggage) Work table was also too small for anything more than a tiny laptop, I had to use the laptop from the bed most of the time &amp; eating in the room was tedious. Now for the merits (which greatly overwhelms the demerits in my opinion)The hotel was in a great location; I could walk almost everywhere from it - to the Empire State Building, Fifth Ave Shopping, Broadway. Subway was very very near as well (just behind the hotel) when I decided to head to Guggenheim / Tokyo Met museum. there's a korean supermarket/eatery which opens til late very near it if you need any late snacks / pizza (pizza was great), and generally lively area which was safe to walk around alone in the day/night."
211,1961,"Jan 25 2009 	Decent Midtown Hotel	The Roosevelt Hotel is great if you are looking for a decently priced hotel in midtown Manhattan. The best feature about this hotel is obviously it's location on 45th Street @ Madison Ave, which is a stone's throw from Grand Central station making public transport a breeze. The hotel room itself was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the size of the room was decent for NYC. I only have to minor, negative comments. I feel as though the bathroom could use an update as it wasn't in perfect condition and clearly showed the age of the hotel. Also, there didn't seem to be many accessible electrical outlets, which made plugging in multiple devices difficult (particularly with two people staying in the room). Overall the hotel is a decent choice and a great location."
212,1961,"Jan 25 2009 	Not a bad place	We stayed here for 5 nights. The location of the hotel is perfect. The whole impression was average: the hall, lifts and rooms need refreshment. The room was rather small but clean and cosy. The bed was comfortable (a little bit soft for me). The condition worked not very well (too loudly). Our window looked on hotels ventilation system and that was unpleasant and also noisy even when the window was cloused."
213,1961,"Jan 23 2009 	Great hotel and location	Excellent hotel, great location. old and classy reception. The room we stayed in were a bit worn out, however the hotel made up with plenty of old charm."
214,1961,Jan 23 2009 	Great location!	We stayed here for 3 nights and would say ignore bad reviews.I am fussy but found hotel 2 be clean and all staff helpful.We did not eat at hotel as prices were steep!Just across the road is a gr8 deli where we had breakfast every day.Would def stay again.
215,1961,"Jan 18 2009 	A Great Find	I have stayed at the Roosevelt three times. Each time, I found it to be a good, affordable option when visiting New York. The Roosevelt is not a high-end luxury hotel. Nor is it a typical chain hotel. But, the rooms are clean and generally well-kept. For touring Manhattan, the location is great. It is a short walk to a number of sites and is close to Grand Central Station for public transportation."
216,1961,"Jan 16 2009 	Great outside poor inside	Great position, in the heart of midtown Manhattan, in front of Grand Central Station.Great hall and nice gym.Really really small and old room, bathroom awful. Considering that I payed about 220$ per room per night.Be aware that you will be asked to tip to:1) take your luggage from the street to the elevator2) take your luggage from the elevator to the room3) take your luggage inside the deposit4) take your luggage outside of the depositThis is way too much for me."
217,1961,"Jan 15 2009 	unsatisfactory service	We were really excited to go to the roosevelt for the night, we only stayed one night, we being me and my boyfriend. Upon arriving there we had to queue for 20 minutes in order to check in. This alone would have been okay but upon finally checking in at around 7pm we were told are room was still not ready. With little choice in the matter we left our bags with the concierge and went for dinner and a walk we came back an hour and a half later. There was only one other couple in the queue in front of us yet we were stood there for 30 minutes this time and slowly the queue built up behind us, meanwhile they have only 2 people on reception only one of whom is dealing with check ins. What made it worse was some people just walked up passed the queue and the staff on reception served them before all the people who had been waiting there. Anyway we finally checked in and found are room and just wanted to have a bath. Loan behold the bath plug was not airtight so after waiting 10 minutes for the water to get hot we ran our bath only to find shortly after all the water to be draining out. Naturally we called reception and were told after our evening of waiting we would have to wait 30-45 minutes for someone to come fix our bath. The man came and went to fix our bath and we proceeded to run one again only to find the man had not fixed the problem anyway we called again and after another 15 minutes we had our bath fixed. Unfortunately at this point we were both too exhausted to enjoy it. Overall it seems the roosevelt needs to be more efficient and reduce waiting time as it is the last thing people want to face after travelling."
218,1961,"Jan 15 2009 	Wouldnt stay here again...	My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights over Christmas. We had booked directly through the hotels website. Luckily I had printed out the confirmation as when we went to check in, the lady at reception said the booking they had for us wasnt for another two days. I showed her the booking confirmation and after about 5 minutes of silence from her and no apology, she gave us a keys for a room. The room was tiny but seemed clean, the bathroom was also small but was clean. There was A LOT of dust on the curtains, I dont think they had ever been cleaned. The air conditioner didnt really work properly.Room service food was overpriced. We only ate there once as it was so expensive. All in all, the hotel was in a great location but we wouldnt recommend it and would never stay here again. The room was way too small and the staff were never really friendly."
219,1961,"Jan 13 2009	The Rooseveldt Hotel in NYC	Despite the bad reviews it got recently I and my 17 year old daughter stayed there for a few days just before Xmas 2008. - we quite liked it and I hardly tipped anyone except at the bar etc.- nor was asked to do so! As for it being a bit run-down, after all it is a very old establishment.A few weeks earlier I had stayed with my two sons at the neighbouring Hyatt - newer, more elegant but not not really very different! And the bathtub drain was clogged!~AWJR"
