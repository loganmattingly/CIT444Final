279,1991,"Oct 17 2006 	A wonderful hip but complicated hotel	Overall, the Hotel stay was great. I took my significant other there for his birthday during the labor day weekend.The lounge and bar area is so cool, and the music playing all around just makes you feel great.The room size was average and the decor in the room was cool, but simple. The views are minimal due to the location and other high rises nearby, so don't stay here for the views.The Blue Fin restaurant is excellent, and the breakfast is especially good there. Service is also great.Unfortunately our Hotel room wasn't ready to check in until 5pm, and we arrived there at 2:30pm, but other than that all went well. They were booked solid the night before and simply couldn't get our room ready in time. Understandable for this busy part of town. It was a bit of an inconvenience, but we stored our bags and went shopping downtown to pass the time, and then were called when the room was ready.The elevators in the hotel are not well designed. You need to take two separate elevators to get from outside the hotel to your room, and finding your elevator is not easy. I don't know why they designed it this way, it was a mistake. They should try to fix this if they can.Valet parking was good, as were the other services.Overall a great place to stay if you want to be in the middle of everything. It is by no means quiet, but it's Times Square."
280,1991,Oct 15 2006	Great Palce to stay	I loved staying at the W time square it was clean close to all the action and I really enjoyed the staff and the bar and resturant. I was did not like was the spa! a bit under kept and the services was not up to par. otherwise Great!!!
281,1991,Oct 10 2006 	Fun in NYC	This was a GREAT property. We stayed on the 57th floor with an amazing view of Times Square. We traveled with 2 different families and the adults and kids loved it equally!!! It is rather dark in the hallways and lobby but it is supposed to be that way. The beds were very comfortable and the location was great to take in a show or wander the hustle and bustle of Times Square. My only complaint was the noise on Saturday night. The traffic and city life was extremely loud even though we were on the top floor. I had to wear ear plugs to get a good nights sleep. Sunday night was very quiet and the ear plugs went in the trash. We had a great time.
282,1991,"Oct 6 2006 	Ultra Hip Hotel with a Lot of Action	The W at Times Square was wonderful!!! If you like to be in the middle of it all, this is the place to stay, but still doesn't have a &quot;touristy&quot; feel. The rooms were ultra hip with flat screen TV's and modern furnishings. The rooms are high enough from the ground that you will have no problem sleeping. Be sure to check out the Living Room at nights after 10 PM. This is the place to be! Keep your eyes open because we saw and met our share of celbs! If you are into the dancing scene, hit the club in the basement of the hotel - be prepared though the bathroom here is unisex! WONDERFUL Hotel!"
283,1991,"Oct 3 2006 	Can't Complain	My Fiance and I stayed at the W Hotel in Time Square from September 22-24, 2006. I have to say that I rather enjoyed my stay. The hotel is very well located in the heart of Time Square. We walked back from Central Park and it took us about a half an hour.The bar at the hotel is very modern and nice. The staff was rather pleasant as well. The rooms were typical W rooms. Very new &amp; modern, although these are a little older than I am used to for a W. Overall I would say that it is a very nice hotel if you are looking to spend some time in the center of Manhatten. Beware though as like much of New York, it is expensive."
284,1991,"Sep 4 2006 	great location rooms a bit small	Great Location if you're a tourist - you can walk to many of the area attractions. The subway is also fairly nearby opening up the rest of the city for excursions.Bar area was spacious and very hip with nice decor.Hotel security was definitely present in the lobby area checking to make sure only guests entered to the elevator area.Everything else was a bit small - not surprisingly but clean.Rooms were, again, a bit small but the beds were comfortable with nice robes. Good water pressure from the shower although lighting was a bit lacking. Rooms were clean and noise level was low (was at the end of the hall).Elevators were small and could get a bit cramped if you have a lot luggage... although we rarely had to share.Parking - be prepared to pay $50/night for valet parking. Street parking can be hard to obtain.The surrounding area had restaurants from a deli to higher end restaurants depending on your budget. The lighting in the streets were adequate and comfortable to walk around at night."
285,1991,"Aug 22 2006 	Fabulous Modern Hotel	My husband and I had the time of our life in New York City and staying at the W was a highlight. The energy of the lobby bar (which we only walked past) and decor of the entire hotel was modern, well thought out, and very aesthetically pleasing and stimulating to your senses. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Julia was fabulous as were the guys on the 3rd shift doorman staff. They kept us entertained with friendly conversation as we waited 1 hour for our 4:30 AM car service which arrived at 5:30 AM. New Yorkers really are the best! We loved the bed, Bliss products, location, activity, staff, and again, did I mention the ultra hip modern decor throughout the hotel? Oh, and the cookies served in the afternoon were very good. The tour buses leave from across the street and Broadway shows are right around the corner, location-location-location!!!! Please ignore the bad reviews unless you are known to have really bad, drab taste. We will be back soon!"
286,1991,"Aug 10 2006 	WOW W!	Our first trip to New York. Me, Hubby and Baby (18 months) Uncle and Grandparents too - We Loved it! Yes its Uber trendy, however, fitted us well. My daughter asked me why the TV was on all the time - it was the view over Times Square and Broadway that she was looking at. Now at 3 she stills remembers it! Well placed for visiting all we needed to and the concierge and Door personnel were fantastic - understated but seriously clued up.The aspect of the W outweighed any 'minor' imperfections for us.A great time had by all - really pleased we got to stay at W for our first venture into NYC!Oh - and yes, Sage and Lemongrass products from Bliss have become favourites, we were impressed by the toiletries too!"
287,1991,"Aug 9 2006 	Great Location	I recently stayed at the W Times Square with my mother and brother on a weekend trip to NYC. I typically make it to the city once each year with my husband and have historically stayed at hotels in the financial district. I was a little worried when my Priceline purchase resulted in this hotel based on the reviews at the time. We arrived after midnight Friday evening and were met at the curb by the courteous valet staff. We were in our room in a matter of minutes and were pleasantly surprised by our 16th floor corner room with a great view overlooking times square. It was clean comfortable and roomy by NY standards.Throughout our stay, the hotel service was exceptional. Checkout was very convenient too. Make sure to request your car about 30 minutes before you plan to leave.I almost want to thank the folks who left the poor reviews as the hotel blew my expectations away. Nice job, W!A few quick NYC recommendations:- Caliente Cab in Greenwich Village for great margaritas- Jekyl &amp; Hyde for an entertaining meal with children in the village- Hairspray the musical for a fun loving crowd w/o young children (It's hilarious but a little mature at times)"
288,1991,Aug 9 2006 	Ok but not the best	We stayed here over the 4th of July weekend. The hotel is in a great location - right in Times Square and close to transportation. The hotel was ok. I've stayed at better ones in NYC. It was very dark and dreary. We didn't have any problems with noise or our room. We just thought is was a bit stuffy for a W hotel. Stay at the Westin a few blocks away - it's much nicer.
289,1991,"Aug 1 2006 	Very pleasant surprise!!	We stayed at the W in Times Square for a long weekend and we were pleasantly surprised considering some of the reviews that I read here were not so good. The staff at check-in was very friendly. We checked our luggage and the front desk took my cell phone to call us when our room was ready. We walked around the corner and were about ready to order lunch when they called! We ate lunch and then went and checked in! It is always nice to get settled in as soon as you arrive. We were given a great corner room with a large window looking out on Times Square and another window facing south with a slight view of the Hudson river. Our room was on the 30th floor. Nice clean room with robes and bliss bath products were great. Before we left for the evening, I called the front desk to let them know that our sink was not draining. When we returned to the room, there was a note from maintenance that it was fixed. We never had another problem with it. The beds are extremely comfortable!! We were not disturbed by traffic noise or outside lights. I asked for a late check out because we didn't leave for the airport until 4:00 pm and it was sweltering outside. We wanted to have a place to go rest and cool off. Instead of checking out at 12:00, we were allowed to keep our room until 2:00 which I was really grateful for!! The concierge was able to print out our boarding passes for us too. If you want to stay right in the heart of Times Square then this is the place for you!We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel to others!"
290,1991,"Jul 31 2006 	great hotel!	My family just returned from a 3 night stay at the W Times Square. We booked on hotwire, but were treated like we paid top dollar for this stay! Staff was overly friendly and helpful. We arrived at 11:00am and were given a room without having to wait. My children, ages 10 and 12, loved the room, especially the plasma screen TV. Beds were very comfortable and the room was not too small as I have read in several other reviews. Would definitely stay again! ( And no problem with a request for two beds.)"
291,1991,"Jul 29 2006	W Times Sq. in the middle of it all	I stayed at the W Times Square for the first time July 21-23. As a frequent visitor to New York and a loyal Starwood member, I felt this hotel and location were excellent.The highlights: - If you like the whole W &quot;vibe,&quot; this place will be right up your alley. The street entrance is a trippy, artsy light and water scene that sets the mood. Elevators take you up to the 7th floor &quot;living room,&quot; which is dimly lit and comfortable with fun couches, light projections and a nearby bar. Check in was quick and friendly. - Rooms decorated very modern, flat screen TV, full mini-bar, desk facing the window, overlooking Times Square, extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Shower was all glass - no tub - and quite roomy. Not great water pressure....but hey, you can't have everything. Bliss bath products were a nice treat. - Location is perfect if you're seeing a show (all theaters are within a few blocks - easy to walk anywhere), catching the subway (stations for Blue Line from JFK @ 50th &amp; 8th.....or all lines a few blocks down the street @ 42nd St.), or just walking uptown or downtown. Very centrally located. Big plus for me was Starbucks only steps away from the front door!Really had no complaints about this hotel. Best rates can be found at spg.com...search AAA (if you're a member - they asked to see my AAA card at this hotel) or promotional rates. Standard rates are very pricey, even for New York.The only caveat is for those not familiar with the W. This chain is targeted to a hipper crowd. This ain't no Marriott with a floral bedspread, plastic shower curtain and a coffee shop. Furnishings and bathrooms are very modern (the bathroom door was frosted glass and slid closed on a track) and hallways are moody and pretty dark.Also, since you're in Times Square, there's bound to be honking horns from gridlocked traffic in the streets below and LOTS of flashing lights from billboards coming in through windows if shades aren't drawn - I love the sights and sounds of the city, but some may not appreciate that.If you get a decent rate, splurge for the W Times Square!"
292,1991,"Jul 27 2006	W all the Way	My boyfriend and I stayed here July 22nd and 23rd. We had a great time. The guestrooms were clean and the aroma of the room was just wonderful. From the time we arrived to the time of departure, the hotel staff was very friendly and professional. The Blue Fin was a great place to eat. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner there and everything was fabulous. The Bliss products are absolutely awesome. My only complaint would be the location of the elevators. We stayed on the 51st floor and were a little confused by the elevator setup. Not a major deal but whatchagonnado. This was the first time we ever stayed at a W hotel and we will gladly stay again ~ Wherever, Whenever, Whatever"
293,1991,"Jul 24 2006 	Honest Reivew	My boyfriend surprised me with a weekend trip to NYC for my 26th b-day. This was our first trip to NYC but we have traveled to many other large cities in the US. I have to admit that I was a little nervous about the hotel after reading what many others wrote about it on this site. We arrived at the W around noon on Friday and the check in was fast and friendly. We had a room on the 40th floor with a view of Times Square. Our room was clean, and more spacious than I expected. We loved the bed and the robes! The Bliss products also were a nice touch. He had arranged to have a birthday surprise waiting for me that night which consisted of rose petals leading to the bed and then a big heart of petals on the bed. Also, there were chocolate covered strawberries and champagne waiting for us with a nice card. (This was complimentary). This is an example of how they go out of their way to make your stay special. Also the next night a bottle of wine was sent to our room. (also complimentary!) All the workers were friendly and very helpful. We both enjoyed our stay at the W. The location was great for us first timers to NYC. We didn't hear much from outside while in our room so I don't know what others complained about. There are areas that this hotel could improve upon (not the the service) but overall we really enjoyed it. I would definately recomend this hotel to friends. I would also suggest contacting the hotel to see if you can get a better rate than the internet, and if not, see what they can do for you to make your stay more special.For what we paid I feel we got a great deal!"
294,1991,"Jul 20 2006 	What an absolute dive	This hotel and the services it offered were so bad, it is hard to know where to start. The rooms were very small and the bathrooms minute. There were stains on the bedspreads and the carpets were very tired. The noise from Times Square was dreadful and could be heard on the 46th, 51st and 37th floors (we moved three times to try and find some peace and quiet).The rooms that have connecting doors to another room must be the worst. There is no sound insulation whatsoever and we had to call security at 4am to ask them to speak with our neighbours to turn the TV down.The hotel is under-staffed. Our luggage took a long time to arrive and on departure, they could not find where they had put our luggage (it had been in storage). The lobby (7th floor) was heaving with piles of luggage everywhere and noone was there to help.The only good thing about the hotel was the breakfast. Food was fresh and the service was reasonably prompt. Then again, for US$39 for two smoothies and two toasted bagels, it should be.An absolute dump. It should be closed down, given a thorough cleaning, hire more staff to look after guests, get double-glazing (at least) and get rid of connecting doors.New York has a tremedous choice of hotels, so avoid this one."
295,1991,"Jul 6 2006 	Second and last time at this joint	If you look closely this hotel is a haven for pretentious people who want to stay and play in Times Square. However, it doesn't take a trained eye to see the service, food and housekeeping is below moderate yet you can say you stayed at the W Times Square...BIG DEAL. New York City is full of truly quaint, exceptional hotels that cost the same and provide a much better level of service. It really seems that W is all about the bars and their stupid lifestyle stores-- they've really lost their way when it comes to accomodating business or leisure travelers -- so why give this hotel anymore of my money? You don't get much in return...not even a glass of water with your room service order...that needs to purchased separately from your minibar, folks. Ridiculous."
296,1991,"Jul 3 2006 	Value Yes Nice No	I was at the W Times Square for business. It is a great location for pleasure but it is very difficult to find a quiet spot or an outside cafe. My room was near the elevators and I constantly heard noise in the hallway and elevator music. I did not feel as if I had any privacy. My room was very worn with the most unacceptable issue being a stained bed skirt. I think without a renovation it is a three star at best. I paid $270 including tax, high floor and nice view, so I consider it a value. And last but certainly not least, the staff was wonderful and helpful."
297,1991,Jun 28 2006	different-but good different!	I was a little hesitant about staying at the W after reading some of the reviews on here but I really enjoyed my stay and wouldnt hesitate to stay again at the W!I do agree that while the rooms were overall pretty good-really comfortable beds etc there wasnt a very good attention to detail.The paint finishes were pretty bad and a few things were shabby but not anough to detract from the overall room-for me at least.The location was awesome if its your first time in new york but maybe a bit crazy if you have been a few times before.Its anything but peaceful.The bar in the bottom of the hotel I originally thought was a bit wierd.A lobby/bar is a strange concept but after going to the bar I realised it was actually pretty nice and convenient.The service was fantastic and very attentive.They even sent a follow up email after I returned home to ensure that we were happy with everything.The hotel did have a pretty strange/mod vibe about it with the black hallways ans blue lights which I thought was cool but im young-ish.Im not sure how much my parents would have liked it had they come along.The rooms were kind of small but not still comfortable.The blue fin sushi place downstairs was pretty unimpressive-with so many awesome places to eat in new york i wouldnt waste my time on that one.The double decker grayline bus tour left just half a block up from the hotel which was great-see all of new york in 2 hours and then decide where you want to go back and take a look at on your own or whatever.I would probably stay in a different area next time i visit new york-but if you like the hustle and bustle of times square then this is an awesome hotel.
298,1991,May 30 2006	Great location/ little value	Clearly you are paying for location- it is really really good. The hotel is too pricey for mini-box sized rooms. Make sure to get a room away from the elevators and make reservations for drinks. Multiple elevator changes makes it a long time to get to the room.
299,1991,May 26 2006	Very good overall	We got a really high floor and a very good view even though I booked it a few days before and it is the memorial day weekend. The boutique style hotel looks very sleek and the room look fantastic. It was very pricy and I do feel like there should be more they can offer. Wierdest is they don't have wireless internet. Shouldn't this be a standard to modern hotels? Everything else are very satisfying.
300,1991,"May 25 2006 	Cool and convenient	The W Times Square has a downtown feel with the convenience of being near the theater, shopping and many tourist destinations. It is consistent &quot;W&quot; fare, which means cool decor, swank lobby bar and great service. I recommend as your home base for a fun NYC trip."
301,1991,"May 23 2006 	Not the best place to stay for your precious $$$	One of the reviewers had a terrible experience. We didn't have it so bad but we did have our issues. The bathroom was not really clean, we felt quite uncomfortable we sprayed everything with lysol! the room was dark, no view to speak of, the bed was comfy with plush pillows but their were stains on the sheets &amp; the bed covers were kind of dusty, our room was by the elevator also, room svc was so slow, we also didn't get a nytimes each morning. at $380 per nite, &quot;what should we have expected from a 1st class NYC hotel?!&quot; Must admit the living room lounge was a kool place to hang out (JW blue was $40 a glass!). Staff were quite friendly, Jana our concierge quite helpful. Kate the bartender de-gorgeous! Those were the redeeming value of staying here in the heart of times square. If it wasn't for the staff from the concierge, bartender, doorman &amp; local beat cop recommending Raku down the block for sushi, it would have not been a very good stay at the W. But the sushi at Raku was excellent - so thks to the W-staff, one last saving grace. But I would not recommend staying here."
302,1991,"Apr 30 2006	Lots of Fun!	Many of the reviews of this hotel are true: 1) it is dimly lit both in the rooms and in the hallways; 2) the bathrooms are tiny; 3) some of the rooms are showing their age. BUT, the atmosphere is fun for couples looking to book a romantic weekend. You couldn't ask for a better location in Times Square. The lobby/lounge area on the 7th floor really comes alive after 10pm. And, the restaurant at ground level, The Blue Fin, is really excellent. We found the staff very service oriented (especially the concierge). Best of all is the trademark W beds - very plush - and the best part of a romantic weekend!"
303,1991,"Apr 9 2006	Relieved - it was a great hotel	After reading the views I too was wondering what we had let ourselves in for. Yes the place was very modern and dark. It is by not means a traditional hotel but we enjoyed it. Our room size was fine the bed was very comfy (maybe a little bit short for US standards) especially the pillows and since back home I shall buy one from their website (as I do miss it it was sooo comfy). We were on the 36th floor so not very high and had a view of another hotel but if you looked sideways you could see times square and on the other side the sea. We arrived in the early hours and in the room a light was on for us and also the cd was playing music.On arrival at the hotel you walk passed the concierge desk on the right with the restaurant on the left. It has the water running on the ceiling and looked very impressive. You take the lift to the 7th floor where the main reception desk is together with the lounge area and shop. You then take another lift to your room. We did not see the whisky club or the spa area as we were out sight seeing all day.The bliss collection they supplied to use in the bathroom were fantastic and you could buy them to take home from the hotel's shop which certainly did have some unusual items. I would have liked to have seen a few womans personal items in the bathroom but never mind. The sink and tap had seen better days but I feel that perhaps the quality of the make let them down unlike the shower which had a good well known company name and this worked wonderful and could copy with the constant use.The food in the hotel was good but very expensive. I did have one complaint as one morning after being seated in the restaurant we waited for 15 mins until I got up to ask for the menu. He said he would bring it over which he did. We then waited another 5 mins without being served and a woman came in and was seen to straight away. We then walked out and complained to the Manager. The concierge, Gilmar, was wonderful. He was so nice and helpful and told us everything we needed to know giving us leaflets with vouchers in for free gifts and money off items.I did find the lounge area to be a bit intimidating as in the evenings it was full of people and very noisy. However, one evening we went in there for a drink and found it fine.I would come to this hotel again if it was just my husband and I. I would not feel it is the right hotel to bring my daughter. While we were there (Mon-Sat) it was mainly business people. I feel it is a very business like hotel which showed in the bedrooms that had pc, printers, paper etc.Everyone there was very nice especially Gilmar and the location was very good."
304,1991,"Mar 27 2006	Far above the rest.......W surpasses!!!	Just got back from our weekend at the W times square. After reading all the reviews, I have to admit I was a little concerned about taking the trip to the W, but all my fears were dismissed as I arrived at this great hotel. To start, the location is great. It is smack dab on times square and broadway...just perfect. The lobby was very cool and somewhat trendy with dim lights and funky seating. The check in process was very quick. We arrived early and left our bags which was not a problem and were given the option of a call or text message when our room was ready. And like they said, when the room was ready we received the text message.The room was great, we asked for a view and had a great view of broadway and times square. It was a beautiful room, far bigger than what others had mentioned. Very funky bathroom with glass shower and sliding doors, loved it. Also the bed was amazing and mirrors covered much of the walls, with a huge flat screen in the middle. Overall, the hotel offered everything and more. I would highly recommend the W times square to anyone who wants the complete chic New York City experience!!!"
305,1991,"Mar 11 2006	Good compromise	I can't beleive that there are 100 better hotels in NYC. Some of the reviews are off the mark. If you are easily offended by some quite dull dance music in the lifts and black walls in the halls, then maybe you should stick to the dull multinational chains in the area. The customer service was great and the entrance, lobby and bar, were quite cool. We found the staff friendly and not at all snobby. Our room was not to the same standard but it had a great view. Some of the fittings in the room are ageing and some of the tiles in the shower (with a door in our case) were loose. Also the hotel bar does get busy, with lots of non-residents which was annoying. Overall a good choice for the area."
306,1991,"Mar 8 2006	Lovely - But is it worth the premium???	We stayed in this Hotel during Dec 2005. Although this is a good hotel in a fantastic location, we did have some reservations.We arrived at 9.30pm, after a 12 hour journey. Our first impression was a little disturbing, as the reception basically was like walking into a trendy nightclub, in full swing. Don't get me wrong we are only young, but this did feel intimidating whilst we just wanted to get to bed!We requested a non-smoking room - but ended up with the opposite. We were advised that the hotel was full, so there was no chance of changing (probably as we were on a discounted rate). Our room was beautiful and trendy, however it was very dark, as there were only wall lights - useless for make up application. We overlooked this as our view was fabulous - full window overlooking Time Square.Our bathroom was poor (bath didn't hold water properly) and there were signs of neglect (i.e. cracked tiles). If we had paid the full rate we would have been gutted, as I have stayed in far better 4* Hotels.The location was perfect for us to explore New York, so the Hotel did not spoil our fun. To be honest we would have probably been ok with a 2-3*, as we spent most of our time out and about.Tip - make sure that you visit customer services in Bloomingdales / Macys to get a discount card, if you are out of state."
307,1991,"Mar 8 2006	Happy Experience at the W Hotel Times Square	I stayed at the W from a Fri-Tues and every bit of the experience was wonderful. From the extra helpful doormen/bellstaff to the fun and friendly front desk personnel, the service and quality is excellent! I will try to stay there again on my next trip to NYC."
308,1991,Mar 6 2006	Great place!!	Our stay at the W Time Square was wonderful! We are four women ages range from 27-45. We all loved it!. The staff knows how to treat each and everyone of their customers like VIP's. I couldn't get over how attentive they were to our needs. We were on the 19th floor and were very happy with our room. Hotel is very close to Brooks Atkinson Theatre. Club Whiskey was great...talk to James and get into the vip section where dancing is lots of fun! I am a hotel snob and have stay frequently at Bellagio and Venetian in Las Vegas as well as Paris and Cannes Chic hotels. This is a FUN hotel! I am already planning my next trip...starbucks is directly across the street.
309,1991,"Feb 21 2006	Good and Bad.......	Im not going to create a long winded review but i'll touch on some important issues with my stay on 2/19/06. First - the guest rooms are very small - as is typical in NYC - they are decorated in dark gray colors and the furnishings have a very cheap - IKEA feel. My sheets and duvet cover had rips/holes in them. Blue Fin was a great place to eat with very good food - athmosphere was great - modern with excellent lighting. Late in the evening we went to the club downstairs - THE WHISKEY. We had been there earlier at around 5pm just to go in and check it out. As soon as we walked down the stairs there was an overwhelming smell of TOILET BOWL in the place. It smelled like the bathroom at the port authority - it was bad - we were going to have a drink but we told the bartender about it and just let - it was BAD. Later that night we returned, curious to check it out and see if they did something about the doo-doo smell - and they did - it was fine. BUT ....Let me just tell you that the crowd was HORRIBLE - i couldnt believe the quality of people in this place - it was like all the misfits who couldnt get beyond the ropes at the better clubs. Maybe it was a slow night and the bouncers at the door by the street were ushering in whomever they could find walking by with a &quot;no cover charge&quot; deal just to fill the place up- i dont know - but when we got there were had just come from eating dinner at SPICE MARKET - (great place by the way - very chic and trendy) and were at the club across the street &quot;ONE&quot; (another great place) - no one at the whiskey was dressed well by NYC club standards - there were a lot of un-cool - very un-hip chubbies on the floor - one woman was wearing nike sneakers with MOM JEANS - ....there were some thuggish looking guys dancing with their coats and hats still on. Its was so bizarre....it was like watching a bunch of townies from oklahoma out for a big night in &quot;the big city&quot; - all excited to finally be at a GEN-U-WINE CLUHHBBB! - HORRIBLE AND NOT COOL! i swear i wish i took pics to post in this review - wouldve been funny to show these people....if you ever go there, watch out for the ass smell - lol! dont say i didnt warn you!"
310,1991,"Feb 10 2006	If you only read one review on this hotel....	Giselle Bavaro. That is the only name you need to know if you're thinking of having a function and staying at the W Times square. Giselle is the area manager for the W and my wife and I recently had our wedding there. We planned it for a year from the other side of the world and Giselle made it run like clock work. All the hotel staff from the doormen, the conceirge, check in, wedding staff...the nicest hotel staff I have ever come across.Forget these reviews about 'dark hallways' and 'disappointing rooms'. The hotel is in the centre of the universe and what a vibe. Get a suite and I promise you won't be disappointed.I cannot thank the W and Giselle enough for making the weekend stay as memorable as it was. It's 2 months later and they're still sending us gifts overseas! Their service extends beyond what you'd expect and that's what makes the W experience one of the best.Stay at this hotel."
311,1991,"Feb 3 2006 	Great stay!	I always stay at St-Regis or W's whenever possible, and after reading some of the reviews in here I was a little concerned before I left for a 5 day business trip on which I brought my family with me (kids are 7 and 5). Our experience was great in every way. This hotel is trendy, very hip - if that's not for you don't come here. But I absolutely loved it and the kids were treated extremely well by the staff. We did have a little issue with our first suite, and they didn't even bother trying to fix it - they just upgraded us in a matter of a few hours. The hotel manager actually came to talk to us directly to apologize... he didn't need to because we understood the situation but it was a nice touch. We have already booked our next 11 days trip to NYC at this hotel in March... I would actually live here if I could :-)"
312,1991,Jan 24 2006	Loved it	Just got back and this hotel is an A+- classy excellent service and central location.
313,1991,"Jan 5 2006 	W = Waste of time	Have been a fan of other W Hotels. The one in Time Square is a bit cheap and disappointing. When booking would have been nice if they notified us of the planned construction that was going to start on our first day. Massage in spa was excellent... only couldn't really relax do to the hammer and chiseling 3 floors below.... not their fault. BUT the rooms very small, not impressive. The heat you turn it up a bit you boil... down a bit.... you freeze. The shower tiles were broken so after every shower you have a flood in the bathroom. Decor in rooms very dated... seemed they tried too hard, but then again so does half of NY, so once again can't fault them. One last thing, the music they play in the hallways day and night to creat atmosphere I guess... you can hear it in your rooms when you are trying to sleep. If I had to recommend a W in NY it would definitely be the one on Lex."
314,1991,"Jan 2 2006	hip w	We stayed at the w times square dec 3. I used starwood points so the room was free. This was a very busy weekend in ny. Our room wasnt ready when we arrived about 4 pm, but we checked our bags, given free drink vouchers, and they called us on our cellphone when the room was ready. They had a nice warm beverage and cookies in the lobby. Everything about this hotel was very hip. I suppose you would either like or hate the decor, but we liked it. The room was nice, quiet , good shower and the usual great starwood beds. Service was good,informal. We dined at the Blue fin attached to the hotel and the food was very good(wine is pricey however) A .very good stay"
315,1991,"Dec 31 2005	W disappoints	We picked the W for a romantic weekend getaway. Our past W experiences have been great. This one has location, a fun entry, a neat lobby and bar. When we got to our room it was a let down. I am sure it once was a nice room but honest to GOD I think our room was used by a local fraternity for 6 months. The walls were banged up and the sink was cracked. The TV center / bureau draws were not the same style as the room. Maybe the original that went with the room was broken in a brawl. We changed rooms and found the faternity used multiple rooms. There must be better for the price in NYC."
316,1991,"Dec 13 2005 	my favorite place to stay in NYC	OK, as mentioned it's got the great location, it's definitely hip and the bar is a great hang out space.Did I mention the (female)bar staff is gorgeous? Check in is very quick and efficient....I always ask for a corner room, which has a great view of Times Square and is very quiet as well.I like the decor...it is very modern and &quot;cool&quot;...you feel like you're staying a contemporary NYC apartment.The bed is very comfortable, the rooms are always quiet (well insulated for sound....important to me), the elevators are quick, there is a CD player and DVD player in the rooms, mini bar......hey it works for me!"
317,1991,"Dec 4 2005 	Seriously good (and oh so hip)	If black is the new 'in' color then this hotel has to be the center of everything cool. From the valets who look like they've just finished a shift at the hottest night club in town, to the rooms that are fashionably designed and funky, this hotel is now at the top of my list. Of course it didn't hurt that my company was paying the $500 a night bill (ouch), but there is no denying that this place personifies funk and cool. If you're in New York and you want to stay at a hotel that's right in the heart of it all (at Times Square) treat yourself to a special night or two and stay here."
318,1991,Dec 4 2005	W = Wonderful !!	We have recently returned from NYC and we stayed the W Hotel. This hotel is right in Times Square and was a fantastic location to get around all of the sites. This hotel is ultra contemporary and is very clean and the rooms were of a very high standard. We emailed prior to arrival to request a Times Square View (we did not pay for this) and upon arrival this was granted. The staff are highly professional and polite. We cannot recommend this hotel enough.
319,1991,"Nov 29 2005	Great view of parade	We stayed at the &quot;W&quot; during Thanksgiving and were overall pleased. There were some exceptions, however. The shared experience of the W might be too much of a shared experience when it comes to bathroom activity; the bathroom's partitions are constructed of something resembling rice paper. There is no exhaust fan which can be handy at times. The second issue I had with the &quot;W&quot; was when I requested they remove the mini-bar contents. The mini-bar is on the lower open shelf of the dresser in full view and much beyond the temptation of my 14 month old son. I was informed they would charge $35 for the accomodation. Since we were already paying right at $600 per night this &quot;convenience charge&quot; seemed excessive. The room was small, the halls very dark and the bath towels similar to those you might find at a Motel 6. The view, however, was fabulous and we were right in the middle of the action."
320,1991,"Nov 27 2005	Great beds great location poor receptionists!	Just returned from a four night stay at the W Hotel in Times square on a first trip to New York. I was a bit concerned having read previous reviews (after I'd booked) and true enough, the corridors were dark, the lounge music loud, and the smell from the scented candles a bit overpowering. I had asked for a corner room but this was not honoured. Our room was on 51st floor where we looked directly across into the Marriott where the rooms looked a bit more spacious.On the plus side, the location was fab and we were able to enjoy the thanksgiving day parade at close quarters. The bed was extremely comfortable, which I was very grateful for after a hard days sightseeing, and the bathroom products were first class. However I did feel that the hotel is badly let down by the desk staff who gave the impression of being too cool to deal with customers. I had to ask three times before one lady fully explained where the concierge was, why couldn't she do it first time without making me feel stupid (even if I am)? I've never seen a concierge sit in a black suit at a table with a laptop before, I thought he was a business man. The Concierge was extremely helpful though, and the maid who serviced the room was great as well.Given the excellent customer service I experienced everywhere else in New York, its a pity these desk clerks were the exception to the rule.I don't imagine I would return to this hotel as I'm sure there are plenty that are equally nice but a lot more welcoming."
321,1991,"Nov 26 2005	NICE BUT KIND OF DIRTY	Nov/2006 NOT 2005 - Site won't let me select 2006. Urine smell in bathroom, bathroom not cleaned well - yellow line across shower curtain which they exchanged after complaining. Maids not doing their jobs cleaning batroom. Bed was excellent and the rest of the room was fine. Would stay there again, but bring my own LYSOL!! Good location."
322,1991,"Nov 25 2005	 W Stands for Wonderful!	The W in the W New York Times Square stands for one thing, WONDERFUL! Originally booked in an Urban Suite, but we were upgraded to the Extreme Wow Suite the Ws version of the presidential suite. The suite included an ultra-chic living room with flat screen TVs a dining set, wet bar, cow skin rug, suede and leather couches, as well as two bedrooms. The master bedroom featured one king bed, a computer, shower with four shower heads and a plasma tv in both the bedroom and bathroom. There was also a very sexy private bar area in the corridor between the bathroom and bedroom. The other bedroom included two queen beds and a standard bedroom. The four closets in the room put together probably equaled the size of a standard NYC apartment. We also had a panoramic view of Times Square, Central Park, and the Northern Section Of New York. It was exciting knowing that celebrities liked Heidi Klum and Seal slept in the same bed as us among others. The hotel is amazing!! The service was ten times better then the Mandarin Oriental at more then half the price. The experience is TRUE new york and nothing less. I suggest dining at Blue Fin the meals are to die for!!! I do not however suggest ordering Sex in The Sheets from room service it was a big disappointment. The W New York by far exceeded our expectations, and I disagree with the other reviewers. The W New York Times Square is A MUST!!!!!"
323,1991,Nov 21 2005	Agree with the bad reviews	10 minutes on the phone for US$125 which I didn't find out until leaving when my total phone bill was $800.....this used to happen a decade ago....not now with the most competitive phone rates....kept charging me for crap breakfast service even though they promised it would be free !!! dark &amp; dirty is how I would describe it no matter what the view is like !!! I will not stay in any W or Westin Hotel again and I think Starwood Hotels (HOT is the equity ticker) is a BIG SELL.....
324,1991,Nov 14 2005	Yuck!	What a disappointment! The rooms were small and in bad condition. There was a big stain on the wall. Mirror was broken. The chic was all cheap. There was almost no service. The lobby/lounge on the seventh floor was just plain obnoxious. I feel so ripped off.
325,1991,"Nov 10 2005	Take a torch	OK, the corridors are not quite that dark but the black paint and dark carpets that seem to be the signature of the modern designer hotel are strongly in evidence here.We stayed two nights having had to relocate from a nearby hotel because they were full when we decided to extend our stay. The room was clean and very pleasant. Well equipped with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was a shower room. The shower was excellent although it partially flooded the rest of the bathroom.Oddly the walls of the bathroom were made of translucent plastic - a triumph of style over substance - and of possible concern to the more prudish.The bar was excellent and popular - a bit like the Sanderson to those who know that London hotel - and the staff civil at least. The hotel could not be more centrally located but I think the hotel is still quite expensive for what it is though and while you could be assured of a perfectly pleasant - indeed enjoyable - stay here unless I got a very good rate in the future I could not say it was good value or that I would hasten back."
326,1991,Nov 7 2005	Disappointing	We just returned from a weekend trip at the W Times Square and it was disappointing. The room resembled something designed by Trading Spaces...trying and failing to be chic. The staff appeared to be overworked and under trained. We frequently visit upscale trendy new venues and this just missed the mark. Keep looking!
327,1991,"Oct 19 2005	Central Modern But Maybe Too Cool??	The location of this hotel is excellent and it's within walking distance of most major attractions (Empire State, Macys, 5th Ave, Central Park etc.)It's also opposite the stop for the Grey Line downtown bus tour and beside the ticket booth for Broadway. So all in all it's great in that respect. As for the hotel itself it did have a lot of positive points such as a cool waterfall lobby and a funky reception/bar which had a great atmosphere. The rooms were nice and not too small. We were on the 30th floor so the noise wasn't too bad and the view was great of Times Square. Another plus was a great shower with lovely dimmed lights and Bliss bath products. The bed was very comfy as well and the munchie box was a nice touch. Now to the negatives... A few basics were left out of the room, e.g. an eye mask to block out the lights and ear plugs for the noise (wasn't much but it bothered me). Plus no comment card told me they don't care what we think. The staff were ok but mostly I thought a bit stand offish. It's like they are trying too hard to be cool and end up being rude. There were some exceptions but in general I found them difficult to deal with. Of special metion were the bar staff who genuinely were rude to a few people and who seemed to do no work at all except chatting among themselves. The rooms and corridors could also do with a repaint just because it's black and that can show up flaws easily in the daylight. On another positive note though we received complementary champagne for our anniversary and the complementary umberellas at reception were a nice touch, as was the free entry to the $20 nightclub below the hotel. All in all I'd say great for 20/30 somethings who like a modern style but not for those who like a classic look. Four out of five in my book for a 4* hotel."
328,1991,Oct 13 2005 	Simply Bad	I had the worst experience at the W Times Square. I wouldnt know where to start complaining o I better leave that. In NY you have plenty of hotels - but dont book this one.Marvin
329,1991,"Oct 10 2005	over-rated	I stayed here with 3 other girlfriends out on a girls only trip. The first problem we ran into was that they had &quot;misplaced&quot; one of our reservations for a room with 2 beds so that 2 of us had to stay in a room with a single king sized bed. They wouldn't even compensate us for the trouble. The hotel decor was very modern and reminded me a bit of that commercial where the older couple is in a very chic and modern hotel and they couldn't figure out how to work the shower. It wasn't that bad but you get the idea. We ordered room service one night and when we finished we put the table out in the corridor because it was bulky and took up a lot of space in the room. In the morning it was still there! The lounge was packed every night on the weekend with all sorts of trendy looking young people. I admit I'm just not into the trendy scene but it seemed like the sort of place where you go just to be seen so if you're into that sort of thing this is the place for you. I would have preferred something quieter and a little more grounded. But that's just me. The thing I liked the most about this hotel is that it's right in the heart of Time Square which was fun on weekend nights and we didn't have too much trouble with traffic noise in the morning. Oh, and the pillows were wonderful!"
330,1991,"Oct 8 2005 	Tried to rip me off	checked in ,wih a confirmed room and confirmed corpoate rate- but the hotel was overbooked, so they tried to jack the rate ....be careful, check you bill !rooms are dark and in need of maintenance."
331,1991,"Sep 13 2005	Steps Away from the Center of the Universe...	Recommended for: couples, singles, groups of friends, 20 to 30 somethings, business travelers looking to go out at night, fashion-conscious individuals, fans of W Hotels in generalNot recommended for: 50 and up (I would not recommend this hotel for my parents, in their early 70s), tourists, families (unless you have a fashion-conscious teenage daughter)What's good: sleek, modern entrance and lobby, 2 complimentary drinks at their bar, spacious rooms complete with very long vanity mirror, comfortable bed, large bathroom with complimentary Bliss bathroom products, large shower stall, excellent views of Times Square, chic Blue Fin restaurant, GREAT location in the heart of Times SquareWhat's bad: yes, you do need to put extra towels on the floor as the shower water does leak out; dark hallways? (that's too, picky, IMO--how much time does one actually spend in the hallway anyway?)Looking forward to going back and also trying another W hotel..."
332,1991,"Sep 9 2005 	Dark. Noisy. Just plain weird.	Stepping into the W hotel is like stepping into a &quot;Men in Black&quot; movie. If you enjoy either &quot;color&quot; or &quot;light&quot; you better run for the hills. This place is dark, dreary and just plain weird. Hallways are painted black, ultra modern decor, everything is either black, silver or chrome and the music ...let's just say that we payed for a hotel, not a rave dance party. The entire motifis techno-rave with neon lights attempting to brighten the black hallways and dreary surroundings. I felt like I was in a dark cave the entire time. The positive things this hotel has going for it is the location, the awesome turbo shower, a comfy bed and Bliss spa products as samples. The Blue Fin restaurant (located on ground level) was excellent (we had Salmon, crabcakes and creme brulee). During my business stay, I couldn't imagine anyne paying $500 a night for this hotel. I would NOT recommend this place for families. This hotel's clientele is 20 somethings with too much $$$ and no class. The staff was very friendly, but the hotel itself was less than desireable. Too many better choices. Not recommended at all."
333,1991,"Sep 3 2005	In the mix	Enjoyed 3 nites at The W where my husband and I found the staff to be extremely accommodating and professional. Kudos to the concierge for some great restaurant recommendations. Centrally located and an easy walk to restaurants, the theatre, Central Park, Rockefeller Center and more. Comfortable room with stylish appointments. Would recommend it highly."
334,1991,"Sep 2 2005	Decent but not great	We were overall dissapointed with this hotel. Given the W name, we were hoping for a better quality experience. The rooms were very small but clean. One of the most annoying features was that the doors don't close softly, but make a horrible bang when closing. We were looking forward to sleeping in on a Sunday, and it was not at all conducive to this. The location is very nice though, and the staff very freindly."
335,1991,"Aug 29 2005	Stylish location	We stayed a the W for tow nights. Its a nice stylish and busy hotel. The size of our room was ok, but some paint a new furniture are necessary if they would like to play in the 5 star league. If you dont want to pay $ 7.00 for a beer from the mini bar, next door is a deli store 24/7."
336,1991,"Aug 21 2005	Overpriced overrated uber-trendy	We stayed at the W Times Square for 4 Nights during July. We booked a Urban Suite for about $550/night!The hotel is very minimalistically designed, and very hip. The bar in the lobby is uber-trendy and the cocktails are great, however service wasn't very good. On weekends the bar pumps, particularly on Saturday nights. If you don't mind coming back to the hotel from your night out, and walking into a &quot;Nightclub-esque&quot; scene, this is for you. If you want a relaxed, non-intimidating stay, I recommend you stay elsewhere. This hotel is aimed at the 20-somethings.When we went to our room we were VERY DISSAPOINTED. The whole room looks extremely cheapely built. The partitions seem to be made of the cheapest, thinnest wood available. The sliding doors on the bathrooms aren't attached properly. Our shower door was missing. When we asked them whether the showers were supposed to have doors or not we were told &quot;some do, some don't&quot;. (i.e. If it came off, we didn't bother to put it back!). There isn't a bath, so all you can do is shower, in the door-less shower, and have water spray everywhere, resulting in you having to creep into the corner of the shower in order to not make a mess. Highly irritating. The basins in the bathrooms are simply &quot;floating&quot; basins with no room on the sides for the soap or anything. This also results in splashing on the floor. The lighting in the both bathrooms was terrible.On a more positive note, the bath products provided are VERY nice, from the salon &quot;Bliss&quot;. The bed was very comfortable. The location of the hotel is perfect if you're from out of town and want to be in the centre of the action. However, I would recommend staying somewhere a bit more quiet, and don't want to be in the &quot;theme-park&quot; part of New York. For first timers, this hotel's location is perfect, for the veteren traveller, perhaps Soho would be better. The best part of the hotel were the concierges, particularly Jonathan. Very friendly and a star at an otherwise average hotel. Extremely helpful, made all out restaurant reservations for our entire stay and managed to get us into some jam-packed places that normally require a month-in-advance reservation, such as Tao, which I highly recommend to anyone seeking an awesome vibey night out with great food and great music! In conclusion, if you are young, flashy, trendy, don't have particularly high hotel standards, and have a LOT of money to throw around, this hotel is for you. The only reason I would want to stay here is because it's so trendy, but it's not a good hotel, you have been warned! If you are a bit older and require a more relaxed and luxurious hotel, stay elsewhere. I found this hotel to be terribly overpriced and felt ripped off. For $500+ a night, I expected a bit more than a nightclub with cheap rooms."
337,1991,"Aug 8 2005	The Best Service!!	Spent two nights with my husband celebrating a milestone birthday. The staff were friendly, considerate and even sent a complimentary bottle of champagne and godiva chocalate to our room while we were out. The rooms were cozy and very romantic and we had a great view of Times Square. The lounge in the main lobby was great for people watching and the dance club downstairs was fun with great music. We even ate at the blue fin which was delicious. If your looking for a great hot weekend stay at this hotel, you won't be disappointed"
338,1991,"Aug 7 2005	Extremely Overrated	This place has all the hype, but little to support to it. We stayed for one night and found the staff to be nice, but not responsive nor responsible. The room itself was just okay and not very clean. For example, we had a small off-white chair in the corner that looked like it was donated from the Salvation Army--not what you would expect for $350. This has all the bells &amp; whistles of a supped up Howard Johnson. Having stayed at numerous 5 star hotels, this place cannot compare. The one pleasant surprise was that there was no extra charge for the air you breathed while staying in the room. In addition, they attempt to extort $6.50 for a bottle of water (that is apparently considered an extra for a $350 room). If you prefer living in lighted surroundings, please be sure to bring a flashlight as there two 30watt bulbs in the entire room. Finally, our call to retrieve our car went completely ignored &amp; we had to wait outside for 30 minutes. If you are used to staying at top notch establishments, do not stay at the W. For this price, look elsewhere!"
339,1991,"Aug 4 2005	Loved the ""W""	Great location, very hip, comfortable beds and great nightlife."
340,1991,"Aug 4 2005	Loved it....	We've just returned from a birthday celebration in New York and wanted somewhere a bit different to stay. I'm pleased to say we found it here - very trendy place with nice rooms and great service. Good bathroom products (Bliss) and really comfortable beds and pillows.We had a corner room which was an upgrade with two windows over Broadway which was superb (if you like to look down on the action which we do!). Good size TV and DVD / CD player with films and music to loan.Good cocktails (reasonably priced for NY) and the Blue Fin restaurant has a great atmosphere and good food. Wine can be a bit pricey but there are some good choices at the lower end ($38).Some comments on this site about the W hotel are a bit negative - yes the corridors are dark, and the decor is minimalist but this is all down to personal taste. It suited us just fine but if you're a chintz lover then you'll hate it. The staff recommended some good restaurants for us and booked tables etc. and everyone was really helpful.Would definitely go again."
341,1991,"Aug 1 2005	Wonderful Stay at the W	We stayed at the W on Times Square July 29-31, 2005. We had a suite on the 28th floor with great views of Times Square. Room was very clean, housekeeping was quick with request for more pillows, towels, shampoos, etc. Loved having Bliss products supplied by the hotel! Incredible bed with down comforter, our suite had two bathrooms, both were very clean.We'd absolutely love to stay there again."
342,1991,Jul 25 2005	Nice hotel w/ friendly staff	I stayed at the W hotel Times Square this past weekend with a few friends. This was my first time in NYC. This hip hotel was in a great location for first time visitors and the staff was very friendly. The room was nice but small (although from what I hear this is typical for hotels in NYC) and not as clean as I would expect from this level of hotel. Overall a positive stay.
343,1991,"Jul 25 2005	Aging Fast	Stayed at the W in Times Square a couple years ago when it first opened and it was amazing. Fun, chic and great location. Stayed at it again a week ago and it is really aging fast - the hip, cool furnishings in the rooms are dirty. The room we stayed in had a plugged sink and one of the mirrors were broken. (We did not report it as it wasn't worth wasting our time on since we had limited time in NY). The staff was hit or miss. For example, check-in was fine but the bar staff was rude and complained about us ordering a mixed drink (the relatively common mojito) that was a 'signature' drink because they had to go to the other end of the bar to make it (for a $12 drink!). Also, for a &quot;hip&quot; hotel it was a joke to see cleaning supllies (mop, bucket, vacuum) out in the bar on a Saturday night at 1 am when the bar was still open and packed....don't get me wrong - this place still has a fantastic location. is still nice and quiet compared to the chaos in Times Square and still often aims to please but the hotel is really declining fast - lets hope not all the &quot;Ws&quot; get this way as this location used to be my gold standard for a 'W'."
344,1991,"Jul 20 2005	Great Location responsive staff	The location can't be beat: close to everything and near beautiful central park. The staff was very responsive to any request we made. As an SPG gold member they upgraded me to the 49th floor and we had an excellent view of Broadway. A bit dark (they need backlighting on the elevator numbers: we old guys cant read the numbers) and a good tourist hotel though not great for business: The cramped business center almost seems to be an afterthought and the room desk was not particularly useful for actual work.Very nice workout center: each workout machine has its own TV, ear phones, weights, water. They play this modern background music constantly and it eventually gets quite old: change up a bit.On balance, we enjoyed our stay though I think equally nice and well located hotels can be had for about 50-75 less per night."
345,1991,"Jul 13 2005	Overpriced and dark	Stayed at this hotel in April. It is is right in the heart of Times Square which was great for a newcomer to the city like myself, however, I don't think I'd want to stay on Time Square again as it is far too busy. The hotel itself was okay, although overpriced (although maybe that is what you have to pay to stay so centrally in NY). The positives about the hotel are: it had a great gym, bed was comfortable, room was quiet and the bar area was quite cool. However, although the hotel was stylish (had funky music playing in the lifts and reception area) most of the staff were unfriendly and pretentious (with an air of superiority - they sort of made you feel like they were doing you a favour by serving you). Also, the decor was very dark (black corridors and grey walls in the rooms), and it was beginning to get slightly shabby (the bathroom in particular could have done with a re-paint). I certainly would not stay at this hotel if I had children. Overall, I don't think I would stay at this hotel for future trips to NY as it was a little overpriced and felt unwelcoming."
346,1991,"Jul 8 2005	Could be better	We stayed for 6 nights at the W Times Square, and though this is purportedly the &quot;flagship&quot; for the W chain, we found it somewhat &quot;dirty&quot; for lack of a better word.Call me picky, but I don't particularly care to see large brown stains of indeterminate origins on the blinds, and I don't want to see trash beneath the bed. The hotel needs a little more upkeep.ln the upside, the hotel is in a great central location, and though it is in crazy Time Square, it was remarkably quiet. The lobby area is the typical uber-chic W style with a happening bar scene. The staff was helpful and the concierge was helpful, though they could not get us a reservation at PerSe... (apparently takes an act of God)"
347,1991,"Jun 28 2005 	Too much trendy not enough quality	The good: free Bliss products, trendy nightclub scene, quiet hotel for one with Times Sqr location (i'm talking about the street noise), it's where the &quot;beautiful people&quot; stay, friendly staff, cool music.The bad: Poor quality especially for the price. Stayed several times, each room was worn out. White furniture shows age and dirt. Beds are standard hotel, not the &quot;heavenly beds&quot; of sister Westin brand. Doors are thin, can hear music from hall. Closet door is hallow. Bathroom is made of cheap fixtures. Sliding door and bathroom walls probably came from Ikea, which isn't bad except your paying a luxury hotel price for it. Shower curtain standard dirty hotel issue. Shower tiles standard bathroom tiles, where's the marble or fancy stone? Wall of mirrors in your room is a bit cheesy.If you need trendy, stay at the Westin Times Sqr, if you want value, stay at the Waldorf Astoria. If you absolutely must stay with all the trendy Europeans visiting NYC, then stay here."
348,1991,"Jun 18 2005 	Consistent and Comfortable	I have stayed at many hotels, up and down the scale... I have to rank this hotel as one of my favorites because it's consistent and the location is convienant (heart of times square, never short of a cab, expensive/cheap food can be found around the corner, starbucks and mcdonalds around the corner, etc). I typically stay away from modern Ian Schragger type hotels (HATE THEM)... so despite the modern/hip decor at this hotel, I like it because it's a new hotel compared to the other two W hotels on the east side (renovated apartment building). Those rooms are tiny and the fixures are OLD... at this location, it's modern, clean and comfortable. The rooms are comfortably spacey (not large but decent for NY), the beds/comforters always meet expectations, the service is good... the concierage always makes good restaurant recommendations.The only negative is that the lobby acts as a bar (during the weekends it gets pretty crowded). The music can be loud but it doesn't carry to the room."
349,1991,"Jun 13 2005	Nice Hotel but needs improvement	Just got back from the W hotel in Times square. The hotel was a very nice hotel and most of the staff was very friendly. There were a couple things we didnt like about the hotel - when we got there our tv didnt work, and we could not get our door to stay closed. they had to come up and fix both. Not a big deal but just wanted to point them out.The bathrooms are tiny, no seperation between the toilet and the shower. So very little privacy. The shower door sucked and every time we took a shower the bathroom got water everywhere. Our main complaint was the rudeness of the bartender in the main bar. The gal kept making our drinks wrong according to the drink menu and when we finally brought it to her attention she became even ruder. At $12.50 a pop, we were not very happy. We had to get the bar manager involved who offered very little except to remake our last drink (we spent $300 at the bar over 3 days which isnt a ton considering the drink prices) The next day i spoke to the hotel manager who was very apolgetic and credited our drinks from the previous night. The bar manager told us the bar was a seperate entity and not part of the hotel, which we really could care less about, we just wanted hassle free service. The hotel staff was amazing. They were all so nice. The door guys were always so friendly, and the concierge made reservations for us in some of the nicest places. We had a blast.I worked out every morning in the hotel gym, which was full of basic precor equipment, and had lots of cardio. We had a massage and a facial, the massage was nice, the facial was not so great.We dropped about $1,000 the whole time we were at the hotel as it was our anniversary and the only complaint we really had was the rudeness of the hotel bar girl with long frizzy hair LOLThere is a great deli next door with cold drinks, great food, and open 24 hours. Also a starbucks about 300 feet from the front door.There is also a roxy deli about 4 stores down, a planet hollywood with a great bartender (we went there after the w hotel girl was rude to us), and walking distance to some great places.If you have any questions drop us a line. Also I buy unwanted american air miles if anyone has any.good luck"
350,1991,"Jun 6 2005	Comfortable 	We enjoyed our stay at the W hotel. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and quiet. It was amazing how quiet the hotel is compared to the noise and action of Times Square. The location was very convienent.The decor was modern featuring darker colors, which I found quite pleasing (especially after having my senses assaulted by the HONKING and blaring lights outside). The staff was friendly and greeted us each time we left and returned to the hotel. I did not have any problems with the staff as everyone was very accomodating. I searched long and hard for a hotel within this price range that would offer the convienence and cleanliness. The W is a good place to stay. Upon return I would like to stay in a different area besides Times Square (though it was a good experience as a first time visitor to NYC.) Greenwich Village and SoHo as well as the business district would be a nice place to stay. Good luck on your travels."
351,1991,"Jun 3 2005	Fun and friendly	I have just returned having stayed at the W for 5 nights .Although there were a few teething problems with my requested room , these were soon resolved to our satisfaction. Infact the hotel and staff couldn`t have been more friendly and helpful. I thought the hotel was excellent value as they let my 17 year old daughter and friend stay in the room with us for free. I booked direct with Starwood using the internet special rate and i would certainly reccomend this hotel if you are looking for something a bit different . The location is excellent if you like to be in the &quot;hub of it all&quot; .Credit goes out to all the genuine friendly staff who made out stay a pleasure ."
352,1991,"Jun 1 2005 	a dissapointment in the cleanliness department	I will confess, I am a bit of a neat-freak, and going to hotels makes me wary. I have heard nothing but wonderful things about the Starwood hotel chains, and their commitment to excellence. The staff had an attitude, but that is something I can overlook, seeing that they were incredibly busy seeing that it is Times Square (however a smile goes a long way). The lobby was in very good shape, and I was feeling positive about my stay, until I got off the elevator. The stained hallways should have been my first clue. The room was certainly not up to my standards. And by that I mean stained linens, and a hair or two in my shower, which makes me question when they last cleaned it. Perhaps it was just a hair from the cleaning personnel, but I don't care. Next time I think I will stay at a different hotel a bit outside of Times Square. I've heard nice things about the Royalton and The City Club. I think I'll book a room at one of those in the future."
353,1991,May 23 2005	Too Overpriced	This hotel was very nice. I liked the theme and the room was ok although for the price very small. I expected alot more for what I payed for this hotel.
354,1991,"May 19 2005	Not that great.	Location is good.Hotel staff has an attitude, maybe that 's normal at a W Hotel. Hotel is very dark, and rooms are not as clean as one would expect from this chain. Also disputed a charge added to the bill that was in error. This was removed but showed up on card again a month later. There are better places to stay in NYC."
355,1991,"May 13 2005	Way overpriced	I certainly would not stay at the W again and am sorry for my bad experience. I felt the room was not exceptionally clean, which I would have expected. Also, they really could lose the comforter covers - they are silk and would never stay on the bed, just slid right off if you moved. Also, the temperature of the room could never be adjusted correctly."
356,1991,"May 6 2005	Ok but felt a bit dirty	It was not an awful stay, but it felt like the room was dirty. Wtih all the black paint, it was hard to really see how far it went. The staff was nice and the location was good. Overall, I had a nice trip, but I wouldn't stay here again."
357,1991,"May 4 2005	Caveats	The W Hotel offered us a very good rate in NYC, and the rooms are very comfortable and clean. However, the bathrooms are too small and it's difficult to maneuver even with small items like hair dryers, etc -- little or no counter space. In addition, the bar service (2 of them) completely ignored us as we sat there, in plain view, for over 20 minutes. They were not that busy and kept on serving other people who came in after us."
358,1991,"Apr 29 2005	Ok little bit overpriced	We stayed at W Times Square from April 21-24, 2005. We were really looking forward to our stay there since this hotel has the best location in all Times Square! Last year, we stayed at W Lakeshore in Chicago and had the best weekend of our life, so we were looking forward to this weekend as well.The hotel is very nice, although I'll have to say that the lobby is too bright and is not cozy at all. In addition, if you want to use the gym and are staying in the upper rooms, you need to take 2 elevators to do so. The good thing is that you can waive the $20 entrance fee for it's lounge if you are a hotel guest. Overall, the hotel is great but I'd rather return to the one in Chicago (watch out since there are 2 in the area) than to this one."
359,1991,"Apr 29 2005	Over rated staff has never heard of the Starwood promise	It's a shame this hotel has a wonderful bar and rest. However for the price I would avoid staying here if you are bothered by heat when you sleep. The hotel rooms have only heat during the winter months and A/C in the summer. Unfortunately for me during March the temperatures went in the 60's. The sun heated the hotel all day making the room temp reach the 80's. The hotel did not have enough fans for all the requests by guests. When I complained to the front desk they said I was one of many guests who complained but there was nothing that could be done. (I have no idea why they didn't just turn the A/C on). Anyway I reminded them of the Starwood promise such as a free room or extra Starwood points if not satisfied, the girl at the front desk pretended like she had never heard of it. There are much better places to stay in Times Square for the price."
360,1991,"Apr 23 2005	Very very chic....loved it.	My family(mom,dad,sister, and myself)just got back yesterday from our first trip to NYC. I just loved this hotel. It was very chic and trendy, and decorated very nicely. The beds were beyond comfortable, the staff was very, very, very, very friendly, and it's in a great location. I was in awe from the moment I stepped in the hotel. The rooms were not exactly huge, but still a good size for New York. I will definetly stay there the next time I go to NYC!"
361,1991,"Apr 22 2005	This hotel puts you off New York completely	If you want to feel unwelcome in a foreign city, this is the hotel where you should stay. First, there is the check-in from hell. I was at first refused stay in this hotel because my room was paid for by Starwood points!!!! (That already defeats the purpose of collecting points for free stays by choosing Starwood hotels over other chains.) Check-in staff and in particular, one Nick Ivezaj, seem to have had their training in a military camp. Never have I encountered such unfriendly, arrogant and impolite staff.Secondly, the standard of cleanliness leaves much to be desired. The hotel also runs out of toiletries, I believe, in a bid to make you purchase the full size products they have on sale in the bedroom.Thirdly, it is a badly-lit hotel where you can hardly see anything, especially in the common areas. If you want to experience the feeling of staying in a bat cave, that's the place to go!Lastly, but most importantly, I was charged incorrectly for meetings/conventions expenses, when I was there on holiday for the Easter break and certainly not on business. So beware of extra charges on your dedit/credit card statements when you get back home. It seems they will do anything to get extra money from you.So avoid this hotel by all means when staying in New York. There are hundreds of other hotels which are much better."
362,1991,"Apr 17 2005	Just W.onderderland... 	We just Loved it...Wonderful views, beautiful design, staff with the right attitude. Fab location.The hotel: located on Times SquareThe room: Good size for NYC, Bliss sample bag, CD player to play you favourite music. Packed with little extras to make your life easier. Coffee maker. Bathrobe.Big bathroom.Had a corner room on the 47th floor. Fab view on Times Square.Not much wardrobe/storage space.Bar: very trendy, relax atmosphere. The only place in the hotel the staff was not very pleasant."
363,1991,"Apr 12 2005	Excellent LOVED IT!	I recently stayed at the W Times Square for 1 night. We had a GREAT time. The staff were excellent, from check-in to housekeeping to concierge - it was flawless all 'round. Gone is the typical 'W' attitude I've seen elsewhere, and there was a genuine desire to have guests comfortable.We got a corner room on the 57th (top) floor that was &quot;Spectacular&quot; (their description for it. It really was - we asked for the upgrade and somehow got it. The room was large for NYC, with great sound insulation. The bathrooms were a tad tight, but modern and efficient. The room furniture was extremely modern and funky. The bed was excellent, perfect sheets, comfortable pillows and a lovely bed spread. Each room had an iron, awesome bath robes (really comfortable!), and plenty of great bathroom 'Bliss' products (which are displayed prominently in your room for sale - a tiny bit disappointing).The location is brilliant, right on Times Square, the downstairs bar is a happening place (recommended for 20-30 yr olds).Definitely 5 stars for me. Would stay here again for the location, quiet rooms, and fantastic beds! (photo I took attached)"
364,1991,"Apr 11 2005	Great experience	I just returned from a 3-day stay. My 10-year-old daughter and I were doing a father-daughter Broadway trip. This hotel is nicely designed inside and out, and the great location is self-evident. It is clearly aimed at the 20-40-year-old set, but the staff were delightful in their interactions with my daugher. The big burly too-cool ultra-hip staff always had an extra wink or grin for her, even as they were trying to look cool to the other clients. The service was commendable in all aspects. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Midtown."
365,1991,"Apr 5 2005	Fantastic! Exceed all expectations!	Stayed at the W Times Square for 3 days. Check in was fast and efficent. We got a corner room on the 46th floor with one window that gave us a view of the Times Square tower and the other window of Uptown and the Hershey store. Large for NYC, EXCELLENT BED, and great sound insulation. I could never hear the elevators and our room was right behind them nor could I hear conversations from the room next to us. All the complaints about lack of counterspace or water spilling out into the floor of the bathroom due to the lack of a complete door didn't affect me. PLenty of counter space and water wasn't splashing out. If you need more counter space don't bring a palooza of stuff and if your water spashes out, what are you doing? Flailing your arms? Cab and elevator service were fast and next to the elevators on the floors they have cute little TV's that play MTV but have no sound. Would return again in a heartbeat. Plus you can't beat location like that. (For us it, perfect view, close to subway and literally across the street from where Aida was playing.) A+++++"
366,1991,"Apr 4 2005	nice hotel but.....	Stayed in New York a number of times and would recomend the Hiltons over the W. We normally do not stay in Times Square due to the horrible traffic and touristy shops, ie, Hershey, wax museums you get the picture. The hotel rooms at the W are small, typical of most NYC hotel rooms, it was very clean and the view we had was pretty good, not all rooms have a nice view ask to stay in rooms ending with 12. The rooms even above the 42nd floor were noisy. The heater system was on and did not convert to A/C. This means you had to open your window to the noise of Times Square. The rooms and hallways are dark and are painted gray which gives the place a modern club feel if this is your bag. One of the concierge gentlemen was very helpful, the other needed therapy for his poor attitude. The other staff people were excellent. Towels deliverd to the room were quick. The lobby, as most hotels in times square, is small and crowded. You have to transfer elevators twice to get to your room, check in and the bar is on 7th. The decor of the hotel I would call modern with an edge of tacky, but clean. Most rap stars would consider it classsy. When checking hotel rooms ask for the size of the room by sqare footage, the Hilton Times Square, the Ritz at Battery Park and some of the newer hotels have larger rooms. Stay at central park, upper east side it is much much nicer and you can get to times square if you want to catch a show. Do not use carmel car service, the car into the city was nice the one going out was filthy."
367,1991,"Mar 23 2005 	A swanky place to stay!	I just got back from staying at the W for 3 nights and it was a great place to stay. I was attending a conference at the Marriott Marquis and chose to stay away from the conference crowds and booked a room at the W. The entrance is on 47th away from the hustle and bustle of Broadway, which was perfect. When I checked in, my room wasn't ready yet so I left my bags with them and went on my way. When I returned later that evening to pick up my room key, my bags were delivered less than 5 minutes after I got to my room! My room was really nice - the bed and pillows were SO comfortable. The only noise I could hear was anyone talking loudly in the hallways but that hardly happened during my stay. You couldn't hear any of the street noise at all. The bar/lounge area in the lobby looked really cool but I didn't get a chance to hang out there. The housekeeping staff was very nice and helpful and promptly responded to my requests for more towels, toiletries or service. Room service was prompt and the food was delicious. I had a couple of wrong charges on my bill and they took care of it without hesitation or question. If I ever come back to NYC, I'll be sure to stay here again!"
368,1991,"Mar 22 2005	W Hotel - Times Square	This is a difficult review to write. The hotel on it's own is wonderful. The beds are so comfortable, the rooms a bit small but nice, and we had a tremendous view from our room on the 54th floor. We did not have any problems with any of the staff at the actual hotel, they were friendly and accomodating.We encountered only one problem while we were there. We were blamed for making too much noise and a hotel representative came to the room and was actually quite rude about it. Well, it wasn't our room, we were asleep, it was the next room, we were the ones that made the call! After bringing this to their attention, we were not even given an apology for their staff's behavior and attitude.The problem is with the support or lack their of of the STARWOOD group and their telephone and customer service people. They were terrible, rude, and never addressed some problems we had with the allocation of our STARWOOD Points and a couple of issues. The problem was so bad that my company cancelled our account with them. So beware!Summary: The hotel is nice, good location and comfortable. The staff is good, the support before and after will be nonexistent."
369,1991,Mar 17 2005	Superb location	W-Hotel Times Square has a fantastic location and for a first time visitor to NY this hotel offered us the complete NY experience.The hotel definitely leans towards the late twenties/thirties age group and has a lively bar in the hotel lobby. The greeting at reception and the help we received with room service was superb and the concierge was extremely helpful and even called through 20 Irish pubs when trying to locate me a place to watch the Ireland v England rugby match at 10am in the morning!The rooms are good sized and the beds are fantastic.My only downside was the bar in the hotel. The girl serving our table actually complained when we only gave her a $4 tip for two drinks! I explained that we were planning on spending the evening in the bar and would probably order 6 or 7 drinks throughout the evening and if she expected us to tip her $4-5 each time then she was mad! I then realise that nobody in NY does anything for you through politeness as everyone is expecting a tip! That really took the shine of an otherwise superb stay
370,1991,"Mar 17 2005	Good hotel if you don't mind noise.	I stayed at the W for 4 nights Christmas 04. I was going to stay at the Plazza but after reading reviews on here it was the only hotel i could change to at short notice. Overall it wasn't too bad, i had a average sized corner room looking onto Times Square, my only real complaint about the room is that the walls are paper thin, someone from cali said &quot;good soundproof rooms&quot; i'll guarantee you this hotel has no such thing, you can hear every single word spoken within 10ft of your room, they should supply ear plugs, as it's obviously a young/vibrant location, it would make the rooms far more restfull.The staff were ok, i'm starting to see a trend with usless check in procedures, i emailed and rang ahead of my visit to confirm i would be arriving early from the UK and would like early check in, i was told this would be fine. Arriving at 11:30 am our room wasn't ready unitl 4pm, this would never happen in any hotel that valued their customers. Concierge was unhelpful, the bar was quite good, however they kept reserving most of the seating area every evening for what looked like friends of the security/bar staff.Above all the location is fantastic, taxi's were always outside the Blue Fin restaraunt was very nice, if not over priced, (even for NY).I won't stay here again unless it's for a very good price and i take ear plugs, i feel there's better hotels in NY in this price range."
371,1991,"Mar 13 2005	Pretty good	Just got back from a 6 night stay. Got upgraded to a corner room on the 47th floor. Had great views of the river and the skyline on one side. The other side was another hotel.Bathroom seemed to have been a little worn out and the shower did tend to splash out a little (though a floor mat solves the problem).Room itself was an alright size. Bed was a little short for some reason, though really comfortable!Check in staff was very helpful though concierge did seem a little strange stand-offish at times. Bell hops and door men were practically ignoring people.Overall, a great hotel for singles/couples with the buzzing lounges and superb location. I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay here again. The redeeming factor for me was the view, without it I wouldnt know how chuffed I would have been with the hotel."
372,1991,"Mar 8 2005	Loved the W	I loved this place. The decor is great and though the rooms are small, it's very modern with a spectacular lobby. And of course, the location is fabulous."
373,1991,"Mar 6 2005	Poor Service and Depressing Techno Rave Hotel	My son and I had reservations for 4 nights at the &quot;W&quot; in a &quot;spectacular&quot; room. We arrived at 11:30 am and asked to be placed on a priority check in since we knew we might not be able to check in that early and I informed them we had a 5:30 dinner reservation. ( Check in is 3:00 pm ). I had reserved a non smoking room with 2 double beds 2 months out. The check in clerk said &quot; your room will not be ready until around 2:00pm. We have you in a king size bed &quot;smoking&quot; room. I informed him I had asked for 2 double beds and a non smoking room. He said &quot; Do you have your confirmation that shows proof you had asked for a non-smoking room with 2 double beds ?&quot; I produced my copy of the &quot;W&quot; 's email and it did not state smoking or non-smoking. He said well if you &quot;had&quot; reserved a non-smoking room it would have said so. He said we can move you to a non smoking room tomorrow but you will have to stay in a smoking room tonite. I have never had a desk clerk &quot;question&quot; my integrity and insinutated that I was trying to deceive him !!! This is customer service ? We then spent the next 30 minutes trying to locate a luggage check, since they dont check it for you at the desk. I approached the one person that I saw manning the luggage cart and issuing claim tickets and she said, &quot; Im sorry you will have to wait until I return&quot;. She returned 20 minutes later and was mobbed by all the other people waiting in the lobby! Why should it take almost an hour to check your bag? We lfinally checked our bags and went out on the city to have lunch and returned to the hotel at 3:00 pm to find our room not ready. The lobby was filled with about 70 -80 other guests &quot;waiting&quot; for their rooms also. Techno -new wave music blasts 24-7 in the lobby and elevators so much so its very difficult to even hear the check in clerk or concierge. The lobby is one small dark very very loud bar. At 4:15 pm our room was still not ready so I asked to speak to the manager. (It seems they hate when you ask that.) The desk clerk disappeared for about 10 minutes and returned with a reservation for a cheaper room than what I had reserved. I took it. She said that it was a non smoking with 2 double beds and was $289. So at 4:30 pm I finally was able to check in and get dressed for a 5:30 pm dinner reservation. No one offered to show us to our room which is not easy to find given that the corridors walls and ceilings are painted black making it very hard to see where you are going and the room numbers. All weekend we smelled cigarette smoke coming through the adjacent room door and bathroom exhaust. The closet was no more than 2 feet wide ( and this included the ironing bd ) The room was equally small and very dimly lit with no where to open your suit case except the floor. The walls and doors are poor construction. You can hear everything being said in the adjacent room and hallways. The beds are great but what good is that if you cant sleep due to the noise and smell of cigarette smoke ? At check out, they charged me $309 for my room instead of the $289 they had written on my check in card. This is the worst property I have ever stayed in and will never stay in a W hotel anywhere. If this is indicative of the Starwood Properties then I will avoid those too. There are much better and cheaper places in New York that have real &quot;cool&quot; appeal. Try the Chambers Hotel for true cool appeal and an incredible restful sleep and excellent service."
374,1991,Mar 3 2005	Delightful buzzy Hotel	Just returned from a three night break in New York staying at the W Hotel Times Square. Fabulous hotel - very buzzy especially at night in the bar on the 7th floor. The hotel was brilliant and the staff could not have been more helpful. The room was a delight - we were on the 33rd floor with a view over part of Times Square and the neon lights. Loved everything about the holiday although our legs were aching with all the walking we did. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in the centre of Times Square and within walking distances of lots of attractions.
375,1991,"Feb 27 2005	Great Location	My husband and I stayed one night at the W Hotel in Times Square. We are from the area (husband works in Manhattan), so this was more of a simple night away from home for us rather than a &quot;big trip to the Big Apple.&quot; The room was clean and the staff was friendly. I particularly liked the Bliss bath and body products, the complimentary cotton bathrobe, and the comfy down comforter. If you're from out of town, this is a great location, as you're certainly in the hubbub of it all. Excellent access to all the major tourist attractions. I would recommend this hotel mostly to the younger folk (under 50), as it was a bit trendy and chic, with dark hallways and low lighting in most areas. However, not a major issue at all."
376,1991,"Feb 21 2005	Awesome!	This was one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had in New York - and I've stayed around. From the welcome at the entrance to the minute we left, everything was great. The rooms are very nice and the location is perfect. The people were so friendly without being over the top and everytime I saw someone they would say hello and ask how I was. The hotel is very clean and overall a pleasure to stay in."
377,1991,"Feb 20 2005	Wonderful hotel perfect location	We stayed at the W December 19-22, 2005, and we LOVED it. The experience was wonderful from the time we stepped into the front door. The decor was unlike any I have ever seen in a hotel before-very modern and relaxing. Our room was number 3404. I am very picky about hotels, but I felt like this room was clean and well maintained. It had a mirrored headboard that went all the way to the ceiling. The bathroom had a shower (no tub) with a clear glass door. Everything is decorated in shades of gray, silver, and black. It is dark, but not in a bad way. We really loved the room. The only problem was the view. I had requested a room with a view of Broadway, but we could only barely see it from the bottom corner of the window. Most of our view was into the rooms of the hotel next door. The windows can only be opened about 3 inches, so you can't lean your head out to see any better. I would recommend requesting a room number ending in 01 such as 3401, so there would be a good view of Times Square. The staff was very helpful and friendly the entire time, and the location is wonderful. If you check on different websites and find a rate lower than their site offers they will match that price plus 10%. That saved us quite a bit because it is quite expensive. I would highly recommend this hotel."
378,1991,"Feb 7 2005	FABULOUS!!!	Stayed here last week - the whole experience from start to finish was pretty flawless! Room was big by Manhattan standards and beautifully furnished - I guarantee you will have the best nights sleep of your life in the huge marshmallow beds! Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel has just the right mix of being fashionable and stylish without being pretentious. Breakfast in the adjoining Blue Fin restaurant is a must. And if you want an easy night of people watching with great food, drink and service, start off with cocktails in the 7th floor lobby bar followed by dinner in the 400 seat Blue Fin restaurant."
379,1991,"Feb 5 2005	Great hotel	I've stayed at the W Times Square twice - once in July, 2004, and a second time in January, 2005. Was very happy both times, and got a great government rate. The front desk staff is very professional and friendly. The rooms are large as NYC goes, and they sample Bliss products, which are fun. The rooms are clean, and the housekeeping staff is vigilant and polite. Concierge quite helpful. There are subway stops all around the hotel, so you can quite easily and quickly get anywhere you might wish to go. There is a 24-hour hot deli right next door, which is great! (Try their breakfast sandwiches - they are wonderful). I agree with the poster who said that this hotel is probably not the best selection for those with children - but this is a great hotel for singles and adults. The bar is hopping! The fitness room is a bit small, but the treadmills and elliptical trainers each have their own tv (although not all were working when we were there), which is a nice diversion. Also, if you become a Starwood Preferred Member (it's free - sign up at the front desk), you can get airline miles, which I use. I will happily stay here again."
380,1991,Jan 20 2005	Perfect Weekend	I took my wife the NYC for our 10th anniversary. The room was fantastic and the service was great. You have to be careful of some of the concierge recommendations for restaurants. They are more interested in the 'scene' than the cuisine. Rooms this big at this price are hard to find.
381,1991,"Jan 18 2005	W Times Square is Amazing	I have stayed at the W Times Square 7 times and each and every experience was amazing. I was there most recently from 01.13.05 - 01.17.05. Everything about the hotel is first class. Which is all the more amazing given that it is right in the middle of times square, which at times can border on over-the-top tacky. The rooms are well appointed and extremely comfortable and now feature Bliss bath products. The staff is super friendly and professional. The Living Room bar is very hip and the bartendars are great. Lastly, the Blue Fin has excellent food and is always bustling. Can't think of one negative thing to say about the place other than your best bet on rooms would be to request a room without an adjoing door, these rooms are more sound proof than the ones that have a door adjoining another room.Stay at the W and enjoy.For great dining options in the area, try Marseilles on 44th and 9th, Etcetera Etcetera on 44th between 9th and 8th [this place is brand new and the staff is a blast, espcially Joe] 44 and X on 44th and 10th and Thalia at 49th and 8th.For Bars and Clubs try Xth Avenue Lounge [Tyler rocks], Therapy and Barrage. Xth and Therapy are somewhat mixed, Barrage is mostly gay."
382,1991,"Jan 18 2005	Perfect for a NY weekend!	We spent a weekend at the W in February 2002, and it still sticks in my mind as one of the best hotels we have stayed in.Our room was small, but this is a trait of most W rooms so was not unexpected. However the fixtures, fittings and amenities were second to none - the bed was pure luxury!Room service for breakfast was excellent, and the hotel bar was buzzing on Saturday night with lots of NY trendy types, which may be off-putting for some but for us it was the perfect place to enjoy a few (expensive) cocktails.After this experience, we'll always seek out a W when visiting the States and hope to stay at the W Sydney later this year.Highly recommended!"
383,1991,"Jan 13 2005 	GREAT EXPERIENCE!	Great location if you want to be in the middle of it all.. nice, BIG soundproof rooms, good service, wonderful ammenities, beautiful bar, it's like being in your own little world right in the middle of it ALL! ENJOY!"
384,1991,"Jan 11 2005	Good all rounder	My family and I went to the New York for my daughters 21st birthday, staying at the 'W' Time Square, and we all agreed it was a wonderfull experience, the Manager, and all members of staff were very helpfull, from booking very good resturants, to giving directions and getting cabs.Its very central for very good eating places / bars, and site seeing, we ate in the Blue Fin, highly reccomended. The beds and pillows were the best ever, also the rooms were very clean and classy, with a good mini bar, I would suggest staying on a high floor, as this gives you less street noise. When we go back to NYC, it will be on the top of our list."
385,1991,"Jan 5 2005	Don't break anything!!	Great location, good rooms, service however left a lot to be desired - concierge was rude as were the lobby staff unwelcoming but have to say all the housekeeping staff were excellent, - and if you break anything you will be charged believe me!! So if it happens, get an invoice and check your rights!!"
386,1991,"Dec 24 2004	Do not miss this Wonderful Experience!	Having visited New York City on several vacations (and roomed at a different hotel each time), I stayed at the W-Times Square for the first time during my most recent NYC visit (12/19/04 through 12/21/04) and fully endorse the entire W experience. The ambiance  lighting, dcor and aroma  is chic yet not gaudy. The employees seem genuine, friendly and quite helpful. The location is superb as most everything generally considered touristy (e.g. Theatre District, Radio City, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Empire State Building, and Times Square) may be reached by walking, which is the best way to see New York anyway. Appropriately, the NYC finale is the return to the tranquility of a peaceful oasis with a well-stocked mini-bar and truly heavenly bed that makes for an exceptionally restful slumber. Definitely a place to lodge at least once, the W-Times Square is the place to which I hope to return for future NYC visits."
387,1991,"Dec 12 2004	Totally chic hip relaxing	We stayed at the W Times Square from Dec. 7-11, 2004. After a 2 1/2 hour plane delay because of fog and rain, we arrived at the W around 10PM. Found the lobby on the 7th floor and checked in tired and hungry. Simply asked the deck clerk for a nice room with a view. We were escorted up to the 42nd floor and had an incredible corner room with views all around us. Unpacked and headed down to their restaurant Blue Fin around 10:30. Had no reservation, dressed in jeans and could not have been treated any better. The Maitre'D was friendly, our waiter was great and the manager chatted us up before we left. Had a wonderful appetizer, cocktail and headed for our room.The room is cozy in size with ammenities everywhere. Bliss bath products, 300 count ironed linens, fax machine, portable phones, indirect mood lighting, pillows by the dozen, cd player with soothing W music etc. We were concerned with street noise and bright lights being in Times Square. The blinds darkened the room beautifully and we had our soft music on 24/7 to help with street noise.The living room (accross from check in on 7th floor) is a wonderful place for cocktails. Large leather chairs and sofas with pillows. This is a great hang out for pre shopping cocktails, after shopping cocktails, pre dinner cocktails, post dinner cocktails....you get the picture.We ordered room service twice. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. Both were wonderfulThe concierge desks were very helpful. We especially liked Gilmar. He has been doing this for a while and you can tell enjoys his job.Don't miss the aromatherapy packages they offer. We took advantage of the relaxation one. For $25 you get a relaxation CD, temple oil, eye bag and chamomile pillow insert. Helped us sleep like babies. In fact, I purchased more for Christmas presents as we left.As I read some of the previous reviews, I am stunned. My only conclusion is that The W was not a good match for these travelers. This is definitely a hip, chic hotel. Not for those who want the traditional grand lobbied, formally clad doormen, high tea afternoon hotels."
388,1991,"Nov 30 2004	The beds are the only good thing about this hotel	I stayed at the W times square from 11-20 thru 11-26. I actually purchased the hotel on Starwood.com, and im a Starwood preferred guest, so I would of thought I would of gotten a better room on a high floor, but I was placed with-in the first 5 floors. The room was small but worth it for the comfortable Heavenly bed. We were the only ones on the floor, except for Wed. night. You could here the neighbors talking the walls are so thin. Needless to say, it was the only night we had neighbors, so I shouldn't be complaining but BEWARE****the walls are very thin at this hotel***** Location was ideal (right in the middle of Times Square), yet one must go thru 2 elevators to get to actual hotel room. 1st elevator brings you to the lobby, and from there you hop on another elevator to get to the room. The staff, doorman, bellhops, were great, as for the reservation check in clerks, they were sooo snobby, it was hysterical. They all acted like they were so refined and well-educated, dressed in their black outfits with little W emblem pins on their shirts/coats....This isn't Broadway, its a hotel!!!!! Oh and might I add, we requested a late check out (we called the previous night...starwood preferred guests get a 4pm late check out upon request) and when we got back to the hotel, we were locked out, and due to this we almost missed our town car to the airport, since we had to get another key made up.Anyway, if the rate is right I might stay here again, solely for the bed which is nice after days of walking."
389,1991,"Nov 27 2004	This is supposed to be a hotel? I thought it was a warehouse!	This was, without a doubt, one of the worst W Hotels I've ever stayed at. You enter from Broadway into a small room and take elevators up. The entry-hall way was somewhat beautiful, but this was decieving. The elevator music, to say the least, is intrusive and loud. The lobby, on the 7th floor, is REALLY dark. Its really depressing. The lobby, which is really just a bar, is crowded with drunks who are shouting like no tommarow. Definitely not the place for a family. If you can find the elevators without using a flashlight, you are taken up in a dark elevator to your room. The hallways are painted black and dimily lit, not to mention small (about 7-8ft wide). I would never stay here again! (Stay at the Marriott a block down... Its by far a better hotel)."
390,1991,"Nov 25 2004	WONDERFUL!!!	I stayed at the W in mid October. First time in the Big Apple, I couldn't of asked for a better hotel.It was chic, trendy, upbeat, the best hotel I've stayed at anywhere by far! Very boutique and very sophisticated, good-looking people everywhere and definitley the place to be! Cool decor and VERY informative, well dressed concierge staff!I personally enjoy a more boutique like property with a party scene and if you do, this is the place to be. I stayed at the Marriott down the street my last night and was not impressed, not compared the the W Times Square. Rooms were funky and oooh so comfortable and the spa was great!HIGHLY RECOMMEND to the chic clientele only!"
391,1991,"Nov 23 2004	W must stand for wonderful	After arriving to the airport in palm beach I realized that I had forgotten my credit card, and had very little cash on me. I knew that the hotel would need a copy of my cc to check in. Once i explained what had happened. The hotel then allowed me to write a check for my three night stay there, then allowed me to write a 200.00 check a day for cash. They saved my life. Not to mention the service was great!!! And the conceirge got me into every trendy club without standing in line. The view was great the room was great. At times I found my self not wanting to leave the hotel."
392,1991,"Nov 5 2004	possibly the best yet	W just keeps getting better and this one may be the best yet. Every one who works here is freindly and makes you feel like they care about you, it is fun we loved it and location is great."
393,1991,"Nov 5 2004	Great hotel great location great staff.. i loved this W!!	Don't care about reviews talking about W Times Square as a bad hotel.. try this amazing W and you'll have a wonderful stay!! I loved this hip hotel.. it was my first time in NYC and W is the perfect starting point for a tour of the city! The staff is really kind and helpful, Blue Fin restaurant is definetly tasty (maybe a little pricey, but dining in Times Square is an experience which worth every penny) and the rooms are sooo nice!! I loved the dark colors inside the hotel, the lobby and the music playin' all around the hotel!! Thank you W for making my trip to NYC an unforgettable experience!!"
394,1991,"Oct 3 2004	not worth the star rating	Recently stayed here for a long weekend with some girl friends. It is well located and the bar is good (if noisy and somewhat pretentious).However, for the price ($500 per night) the room was cramped (not unexpected for New York but if there are 3 people sharing you would expect sufficient towels...) and the service was the worst I've ever seen in any hotel anywhere (and I'm including bargain basement hotels in central paris here..). Slow, unable to understand your requirements (we had a booking for 4 people and they tried to put us in a double room).On the plus side, the room was clean, nicely done out and their was sufficient space etc in the bathroom for toiletries (complimentary stuff is very nice). You're paying for the name and location. Better off booking somewhere else where you're not paying for the &quot;image&quot; and attitude"
395,1991,"Sep 26 2004	Excellent Hotel	Me and my husband stayed overnight on 9/25/04 because we were celebrating my birthday. I totally DISAGREE with all of the negative comments about the hotel. I am originally from Manhattan so I am very familar with what goes on in the Big Apple. Now for starters, if you are a person who is somewhat LAID-BACK, New York City is not the place for you. Perhaps you should consider staying at one of the Sheraton Hotels located a few blocks up on 7th Avenue. Those hotels are very laid-back and cater to the people on business trips or someone wanting a more quiet atmosphere. We previously stated at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers and we were BORED. It was just too quiet for us. The W Times Square is located in the heart of Times Square which is visited by thousands of tourist daily. There are so many people everywhere and a lot of energy. Me and my hubby are party people so we enjoyed the energy. We have stayed at several Starwood Hotels and I found the W Times Square to be more elegant and full of ENERGY. The staff is very nice and very attentive to the guest. I loved the decor of hotel as well as the room. I was impressed by the decor in the room as soon as I opened the door. The room has unique decor with beveled mirrors and a kingsize bed with comfortable pillows and a goosedown comforter. We slept so good after dinner and a show at Caroline's Comedy Club. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who loves the party scene. We will definitely return to this hotel."
396,1991,"Sep 13 2004	Targets the>35 Crowd	Crystal chandeliers, polished marble floors, and heavy draperies do not exist here. If you want these, choose the St. Regis. The W is simple, sleek, and refreshing from the potted grass near the entrance to the cascading sheet of water in the elevator lobby. Black, white, silver, and grey furnishings would be admittedly dull if not for multicolored mood lighting everywhere in the lobby and large windows that frame the NY skyline. Modest-sized rooms, typical of New York, feel more spacious at this hotel thanks to a mirrored wall behind the bed in each room. As for the &quot;open&quot; shower, mine was actually enclosed by thick glass doors. What sets this hotel apart from many are the youthful amenities in the rooms. My room had a DVD player AND a VHS as well as a cd player with jazz collection. Silver pencils, compact pens, and sticky notes with a &quot;W&quot; punched out could be found on the glass and steel desk. Besides the typical minibar, a full drawer was stocked with everything from a W umbrella and camera to W thongs and a variety of munchies. Perhaps the best thing about this hotel was its &quot;newness&quot; with none of that typical stuffy odor so frequently found at hotels. If you're young, hip, and adventuresome, you'll fall in love with the W. More traditional types will find plenty of other alternatives in NY."
397,1991,"Sep 8 2004	The worst hotel that I stayed at while on business	This hotel is good if you are in NY for a fun weekend and are not planning to spend too much time in your room. However, if you are on business and want a hotel that offers rooms that are comfortable, faily spacious, practical and tastefully decorated to allow you to wind down and relax after a busy day at the office then do not stay at this hotel.The only thing good about this hotel is the very comfortable bed. Everything else is a joke, especially the bathroom.I have stayed at numerous 5-star hotels around the world while on business and this hotel was the worst experience."
398,1991,"Jul 29 2004	This is a great place to stay	I have to say this hotel is great. The staff, location, room, and bar were all excellent. Most of the negative comments I have read from other people on this site are from people being overly picky. I have stayed at great hotels all throughout the world and this one is great. It is not the Four Seasons, but for the price (I paid $164 a night) it is very nice. Once we checked in they gave us a free upgrade to a spectacular room. I highly suggest requesting room 3501 if you want a king size bed. It has a GREAT view of Times Square as well as the Hudson River. The rooms are a great size for NY. I have stayed at the Hudson hotel and those rooms are closets compared to the rooms at the W. The work area is great if you are going for business. Overall, this place lived up to the expectations and I really enjoyed the great service from the staff, however, I would have to say the concierge staff was not up to par with the rest of the staff. The front desk and the gentlemen at the front door are great."
399,1991,"Jul 23 2004	Edgy!!	Not my speed but it was a great experience. My rooms were directly accross from the elevator and I never heard it once. I stayed in both a king and 2 doubles. The rooms were fresh, clean and a very decent size. The plastic desk desk chair is not the most comfortable nor is the upholstered chair, but the beds are terrific. Kudos to the staff, their appearance is that of a typical New Yorker clad in black but they are awesome. The valet parking at first appeared steep, but relative to the area it is worth the few extra dollars for the convenience. Word of caution, in case you didn't know, the electronics stores around times square are scam artists and your best bet is not to go in."
400,1991,"Jul 21 2004	Wish I would have chosen a little more carefully	I brought my mom to NYC for the first time and wanted a hotel that was nice and close to the action. It was definitely close to the action and a great location (all the theaters are right around the corner and the circle line tour bus begins its tour here), but I was not really impressed with that much else.Trendy to say the least. There must have been a rap or def jam award ceremony or concert or something there, because the hotel was full of guys with lots of gold jewelry with their pants down to their knees and lots of pimped out cars and trucks. Not the hotel's fault, but when you go for trendy - be prepared. We went for the &quot;Spectacular&quot; room and both laughed when we saw the room, because we couldn't figure out what was so spectacular! NOT WORTH THE $ for the UPGRADE. There was NO ROOM to even walk around. The breakfast we ordered arrived on a table that wouldn't even fit past the entryway! We had to improvise a place to eat on the bed (one item at a time). There is no place in the bathroom to put anything, so be prepared to get dressed and put on your make-up in the room - somewhere - good luck. The lighting is so dim, and the walls are so dark that its hard to see anything.A few positive things: I can say is that the bedding was incredible. The feather bed, down comfortor and pillows made for a sound, restful sleep. The aveda products in the bathroom are nice. The service was great. I however, would not choose this hotel again. I would go for one of the other W hotels in town....."
401,1991,"Jul 7 2004	Very disappointed.	I have now stayed at three different W hotels, and I must say that I have been repeatedly disappointed. Given what is pictured on their website, I had higher expectations. Of course, it is safe to assume that they feature their nicest rooms online. At this particular W, there were HUGE bubbles of paint pulling away from the wall in the bathroom, I would assume this may be due to not having any sort of fan to rid the closet, posing as a bathroom, of steam. Lets just say that you don't have any privacy, as the bathroom walls are constructed of what seems to be a fogged PVC plastic, and if this is your first travel experience with a boyfriend/girlfriend...well you figure the rest out.And, though rooms are typically small in NYC hotels, this was bigger than most for a deluxe room. I do agree that they didn't use the space very well, in that you don't really have adequate space for a closet or any room to place anything anywhere else in the room because of the bulkiness of the low dresser which holds the tv. I thought the decor was terrible, and bordering on motel. The beds were comfortable as to be expected, however the decorative pillows on the bed were sort of scary, in that they appeared to be badly stained by who knows what. The lobby level was very nice/funky (which I dig); however, the halls are beyond dark, and good luck if you have the slightest vision impairment, black hallways with dim light doesn't mesh well. I must say, however, that the staff service was impeccable."
402,1991,"Jul 7 2004	Not a second time	Upon entering the cascading water walls and ceiling on the ground level &quot;lobby&quot; (reception desk is on the 7th floor), I was excited to see the rest. I was very disappointed. The dark (LOTS of black and gray) lobby, hallways and rooms were gloomy, not &quot;hip&quot;. The shower was terrible! To turn it on, you had to stick your arm in, getting wet before the temp was adjusted and water got all over the outside. Also, not a place to hang a washcloth or hang on when getting in and out (slippery floor). The desk area was non-functional (pencils for writing? why not a pen?) and the drape was very heavy to roll up (actually hurt my hand to do so). Extremely poor lighting. But maybe that was the idea! ? Design doesn't have to replace function; there is room for both. The W didn't combine both. The concierge needed a few lessons in better PR. This W is hung up on being hip..yawn."
403,1991,"Jul 5 2004 	Entry Level Boutique Experience	This hotel does live up to its 4 star rating and the W brand. I would rather stay at the Millennium Broadway Hotel two blocks away and save myself $100/night for a comparable experience. Celebratory things about the hotel include comfortable bed, stylish fixtures, and modern colors and design. The central location is both a curse and a blessing. Most locations were a 20 minute cab ride away and for longer trips, it was easy to take the subway - since all the major subways have stops at Times Square. The drawback however is that times square is beseiged by tourists night and day. Also, if you occupy one of the middle floors and draw your blinds, animated graphics and neon pelt you at every turn. The lobby bar was stylish but uninviting. Room Service was courteous, reliable, and the cuisine was tasty. As other reviewers have noted, the rooms were extremely small - but this is typical of Manhattan hotels. The wireless broadband service was on the fritz when I stayed there last week, though the wired broadband connection in my room worked well."
404,1991,Jun 27 2004	Outdated already	The decor that must have been cool and trendy in the early 90's now seems dated. The W is showing its age. But the bar is still hopping!
405,1991,"Jun 22 2004	A reality check - this is not great	I wanted something special for a stay in NY. I lived in NY for 2 years, and have visited maybe 50 times in the past 15 years or so (staying in most Sheratons, Westins, St-Regis, Best Westerns, Days Hotel, W Hotels, Howard Johnson, Hilton etc). So as a visitor and resident, I think I know NY better than the average bear. The location in Times Sq is good - however it can be TOO close and in-your-face at times. The hotel was expensive, and I expected something special - unfortunately what I got was much, much less. The room was very small (that's not just NY - I expect it there - but for the price I expected a hell of a lot more), and the soundproofing terrible. That is probably my main gripe. The gap under the doors (main and particularly adjoining doors) is large, and allows complete transmission of noise. Imagine you have just flown into NY from Sydney, HK or London, and you want to sleep. Well no way, because each voice, TV channel etc. is so clearly audible that you can join in the conversations. And I mean, you can hear EVERY single word clearly. This includes conversations outside as people wait for the elevator, walk past the room, or the staff use their mobile phones (they mustn't be able to use them elsewhere except when away from managements prying eyes). I did complain - and they were well aware of the door gap / poor materials and noise problems and said that a renovation was overdue. This is a fairly new hotel - just what were they thinking ? Also, the reception area is also a bar - which might as well be Grand Central Station or Times Square inside your lobby. Seriously, there are hundreds (no exaggeration) of noisy drinkers there in the evening all crowded in. You have to shout at the reception staff to be understood. In a nutshell, never again. It may be trendy, but I think W Hotels really take the mickey out of you - charge you heaps and underdeliver. Don't be deceived in thinking you are trendy. By all means visit the bars downstairs at street level, but leave the hotel lobby bar and the hotel itself alone. Very disappointing."
406,1991,"Jun 16 2004	For party-hard Brits	My partner and I enjoyed a short break in NYC over the Easter period and upgraded to a W suite that had jaw-dropping view over the Times Square area.The staff were extremely courteous, particularly the door-men who were also on hand to assist. The rooms weren't exactly pristine but the lobby bar is a fantastic place to relax with drinks. Couldn't fault the Blue Fin restaurant either. However, the concierge service was definitely lacking - especially in a hotel that supposedly prides itself on getting what you want, when you want it. An example being the woefully sparse CD collection - we gave them three choices but none were available.Also, avoid the night club - overcrowded, banal crowd embarassed by the other amazing places in town.Would recommend the W to a young, hip couple who want to party in a central NYC location. Just don't believe ALL the hype."
407,1991,"Jun 3 2004	Wonderful W	My husband and I just returned from our trip to New York City. We stayed at the W Times Square and were pleased to say the least. After reading a few reviews before the trip, I was a little nervous about what to expect. However, we thought the hotel was fabulous. It is definitely set for the younger crowd and very trendy. We especially liked the upbeat dance type music in the elevators. That really helped us wake up in the mornings. The entire staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They were always there to help and answer any questions. The one downfall was the showers. Whatever you did, you couldn't help but have water all over the floor, but it did not affect our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are young and want something different. My husband and I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
408,1991,"Jun 1 2004	W Hotel in Times Square	We stayed at the W Hotel in Times Square in May, 2004. It was fabulous! Very modern, very classy. I picked this hotel because it was in the heart of Times Square and it's location turned out to be excellent. Everything was within walking distance. We had a wonderful time at this hotel and were quite impressed with the cleanliness and stylish decor. The beds were very comfortable. Found plenty of restaurants in the area that were pricedright. Would highly recommend this hotel for those looking for a luxury hotel that's in the middle of all the action. Noise was not a problem. Pick a higher floor. Bathroom had a tub, not a shower so the floor getting wet was not a problem."
409,1991,"May 23 2004	great location okay hotel	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights beginning May 14/04. We chose it because of the location (across the street from TKTS, and near lots of theatres). The decor is certainly different than typical hotels.My husband enjoyed the &quot;funkiness&quot; but I was less impressed. The room they initially gave us was very noisy, so they moved us to a higher floor (44th, an accessible room) which was better.The furniture needed painting and the bathroom had nocounter to put anything on. The sink even had nowhere toput the soap, so it kept falling into the sink! Don't they think of these things? The room was a bit dark. The service was okay, but the concierge we asked for help was not overly helpful. Overall I was not impressed. We also stayed at the Westin Essex House for 3 nights for only slightly more money and it was much more luxurious."
410,1991,"May 12 2004	A different type of hotel	A friend and I stayed at this property in December. The bed was simply heaven! However, I would of prefered a bathroom with some room to store my personal belongings. The shower had no door therefore water ended up all over the floor. Was quite uncomfortable as the &quot;frost glass divider&quot; and not a wall divided the bathroom from the bedroom area. Hey, I am used to my privacy without anyone having to see my silhouette as I utilize the restroom. We ordered room service which was quite expensive, but it was a nice change. Overall it was clean, but did not like the black walls throughout the entire hotel. It as though they went so high tech that they forgot about convenience."
411,1991,"Apr 22 2004	Funky hotel!	We were moved to this hotel for our first night as our original hotel was over booked. I loved the grey room, the black corridors, the entrance lobby is fab. We stayed on the 33rd floor. I found the staff to be great. Their whatever wherever service is good. We had a problem with our safety deposit box, within minutes the security guys were up taking a look at it and replaced it for us. We were also able to check out before leaving our room over the TV system. I was sad to leave the hotel, great location, a little noisy from street noise but it is Times Square, you can hardly expect it to be quiet!! I would definately stay there again, what a great funky, young hotel!!"
412,1991,"Apr 20 2004	Depressing and creepy... What happened W???	Being on the road 6 months out of the year, I am an avid W fan. I used a free night for a special occasion at the W Times Square, and was puzzled, to say the least. It was as if the designer had taken all the things I love about W hotels (sleek but comfortable, lush and inviting) and thought up ways to use the same style concept to achieve the opposite. The narrow hallways were painted completely BLACK, if you can believe it. The color scheme in the room was all grey, with warehouse-type metal doors, etc. &quot;Depressing&quot; doesn't do it justice. The bathroom and desk area were extraordinarily poorly designed, going for a futuristic look rather than conveniency. (No bathroom counter, no shower door, grey plastic desk chair, etc.) It was a horrible experience, but worth it just to see the unbelievably stupid design decisions. With other, gorgeous, W hotels in the area, skip this one."
413,1991,Feb 22 2004	Nice hotel hectic location need some touch ups	My husband &amp; I travel to NYC several times a year for fun. Each time we have stayed somewhere different. We stayed at the W Times Square over Thanksgiving in 2003 since we wanted to be near the parade route. We booked a wonderful room and thought it was extremely spacious for a NY hotel. The Blue Fin bar was nice but the drinks were expensive. We went there once just for the atmosphere. It was nice not to have the lobby on the ground floor since the Times Square is so hectic. It is a great location if you plan to see some broadway shows. I loved the hotel but would not stay there again just b/c of the location. It is way too chaotic.
414,1991,"Feb 19 2004	Fun for short stay	We stayed here for a weekend last May. The rooms were nice, the bedding was heaven! Although the modern design of the bathroom didn't account for the fact that you might actually want to use the shower! The water went everywhere. The Lobby club was fun and drew a good crowd. However, the club music pumped into the elevator was a little much the next morning. The Resturant the Blue Fin was a little dissapointing, I had a large chunk of egg shell with my breakfast. Overall it was fun for a short stay."
415,1991,Feb 16 2004	Good feel - awful service	I stayed here for a month on business: Pros- modern relaxed feel/Good bar and restaurant Cons- the service is quite awful for the prices charged. The unknowledgable staff think they are so cool they come across as just unhelpful/bordering rude. Tiny Gym. Check your Room bill/Amex bill carefully.
416,1991,"Jan 7 2004	Above Average NYC Hotel	My boyfriend and I spent a night at the W Times Square around New Years. Having had some not-so-great experiences at other Manhattan hotels the W was a very nice surprise. This hotel is very chic and hip from its decor to its guests. The automatic checkin is a plus and the front desk staff is equally as helpful. The rooms are larger than many other NYC hotels and are very nicely decorated. We had a very comfortable king size bed with exceptional sheets and duvet. The bathroom is also spacious with a nice shower and is stocked with Aveeda toiletries. There is a snack and mini bar, tv/vcr/dvd, cable with HBO, internet connection...you feel well taken care of. I would, however, stay away from Blue Fin Restaurant which is located within the hotel - the food was bland and the service was terrible - there are much better food choices in the area."
417,1991,"Dec 22 2003	A Most Pleasant Experience!	I cannot sing the praises of the W Times Square enough! Upon arrival, I was greeted by the friendly and helpful &quot;bell hop&quot; Charles. He led me to check-in through the W's beautiful reception area on the 7th floor, where my check-in was completed quickly! I had originally been given a room with only one king bed, but the gentleman at reception managed to find me a room with two double beds; definitely much more condusive to my needs (I had my 6 year old daughter with me). While the room was small, the beds were comfortable, the bathroom clean and roomy, and the amenities fulfilling. The wherever/whenever staff was extremely helpful, and the likes of Jose, John, Frankie, Joe, and the rest of the W crew made me feel as though the W was my home! The staff even began to greet me by my name! Also, the location of the W made it ideal for my needs. Only 3 blocks up and 4 blocks over was Rockefeller Center, and as for Madison Ave., it was a short taxi ride away (and either Jose or Joe was there to hail me a cab :-) ) My stay at the W was a perfect experience, and it will be one I will never forget!"
418,1991,"Dec 17 2003	Liked it Did not Love it!	We stayed in the W hotel Dec. 13-16. We were on the 22nd floor and had a beautiful view of Times Square. The location was ideal for the theater and evening dinners. Upon arriving, our room was freezing. Maintanence was prompt in fixing the problem. The room is rather small, that was to be expected. Our king size bed was the ultimate, and what I expect from the Westin chain. What I really was unhappy about was that I could hear in perfect detail the conversations of the people in the room next door. We had a connneting door in our room, so that could have been a reason for the noise. I know they could also hear me. They were not loud, just the room had no noise control. The shower was a walk in with a glass wall that did not cover but about half of the opening. Water goes out of the opening no matter how careful you are and you never can really get warm taking your shower. The Blue Fin restaurant was pricey, and good, but not as good as the reviews were. The staff was good, the bar was cool. The hotel is very dark, (the hallways are black) and very modern. I think it was my least favorite Westin hotel that I had stayed in and the most expensive. So , like I said, I didn't love it, nor did I hate it!"
419,1991,"Oct 20 2003	W Hotel--A very good hotel	We visited NYC in mid-Oct. and stayed at the W Hotel in Times Square and the Fitzpatrick Hotel at Grand Central Station (E 44th &amp; Lexington). Both hotels were very clean, the rooms were adequate size for 2 adults, and the beds were very comfortable. The W Hotel is located right in the center of the theater district which is very convenient but you will get the noise fron taxi cab horns, traffic, etc. The Fitzpatrick is located just steps from Grand Central Station which allows you to catch a subway to anywhere. The W Hotel has very dark hallways and the rooms are decorated in an ultra-modern way with only a shower in the bathroom. Also, we were on the 25th floor and the closest ice machine I could find (on the way down) that was working was on the 21st floor. The Fitzpatrick did not have a chest to store clothes but did have adequate shelves in the closet and the bottom half of the entertainment center. If you don't mind riding the subway (which we used extensively with absolutely no problems at all) the Fitzgerald is a much better value. I would also recommend getting a NYC Pass on the internet and use a Mastercard to get a 3 Day Pass at the 2 Day price ($69) if it is still available. The pass gives you free access to virtually everything you would want to see and do and allows you to avoid long lines at many of the attractions. You also get a Metrocard pass for unlimited bus and subway travel. We picked up our NYC Pass at Madame Tussaud's at 42nd &amp; 8th Avenue. Another way to save money in NYC is to purchase A NYC Entertainment card and book for $25. We more than paid for the book with the savings we enjoyed on excellent meals at Broadway Joe's Steak House and DaMarino's Italian Restaurant, both in the theatre district. We also tried to use the card at Mustang Sally's but they said they did not honor it even though they were listed in the Entertainment book. We really enjoyed our trip to NYC. The W Hotel and the Fitzpatrick at GCS are great places to stay and virtually everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful."
420,1991,"Oct 13 2003	Nice but didn't blow me away	My wife and I went to NYC to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, and we wanted to stay near Times Sq. to be &quot;at the center of it all.&quot; If that is what you desire, you won't be disappointed by the location of this hotel--it is quite literally a 20-second walk to the center of all the action!The hotel is, as advertised, quite chic and modern. We found the room--a &quot;spectacular&quot; room on the 52nd floor--to be comfortable and well-appointed, though by no means spacious. I'd read much about how small are NYC hotel rooms, so the room actually exceeded my expectations, though the bathroom was especially tight. King bedrooms come with only a shower stall (no tub). Our &quot;spectacular&quot; view turned out to be dominated by the Marriott Marquis across the street, though by craning our necks we could see a bit of Times Sq. I was surprised by the condition of the hotel--although it is only a couple of years old, it is already showing signs of wear. There were quite a few scuffs on the walls in our room, and the chair had a big stain right in the middle of the seat cushion (eeeeww--what was THAT, we wondered?). The hotel just doesn't seem built to last, which may indicate that they plan frequent renovations (the overall concept of this hotel chain is questionable--what is chic and trendy today will look dated in 3 years).The biggest disappointment was the lobby/ bar area, which we did not find inviting at the least. It was dimly lit, had a fairly low ceiling, and to our taste looked rather dreary. It was frequently filled with a very loud crowd of twenty- and thirty-somethings, and the acoustics of the place left much to be desired (not at all &quot;Zen-like,&quot; as the marketing propaganda states). Just off the lobby, there are three sets of elevators servicing various levels in the hotel, and the passages back to the elevators were ridiculously narrow. We got clipped by people and/or baggage carts nearly every time we walked to or from the elevator.The staff was competent and friendly, though I don't think anyone was over 30. They all wear black, and mostly look like aspiring actor/model wannabees. That they refer to themselves not as &quot;staff,&quot; but as &quot;cast members&quot; gives a clue!Overall, though, we enjoyed our stay. If you wish to stay near Times Sq., this is a good bet. Just make sure you know what you're in for--there's lots of action in the area, but with that action comes noise and huge crowds, day and night. We could hear quite a bit of noise up on the 52nd floor--I can't imagine what it would be like on a lower floor! We also found that hailing a taxi outside the hotel took a while, up to 15-20 minutes at the busiest times of the day. If you are rushing out to make a dinner reservation, you will need to take this into account."
421,1991,"Oct 8 2003	Amazing Service to top off great rooms and location!	Let me start by saying I got an amazing price here (under $200) by booking on line directly with the hotel 2 months in advance and using their AAA rate. Because my rate was so low I wondered if my room would also be low (I had requested a high floor) and when I checked in I discovered I had been placed on the 17th floor with a limited view. The room itself was very well appointed and extremely comfortable and quiet but I was hoping for a better view. I phoned the welcome desk and asked if there was anything else available and they said not that night there wasn't, but they promised to check for me the next day (I was staying for 7 nights). I didn't expect much to happen but the next day I was moved up to the 31st floor with a stunning view of Times Square, they had not forgotten about me and went out of their way to make sure I had the room I wanted, bravo. The service every step of the way was excellent, including the whenever/whatever service (on the day I left I phoned this service to ask if they had anything I could wrap some framed pictures in that I had bought and within 5 minutes someone was at my door with a box of bubble wrap)! The room was spotlessly clean, very quiet for Times Square (and very large as well for the location) and full of great amenities. The bathrobes were the most comfortable I have ever worn so I ended up buying one. I have stayed in a lot of different NYC hotels but I have found my new home away from home with the W Times Square. For those other reviewers that may have had concerns I wonder if they brought them to the attention of the staff because I am sure they would have recieved the same positive experience I did if they had."
422,1991,"Oct 4 2003	Best 6 nights in NYC!!	I have several different hotels in NYC as a tourist, but this has been the best experience yet. Not only is the hotel ideally located right in the middle of Times Square, the beds, decor, and staff were great all great!! One staff member helped me clear up a problem w/my reservation, and for all my trouble they upgraded us to a high floor room. I will definitely not stay anywhere else next time I visit. The Blue Fin restaurant downstairs is also a great for breakfast!"

1,1994,"Oct 28 2009 	Good value	Nice little hotel in a great location. Not 5* but then you're not paying 5* rates. Clean, friendly staff and an easy 5 minute walk to Union Square."
2,1994,"Oct 25 2009 	Good location but cramped and unclean	We stayed in the Adante for two nights when we arrived in SF and again for one night the following week before we left. The hotel is ideally situated only a short walk from Union Square and the front desk staff were helpful. We were allowed to check-in early and were even on our first visit given a larger room (501) than we had booked. The following week we had a normal 2-double room (604) and honestly it was the smallest room we have ever stayed in. We could barely fit our luggage in with the stroller and porta-cot! The first thing you notice when you enter this hotel is that it is old and very cramped. It is impossible to get more than two people with luggage into the elevator and the stairs are very narrow. We made the mistake of returning to the hotel one afternoon around 5pm when a busload of people had arrived to check-in. There was a queue for the elevator for 15 minutes, which was a little annoying.The room we first stayed in, despite being larger than normal (but still small except for the large bathroom), was very unclean. The floor was sticky and we felt dirty if we did not wear shoes. Even worse our 1 year old was crawling around on it - yuk. As for safety with a child: it was lacking. We were on the fifth floor and if we did not close the window our kids could have just fallen straight out to the ground below as there were no flyscreens. The TV did not receive very many channels and on neither occasion we stayed did the promised free wireless internet work. The front desk provided a cable to use the ADSL connection but it did not work either. Unfortunately also the breakfast was served in the lobby due to construction work, making it a cramped experience also and really there was not much food on offer other than a muffin or toast. All up though, the price was decent and in any city in the world you get what you pay for at the budget end of the market - it just surprised us how poor this place was in relation to its description and photos on its website."
3,1994,"Oct 20 2009 	Cute Boutique Hotel	Stayed here with friends for the SF Marathon. LOVED IT! We got the king junior suite that gave us a separate living room with a pull out sofa bed. I loved the wall paintings! Room was very clean and staff was nice and respectful. The only small complaint was the view: we had none! Also, I had to pay about $20 for parking but that is standard in SF--at least they provided parking! Great budget hotel for the frugal traveler."
4,1994,"Oct 19 2009 	Great location...	...just 3 or 4 blocks from Union Sq, and Powell St BART is definitely in walking distance"
5,1994,"Oct 19 2009 	Disgusting!	I would be the Canadian women referred to in the previous review. This was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. The first night we stayed in a king suite on the second floor. It was extremely filthy. The rug was so dirty that we didn't feel comfortable in bare feet. The couch was dirty and sagged in the middle. Although we had two windows they didn't allow in any light in as they looked out onto a narrow space between buildings that was littered with cigarette buts, pigeon poop and garbage. We were aghast. They wanted to charge us $179 the first night and $199 the second. The nerve! When we complained and said we would not stay in the room another night and that we wanted a reduced rate they moved us to a double room on the fifth floor. They said the rate for that room was $199 but they would give it to us for $149. They refused to reduce the previous nights rate because they had closed their books for that day?! We did not take advantage of the continental breakfast because it looked totally unappetizing . if you like cheap store bought muffins or white doughy bread you might disagree. Anyway do not stay here. It is disgusting.The only good thing about the hotel was the desk staff Patient. The management should be ashamed of themselves. I just reviewed the hotel website and they describe their hotel as clean. Very far from the truth."
6,1994,"Oct 17 2009 	Beware of the bed bugs!!!!!	Beware of room 612, after 7 nightsmyself and my partner left with hundreds of nasty bed bug bites (WHICH ARE STILL VISIBLE MORE THAN A MONTH LATER!!).Also heard one customer complaining of mould around her shower and she wasn't able to change rooms. As we were checking out another couple were trying to check in with an expedia reservation but the hotel had no record of this and was full. Nightmare. Didnt see the outcome but did not look good. Suppose this could have been an error with expedia or the hotel.Pros - free internet, decent location, cheap.Cons - No proper air conditioning in rooms, very bad decor, shower designed for people under 4 foot, sticky carpets, BED BUGS."
7,1994,"Oct 14 2009 	Avoid - unless you can get a very very very good prize	we paid 160 ,- thorugh hotwire for a two star hotel with good location. The location is good. The hotel terrible. The room was a closet which looked like a flamingo with a love for Trinidad had exploded in it ( you will understand if you ever see it), queenseize  bed, holes in blankets and furniture, its view was a brickwall, no ac, a fan in the loft. It was ok clean but so depressing I felt like crying. Unfortunately it was late, we had our ten month old baby with us - so we stayed. The very sternlooking chinese man in the frontdesk ( manager I think) told us they hadn't a baby crip and declined our wish for room with a king bed, so it could fit the three of us.The breakfast next morning was as depressing as the room. The only uplifting thing was to canadian women who complained over the bird droppings and the dirty carpet in their room and got a discount ( 140 ,- instead of 199,-).If it had costed 70,- it would be all right - the canadian women called the hotel ' a scam'.Poor woman this morning working the front desk and looking at all those discontent guests. We fled this morning. Staying at Cova down the road now - great place! Same price. I have written hotwire and asked them to remove a star from the hotelrating. If it had one star and costed 70 bucks it would be an ok solution for young travellers. Ohhh yeah ...the internet worked fine."
8,1994,"Oct 14 2009 	Don't stay there	The service was non-existent, the breakfast was a joke. There were hardly any seats in the lobby which doubled as a breakfast room and everyone stood around looking ill at ease wondering what to do. There was supposed to be a restaurant opening next door but we never saw any evidence of building work going on. Our room was stifling hot, and the carpet was sticky to walk on. When we checked out, the girl at the desk talked to someone on her mobile phone as she was serving us. It was awful. The only plus is the good location near to Union Square. Next time we will definitely pay more money to stay somewhere better."
9,1994,"Oct 13 2009 	Stay was very unpleasant	When we booked online we requested 2 single beds, this was completely ignored and there was no apology given. Room decor was shocking. The bedding had cigarette burns. Room was hot &amp; stuffy with no air con. Windows had no fly screens. Wireless internet was hopeless most of the time. Unable to watch the news due to the fact the television cut out due to 'energy saving'. Advertised as Continental Breakfast included. this was a joke. You were required to cook your own toast in the foyer and there was nowhere to sit down to eat it. Hotel had one small lift for over 70 rooms. We were on the 6th floor and most times we used the stairs. Would never never use this hotel again"
10,1994,Sep 28 2009 	I can't recommend it for couples or single females.	I had a king suite at a great rate and it was a large room. It was just a little dingy feeling with sub-premium linens. I was very dissappointed when I walked in but got use to it. Sort of like that Motel 6 feeling. The bathroom was very clean but the furniture was not. The sofa and chairs had stains on them. I had to open the windows at night for cooling but that made the room noisy. I will not stay there again unless I am travelling by myself and can get a very good deal on it. It is a decent location but there are hotels on every corner that look from the outside to be better.
11,1994,"Sep 22 2009 	Very good value for money for a short stay	The location of the hotel is very good - a few blocks from Union square, with lots of public transportation options nearby. There are a few homeless guys around, and it's better not to go too far down on Geary street, but the hotel itself is still in a safe area.The price is very good for such a location, and if you want to save the money for better things than a fancy room to sleep in, this is a good option.Obviously, this is not a 5-star hotel. No AC, the carpets seem and feel way too old, and in our specific room we had to figure out how to open water in the shower without tearing the tap off the wall. On the other hand, the bed was a delight, the room was painted nicely, and it was very quiet - a very important issue in the city center.And they provide a computer with free internet in the lobby. Overall, it was a very pleasant and affordable stay."
12,1994,"Sep 18 2009 	Do not stay here	Homeless people right outside the door. Breakfast is toast and jam. Muffins and fruit promised. Room very hot. No screens on the windows so you can not open them without bugs flying in. Tiles on bathroom floor popping out. Bedspreads, blankets, curtains and sheets all had holes or burn marks. Promised internet in the rooms but we could not get any service."
13,1994,"Sep 3 2009 	Pretty good for the price	The room was clean and nice, but it was a little bit noisy. It's not very big, but it's nice if just sleep there. The guys at the reception were helpful. The breakfast was a dissapointment. They said there's going to be muffins and fruits and everything, but instead there were only toasts and jam. It was kind of boring after 5 mornings... The location is pretty good. The cable car line is close to it and u can also walk to attractions. There is a bus stop just in front of the hotel.But it's right on the edge of the good area.If u turn to the right from the hotel it kind of gets creepy and u just simply don't wan't to walk further."
14,1994,"Aug 9 2009 	Great little hotel	Excellent location -- walking distance to Union Square. On the whole the staff were friendly and helpful. We were well looked after. While the rooms are small they were more than adequate. It was very reasonably priced. The next time we visit San Francisco,we will be staying at the Adante"
15,1994,"Aug 4 2009 	Cheap and cheerful	Rooms small but adequate with own bathroom. Hotel is a bit old but clean and comfortable. Well located for the trams and centre. At $70 a night in mid July, a bargain."
16,1994,"Jul 22 2009 	not worth the price	The good point is the proximity to Union Square if that is important to you.The rooms are clean enough but small and ugly. No air-conditioning, the view from the rooms not on the street side is depressing. The three days I was there, there was never any butter for breakfast, and muffins were sometimes missing.I asked for a reservation for a door-to-door van to the airport which I paid for but the reception never made the call so I almost missed my flight.No great memories from this hotel. For 95 $ a night, put another 20 and you'll get much more"
17,1994,"Jun 28 2009 	Not Good!	The tiniest, most mediocre room I've ever stayed in. After an hour of serving breakfast, they ran out of muffins and orange juice with still one hour to go on their breakfast time. Carpet is disgusting. Cheap room, but would rather stay in a better hotel closer to Union Square."
18,1994,"Jun 19 2009 	Perfect site...	I am tired out of paying for things I dont need. This is the reason why I am so happy I chose Adante hotel. This hotel gave me everything I needed but superfluous stuff. It has no luxury but it is very comfortable. It has no employees who open the car door but has a nice staff who takes good care of their guests. In the up scale hotels the amenities come out in the bill, at the Premiere all the services are for free. Its location is unbeatable (a few steps from the Union Square, Bart, Macys, etc), its rooms are spotless and its price is not expensive. A detail good breakfast toast, mermelade, butter, juices, Internet in your room high speed, flat rate $5 one, two or five days."
19,1994,"May 18 2009 	Very Good Value And Location	This hotel offers a cheap option in a central location just off Union Square. The staff were freindly and very helpful, the rooms were small but clean and the bed comfortable. The complimentary breakfast of juice, coffee, toast, and muffins was adequte rather than paying 10 dollars each morning. I was wary because of the price i paid but had no complaints and wouldnt hesitate to stay here again. I only encountered a couple of homeless people near the hotel most seemed to be on Powell Street and were no problem at all."
20,1994,"May 13 2009 	Central and cheap	Room was small but clean and comfortable. It was also very quiet and the staff were helpful. Breakfast was a bit ordinary. We were a bit shocked when we first arrived as this hotel was booked by our travel agent, however, it served the purpose."
21,1994,"Mar 7 2009 	Affordable and great location in San Fran	I booked this hotel for my recent 3 night stay in San Fran on the recommendation of my travel agent. I went directly to their website to book and was surprised at the affordable rates they were offering. Also, as I booked more than two nights, I received a further 15% discount, which was great. I also booked an airport pick up and return through their recommended airport shuttle service provider (Lorries)... however you can get cheaper services... so shop around. Even if you pre book a collection, be sure to pick up a brochure or 'What's On' pamphlet in San Fran and they will have heaps of services listed with discount coupons saving you up to $5US per ride. Unfortunately I booked and paid a deposit for the return before realising that there were cheaper shuttle services.The hotel is really central, I walked to Union Square each day, down to Market St (and caught public transport round to Fishermans Wharf) and caught buses and cable cars everywhere else I needed to go and there were stops so close to the hotel. There are a lot of mini marts, internet and restaurants close by (ie two - three shops away).Breakfast is included, but it is only tea and coffee, blueberry and chocolate muffins, and toast / bread with butter and jam. I actually liked the arrangement though because I don't eat breakfast but was able to make a sandwich and take a muffin to eat later on in the day. There is also a coffee dripolater in the room which is handy. One of the staff, a really nice girl by the name of Leila (or similar), was extremely friendly and helpful and gave me all the infromation and directions I needed to go to Petaluma (2 hours bus ride north) to Premium Outlet Shopping. She also advised which areas to stay away from at night as they can be unsafe for single female travellers.The rooms themselves and the corridors and even the reception area have painted murals on the walls and this gives the hotel so much character... it really is charming. I stayed in room 712 and whilst I didn't have a view or anything the room was excellent with a queen size bed and separate bathroom with bath over shower. My TV wasn't runed in though... I suppose I could've called reception to fix it... but I don't watch TV much so it didn't really matter! I would recommend this hotel and the price was really affordable."
22,1994,"Feb 8 2009 	Stay Away from this hotel!!!	It was a nightmare,terrible,nothing good about it but a scam,stay away if you could!!!"
23,1994,"Jan 22 2009 	cold and smelly	walked in and there was no heat, the linens had holes in them and my room smelled like toilet cleaner. they couldnt fix the heat because they didnt know how and there was only one person on site to help. this place was worse than a 10 dollar hostel in guatemala, by far. they brought some &quot;blankets&quot; that were stained sheets of foam to help with the very cold night. was originally booked for 7 days but left after one. if you are a backpacking teenager you may be able to tolerate a couple of nights here but for a few dollars more you can prob have a clean warm room nearby."
24,1994,"Dec 14 2008 	Decent place with affordable prices	I not going to add to much in the previous reviews.This hotel is well located, the rooms are little bit smal, but well, and they offer free &quot;breakfast&quot; (in fact bread, coffe and juice).Staff is also nice, but not outstanding.The price is OK and if want to visit San Francisco without spending a lot of money, staying in a simple and honest hotel this is a great deal."
25,1994,"Nov 27 2008 	A fair deal	For $50 a day in San Francisco, it's not bad. The place was clean. Do yourself a favor though: Ask for a high-floor room that faces the street. We were put in a room in the back, and the building right across (less than 15 feet) had jackasses that were partying all night. The people at the hotel though were very kind in moving us to another room. Also, on my first night there, the heat didn't work. Luckily it was a mild summer night, so it didn't matter too much, and again the people solved the problem and the next night the old-fashioned steam radiator was working. It's walking distance from a lot of cool San Francisco, so if you're just looking for a cool getaway, you should stay here."
26,1994,"Nov 19 2008 	A Great Value - and Fantastic Location!	The Adante was ideal for what we needed: decent, clean hotel in centrally located. While the room was modest, it was spotless and certainly bigger than I expected for a twin room. The included continental breakfast is very bare-bones: toast, english muffins, coffee, tea and juice (but not orange). Then again, it's included, so we were grateful to save a few extra bucks each morning. We were in San Francisco during an record-breaking heatwave, so the fact there wasn't air conditioning DID prove challenging. In fact, we asked to be moved from the top floor (7) to a lower floor (4) and it was much cooler. There are ceiling fans in each room. The only real downside was that the hotel seems to have a bit of a youth-hostel vibe: Each night it seemed, partying 20-somethings blasted their boomboxes with their windows and/or doors propped open. We called once to the front desk to ask if they could keep it down, and they quickly addressed the issue. So - all in all - a great stay, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a clean hotel in a great location -- only 5 minute walk to Union Square. We were very pleased overall! :)"
27,1994,"Nov 19 2008 	Perfectly located!	It's near great affordable hole-in-the-wall restaurants (Dottie's, Shalimar, Chutney), 3 blocks from the cable car, 7 blocks from BART, and buses running past the hotel or a main line 7 blocks away.It's right on the edge of a rundown section of town (Tenderloin) but the street charm is great and the main streets (Geary and Jones) are bustling all the time. You'll find some homeless folks and seediness on side streets but the area is completely safe.The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was adequate--juice, coffee, english muffin, white bread toast, and jam.We hit a warm spell, in November if you can believe it, and so our room was warm with no A/C. However, by keeping the window open and the fan on during the day and evening it was a reasonable temperature. I don't know what it would be like in the summer. Our king bed room (602) with jacuzzi faced the street and there was noise but with the window closed at night we were able to sleep through it. We always take earplugs with us when we travel, though, just in case. It cost us $86 per night (including tax) and we would stay there again if we returned to S.F."
28,1994,"Sep 30 2008	Exceptional Value!	Adante hotel is located a few blocks from the Union Square on Geary Street. It is a clean hotel and at $71 per night it was a great value! The rooms are clean and a good size, the staff are very courteous and professional, the location is the key. One thing I was confused about the the hotel's theme - it has an Italian/mediterranean theme but the room have tropical frescos in it. Another thing is the pillows - they were not great but then we found extra pillow in the drawers. We were very happy with our experience there and will stay there again."
29,1994,"Sep 22 2008 	Great location clean and cheap!	We got a great deal for this hotel through Expedia and as we only planned to use it as somewhere to sleep, a luxury hotel wasn't high on our list of priorities. The rooms were clean, if a little dated. Bed was comfortable with clean sheets, blankets etc. All the basic facilities were there (TV, coffee maker, iron etc). Bathroom was spotless and room was cleaned every day.The free breakfast was toast, muffins, coffee &amp; juice- but if you want something more substantial there are plenty of reasonably priced places nearby.Overall a great hotel with a brilliant location- i'm sure it's very hard to beat for the price."
30,1994,"Aug 31 2008 	Great Price and Service Marginal Location	The front desk staff could not have been more helpful and the queen suite room was large and comfortable. Overall, I found it to be good value, but there were a couple of concerns:1. I had bought the valet parking package. The check in time starts at 3pm and I arrived at about 3:40pm. The waiting area for valet parking is an area where there is no standing allowed between 4pm-6pm. I was a solo traveler and it was a struggle to try to check in and watch the car in the 30 minute wait for the one valet parking person to get to my car, with the fear of being towed.2. It's a only a 5 minute walk to Union Square, but it's in a borderline neighborhood (massage parlors, etc.), and I would not recommend it for nervous or inexperienced travelers.Overall, I would stay here again and recommend it to seasoned, budget minded travelers."
31,1994,Aug 30 2008 	good and clean hotel	this a cheap and very clean hotel in san francisco downtown. excellent position.we stayed here for 3 nigths and was a very good deal.The breakfast in simple but remember that the hotel is cheap!I advice this accomodation.
32,1994,"Aug 28 2008 	Don't go there ...	This Hotel is expensive, old, and sometimes dirty. The worst is Breakfast : you're in the lobby, almost no chair, no table, 1 coffee machine, a few slices of bread, a few muffins, and that's it. People in the streets around are rather strange (many homeless, mad people, bad looking guys, ...). If you use the valet service for your car, wait at least 15 minutes though the cark park is only 300 feet off the hotel. In fact : don't go there."
33,1994,"Aug 16 2008 	Charged me for 3 nights I only stayed 2 nights!! BAD customer service.	I booked this hotel for 2 nights through a $99 a night special they were offering. When I got to the hotel, I verified the price and the nights of stay. When I checked out after the 2nd night, they told me that I was booked for 3 nights at $99/night. I told them that I verified this when I checked in. They told me to call the manager to work out the situation. When I called the manager, he said he would look into it an call me back; he never did call me back. When I got the bill on my credit card, they did only charge me for 2 nights, but they charged me $155/ night! The same price I would have paid if I stayed there 3 nights!"
34,1994,"Jul 16 2008 	Will stay here every time I visit the city	We have stayed at the Adante at least 8 times. I LOVE this hotel. It's cute and quirky in a way that works just right in The City. Each room has a different theme painted on the walls. We have stayed in ocean, jungle and garden themed rooms. Upgrade to the Jacuzzi suite. The one on the 6th floor is my favorite. The tub is a bit tricky so ask for instructions at the desk.If you walk out of the hotel and head toward Union Square there is a FANTASTIC dive bar, total total dive bar, I think it's called the High Tide, on the corner. The ladies that run it are great and the tiny tables are funny if not practical. Also, crew from the local theater hand out there after the show, we hung out with the crew from Jersey Boys a few years ago there.We have stayed at different hotels in the city but always end up wishing we had stayed at the Adante."
35,1994,"Jul 15 2008 	Liked the Adante	We stayed 3 nights at the Adante and found it to be fine for our trip.The room was clean and had everything we needed. The free breakfast was exactly as it says on the website - juice, toast and muffins.It was easy to get to the Powell Street BART and to Union Square.Yes there are homeless people about on Geary Street but they didn't bother us. If they asked for money and we said no they thanked us anyway and told us to have a nice day."
36,1994,"Jul 15 2008 	Downhill for fast	I have stayed at the Adante 3 or 4 times previously for periods between 1 night and 10 nights, and think I actually wrote a positive review about it a few years ago.I would now sadly have to retract that.I recently spent one night at the Adante, and it was one night too many.The quality of the hotel has gone way down, and upon entering the tiny, steaming hot, 1 bedroom room, with rock hard beds, threadbare sheets and a dripping shower, I was very glad I was only staying one night.Normally my hotel room isn't particularly important as I spend so little time there, but at the same time it's nice to come back to a comfortable room to relax. The Adante no longer offers that, and I won't be staying there again.You can easily find comparatively priced accomodation in downtown San Francisco, and I recommend avoiding the Adante."
37,1994,"Jul 13 2008 	good quiet easy located hotel	excellent location, room had everything i wanted, bath/safe.except no kettle, only coffee maker, but not a big problem.room was quietly located. Initially i had booked this hotel for only 1 week, just in case i didn't like it, but because i was happy with room and location i decided to book another week and i didn't have to change room!The Bed was very comfortable and had big TV. Room generally very clean.Staff pretty good, except on two occasions i managed to change travelers cheques, on the third another receptionist said they weren't allowed to, which is strange as the other receptionist did, especially as i thought travellerscheques were widely accepted in USAThere is an internet cafe right next door, which is also connected through the hotels reception.Hotel is centrally located only about less than 10 mins walk to Powell Street Bart and cable cars. there are plenty of cafe's etc on the hotels road.Although there are a few homeless people about they really do not bother you, otherwise you can get an no.38 bus right on the road."
38,1994,Jun 29 2008 	Good stay at the Adante	We booked our stay at the Adante Hotel via their website after reading the reviews on trip advisor and were not disappointed. The room was small but adequate and we were thankful to have our own bathroom which seems to be a luxury in a boutique or budge hotel in San Francisco. The hotel is located only a couple of blocks away from Union Square which is an easy walk. We also had little trouble making our way on foot from the Hotel to the BART station at Powel Street to travel to the airport when leaving San Francisco. We found the staff at reception friendly and helpful. There is also a cafe attached to the hotel that does real coffee. All in all we had a good stay at the Adante Hotel and would recommend it to others. The only thing I would suggest is that you ask for a room toward the rear of the hotel as our room was at the front of the hotel on the street and was a little noisy but we slept ok.
39,1994,"Jun 12 2008 	Good value but don't expect the Ritz	The Adante Hotel was fine for my needs. I basically just needed a place to sleep after being out all day sightseeing. If you are looking for a resort or extras then the Adante is not for you. The people who have written reviews here saying &quot;There was no fitness center!&quot; or &quot;There was no bar!&quot; have only themselves to blame. Nowhere on the Adante website or any other website where you can book a room there does it say it has these things. If you want those things then stay somewhere else! Yes, there are homeless people in the neighborhood, but guess what - they are also outside 5 star $500 a night hotels right down the street. It's a big city, there are homeless people, deal with it or take a vacation in the mountains in the middle of nowhere, where instead of a homeless person asking you for change, a bear will ask you to get in its belly.People should also not complain about the free breakfast. It was FREE, if you don't like it go spend actual money in a restaurant on it, don't forget the tip. The breakfast was fine. I had buttered toast that you make yourself so its nice and hot. Plus I had all the orange juice I could drink. They also have coffee, tea, and muffins.Another complaint people had in reviews: the rooms have no A/C. Well guess what? Most hotels, and even homes, in San Francisco don't have A/C. It never gets hot enough for it. You can open your window in your room and there is also a ceiling fan. If you are out sightseeing during the day you won't even be there at the warmest part of the day. At night it gets very cool on San Francisco. My window faced a wall, no big deal, I didn't book the hotel for a view. Since I was on the side I heard no street noise even with my window wide open, except for sirens, which you could probably hear even with your windows shut. The bathroom was very big, almost as big as the room, and very nice. I was on a floor with an ice machine so that was never a problem. I liked the painted murals. There is free high speed internet access in the rooms, and also an internet cafe connected to the hotel.The hotel is only a few blocks from Union Square - the heart of San Francisco and access point for cable cars, Bart, MUNI, etc. There is also a bus that stops right in front of the hotel, the #38 bus, that will take you to Ocean Beach. That is the wide, sandy beach they have there. Some advice for public transportation: Buy a MUNI Passport. Only $24 for 7 days of unlimited cable car, street car, and bus rides. Quite worth it since cable car rides alone are $5 each way. Overall the Adante is a good value for your money, putting you near the heart of San Francisco while not breaking your budget."
40,1994,"May 21 2008 	Nice place to stay	Just came back from a weekend at the Adante. The location was pretty good, about 3-4 blocks walk from Union Square, and a bus line (the 38 I believe) stops right in front of the hotel.The hotel is nice, cute, they seem to have an underwater/fish theme in the rooms which was amusing. The room was small, but clean, and the bathroom was huge, no view to speak of (alley), but I didn't go to San Fran to look out the window. Also there was no a/c, which normally I wouldn't worry about in San Fran, but they had record highs while we were there. Opening our small window and turning on the ceiling fan made it cool enough to sleep.The front desk clerks were very friendly and helpful. We didn't bother with the continental breakfast, it didn't seem like much. Overall a nice stay, no complaints!"
41,1994,"May 21 2008 	Not again	We looked at the pictures of this hotel before booking it and thought it is a nice, clean, boutique hotel. When we get there, the lobby was really nice. We were still keeping high hopes. Everything changed when we got into our room. First; there was no air conditioning. We, as a couple, hate air conditioners because it makes both of us sick. However, this room was so hot, we begged for one. So, even if you do not like it, you need it when it is 100 degrees outside. Second bad thing were the towels in the bathroom. They were so old and had so many stains on them that we could not use them. The bed sheets were OK. The rooms are small. The neighborhood is fine if you do not mind homeless people. We only got scared in the night walking back to hotel, as there were so many bad looking people outside. As written in another review, if you exit the hotel and walk right, the neighborhood is pretty scary. Someone even asked us if we need any drugs!"
42,1994,"May 19 2008 	Horrible Dirty Hotel	We booked this hotel as it was fairly cheap and although it had some mixed reviews we thought we'd give it a try. That was a mistake! The hotel reception is nice, however when you get up to the rooms thats a different story. My bed sheets had cigarette burns, the carpets were filthy and on the last night I shared my bed with some bed bugs! The location of the hotel was good since it was near to Union Square, however if you turn right &amp; walk up the street its a pretty scary neighbour. Overall the hotel spoiled our trip to San Francisco, I'm just glad we were only there for 3 days, I couldn't have lasted any longer."
43,1994,"Apr 29 2008 	G-R-E-A-T!!!!!!!	We stayed there for 2 nights and had a great time. The room had hand-painted pictures of dolphins on the wall which was really neat. Besides, the room and bathroom was very clean and comfortable, JUST PERFECT!!!!!!! We just loved it!!!! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had many questions about public transportations and got them all answered very friendly and patient."
44,1994,"Mar 7 2008 	Great value!	Hotel with a friendly and helfull staff. The situation in the city is great, very close to Union Square.Rooms are not very big, but it is enough. The street is a liitle noisy.Don't expect too much at the breakfast, it is free but just coffe/tea, orange juice, muffins, and bread with marmelade and butter. It was ok for us, but there is many places in the neighborhood to have great ones.It is THE budget hotel in San Francisco."
45,1994,"Feb 27 2008 	great little hotel for cheap price	I looked at several hotels while booking my trip to the San Francisco area, and for the price and the location you can't beat the Adante, formerly the known as Hotel Nuvo. I had read other reviews of this hotel about complaints with homeless people, but like any other city, the homeless are there and did not bother me. be kind and at least say hello to them. They won't bite, but rather appreciate the camaraderie.The room I had requested was to be away from street noise and away from the elevator. While I did get a room on the 4th floor away from street noise, I was only a few steps away from the elevator. The rooms were quiet, comfy, clean, and spacious. It is equipped with a couch that doubles as a fold away, 2 night stands, desk, and complimentary in room tea and coffee. TV and phone are obviously included as well, along with extra pillows if needed.The bathroom is equally spacious, with an abundance of towels and amenities including hair dryer, and a closet with a security safe, iron and ironing board. The bed was comfy enough, although I did wake up a few times the first night due to my boisterous neighbors, which was no fault of the hotels.Altthough the entire hotel is non smoking, there is a slight lingering smell of smoke in the hallways. The staff could manage to also check the blankets for wear and tear as there was a patch and hole in the one I had. The continental breakfast was a bit dissapointing as there was none before 7a.m. The juice machine is shut off before this time as well. Another reason why I had booked here was for the continental breakfast. On the second day I did manage to catch a glimpse of their breakfast which was store bought pastries and white toast. On the third day I did not even bother with breakfast as it was already gone, but the juice machine was shut off and it was only around 10am. You are better off wandering the SF area on your own to find a place to eat which there are more than plenty and better than stick around for breakfast here. Besides, you get to experience the city this was as well. Overall I would come book here again."
46,1994,"Feb 20 2008 	Adante is my go-to hotel in SF now	In the past, I have stayed at the San Remo in North Beach, but wanted a place with private bathrooms and that was closer to the BART, without a huge price jump. I was very pleased with the Adante. The front desk staf was very friendly and helpful, there are great restaurants all around (Anjou, Colibri), theater -- you name it. Rooms were clean and always well-made, with hand-painted borders that gave it a warm and quirky touch. Continental breakfast is really not good, but there is a coffeeshop right next door with bagels for $1.50. Wifi in the lobby is free and works great -- if you want connection in the room, bring a wire for your computer. Walk to Powell street BART is easy,m even with luggage (as long as it rolls). Stayed at both the front and back ends of a work trip, and will be back in April!"
47,1994,"Jan 12 2008 	Faulty Towers comes to Frisco	Good location but that's where the fun stops. Horrible check-in experience.....after 14 hours direct from Sydney the clerk refused to give us a room at 10:30 am because checkin starts at 3:00 pm, even though he agreed that rooms were available. $20 cash fixed that little problem. Worst thing was the breakfast. No actual dining room so guests have to crowd around an alcove off the lobby with their crummy rations of self-serve white bread toast with jam and tea, coffee, juice etc. (Then walk downtown and pay to have a real breakfast). No bar, Internet cafe, business facilities....or anything really. Just the room."
48,1994,"Dec 28 2007 	Great deal for boutique hotel blocks away from Union Square	stayed for 9 nights. great price for a decent place just several blocks away from Union Square, shopping malls, BART, etc. TV was old but servicable and offered cable with no snowflakes. Room was tight but manageable...was only a place to store things and sleep. Restroom could be upgraded but still clean. Continental breakfast in lobby free. Had free internet access in room (cable). Great front desk help. Signed up city tours and shuttle service to airport thru front desk. If walking around late at night...stay on main road (Geary) dont stray off to side alley streets. Area is close &quot;ghetto&quot; area. Usually don't bother you but you never know what will happen."
49,1994,"Dec 13 2007 	I Agree - It's Fine	Though it's on the edge of a sketchy area, the Adante is pretty good, considering its place on the hierarchy of hotels. The standard rooms aren't very big, but they're just big enough for two. The bathrooms were renovated - nice and clean. The decor was pretty nice, and so were the linens. The people at the front desk were all nice and helpful. I kinda liked the mural on the wall. And the breakfast was enough to tide you over until lunch. It was a busy weekend (Nike Women's Marathon) and prices were through the roof at many places, so we were happy to stay at the Adante for a fairly reasonable $89 rate. I'd rather pay less, but I also didn't want to pay $300+ for a 3 or 4*."
50,1994,"Nov 5 2007	Great value	We were also a little worried about some of the bad reviews, but on this trip to the city we were extremely budget conscious and only needed a one night stay anyway. It is an old hotel, however, our bathroom was brand new, squeaky clean with jacuzzi tub, and the room itself was squeaky clean. Frankly, the bathroom newness/cleanliness and room cleanliness is what really matters to me anyway. So we were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the brief stay. Regarding noise; the walls were a bit thin, and I think only at one point did i hear any talking, but if you had loud neighbors i guess that could be a problem, although loud neighbors and be a problem with thicker walls too. we did hear some street noise (motorcycles and sirens). The only potential problem I saw was if you had a room near the ice machine. The ice machines were located close to rooms and i actually felt bad using it at night, because if the rooms adjacent to it were occupied, it would be obnoxiously loud. So when you reserve, make sure you are on a floor that doesn't have one or a room that is far away from it. For the price, it was great!!"
51,1994,"Oct 21 2007 	Don't worry it's OK	I was concerned about the varying reviews, but not to worry, it was an overall good experience. On arrival the receptionists (mainly seem to be students working part-time) were friendly and helpful. We were on a motorcycle tour and they recommended overnight parking in the adjacent street. The room was small but clean, the breakfasts were fresh and plentiful. The area is really central to the main shopping area, Macy's is only 5 mins walk. We ate at the Grand Cafe a couple of blocks east and would recommend it, great atmosphere. There are a lot of beggars about, but this is true of all areas, I had previously stayed at the Whitcomb Hotel on Market Street and to be honest the area around there was worse. If all you need is a well located clean room, don't hesitate to book the adante."
52,1994,"Oct 15 2007 	Would stay again and again!	This hotel is in a transitional area, the Tendloin/Nob Hill area. I felt safe, the room was as pictured on the website and EXCEPTIONALLY clean. The bathroom was as clean as can be! The hotel staff were exceptionally friendly, courteous, helpful. They printed tourist resources directly for me from the internet. Continental breakfast was white bread toast, coffee, store bought muffins. For the price in San Fran, the cleanliness, and the hospitality of all staff, I would definitely stay again!"
53,1994,"Sep 20 2007 	not so bad	Had a pleasant 4 nite stay at the Adante and read some very uneven reviews.For the money you know that you should lower your expectations, having said that front desk staff were always courteousand helpful, housekeeping was always on top of things, rooms done everyday and done right. We had the park and room rate and with the transit system in that town you don't need your vechile to get around. If you book a room at the back of the hotel away from the road we found it was quieter. But if people in the next room talk in loud voices early in the morning and late at nite, bang their door closed when they are coming and going, it doesn't really matter. As far as the area is concerned maybe not the best area in San Fran, but you could easily spend two or three times the money and stay in a upscale hotel a block or two away but your still in the same area with the same homeless people it is not just around the Adante! Skip the continental and go to Dotties or the Crepe house."
54,1994,"Sep 11 2007 	If you want clean and basic.....	We have previously stayed at the sister hotel, The York, and had a pleasant stay, so we thought we would give the Adante a try.This is an old fashioned, mid sized hotel in a good central location. The staff were very friendly, and the hotel was clean.The decor of the room was a bit strange (undersea mural painted on the walls), but the room was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed.The valet parking was superb, and I would recommend this hotel if you are having a short stay in the city and want somewhere convenient. It's not luxurious, but for the price it is great value for money, and we would definately stay again."
55,1994,"Aug 12 2007 	Great Hotel!	We enjoyed our stay at Adante Hotel &amp; would stay there again. We were greeted Tony at checkin who was always friendly &amp; helpful at the front desk. Our room was clean &amp; tidy with a huge ensuite, big TV, iron, safe &amp; ceiling fan. The area can feel a bit dodgy at night, but we felt safe going to &amp; from the hotel. The only negative is that the complimentary breakfast isn't very exciting, so we went to 'Dottie's True Blue Cafe' nearby &amp; enjoyed delicious breakfasts there."
56,1994,"Jul 31 2007 	Does exactly what it says on the tin	I have just come back from San Francisco. I stayed at the Adante hotel for 10 nights with my girlfriend and we don't have a single complaint about it. The hotel is clean, the rooms are cleaned everyday. The staff are friendly and helpful. Our toilet got blocked while we were there and we informed the front desk of this as we were leaving for a bite to eat. When we returned to our room the problem had been resolved. The hotel is is at the start of part of town called The tenderloin which has a lot of homeless people walking around. Although it could get a little bothersome being asked for change every 2 minutes walking around the area back to the hotel, not once did i have a problem with those people. They just ask and you walk on by. So i felt pretty safe there and didn't feel threatened at any time. I have read other reviews before i went where people have said the rooms smelled and what not. This is not my experience at all. Others said the decor of the rooms was bad. Well, why don't they stay at the Hilton then.I don't know anyone who goes on holiday to stay in their hotel room. I went to see San Francisco, not 4 walls of a room. If you want to see the city, the Adante is great."
57,1994,"Jul 23 2007	Good for the price	They were having computer problems and couldn't check us in right away. They locked our luggage in a room and bought us a couple of drinks while we waited. I'd only recommend the room as a place to sleep and shower. If you aren't planning on spending much time at your hotel it is perfect. It is clean, safe, and comfortable."
58,1994,"Jul 19 2007	Not bad for the price	My family and I stayed for 1 night and I must say, I had a few reservations after reading the previous reviews. However, the hotel was basic and old but clean. Our bathroom was quite new and very clean. The complimentary breakfast was adequate and there was plenty to fill up on. It was centrally located and an easy walk to Union Square (we have and 8yr old and 5yr old and they managed without a problem). The streets around the hotel werent the best and we made sure we were back indoors before dark. There were a lot of beggars which was intimidating. Overall, if you are looking for somewhere cheap, this hotel is fine. I probably wouldnt stay a week in it but 1 night was fine. Basically, you get what you pay for so dont expect the Ritz."
59,1994,Jul 16 2007 	Good place tos stay for the budget conscious	We arrived about 10.00pm and was advised by the friendly front desk staff member that we had been allocated a delux queen room. Room was a good size with a separate couch. Batthroom was very large. Room very clean and bed comfortable. All staff were very courteous and helpful. I would stay again and recommend this Hotel to others.
60,1994,"Jun 12 2007 	10/10 for great value for money	I stayed here in June 2007. I booked through expedia and got a great rate ($65/night). The hotel is centrally located. It is indeed not far from the sketchy part of the city (to the right as you exit the hotel), but it is still safe and only three blocks away from the Union Square and all the restaurants and shopping. (to the left as you exit)My room was on the 7th floor. It was definitely neither new nor well-decorated, but it was clean and had all the elements one really needs: comfy bed, good water pressure in the shower, spacious bathroom, telephone in the room, TV, hairdryer, coffee maker, iron and ironing board. If you are going to San Fran to hang out in your room, then you might want to pay more and stay somewhere fancy, but if you are there to explore and enjoy the city, this hotel is a great option. Some people in previous postings complained about the lack of AC, but I found the ceiling fan quite sufficient (during my stay in June, temperatures were reaching around 24 degrees). Actually, it was a bit chilly during the night and had to turn on the radiator.The hotel staff was exceptional  very friendly. The internet caf staff was super cool and you can also count on wicked music there as well. Overall, I will definitely be staying here again on my next visit. I would certainly recommend this hotel for an easy going traveler who can appreciate a good deal."
61,1994,"May 24 2007	Horriable Accomodations Good Service Great Location	My mother and I flew to San Francisco 5/19 for a concert and stayed one night at The Adante Hotel. The hotel definitely needs some work.1) The room accomodations were unsatisfactory. Apon walking into my room I was horrified by the color of the walls, which were a shade of yellow that looked ike someone had urinated on them. There was a hole in the wall that someone had unneatly covered and painted over. The murals on the walls simply show how cheap of a place this hotel is as they did not even purchase framed photographs for their rooms. The bed spread was worn and torn which prompted my mother and I to go out and purchase Lysol, spray down the bed, and sleep with our clothes on. At night, we were both very uncomfortable because the room was freezing and there was not AC control in the room and the door wasn't sealed correctly so light from the hallway pierced our room. Also, the window's lock was broken and a check makeshift lock was installed but one could still open the window from inside or out with the lock on. This made my mother and I feel very unsafe. The good thing is we only stayed one night, slept only 6 hours and checked out of the hotel as soon as we could in the morning.2) The service was decent. Julius the manager accomodated me very well and the desk clerk Tony was also very helpful in letting us know places to go around town. However, when my mother and I needed to store our bags, the clerk gave us a key to a side closet and we had to store our own bags - which means anyone could have had access to our things and easily stolen them.3) The location is good. 4-5 blocks from Union Square. However, when you walk out of the hotel go left not right, as the area borders Tenderloin - a not so friendly place. If asked would I stay at the Adante Hotel again, the answer would be definitely be no. The service and location don't make up for the horriable and disguisting hotel conditions. Even though its inexpensive, next time I'll pay the extra $30 bucks to stay at a nicer hotel."
62,1994,"Mar 23 2007 	You get what you pay for	For San Francisco, the location was very good and the price was quite reasonable. The doors were not very soundproof, but after each day of tiring touring we were not very disturbed by the noise in the hallway. The staff was very helpful. The room was overheated, but anyone who knew how to turn off a radiator and open a window could deal with it. Couldn't find a better deal for the money paid. Our room was waiting for us and we were satisfied. The &quot;continental breakfast&quot; was less than ok but the on site internet cafe provided a cheap supplement. This &quot;review&quot; mechanism did not allow me to give an accurate rating so I would say that the hotel is due a 3.8 out of 5."
63,1994,"Mar 5 2007 	Horrible - don't stay here	The service at this hotel was horrible!! The room was sweltering; we were told they were experiencing problems with their heating, and it could not be turned down. It was 85 degrees inside, 50 degrees outside, but the window only opened 6 inches. When we woke up the next morning, there was no hot water. Again, we were told there was a problem and they were working on it. After waiting over 2 hours for the problem to be fixed we ended up taking cold showers. When we checked out I asked if they were offering a discounted rate because of the problems. I was told they could credit us $3 for the Evian water we drank, but that was all. Of all the places to stay in SF, Don't stay here!!!!!!!"
64,1994,Feb 27 2007 	So so	No heater in room. Toilet just been renovated.Lift is very old n slow.Hotel is walking distance to Union square n cable car station.
65,1994,"Feb 13 2007	And it's close to Dottie's True Blue Cafe	Just what I was looking for. A comfortable, inexpensive place to hang out for a long weekend. The front desk clerk was very helpful, quickly finding me a nonsmoking room despite my early arrival. The room was clean and everything worked: the towels were clean and soft, there was plenty of hot water, the tub drained quickly, the lights didn't flicker and the TV and remote worked fine. For the price I paid ($54/night via Expedia) I don't take these things for granted! It was also convenient being able to get Internet access at the attached cafe without even having to step outside.And while the hotel isn't on a particularly charming block, it is just around the corner from Dottie's True Blue Cafe, a first rate breakfast place on Jones St. In summary the Adante is a good choice if 1) you're on a budget, and 2) you get a good price."
66,1994,"Feb 10 2007 	Adante will see our family again	The Adante suited our 6 night stay including a 14 month old. The front desk clerk upgraded our room to a suite for $10 per night, this was very affordable due to original nightly rate being $60 odd dollars. I appreciated that the clerk recognised we needed a little more room with tour toddler. I can recommend the Adante without a problem for families who wish to spend money on other things such as sight seeing etc. The room was newly renovated with big screen TV's in both king size bedroom and lounge that also converted into a fold out bed. The bathroom very clean and modern, in fact we were very satisfied with all the room features. Fresh coffee to brew when your room was made up every day, we had a back room which was very quite though I don't mind the noise in any case (sirens etc). The locality was great with Union Square and transport close, a Walgreens is a 2 minute walk on Geary Street so when any snacks or drinks required they could be collected close by. The staff were friendly and one afternoon is was too wet to venture out so we sat in the attached cafe with a delicious coffee (they serve beer too) and watched the world go by out on Geary street. Family friendly restaurants are within 2 minutes walks from the hotel (Diners or similar) so after dark you don't have to stroll to far in this is an issue. We'll give the Adante 10/10 for great value for money."
67,1994,"Feb 7 2007 	Good little place	This hotel is in a good location and at a good price. The room I had was clean and well presented if a little old. If you can ignore the rather misguided pink paint effect that covers walls and all woodwork then you should be pretty pleased. Hotel staff were very helpful and advised me of the one area not to walk after dark when I checked in which was helpful being a female travelling alone. Area felt safe to walk around at night and is handy for buses out to Pacific coast, as well as acceptable walk to cable car (4 blocks). Slight drawback was the toaster setting off the fire alarm 2 out of 3 mornings! Definitely get a MUNI pass as you can save your energy on those hills!Watch out for the Scientologists in the old Transamerica Building, they lure you in with an Open House sign, but do have a quick stop at Wells Fargo Museum in the Wells Fargo Bank, if you're at all interested in the real Wild West! The Thai place on the corner up from the hotel does quick, cheap, good food."
68,1994,"Dec 5 2006 	Great location 	What a wonderful old hotel in a wonderful location in San Francisco. Just 4 safe blocks from Union Square, near the theatres &amp; lots of shopping. The lobby has a nice fireplace, relaxing chairs &amp; sofas, and a variety of very handsome men who work at the check-in. The hotel attracts a wide variety of visitors - esp. families with children, foreign travelers, and gay &amp; straight singles &amp; couples.I was surprised at the level of service for such a great price. From check-in to check-out, it was very smooth. They have a free baggage room so you can store your bags safely if you arrive early or leave late. The maids are very helpful &amp; the rooms are very clean. There is a free continental breakfast, with an attached bar/grilll if you want more.The only downsides were no view out of the window &amp; a smoke-detector that went off when I took a shower. Luckily there was no fire, because no one showed up when the alarm went off. LOL.I would gladly stay there again (as I did at Thanksgiving), and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great, safe, and welcoming hotel at a nice price."
69,1994,"Nov 28 2006 	Old....	Girlfriend had booked this one, and we arrived separately. Without her presence, I was unable to check in. With a stressful arrival, this was not appreciated. In the end, we maybe could've prepared better somehow...Room was very old and was about as solid as a cardboard box. Room did not smell great either. Was a very average experience. Baggage storage was not secure at all, was open to any guest requesting its facilities. Was an open storeroom where you put your bags with everyone else's and while there were tags to place on your bags, anyone could go through anyone else's bags. Was not a comforting experience."
70,1994,"Nov 4 2006 	My new favorite in Union Square	Of all the hotels I've stayed at in SF the Adante is the best in terms of value. I paid $64.80 for a room for one night. They honored my request for the top floor at the back. Room 710 contained two double beds, the usual furnishings, a safe, newly remodelled bathroom with all new fixtures, hair dryer, iron and ironing board. Walls were handpainted with rural scenes and tropical fish--not very well done but it gave the room some character. With the ceiling fan and the window cracked open there was plenty of ventilation. I couldn't believe how quiet it was. With the window open all night I heard nothing beyond the occasional siren in the distance. The location is great, a few blocks from Union Square. I went to the Curran Theater that night so after the play it was nice to able to walk home in less than 5 minutes. The breakfast was skimpy, just muffins toast and coffee, but at this price I think that's acceptable. There are many good coffee shops nearby if you need more. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. I can't imagine finding a better deal in San Francisco."
71,1994,"Oct 17 2006 	Good budget hotel option	After looking at tripadvisor to find a hotel in S.Francisco i decided for Adante hotel as it seemed a good value and good reviews.I've just came back from S.Francisco, staying at this hotel for 4 nights and I agree with the other travellers I was satisfied.I asked for a quiet room in the back and I got it and the staff was very friendly.I got all what you expected in a good budget hotel, the only think I missed was a refrigerator.The location is also very convenient."
72,1994,"Oct 15 2006 	Great location very friendly good value.	My daughter and I traveled to San Francisco and wanted to stay at a place that was convenient, safe, clean and affordable. This hotel was perfect. The cable cars are just a few blocks away and the bus stops downstairs. The cafe at street level offers wireless internet and GREAT coffee. The staff was always helpful. If you are not accustomed to street noise you might want to book a room in the rear. We felt it just added to the feel of this wonderful city."
73,1994,"Oct 10 2006 	Great value for money	Booking a 1* hotel sight unseen can be a bit risky but we were delighted with our choice. We caught the BART from the airport to Powell St and wheeled our luggage to the Adante. Our plane arrived early in the morning but they have a luggage room for storing baggage when necessary. The room was small but clean, quiet and comfortable, which is all we ask in a hotel. The bus at the door goes to Golden Gate Park and y ou can walk to the cable cars and Union Square. Breakfast of muffins, toast, juice and coffee is enough to get you going for the day and the internet cafe right next door is very convenient. Would have no hesitation in staying here again."
74,1994,"Oct 9 2006 	Excellent value for money	We stayed at this hotel for two nights in September and it was excellent.As we were in a city centre I asked for a room on a high floor in a quiet area. When we checked in we were given room 711. This is on the top floor (I think) and right at the back. The room was really quiet and just what we wanted.We flew into town and got the BART train into the city. This was really easy and cheap $5.15 each and the hotel is only about a 5-10 walk from the train stop. If you do this I would however recommend you walk up Powell and along Geary st as opposed to taking a direct route from the train station to the hotel like we did. Unfortunately this takes you through the homeless area which wasn't too pretty.The hotel itself is clean, the room was big enough for us with an excellent bathroom. The shower was low but this seems to be the done thing in America as every hotel we stayed in had a low shower. The reception staff were helpful and gave us a handy map of the city which was excellent. They also marked out any areas to avoid.The breakfast is basic with Coffee, Juice, Toast and Cakes but this was more than enough to enable you to get out sightseeing quickly. The location was good, really close to the shops. The walk to the Pier, Alcatraz takes about 40 mins and involves a few hills, so if this is your main focus you might want to stay a little closer or get a tram.The only downside was the window in our room didn't lock, however when we looked at the drop out from it we realised no one would try it.In summary an excellent hotel and I would recommend to anyone going to San Francisco who doesn't want to spend all their money on hotels"
75,1994,"Oct 9 2006	Great Hotel	Was very suprised at the great quality of this hotel considering it's price and 1 star class rating. The receiption area was bright and modern ... the rooms very clean with a huge bed ... bright and airy and very comfortable ... rooms had a safe, were secure ... the bathroom was big and our room even had a jacuzi ... have stayed in other hotels in the area for roughly the same price and they were so bad compared to this hotel ...i strongly recommend staying at this hotel ... it's location is great, it's very clean and brilliant value for money. Could not have been happier ...."
76,1994,"Oct 7 2006 	Great budget hotel	On my first trip to San Francisco the Adante hotel was both cheap, clean, and in a very convienent location. The rooms were small but very clean and cozy. The contiental breakfast wasn't anything but muffins and coffee, but at least it saved us from buying breakfast for our three day stay. I would reccommend the hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay while vacationing in the city. I don't think that the hotel would be very good for families, but was perfect for my boyfriend and I (a couple in their young twenties). The only advice that I would give is make sure not to take a right turn out of the hotel as the neighborhood gets a bit sketchy, ( we made this mistake but luckily in the daytime, even though it was still very scary!) but as long as you head towards union square you will be fine. Great place for people on a budget looking for a clean and nice hotel!"
77,1994,"Oct 6 2006 	Cute hotel! would stay here again.	I wasn't expecting this hotel to be great as it is rated 1 star but I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel had a warm cozy feeling to it throughout our whole stay.My friend and I didn't have a great arrival to San francisco as we had travelled from LA to this hotel on coach for over 8 hours so it was late at night when we checked in. Upon arrival the first thing you will notice about San francisco is the amount of homeless people on the street. Anyway when we arrived at the hotel the staff were friendly with check in and the room we were given was so cute. it was clean and well equipped with TV, coffee maker and essentials.Through out our whole stay we had no problems with the hotel, and if you ever find your way to San Francisco then I would suggest you stay here. You will not regret it! It is also in a great location...5 mins away from the main shopping center and easily accessable to any other popular attraction!There is a cool little cafe across the street owned by a Chinese couple who serve great food! I recommend you visit them and give it a try. Also one particular staff member who is friendly and helpful is Mart so seek him out."
78,1994,Sep 24 2006 	Great place	An older style hotel but in a great location. Rooms were clean and good size. Hotel staff were very good and the price is right for San Francisco.Will stay again without any problems.
79,1994,"Sep 12 2006 	Good deal would return for sure!	We stayed at the Adante hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of August. The place felt warm and welcoming. Staff were nice and I liked this hotel as soon as I opened the door.The room we had was on the last floor at the back and this was great because no noise was to be heard from the steet. The room size was ok, manageable for us who had two suitcases. It was clean and comfortable. And the decoration added to the ambiance!We went a couple of times to the coffee shop adjacent to the hotel to relax or simply read the papers. Charming place.The location is great even though, late at night or really early in the morning you can observe homeless people wandering around. Still, I felt safe at all time.So, great place, great value for my money. Would go back anytime!"
80,1994,"Aug 23 2006	Brilliant location	We were really pleased with the Adante hotel. The location is great - you are 5 minutes from Union Square and it is on a bus route and handy for cable cars too. You felt safe walking around the area day and night, important as we had a teenager with us. We had two rooms, painted with a jungle theme to put you in the holiday mood. Whilst the rooms were a little tired, they were clean and offer good value for money. Breakfast was pretty basic - toast and muffins, but stoked you up for a while. Tony on the front desk was really helpful and offered good advice about the city. The restaurant across the road from the hotel does lovely food and the internet cafe is handy for coffee and even more muffins."
81,1994,"Aug 9 2006 	Great Value! No complaints!	This hotel didn't look particularly great on the websites I viewed but we wanted somewhere reasonable to stay. The hotel was excellent! The staff were friendly, the rooms were really clean and comfortable. There is a great little coffee shop/ internet cafe/ bar which was great for a quick coffee or drink in the afternoon. The location was ideal near the theatres and close to Union Square. Also plenty of taxis and, if you want to take the bus or trolley, the staff will point you in the correct direction. Our room had a huge bathroom and the room was large too. We were offered an upgrade for a bit more money but didn't take it because the upgraded room was a bit smaller (but it had a hottub).No complaints! Great value!"
82,1994,"Jul 26 2006 	Dolphins on the ceiling	I was travelling alone so looking for somewhere safe, central and affordable. I booked the hotel on the basis of other Trip Advisor reviews so thought it was time to reciprocate. It is a nice hotel in a very central location. Five minute walk into Union Square, 10 mins to the cable car/metro. Yes, there are a quite a lot of homeless people on the street as you walk back from Union Square, but I never felt threatened by anyone.The hotel is clean, comfortable and friendly. The reception staff are very keen to help. Cleaners overenthusiastic so do remember to put the 'do not disturb' sign out at night. There is a good internet cafe downstairs which is also a relaxed place for a single traveller to enjoy a coffee or a beer. It is open until 9.30.Rooms may be small by US standards but pretty standard for a European 2/3 star hotel. Perfect for a single traveller, but my room would have been ok for couples. I kept the curtains closed as I looked out directly into another window,but the room had very good lighting. And it was so quiet.And there are dolphins, angel fish and Nemo in some of the rooms........."
83,1994,"Jul 24 2006	Satisfactory	Took a vacation to San Francisco July 19 - 22. Adante Hotel was where we stayed. It was a pretty small room but we were only there to sleep and take showers. For the budget, it was ok. The front desk clerks Mark &amp; Tony were very helpful. The free continental breakfast was not so good, could be better. Had a problem with our sink but reported it to the maid and when we got back it was fixed. I had nightmares about the noise but we were put in the back on the second floor and it was very quiet. We even had our window open. I would stay again here when I go back to San Francisco. Very convenient to everything.Vangie F.,Georgia"
84,1994,"Jul 7 2006	Tiny rooms get you out and about	I was a bit apprehensive about this hotel after confirming a rate of $69 per night (parking not included) and seeing on my map that it was close to the Tenderloin district. However, the Adante surpassed my expectations. It was only a few blocks from Union Square and very nice hotels were in the near vicinity (JW Mariott, Hotel Monaco, etc.).It is very European in design - i.e. the room barely fits a queen size bed with a desk with the TV on top. My husband &amp; I had 2 suitcases and it was a bit of a tight fit. However, the bathroom was bigger than most in London AND it had a fan, which is a must if you like hot showers, but not a steamy room. The room and bathroom were clean. The hallways can be a bit noisy  doors are wood  but we never had trouble with noise at night."
85,1994,"Jul 5 2006	For the adventurous not for families	If you don't mind the smell of marijuana in your room at check in, the homeless and bath houses in the area plus the occasionally prostitute and drug dealer hawking their wares also in this neighborhood you won't mind staying here. I wouldn't walk alone at night personally (female) but otherwise it's certainly not the worst part of town. It is a bit dodgy though. Location is fairly close to main attractions. Good for the adventurous college student or other adventurous souls. I wouldn't recommend for families. Rooms are decent and fairly clean. A bit too much noise from the street. We ended up checking out after the hotel management couldn't manage to check us in properly (plus, we didn't like the smell of marijuana in our room nor the stunned looks on our teenagers' faces when we opened the hotel room)."
86,1994,"Jun 29 2006	Good Budget Hotel	Having stayed at alot of budget hotels, I can honestly tell you about the good, the bad, and the ugly. Adante Hotel definitely falls into &quot;the good&quot; catagory. Once again, this is a budget hotel.....so if you're looking for luxury, this is not for you. But if you're going to be out sightseeing all day (like me) and stop by the room every now and then, and want a good place to crash at nite, then this is the place for you. I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at the hotel. Check-in was a breeze. The front desk clerk was friendly and very helpful. The room itself was spotless, although somewhat small....ok for 1 or 2 people, but that's it. I liked the funky paintjob. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was exceptionally clean...looked brand new. The room also included a large closet with ironing board and iron. Internet acess was provided as well as coffee pot with selection of coffee/teas. Bottled water was provided at extra charge and was clearly labled as such. Cable TV also provided. No AC, but there was a large ceiling fan that did the job. Continental breakfast was included from 7-9am at no extra charge. There is an elevator, but it is somewhat slow. My only complaints....bathroom towels were kinda cheap, maid service will knock on your door at 8am...loudly... if you don't hang the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door, and the view from my room was that of a brick wall. So except for these few minor things, I would definitely stay at the Adante again. A couple of extra notes....Adante Hotel is in the Union Square &quot;area,&quot; not on Union Square. In fact, it's quite a bit of an uphill walk from Union Square and the Bart/Muni public transport stations. This can be kinda annoying if you've been walking around the city all day. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, so you may want to take that instead of walking. The cool thing is that the Powell street cable car line is very close. And yes, the neighborhood has it's share of crack [--] and street people. But if you're used to large city life, you won't care. When I was there, these people mainly kept to themselves. I'ts not nearly as bad as you might think by reading some other people's reviews. So, all in all, Adante Hotel is a good place to stay for the budget sightseer or student traveller. I would go back again."
87,1994,"Jun 24 2006	It's an OK hotel	We stayed for 6 nights; we just had one problem, which was the toilet flooding on our first night. The hotel staff were really good took care of it straight away when we reported it. The rooms were reasonably clean (mould on the carpet near the radiator); there was no air con only a fan on the ceiling could do with some modernisation. Hotel staff were really friendly, I think the place is ok considering what you pay. The Adante was in a good location, within walking distance to Union Square, only downside is there are quite a few homeless people nearby who beg for money but they don't pose any real threat. There is bus stop right outside the hotel that heads down to Union Square. If I return to San Francisco I would stay here again."
88,1994,"May 23 2006 	clean budget hotel	Just returned and thought the folks at the Adante deserved some well earned praise. Exceptionally clean rooms, everything was quite spotless. The rooms were a little small, we ( a family of 4 with 10,12 year olds) were a little squashed, but not horribly. We got upgraded to their junior suite and the kids did fine in the pull out sofa. I always do a spot inspection when getting to a hotel ( toilets, lights, tv, etc) and this place passed wonderfully. We stayed for four nights, got a late c/o and still paid only $500.US. total. That qualifies as a good bargain in San Fran. Nobody mentioned that there was a laundry mat next door for families with kids. The free muffins in the morning were tasty, and the oj was a nice touch. Staff were pleasant and helpful, a great place that was certainly a great deal. Well done, Adante !!"
89,1994,"Apr 29 2006	Not bad budget hotel	We stayed 4 nights at this hotel after reading many reviews and in my opinion it is not a bad hotel. The good points are:*price and value is good if you're on a budget.*about 7/8 mins walk to Union Square/ 15 for Chinatown/near Powell Street*the bathroom and bed linen were very clean*breakfast is simple but atleast included, the blueberry muffins are nice*although not in the greatest area we felt safe* we asked to move rooms as near front of the hotel is noisey this was not a problem*front desk were v helpful, polite and knew info requiredNot so good points:*there is alot of homeless people but they leave you alone*i disliked the decor inside the hotel, v dated and needs modernising, if you like fishes and v colourful marine life you're in for a treat*there was a funny smell in the rooms, believe this maybe due to the carpets need renewing"
90,1994,"Mar 30 2006	lovely clean hotel nice staff	We chose the Adante hotel on the basis of it's excellent reviews on trip advisor, and we were not disappointed, the room was immaculately clean, as was the bathroom and all the communal areas. As we were travelling with 2 small children cleanliness was important to us. Staff at the Adante were always helpful and polite and on one morning when my husband was about to take our 1 year old daughter out at 5am to get her something to eat, the hotel concierge got her a muffin early from the breakfast tray. The location of the hotel is excellent, we were worried it was a bit close to the tenderlon but it is more in the theatre district and close to some really smart hotels, and great for a shopaholic like to me to get to all the great shops!All in all I would heartily recommend the adante hotel, it has a great breakfast and really comfy foyer to have your breakfast and plan your day."
91,1994,"Feb 23 2006	You know what it's really an ok hotel!	I stayed at the Adante this past weekend, and although I felt a little uneasy walking into our rooms due to the lack of windows and ridiculous decor, I immediately settled in and was suprisingly comfortable in my surroundings. The rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable, and the management is very helpful. I checked in at 4am on the day I arrived and they ended up not charging me for that night, they just called it an early check in. There was also a discrepancy with the price quote I was given and that was immediately rectified by the polite and friendly manager without hesitation! In the mornings there is a free continental breakfast in the lobby which consists of OJ, coffee, and bread and a toaster with butter and jams. Off of the lobby there is a small cafe with free internet. If you're looking for the Four Seasons or even the Holiday Inn, this place is not for you. However, if you're looking for a basic room to rest your head and to take a shower in a clean eviornment and then leave to enjoy the city, this place is for you. My only advice is if you valet your car, call way in advance as it takes more than the 10 minutes that they tell you. You can't beat this hotel for its location and price. I would stay here again."
92,1994,"Jan 30 2006	Great Value - Great Experience	My rating of &quot;Above Average&quot; is based on the value I got for my dollar. It's not a five star hotel, but it doesn't claim to be, either. It was clean, quiet and comfortable, which is all I care about when I'm spending most of my time exploring the city. The rooms aren't huge, but there is adequate space to lay down your luggage and move around the room (the bathrooms were especially roomy, which my girlfriend appreciated). The beds were comfortable, and I didn't hear a peep from any of my neighbors. The staff was helful and friendly, which is always appreciated. Location was pretty good - somewhere between Chinatown and Japantown, which turned out to be the two places we spent most of our time. I didn't think the area was any worse or better than most places we visted. I did encounter a few homeless people within a few blocks of the hotel, but it seemed like there were homeless people everywhere I went and was therefore nothing out of the ordinary. If you stay anywhere downtown, it's going to be the same."
93,1994,Nov 16 2005	Great deal	This is a great hotel for someone who isn't going to spend a lot of time there...i.e. there is no pool/spa/gym. However our room and bathroom were very clean. The staff were very nice and helpful. It was so close to Union Square (about 4 short blocks) and the start of the Cable Cars (a few streets down). My friend and I were even able to walk to Chinatown in 20 minutes but public transportation is right outside the door if you are not up for walking. There is a daily continental breakfast included in your stay and if you want something more there is a really cute cafe attached to the lobby. My friend and I took the airport shuttle from the hotel for $14 or you can catch the BART which is a few blocks away.All in all I thought this hotel was excellent for the $85/nt price tag right in the middle of the more expensive hotels. I am going to suggest it to everyone I know planning on visiting San Francisco.
94,1994,"Nov 8 2005 	Nice but...	My AA flight landed very late, so check in about 1 am.After first night (half the night actually) I had to change the room because I was only by myself but room was two bed equipped. No problem but there were no TV remote controler in the 'new' room (I asked for it twice with no succes).Bathroom fan was 'yelling' horribly.Rooms were clean and good looking."
95,1994,"Oct 26 2005	Bargain rates - okay stay	The Adante Hotel is situated in the Tenderloin but it is within walking distance of Union Square. The area isn't so bad, but it's not great either. If you go past Geary St to another block (ex: O'Farrell), massage parlors are abundant, and so are the homelessness and prostitution. The Adante Hotel rates are cheap. The day that I checked in, I was given a particular room. When I returned that same day, I learned that all of my things were moved without my authorization into an even smaller room. To make up for the inconvenience, the manager gave me 2 free servings of draft beer for 4 nights (at the bar/cafe that is connected to the hotel. btw, that bar/cafe happens to have a couple of health code violations). I don't know about you - but draft beer isn't the best solution to ease my problems of having someone touch and move your personal belongings."
96,1994,"Oct 12 2005 	Bad Experience	The hotel it self was not bad the one big problem is it is a non smoking hotel. They make you sign a paper saying that you won't smoke in the room or you will be fined $150. Now from my friend and I going out to the bars that night and being smokers, They charged me 150 cause it smelled like a little smoke in the room."
97,1994,"Sep 26 2005	Lets be fair here	I was happy with my stay at the Adante. Small rooms? Sure, but most European Style Hotels have smaller rooms. Despite the claims of paper thin walls I heard nothing from my neighbors in my whole stay. Sketchy neighborhood? Not really. I traveled alone and I never felt unsafe. However I did take a cab late (After Midnight) at night as to not be waiting at or walking from bus stops alone. During the day its perfectly fine. Going west of that block while alone, at night might not be ideal, but walking to and from Union Square is not big deal.  Remember what you are paying in comparision to the other on shared bathroom hotels in the area. it isn't a five star and it doesn't bill itself as such. These are all things one needs to keep in mind. My only complaint if you can even call it that is that housekeeping makes it rounds rather early. My advice is if you go out to enjoy the night life, make sure you put your DND sign up before crawling into bed. The staff has always been super helpful and nice. Even before my stay I called with questions, and they were very happy to answer them. They helped me figure out MUNi route and find bus stops and other little things that made my stay much better. I am returning to the Adante next month and I am looking forward to another positive experience."
98,1994,"Aug 10 2005	Great Value!	Stayed at the Adante Hotel from 7/29 thru 8/1 and were very impressed with the value of this budget hotel. I was somewhat skeptical and paranoid about the location being on the edge of the tenderloin district but the location turned out to be excellent. We hauled suitcases at 9:30 at night from the Powell Street Station up to the hotel with absolutely no problems. Had two teenager with us, quite an eye opener for them with all the hustle bustle and happenings on the street. The hotel itself was very clean, unique and friendly. I suppose you could pay the same and stay at a Holiday Inn but you would be experiencing cookie cutter boredom. Not so at the Adante. Our room was small but adequate and did I mention clean? Our room faced Geary so it was noisy if the windows were left open but we closed them at night and ran the ceiling fan and this was more than comfy and I sleep hot. The front desk was friendly and helpful, the continental breakfast is good enough to hold you over til you can get some real breakfast. Dont expect luxury, but for what you pay you will be more than pleasantly surprised!!!"
99,1994,"Jul 31 2005	Got stuck in the elevator	We got stuck in the elevator, and the management didn't seem to care. When we tried to talk to the manager on duty Julian gave us another person to call when we called it we didn't get anyone, it was always busy. So we called back down to speak with the general manager about this problem and Julian tried to brush it off, after requesting to speak with the general manager he never got back to us. Julian even went as far as to lie to us and say it has never happened, but later when he was pushed about the problem he admitted it does happen often. They made it seem like it was our fault their elevator isn't working correctly, the elevator should be shut down. So be careful, you can only have 4 people in it (a sign would be nice). Also, when we checked in they made it sound like we were being upgraded to a suite, the problem is we clearly paid for a room with 4 adults but ended up with a room with one bed and a sofa bed. The sofa bed was not comfortable at all! We ended up paying around 119 a night, which is so not worth it. When we got back to our room the next day the maid had forgot to make the sofa bed up which was clearly pulled out and used. The rooms are also tacky! It has a tropical theme painted around the ceiling. We also had a lovely view of a net, I have no clue what the net was for. The one thing this hotel almost has going for it is location. At night down some streets it can be pretty scary, but it is pretty close to a nice area. It isn't in a nice area, but it is close to one. If you like this area try another hotel, there are many around it. We used tripadvisor to book this room from the reviews, but when we got there it all went wrong."
100,1994,"Jul 25 2005	Good deal for the price	The Adante Hotel is located in a convenient spot and is a good base for a weekend of sightseeing. The rooms are what you'd expect from a budget hotel: small, utilitarian, and lacking the amenities that you'd find in higher-priced hotels. The rooms are very clean, and the management was professional. I had no problems checking in or out. The rooms were quiet, although you could hear the sounds of the city below with the window open. The window was open because there is no A/C. This is not a horrible thing given the frequent breeze in SF, but you'll want to know that there's no A/C ahead of time. I lucked out with a weekend of beautiful cool weather, but you'll want to check the weather forecast before booking here to ensure you're not in a heat wave. The murals painted on the walls are kind of kitschy and fun in a weird way. I would stay here again if the weather was cool enough."
101,1994,"Jul 20 2005	We liked Adante	Good location,helpfull,friendly staff,free breakfast(toast,coffee,juice and muffins).Easy going and relaxed,with a European feel,no A/C but big ceiling fans,good price for SF,just what we wanted."
102,1994,Jul 19 2005 	good times	we (few friends and I) had a great time at the Adante. Staff was friendly and helpful. We'll stay there again as this is an affordable place well maintained; plus it is right downtown.
103,1994,"Jul 12 2005	Cheap AND Surprisingly Pleasant Stay In San Francisco	I loved this hotel. When my boyfriend originally booked this room and told me that he got a hotel room in San Francisco for less than $50 per night during April (one of the best months to visit San Francisco...the other is October), I was weary of his decision making skills. I looked online prior to going just to check out the Adante. From what I saw, people seemed to like it except for the cheesy looking murals on the guestroom walls. We were only going for the weekend, and I thought, &quot;Well, why not?&quot; This hotel is GREAT! It is in a great location. We took the BART to Powell Station, and the hotel is about 1/2 a mile northwest (right down the street from Union Square). From the outside, the physical characteristics of the hotel do not do the service of the staff and the quality of the rooms justice. It really does look historic. However, the lobby is very nice. They have plush sofas inside to sit on and rest, and patio furniture outside so that you can enjoy the hustle &amp; bustle of the city. The service at the front desk is just about the best that I have ever received. The man at the front desk was extremely professional. He gave us maps of the city and made suggestions for us first-time visitors. We arrived early and they even let us use a storage room for our luggage until we checked out.There is a cafe connected to the hotel. It is an Internet cafe so that makes it very convenient. I ordered a cappuccino, however, I would not order another one. They were very nice in there, but the coffee was not anything special. It tasted more like hot water than espresso. Every morning there was a continental breakfast. Not much food, just blueberry muffins, juice and coffee, but hey for $50 a night I wasn't even expecting that. We checked in at 3PM on a Saturday, and we received a room on the 6th floor facing the alley and neighboring buildings. It was not a view worth starring out at, but I thought it was cool and appreciated it because I have never lived in a big city so it kind of gave me the impression of what it would be like to look out your window if you lived in New York City (see attached pictures). There was also chicken wire above the alleyway to keep birds from flying into the rooms as there are no screens on the windows. BE CAREFUL OF FALLING OUT! :-) Very few of the rooms face out over Geary Street. I would say not more than three rooms on each floor so about 18-21 rooms. The ride up to the room in the elevator is quite scary. The elevator is nice inside but it seemed as if it was the original &quot;lift.&quot; It wobbled and creaked as it made its way up the floors.  The room was cozy. NO A/C but this never bothered us. We opened the window, and there was a ceiling fan in the room to generate air circulation. There is a heater in the room which we never needed to use. The weather was beautiful. We had one king bed and a sofa with a pullout. The TV was recessed into the wall so that saved space. There was a small desk w/ Evian Bottled Water (for purchase) and a coffee maker w/ free coffee. The bathroom was surprisingly nice. It had been fully remodeled and kept up to date. The shower was very clean as was the sink and toilet. There was also a large closet in the bathroom that contained hangers, a safe and an ironing board. I believe that the bathroom used to be a guestroom because you could actually enter the bathroom from both the hallway and our room. It was a private bath also (not shared). The murals on the wall were kind of cheesy. It would be more fitting for a room in Puerto Rico (with the birds, fish and pastel colors), but it honestly didn't bother me because I was satisfied with the overall quality of the room and the service.In the elevator, I heard a few conversations regarding noise that people were hearing throughout the night, but I never heard anything. I have stayed in hotels where all you can hear is the party next door or people stomping on the floor above you, but it always seemed quiet to me when we were in the room. There are thousands of beautiful and exquisite hotels in San Francisco from what I saw when I was there. I would gladly stay at the Adante Hotel again. I was extremely pleased with the service and quality. You would never expect it from passing by, but it really was a pleasant stay here. I would recommend it to couples, singles and people enjoying the sites of the city. I probably wouldn't recommend it for families unless you get 2 rooms just because the rooms are a tad bit smaller than your run-of-the-mill Motel 6 (but better quality). The hotel is also right on the Geary Street bus line which runs every 10 minutes during the day. Give it a try. I think you'll agree."
104,1994,"Jun 20 2005	Not that cheap not that nice	We stayed at the Adante for about $80 after taxes in an attempt to save money. The building itself is sort of musty, and the rooms are not much better. Bad carpet, unkempt bathrooms, and worst of all, bed bugs. Staff was fine. Did not use the cafe/bar but it did not look like much. Very much a hostel environment. &quot;Free breakfast&quot; consists of meager coffee and croissants. Do not recommend unless you bring your own sheets and are really strapped for cash."
105,1994,"Jun 4 2005	Close to Union Square	I found this hotel to be a great base, I mean who needs a luxuary hotel, when you're going to be out all day and then just need somewhere to rest your head at night? It was really cheap to stay here with lastminute, we paid 25 a night for our room! It's a 5 minute walk from union square and getting on trolleys etc, near some bars and restaurants and the staff are really helpful and really friendly. Ok the rooms aren't decorated to the best of taste, but it added some amusement to our video diary! I would stay here again!"
106,1994,"May 24 2005	You Can Do Better	Mixed (really bad and really great) service and tiny, noisy, and HOT rooms with no breeze made for a miserable experience."
107,1994,"May 19 2005	excellent affordable hotel	if you want a hotel with some character (they have murals in all rooms) this hotel is a must. it is in a great location near union square. the staff are very friendly and very helpful. it has an internet cafe/bar attached, and staff here are great too. i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a great experience in San Fransisco and for all budget travellers."
108,1994,"Apr 29 2005	Something's fishy at the Adante	I stayed here for three nights in April 2005. Booked a &quot;king suite&quot; which was supposed to have two rooms plus bath. Instead, had one room that was approximately 4 feet wider and 2 feet longer than a king-sized bed. The dresser drawers could not be opened fully as they hit the bed. Very noisy, facing Geary Street. No a/c. When we checked in, hotel said the room I had requested (been promised??) was already in use. Nice bathroom with jacuzzi tub, though very noisy fan made it unpleasant. No closet, just a place to hang clothes. Not perfectly clean but not terrible. We visited friends who were staying at the Adagio which was much nicer. There are a couple of other hotels along Geary that also looked worth checking out. Try the Savoy, it looked fun. The fish murals are pretty funky. The location of this hotel was great, the little cafe off the lobby was nice, the staff was pleasant though unwilling to move me. Reminded me a bit of European hostels."
109,1994,Mar 16 2005	Great for Finding Nemo	Stayed here last May. Initial impressions were a little negative but staff were very friendly and complimentary breakfast was great. The location was excellent and overall was very enjoyable stay. Will stay again definately. Do not be put off by the the fish tank theme rooms.
110,1994,"Feb 16 2005	Not a bad little hotel	Location was great for the price. Neighborhood wasn't bad, if you're coming from Union Square. I wouldn't recommend walking further down Geary than the hotel, though. We did have a problem with the cable service -- the hotel didn't have an NBC channel, and CBS was horribly scrambled for 4 of the 7 days we were there and the non-manangement hotel staff didn't seem to care. The internet cafe in the hotel was very convenient, and if you bring your laptop you can access the internet from the lobby or your room. If you don't have an ethernet cable, the front desk will loan you one for free. If you arrive before 3pm for check-in, you can do early check-in for $10."
111,1994,"Jan 25 2005	Clean Inexpensive Good Location	Good, Central Location - 3.5 blocks from Union Square and in an area with a lot of chic bars (2 blocks from the Clift Hotel). Felt safe - just have to be aware of surroundings. Rooms - Small but clean. Free Internet in the rooms and free wireless internet in the lobby cafe was a plus!Price - For $55/night, it was a great deal.Atmosphere - I agree with the reviewer who said it was &quot;studenty&quot; although I did see some families there as well."
112,1994,"Jan 13 2005	Good location nice bar	This is an oddly 'studenty' hotel, the little internet bar/cafe is great and the staff are young and friendly and relaxed. The room me and my mate had was pretty small and with a horrible view and very loud air conditioning. The lift takes forever to get to you. It's dead handy for the city though and is just a short walk to Union Square. Not the greatest but for the price it was basically what we expected."
113,1994,"Jan 10 2005	Do you like parrots?	Rooms were clean, bathrooms were clean and roomy, decor was cute (if you like birds). Hotel was within easy walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown in downtown San Fran. Not the safest neighborhood to walk around in at night, but not terrible, either. I stayed with three other girls (20 years old), and we didn't feel too uncomfortable. Definetely recommend to someone who is looking for a cheap place to stay in a good central location."
114,1994,"Nov 27 2004	Good place to stay	Just returned from our stay over Thanksgiving (2004). This hotel is in a great location. Close to everything, trolley, shopping, etc. Rooms a little small, but there is soo much to do in San Francisco that we only slept &amp; showered there so didn't matter to us. The front desk staff was very helpful and polite. I would stay here again."
115,1994,"Nov 22 2004	we loved it`	My friend and I stayed here from Nov. 15 to 19/04. The staff was very friendly and helpful booking our city tour and checking things for us on the internet (thank you Asam). Our room was small, but clean and more than adequate and comfortable. The continental breakfast was not much to speak of, but the coffee and orange juice were good and if you like blueberry muffins... that was all they served for the four days we were there. But we really enjoyed getting our coffee in the lobby and then having a bagel next door in the cafe. The location was perfect, 3 blocks from Union Square. There were a few homeless people around our hotel, but you will find them everywhere in this city. And they pretty much leave you alone. For the price we paid ($56) you can't beat the Adante."
116,1994,"Oct 31 2004	A nice lil hotel	I stayed at the adante on october 29th, I got a great rate for 70$, I had no problems checking into my room at 2pm, the staff had my name on the computer instantly and was quite friendly, the room was on the small side, but i actually liked the paintings on the walls, (fish), the bathroom was quite large considering that the room wasn't that large, I loved the fact that the TV had HBO, and that the room was nice and clean, it also had an in room safe and a iron and ironing board. I didn't need to use any of these but it's nice to have just in case, the bed was very comfortable and there was even an extra pillow in the drawers, the close proximity to union square was great, as Ruby Skye nightclub is just minutes away, this room was a great deal and I'm reasonably happy with it, the only negatives are that at 8am there were some homeless people in the alley outside the room (don't expect a view, unless you like looking at walls), who were making an obsene amount of noise, the pressure of the shower isn't all that great, but not bad, and the width of the hallway make it really hard to get around the maids since we checked out right at 12pm, overall I would definitely recommend the Adante hotel to anyone looking for a great price and a great location."
117,1994,"Oct 27 2004	Very incovenient check-in policy	It may be hard to find a cheaper room, but there are definitely some drawbacks on this one. One primary problem is that while check-in is at 3, and while the staff seems to be firm about that, they do not provide a secure place for you to leave your bag. I understand that this is not a luxury hotel, but is it a luxury to have a place to leave your bag? They offer a room on the first floor where you can stash it, but it is unlocked and everyone in the hotel then knows that. We had to walk around SF terrain with our luggage until precisely 3 and, on the day of our departure, were again laden with our bags. I highly doubt that we were the only ones for whom this was a problem and don't see why it couldn't be easily remedied by having the desk attendant walk over and unlock and relock the storage room door.And while I know that others have mentioned the murals, you have to see them to believe them. It is actually not so much the images (I can live with a tulip cart and an entire seascape on the wall's upper border) but the thickness and dinginess of paint. Our room also had an incredibly stained and disgusting ironing board which really did a lot to turn one off.The location of the Adante is great; the lobby looks nice; and there are worse case scenarios (actual bugs or theft or completely rude staff). But just know that if you're going to SF for anything other than marathon sightseeing (i.e. if you want to relax in your room at points during the day or have a romantic getaway) you'll be very depressed having to do so in the Adante."
118,1994,"Oct 13 2004	Great little hotel in excellent position	We stayed here for 3 nights during mid September 2004.We booked our room via an online accommodation website, and was a little concerned after reading some of the negative reviews here and in the Lonely Planet Guide. We were quite surprised and pleased with this location. Yeah, there are a few regular street bums and beggars in the area, but its nothing as bad as the big cities on the East Coast of the USA (i.e. Washington DC). Those with the usual street smarts should have no problems.We arrived late evening of the day of our check in to be told that they were over booked on our room, but proceeded to give us a complimentary upgrade to a king size suite for our first night which was excellent. The remaining two night were back in the actual room we had booked which was quite small, but hey, your in San Fran to experience the city, so our room was just for sleeping. The room was quite old and in need of a renovation overhaul, but it has been clevery disguised with a marine theme paint job and decor.Be forewarned that there is no air conditioning in the rooms, just ceiling fans.The staff were super friendly and there is a coffee shop/internet cafe sharing the lobby area. The breakfast is a bit ordinary, which donuts, muffins, juices and coffee on offer, but there are plenty of alternative eateries in the near area.There is a coin operated laundry across the street, but please note that there is a good chance that a &quot;local&quot; will come in a ask you for a &quot;donation&quot;.Taxis are easy to hail from the street, and its only about $7.60 from the hotel to the Pier 39 tourist area and the ferrys to Alcatraz. For the energetic, its a good walk, but the steep slopes can be quite challenging."
119,1994,"Sep 20 2004	the adante is secretly in the tenderloin!	beware - the adante is right on the border of the tenderloin, which for those of you not familiar with san fran, is the inner city ghetto (we are taking crack pipes and prostitutes). most websites (expedia, hotels.com etc) will tell you it is in union square. the hotel is actually about 4 or 5 blocks from union square, and if you walk one block south you will hit the tenderloin. the hotel itself was ok. the rooms are incredible small. they should be fine for 1 person, but were very cramped for 2. i should mention that the staff at the hotel was extremely friendly and accomidating. the explained the layout of the city and reccommended several sights and resturants etc. also, if you are in town on business (as we were), it is pretty conveniant to the financial district. i would definately not stay there again, but for some the hotel might be ok."
120,1994,"Sep 19 2004	Good location clean rooms friendly staff =Great value	The Adante was a great value for the price we paid($56). Yes, the rooms are small but they, along with the bathrooms, appear to be recently updated and are clean. Yes, there are homeless people in the area but there are homeless people all over town. This is not a bad area (two blocks away is) and although we are from a semi rural area we felt safe. There is $15 self parking two doors down. We drove and walked all over town. I thought the Geary Street location of the Adante was a great starting point for touring the city.  We also stayed at the Hyatt Embarcadero for our anniversary night. What a great view of the bay and what a hit on my wallet!"

I wanted to book the room and after persistent angry voice from the hotel personel DEMANDING the card number the person on the other end hang up on me. RUDE RUDE RUDE!!!! My husband called before me to acquire about the price and encouter as well some very nasty person on the other end. All well we did not stay in that place and that was probably the best thing we did on that trip considering other reviews on this site.Word of edvice to the owners of that place, hotels run based primarly on the good costumer service so get you [--] together."
2,1998,"Oct 20 2009 	Disgusting	Never stayed in such a dirty, moldy, disgusting place as this. If an earthquake hit the mold and damp crawling up the bathroom would hold this place up!! The towels were so thin it was impossible to dry with them. This place has to be seen to be believed, how health inspectors allow this place to operate is beyond me. Great location but with so many more hotels on Lombard Street I'd advise anyone to stay well away from this one. Our 13 year old suggested that sleeping on the streets might have been a better option. Need I say more!"
3,1998,"Aug 11 2009 	dirty lousy room stay away!	stayed in #218, nasty, dirty carpet and chairs, torn window screens, stained and dirty bath tub, towel rack torn out of the wall, this place has not been renovated since it was an econo-lodge from who knows when. paid $92 (with tax was $108) for 2 queen beds on a sunday night, way too much for such a dump. i've stayed at marina motel and america's best inn just up the road in the past, way cleaner and better value (both were full, which is why i settled) stay away from the alpha inn!"
4,1998,"Jul 27 2009 	Good Location Average Rooms Awful WiFi	Stayed in the hotel for 8 days after the end of a road trip. It was probably a bit long, but the airline was to blame for that. I like the location - close to cool parts of Chesnut and Union streets. The room we had was a decent size. Bed was comfortable enough but the pillows had certainly seen better days. Likewise, the towels all felt like they'd been washed beyond their life some time ago. Would also be nice if the guy at the front desk spoke English.If you need wireless Internet access during your stay, it would be best to avoid this motel. It's clearly been set up by overzealous IT geeks who think it's nice to have you need to constantly login to use it, and it dumps you out randomly every few minutes, requiring a new login to get you back online. And to top it off, once you do login, you get directed to the Alpha Inn web site, NOT to the site you were trying to visit! Massively frustrating!"
5,1998,"Jul 16 2009 	BEST BUDGET HOTEL IN SF! Book the suite!	I booked a suite for two nights in July. The location is incredible! Great restaurants all within walking distance, the Palace of Fine Arts is a short walk away and... it's located on Lombard! I've seen 2 complaints on this site about this hotel that I too noticed. 1) no A/C and 2) bad smell. First, you're in San Francisco - even the hottest days are bearable with no A/C. We stayed in July and with the windows opened and the fan blowing, it was quite comfortable. And the smell someone mention: it's the smell from the carpet... and it's only in the halls, not the room. I've stayed at well over a dozen budget hotels in this city, and this was by far the best. Be sure to book the suite. For just a few more bucks a night, you get a large room with a big bay window. We got a comfortable king size bed, a pull-out sofa, a fridge, a microwave, a coffeemaker and Comcast digital cable and free Wi-Fi! Only 2 real complaints from me: 1) no free breakfast and 2) the room I stayed in had no real window in the bathroom and it was a bit stuffy in there after a shower - there was an exhaust fan, though. The man I encountered in the office could not have been any nicer. Excellent stay! You will not find a better budget hotel in the city!"
6,1998,"Feb 6 2009	Great deal!Super location!	As a native san franciscan who lives out of town now but visits frequently,i find the alpha inn the best choice for me.It is a very convienient location right off the golden gate bridge on highwayway 101 close to downtown,the wharf,golden gate park and the beach.It has two building options,an older victorian style which i prefer especially the suites and a newer motel type w/ pool.Rooms are clean and neat.The staff are friendly and accomodating.It is steps away from several nice shopping and eating neighborhoods,( chestnut st. and union st.)and the beautiful marina and presidio.Take it from a local this is a good deal in s.f.

8,1998,"Dec 6 2008 	Not bad	It was an ok experience...the service was good (just that there was none in the lobby after 9 pm the lobby was on roadside....they showed up only in the morning.) The rooms were big and nice. They had a free parking space too. Bus stop is just outside the hotel for golden gate bridge and 1 block to 30 number bus which can take you to union square/chinatown, etc. so a good location .walsgreen just in front . ATMs and Banks 2-3 blocksNot bad for the price."
9,1998,"Aug 6 2008 	Smelly Building and No A/C!	This was not one of the best overnight places to stay in S.F.The building had a very bad smell, my husband described it as having &quot;an onion in a headlock&quot;. Luckily there was a Walgreens across the street and we were able to buy some disinfectant/air freshener spray. We stayed at this place because a representative from AAA recomended it. I have two small children and our room had large windows with no screens. I was very tense about having a toddler in this room because she kept wanting to look out the window. Also Lombard Street is very noisy at night making it hard to sleep.There was no A/C so the room was very stuffy. Another family we came with had no hot water in there room for about 20 minutes. There was no continental breakfast in the morning only coffee and juice.Our family was very disappointed and will never stay at this place again."
10,1998,"Jun 25 2008 	Horrible Customer Service!! Horrible room!!	My wife and I arrived the evening of June 13th only to find a hole in the ceiling of our room with water dripping from it. I went to the front desk to inform them of this and request another room. I was told flat out in a very rude tone that no more rooms were available and if I didn't want that room I should go somewhere else. I was also told that, for the rate I was paying, what did I expect!! Unbelievable!! I told them that the room was totally unacceptable and, since it was late and we didn't know the area at all, I asked if they would help us find another room. I was immediately told a flat out NO and that we should leave in a very rude tone again. After a very brief shouting match concerning their totaly lack of customer service, we left. Fortunately, we found an excellent room at the Chelsea Inn just a couple of blocks from where we started. They had fantasic large rooms and unbelievable Customer Service at only a few dollars more than the dingy, dirty Alpha Inn and Suites. Finally, we ended up getting a refund thru AOL@Travelocity after they called the Alpha Inn and Suites to confirm our complaint...."
11,1998,"Jun 7 2008 	Terrible	What a horrible experience!The room was very smelly, there were spider webs on walls and a hole in the celling with dust falling from it, the bathroom wasn't clean...Futhermore, the owner is not reliable AT ALL!! We booked the room many months before the trip, for 7 nights, but we had to cancel one night in the week. We called a few weeks before the trip and the owner told us the cancellation for this night was ok. At the check in, he kept tolding us that the cancellation wasn't possible and that we had to pay for the night even if we weren't there (and even if we called before). And we can't argue with him because he can't speak in english !! So we had to pay for his lie, in addition of a bad stay at this hotel.Don't go there... even for the &quot;low price&quot;. Find something else, pay a little more or stay at home!"
12,1998,"Dec 11 2007	Bed bugs bed bugs bed bugs!!!!!	Honestly, I understand trying to find a good budget hotel in SF. This place has a good location, but DO NOT GO!!! By time I got home the following day I had over 50 bites on my body. After visits to the doctor, allergist &amp; dermatologist, they were confirmed o be bed bugs and I spent MONTHS taking pills and applying cream to make them go away!! The management did not respond wen I tried to report the situation via email. Go anywhere else!!!!"
13,1998,"Oct 22 2007 	Comfortable stay	We stayed at the Alpha Inn and Suites (previously Econo Lodge) for 3 nights, and overall it wasn't bad! The guy on the front desk was friendly and helpful (even if English wasn't his first language), and he gave us a huge room, from which you could see downtown, Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz.The main building is accessed via a locked gated door which you access using your keycard. The room was clean and had a comfortable bed, walk-in cupboard, bathroom, TV, telephone, fridge, microwave, table and chairs, 2 sofas, and coffee maker. It was about 4 times the size of the hotel room my husband stayed in last time he was in SF. The noise wasn't too noticeable considering we were on Lombard Street! The main negative for us was that there was no safe, despite the website saying 'safe in every room' and the keycard saying 'keep your valuables in the safe'.Some other things to note:&gt; There's no lift  so make sure you can carry your luggage up and down 3 flights of stairs!&gt; Breakfast consisted of 1 small chocolate muffin. However, there's a Walgreens right across the road, and a diner further up Lombard.&gt; If you're not a fan of thin towels, bring your own!The area seemed fairly safe, and the location is good  just walk down Divisadero and you end up at the marina district. If you're feeling energetic you can have a very pleasant walk 2 miles to the Golden Gate Bridge (turn left), or Pier 39 (turn right). Having researched SF hotels on Tripadvisor, we weren't expecting to get a lot for our money (especially on Fri/Sat, booking only a few days before our stay). While the whole place would undoubtedly benefit from a spruce-up, we had a comfortable stay. However, if you're the kind of person whose holiday is ruined by chipped furniture/mismatched decor, I would recommend looking elsewhere..."
14,1998,"Oct 5 2006 	Horrible and stinking. DO NOT STAY THERE !!!	I booked this hotel through the Econo Lodge website after reading the reviews poted here. This hotel was TERRIBLE !!! There is no lobby, the parking is VERY limited and it is rather difficult to find a place on the street.I reserved a suite for about $110 (US dollars) and got an absolute dump (see the photos I have taken).Upon entering the building a strong disinfectant odor attacked us. This smell was also in the so called &quot;suite&quot;. There was no elavator and our room was located on the 4th floor ! I had to carry 3 large suitcases up the stairs ! The corridors and stairs were filthy, and one of the stairs made sounds and wiggled like it was going to fall off.The room was filthy. The rugs were torn and stained. The disinfectant smell was everywhere. The sofa-bed in the living room part of the &quot;suite&quot; was broken and you couldn't sit on it or open it into a bed (see the photos).We immediately went down to the reception desk and asked for another room. The clerk was rude and refused. He said he had no other rooms available due to a convention of some sort... I cannot imagine a convention accommodating its participants in this dump...Please take my advice and do not stay there, no matter the price. I paid a lot of money and got nothing in return.DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL !!!"
15,1998,"Aug 20 2006	Avoid at all costs!!	We called this hote at 5:30 pm and aksed if there were any rooms available. We were told there was one left at $139.00. We booked the room and gave the lady our credit card number. We told her we were driving into town and would be there around 8:00. After negotiating through downtown traffic, we arrived at the hotel at 8:20. We buzzed the door and an older man came to a small window. I gave him my name and said we had reservations for that night. He looked on a sheet of paper and said we were not on it and then turned around and walked back into the back room and would not come out again when I buzzed again. I returned to our car and my wife called the hotel. This same man answered the phone and told her that they had canceled our reservation because we were not there at 8:00. It was only 8:20!NEVER AGAI!!. People, read these reviews and heed the warning. This place is to be avoided."
16,1998,"Aug 10 2006 	Great Stay!	My husband and I stayed at this motel previously and had a good experience. This time was no different. We booked a king suite for one week. The room was very large and had a couch, arm chair, coffee table, small dining table and two chairs, microwave and refrigerator. The room also had cable TV and free high-speed internet. For summertime this place had the best price in the area and I booked several months ahead. It was clean, the staff was friendly, and the location is amazing. It is located about a 10 minute walk from the waterfront, 10 minute walk from the Palace of the Arts and 5 minute walk from the Presidio, 5 minute walk from Chestnut street restaurants and pubs and 5 minute walk to Union street shops. Parking does fill up quickly in the afternoon and most of the parking spaces are tiny but this was not a problem for us because we walked everywhere. A bus stop that is right in front of the motel will connect you to anywhere in the city. I dont have a single negative thing to say about the Econolodge, San Francisco."
17,1998,"May 29 2006	So much for service	Crappy service, rude employees, dirty musty broken down rooms and not enough parking. Can't get back any property accidently left, even if you ask them to send it postage due. Top it off with being overcharged. Don't stay here!"
18,1998,"Aug 23 2005	It was ok...	The room was good, big, big TV, high speed internet, very clean. I had to buy a Shampo, because they had a bad one. But for my next visit to SF (which I hope will happen soon) I'll go there again..."
19,1998,"Mar 8 2005	Basic	This is a budget hotel, make no bones about that. The pool was empty and had some work done recently. The room was clean and tidy and adequate for what I wanted. It is very near the 30 bus route to Fisherman's wharf and Downtown. In reach of the bay for walks along the Marina. Opoosite a 24 hr Walgreen's Drug Store for late night snacks!As an alternative there are plenty of other motel literally within 5 mins walk of this hotel. I should have tried them as an alternative.The traffic is quite noisy as Lombard St is en route to the Golden Gate Bridge"
20,1998,"Feb 16 2005	Does not Honour Online Booking	There is always a first time for everything -&gt; Refusal of Service.Arrived at 6:30PM at night, showed our web reservation printout and was asked for name three times before saying no reservation under the name. He takes a look at the web reservation sheet of ours and tells us that the rates are all wrong (too low). However, he was &quot;willing to accomodate&quot; and put us in a room although the hotel is &quot;full&quot;. Hands us a sheet with no explaination (apparently guest registration sheet), asked us to fill out information and sign first before he starts filling out the length of stay and room rates (which of course were higher than the web reservation). When I mentioned that the rates (only approx. 10 dollars more for two days in comparison to web reservation ) will not be accepted by us and that this is a problem he should take up with EconoLodge Headquarters, he said plain and simple &quot;...then go away, we don't serve you, you are rude, go away! Leave now!&quot; At no time were we rude. At no time did we agree to pay more regardless of the amount. We asked for the registration sheet to be torn up and he refused. Bottom Line:1. Poor Language Communication Skills (hard to understand his Enlish)2. Poor Attitude (at no time did he make a phone call/use a computer to verify the validity of our web reservation)3. Does not understand the concept of customer service Side Note: There are about 12 parking spots for &quot;big&quot; cars and about another 12 spots for compact cars (for compact cars, 2 inches from the mirror of each side for a Toyota Corolla is the space you are left with if you are confident enough to steer into that space)"
21,1998,"Dec 7 2004	Avoid	Was all set to say that this place is a good option for budget stay in SF, despite the central pool empty of water and filled with mud, crooked electrical outlets, and world's worst in-room coffee. Then, when I was checking out, I asked the owner if he could store my bags while I was out, and he refused to store them in the office. He said he could store them in the laundry room across the hotel complex. I asked him if he could show me where that was and he refused. When I said I was uncomfortable leaving the bags somewhere he would not show me, he tried to assure me that it was locked except when the employees were doing laundry (this did not seem all that secure). I asked again if he could store my bags in the office, and he refused, and then said, &quot;Now I won't store your bags at all.&quot; I said &quot;What?&quot; He said, &quot;Take your bags with you, I won't help you.&quot; We went back and forth like this a couple more times, until finally I had to beg him to take the bags, and even then, I had to lug the bag with my computer in it all around with me, since I decided only to leave my garment bag. In the end, the laundry room seemed semi-secure (although it was across the parking lot in the back, and it would have been easy for someone to take something out of a bag outside the sight of the manager or desk clerk). This owner does not understand that there is a minimum standard he has to provide; otherwise his hotel is all but useless to travelers."
22,1998,"Jul 4 2004	Location location location (Safe)	Stayed June '04 for 4 nights (2 Adults and 2 Teenagers). Never visited SF, LOCATION WAS THE KEY. AAA price $56 a night. We we able to park Free every night. Pool is being redone. Rooms clean, older but clean. Didn't spend much time in room, so this was ideal for a budget. Easy walk to Mel's Diner-A Must."
23,1998,"Apr 12 2004	Good for price but short on parking space	We stayed there on april of 2004. This is what we got for 48$us per night: King bed,mini fridge,coffee maker, fog horn noise from the Golden gate bridge, tight space or non-existent parking, and ghetto-like room neighbors. If you think about using the pool, DON'T. They should think about burrying it and putting more parking space over it. It was very dirty. The room was clean but had a strong smell of carpet deodorant floating around, but we vented it out quickly by opening the window. This is a good hotel for the budget-oriented traveller because of the cheap rates and because it's located in a good neighborhood (Cow's Hollow). You could access everything by using public transit, but much easier with a car.. Bring lots of quarters for metered parking when you visit the city!!!"
24,1998,Jul 24 2008	Bitte buchen Sie dieses Hotel unter keinen Umstnden!
1,1999,"Nov 9 2009 	Don't stay here	This place was horrible. It had a bad smell to it the paint was chipping in big clumps off the walls. There were spider webs in the room. Housekeeping does not do there job well. My tub still had hair in it from the last person and there was mold on the top of the tub. The next day I had to go get toliet paper and towels because they were not re-stocked. The manager acted like he could care less. My headboard was constently hitting the wall it was not nailed down. I complained but it wasen't fixed, and the best part is the toliet didn't flush well. The manager refused to give back any of my money and he still has money held on my card from check out. I wouldn't stay here again if somebody paid me to."
2,1999,"Oct 9 2009 	It's nothing special	Please get there at a decent time or you have to use some strange night check in window. It's a decent hotel for the price and it's close to Fisherman's Wharf and Golden Gate Bridge. We have stayed there everytime we travel to San Fran, only because other hotels can be pretty pricy."
3,1999,"Aug 28 2009 	Good but anonomous	This is one of many similar looking motels on Lombard street. It's convenient for the excellent MUNI public transport system, but please don't think you are near the famous &quot;Twisty&quot; bit of Lombard St. That's miles away.The service was good though with both the people I met on the front desk very helpful. Breakfast is machine coffee, machine juice and muffins. Think of it as a snack, not a way to start your day.Parking is first come first served but I never saw it full. I left mine parked there for 3 days to avoid parking fees elsewhere in city."
4,1999,"Aug 15 2009 	Good Value	Room was clean, staff was very friendly and helpful. No problem getting a late check-out. Location is decent for cruising the wharf- about 1.5 mile walk to the action, about 2 miles to Alcatraz Ferry. Never felt uncomfortable walking alone in the daytime, however I did not walk at night so don't know about that. I had a room close to Lombard so it was a bit noisy, but turning on the fan or AC effectively drowned that out. If you don't mind walking this is a great place to stay and save money by not renting a car."
5,1999,"Aug 7 2009 	Nice room cheap price great neighborhood	I went with my husband for 3 days, so we spent 2 nights there. The check-in was at 2pm, but we arrived from LA at 10am, so as we expected the room was not ready at all. The front desk employee offered us the laundry room to leave our luggage in order to take a walk in San Francisco. When we returned at 6pm after visiting Alcatraz jail, the room was ready. Not too big, but it had a king size, hot water, hairdryer, a TV. It was enough for us. The &quot;breakfast&quot; is very funny, you take the breakfast in the front desk area, next to the guests who are checking in or out. You only have coffee or tea and a few muffins. You take the breakfast stood up, no chairs, no table, nothing. However, the hotel is well ubicated. We took a tour and the tour bus passed through Lombard Street, we just went down in front of our hotel. Next to Lombard Street, it's Chestnut Ave. with a lot of restaurantes, cafes and shops."
6,1999,"Jul 27 2009 	Great Location - just watch for the shady character behind the desk	I made this reservation for my parents who were coming into town for just one night. One of the other reviews mentioned that the front-desk guy got angry about the price she paid on travelocity. I got a deal on priceline (all the other places nearby where going for $140 - high tourism season and we paid $100). This angered the man behind the counter and he made a big show of calling priceline, because he didn't want to honor the request. My folks are not easily upset and they let the guy get it out of his system and then asked for a nice, quiet room.I went into the room with them - very clean, nice, with a kitchenette. But it's in a section of town with a lot of night-life. Mom said the drunks stopped coming in around 4, and the travelers started leaving around 5.... not a lot of peaceful sleep for the folks. Not very quiet.Overall, the room was clean and comfortable for what they needed.... but there was almost no available parking (the Days Inn next door always seemed to have some spaces free - I'd recommend going there if you have a choice) - I had to park by my house, almost 7 blocks away.For single women - DO NOT travel here alone. That guy behind the desk is one weird dude."
7,1999,Jun 15 2009 	Terrible hotel! Very dirty!	I have never left a review before but I am doing so on this hotel. The hotel does not have complimentary parking or breakfast as advertised. The parking is first come first serve and the breakfast is a muffin and the most disgusting coffee I have ever tasted. I had to spit it out as soon as I tasted it! The bed linens were old and had not been washed in a very long time. They were full of hair and holes....I itched all night long. The beds were so uncomfortable I could not sleep. Please be aware that this hotel is not worth the discounted price. Pay a little more and be confident you are getting a cleaner room with amenities.
8,1999,"Apr 30 2009 	Friendly Staff Clean and Cheap...	I spent 3 nights here and it was a nice comfortable stay indeed. The first night was mediocre due to an issue with the bathroom, but once the manger was told he took care of it right away, and was very gracious and apologetic...one can't ask for more than that right? In fact the manager was extremely friendly and helpful to every guest with public transportation and sight-seeing tip, also he was great about helping me find late night parking when the hotel's on site lot was full...he awoke from his sleep when he heard me pull in late that night....now how nice was that? I would certainly stay here again above all other hotels in this price range, and have already referred a few others. Good luck and enjoy!"
9,1999,"Apr 29 2009 	Great Deal but avoid room 210	Just back from my stay in room 210. Nice room but the back wall (where your head sits on the pillow at bed time) sits right up against the outdoor seating for a bar called &quot;The Tipsy Pig&quot; that faces Chestnut Street. It is LOUD until about midnight or 1am. I just drank enough wine that sleep was easy. :) I would avoid 210 and probably 310 if that's the room above. The room was nice, the bed was VERY comfy and the staff was super helpful and pleasant. I would definitely stay here again. I did have one issue during my stay which was handled directly and immediately upon my reporting it. As for nearby things to do: Exit the hotel, and ignore the IHOP, and go north to Chestnut St. Plenty to eat, shop and do there. Also the bus to downtown, Little Italy and Chinatown stops here. To save a few bucks, pay the money for the microwave and refrigerator, then head to the Safeway in the Marina District (a nice walk thru the homes) and stock up on picnic supplies and breakfast items.) Grab a Muni pass at the Powell street cable car end of line and ride the cable cars and muni (bus and rail and street cars) to get around. Save TONS on cab fair and soak up some culture!"
10,1999,"Apr 19 2009 	Great Price and Location too much noise from outside though.....	Only paid $50 for 1 night, rooms was clean and great location, near the Golden Gate bridge ton of restaurants along Lombard St. and Fisherman's Dwarf. Our room faced the street side and you head every car that passed by as well as people talking in yhe car port.Overall great location and price."
11,1999,"Feb 22 2009 	good and not too expensive wonderful rooms on Lombard Street	we are from Germany and stayed here for 2 nights, the rooms are clean &amp; charming. There is a Bus stop to Fishermans Warf nearby and some good clubs and restarants around the corner. Thank You for the advice. The rates are low.For us a very good choise to stay some wonderful days in SF.[-]best regards Uli"
12,1999,Jan 5 2009 	First Rate Service	We had stayed at another hotel in this chain during our trip and was impressed. We found an America's Best Value Inn on our GPS and it looked to be in a good location and has off street parking. We made our reservation through America's Best Value Inn's main phone number. This one is within walking distance to The Presidio and MANY bars and restaurants. The rate was very low considering the location but what impressed us the most was the service. I have never received that level of service from a budget hotel/motel. Their staff will go to great lengths to make sure the guests are comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in San Francisco.
13,1999,"Nov 15 2008 	Best quality for money in area	I travel from out of state to work in this part of town once a month and have tried most of the budget hotels in this area. This is my favorite and if I get a good deal I stay here (price between the hotels fluctuate -- Travel Lodge Presidio, Greenwich Inn are also fine options). Rooms clean, staff helpful and it's in good location. Only drawback is that Lombard can be loud so try and get a room beyond the main court yard as traffic and loud passers by can be loud."
14,1999,"Oct 21 2008 	Perfect for our Budget	This was the cheapest hotel we could find in the city for the weekend. We were a little hesitant because of the prior reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised. We were able to check in very early, and by the time we came back from a long day, we still had a place to park. Maybe we got lucky, but even if it was full, there are places to park within walking distance and the metered parking is free after 10 p.m. There are plenty of places to eat, shop and walk to and feel safe. There is even a Walgreens right down the street. The room had all the amenities we needed, including a refrigerator. The only thing..the shower was a little tricky. We couldn't figure out how to turn it on and had to call the front desk. The front desk crew was very helpful, and we would definitely stay there again."
15,1999,"Oct 10 2008 	Good quality and good hospitality	The room is simple but it has everything you need: Good shower, good TV, wireless internet connection. The representative Hitesh was very kind and gave nice tips about the neighborhood."
16,1999,"Sep 14 2008 	It was really fantastic!	The owner was very nice and offered us a nice room for a fantastic rate! We stayed for two nights and went to see a lot of interesting places, which the hotelowner pointed out for us on a map of San Fransisco.The room was also very clean. And the bed slept fantastic."
17,1999,Sep 1 2008 	woderful stay	Its wonderful stay. I reach there early but they check in me and the front desk guy is with kind nature and helpful with soft spoken behavior to all the guest who want directions or any kind of help. I can say because I'm woman and traveling alone in the city and if somebody helps you have to appreciate that. room was very good and clean they change the sheet and towels everyday and I like most the SMOKING POLICY of this hotel If you smoked in the room you got charge. Nice Very Nice. location is perfect.
18,1999,"Aug 27 2008	Bed Bugs	Following a single night stay here, we woke up to find bug bites on our bodies and bed bugs on the mattress. These bugs tend to infest the areas they live in and can easily hide inside luggage or clothes you bring with you. We checked out and asked for a refund, but were denied. After calling the corporate office, they asked us to submit a formal complaint, but still refused to issue a refund.I've submitted complaints to the city health department...but for now, DO NOT STAY AT THIS MOTEL, by any means."
19,1999,"Jul 31 2008 	Perfect place on a budget	This place was perfect for us- It was a girls vacation: My daughter, granddaughter and me. The Inn's front desk was helpful and nice. Our room was clean and perfect for our stay-we only needed a place to store our luggage, a clean bathroom-shower and bed to sleep in at night. Our room was close to the road but we heard nothing once we closed the door. The location is perfect for catching the bus to go to all the sights and places SF has to offer- the only way to travel in SF. It was close to all the shops, pubs, markets and resturants. I would recommend it to anyone and stay there again."
20,1999,"Jul 16 2008 	Unfriendly arrogant front desk guy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good location!	This motel is in a good neigbourhood as regards restaurants, bars and transportation facilities. The rooms are simple but were clean. I am aware one can't expect much but the concierge is one of the most unfriendly people I have ever come across. I have to agree with the previous writers comments in that the front desk guy comes across as sneaky/shady/unfriendly/very arrogant. Try get a booking through an online booking service as it is likely going to be cheaper than booking directly at the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to the budget traveller for its good location, however should one require good service, stay clear."
21,1999,"Jul 13 2008 	RUDE lying SNEAKY hotel guy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	This is the worst experience I have ever had a hotel. I traveled alone to Frisco to see some friends... The tall (6'3&quot;), skinny, middle-eastern guy at the front desk was the WORST. (I describe him, b/c I don't remember his name and I want you to avoid him and this hotel!) When I checked in alone, he was kind to me. When I told him I was staying in the room alone for the weekend, he looked at me with the most evil RAPIST eyes I've ever seen. He asked me how much I paid for my tickets on Travelocity, when I told him he got mad... I guess I paid too little for his liking. This guy is the only one that works at the hotel day and night... he was watching me come and go and asking odd questions. The worst part was when he saw me with my male friend in the morning... I took my friend back to my room mid-day after lunch to relax. He accused me of lying about being in my room alone, and while we were out he de-activated my room card, so I couldn't get back in... He also searched my room and found some tobacco in one of my bags and laid it out on the table... When we came back and my card would not let me in the room I had to go to him... he said he would re-activate the card and that HE MUST let me in himself... when he did, he barged in the room, pointed to the tobacco and accused me of smoking in a non-smoking room. Then, he started yelling at me, and he charged my credit card $250 for smoking... which apparently was in the fine print of the contract. I left a day early and will never return. PLEASE, DO NOT TRAVEL ALONE HERE IF YOU ARE A WOMAN.PLEASE, DO NOT USE THIS HOTEL."
22,1999,"Jun 2 2008 	Keep your expectations low.	Booked this hotel from New Zealand and were a little nervous after reading some bad reviews but when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised with the place. We had no car so had no problems with parking, although I think that probably not the best place for those with cars. Bed was big and comfortable, although the room had no extra amenities like fridge kettle etc. Bathroom was clean and shower was good, and TV service was great. Located in a great part of town close to Fisherman's Wharf and great restaurants. Also perfectly situated for those who are game enough to use public transport. Buses run frequently from almost directly outside to many parts of town including Haight, and the park and bridge etc. Probably more recommended for younger budget travellers and those with an open mind. As I said, keep your expectations low and you wont be disappointed.PS.. avoid the breakfast (a small prepackaged Danish) and head to ihop across the road. The stuffed french toast is mint."
23,1999,"May 25 2008 	Perfectly acceptable	I got a very good price for a one night stay at this hotel, especially considering my stay was in the middle of the Memorial Day weekend. It's an older property, and that shows. Furniture shows wear. However, the room was sparkling clean, all the windows were new and fit well. There was a small refrigerator in the room, but no coffee maker. Oh well, I can live with that. Plenty of channels on the TV. My room was at the back of the property, and I think I had no neighbors, so my stay was very quiet -- except for someone who marched loudly down the outside walkway at 3:00 a.m.! Can't blame the management for that, though. The managers were friendly, efficient and courteous. Parking is limited, but again that was no problem. There are several breakfast restaurants within a block of the motel, so that worked well for me. Location is good, a block away from a very nice part of Chestnut Street in the Marina where you can find several good restaurants, as well as two movie theaters. The Presidio is nearby, and there are plenty of buses to take you wherever you want to go in the City. I would certainly stay here again."
24,1999,"May 25 2008 	Bad Parking and Lame Breakfast	We were in San Francisco only for a couple of nights for the Oysterfest. Unfortunately, most of the other hotels in the area we wanted were all booked and we didn't want to pay an arm and a leg, so we stayed here. The parking situation is pretty bad, as noted by others. Spaces are small and there aren't enough for everyone. Breakfast was a joke--a lame little packaged danish and coffee. We ended up at IHOP across the street. The room itself was okay, but it didn't have that &quot;clean&quot; feel to me. It just didn't seem like it had been thoroughly cleaned and I didn't feel like I could walk around barefooted. It was okay, but nothing to write home about."
25,1999,"May 11 2008 	UNBELIEVABLE Experience!	This is the review that Expedia WOULDN'T let me post:My wife and I booked this place through Expedia. We chose it for its proximity to Fisherman's Wharf and the free parking on site.When we arrived, we found out that the free parking was limited to about the first ten cars or so, and everyone else would have to park tandem and leave ther keys at the front desk.So far, no biggie -- we had a rental car. We were assigned room 218, which according to the elevator is on the THIRD floor. (We'll use that as benchmark warning for all hotels in the future.)The room was servicable, and I decided to plonk down on the bed for a quick nap before we hit the town.I pulled the sheets back, and dropped down into a recent PUDDLE of undetermined liquid on the mattress! (Yes, it was at crotch level, and we came to the same conclusion as to its origin.)We called the front desk and a maid arrived promptly. She surveyed the situation and called the front desk for further assistance.A man arrived shortly therafter, surveyed the situation, and asked me -- accusingly -- &quot;WHAT DID YOU DO?&quot;I set him straight, and they proceeded to strip the bed, and then they FLIPPED the soaking wet mattress OVER, so that the wetness would be the problem of room 118 (on the second floor).By this time we were on the phone to Expedia, demanding to change our hotel. Expedia said they would find us a room at another hotel OWNED BY THE SAME GUY, but we declined, as not changing the sheets between guests would seem to be an ownership problem.We we returned home, and tried to post this review to Expedia, we discovered that we weren't the first people to discover that this property didn't always change sheets between guests, but we may have been the first to discover a fresh &quot;puddle&quot; of evidence!"
26,1999,"Jan 14 2008 	Great price great location friendly informative staff and clean room!	My wife and I wanted a comfortable, reasonably priced , clean room, in a location handy to public transportation, restaurants and points of interest. This budget hotel fulfilled our requirements perfectly with a very clean room and king sized bed. Everything worked to our satisfaction including a very quiet efficient heater. The staff was helpful and informative. We stayed 3 evenings and would highly recommend this hotel. We will gladly stay again on our next trip to San Francisco."
27,1999,"Dec 15 2007 	Good for one short night	We would not have chosen to stay at this hotel but the Days Inn a few doors down was remodeling and could not honor our reservation for a room with two beds. The office staff did give us a room at the same discounted AAA rate but I wonder if they got the best of the deal. The room was small and did not include a coffee maker, 'fridge, or microwave. The room and the bathroom were clean. Breakfast consisted of coffee and a prepackaged Danish. Since we checked in late and were leaving early, the room was okay for us. I would not have wanted to stay there for an extended vacation. The hotel is handy to many S.F. sites and included free parking if your vehicle is small enough for their spaces. The Day's Inn allowed us to park our extended cab pickup at their facility; otherwise we would have had to park on the street."
28,1999,Oct 29 2007 	America's Best Dumpy Inn!	The pictures on the hotel website have obviously been staged. The room we stayed in was dirty and dated. The traffic noise on Lombard was enough to keep a bear in december awake; not to mention the horrible slamming of the elevator door every 15 min. throughout the night. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is interested in a clean and quiet space.
29,1999,"Oct 18 2007	We were very pleased!	I was a litle nervous about what kind of place we would be staying based on some of the other reviews I read, but we were very pleased once we got there. First of all, you can't go expecting a 5-star hotel or you will be disappointed. Be realistic!! We checked in with no problems. The room was very clean and was straightened daily. The location was perfect for us. We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go and there are lots of good restaurants very close to the hotel. The staff was very nice and helpful. My only complaints were that you can not make local phone calls from the room which meant we had to use our cell phones (this meant roaming charges for us). There were some electrical outlets that didn't work and there is only one small shelf in the bathroom. Overall, I would definately stay here again and do highly recommend it to any one who just wants a clean, comfortable place to sleep and shower."
30,1999,"Aug 8 2007 	Not Good	The good: new clean bathroom, beds, quiet between 11 p.m. - 7 a.m., IHOP across the road, the price (? by san francisco standards), quiet air con/fan unitThe not so good: no in-room coffee maker, smallish room, no desk, phone message light continually flashed, hotel looked shabby, the &quot;lite continental breakfast&quot; was definitely &quot;lite&quot; (coffee and a sweet roll), had to get the tv remote from office.The bad: animal hospital adjacent (dogs barking at 7:30 a.m.), hotel refused to store our bags for 3 hours after we checked out as we had a flight in the late p.m. (never had that happen before), windows and walls were thin (traffic and people noise).The conclusion: you get what you pay for."
31,1999,"Apr 21 2007	Be Aware	I had three days to visit San Francisco and I booked this hotel on-line previous research on the web site.Result:No breakfast area nor Complimentary Continental BreakfastNo refrigerator,microwave or coffee maker as indicatedDirty Room -towels,sheets,blankets includedAsked to have clean stuff...probably they don't have clean stuff at all...Complimentary Parking...if you're lucky to find a spotNoise coming from the street &quot;horrible&quot;Some guests checked-in at 9.00 p.m., they ran and screamed all over the place 'til midnight...I called the owner and he ignored me..Called 911 they showed up an hour later.You want to go to San Francisco...pick something else..for the same price too..."
32,1999,Oct 14 2006 	Could be worse	Our hotel in the city cancelled at the last second and this was only one of two rooms available. Definately not worth $175/night. The Good: great location - excellent for walking and taking the bus ($40 cab from the airport). The bathroom was renovated and very clean. Our smoking room did not smell. The best breakfast in the city is across the street (Home Plate).The bad: no amenities - esp at $175 a night. Make sure you check for TP before you use the bathroom. This seems to be a common problem.
33,1999,"Oct 2 2006 	Terrible dirty but free parking	We were looking for a place with free parking because we had read on the internet how expensive parking could be in San Francisco. This is definitely a case of &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; $63 a night.We were traveling from South Carolina and spent my birthday here...the worse hotel I have ever stayed...but the parking was free. The room was dirty, hair on the pillows. Cigarette burns on the furniture and blanket. Shower curtain was filthy. However to their defense...they were renovating and hopefully all of the rooms are going to be completely redone. We were warned re: renovation noise, etc. Be advised of the above and check the room prior to making a decision."
34,1999,"Aug 27 2006 	Nightmare Rip Off	8:30 on a Saturday evening in August and after having our reservations not honored at another establishment, we were stuck. This motel was the only one with a vacant sign still lit. The proprietor said that only one room was left and that it would cost us $175.00. Not having any choice other than sleeping in the car, we agreed. When my wife pulled out the credit card, she was asked to pay in cash instead, which we refused. Now about the room. There were two beds and a cabinet with a TV AND THAT WAS ALL! No tableNo chairsNo mirrorNo toilet paperNo waste basketNo cupsNo remote for the TVOne towel and wash clothThe carpets were still wet from being recently shampooed and the room smelled like cleaning products to the point of nauseousness. We had to sleep with the windows open on this very busy and noisy street. The lesson we learned - If your stuck in San Francisco with no room on a Saturday night, drive across the bridge and find an honest hotel farther north. It might be a late night, but at least you'll get some sleep and pay fair prices."
35,1999,"Aug 17 2006 	You get what you pay for	Yes this place is incredibly cheap, but then you actually have to stay here.The room and particularly the bath were very small. Towels were tiny and rough to the touch. We had booked this to avoid driving an hour home after a late night event and ended up deciding to drive home anyway. Location is pretty good - very close to the Marina and Cow Hollow, but don't expect anything more than a safe place to crash. Make lots of plans to be out of your room if you decide to stay here. Good news is you'll have plenty of cash left over. :)"
36,1999,"Dec 10 2003	Nice accommodations in S.F. for $44 per night	I weas a bit wary of the Sea Captains Motel on Lombard St. as I had read a couple of negative reviews, but I wanted to spend a few days in S.F. and was traveling on a tight budget. Let me tell you, for $44 per night (plus tax, of course), you get a clean and spacious room with a clean and spacious bathroom and a TV with cable. I'm sure you could spend 3x the rate and get about the same thing in the same neighborhood, which is the Marina- a clean and safe area of the City. If you get a room toward the rear of the motel, the traffic noise from Lombard is not bad at all. And the staff was pleasant enough, despite allegations of rude treatment of guests in other reviews. And there's a Safeway grocery about a 1/2 mile walk away and frequent bus service on Lomabard and Chestnut Sts. to all parts of the City."
37,1999,"Sep 16 2003	stop shouting!	We had some info on this motel from another source and decided to give it a try. Having lived some years in SF I knew Lombard St. might not be ideal, but since we had a car the free parking was enticing, and free breakfast was mentioned... all in all maybe a good deal.WRONG! The staff was continually berating us and others including shouting matches long into the night that even drowned out the horrendous traffic.Breakfast was 1 old cello-wrapped danish per person distributed like in maximum security and some WMD coffee.The parking lot was floodlit to the point you could read in bed all night even with curtains drawn.verdict: double plus ungood."
38,1999,Jul 18 2009 	Trop bruyant. Petit djeuner  revoir. Bon emplacement.
39,1999,Apr 30 2009 	Bien sans plus

1,2000,Oct 9 2009 	Hotel screams BUDGET in quality	My friend and I took a cross country trip
2,2000,Oct 8 2009 	A good budget hotel.	This is a value/budget(2 star) facility. Knowing this in advance will let you have reasonable expectations. The neighborhood is not the best-it's somewhat run down with numerous homeless people on the streets (in all 5 days we were there we were not bothered/harassed by the homeles @ all). if you're from a big city or have vacationed in a big city
3,2000,Oct 8 2009 	Americas WORST Value Inn 	This hotel is great if you don't mind other people's pubic hairs in your shower

6,2000,Oct 6 2008 	very good location. good rooms. nice breakfast.	a very nice hotel
7,2000,Sep 30 2008 	Great new addition to SOMA budget hotel choice.	We usually stay at the Best Western or HoJo Express on Market Street (now Vagabond Inn) - but gave this new hotel a try based on price and website plus TA reviews. Great Choice. Lobby is modern and clean with friendly
8,2000,Aug 31 2008	good deal	Clean and convenient. Ten minutes walk from market street. coffee and muffins for breakfast
9,2000,Oct 24 2007 	Great place / Reasonable price	There are quite a few hotels in San Francisco - and hotels with parking area is a plus!! The hotel has 2 location and I went to the one in Lombard St. - The location is perfect and if you wish and like walking - it is walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf (that in itself saved me money for parking area) specially that part of the tourist attraction - Close to the beach. :)The outside is not much and deceiving - Rooms are clean
10,2000,Oct 20 2007	Perfectly good	I was very wary after reading the first review below
11,2000,Sep 17 2007 	Great Place and value	Me and 2 friends flew in on the 7th and the front desk checked us in very fast and was curteous. The palce used to be called the globe hostel and the only sign showing that it was americas best value inn was a banner in the window
12,2000,Aug 22 2007 	A Hotel Experience to Forget	NOTHING IS ACCEPTABLE at this hotel
13,2000,Jan 13 2009 	Très moyen		
1,2001,Sep 14 2009 	Ok for one night but no more..	Location is too far to walk to fishermanns warf.Not enough parking space at motel.Quite noise from street in front hotel.Kingbeds are really smallQuite clean.There are better hotels
2,2001,"Aug 18 2007 	You get what you pay for.	I dont understand how and why people get upset when they pay such a low rate for a hotel and expect so much. My experience at the Garland Hotel was rather charming. Sure, its not in the best part of town, but even many other nicer hotels are only 1 block away. I was travellin on a budget and this hotel met all of my needs.The room was comfortable and clean, and although the TV was rather small the hotel staff was polite and made up for it. I would definitely suggest the Garland to other travelers looking to stay in San Francisco without breaking the bank."
3,2001,"Oct 27 2006 	Avoid staying in this Hotel	They have some nice photos on their webpage, hence, I thought the hotel is okay (&quot;also for business travelers&quot;). Normally, you get what you pay for and I haven't expected much comfort. However, this hotel was a nightmare. The stairs, elevator and the floors have been extremely dirty and smelly. Many guests were drunk all the time, one guy managed it to vomit on the stairs every night, and the staff didn't wipe it up before midday. The room itself was okay (some quite new furniture and a fridge). Even in San Francisco you should easily find a better hotel for that price."
4,2001,"Jul 10 2005	avoid at all costs!	The Photo of the Garland looked OK, and it was cheap, so we booked to stay for 5 nights from June 23rd.The 'foyer' was filthy, smelly and was full of flies. It was our first trip to the USA, it was 7.30 in the evening, we didn't know what to do. We thought that the room couldn't be that bad so we booked in.We were wrong. On our way to the room we noticed that many of the doors appeared to have been 'forced' and had had hasty repairs carried out.The door to our room was of a flimsy 'interior' type, not what you would expect in a hotel, e.g. fireproof. The room was cramped, dirty and smelly. My husband tried to open a window, this caused it to crack. The bath and sink were full of hair. There was one towel.We were terrified. There was no way we could stay there, we would have been frightened to leave our belongings in such a place. (I forgot to mention, there was also loud music blasting from a nearby room).We left our suitcases, took what we could carry, and found a decent hotel nearby. Be warned."
5,2001,"Apr 17 2005	Poor condition bad neighborhood..however close to UNION SQ and CHEAP.	Probably my worst hotel experience ever...let me tell you how it went. Well, ivisited the website and it looked fancy and really nice but... when i arrived, it was old, all the stairs creaked and were uneven, the elevator had duct-taped doors (because it was shattered), paints chipped on all surfaces, bedroom windows have no screens (even on 5th and 6th stories up) -NOT SAFE! Nor do they close all the way or lock, tv has at most 3 channels that work. I was also given used toilet paper. The grossest thing was when i found hair on every towel (luckily i had my own in my trunk) and the blankets smelled like cigarettes. Not to mention the bad neighborhood although the HILTON is 2 blocks down as well as Union square. It kinda felt like those apartments from the movie THE PUNISHER. If you have children, be smart, pay a lil more and get a family friendly hotel with service. Also, there were no phones in the rooms. What if theres an emergency or fire?! Will the walls echo my yelling? Needless to say, i slept with my towel over the pillow and on top of my own beach blanket that i always keep in my trunk...cuz you'll just never know when youll need it."
6,2001,Nov 10 2009 	??????????????
1,2002,"Oct 25 2009 	Don't do it. Keep Distance from this hotel	This hotel is horrible. Filthy floor. Breakfast does not exist. the receptionist was rude.And when we thought things could not get worse, our car was broken into by a thief.We had a great loss and no assistance from the hotel. The receptionist just kept saying that they had no responsibility for the parked cars.No one apologized or offered any compensation for what happened.We lost almost the whole day solving the problem..We were not even warned about the burglary of the car. Almost 10% of our vacation was lost because the parking lot does not have a simple camera. Take a look about crimes in San Francisco? Why they don't have cameras?"
2,2002,"Aug 5 2009 	Not a pleasant place to come to at day's end	We discovered Trip Advisor after choosing this hotel from a guide book. The motel is run down with old mattresses stuck in the back corridors. Dark, gloomy and shoddy. It has location going for it but there are much better choices in the area."
3,2002,Jul 28 2009 	House of Horrors	Room smelled. Dirty. Blood on bedspread. Free breakfast consisted of coffee &amp; donut. Balcony was paper thin in some places- thought I was going to fall through. Avoid this place at ALL costs
4,2002,"Jul 22 2009 	Great Location Tired Property	This property was in a great location and it had free parking. It was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. We left our car (it was safe) there during our four day stay and walked to all the great sites. The bus was close to take us to the Golden Gate Bridge. There were several great restaurants just three blocks away from the Warf. The towels were thin and rough, being on a busy street made for a noisy stay. Upon our return, we will stay here again and would recommend this motel to you if you are looking for a good location to the Fishermans Warf. We will bring our own towels next time.We selected this property for its location, great price, free parking."
5,2002,"Jul 2 2009 	America's worst inn	The staff were very unhelpful and most didn't have a good grasp of English. We stayed for three nights and the second night the room wasn't cleaned, and on the day it was 'cleaned' the used polystyrene coffee cups were placed back on the coffee maker upside down complete with coffee stains. The room was filthy around the edges and under the bed. We had acquired the room at a reasonable rate and didn't expect luxuries but we did expect a clean room. However, the location was good and it had free parking and a lift. The wireless internet was useless and 'continental breakfast' was a coffee and a muffin/doughnut. Other guests were very noisy late at night/early morning. We complained again on checking out but were told by the receptionist there was nothing she could do. The person behind us in the queue to check out agreed how awful it was. I wouldn't say there again. Having spent a month in the States staying in various hotels and motels this was certainly the worst we encountered."
6,2002,"Jun 11 2009 	Great Bargain and Great Location	I had read the reviews prior to staying at this hotel and I was pleasantly surprised during our stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were nothing fancy, but very clean (no over-powering smells). I felt completely comfortable. Other hotels cost 2-3 times as much or more. This one offered free parking which elsewhere cost $25-$45 a night. The parking is cramped and if you must double park you have to leave your keys with the front. desk. It worked out better than expected and they never had to move our car. Breakfast was delicious muffins and doughnuts along with coffee. They did not offer plates or much of an area to eat. They request you gather your food and take it back to your room. The location is superb. It is within walking distance to Fishermans Wharf and &quot;The Crookedest Street&quot;. There is a grocery store and Starbucks not too far away as well. There is some street noise at night, but your in the middle of an active city. It wasn't too bad."
7,2002,"May 22 2009 	The carpet was soaked in urine	We booked their &quot;family&quot; suite which essentially consists of two double beds and a sofa. It had a microwave but was disgusting inside. By the time we unloaded everything, all three of our children who can rough it with the best of em looked me straight in the eye and told me they would rather sleep cramped in the car then stay in the room. The room smelled so badly of urine it burned our eyes. When we picked luggage off of the floor it was wet and smelled. When we told the attendant downstairs about the smell, he said he would give us an air freshener. REALLY? My husband insisted he move us but neither of the two other rooms would adequately hold all 5 of us. We checked them out and one of them happened to be up above the original room and the smell of urine was coming through the vents. The third one was one double bed - no way were my children sleeping on the floor when I wasnt confident they were clean. the bed spread in the last one had a large hole in the comforter the size of a dinner plate. We insisted on getting our money back and drove around for over an hour and half trying to find another place. We finally gave up and was headed further up north toward home and stopped in Marin county and stayed at a really really nice place that was truly a suite for only $20 more a night. Our kids were thrilled. We weren't in the heart of San Fran but our stay was 1000% better than it would have been if we had stayed at this hotel. No thank you!"
8,2002,"Sep 24 2008 	Not recommended	I felt I needed to post this review to warn others that this motel is not very clean( among other things) especially room 215. I stayed one night in 215. I awoke in the morning to see ROACHES crawling out of the vents in the microwave, they were also on the wall. I don't even want to think about where else they were crawling while I was asleep. This is just one thing. When I arrived, having reserved 2 roooms 4 months prior, the girl at the front desk had knowledge of only one room being held. I had reserved 2 rooms for 4 days and had luckly made arrangements for rooms next to each other for the 2nd day as my mother and I were at opposite ends of the motel. I was able the get out of the roach room.. Number 215 also had a door key system that did not work, locked me out of the room every time I closed the door, I had to go to the front desk 3 times to have them reprogram my key. The room was so dark I could hardly see in the bathroom. The toilet overflowed, which must happpen frequently as there was a plunged next to the toilet. The shower leaked onto the floor and flooded out the bathroom, I had to used all the towels to clean the floor. The girl at the front desk during the day could absolutely care less about customer service, even when told of the roaches in the room. There is a very nice and helpful man at the desk in the evening the only good thing about the motel. I left a note at the front desk regarding all of the above but have no way of knowing if anyone ever saw it or even cared."
9,2002,"Sep 2 2008 	Rude A-Hole wouldn't honour my reservation (booked 2 months ahead)	I arrived on a Thursday night for a 4 night stay. I had reserved a room 2 months in advance.When I arrived the rude a-hole at the desk first tried to tell me that I wasn't even in the system. Then once I showed him the print out that confirmed the reservation, he said that he had no rooms.I asked him what the point of giving him my credit card info and reserving ahead of time was, and he said that I had cancelled my reservation before by telephone.When I told him that I had not cancelled by telephone, he said that I had cancelled by internet. When I asked him why I never received an email confirmation of the cancellation, he told me that it didn't matter. I had cancelled by either telephone or email or something and that another hotel of his down the street would honour my reservation and rates. Then he told me to leave.I went down the street to the other hotel, and the gentleman there said that he didn't even know what I was talking about and that he would not honour my reservation and that he wanted $160 + tax in CASH, with 4 nights upfront. My reserved rate at the original hotel was $115 + tax so I was a little upset.He showed me the room he had and it smelled badly of puke. I told him that there was no way I was paying $160 + tax in cash for a room that smelled like puke. He then said $140 + tax / night in Cash. I told him to [--] and left.I ended up crashing on the floor of my buddies' room for that night.Magically the next day, the original hotel found me a room with 1 King Size instead of 2 Queens. I begrudgingly took it, but make no mistake, these guys are a-holes with no integrity. They will not honour your reservation, no matter how far ahead you book it, if they get a better offer.BEWARE!!!Other than that, the King Size room I got was fine for the price. It would have been even better if I didn't have to deal with a rude [--] at the counter and didn't have to sleep on the floor after spending hours looking for a room the night before.The girl who set me up with a room on the second day seemed nice enough though, but she still wasn't much help."
10,2002,"Jul 18 2008 	Hidden Gem	Who knew such an inexpensive quaint little motel would be tucked blocks from Fisherman's Wharf? What we got for $70 a night: clean comfortable bed (better than some high-priced hotels), bus stops on the corner, free off-street parking, free wireless Internet, microwave and refrigerator. Staff was friendly and helpful. An adequate continental breakfast of pastries and fruit was enough to get you going. I would have preferred a coffee maker in the room instead of in the lobby. Even though it is only 3 stories, there was a working elevator. As we were checking out, my husband pointed out that we had a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. I thought he was joking, but a section was visible from the 3rd floor balcony! We had not seen it before because of the ever-present fog.I highly recommend this motel. We stayed 4 nights here for what one night would cost at Fisherman's Wharf."
11,2002,Dec 24 2007	Brilliant location	Ok hotel in a fantastic location. Great place to stay and use as a base for exploring San Francisco. the hotel was clean and comfortable but nothing fancy. Good value but basic.
12,2002,"Aug 5 2007 	great location	Room was clean and tidy with good furnishing but not large. Parking is cramped so you leave the keys at reception so they can move your can if necessary, this was fine. The best thing is the location and price. We strolled down lombard street (curly bit) and onto pier 39 and it took about 20 mins of walking. The breakfast is coffee/tea and doughnut/muffin, fine for a quick bite and morning drink before heading off."
13,2002,"Aug 2 2007	Thanks to Mona	We were going there for my son's wedding and had a car so the free parking was great. The location was equally great and Mona, the desk clerk, was who my boyfriend talked to on the phone initally, was great. She was helpful with directions, local transportation and maps to help us with our first time in San Francisco. The room was sufficient with a refrigerator and microwave, which we never used as we were close to great resturants. We'd go there again as the price was very affordable."
14,2002,"Jul 23 2007 	Nice location	Ok hotel, excellent location, great price... enjoyed my stay here. Only a 7 minute walk to Fisherman's wharf, and a very nice staff. Nice rooms with lots of cable channels... Only bad thing was that the light switches would not work upon returning from the day. Called up front, they sent a man to fix it within minutes, but never got them working. At least the lamps worked! But other than that it was a pleasant stay and very convenient (we never had to take the car out!)"
15,2002,"Oct 2 2005	Worst Service Ever	Hotel has a good location, nice sized rooms, well maintained, clean, free parking. The owners have obviously invested a lot in the hotel (considerating its location). So, why after all that, would you hire the worst desk clerks ever? Upon check in, the first clerk initially refused to give me two (plastic keycard-type) keys to the room. When I persisted (repeatedly and emphatically), he finally gave me two keys.The night desk clerk was the worst, though. I wanted to get rid of some coins I'd accumulated, so I asked for dollars instead. He would only do this for ONE dollar. He said rudely, &quot;I don't need any more change.&quot; I asked if he would do it as a customer service, even if he didn't need the change. He rudely just said, &quot;No.&quot;The same night desk clerk refused to give me extra towels. Absolutely unbelievable.When I asked to speak with the manager to try to get more towels, the rude clerk said the manager wasn't there. When I asked him to call the manager (who was probably living on the property, as many hotel managers do), he said he didn't have the phone number.Needless to say, I wouldn't stay there again. Any hotel that would tolerate its customers being treated that way doesn't deserve my business."
16,2002,"Sep 7 2005	I would definitely NOT stay here again!	I would definitely NOT stay here again. The walls were paper thin, the beds very uncomfortable, the bathroom smelled like urine, the coffee maker was dirty, the room was very cramped, and the dcor very dreary and dated. On top of all that, it was not inexpensive at $134 a night for Labor Day weekend 2005. The only plus was the location close to the Wharf and free parking."
17,2002,Mar 19 2005	Not Bad	We spent 2 nights here in mid- March. Not as bad as the reviews had me expecting. The rooms are basic but fairly clean. Motel staff were very helpful; quickly providing additional pillows and a missing chair from my room(??) . Very good coffee in the motel lobby in the morning.  I would likely find a hotel more on the outskirts of the city next time.....and then use public transportation rather than renting a car. Parking is just impossible in San Francisco! Weekly or daily passes for the public systems are very affordable.
18,2002,"Feb 24 2005	Great Value	I'm writing this review from the Best Inn Hotelon the corner of Chestnut &amp; Van Ness here in San Francisco. After reading the reviews from websites I was skeptical about coming here. On average, this hotel had only been rated at about a 60% recommendation rate. It's obviously not the Hilton or the Fairmont, but if you are looking for a place to stay for a great price, this place is for you. Our room (on the 2nd level) is completely renovated, has Free High-Speed Internet, a new 27&quot; TV, new furniture, and is extremely clean. The rooms are all equipped with an ironing board and hair dryer, soaps and shampoos, we got a free breakfast, and FREE parking with in and out privileges. The parking lot is really crammed, so there is double parking. Just to be safe, you want to make sure that you check in early in the daytime (before 4pm) to ensure you get a parking spot. The staff was friendly, and they gladly accepted the coupon (that we got in a Travel booklet from Dennys) that have us the room for $49- No hesitations. We walked to Fishermans Wharf in 10 minutes, and we were at Pier 39 in 15 mins, cant ask for a better location. My only caution is to those who are light sleepers. There is a lot of traffic on the street, and since the hotel is shaped like a U, the noise gets trapped in easily. I requested a wake up call, turned the clock radio on an easy listening radio station and slept like a log. It looks rough from the outside, but its worth a shot. In fact, the staff encouraged us to look at the room before we booked it. I will return to this hotel for sure."
19,2002,"Nov 6 2004	horrible avoid at all costs	The room, especially the bathroom was filthy. The service was terrible, we had no light in the bathroom and was told we had to wait until the next day for someone to look at it. The toilet backed up. There were bums picking through garbage in the parking lot. I had cigerette burn holes in my sheet. It was VERY loud due to traffic. They missed giving us our wakeup call by one hour. I could go on and on. Best to avoid this hotel at all costs, the savings aren't worth it."
20,2002,"May 27 2004	Good bargain	It's a bargain for $65 weekday night plus tax for single bed room. Surcharge $20 for weekend. Popular with European tourists. Motor inn layout, 3 storeys, elevator, free parking. Excellent location: 10min brisk walk to Ghirardelli Square, 15min to Fisherman's Wharf. Helpful front desk staff. Provides soap, shampoo, lotion, coffee maker, hairdryer, iron and board, microwave, refrigerator, room clock, air-conditioning, coffee and tea whole day at lobby, free muffins and danish for breakfast. Only problem was the traffic noise: it is on Van Ness Ave, next to traffic lights - the starting and stopping of vehicles (especially buses) create a lot of noise. Light sleepers beware! Ask for rooms at the rear."
21,2002,Sep 20 2009 	Buon rapporto qualit prezzo e buona posizione

1,2006,"Will be staying here again soon!	I travel to San Francisco every other week for business. I like to switch my stays up between Union Sq. and the Wharf just for a change of scenery. The Argonaut will definitely be my place to stay on the weeks that I stay at the Wharf. I loved everything about the place. The staff was great. I had missed the wine hour by about 5 minutes when I checked in so they gave me a voucher for a glass of wine at the bar. The room was very clean and comfortable.Being right around the corner from Ghirardelli Square, I took advantage of a cool evening and went and got a cup of hot cocoa. The next morning I picked up breakfast at Starbucks and walked across the street to have a nice morning on the beach before I went into the office. The location is great.Love the Argonaut and looking forward to going back in a couple of weeks."
2,2006,"Eagerly Anticipating Our Next Stay at the Argonaut	We are already planning our next visit to this hotel. We stayed here for three days for our anniversary in the company of our little bichon and had such a wonderful experience. The staff was amazing, incredibly helpful, and always treated our little dog like she was a valued guest as well. She loved the attention of the doormen and the front desk each time she came through. The Argonaut truly made us feel at home. We purchased a three day pass for the cable car/trolley car/muni system at the cable car turnaround right next door to the hotel which made it so easy to get around San Francisco and Fisherman's Wharf.We are planning to give an Argonaut gift certificate to our son and daughter-in-law for Christmas this year. We can't think of any other hotel in San Francisco we'd rather share with them."
3,2006,"Nov 23 2009 	Stunning hotel with superb staff and comfortable rooms!	We finished off a tour of California here and loved this hotel! Superb staff from the doorment to the concierge, and the front desk to the restaurant. They couldn't do enough to help us.Loved the decor, even though anchors aren't usually my thing. Very children friendly without losing any of the adult friendliness. Really gorgeous, comfy, stylish and sociable lobby area to enjoy an hour or so by the fire.We wouldn't hestitate to come back here anytime."
4,2006,"Nov 19 2009 	EXCELLENT HOTEL NICELY SITUATED	The hotel is situated at the quieter part of the wharf. The staff were excellent, we used room service twice. Both times the service was prompt and the food was good. Our room was very nice we had twin beds which were a good size. The restaurant at the hotel is as good as any on the wharf. Jack's bar is next door if you are looking for something livelier. We found the wharf area very touristy so the hotel and the area immediately around it was a godsend. The hotel is located alongside the trolley turnaround although if you want to explore the city use the public transport it is a lot cheaper."
5,2006,"Nov 18 2009 	Great Location	This is just the best place to stay, the open top sight seeing bus stops a few blocks away, the tram terminus is in the next street and you can walk to where you get the ferry for Alcatraz. Walk out of the hotel and take a right and you're amongst all the shops and restaurants, some great places for breakfast such as Johnny Rockets and a place that makes bread in all kinds of animal shapes. Now about the hotel, rooms are spacious and nicely decorated: loved the nautical theme! There is a lovely warm feeling about the hotel and the reception area is a great place to relax in lovely big comfy sofas and armchairs."
6,2006,"Nov 17 2009 	Great Location at Fishermans Wharf	Close to Ghiradelli Square and cable car turnabout. Wonderful old brick building. The rooms were quiet and the beds and linen were very good. Parking is $40 but 25% discount if you have a hybrid. At the rental desk you get another discoun for Hybrids so a good deal there as well.  We booked an inside room but they upgraded us to an outside room and had a partial view of the Golden Gate bridge,"
7,2006,"Nov 12 2009 	Fantastic Hotel!	This was a fantastic hotel. The location is perfect. The rooms are lovely, we had three to a room and it was a very good size. Alcatraz &amp; the Golden Gate Bridge are just outside, a short stroll. The cable cars are just outside too. The wine tasting each evening was a great end to a day too! Highly recommended."
8,2006,"Nov 10 2009 	Don't stay anywhere else	Wonderful hotel. So friendly and homely. We had booked and paid for other hotels before leaving the UK, but wished we had stayed there the whole time. We moved to the 5* Fairmont after, but it was nowhere near as good as the Argonaut."
9,2006,"Nov 8 2009 	Great Stay	Just returned from spending 4 nights at teh Argonaut in San Francisco. The hotel is located on Fisherman's Wharf. The location is excellent. Ghardelli square and Pier 39 are just a short walk away. The service and condition of the hotel was superb. They have free wine in the lobby from 5 to 6 each night, which was nice. There is plenty to do within a short walk of this hotel. I hightly recommend it, great stay!.."
10,2006,"Nov 8 2009 	Superior in every respect	Kimpton properties never disappoint, and this gem on Fisherman's Wharf is no exception. Clever and sleek nautical decor, gracious and attentive service, your selection of outstanding restaurants at every price range nearby (including an In-n-Out Burger!), and no fewer than three good quality bike rental shops within a 9-iron of the front door (6 mi to the Golden Gate, 11 to the peak of the Marin Headlands). One of my most enjoyable hotel stays for business in many years."
11,2006,"Nov 6 2009 	Excellent location excellent service	We stayed 2 nights. The rooms were cozy. It felt like you were in a cruise ship because of the nautical themes. Complimentary wine tasting every 5pm (this past week they were show casing Francis Coppola cabs). It was pretty good. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is so close to a lot of cool spots such as the fishermans wharf, dining shopping, chinatown, and the muni cars.Also, they have complimentary WIFI, which is always good.I would recommend you purchase the Hotel Package with the Complimentary overnight parking. The parking can get very steep in SF. The overnight parking at Arganaut is about $40 per night. We got the complimentary parking package so we didn't need to pay for the overnight parking.The hotel only has 4 floors. We got a room on the fourth floor. The sheets were very clean, the bed was very comfortable. The bathrooms were very clean and the stone in the bathroom floor felt very clean. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Arganaut. We definitely would stay there again."
12,2006,"Nov 5 2009 	What a nice surprise	I went to check out this hotel for a business meeting, but would definitely return as a family. This newer property is on the north end of Fisherman's Wharf and has a completely different feel that the busier part of the Wharf. It juts up to a park where the cable cars turn around (but never heard one smidge of cable car noise) and if you are lucky enough to have the view I did (Golden Gate bridge in the distance on one side and Alcatrez on the other) you may never leave your room. I watched birds diving into the bay for fish and tons of exercisers heading out along the bay to run. It is a perfect jumping off location for experiencing the city, while feeling like you aren't smack in the center of a busy city.The hotel itself is also very nice. The nautical theme is just on this side of too much, but it seems to work. The rooms are large and clean, the bathrooms nice. The onsite restaurant has award winning chowders that were wonderful.Like I said...a very nice surprise. Definitely check it out. (And splurge on the Bay view.)"
13,2006,"Nov 3 2009 	Accomodating and Friendly Hotel with Hidden Perks	Love my stay at this hotel. It wasn't overly fancy and had a fun, casual feel to it. The staff was extremely accomodating and friendly. They remembered my name throughout the duration of my stay and were very helpful. The hotel also offered a free wine &quot;happy hour&quot; each night that was definitely a perk to staying there. Great location, easy to get around from hotel."
14,2006,"Nov 1 2009 	Great Hotel	We stayed at the Argonaut twice in September while travelling around California. Upon arrive we were told that there was an error with the booking and there was not a room. However, they had found us a room in the Sheraton about 4 blocks away, they paid for our nights accommodation plus refunded our money for the room and gave us $20 for taxis between the hotel plus a bottle of wine. Following our night in the Sheraton we returned and stayed in a room on 3rd floor with a view of over Hyde Pier and towards the Golden Gate Bridge. The staff was exceptional and willing to offer information about how to get about to various sightseeing attractions. The rooms were well proportioned and stocked with Aveda products.Food in the Blue Mermaid was excellent value for money. We will definitely be staying here again next time we are in San Francisco."
15,2006,"Nov 1 2009 	Nice locations cold shower	Good location: opposite to Maritime National Historical Park and next to the Cable Cars. Nice spacious room, good bed, large bathroom. BIG disadvantage: COLD shower. Not only in the morning at 'rushhour', but also late at night. So there seems to be a problem with the hot water supply.We didn't have breakfast at the restaurant, but there is plenty to choose from in walking distance. Valet parking is very expensive (43 dollar p/n). When you become a Kimpton member (for free via their internetsite) you can book a pakkage with parking. Then parking is only 1 dollar p/n."
16,2006,"Oct 30 2009 	Ideal hotel for families	The Argonaut is a great place to stay for families touring San Francisco because it is a clean and hospitable hotel in a child-friendly part of town. The hotel has a nice Maritime Museum inside, and the Cannery with restaurants and Norman's ice cream are literally right outside your window. The cable car turn around, Hyde Street Pier (my kids loved this!), Ghiradelli Square, Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf are all within a few blocks walk. Starbucks is at the back of the building, and Walgreen's and Trader Joe's are about a 4 to 5 block walk. We even walked to the Exploratorium ( this museum is a MUST DO for kids), which is a fairly level and beautiful several mile walk.  We chose the Argonaut because of its location, and for the fact that we wanted an upscale hotel without all the stuffiness. The hotel's decor is fun and playful. The rooms at the Argonaut are spacious and clean, plus the beds are uber comfy. Our room faced out into the Cannery courtyard, and at night we could listen to the featured outdoor live entertainment as we settled into bed. We considered this a plus, as we were so wiped out at the end of the day and our beds were so comfortable, not much would have kept us awake. The staff is friendly and helpful, although except for the doormen, not quite at the level found at most 4-star hotels. We paid a nightly rate of about 60% of the rack rate, and I think that was a good price for this hotel. The Argonaut gave me my money's worth and is definitely the best hotel on Fisherman's Wharf."
17,2006,"Oct 29 2009 	Free wine was the icing on the cake	We stayed at this hotel in August 2009. It is a relatively small hotel on the sea front at Fisherman's Wharf. We dropped our car off at the valet parking outside the hotel and were immediatley made very welcome. The rooms are spacious, very clean and comfortable. The hotel reception staff were very helpful. Between 5pm and 6pm each eveing there is a wine tasting in the lounge. In reality this is the opportunity to have a few glasses of very nice wine on the house and chat to other residents if you wish.We also received complimentary breakfasts each monring which was a bonus. The hotel is very well positioned for Fisherman's Wharf and very close to the Tram terminus.Overall my wife and I together with our two teenage children enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel."
18,2006,"Oct 29 2009	Pleasant experience	Recently returned from 3 days at the Argonaut Hotel with my adult son. Excellent experience. Rooms were very large, comfortable and nicely appointed. Location is excellent for seeing all San Francisco has to offer. Bike rental is around the corner if you would like to bike over the Golden Gate bridge. Nice wine reception each evening from 5-6 pm. Booked through 1800hotels and got a great rate. Have stayed in San Francisco 6 previous times but this is my favorite hotel of all I've stayed in. Blue Mermaid restaurant has a nice continental breakfast included with the room."
19,2006,"Oct 29 2009 	Great Hotel - Perfect Location	We absolutely loved staying the the Argonaut Hotel, it's right on fishermans wharf and walking distance to everywhere that side of town. The cable car is in the park right next door and all the tourist busses leave from the street the other side. The hotel staff were really friendly and allowed us to print our Alcatraz booking confirmation that we'd forgot to bring. The wifi in the rooms was free if you sign up to their newsletter which was very useful for my iPhone and checking the exchange rate!When we come back to San Fran we will definately be staying here again."
20,2006,Oct 26 2009 	I can't wait to come back!	I arrived for a stay at the Argonaut on 27 Sept. Greeted warmly by John at the door who managed to remember my name for the next week! Man must have a good memory! My room wasnt ready when I arrived but that was ok. It was only midday and Im now used to hotels not having rooms ready till 3. I left my bags with the bell desk and went for a long walk n some lunch.Argonaut is situated perfectly at the quiet end of the Wharf area. CAble car turnaround is across the road. Just a few mins walk however from Pier 39 with the sea lions and bay cruise boats.Need coffee?? Starbucks at the back of the bulding.Need shampoos etc? Walgreens around the block.Breakfast at the Blue Mermaid downstairs - 9 out of 10.Free glass of wine downstairs every night...10/10 ! I LOVED the rooms..ok u may think it a tad themed..but the bathrooms were METICULOUS! I love a clean bathroom. Plenty space in our room which overlooked the Cannery courtyard.Yes reception does get busy at times...and the concierge needs more than 1 staff attending at times but hey...I still loved it! I have a trip with my husband coming in April for our Silver Wedding and I'll definately stay at the Argonaut again!
21,2006,"Oct 25 2009 	Wonderful location for a first time visit.	This was our first visit to SF and the location of the Argonaut is excellent. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were spotless and clean. I would suggest a city tour to learn some interesting facts then get out and about on foot &amp; cable car. Opposite the hotel is a Maritime museum which is really nice to stroll around. A visit to Alcatrez is a must, not what I expected at all. Would definitely stay again just on the edge of all the hustle and bustle."
22,2006,"Oct 18 2009 	Fab stay- would definately recommend.	We stayed here for 3 nights before travelling down highway 1. Hotel Argonaut had been recommended to us by friends and we were definately not disappointed. Great room and location - just around the corner from the cable car stop, good restaurants nearby. Would stay here again!"
23,2006,Oct 18 2009 	WOW	I love love love this hotel!When we arrived we were upgraded to a bay bridge view room! We also had a lovely bottle of red in the room upon arrivals (Were there to celebrate boyfriends birthday) The room was huge! Absolutly immaculate! Bed comfy! Bathroom again huge! It did take us a while to walk to the room from reception! This hotel is large!The only negative would be most of the things (food wise) in the mini bar were out of date! Lovely bar called Jack Murphys about 3 doors along and the best burgers in SF from In Out Burger about a 5 min walk away!Overall loved the hotel though and would deffo stay here again!
24,2006,Oct 16 2009 	Covers all bases in a great location	Having stayed in SF a few times this area is the best place to stay. Yes it has tacky bits but the centre get's a bit oppressive. Fisherman's wharf is a much more pleasent living env. The hotel covers all the bases. It's a bit tacky in some ways too but expensice tacky and you don't feel nickel and dimed. I'd stay there again but I wouldn't rave about it.
25,2006,Oct 14 2009 	San Fransico was awesome	This hotel is as good and as authentic as you can get as far as the fisherman's wharf. It is not a luxury hotel by any means but has lots of character.
26,2006,"Oct 14 2009 	The best hotel I have stayed at in a long time.....	My partner and I stayed at the argonaut at the start of our 3 week trip along the west coast of america. I have to say it was the best hotel we stayed at on the trip, we stayed at some great places over the 3 weeks. The location is fantastic and we walked to most places or got the tram which was literally a 2 minute stroll along the pier. We also walked to the golden gate bridge from the hotel which was amazing.The hotel has a nautical theme, not taccy in the slightest, tastefully done and true to its surroundings. The room we had was a standard one I think, 2 queens sized beds. Very big, great bathroom, facilities etc. funky dressing gowns! A great touch was the complimentry wine tasting, needless to say we forgot about our jet lag that night! We didn't eat at the hotel but there were the facitlites there if you needed to. Plenty of other restaurants to visit. You must try the restaurant at the top of macy's looking out on to the square for lunch, amazing and so resonable! Booked our Alcatraz tickets with the concierge without a problem, in general vey helpful. All in all a wonderful 3 night stay and was everything we thought it was going to be and more."
27,2006,"Oct 10 2009 	Unique hotel	Summer vacation for us. We stayed 4 nights at the Argonaut. The building is a renovated Del Monte canning plant I believe. Nicely decorated in a nautical theme. Everything is neat and clean. Staff mostly attentive but this was a VERY busy time of year it seems. Although the staff tried to be helpful it felt like there were just too many demands being placed on them and some were overlooked. Small things. Location is great, right at Fisherman's wharf, you can see Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz from the hotel. Also the famous Buena Vista is a few steps away for your late night Irish Coffee or breakfast . Despite being so close to all this activity, our room (which faced the street) was remarkably quiet."
28,2006,"Oct 9 2009 	Nice hotel very close to the wharf and other activities	We tried out a tall room which Kimpton offers in many of their properties. The accommodations were good for tall people except the robes weren't nearly long enough for my 6'10&quot; boyfriend. The room was pretty large and had some extra amenities such as a DVD player and an iHome alarm clock in addition to the usual hotel things. The 5 pm wine hour was a nice touch. We enjoyed the restaurant too, especially the clam and corn chowder."
29,2006,"Oct 8 2009 	Excellent Hotel	Very nice hotel. Rooms are very clean and beds are super comfortable. You do get some road noise from the street, but not too much. The wine cocktail hour is very nice, especially sitting by the fireplace. Wonderful concierge and the restaurant was good."
30,2006,"Oct 8 2009 	We loved this hotel in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf.	We spent 5 days in San Franscisco for Spring Break. This hotel is located right across from the cable car stop and were able to ride downtime very easily. Plus, we were able to see all of the attractions at Fisherman's Wharf. I think it's the best hotel on the Wharf. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean with plenty of hot water. The only complaint would be that the queen sized beds were not the typical queen size but a little smaller. With 3 out of 4 of us being 6 feet or over, it was a little tight. If you go to the Wharf, you have to try the corn/crab crowder in the Argonaut resturant; it's incredible."
31,2006,"Oct 8 2009 	Perferct family hotel!	My two girls (10 and 7) and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Argonaut Hotel in San Fran. It was perfectly located for all the family attraction with a spiffy design that the kids enjoyed. We appreciated the free wine and sparkling juice hour with Wii games on hand after long days of exploring the city. And the hotel restaurant, The Blue Mermaid, was tasty and easy to enjoy as a family when we wanted to stay close to our home-away-from-home while a destination for others! Two thumbs way up  I can't wait to stay here again!"
32,2006,"Oct 8 2009 	San Francisco...the perfect ending to a 2800 mile tour of CA and OR. The perfect location the Argonaut!	Online presentations fall short of the full glory of this wonderfully restored and converted warehouse...now a luxury hotel in the heart of the San Francisco Wharf District. Wake up and find yourself in the middle of everything and wanting for nothing. The staff is always present and never noticed until you have a need. One could not ask for more in attention and care. The &quot;happy hour&quot; provides travelers a full hour to visit with others in San Francisco from all over the world. What a joyous exchange of chatter with so many people seeking to learn more about each other.Thanks, Argonaut, for the perfect ending to a 2-week road trip through some of the most incredible sites in America. We will be back."
33,2006,"Oct 8 2009 	Cute Nautical Theme Hotel	Right on Ghiradelli Square in the Cannery Building - a great location for first time visitors to San Francisco. Walking distance to North Beach, Chinatown, Nob Hill. Kimpton Hotels offer great style, and fun perks like free wine at happy hour in the lobby. Hotel restaurant the Blue Mermaid was also thematic with good food and super friendly staff."
34,2006,"Oct 8 2009 	Beautiful Hotel Great location.............	This is a beautiful Hotel. We were very, very comfortable. The rooms were beautiful and clean and quiet.The most disappointing part was the price of parking. $43 per night!!!!!! It is a lot of money when you stay 4 nights and don't use your car. There wasn't any other &quot;safe&quot; options so we had no choice really.Having said that, everyone was fantastic and friendly, except for a female concierge. We needed assistance to book a Baseball game or at least find out about it, and she was more intent on speaking to someone who was trying to sell her something, so we walked off after waiting for about 10 minutes. We returned to the front desk a bit later and the lady there couldn't have been more helpful. She was fantastic.I recommend the wine tasting and the breakfast. Location was fantastic, base of cable cars and close to piers and restaurants......"
35,2006,"Oct 4 2009 	Very nice stay here	We just spent 3 days in SF and at the Argonaut. The front desk was very helpful and let us check in 6 hours early when we arrived and even upgraded our room.The nautical, yet modern theme of the hotel is very nice and the room was clean and roomy. The noise from the streets was a bit noisy at times but the sound of the famous cable cars was kind of fun to hear from our room. For some reason neither one of us could comfortable in our beds though. Not sure if it was us or the mattresses though.The staff at the restaurant was nothing short of amazing! Friendly, smiling and always willing to strike up a conversation. The location of hotel is a bit touristy but close to almost every great neighborhood, either by foot, bus or cable car. Thanks Argonaut!"
36,2006,"Oct 1 2009 	Overpriced and Poor Front Desk Service	We splurged for this hotel because of great reviews and the location. While the location is great, many things were lacking. While attempting to check in we waited in line for quite some time. After checking in, I waited in line again to verify that our room was a King rather than Queen. Was assured it was a King. It was not. Our package included some family options and a gift but I had to hassle several times to get these promised items. I would choose another hotel and save my money for other fun on our next visit.Pros: The restaurant was good and we enjoyed happy hour and the breakfast. The bell staff were friendly and helpful."
37,2006,"Sep 28 2009 	Great Hotel in a Great Location	The Argonaut is a great hotel in a perfect location. It's right on Fisherman's Wharf and only steps away from shopping, restaurants and attractions.The hotel itself is very clean and comfortable. I wouldn't recommend taking a car there if you can avoid it. If I remember correctly, parking is $40.00 per night.The hotel staff are very professional and really try to make you feel like a guest.They do have a computer in the lobby you can use to check email, etc."
38,2006,"Sep 28 2009 	Modern Stylish	Great atmosphere, good service and style. Ideally placed for all the tourist areas of San Francisco."
39,2006,"Sep 27 2009 	Great location for sightseeing	Just far enough to be away from the noise, but within walking distance to Fishermen's Wharf and the Hyde Park Trolley. Other transportation, including cable cars, is nearby. If you are looking for a charming SF neighborhood to settle into, this area is not the spot, but if you are looking for a base for a few nights from which to see the sights it works well.The &quot;bay view&quot; room on the 3rd floor was really a view of the rooftop of the restaurant across the street, but you can see Alcatraz over the top. Although rooms on the other side of the hotel would have the advertised view (out a very small window) of the Golden Gate Bridge, I don't believe the cost is justified; especially if you have to sacrifice a King bed. The front desk reduced the rate slightly when I complained, which was a nice gesture.Rooms were comfortable, the nautical theme is cute. No noise in the hallways. I did not rate the service because we were mostly out of the hotel."
40,2006,"Sep 26 2009 	this hotel is fab	The location of this hotel is great, within walking distance of Fishermans wharf , bars and resturants and cable cars. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms lovely, clean and had all the amenities that you need.Would definately stay here again."
41,2006,"Sep 24 2009 	Loved it!	This was our second stay in this hotel, as we first visited in 2007. I mentioned this and was upgraded to a room with a view, at no extra charge, a great start to the holiday! We love the location, as it is on the edge of the Fisherman's Wharf area, but not too crazy. There are plenty of places to eat nearby and a short walk from lots of major attractions.We received complimentary continental breakfast vouchers and loved the Blue Mermaid restaurant. The breakfast included pastries, toast or muffins, tea, coffee or juice and a fresh fruit salad. I usually paid $5 or $6 dollars extra, to add a cooked breakfast, which was delicious. The atmosphere, setting and service were all of a high standard.The hotel also has a complimentary drinks hour, offering wine and sparkling apple juice, as well as snacks. This was very popular, so seating was limited, but this didn't matter, as it was a lovely way to spend an hour, meeting other people, or just chilling after a busy day.We booked the hotel with Virgin holidays, so am unsure of the exact price, as it was one of 5 hotels we stayed in during our visit, however, the holiday rep told us it was cheaper than the Holiday Inn express, so maybe Virgin have a good deal with the hotel?Our room was on the top floor and was very clean and spacious. The nautical decor is very nice and the bedding of a very high quality. We experienced no problems with noise (as mentioned in some reviews)All the staff were very friendly and helpful.Would I stay here again? Absolutely!"
42,2006,"Sep 22 2009 	Great location and high quality hotel	The Argonaut is in a great spot - just a couple of minutes away from all of the Fisherman's wharf attractions. The hotel is of a high standard - good service, decent sized rooms (we had a standard), nice amenities etc. San Fran is not a cheap town and the Argonaut is priced accordingly, but I think it's reasonable."
43,2006,"Sep 19 2009 	Noisy	Great location........ expensive for parking, don't rent one.Food service at breakfast fair/slow. Noisy, noisy, noisy.Can hear doors closing, road and band noise at night."
44,2006,"Sep 18 2009 	Love it!	My husband &amp; I enjoy Kimpton hotels. They are so funky! We stayed at The Argonaut for 2 nights. Upon arrival, since we had missed wine hour, the bellman gave us coupons for a free chowder and 2 free wines at the adjoining restaurant, The Blue Mermaid. Nice touch since we got in late and we were hungry and needed to unwind. Food was good, service was attentive at dinner. The location can't be beat. It is on the &quot;quieter&quot; side of the Wharf. The hotel is within walking distance to Ghirardelli Square and if you are a little more adventurous, you can walk to North Beach. If not, hop a cable car. Plenty around as far as restaurants--Starbucks around the corner, Joanie's diner (good breakfast) across the street, the Buena Vista Cafe is around the corner (good Irish coffee). Love the decor--you feel like you are on a ship. Rooms are nicely appointed. Aveda products are provided. The bed was comfy and there was plenty of electrical outlets. We ate one breakfast at The Blue Mermaid. Service the second time around was so so. Our waitress seemed to forget about us. Don't know if it was because it was busier than dinner. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and we would stay here again if we are in SF."
45,2006,"Sep 16 2009 	You wont be disappointed !	If you want a reasonable priced hotel that is clean, convenient with good service this is it. I think that the almost 700 reviews with a 4.7 rating speak volumes about this hotel. Some people will always find something to whine about. Sure the odd person has some bad luck or some unforeseen occurrence, but this was not the case with us. I researched plenty before we booked at this hotel and could have spent a lot more money to stay at other hotels that didn't come close to the reviews that this hotel had. We had a great time and not on complaint. Sure, the restaurant beside is not ultimate dining experience, but there are plenty of other restaurants around. I am booking a trip for November with 3 friends for a football trip and will be returning, No question."
46,2006,"Sep 15 2009 	Excellent hotel bang in Fisherman's Wharf	Stayed here on a trip to California, were in San Francisco for 4 nights.ServiceVery friendly and polite check in staff, always helpful and smiley. The hotel restaurant also had a good and welcoming service. The rooms were spotless and cleaned to a high standard.RoomThe room was a good size, had a room with 2 double beds and was well equipped with free wi-fi, tv and iPod radio dock. The bathroom was clean and modern also. As the hotel was originally a warehouse, the window was small and had a limited view when we expected to have great views over at Alcatraz and the bay.LocationOne of the few decent hotels in Fisherman's Wharf. A fantastic location for exploring the wharf, biking the bridge and Alcatraz. However it's very touristy and the food isn't great in the area. Best bit is to jump on the cable car a minutes walk from the hotel and go into downtown San Francisco. It gets busy at night, but a taxi isn't too expensive either. AmenitiesDidn't really use much of the hotel's features as were out and about most of the time, it did have a Nintendo Wii free of use in the hotel lobby though which was a nice touch.OverallA comfortable, high standard hotel defiantly worth considering if planning to visit San Francisco."
47,2006,"Sep 12 2009 	The nautical theme and position will appeal to a particular traveller however it didn't to me.	This hotel came highly recommended by a friend who was participating in a sailing competition with my husband. We were downtown in the JW Marriott and thought it a good idea to be somewhere closer to the Yacht Club. We checked in on 24 August and were shown to our room which was described as 2 Queen suite. The first thing we saw was the toilet which was 2 steps to the right from the door opening, the beds were more like lge singles, the room was pokey, the bright yellow/vivid blue decor a visual affront, a strong odour similar to the Sea Lions at the wharf. I asked to be moved to another room hoping that the smell and size would be improved, it was identical to the previous one with the same rancid odour. This one had a ground floor window outlook - and we were witness to a pedestrian leaning on our window then promptly vomiting. What can I say, the noise, the run down tacky souvenir stores, the odour, pokey rooms, loud decor did not appeal to me. I discreetly approached front desk for a third time and let them know I would not be staying as the rooms were not to my liking. I expressed concern that they had my credit card details and would place a charge on it. I was assured that that would not happen. When we arrived back in Australia and checked our credit card statement they had placed a $258.00 charge on our card for a 'no show' ( meaning we booked then didn't turn up). It has taken 3 International calls, 1 email and speaking to 2 Managers to rectify this problem. I had to prove I had personally been there by naming the 2 front desk staff that I dealt with ( I couldn't ) but luckily I remembered the Bell hop name and a conversation I'd had with him so they had to verify with him!!Needless to say I got on the phone and rebooked us into the JW Marroiott and ran out of there! If you like a nautical theme, won't spend much time in yr room, don't mind the noise of busy street and endless pedestrians, eat seafood, and have a blocked nose then go ahead and book. Also it was twice the price per night as the JW Marriott ( see my review of the Marriott )"
48,2006,"Sep 9 2009 	Nice hotel shame about the food	As others have said... perfectly situated, excellent staff, and fantastic view if you happen to get a Bay View or Gate View room. We'd booked Kimpton's &quot;Breakfast for $1 more&quot; offer, which meant the Blue Mermaid restaurant next door. We tried dinner the first night, and found that the service was inattentive, slow, and (more than once) incorrect. One of the fish dishes was served so undercooked it was practically raw, which is just dangerous - and this was &quot;fish and chips&quot;, not sushi. The cooked breakfasts were cold by the time our waiter brought them over, and more than once only bore a passing resemblance to our order."
49,2006,"Sep 5 2009 	Best hotel in san Francisco!	We stayed at the Argonaut in June 2009 for ten nights. The first week we had a Twin Queen room with a Bay view - it was perfect! We had an amazing view of Alcatraz and although the street can be noisy, it didn't disturb us at all. The room was very comfortable, clean and spacious. The bathroom, although small, was adequate and they even have a list of toiletries you can buy if you've forgotten anything! We were also provided with animal print robes which you can also buy at the end of your stay! The mini bar is well stocked and there are tea/coffee making facilites.For our second week, we stayed in a Deluxe King. The view from this room was nothing special but as it was at the back of the hotel, it was very quiet. Again, the room was perfect and exceptionally clean.The staff at the Argonaut were wonderful! Everyone we met was very friendly and helpful. John the doorman was particularly nice and gave us plenty of tips on places to go and how to get around. Reception staff were helpful and all the bellboys friendly and fun!We ate at the Blue Mermaid once and also ordered room service once. The room service was reasonably priced, delicious and quick to arrive.We attended the wine hour every evening. If you wanted a seat, you had to get there a good half hour before so most evenings we would take our drinks to our room. One night, my partner got id'd during wine hour even though he is 31 - he was not impressed seeing as this happened quite a while into our stay.We loved the nautical theme which was present throughout the hotel. The location of the hotel is perfect! The cablecar turnaround is yards away and plenty other attractions. The hotel is surrounded by good restaurants and some funky bars! Over the road is Ghiradelli Aqua Park which is great if you want to do a bit of swimming or have a quiet moment on the beach.All in all, we had the most amazing time at the Argonat and can't wait to go back!"
50,2006,"Sep 5 2009 	Fabulous Stay - Enjoyed Every Minute!	My partner and I stayed at the Argonaut for 4 nights (17th-21st August 2009), on the first leg of a West Coast of the USA tour. We selected this hotel for its purported, excellent location on Fisherman's Wharf. We had booked a deluxe, view room on a room only basis. On arrival at the hotel, we were impressed by the warm welcome and efficient check-in and even more impressed by our room size and its amenities. We found that we had a view of the Golden Gate, but i have to say that much of the time this view was obscured by the San Francisco fog. The nautical decor of our room was very striking, but I, personally, loved it and felt it to be in perfect keeping with the hotel's geographical location. We were delighted to find that the hotel was providing us with complimentary continental breakfast and that there was a free wine reception between 5 and 6 pm every day - this proved to be a very congenial event that we appreciated very much after each day of sightseeing in this fabulous city. They also provided free, unlimited internet access.Throughout our stay, we found the staff to be very helpful and friendly and we enjoyed breakfast and several evening meals in the hotel's restaurant. The menu consisted of mainly fish and seafood (as could be expected) and we found the food to be of good quality and reasonably priced. The hotel's location is perfect for visiting San Francisco as it is adjacent to the cable car turnaround on Fisherman's Wharf and also very convenient for hopping onto the great 'streetcars'. Pier 39 is a short and pleasant stroll away.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to explore this beautiful city and I can't wait to book another stay there so that I can explore the area at my leisure."
51,2006,"Sep 2 2009 	Fantastic stay at the Hotel Argonaut!	After weighing up boutique hotels downtown with high parking costs vs staying at the Argonaut. w decided on it for three nights-booked by phone and did the parking, breakfast, cable car ticket package. It was a bit of a splurge for us, but worth every penny! This place was so charming and enjoyable. From the minute we met Steve, the valet, we knew it was going to be a good experience! All the staff seemed really well chosen and went out of their way to help, but Steve really made it special! Our room was lovely! We loved the nautical theme and attention to detail - alot of thought has gone into the restoration of this old cannery building and the decorating. So clean and well maintained! Starbucks coffee and Aveda toiletries and a well stocked mini bar (right down to telescopes for the kids!) with prices we thought weren't too bad at all. We were lucky to have a window with a view to the lovely colors and liveliness of the courtyard and even had a bit of a city view with the Transamerica building right there. Yes, there was music playing throughout the day, but if you shut your windows you heard nothing. We did have a noisy baby crying for awhile the first night and it was pretty loud, but it stopped, which was the important thing! Not too keen on the large dogs trotting about with their owners, we must say, and I do suffer from allergies, but we had asked for a non pet room and I was fine.  The breakfast was excellent....one entree, juice coffee came with our package. We also dined in the restaurant and had a few drinks one evening....all good. I must say though that if they opened the room up without that double row of tables in the middle it would be better. If you end up on the non-bar side, it lacks ambience. Super location. Helpful staff - they had stamps to sell and mailed the postcards for me. A tip from the concierge to get over the the City Wide Tours around the corner for around ten-ish enabled us to score some Alcatraz tickets (with the purchase of their tours of course) - which was great, as they were sold out for the next few days.It was for a late run out to the island which limited your time there, but it worked. The tours with these open double decker buses were great. We did the City tour, the park tour and the run to Sausalito and then we took the ferry back. The wine hour they lay on daily was very generous and we had fun getting to know other guests. Yes, there were lots of families and kids and we were a couple, but there were others like us too and everyone was very happy to be there, you could tell.We would highly recomment the Hotel Argonaut!"
52,2006,"Sep 2 2009	We picked the right hotel.	just returned from 4 night stay at Argonaut Hotel in San Francisco. Loved the hotel. Quiet location but steps from cable car turn around so very convenient. Had a 3 day muni pass and went all over the city with buses, cable cars and street cars.Hotel staff very friendly and very helpful. Loved the wine reception in the evening. they went out of their way to make us feel welcome.A gem."
53,2006,"Aug 31 2009 	Good stay!	We (my partner &amp; daughter 18 yrs) stayed three nights in one room. We had a nice, large room, clean and comfortable. Valet parking was well organised and other services swift and kind (bell-boy, concierge). We visited once the complimentary wine party, wich was nice meeting other people. Price - quality excellent."
54,2006,"Aug 31 2009 	loud wedding parties!!	the hotel was overall good, except they had very loud wedding parties that echo though the rooms and can't stop the noise. Never in many years of travel have I had to deal with such a problem. Because of that I say be careful."
55,2006,"Aug 26 2009 	a view would be nice!	Only stayed here two nights. Wish it could have been longer as we love San Francisco. Have stayed at both the Holiday Inns in the past, but decided to treat ourselves to the Argonaut after all its great reviews.After a bit of a mix up when the receptionist thought we'd only reserved one room instead of two, we were pleasantly surprised to find we were entitled to breakfast on the two mornings.It was only juice, tea or coffee, a bowl of fruit and a choice of pastry or toast but it was all right for nothing. The complementary wine in the evening was a nice touch even though we didn't like the wine. The rooms were very smart and actually looked like the photos on the hotel web site. Internet was free in the room , something other hotels should consider in this day and age.My only gripe was that our view was over a courtyard to rooms with shutters at the windows which ,sort of, made me think of Alcatraz!I think you have to pay extra for any decent view.The cost of the valet carparking is rather extortionate, but so was that at both Holiday Inns. Can certainly recommend this hotel for its good points and excellent locality and would definitely go back, but would try to get a better room ( with a view )next time."
56,2006,"Aug 25 2009 	Wonderful!!!	We had the package that included parking, breakfast, and a cable car pass. It was well worth the small upcharge as the breakfast was wonderful, the parking would have been expensive, and the cable car pass was for 3 days. The hotel is in a great location and everyone was helpful and nice. Can't wait to get back!!!"
57,2006,"Aug 21 2009 	Pet and Kid Friendly - and great for grownups too!	We just returned from a long weekend in San Francisco, staying at the Argonaut. The location is perfect. It is a couple blocks away from the huge loud crowds around Pier 39, yet just a short block to the cable car turnaround and Irish coffee at the Buena Vista. Although we were petless this weekend, we met many nice dogs during our stay, including several large dogs (like ours). The hotel is across the street from a dog-friendly park with a beach - terrific for dogs as well as kids. The maritime museum, with many boats to board, is also across the street. Ghirardelli Square is also two blocks away ( though sadly there aren't many fun places there anymore).The hotel itself is spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Our room faced an interior courtyard so there were no views - but no noise either, which we appreciated. The room was equipped with a coffeemaker (with complimentary Starbucks coffee!) iron &amp; ironing board, power strip with lots of outlets for laptops and phone chargers (why don't all hotels think of this?) and complimentary wi-fi. Very people-friendly!I've spent a lot more on hotels and received a lot less. The only downside is that parking is VERY expensive - but there is excellent nearby public transportation, so don't bring a car. And the staff is very friendly too. I'm sure we'll be back - I just can't think of a better place to stay in San Francisco..."
58,2006,"Aug 17 2009 	Perfect hotel for families	Enjoyed our recent stay at the Argonaut Hotel - rooms were spacious and very clean. This hotel is in the Cannery, a building that used to be the Del Monte Peach Canning Factory. Desk staff and front door staff were very friendly to my sons. Kids were offered free popsicles in the afternoon, and adults were offered wine during a complimentary happy hour while the kids played on the Wii in the lobby. We loved the leopard and zebra bathrobes! The location is perfect - right near Fisherman's Wharf.Room for improvement - the concierge staff seemed a bit overwhelmed with our simple requests for local tour info. The hotel restaurant (Blue Mermaid) had very slow service and was overpriced."
59,2006,"Aug 11 2009 	Awesome Hotel- Clean+Comfortable!	We stayed at the Argonaut Hotel from July 10th-17th, 2009. There were four of us. Overall it was an excellent hotel, and I have very little negative things to say about it.Rooms: The rooms were great! Very comfortable beds, and a nicely sized. For a family of four, it was a perfect room. Five people would have been a bit snug. The bathrooms were very clean, which is important to us. The room had a minibar with snacks ( which were quite expensive....$4 for a bottle of water). The nautical themed room was very nicely designed. There was even an ipod dock for me to charge and listen to my ipod! Location: The location is great, right on the wharf with LOTS of resturaunts and places to shop. The Blue Mermaid that is inside the hotel is AWESOME! I suggest their crab and corn choweder, and their Cioppiono ( I probably spelled that wrong ..but its kind of like a seafood stew with tomatoe sauce and wine). Across the street from the Argonaut, there is a resturaunt called Cioppiono's ...and my mom ordered cioppiono there and it was aweful!! Get it at the blue mermaid!! My other favourite resturaunts while I was there were : The San Franciscian and Joes Crab Shack ( if you dont like being in a loud setting..I wouldn't reccomend this ). The location is also right near bus stops and streetcar stops which can take you anywhere. Oh yeah- this hotel is also right beside a Ben + Jerrys ( for ice cream lovers :) )Tip for shopping: They have many stores that sell tshirts 3/10$ or 5/10$...the further away you walk from the hotel...the better deals you get. Service: Everyone was very helpful and nice! They would try everything for you to have a pleasant stay. The maids were very nice and always made sure you had everything you needed.** Every day at five pm the managers would give out/sample free wine for those staying at the hotel, and non alcoholic punches for kids. The negative: Walls were thin, and you could occasionally hear people in the next room having a conversation. Also, it was very loud as it is right on a busy tourist street...every day we heard a tour guide on a bus say &quot;..Rice-A-Roni...the San Francisco Treat!!&quot;..as well as the loud buses and cars. The way we fixed this problem was that we brought a noisemaker ( one of those small noisemakers you can buy for $20 at the pharmacy that make sounds of waves, thunderstorms, white noise, etc ..) and that helped ALOT to block out the noise when we slept.** Note: My mother is quite picky when it comes to staying at hotels. She always has some complaint about them but she LOVED this one! I didn't hear any complaints from her. The noise is really our only complaint- but as I said...we blocked it out at night with our noise machine."
60,2006,"Aug 11 2009 	Friendly atmosphere clean room great view. We loved it.	We didn't know quite what to expect with the Argonauts 'Nautical theme'. It could have been really kitsch. But it was very tastefully done.We pulled up after a long flight from the UK and the uniformed doorman in a white Pith Helmet opened the door for us, high fived the kids and gave us a friendly welcome.The checkin staff were helpful and friendly explaining everything to us and informing us of the free 6pm wine tasting in reception. Gets the evening off to a good start :-)In reception there is a small 'treasure chest' that the kids get to pick something from each day.The room was spotlessly clean and had a great view over the fishing harbour to Alcatraz and the Golden Gate bridge.Valet parking wasn't too badly priced. We certainly experienced more expensive parking on our holiday. And it's a 'per 24hr' charge so you can come and go as much as you wish at no extra charge.The cable car turnaround is right next door and the 'Big Red Shiny Mac Fireengine' of Fire Engine Tours leaves from right behind the hotel.If you are looking for a family friendly city centre hotel in a good location. I heartily recommend this hotel. I'll certaintly be staying here next time i'm in SF."
61,2006,"Aug 11 2009 	Great hotel and location... if you are lucky with your room	We just stayed at this very friendly and comfortable hotel in SF with my family. This hotel is clean and very well decorated. Our only (big) problem was that our room, on the second floor, was street level at the back of the hotel. Every morning we enjoyed the dustbin cleaners and their truck at 5.30 + street noise. We can definitely recommend this hotel, but just make sure you get a room at a higher level and not at the back of the building. Otherwise the staff is great and very kid's friendly."
62,2006,"Aug 10 2009 	One of my favorites	Things were a little disorganized at check-in but once they got everything figured out it was a wonderful stay. The beds and shower were nice. The room was a decent size for San Francisco and everything was clean and well kept. I really like the design of the lobby, definitely not your standard hotel. The wine reception was nice. It was busy but well managed. We had a bay view room and it was kind of a splurge but worth it. We were able to get a package with breakfast and Muni passes and valet parking on the hotel website. The location is also quite nice, right between Ghirardelli Square and Pier 39, both of which are worth a visit."
63,2006,"Aug 8 2009 	Excellent hotel clean comfortable. Definately recommend!	A fabulous place to stay in San Francisco. Upon arrival the bell boys relieve you of your baggage and take it to your room for you. ALL staff were incredibly friendly and useful and were willing to answer any questions. The conceierge staff are particularly helpful. The room was spotless - very clean and fresh. The beds were comfortable, there was a large tv, dvd player, bathroom products, area information and at an extra charge there is food and drink available. I have stayed in many hotels and I have to say that this is one of the best. The decor is nice and the whole hotel is kept very clean. The free wine hour between 5 and 6 is great! We also got free breakfast in the Mermaid restaurant which was good. We were upgraded free of charge to a room with a view of the golden gate bridge. The location is perfect - right on fishermans wharf. Only a 10 min walk to pier 39 with restaurants and shops and 15 mins to pier 33 where you get the boat to alcatraz (which was also good - book in advance though). There is an F line street car (tram) which goes right along the waterfront and down to union square where there are lots of shops. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone."
64,2006,"Aug 8 2009 	great experience	what a great hotel, excellent location at the wharf and 1 block from ghiradelli sq, right at the cable cars. Despite the busy location, our room was very quiet and had ample room for 2 adults and 2 teens. The staff could not have been any nicer or more helpful, great decor and very clean, we enjoyed the evening wine reception. Highly recommended"
65,2006,"Aug 7 2009 	A wonderful place	My son and I stayed there on a recent trip to SF. I was a little bit reluctant to stay in a noisy and touristic place as the Fisherman's Wharf but it turned out that the hotel, once you enter is a calm and quiet place. All the employees were very friendly and extra helpful with all our small requests. The room was beautiful, large, beautiful light and all those little details that make you feel comfortable beyond your regular needs.We had diner at the Blue Mermaid restaurant once and it turned out to be one of the best dinners we had there. The food was delicious, not expensive and the service again was great. The valet parking is expensive but absolutely worth it. If you're traveling with teenagers this is a great place to stay."
66,2006,Aug 7 2009 	Enjoyed Everything!	Spent the first two nights of our California anniversary trip at the Argonaut and what a great kickoff we had! The hotel is in a very convenient location within walking distance of many sights. The afternoon wine social in the lobby was an added bonus. Would highly recommend the hotel.
