51,1064,"Jun 21 2009 	Good value comfortable hotel	We had an excellent, one night stay in this hotel. For us, it could not have been better placed next to Kings Cross station. Our room was a good size and adequately furnished and the staff were helpful and efficient. We paid the extra for the full English breakfast and this was both good quality and good value for money  kept us going through the Chelsea Flower Show until 3 in the afternoon. We would definitely stay at this hotel again on our next trip to London."
52,1064,"Jun 17 2009 	Very Good Premier Inn	Stayed in this hotel overnight before going on the Eurostar. In general the hotel is fine with a good dining room and evening menues which means that you don't really have to go out for a meal . This room doubles as the breakfast room in the morning.The bar is also very good with excellent service from the staff there. The automated checkin is a bit mind blowing but manageable when you calm down, bit like the self service check outs at Tesco.Althought the bedrooms are small , the bathrooms ok ,allla re functional just try to make sure that you don't get a room overlooking the foyer as these are dark and pokey and in warm weather very hot. Cheap a\c in the rooms which are very noisy. clean"
53,1064,"Jun 16 2009 	A Must Stay	I stayed here with my fiance who had lived in London for 9 years, this being my 2nd trip to London.The hotel itself is lovely, staff very welcoming and helpful, even when check in at 2pm gets a bit hectic of a weekend! They make sure everyone is seen to quickly and efficiently. We had one problem though, as we were paying by credit card, we were asked to use the check in pods, which was fine....but the pods checked us into a twin and not a double. A quick call and a receptionist popped up with a new key to a new room. Sorted.The room was clean and bed very comfortable. Great strong shower in the bathroom although the aircon left a wee bit to be desired! It was a very warm weekend and the room did get a bit stuffy.Not the hotel's fault at all, but why parents insist it is ok for their children to run up and down hotel corridors screaming at 2am is beyond me.Check out also painless, they looked after our bags until it was time for us to go to the airport. Handed in keys, job done. Literally a minute walk away from Kings Cross / St Pancras station.Costa Coffee attached to the hotel as well as a bar area (which we never used) so it was a winner for us and we're going back in August with our friends and will not hesitate in using this hotel each time we visit!"
54,1064,"Jun 13 2009 	Above Average Premier Inn	We stayed here for 1 night in June 09 with our two year old. As other reviews state, it is convenient for St Pancras and Kings Cross; and Euston station is 5-10 mins walk away; plenty of buses around too. As usual for the Premier Inn chain, the hotel does what it says on the tin: it's basic, clean, with friendly staff. At check-in they were trialling a new automatic DIY check-in machine, a member of staff showed us how to use it and it was very fast and straightforward. You put your credit card in that you booked with, it takes your payment, and then gives you your room keys. Simple!This hotel has been renovated recently. Our room was on the small side compared to other Premier Inns weve stayed at, but the storage was good, and it was clean and fresh looking; additionally, there was a flat screen TV, and a small but smart looking bathroom, with a powerful shower.The building itself is modern, and therefore the rooms seemed to have good soundproofing, we had no problems with noise; we were at the end of a corridor so this may have helped.As seems to be usual with Premier Inns these days, breakfast was fully self-service. The only problem I have with this is when its busy, there are a lot of people to-ing and fro-ing between the tables with plates/cups of hot food/liquid  health and safety? However, 7.95 for as much as you can eat, and under 16s eat free is very good value. Wide range of breakfast foodstuffs, except no cheese or cooked meat. Hot breakfast has REAL mushrooms, not the disgusting tinned grey sludge that can be found in even more upmarket hotels. Whilst we were there the toasters didnt work properly, one undercooked and the other cremated! Still, I expect this was rectified as Premier Inn have a rolling programme of maintenance.120.00 for room only, is reasonable value for London, and if you need the nearby train stations, its the best option."
55,1064,"Jun 11 2009 	Convenient location great price great service. What more could you ask for?	This is a great hotel! Location: The location is a very short distance from King's Cross and St. Pancras - not the greatest night life, but you're minutes from anywhere and everywhere you'd want to be (Victoria, Circle, District, Piccadilly, etc. run right through this station). I heard from a few locals that St. Pancras area was previously a bit of a dodgy place known for prostitutes, but it's recently been cleaned up a lot with the introduction of St. Pancras International. I had NO problems whatsoever, there were always a lot of people around so it was very safe feeling, and I saw a good number of police officers in and around the station so I would say the city has been very successful in making this a safe neighborhood now.Service:Everyone from the front receptionists to the cleaners to the night staff was friendly, willing to help with just about anything, and knowledgeable about the area itself. They did an amazing job keeping our room clean, and on the one day that we left the &quot;Do not disturb sign&quot; on, they left us a note saying they'd be willing to come back and clean at a more convenient time in the evening if we'd prefer that. Great service!Rooms:The rooms were CLEAN, and were a pretty good size for Europe. The bathrooms seemed to be brand new - great shower, really big tub. The hotel puts emphasis on people being quiet within the hallways - with the combination of that and the durability of the rooms, we NEVER heard another customer and had no outside noise whatsoever. The TV was one of those 17 or 19&quot; LCD televisions about the size of a computer monitor, but we never used it since we were so busy touring.Misc:We took the Eurostar one day to Paris and back again - this hotel is perfect for doing that, since you're so close. I highly recommend it. Also, the price of this hotel was in line with the Travelodge we stayed at in the Liverpool Street area - but the value was so much higher! Also as an aside - the breakfast was good (they were also really polite), fairly priced and with a lot of food and a cool dining facility. . and it's also worth mentioning that the pub that is attached to the restaurant area of the hotel is great! Good selection of beer, lots of TV's to watch the local Rugby game, and quality British food (Sausage and Mash, Beef Pie, Fish and Chips - all the staples plus everything else you'd expect!) at a great price. An excellent place to unwind at the end of a long day!I 100% recommend this hotel. Great location, excellent service, great price. How can you go wrong?"
56,1064,"May 29 2009 	great hotel great location great price	We choose this hotel because of its location  2 min walk from Kings Cross Station and St. Pancras International. We arrived to London at 11 am and decided to go to hotel to ask if we can leave our luggage there. We were positively surprised that we could not only leave our luggage there, but we could check in at 11 am. The room was spacious, modernly decorated, clean, and quite; the bed was huge and comfortable. The all you can eat buffet breakfast was very tasty and worth of money. The staff was friendly, nice and they answered all our questions.There is a restaurant in hotel  but we did not try. Next to the hotel there is Tesco, Starbucks, and many fast food restaurants.I would definitely stay in this hotel again and I could recommend it to everyone."
57,1064,"May 21 2009 	good hotel at a good price	We enjoyed our stay at this hotel (5 nights - 2 adults and 1 child). The room was very clean and looked recently renovated. It was rather basic (little toiletries, no drawers, no minibar..) but all in all more than adequate for the price and with all what is really needed. The staff was very nice and helpful. Location is excellent being close to a major transportation hub that makes your life as a tourist very easy (especially when you are dragging tired kids back to the hotel after a day of sightseeing). I was actually a bit worried about the area and related safety, but it turned out to be no problem (Just to be clear, this is not a fashionable area in the middle of action, but it is extremely convenient).I would probably not choose this hotel for a romantic week-end, but it would be my first choice for any other trip to London."
58,1064,"May 19 2009 	Front desk need training	Everything is ok with this hotel except the communication and training from the front desk. When we checked in i told the front desk that we will be staying for 2 nights and we will be out of town so i need to put my luggages for them to keep since i will still come back and stay at this hotel for another 3 days and they said ok, the day that i'm checking out they said no, i went down to the front desk and i met an indian guy and he said ok no problem, miscommunication among the front desk people and i need to carry those luggages to St. Pancrass station for locker by myself and they didn't even offer to help me to call someone to help me even to call a cab although it's near from the hotel. When i come back after 3 days with all the luggages, those front desk ladies that said no even give me a ridiculous smile when i check in, is this how they treat the guest?"
59,1064,"May 18 2009 	WOWZER!! perfect place to stay for a trip to london	this really is a fantastic hotel. charming friendly staff, welcoming atmosphere,clean and comfortable, its also excellent value for money. Nothing is to much trouble for the staff at this hotel, we arrived at the hotel at 7am and although check in wasnt until 2pm the staff offered to take our bags off of our hands we could then make the most of our first day without being limited as to what we could do by having to lugg them around with us! when we did eventually get back to the hotel (aprox 4pm) there were staff a plenty that were more than willing to help us check in, retreive our bags for us and made conversation that didnt seem forced or &quot;part of there job role&quot;. The room was airy, clean, comfortable,quite and the most comfy bed we have ever slept in, overall i reallly cannot fault anything in our stay in the premier inn kings cross and would recommend anyone to stay there."
60,1064,"May 17 2009 	Excellent value hotel in great location	We stayed at the Premier Inn, Kings Cross on a saturday night for a trip to the theatre. Coming in to Marylebone Station we took the 205 bus from the station forecourt to Kings Cross Station and walked around the corner to the hotel - less than 20 minutes from train to bed.Check-in was very efficient with the reception staff guiding us through the self service check-in procedure. They even had a big bowl of sweets for the kids - a nice touch. Getting into the room was a bit of a challenge with the swipe cards failing us on several occasions. Surely there must be a more reliable system available - perhaps like the oyster cards on the tube which never seem to fail.Our room was a family room which was plenty big enough for four of us. Even though our room was on the front corner of the first floor right above the bar/restaurant it was very quiet. A small fridge in the room would have been nice, but other than that we had all we needed, including a safe.Covent Garden was a few stops on the Picadilly line from Kings Cross which is literally 2 minutes walk from the hotel. Coming back was equally quick from Oxford Circus on the Victoria line. In fact Kings Cross is on so many tube lines that you can get to virtually anywhere in central London quickly.Next morning the all you can eat buffet breakfast was free for the kids and 8 for us grown-ups - fantastic value and very tasty. The restaurant staff were very efficient, seemed really happy and even had time to stop and chat to the kids.In summary this is an excellent hotel in a great location. The staff are very well trained and really friendly - we will be back."
61,1064,"May 12 2009 	Perfect for all needs	I stayed at the Premier on two different occasions in the same week...once on my own, and the other once my friend got to town. Both rooms were surprisingly large and comfortable.The location of the hotel is hard to beat, just a stones' throw from the King's Cross underground station and St. Pancras Int'l. I was using both stations, so it worked absolutely wonderfully.The hotel staff were top notch, from my early check in, to altering my second reservation, to my key not wanting to work correctly. They were always BEYOND friendly and ready to help in any way they could. They also had solid food recommendations.Though you have to pay for it, the wireless high-speed internet is fast enough and consistent...though a &quot;hard-wire&quot; option would be nice...Overall, if you are in London for business or pleasure, this place is a perfect base for your needs...location, great staff, and amazing prices ensure that they'll see me there again soon!"
62,1064,"Apr 23 2009 	Excellent base for sightseeing	I stayed with my wife and 6 year old son at the Premier Inn Kings Cross for 5 days in February on a mixed business / sightseeing trip. As I had business for a couple of days in the area, I chose the hotel reluctantly, thinking that it is too far from the center for sightseeing. However, the proximity to 5 tube lines means that you can go pretty much everywhere without changing trains, including Heathrow (via tube) and Gatwick (direct train to St. Pancras on weekdays) - this is a very big plus if you have kids with you. There is a grocery store in the same block, the shops at St. Pancras are open late (some are open 24/7) and there are nice places to eat with a kid in the area (including Kitchin across from the hotel and the hotel's restaurant). So the location turned out to be great.Regarding the hotel itself, the price during the weekend was very good, but it nearly doubled during the week - probably some event was going on at this time. Breakfast was excellent (english) and considering that it's free for kids under 16, it is a bargain if you do have kids with you. The room was fine, and the sofabed for the kid was good, but heating came from a portable heater (strange) and there was no fridge (slightly inconvenient). The room was in the back, so it was very quiet. All in all, if the price was reasonable for the weekdays, I would definitely stay here again, especially with kids."
63,1064,"Apr 15 2009 	I always use this hotel when in London	The hotel is all you could ask for really. I would recommend if possible asking to have a view outwards towards Kings Cross Station, Ive been placed once on the other side overlooking a supermarkets rubbish area - not so good!! The location is ideal for the trains and for Subways, especially if like me you train it straight from Gatwick.The breakfast might be expensive, but worth it I'd say!!"
64,1064,"Apr 13 2009 	Excellent hotel	We chose this Premier Inn due to the close proximity to Kings Cross Station. It couldn't have been better located-turn left out the station, left again then a couple of minutes walk and you're there-perfect with a suitcase and family!Our room and bathroom were modern and very clean. Our bed was huge and very comfortable. Our 2 children were on pull-out beds from under ours which were also fine.We stayed for 2 nights and had breakfast in the restaurant on both mornings. It was self service-serving full cooked breakfast, cereals, fruit, yoghurts, pastries etc-there was something for everyone. At around 16 for the 4 of us it was incredibly good value-especially for London prices! The staff were all very friendly and helpful, especially some of the restaurant staff.The ONLY negative thing I could say about our stay was that our room was situated at the front of the hotel, which unfortunately was a very busy road, with alot of police sirens going past. But this didn't hugely impact on our stay. Obviously it's the luck of the draw which room you are allocated.Overall it was excellent-friendly staff, clean, modern, perfect location-we will definately stay here again."
65,1064,"Apr 6 2009 	Good value for money	Just stayed in this hotel for three nights and must say it's really good for London standards AND not too expensive either. It's right next to the King's Cross station, so you have very good connections into all parts of town. Everything was very clean and the room was nice. It might have been a bit small for two people but as I was on my own it was ok. Breakfast was fine too, although I missed some cheese; there was none on offer. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The only real downpoint is that you can't open the windows, so there's no fresh air, only the air condition. I would definitely book again."
66,1064,"Apr 5 2009 	Good location pricier than our normal	We stayed three nights in this hotel in early March. Our overnight flight put our arrival at the hotel about 7 a.m. (well before check-in time.) A very nice lady at the front desk was quick to tag our luggage and lock it away. She asked if there was anything we needed, gave us maps and answered all of our questions. We returned from our running around about a half hour before official check-in time but really tired. The same woman went to extra effort to get us a room and find our luggage which had by this time become stored behind a lot of other luggage. The room was very comfortable and clean. The bathroom also was a perfectly functional size and clean. The towels smelled of Elmer's glue, but that could have been worse. There were three of us so we were given a room with a queen sized bed and a sofa/daybed about the size of a twin. The smaller bed seemed rather an afterthought and was shoved right up to the window. The drapes blocked the light well and considering it is a major metropolitan area, the nights were pretty quiet. We are used to staying in very cheap hotels and this hotel is more expensive than we would usually pay for, but it was so close to St. Pancras and we had an early train to Paris when we left so we shelled out the extra. I think it was worth it. I would gladly stay there again and hope I can afford it."
67,1064,"Mar 30 2009 	What a find!!	My family of four went for a sightseeing weekend and opted for this hotel due to its location outside the congestion zone. We arrived early on Friday and had no difficulty negotiating our way around the congestion zone. Parking at St Pancras was very expensive, 40 for 18hrs, and a good 7 minute walk away. On Saturday we were able to park on the road directly outside the hotel. The location of the hotel is perfect, 2 mins to Kings Cross with its links to the whole city, although I did find the tubes unpleasant due to overcrowding. We were also directed to eat at Kitchin, located at the side of the hotel, which was a contemporary Thia, Indian, Chines and Italian buffet, which was very good.The staff at the hotel were absolute gems, the room spacious, modern and clean. The breakfast was fab. Our only gripe was that the heating was faulty in our room. we were provided with a portable heater which meant it was difficult to maintain a stable temperature one night. I mentioned this the next morning and we were given a full refund on that nights stay! What service! I did feel a little guilty because although I had struggled to sleep, I thought the hotel was top notch and would definately return again"
68,1064,"Mar 24 2009 	Wonderful and Convenient Hotel.	The Premier Inn at King's Cross is a wonderful hotel with convenient Tube access to virtually anywhere in the city. The King's Cross/St. Pancras station offers connections to many different lines. Moreover, if you are planning a trip to Paris the Eurostar is just a hop and a skip away. We found out the hard way just how useful this was when we woke up 45 minutes before our train was set to leave for Paris. The checkout was painless as a friendly staff member stands in the lobby and collects your card key and asks your room number. We busted a move through the lobby, crossed two streets and voila we were ready to check in for our train with time to spare. Being near the train station also means that there are convenient shops for necessities (Boots and Marks &amp; Spencers) as well as quick bites that are open late. The restaurant in the hotel offers good food at a reasonable price. The service at the hotel is amazing and everyone is attentive and helpful. A nice perk is they offer a phone card that can be purchased in 5 pound denominationsfor international calls. This was a great way to keep in touch with family and friends at home. Internet is also offered in the lobby using a coin operated system. The rooms are spacious for European standards and is comparable to many American hotel chains in terms of size and amenities. I will definitely make it a point to stay here again the next time I am in London."
69,1064,"Mar 20 2009 	Perfect for Eurostar	This is a great place to stay the night before an early Eurostar trip. Very upmarket compared with most Premier Inns and given the location the price is justified. Good staff who were struggling with the automatic check in as it wasn't working properly. The room was surprisingly big but the bathroom was smaller than usual but adequate. One negative point was that our room had a window facing the atrium, which although there were curtains had strong artificial lighting on all night which was annoying.We didn't use the bar or restaurant as we know the area and did our own thing - there are plenty of good restaurants close by. Good cafes at St Pancras for breakfast."
70,1064,"Mar 13 2009 	From a Singaporean point of view.	Majority of the staff are helpful and proactive. The beds are comfortable and the housekeeping team did a great job of clearing up the room. The location is fantastic as the quick access to King Cross equates to direct access to most part of London. We woke up to tasty and warm breakfast every morning. The room for improvement is perhaps rotating/changing the buffet breakfast items so that guests would not get bored after staying for more than 3 days in a stretch. Eg. Alternate between serving back bacon and ham, pork sausage and chicken sausage, baked bean and green peas."
71,1064,"Mar 3 2009	Handy for Eurostar	There's only one reason to stay here. It's less than five minutes' walk to St Pancras station so, if you've got an early morning Eurostar to catch, it's an ideally placed, fuss-free solution. It's a peculiarly designed building, with an atrium running through the centre. What this means is that a lot of the rooms don't have an outside-facing window but instead overlook the lobby. It's hardly ideal but, if you're only here for a night (as we were), you can live with it.You can check in at reception or at self-service machines, which dish out your room keys along with a receipt (you pay on arrival). This worked well and was certainly quicker than waiting in the queue for a receptionist.The room itself housed a large double bed but there was otherwise very little space in it. The telly was attached to the wall, for instance, as opposed to sitting on a cabinet at the foot of the bed: it was the only way to fit it in. Surprisingly then, the bathroom included a bath, with an astonishingly powerful shower over it.At 108 (not including breakfast), it didn't feel like it offered particularly good value. But it's so handy for the Eurostar terminal that you're prepared to overlook such a steep price for what is, in effect, a glorified Ibis."
72,1064,"Mar 1 2009 	The Ideal Location...	We selected this hotel as we were travelling from Scotland to Europe by train/Eurostar and it had a good rating on Trip Advisor. The location is certainly excellent - 2 minutes walk from King's Cross and 5 minutes from St Pancras Eurostar terminal. Arriving well after midnight, we found very welcoming and chatty reception staff. The room and facilities are high quality and the main atrium and bar area relaxing and attractive. Although relatively basic, you could easily pay far more for a poorer quality hotel in this part of London. Our only gripe was the amount of noise in corridors and adjacent rooms during the night which suggested that sound-proofing was fairly poor, but the hotel cannot be entirely responsible for noisy guests. The hotel was very responsive to complaints though, and they offer a money-back guarantee if they can't solve your problem."
73,1064,"Feb 25 2009 	Good Value Good Location	We spent six nights in this hotel and were well satisfied. It's a new chain (at least to us) with a dozen or more locations in London and probably hundreds across Britain. We were pleased with the location we chose. We were a block from Kings Cross and St Pancras stations, and you can't be much more centrally located in London than that. The hotel was completely satisfactory in every way, and a very good value for London. As has been noted by others, the rooms are a little smaller than average but we found ours perfectly adequate for the two of us.The breakfast buffet (not included in the room rate) was also good value for people who need to begin the day with a big meal. For coffee and muffins, there is a Costa coffee shop off the lobby. We can't think of anything negative to say about the Premier Inn Kings Cross and will probably choose this hotel again on future visits."
74,1064,Feb 18 2009 	Basic Hotel with Excellent Location and Service	I had booked this hotel for 5 days after reading the reviews from tripadvisor and I was travelling with my family and all of us were very happy with the hotel.Location is very good and near to Kings cross tube and eurostar terminal and there is a bus stop close to the hotel.Service is very good right from the reception to restaurant.The staff are young and are very helpfull.We had breakfast all days at the hotel and it was wonderfull although the negative point was that it was the same food on all days.There are lots of food outlets close to the hotel.The rooms were clean and being a budget hotel was small although we did not mind it very much.Overall was very happy with the hotel and would recommend it to all.
75,1064,Feb 16 2009 	Recommend Premier Inn King's Cross/St Pancras	We stayed at this hotel for two nights in February on a short trip to London.It's central location within a minutes walk from the King's Cross underground station cannot be beaten. It's also a pleasant 30 to 40 minute walk from the hotel through Bloomsbury to Shaftesbury Ave and onto Trafalgar Square. The hotel itself is great value. The rooms are small but spotlessly clean and the beds are so comfy I slept like a top on both nights. We had dinner in the dining room on one night and a buffet breakfast in the morning set us up for the day.In particular the young staff were pleasant and helpful beyond the call of duty. I will certainly return.
76,1064,"Feb 10 2009 	From an American	This was my first trip overseas and my first experience at a hotel anywhere besides the U.S. and Canada so my perspective may be somewhat different as I compare the Premier Inn here with the standard hotel/motels in the U.S. I found the staff extremely, friendly, courteous and helpful. Even the chef who prepared the hot breakfast buffet was a cheery fellow who engaged us in a friendly chat each morning. Our breakfast was included in our Thomas Cook match-break package, but the selection and quality of the entrees was as good as anything you can get in the U.S. I'll ditto some of the comments both pro and con I've read here: the room key cards often do not work, there is no wash cloth in the bathroom (unthinkable in any U.S. motel), the rooms are very clean and tidy, virtually no noise, the staff kept our bags secure before our official check-in time, and it is very close to the Kings Cross transportation hub from which you can get virtually anywhere very quickly. We used the tube to get to and from Heathrow. No problem. Maybe this is common in Europe or England, but we found the electrical system quirky. You had to insert your room key into a slot to operate any of the lights or electrical outlets. When you pulled the room key out, you had just a few seconds before the lights and power went out again. I didn't know this and left my son in a darkened bathroom with unfinished business. The kind where you have to stand and aim too. Also, I learned that a twin bed isn't separate twin beds, but two twin mattresses, each sheeted separately but on a single frame. My single bed was also two twin beds sheeted together. Also there was no blanket the kind we would recognize, just some kind of bedding material enclosed in sheets. Again, something you would never find in the U.S. There were no bureaus, drawers or even a clock. Again . . .  But we were very happy to stay there and would come back again. I just loved the staff and their friendliness--something unfortunately you rarely find in the U.S."
77,1064,Feb 2 2009 	Great location and good quality hotel	Extremely convenient location. Choice of reception desk or self service check in. Good breakfast.Only fault was cold corridors but room cosy.Would return and recommend
78,1064,Jan 25 2009 	The chilled out atmosphere	This is a very nice budget hotel. It has a lovely modern atrium and a great value restuarant and bar which serve good quality food at very resonable prices. I had really nice veggy sausages and mash at the same price I'd pay at the pub. The staff were delightful and youthful and fun and could not have been sweeter.The room was comfortable and smart but budget and a little simple. It is a very modern and upmarket Premier Inn and not at all like other ones I have stayed at.The hotel is practically on the platform of Kings Cross Station and very handy.
79,1064,"Jan 12 2009 	Comfortable basic hotel	I have stayed at this hotel many times for business as we have a coroporate account with the chain.Premier Inns are pretty consistent for having a comfortable bed, clean bathroom and delivering adequately with no-frills.Showers usually work very well, you get tea and coffee but little else. I've always found it quiet despite the location.This hotel does now have an automated check-in facility - just pop your credit card into the machine and it pops out your room key and receipt. This is very quick and handy.The only problem I have had on many stays here is once when my TV didn't work. I have eaten in the restaurant a few times and it's nothing special, but unfortunately there's no actually a great choice of other places to eat around the hotel. It's mainly takeaways but there is a Tesco express at the back of the hotel. Leaving the hotel and walking away from the main station there are some reasonable bars that open late, but no place that stands out for recommendation.I do feel that 120 for a weeknight stay is a little expensive for these type of hotels, but in London even the Travelodges are 109 during the week!If you don't mind being a little further out then the Premier Inn at Putney bridge is a better and cheaper option. Nicer area and far more choice of restaurants, nicer pubs, etc."
80,1064,"Jan 5 2009 	Good location for Eurostar	Clean, neat hotel, everything in the room worked, room not too hot, staff efficient and pleasant. We were up early in the morning to catch the Eurostar so we didn't try the breakfast. Plenty of places to eat nearby. Price reasonable-for-London (i.e. slightly less of a rip-off than most). The roll-out bed for our child wasn't very good quality, though, and the room was a bit cramped with it laid out."
81,1064,"Jan 2 2009 	New Year's Eve	Booked Jan 2nd 2008 for the New Year's Eve celebration in London. Checkin was busy, but used the new self service kiosks which were easy to use. A very helpful staff member came by to make sure everything was OK with the check in process and explained the procedure for getting into the hotel after midnight.The room was a bit basic (eg you dont get drawers) but very clean and comfortable and well worth the 110 rate for a central london location on NYE.I didnt use the restaurant/bar but the there is a Costa Coffee on the entrance which was very welcome on New Year's Day morning."
82,1064,"Dec 8 2008 	spot on!	We paid 244 for a family of 4 to stay 2 nights bed &amp; breakfast. We were very impressed by this hotel which was literaly 2 min walk from tube station.The bed was very comfortable. We booked a family room 267, there was no view but we really only wanted somewhere clean &amp; comfortable to stay.Drinks in the bar were very good value. We did not eat in restaraunt however we heard lots of people say their meals were very nice.The rooms were very clean, spacious &amp; decorated well.The breakfasts were lovely &amp; all staff in this area were very friendly &amp; could not do enough for you.We checked out of our room before the correct time (12) &amp; was offered to leave our bags in a room provided by the hotel. We would not hesitate to come back."
83,1064,Dec 5 2008 	how could you beat this!	Took the wife and kids to london for the first time and booked here over the internet. i have to say that i wasn't expecting much (as we were working to a budget) but boy was i so wrong! From we arrived till we left the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Food top rate and cheap all you can eat for 7.95 and the kids eat free! i would say forget about the more expensive hotels this place has all you would want and being close to the underground you are never far from anywhere in London.
84,1064,"Nov 17 2008 	Loved this hotel	This hotel is excellent. I did think it was a bit expensive but considering how well placed it was etc I couldn't really complain! Was so clean, fresh and cosy. Drinks were ridiculously expensive though even for London i think. For some reason the hotel hadn't told my friend her card had been declined when she booked 5 months earlier. This was a bit of a problem as we then had to scrape money together that was for spending. Wished they had said it had been declined at time of booking as it would have been so much easier. We hardly spent any time in the hotel just because we were so busy on our 2 day trip of London. When we needed a taxi to go to the theatre we asked at the desk and they put a light on to tell taxis to come in and get us. This was great!Overall a good experience!!!!!!"
85,1064,"Oct 29 2008	Pretty good value for London	We just stayed at this property and can globally agree with the positive comments.PRO:- convenient location, very close to King s Crossand St Pancras- plenty of underground connections available- modern hotel- comfortable room- good breakfast buffet- A/C was working properly- bathroom fairly ample and very clean- though much higher that a normal Premier Inn in the country, was still good value for London- good to be able to leave luggage in a secure place after check-outCON:- we booked a family room, we obtain a normal room and a mattress on the floor for our son ... - room is small for 3 people- as in most hotels in London the staff is very young unexperienced and foreign - but here the staff was speaking understandable English ..., they have to do everything, e.g for the breakfast, seat the guests and clean the tables as well ... ensuring long queue in the morning of grumbling patrons- room was pretty noisy the double glazing was good but not sufficient to ensure a quiet night- cards to access rooms and lobby was not wroking well, had to go frequently to front desk ... to complain and have it changedGLOBALLY POSITIVE"
86,1064,"Oct 22 2008	In the Shadow of St Pancras	The Premier Inn almost invariably represents good value for money in a central London setting. I stayed here for three nights in late September 2008 at a cost of circa 110 a night. My room was compact, comfortable and well insulated against the street noise outside. The Premier's proximity to the tube at St Pancras (about 500 hundred metres away) also makes it (and London itself) highly accessible.If I had one small quibble, it is the Premier Inn's tendency to instal Lux liquid soap containers above the bath. Yes, they can serve as soap, shampoo and body gel, all rolled into one. But there's something very proletarian about this scrimping attitude to toiletries. It would be so much better if they had a nice selection of small soap bars, shampoos and bath gels.As one reviewer has already noted, the Premier breakfast is exceptionally good value and sets you up for the day. All you can eat of either Continental or English breakfast for the highly competitive rate of 8. I have yet to find a hotel in London which matches the Premier's price in this regard.But the really special thing about the Premier is that it is only a stone's throw away from the newly renovated St Pancras International station. And that station is fast becoming a new London attraction. The architectural design of the station (with huge swathes of glass forming its roof) is a wonder to behold. And the giant statue of the two lovers embracing is fast assuming iconic status. Not to mention the movingly affectionate statue of Sir John Betjeman, clutching his hat in strong winds.There are also some great restaurants in the new St Pancras Station. The St Pancras Grand (opposite the Champagne Bar) has won many rave reviews from the critics (though I did not sample its pleasures myself). But I dined a couple of times in Le Pain Quotidien. It has a great selection of freshly made soups, meat pies, steaks and other dishes (including an eclectic selection of wines and beers). All served in a wooded room resonant of a small French bistro (though adjacent to main thoroughfare which cuts through the station).I'm really glad the Sir John Betjeman saved St Pancras for posterity. And the renovation of the station has breathed new life into the entire King's Cross Area. From a place of ill repute, it has now been transformed into one of London's gems. And, as I observed earlier, the Premier Inn is located in York Way, just about 500 metres away from the magnificent station at St Pancras."
87,1064,"Oct 14 2008 	London Gem	We stayed here 3 nights, October 8th-11th, 2008. Cost is 115 for weekdays and 90 for weekends, including taxes. This hotel is a rare gem in London, it offers a new (by the look of it) hotel across the street from Kings Cross station. Kings Cross is a transportation hub with 6 London Underground lines going through it and any number of over ground trains to many places in north-east UK.The staff here are very friendly, the hotel itself is about 6 storeys with elevators. Its cool in design, with a large atrium where the lobby and check-in desk is. The rooms are by North American standard tight in size, however completely functional; the ensuite bathroom has a tub/shower in it. Our room had a huge king size bed with ample storage space below it for suitcases etc. There is a hanging closet with about 8-10 hangers in it, however, there is no other storage for clothes in the room, either hang them up or leave them in the suitcase! There was also a safe at the bottom of the closet however they are not functional at this time but expected to be in the near future. There is a desk for working hung on the wall with a business chair for writing or computer use. A warning about the room phone, you need some special prepaid Premier Inn calling card to use it and THERE IS NO PUBLIC PAYPHONE IN THE LOBBY! Use one of the ones across the road at the station.The full English breakfast (additional 8 each, kids under 16 free) is amazing. Its an all you want breakfast bar with bacon, eggs, sausages, baked beans, fruit, yogurt, cereals, toast etc. Well worth it.Stay here with confidence."
88,1064,"Oct 13 2008 	Exceeded expectations	I took a group of customers to this Hotel for four nights of sight seeing in London. I had read some of the great reviews on trip advisor and thought it looked like a good bet based on it being in the top 30 of popularity. Booking online was easy and all confirmations were sent quickly. I started to have second thoughts days and considered changing hotels before the trip because I had read that Kings Cross was a so-so area and there were a few mediocre reviews. What a mistake this would have been!The hotel is excellent from the second you walk in. First it is a very easy walk from the tube and train station making it easy to get around anywhere in London. The neighborhood is lively and felt safe. We got to the hotel 4 hours before check in and upon arrival a very nice gentleman came from behind the desk to ask if he could hep. We mentioned we were early and would like to store our bags and he happily obliged taking them to their secure bell room. When we returned in the evening we were quickly checked in through the electronic system with the help of another staff member. Our rooms were all excellent......very clean, roomy (by london standards) with king size beds, a nice desk/dressing area decent size tv and a good size bathroom. It's not five star, but for 100 pounds you shouldn't expect it to be - having said that, I would rate the service we received as world class. We took the breakfast option for 7.95 pounds and I would highly recommend this. It is a hot buffet with lots of options and it is in a nice windowed room on the main floor. The food was excellent and it was a good way to start and plan our days.There is a good restaurant/pub and a coffee shop in the restaurant and many in the neighborhood. There is an excellent restaurant next door called Kitchin which serves an all you can eat buffet of Indian, Thai, Chinese and Italian. They will custom cook in front of you as well and for only 12 pounds we thoroughly enjoyed it on two nights.All in all, this was one of the best hotel experiences I have had, and considering the price, the location and comparables in London, you can't go wrong with the Premier Inn King's Cross - Book it with Confidence."
89,1064,"Oct 6 2008 	Good choice	I booked a twin room in this hotel, for 9 nights in september. I had some problems at checking-in (their kiosk didn't work) but sorted it out. We had a nice room, with comfortable beds, but sometimes it was too warm inside and had to turn on the air conditioning (which was a bit loud). The tea and coffee making facilities were good, specially for me as i love tea. Also, the iron and ironing table provided was much help.Everything was very clean. We took our own shower amenities as we thought they didn't provide it, and it was the right thing to do. The hotel has a very convenient location; we took the tube everywhere!. Also, a small supermarket is nearby. About the breakfast, it was a good english breakfast, but i'm not used to it so i didn't try the hot food, just the cold stuff. It wasn't too impressive for me as it didn't include cheese or ham, but it could be because they focuse in the hot food. The juices were great tough!.One thing that happened during our stay was the fire alarm got activated at 7AM, and we were conducted to the outside of the hotel. The process was quick, and after a few minutes of lack of information, they told us that a guest smoked in the room (which is totally prohibited and it is clearly said in several places in the hotel). I felt the hotel staff handled the situation well and i felt safe. Staff was friendly and polite, altough they didn't provide good information about internet access or printing services for a couple of pages we needed to print. We found a good option near Tothenham Court, as we couldn't find any place near the hotel. Overall, it was a nice stay, but maybe for a 2 or 3 day stay."
90,1064,"Oct 6 2008 	Can't beat the location	Had a one night but long weekend stay in the &quot;Smoke&quot;. Was the first time we had stayed here and found it absolutely ideal, especially if your using Kings Cross or the Eurostar.We arrived at 11am and we were allowed to check in immediately which was a relief, because i do know of some London hotels where they charge for the privilege.Hotel was clean, modern and had the usual Premier Inn purple everywhere.Breakfast was about 7, but we declined.The usual noon checkout applies but you can leave your luggage in a secure room, again another bonus.All in all a very enjoyable stay."
91,1064,"Oct 3 2008	good Location	Booked a family room, for myself and two teenage daughters. The third bed is adequate but very small for a tall teenager. Main bed very comfortable.For price in London the hotel is good and the location to main train station is the attraction. You can check out and leave luggage until returning to go home on train.The room is compact but a bit cramped when three people trying to get ready. Breakfast was good and plentiful with under 16s eating free.The main problem we had was that the room was very stuffy and hot during the night making sleep almost impossible. We couldn't get the air conditioning working or the windows open, my daughter had an important interview in the morning and lack of sleep was not conducive to a good interview.Filled in the feedback form and complained to staff re stuffy room and lack of sleep. Advice given was that we should have come down for a fan. !Given that their policy is that they guarantee a good night's sleep, i did expect some feed back but have had none."
92,1064,Sep 23 2008	great choice	I choose this hotel because I was getting the 07.01 Eurostar. An extremely pleasant girl helped me check in and an equally pleasant young man checked me out.. My room was lovely and I had an excellent and very reasonably priced meal. I will definetely use this hotel again and will also be very happy to tell friends about it.Thank YouJoy Scott
93,1064,"Sep 22 2008 	Great location very good facility	Very convenient location, only 1/2 block from the King's Cross station. We showed up late (midnight) but were greeted right away by friendly, efficient staff. Room was fairly spacious, including the bathroom. King bed was comfortable. Property was clean, cheery, very purple. Nice breakfast room; plentiful breakfast. Would stay here again, if we had the chance."
94,1064,"Sep 16 2008 	Great budget hotel	Stayed here due to closeness to St Pancras for a Eurostar trip ( that never happened but thats another story), allowed to check in early, staff attentive, room clean , quiet , breakfast excellent."
95,1064,"Aug 29 2008 	First timer!	This is the first time I have stayed at a Premier Inn and did so as my daughter and her friend were travelling to Paris on the Eurostar at 6.30 in the morning so I wanted a hotel near by.It was really very very good! Clean and spacious rooms and we had 4 in the room inc 3 teenagers!!!Very helpfull and polite staff, really I could not find anything to fault the place.Excellent value for money. I would stay again."
96,1064,"Aug 17 2008 	No surprises and very plesant	Stayed at this hotel for one night before going to France on the Eurostar early the next day. The hotel was reasonably expensive for a Premier Inn, however being in central London next to a major rail station this is only to be excepted. Having said that it was considerably cheaper than any other hotel we could find within a similar distance of St Pancras International station. The hotel itself is very nice, clean, tidy and looked pretty modern. The staff where friendly and helpful with any questions we had. The hotel has a restaurant attached to it as well as a Costa Coffee shop. We used the restaurant for an evening meal and it was pretty expensive for what it was, but again you are paying for the location more than anything else.There was nothing to complain about with respect to the room. It was an average size for this type of hotel with standard en-suite facilities. The room was clean and tidy and had everything we needed.Overall, nothing special but well priced for the location and everything was as expected."
97,1064,"Aug 5 2008 	Good location	Great 10 mins from Euston Station, clean rooms tv/tea/coffee...bed comfortable, quiet of an evening.......great location for the tubes......would use again....breakfast extra at the pub next door....recommend"
98,1064,"Jul 28 2008	The best place I ever stayed	all I can say is wow. the rooms, customer services, automated check in etc., everything fabulous. keep it up kingscross"
99,1064,"Jul 28 2008 	Fantastic value for money	We were looking for a hotel in central London and having read the information provided in the premierinn.com website we decided to book this hotel. The location was ideal and from the minute we checked in until we checked out, we were honeslty so impresed with the staff in this hotel. They just could not do enough for us, we have a 2 year old and theyteam really made her feel special. The rooms are spotless and extremely clean and believe me I am paranoid about cleaninless!The breakfast was absolutley great value for money, in central London, 7.50 for all you can eat and our daughter eat for free, I simply could not believe it.This was the first time we stayed at a Premier Inn and we were delighted with this hotel and the staff we just fabulous, cannot recommend it enough!!Maria"
100,1064,"Jul 26 2008 	Can't be faulted	We stayed here for one night with our two and four year olds. The staff are excellent and friendly, and the rooms clean, big and comfy.For a hotel in the middle of London, this place cannot be beaten."
101,1064,"Jul 23 2008 	Excellent Stay	I stayed here with my wife and children 5 &amp; 8 for 4 nights in a family room (1 king bed, 1 fold out double). The room was equal to anything of the same price in Australia, very very clean. I heard no noise from other guests and found the staff to be excellent. The breakfast was excellent and well worth the price of $15 AUD per adult with children eating free. The location is very convenient for travel on the tube and to get to and from the major airports. After travelling around Europe for a month, this was the last stop and by far the best hotel, it was also the cheapest at $200 AUD per night. I would highly recommend any person who is after a very clean and confortable hotel in london to consider the Premier Inn London - King's Cross."
102,1064,"Jul 22 2008 	Great Hotel and a great location	I stayed in this hotel,with my partner, over the weekend (Sat-Mon) at the beginning of July 2008. Having stayed in a few Premier Inns over the years I was expecting the same standards as I have seen in the other hotels, and I have to say I was not disappointed.The check in staff were excellent. Made me feel like a valued customer and not just another &quot;number&quot;. Gave me clear directions to my room and informed me of breakfast times in the restaurant.The room was on the 4th floor over looking the main road and Kings Cross railway station, The station is currently undergoing a renovation and I was concerned that the road noise coupled with the noise from the building work would disturb us. But the room had adequate sound proofed double glazing so much so that the road noise was only a faint sound if you listened really hard! The room itself was bright and airy and very clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. It had all the usual ammenities, tea/coffee facilites and TV with freeview etc. There was an air conditioner in the room which did work rather well. We left it on while we were out and the room was nice and cool on our return, However that been said it was making some rather unusual noises and was very &quot;rattley&quot; and a bit asthmatic, so we had to turn it off to sleep as it would have kept us awake.The breakfast in the morning has the usual good selection. Various types of cereals that you can add an assortment of dried fruits to should you wish, croissants, toast which you do yourself, plus all the bacon, sausages, beans, mushrooms you can eat. They will even cook the eggs to your liking. The coffee left something to be desired as it was a little weak and tasted like it had been left to stew too long, but you could always use a sachet of Kenco and just add hot water from the dispenser if you wish.Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay in this hotel, which is something you would expect of a Premier Inn. I would not hesitate to use this hotel again, so much so that I have already made a reservation again for the first weekend in August."
103,1064,"Jul 22 2008 	really good	we (2 adults, 2 kids under 10) stayed for 7 nights this july 08. only 95 metres from kings cross, conteporary design. staff very firendly and welcoming esp with the children. they take time to really speak to guests. kids get an activity pack upon arrival,which realy wins them over. room is adequately sized even with two beds on the floor for the kids, lcd tv (remote wasnt working) . all clean throuout the 7 days. had little snafu with credit cards but staff really came through. really difficult fo fault and particularly recommended for families with young children."
104,1064,"Jul 19 2008 	Below expectations	We stayed in one of the family rooms at the Premier Inn Kings Cross St Pancras for five consecutive nights in July 2008, having based our choice of hotel to a great extent on the large number of positive and even enthusiastic reviews on TripAdvisor. We were two adults and two girls, aged fifteen. However, our experience was very different from the picture which is given in most of the reviews here.The hotel does have some good points, but also problems, and quite a few of those. We did not in any way expect any kind of luxuries, just a decent budget hotel, but we still found the Premier Inn to be a disappointment.To begin with the good points: the hotel is kept clean throughout. Breakfast (an extra  7.50 for adults, free for children under 16) is perfectly alright, though in no way sensational, but it offers plenty of choice. There is a kettle, tea bags and tea cups in the room, which is nice. The location is excellent, a mere 2 minute walk from Kings Cross station, where you will find buses and underground trains going in almost every direction. There is a Tesco Supermarket and an ATM in the very same block as the hotel, on the corner of Caledonia Street and Caledonian Road, and a lively pub on the opposite corner. There are plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance, many of them on the southern side of Grays Inn Road, as well as an Internet Caf if you need that (we did). Last but not least, most of the people working at the front desk are very nice, efficient and helpful.However, what is being advertised as a family room suitable for two adults and two children under 16 is actually a fairly spacious double room, with two additional mattresses laid out on the sides of the double bed, in sharp contrast to the description on the Premier Inn homepage, where you book for children under 16 in beds. To make it easy to stow the mattresses under the bed when they are not being used, they have been made considerably shorter than the bed, and were not really long enough for our teenage girls, who found the arrangement unsatisfactory and disappointing in several ways, not least because they could feel the springs in the rather thin mattresses when lying on them. The double bed itself was alright, but the available floor area became very limited with the extra mattresses laid out, and thus, there was not really enough space for four suitcases. Also, there is no real closet or wardrobe in the room, so you have to store most of your clothes in your suitcase. The ceiling height is very low  no more than 2.3 metres, at the most  and all windows in the family rooms are non-opening, according to the front desk this is for security reasons. Our window had a view of the pitched roof on the adjacent building, no more than four or five metres away. All in all, the room felt slightly claustrophobic and congested, quite a bit like the cabins on the cruise ships going between Stockholm and Helsinki on the Baltic Sea.The bathroom had a tub with a fixed shower which worked well once you had figured it out. However, the bathroom was designed to be used by no more than two persons, and therefore there was no place to hang the two additional towels (we were given four towels). Nor was the ventilation in the bathroom designed for four people showering directly after each other, and you had to keep the bathroom door completely closed while showering because otherwise the steam could set off the highly sensitive fire alarm, so our bathroom rapidly took on the appearance of a sauna every morning. Not being able to open a window at these times was rather frustrating.The housekeeping was literally out of everything. When we arrived at the hotel, there were four tea cups in the room but only two glasses, and since it was quite late, we decided to use two of the cups for our toothbrushes, and the next morning, we told the front desk that we would like two more glasses in our room. Somehow, this message did not get through: when we returned in the evening, there were two new glasses and four new cups on a tray, while our toothbrushes had been scattered around the basin in the bathroom as if they had been litter. I have stayed in a number of hotels on four different continents, ranging from five-star establishments to the very simplest, and I have never encountered anything even remotely similar. Even in the old Soviet Union, the privacy of your toothbrush was respected. The beds had been made, but our nightgowns and nightshirts etc. had been crumpled together into a ball and then placed on top of one of the mattresses on the floor. When we went to the front desk to explain that we do not appreciate such treatment of our personal belongings, they were very sweet and helpful, and promised to take care of the matter promptly, which they did, and the toothbrush incident was not repeated. However, the housekeeping was full of surprises and highly inventive in their treatment of our nightclothes, to say the least: one day we found our items on top of the pillows, one day under the pillows, one day spread out over each other on the back of the chair and one day on the desk. And one evening when we came home, we found an empty pillow cover on the basin. And when the soap container in the tub/shower was empty, it wasnt refilled. I could go on, but I think you get the general picture. To be sure, there are far worse hotels in London, really bad ones. And to be fair, the problem is not so much the hotel in itself as the expectations which are raised by the Premier Inn homepage as well as by some the reviews on this website. If you are on a budget, travelling with young children, aged 10 years or younger, and if you are prepared to put up with erratic and unpredictable housekeeping as well as the other issues mentioned above, booking a family room at the Premier Inn Kings Cross St Pancras is certainly worth considering. However, do not expect too much. And you should by all means consider other available options as well, because I believe you could find something else which is just as good or even better for the same price. As for me, in spite of the excellent location and the helpful and considerate people working at the front desk, I will look elsewhere for accommodation the next time I visit London."
105,1064,"Jul 1 2008 	The best place to stay in London!	The Premier Inn at Kings Cross is located near St Pancras station and Kings Cross station. It is located in the business district. This hotel does have air conditioner! The staff is wonderful and very helpfull and friendly. It does get a little noisy if your room has a window on the street. But overall, its a great place!"
106,1064,"Jun 27 2008 	Very convenient	I often stay in Premier Inns whilst visiting family and friends, or on business. They offer a good, consistent standard.I had never stayed in one in London though.I stayed on my own whilst in London for an awards dinner. It is so convenient to the Kings Cross station. Literally 100 yards from the entrance. No need for a taxi. Handy for tube connections all around London.The hotel is clean and bright and well furbished.Check in staff were helpful and friendly and discreet when giving me my room number (always a concern for a woman travelling alone)An ideal hotel for a one night stopover (as on this occassion) or a short sightseeing break in London (maybe next time....)The only downside was a musty smell in the bathroom that I tracked down to a slightly mouldy shower curtain"
107,1064,"Jun 25 2008 	Close to everything!	I was really looking for a nice budget hotel that won't be too hard to get to and Kings Cross was perfect! From Heathrow, just take the Picadilly line and next thing you know, you're in Kings Cross station. No need for confusing train transfers. The hotel is just a few steps away from the busy station and yet, it's quiet in the hotel.Aside from being near to the tube, there's a Tesco at the back, a few pubs, lots of places to eat nearby. The bus even stops almost across the hotel so if you don't feel like taking the train, the bus is great.The hotel staff are FANTASTIC. Friendly and helpful. The room is generously sized. There are extra pillows and towels. The thermostat can be switched to warm (very important for a Manila girl like me!). There's TV with lots of channels, a strong shower (too strong actually so that it pounds on your skin), a tub, hot water, a hot pot, tea stuff, etc. And the all-you-can-eat breakfast is quite good.Obviously, I loved staying here!"
108,1064,"Jun 25 2008 	A Good Find	On the way back from conference in Bournemouth we decided to break our journey in London. We had not booked anywhere and walked in to the Premier Inn off the street, We were offered the internet rate and given a room on the top floor.The hotel was great, modern and trendy. The staff on reception were friendly and helpful. The room itself was functional with a massive comfortable bed and nice bathroom. All in all good value for money and in a handy location."
109,1064,"Jun 24 2008 	What I Expected	I last stayed here a year ago. It was for 2 nights and it was a positive experience, so this time I decided to spend 3 nights. Check-in took much longer than last time, despite the front desk being fully staffed. I think it may be due to new employees. I was given a much bigger room than last time. There was only a view of the back of another builidng and a construction site. I booked breakfast with the room, it is still 7.50 pounds for all you can eat. The orange juice is the best I've tasted in the world. Don't use the vending machines, before checking it is OK. There was a malfunction that takes your money but doesn't dispense the item that you selected. When I checked out, a girl at the front desk offered to store my bags and wished me well."
110,1064,"Jun 24 2008 	Excellent budget hotel	Stayed there for total of 3 nights in 2 visits. Was welcomed very warmly and allowed me to check in at 9 am even though the policy is 2 pm. Very helpful when you fly for 23 hours total! Staff were all warm and helpful. Room was very clean and spacious for London standards. Air conditioning was the only downside as it was slightly cool. My preference is to be on the really cool setting. However, this will not stop me from staying again at this hotel. Other highlights: 1) extremely convenient location with many tube lines and even Eurostar just a block away. Only one train from the airport (Heatrow) to King's cross ( Picadilly line). 2) Despite the super busy location, the hotel is located in a very quiet side of an otherwise busy neighborhood. No noise in the room. 3) The breakfast ( add 7 pound 50) was very good for the price ( again, you are in London; a McDonalds Breakfast is close to 5 pounds). The croissants were unusually good! Reminded me of freshly baked croissants in France Also, the sausages were of good quality. Scrambled eggs just a little too watery/ liquidy. The help staff in the dining room were mostly students but all very gracious and helpful. Verdict: Will definitely stay again!"
111,1064,"Jun 17 2008 	great find- ohio traveler	we stayed at the premier inn kings cross june 1 and june 2. we were looking for a clean, affordable hotel that was within walking distance to the tube and St.Pancras. this hotel was perfect on all accounts. we flew into gatwick and took the First Capital Connect train straight to St.Pancras( only 24 euros for all 5 of us including travel passes on the tube). From St. Pancras, we walked through Kings Cross station, across the street and right into the hotel lobby. The lobby is a large, modern atrium. We could not check in at 11am, so they stored our bags in a large room behind the check in desk. We booked two exterior rooms on the third floor and were not disappointed. Both rooms looked brand new and were very clean. The showers worked great and the beds and linen were perfect. The comments about the place being very quiet is absolutely true. We paid $30 a day for all five of us to eat breakfast in the hotel(kids 15 and under are free). The breakfast was well worth it. They have a wide assortment of food including omelettes, bagels, toast, etc. My only complaint is that they didn't have skim milk, but no one else in europe did either. There is also a coffee house on the other side of the atrium if you want. The kings cross/st. pancras tube station is right down the street and has more tube lines running through it than any other station. we only had three days to sightsee, so being close to the tube was key. The staff was very helpful and more professional than most hotel staff in the U.S. If you are looking for an old fashion Victorian era hotel, this is not your place. This a new, hip looking hotel that was much cheaper than many other hotels and perfect for rail connections. We took the 3:30 Eurostar on to Paris, which meant we could sightsee until 2:30, grab our bags from the lobby and walk right into St.Pancras for the train. No expensive cab fares or worrying about missing the train. The area around the hotel and St.Pancras has a lot of construction going on, and I suspect it is going to be a great destination in 3 or 4 years. Special tip: The British Library is two blocks from the hotel and has a room called the &quot;the treasures room&quot;. It is free and has two original prints of the magna carta, several Shakespeare sonnets and the original scribbled words to several Beatles songs. The kids loved it."
112,1064,Jun 17 2008 	Way better than Best Western	After staying at the best western on the way over we found premier inn a true delight. London standards are way different from the US and way below our par but thanks to trip advisor I found this nice little hotel to stop over in. The beds are way better than best western and the hotel is nice and the rooms are good for a stopover. I wouldn't spend more than a couple of days here but nice for stop overs. Skip the best western. Oh and book dinner or breakfast buffett - it gets crowded quickly. Take the gatwick express into town and take the shuttle to the airport.
113,1064,"Jun 10 2008 	Surprisingly good	I stayed here for one night on a business trip. The room was very large and well-appointed - probably the best Premier Inn I've stayed at. It's not in a pretty area and not really walking distance from the main tourist attractions, but is in a great location for train and tube links.There are a few noisy pubs nearby, but the music died down before midnight. Very good value for money."
114,1064,"Jun 9 2008 	Beats everything in the area in this price bracket	Stayed one night on business. Delighted by short walk from Kings Cross (about 100 metres). Greeted by happy, helpful staff. Everywhere in the hotel was very clean, everything worked and the room was suprisingly quiet considering the hotel's location. There's not much else to say that hasn't already been said in other reviews on here, it ticks all the boxes."
115,1064,"Jun 8 2008 	A gem! Highly recommended!	I'm from the U.S. and this was my first trip to London. I didn't know what to expect and chose the hotel based upon it's proximity to King's Cross/St. Pancras. What a great choice!! It is right across the street from those stations, as well as the Piccadilly line (King's Cross tube stop)--this is the main line for Heathrow and many sites, or provides easy transfers to other lines. I thought the location was excellent for all of my site seeing and theater-going. The hotel is very clean. The staff was VERY friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and clean. All rooms are non-smoking (I was told this when I requested a NS room). I had a room that was along the exterior side of the hotel and had some construction noise, but I was up early anyway (and one would presume the construction will not last forever). This was such a pleasant surprise--I booked it somewhat blindly based on location and was hoping for &quot;passable,&quot; so I was so glad to find such a gem. I will most definitely stay here next time solely based on the the quality and excellent location. Tips: bring a travel alarm as no clocks in room. The hotel does not hold bags overnight, but there is a place called &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; in St. Pancras (across the street)that holds bags for 6.50 a day--I did this for my trip over to Paris as I didn't want to haul all of my bags. (Though they will hold bags on the day of your arrival/check-out; again, very friendly and helpful). I usually hate the transfer from train/airport to hotel, so this location is great--right across from the Piccadilly (Heathrow) Line, National Rail, and Eurostar Stations."
116,1064,"May 28 2008 	Fantastic 'budget' hotel	Stayed here on two consecutive weekends during my time in London. I was very impressed with the quality of the rooms, for a 'budget' hotel; huge bed, very modern, and very good size bathroom with all the necessary amenities. I also opted for the 7.50 all you can eat breakfast which was excellent value for money.Location is ideal for getting around London as it is very central. There is also a Tesco just down the road if you forget anything. Parking wise, after 1:30pm on Saturday there is free parking on the street for the rest of the weekend.My only negative point was on my second stay, the room was too hot, as I got a room which doesn't have a window which opens to outside. (In certain rooms the window open to inside the hotel, due to the design and shape of the hotel). There is air conditioning in the rooms but it wasn't very effective.However I would definitely stay here again. Great hotel, great value!"
117,1064,"May 24 2008 	Very impressed	We stayed for 2 days in a double room in April and couldn't fault the room, service or standards of cleanliness we experienced during our stay. All of the staff were extremely polite and helpful and also very knowledgable about the facilities and local area.The room itself was a good size and the bed was the best of any budget hotel I have ever stayed in. My husband and I are both very tall so we usually suffer in a standard double but the Premier Inn bed was huge with good quality linen and pillows and was extremely comfortable.I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and we will certainly stay again in the near furture."
118,1064,"May 19 2008 	Friendly and pleasant hotel	It is a really great place. The location is perfect, just off the Kings Cross/St.Pancras tube. We even got a room at 9:00, were able to leave the bag and be off to the city. The staff is extremely friendly, attentive and helpful, both at the reception and the restaurant. Twin room was very small, but clean and functional. Breakfast was tasty, well organised, a lot to choose from. Kids eat free with paying adults. One evening, we ate at the hotel restaurant, and the food and service were great. They willingly agree to store the bags after check out, which is great, too. For a budget hotel, it should be one of the best options in town. I will definitely stay here again next time."
119,1064,"May 13 2008 	Make sure you get an external room	Ok, so it is budget accomodation I would have to class it.. but when you are guaranteed a non smoking room, and don't get it?? Kinda a problem. We are both non smokers &amp; I have slight asthma that comes back every now and then... I had looked around at so many hotels in London and because it was only 1 night before we flew out, it didn't have to be too cheap.. Because we know that cheap in London doesn't equal quality... Well, that's what I found anyway..It wasn't too bad I would have to say. Not the cleanest hotel we have been in, but clean enough.. It was meant to be a double bed... But we were given two singles.. We did complain about the smoking room, and we got a free dinner... I guess that was ok.. I was really hoping to switch to a non smoking room, as that's what I was confirmed.. The food was ok, we ate out most of the time and had pub meals as they were cheaper &amp; much tastier!If you are looking for budget accomodation that is.. better than most of them, stay here... Just watch out as many hotels in London are seriously overpriced.."
120,1064,"May 12 2008 	Great CIty Base	We stayed at this premier Inn for one night (a Saturday) in May. We were in London for the weekend and needed a bed for the night. This hotel, like all the others in the chain fills its promises. We use them because they are reliable in their predictabilty, and we know exactly what to expect. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, checkin was speedy- our room was ready at 12.00- although officially checkin is at 2.00pm so we were able to dump our bags and get on with our day straightaway. The room was extremely clean as was the bathroom. Yes it was small, but we had no intention of wasting our trip to a very hot and sunny London in in our hotel room, so it made no difference to us.We actually chose the hottest weekend of the year to be in London, so everywhere was packed and extremely hot. We had a brilliant day, saw a great show in the evening and then later really appreciated a short tube ride and just a two minute walk to the hotel. The location of the hotel is great, very handy for the tube, although if we hadn't done as much walking as we had during the day, we could easily have walked there, people do forget how close everything is in London, to actually walk rather than taking a tube is a great way to see the city. We had a great night's sleep, we had no disturbance from road noise at all- complete quiet- we did use the air conditioning unit- on the &quot;quiet&quot; setting and we found it to be very efficient at cooling the room and yes it actually was remarkably quiet., it certainly did not stop us getting to sleep, We did have the breakfast in the hotel the next morning, we decided to have the poached eggs, these were prepared for us while we waited, and were cooked perfectly. The entire breakfast buffet was very well organised and was constantly replemished. As busy as the hotel undoubtedly was on such a scorcher of a weekend, breakfast still felt unhurried and relatively peaceful.All in all this was the perfect place for a city break without breaking the bank. As long as you go knowing what to expect.I think some overseas, especially American guests book thinking they have found a bargain, but not realising that this is actually a budget option, there is no romance or character in any Premier Inn - but you get that in bucket loads in London and for that matter in the entire UK , itself.We couldn't fault this hotel and would happily stay again."
121,1064,May 7 2008 	great hotel good location	this hotel is great its just near kingscross train station and the under ground it has a good bar and restarante the i dont have a bad word for this hotel.
122,1064,"May 5 2008 	Best Value Hotel in Central London	At around 100 this isn't the cheapest budget hotel in London but is is consistently good and in a great location right next to the trains and tubes and in up-n-coming Kings Cross.You always know what you are getting with Premier - good quality, a good night's sleep promise and clean, stylish rooms. The courtyard layout in this complex is a delight and I have had several nice evenings (before a day's business) camped out in the bar whch does reasonable meals.They also appear to have banned smoking now - getting rid of that bizarrre situation in some places where you have smokers' rooms on the same floor!I always try to do breakfast too - they even make you porridge if you ask.Book it...if you can!"
123,1064,"May 4 2008 	Convenient clean and comfortable	I stayed at the King's Cross Premier Inn for one night in early May, and like previous reviewers, found it a good choice. Check-in was efficient, and my second-floor room was quiet and, by London standards, fairly spacious. All the essentials were right: the bed was comfortable, the shower worked well, and everything was spotlessly clean. The TV offered all the Freeview and several radio channels, and there was a good WiFi signal, though I didn't use the WiFi service because of the cost. The windows didn't open so I had to use the airconditioning (which was efficient and not too noisy) - not very environmentally sound, but in London open windows do mean a lot of noise. The location, just by King's Cross mainline station, was very convenient. All in all, a good near-budget hotel for a short stay; my only criticism is that the bedside lights weren't bright enough to read or work by, though the desk lighting was adequate."
124,1064,"Apr 22 2008 	Good place to stay for trip to Paris	Stayed in this hotel on April 1st, 2008. Arrived at hotel after an 11 hour trip from California. Can reach hotel via the Piccadilly tube line from Heathrow. Once on the line, the trip to Kings Cross takes one hour approximately. Once at Kings Cross and outside, the walk to the hotel is about five minutes or less. the area around the hotel is very busy with people, cars, trucks and construction. Once you enter the hotel lobby however, you do not hear any of the outside congestion. At check-in, the front lobby staff were wonderful. We asked for a quite room and were given a room on the 2nd floor facing the courtyard of the hotel. The room was very small and difficult to to walk around as it was very small compared to American standards. The room was very clean and the bathroom was neat and clean as well. We had breakfast there one day and for the 7.5 pounds we thought it was expensive but worth it.We did not use the in-house WiFi however. If you just want to check your email, walk outside to the mail street and across from the Kings Cross station, you will find the British Post Office. Inside the post office there is a private company that has a row of computers for rent. for about 1.0 pounds, you can check your email for 20 minutes.We would stay here again if we were going to go to Paris or for that matter spend more time in London. If your going to travel by bus or the tube, make sure and buy the &quot;Oyster Card.&quot; you save money and its very easy to use."
125,1064,"Apr 21 2008 	Great stay great value.	My wife, my two children and I just completed a 9 night stay here and we were very happy with it. I picked it after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and I'm very glad I did.The staff were all very friendly and check in was very prompt. Our room was on the 1st floor, in the interior. It overlooked the small courtyard in the middle of the property. The room was very clean. It was also incredibly quiet, especially for a city hotel. We had what was called a family room. It was two twin beds attached together, and on either side was a mattress for each kid. The kids actually thought that was great, compared to having to share a bed. The beds were clean and comfortable. The kids had no problems sleeping on their mattresses. I was there in April when it was pretty cool, and I had no problems with the heating system. I can't comment on the AC.With four of us in the room with luggage for 10 days, it was a little tight but we didn't have any problems. We primarily used the room just to sleep after long days of sightseeing. The room had a nice flat screen TV with an ok selection of channels.I have read pros and cons regarding the breakfast, and I have mixed feelings. We had it a few days. Since one adult could pay the 7.50 and the kids ate free, it was one of the cheapest choices. Here's my note of caution - I'm American, and what I consider standard for our breakfast buffets wasn't at this one. No pancakes, waffles, french toast sticks or doughnuts. The choices were good, but I guess more traditionally UK. That wasn't so good for the kids.There is a Costa coffee shop just outside the lobby, a MacDonalds, Starbucks and KFC really close by. There are also a number of other restaurants in the area, plus places in the Kings Cross and St. Pancras stations. The neighborhood seems to have a lot of construction going on as it appears to be growing to support the arrival of Eurostar at St. Pancras. My wife and I felt completely safe in the area, and we were out past 11 on some nights. The convenience to the rail and Underground stations (&lt;5 minutes) was excellent and a huge plus.The few quirks:- The lighting (as others mentioned) is a little dim. It wouldn't be great if you were doing a lot of reading or writing.- There is a lack of storage. There was a closet and a series of shelfs, but no drawers. The room had a great long desk, but it seems a waste not to include some drawers with it.- The step into the tub is (as others have mentioned) pretty high. I wouldn't recommend this room for the elderly or anyone who would be challenged with this step.- No alarm clock in the room. You ask at the desk and they give you a small travel version for the duration of the stay.Overall, I was really pleased with the facility. I thought the overall value was hard to beat. This was one of the most affordable hotels I could find that was well rated and within easy access of the London sights. This is not a five-star hotel. If you want amenities, look elsewhere. If you want a clean, comfortable room, with a great location and a reasonable (for London) price, I highly recommend this."
126,1064,"Apr 12 2008 	Half 	I stayed here twice this month (April 2008) - once on the way from London to Paris and once on the way back.The first time was brilliant. I need internet access and although it was 12 for 24 hours, at least I could get on the net. A nice little TV, nice furniture, good breakfast. Avoid dinner in the restaurant - the dinner was ridiculously overpriced and absolutely disgusting, I ordered fish cakes, which looked and tasted like onion bhajis. Greasy, nasty little things. I had one bite and was almost sick.The second time, I was out in a different room, where most of the TV channels didn't work, the kettle didn't work (it had a failed safety inspection do not use sticker), the toilet door didn't close and the toilet smelled upon arrival. Not pleasant at all. For 125 for one night (BREAKFAST NOT INCLUDED) I wasn't impressed.It's an alright hotel if you just need to stay there for one night and a very convenient location (I was getting the Eurostar to Paris - just a 5 minute walk from the station), but it's definitely not worth 125 a night. And it's an extra 7.50 for breakfast. All I can say is that it's a rip off, but alright if you;re desperate."
127,1064,"Apr 8 2008 	Cant fault the place	Stayed here for 2 nights over a friday and saturday night and paid 90 a night on their own website. Thought this price was ok for London.I picked this hotel as it was close to Euston Railway station, we walked there with some cases with wheels, about 10 minutes. There is a tube about 50 yards from the front of the hotel(Kings Cross) which we used a lot. The welcome I received from Victoria was outstanding just so friendly and gave the impression that nothing was too much trouble. The family room we had was clean and fairly standard, the beds for kids were mattresses pulled out from the large main bed, the kids said not too uncomfortable.We had breakfast at the hotel which was excellent, the porridge is the best I have ever had and again the staff here are just so helpful. We had to wait 5 minutes for a table on the Sunday morning but this was ok and well organised.They do provide wifi at the hotel but as there was a charge I went to a Mcdonalds about 30 seconds away where they offer free wifi.Check out was quick and they held our bags for us for about 6 hours. Watched the football on Sky at the hotel bar.Overall another great stay at a Premier Inn, recommended."
128,1064,Apr 4 2008 	the best for london	The best place to stay in London!! Perfect for families and perfect to get to the tube considering The main tube station is only 2 blocks away!! The breakfast is fabulous and keeps you full for hours and added plus considering the american dollor is so weak!
129,1064,Mar 31 2008 	clean and tidy	Stayed just one night. Room clean. Staff were very efficient and very courteous. Room we were given (room 8) was near the staff rooms so we had a door that shut every few minutes and was very noisy! Got very little sleep because of it. Very central for all attractions though and 5 mins from Euston.
130,1064,"Mar 30 2008 	Top Shelf Premier Inn	I have stayed at 3 Premier Inns and found them all to be great values, but this facility was the best of the three. The location near King's Cross provides easy access to trains &amp; tubes. There are many eateries in the area and a Marks &amp; Spencer in the St Pancras station.My room faced the interior building court and was very quite. As with most Premier Inns, the room was large clean, and fresh. Why would you stay anywhere else when visiting London or other UK cities?"
131,1064,"Mar 29 2008 	Wonderful London Bargain Hotel	Our family of four (girls 6 and 11) spent three nights here over spring vacation. This is a very pleasant hotel that's great for families. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They even found a dentist for us on Saturday, when our young daughter suffered a minor emergency.The rooms are very small (think cruise ship cabin) but very clean and comfortable. The beds have duvet style covers, so that all bedding your body touches has been laundered. No dirty bedspreads!The resturant was pretty good and the prices were reasonable, even by american standards. King's Cross isn't the best area but it's a short tube ride anywhere in London and a short walk to the British Museum. For a family, this is an outstanding place to stay."
132,1064,"Mar 27 2008 	Above average	Easy to find from tube station, reception staff very friendly + helpful. Rooms bright, very clean and comfortable. Good breakfast. Could not complain about anything."
133,1064,Mar 27 2008 	Functional but prices have risen	I have stayed here three times.This place is fine - Last time I stayed 4 nights and had no major problems. It is well located - 2 mins from King's Cross/St. Pancras.The beds are nice and the hotel is very clean. Food is not bad in the hotel and there are a few nice places to eat within a 20 minute walk. Staff are very friendly.However the prices have risen recently and I don't feel it belongs in the budget category anymore.
134,1064,"Mar 26 2008 	Excellent stay - highly recommended	We stayed at the Premier Inn Kings Cross for one night at the beginning of March 2008 and can't recommend it highly enough. For a family of four with a 18 month old baby spending the weekend in London, the hotel was perfect.Arriving on Saturday morning at St Pancras International, the hotel was a five minute walk away and although we couldn't get into the room until after 2pm, the helpful staff took our cases and locked them away while we were left to explore London.We returned to the hotel at around 7pm and checked in speedily. Our room, on the first floor, was spacious and clean. The travel cot we had requested was set up with plenty of bedding. Despite there being a huge double bed and pull out single bed, the room didn't feel cramped and there was plenty of room to store our bags and pushchair.The on-suite bathroom was spotlessly clean with enough towels for all of us. We were surprised at the full size bath with shower which was very powerful!The first-floor room we stayed in was at the front of the hotel an although we could hear some traffic noise in the night, it didn't interrupt our sleep.The hotel's facilities are excellent with a restaurant, public house and Costa coffee off the lobby. Although we didn't eat in the restaurant, the menu looked very inviting.Breakfast was fantastic - buffet style with a large selection of cereals, fruit, pastries and a full English cooked option. Our two children were well catered for and certainly didn't go hungry. The breakfast was excellent value - particularly as the children ate for free. The staff were very friendly and helpful and really did ensure we were well looked after.On the morning we checked out, we could leave our bags securely in the hotel, returning in the afternoon to collect them before we caught our train.If you're travelling to London for the weekend with a family, I really recommend the Premier Inn Kings Cross. The location is excellent, staff courteous and helpful and breakfast fantastic. We would certainly stay again."
135,1064,Mar 22 2008 	Clean hotel at good rate for London	This hotel was very clean. We had two rooms. The rooms are large and the bathrooms are also good size. It was located near the St. Pancras station which also is the station where Chunnel trains from Paris arrive. The price of the room was very good. Other hotels in London were much more expensive.
136,1064,"Mar 16 2008 	Excellent Value for London	I stayed at the PTI King's Cross for two nights after reading the recommendations on this site. The rate was about 100 per night plus 7.5 breakfast. It sounds expensive, but this is London for you.My friend and I arrived fairly early, before the recommended check-in time, but the very helpful lady at reception found us roooms anyway. Following advice from other travellers on this site, I asked for quiet rooms, facing away from the train station, so she gave us rooms facing the internal courtyard. The rooms are very nice, clean, new, all decorated in purple tones (my favourite colour!). Not too small for London standard, perfectly ok for 1 or 2 guests anyway. I had a TV, hairdryer, air-con/heating unit (a bit noisy though), kettle with cups, tea/coffee/biscuits and a telephone that allows you to make outside phone calls with a credit card number. Ironing boards are available in a facilities room on each floor that you can access with your room card.I have stayed in many hotels but was the quietest room I've had in a long time. I didn't hear any doors slamming or any noise from adjacent rooms. The bed was very very comfortable too. The hotel is brand new and the lobby looks great, it's like an internal courtyard with seating, a restaurant/bar with a mini-Costa Caffe' corner. A proper branch of Costa is accessible just outside the front door. Reception is open 24 hrs but after a certain time you need to swipe your room card to get in the main doors, or buzz reception. This makes the place feel very safe, and even each individual floor corridor is only accessible with your room card.Breakfast was very good value, with an unlimited buffet offering continental and cooked choices, and Costa coffee on tap. Service was superb, much, much better than many 4 stars hotels I've stayed before. For a middle-level chain like Premier Inn, this hotel really is an example of things should be done. Other London hotels should really take note and learn.I will definitely stay there again next time I need to be in London overnight."
137,1064,"Mar 16 2008 	Very Good - Exceeds Expectations	I stayed here for one short night on route back north from Heathrow - I missed the last train. The location is perfect for Kings Cross and St Pancras Stations, only a few yards away. I have stayed in Premier Inns in many places in the UK, including the one down the road at Euston. They have steadily raised their game, and the Kings Cross Hotel is a prime example of how this chain have improved the quality of their hotels and service levels.The facilities are excellent, and the staff were all warm and friendly including the night staff who checked me in at midnight. The room was spacious and quiet (I was a bit worried as I was near the lift lobby - but I never heard a thing). The bed was huge and extremely comfortable.I had breakfast (all you can eat - 7.50) which also exceeded my expectations. The buffet was well stocked and all food was of good quality (including the sausages which were excellent - far better than the usual cheap sausages usually provided on buffet breakfasts).Just one gripe - at 125/night this really isn't a budget hotel, but all in all it is highly recommended. Well done Premier Inn, and look out Travelodge!"
138,1064,"Mar 12 2008 	Good location nice hotel	This hotel has a lot going for it. Decent price for London, great location near the Kings Cross/St. Pancras station, nice staff, comfy (but small) room, good restaurants attached. Don't go there looking for a glamorous neighborhood - it is definitely all about proximity to the station. But once inside the hotel, everything was calm and peaceful - very nice."
139,1064,Mar 6 2008 	Brilliant - great location	We stayed here for one night in February. I'd only been to London once as a child so I had no idea where to stay and where everything was located. I am so glad I chose the Premier Travel Inn - Kings Cross as it was the prefect location - 2 mins walk from the staion and tube so we easily got to see the city.The room was lovely and clean - bed was comfortable and even though we were on the main road the traffic outside wasn't bad at all. I never heard a noise from any other residents. Bathroom was clean and spacious - towels clean. We had plenty of wardrobe space - only stayed one night though. We had breakfast here too - all you can eat for about 7.50 and it was lovely. The staff were very friendly and polite. We ask to leave our bags there while we went sightseeing on the day we checked out and this wasn't a problem. I also noticed that they had little lockers where you could charge your phones etc which I thought was a wonderful idea.All in all I would stay here again and I am thinking of doing so in the near future.
140,1064,"Mar 4 2008 	Location Location Location!!	What can I say! Stayed here 20th - 24th Feb for a long weekend break with my significant other and daughter (aged 4).100 yards away from Kings Cross and tube just over the road, this was an superbly located hotel for seeing all the sights!Ate in the resteraunt every night and the staff couldn't have been more polite and were so attentive to the bairn it was difficult to get her back upstairs!! Food was excellent - bit pricy though but it is London after all.Checked in and fron desk allocated us a top floor quiet room, which we requested. The receptionist even let us chose which room we wanted on a floor plan!!Room was spotless, beds were comfy, tea and coffee making facilities, large bathroom. Room was cleaned and towels changed daily.Walls are 3 foot thick so you don't hear other travellers coming and going - a good nights sleep had by all!Would definately stay here again!! 10/10 Premier by name Premier by nature! Never saw Lenny Henry though!!!:)"
141,1064,"Feb 29 2008 	The flagship Premier Inn	This is the best Premier Inn you'll ever come across. Its brand new, so everything is fresh, modern, and stylish. For a Premier Inn, its pricey, but for London, its not bad at all.Location is good and bad. Kings Cross isn't the most fantastic area, but it is undergoing redevelopment so it will get better and better over time.If you're after Kings Cross or St Pancras railway station, this is your place, its right next door. If you're after the sights of London, the Kings Cross St Pancras Underground (tube) station is also right next door, which will almost take you anywhere in London with 7 intersecting lines.This would be a great choice if visiting London, you'll be getting a very nice modern hotel with links to anywhere in London, for an affordable price."
142,1064,"Feb 21 2008 	Great Location	I stayed in this hotel for a week in October. I think the location is great because it's literally a minute away from Kings Cross station, which can pretty much get you to anywhere in London. Also, the Kings Cross Thameslink station in just a few minutes away and you can go to many places from there(like Brighton).As far as the hotel, it was pretty good. I shared a double room with my friend. It was a bit small, but nice. The bathroom was a good enough size. Cleanliness was good overall, and all the staff seemed nice and friendly. My room was on the 2nd floor and the window in the room was facing other rooms. So there was nothing great to look at...but that didn't bother me. I liked how you have to have your room key in order to get to where all the rooms are. Kings Cross can be a bit of a crazy area sometimes...so that was good.As far as the area itself... it's not That bad and I never felt unsafe. It's a busy area and there are always alot of commuters around. Like I mentioned earlier it's a good location to get around with all the trains and buses. There's is a Tesco(grocery store) right around the corner, there are fast food places, a drug store/chemist(Boots) at the station, and there are a couple restaurants(Indian, Italian and Chinese, etc) in the area too. I would definiately stay there again."
143,1064,"Feb 21 2008	Great value excellent location for Kings Cross/St Pancras stations	Excellent location for Kings Cross station, less than 2 minutes walk, really easy to find coming out of station onto York Road. Reception staff were very helpful - we arrived earlier than the 2pm check in time but were able to check in straightaway and were given our room keys to deposit our bags. Hotel also had a baggage storage facility and were happy to look after our bags after checking out on the final day. Room and bathroom were clean and very quiet. Great value for a hotel in London."
144,1064,"Feb 17 2008	Does what it says on the tin	Polite &amp; efficient reservations staff, clean room, comfortable bed, good breakfast. Could not fault."
145,1064,"Feb 15 2008 	A lovely stay!	We decided to stay in this hotel for Valentines as it seemed to be the most convenient - just a few minutes away from St Pancras Station. However, when we got there, it turned out to be a lovely hotel! The room was spacious and had everything we needed and more.The staff were friendly whilst checking in/out, and have been helpful after as they are posting something back which was left in the room!Overall this was a great stay, in a great location - had no issues at all!"
146,1064,"Feb 7 2008 	Stay here you won't regret it	After reading reviews of several hotels, shopping on several web sites, we chose to stay at this location. We had previously stayed at other Premier Inns (or TravelInns as they used to be called) including County Hall. While County Hall is a great location for tourists it was not close to my work in the City. Kings Cross is 1 block away from the station and well positioned for the train to Paris now that it departs from St. Pancras next door. While in a busy area, it is amazingly quiet. One nice thing is that Kings Cross is on the Piccadilly line so if you are coming in from Heathrow by Tube you don't have to change en route. Just stay on the tube and an hour later you are there. There are other lines that run thru Kings Cross like Northern Line and Circle Line so it is very easy to get to most of London from one location with a minimum of changes.We arrived late on our first night and do to some confusion had to wait while staff converted a twin to a double room for us. After about 10 minutes we were shown to our room AND given a free breakfast the next day for 2 for our inconvenience. The breakfasts at Premier Inns are all you can eat buffet with hot and cold items for 7.50 GBP. This worked out to be good value for us as we could fill up on breakfast and skip lunch or just grab a small snack to tide us over till dinner. All the items in the buffet were fresh, well stocked and there is a very broad selection.Many have commented on the wireless available to purchase. I only read about this after purchasing the wireless as I needed to work in the evenings. After an hour of extreme frustration with the speed (SLOW) I gave up and sent an email for a refund. However, I then tried using my corporate VPN to see if that even worked. For some reason I can't explain, when using my VPN the wireless was great! I sent a follow on email explaining I did not need a refund. Did not receive any reply to either email so not sure what would have happened had I not had a VPN to use. That being said, the wireless is not cheap. I paid 24.00 GBP for 1 week. This seems high but since I could expense it and work from the room it was worth it.The rooms are well sized for 2 and ours had the &quot;double&quot; bed, small desk with desk chair, small TV and a fully fitted bathroom. They are in the process of upgrading the rooms and ours received a new bathroom floor during the day when we were out. Not sure why because everything looked very smart when we checked in.All in all, for the price, consistency, level of customer service, and excellent location we would highly recommend and will stay here again."
147,1064,"Feb 5 2008 	Excellent value	Stayed at this hotel 2nd Feb for 1 night after returning from a trip to Bruges we had travelled on the Euro Star so the hotel was very well postioned for us. We didn't know what to expect but had checked 1st with Trip Advisor so hoped it wouldn't let us down (it didn't ) Check in brill the young man was very helpful and friendly. The room was really clean and had everything we needed the bed was huge and very comfortable. Had a meal at the hotel and it was really good. We couldn't have asked for more, we would definetley use this hotel again"
148,1064,"Jan 29 2008 	Excellent value - great hotel	This hotel definitely lives up to its reputation in previous reviews (which was why I booked it).First of all, their price is absolutely fabulous, considering what you get for it AND especially compared with other central London hotels.It is right in the centre of town and extremely well accessible(literally across the street from King's Cross/St Pancras train and tube station), but nonetheless very quiet.The room was sparkling clean, with not a fleck of dust to be seen and the bathroom was shrubbed and looked very clean and hygienic. The size of both the room and the bathroom is ample (while in London I visited somebody else staying in a large luxury hotel who paid much, much more and his room was actually smaller!).The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful all the time (although admittedly I did not have any special requests/complaints).I did not take their breakfast option (you have to pay extra), and I did not peruse their in-house restaurant/bar, which was actually quite lively in the evening, with obvious non-residents joining in the fun. It wasn't rowdy or anything, just quite lively.I did enjoy the fact that they have a coffee bar on the premises and made use of their offer at least - lots of other bars and restaurants in the area, by the way, King's Cross has improved a lot recently!Anyway, this hotel is definitely a two-thumbs-up-recommendation!"
149,1064,"Jan 21 2008 	Great hotel- perfect next to King's Cross/ St. Pancras	The reviews that I read about this hotel are very accurate. It is a nice place, which is probably the MOST convenient hotel to the King's Cross station. Other hotels nearby are in much less safer-appearing areas, as about 2 blocks from this hotel the neighborhood gets dicey (or dodgy if you're British). However this hotel is on a well lighted street and I never felt uncomfortable. My room was very quiet. The only comment that I have is that there is no room service, but there is a restaurant in the bottom of the hotel. You can go down and order and then they will call you in your room to come and pick up. The food is outstanding. I had a Caesar salad with chicken that was really delicious. I was there on a Fri. night so the bar scene was really hopping. However, it was comfortable to be there to order and pick up food. I highly recommend this hotel."
150,1064,Jan 11 2008 	Very Comfortable and great Value	This hotel is great value and was very comfortable. Check in was quick and easy. The room was large and very comfortable. The whole pplace was spotless. It's definitely above average for a budget hotel.
151,1064,"Jan 6 2008 	Great find	I stayed here with a friend for 2 nights in early December. I was very impressed with the hotel. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Our room was overlooking the courtyard so very quiet. The breakfast was good and I would have no hesitation about recomending this hotel for a London break. Excellent value, excellent location."
152,1064,Jan 6 2008 	Jolly Good!!!	What a fantastic hotel!!! - My husband and two children aged 11 &amp; 9 stayed here on our recent stay in London. We had caught the train from Paris to the nearby St Pancras Internation Station. The hotel is perfectly located and only a couple of minutes walk- much to the delight of our children carrying their luggage!! The room was very comfortable and quiet. The staff very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was a real bonus as children eat for free with their parents. The selection and quality of food offered should be commended and was definitely one of the best we came across during our 5 weeks abroad. The hotel is also perfect for travellers departing/ arriving from London's Heathrow airport- travel on the Piccadilly line - with a short walk to the station and a fare of only 4 pound per person (kids travel free) it is absolutely perfect. We will definitely return and have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this great hotel.
153,1064,"Jan 3 2008 	Very nice surprise	This was my first trip to London for some years and I was not looking forward to it. My opinion quickly changed when arriving at this relatively new hotel though. Friendly and efficient check in and I was pleased my request for a quiet upper floor room was no trouble to them at all. The hotel atrium was busy but not crowded, with a nice buzz from the easily acessible bar and coffee shop. Majority seemed to be business types, but certainly families were evident and appeared very comfortable. My room was standard but very clean and I was pleased to find an iron and board in situ and that the TV was working. Bathroom was compact but immaculate, as was the room after housekeeping each day. I used the bar for just a pre-dinner drink in the early evening and found a quite good selection of wines and beers; the draft lagers I sampled were fresh and well kept, with prompt and polite service. The restaurant was popular and I was met at the entrance each evening with a smile and a few friendly words, which are always welcome to a solo traveller. Table service was very friendly and efficient. Menu was limited but very well priced for London - options of two courses for around ten pounds or a more ambitious three courses which could come in under fifteen pounds. Simple choices - soup to start, sausage and mash, fish and fries etc were reasonable sized portions, freshly cooked and nicely presented but you are chosing from a budget menu, so don't expect high value ingredients. Still, most pleasant. Breakfasts were again from a standard buffet, with a good selection of fresh fruit, cereals, bacon and eggs etc. Everything carefully cooked and well presented, if once again, ingredients chosen to a careful budget, but nonetheless at 7.50 again very good value for the capital. I slept well and was pleased to see high levels of security inside the hotel, with keycard access to floors as well as individual rooms. My only frustration was a lack of ventilation. The room was well heated, but being from the north, I prefer a cooler room for sleeping. Checkout was prompt and efficient. One note - if you need a cab, the hotel is on a one way street and just beyond the station entrance, so commuters get first call on passing taxis - you may find you have a wait at busy times.Otherwise - a very nice surprise; good value and I am returning shortly."
154,1064,"Dec 7 2007 	Ideal for early Eurostar departure	This Premier Inn is ideal if you've an early Eurostar departure, it's less than ten minutes walk away.The hotel is excellent value for money; clean and tidy and as quiet as any central London hotel can be.Would I stay there again - definitely!!"
155,1064,"Dec 6 2007 	Excellent hotel in a good location	For value for money and location this hotel really has to come tops - it's modern, stylish and an all round brilliant base for a trip to London. The bathroom wasn't perfect, but it certainly wasn't anything worth making a fuss over. The room itself was great - the window looked out into the central undercover courtyard but there was no noise at all. When we aksed for an iron we were directed to a little cupboard a couple of doors from our room where there was a store of irons and boards that you could just take to your room and then return to the cupboard - really convenient and it was nice to have a proper ironing board to use. We had dinner in the restaurant the night we arrived because it was late and it was really pretty good, not amazing but certainly good enough. Breakfast was good too, plenty of choice. Check in and check out was easy and friendly. Perfect for the British Library which is just a couple of minutes walk away and of course Kings Cross Station. I am tempted to stay here every time I go to London now because I think I'd be hard pushed to find anywhere comparable for that price range."
156,1064,"Dec 6 2007 	Recommended	Me and my partner spent 2 nights here in early December - selected this on the basis of (a) proximity to St.Pancras (our train's arrival point)(b) links to all major underground lines(c) good reviews (on this site) and reasonable pricesWe weren't disappointed - sure, it's not the most attractive or prestigious hotel, but then again, it's 90 a night for a double room. Try and find somwhere of a similar quality in London for this price.We had the breakfast there, largely due to our laziness - reasonable food quality, but not brilliant value (7.50 each) unless you're going to literally try to eat all you can.Staff were pleasant and polite, and all in all, I'd recommend this to anyone wanting a decent, basic, short stay hotel room in central London"
157,1064,"Dec 2 2007 	Good value convenient locatiion	I've stayed at this hotel several times while working in London. Location is very good for King's Cross and St Pancras, staff are helpful and the place is good value for London. Rooms are generally good, beds could be a bit more comfortable, but try and get something on the outside of the hotel as the inward facing rooms tend to be smaller and very warm in summer and on one occasion I had one where the floor mounted aircon unit made the carpet damp. Hotel has attached coffee shop, pub and restaurant. Restaurant is good value for London and food OK. Breakfast buffet is good value. Prices have gone up since the opening of the St Pancras Eurostar terminal. In some rooms it can be difficult to get a mobile signal."
158,1064,"Nov 28 2007	Great Reasonable Hotel	I stayed at this hotel over Thanksgiving weekend 2007, on an extended weekend break. I've stayed at a PTI before, and was as pleased with this one as I was with that one. In fact, I'd recommend the PTIs generally, for any traveller who seeks a hotel for short stays, more than no-frills but nothing fancy.My room was small, but there was still room for two of us to co-exist comfortably. The bed (king-size, as I think they all are) was very comfortable, and the in-room heater was adjustable. Our room was an interior one, facing the courtyard, and I'd heard that these tend to get hot, but in the London winter with an adjustable heater and a window that opened, I didn't find it hot at all. Quite pleasant, in fact. The hotel was also quiet inside and out -- no interior noise, and no noise from the exterior (although I was briefly in one of the rooms that faced out onto the street, and I could hear traffic noise). In addition, the hotel has a &quot;good night guarantee&quot;; if something goes wrong or you are dissatisfied during your stay, they refund one night's worth of your bill. We had some difficulty with our heater and ended up taking advantage of this guarantee, so I can say that no hassle or tricks are involved.My one complaint would have to be the breakfast room. The restaurant staff generally seemed to be a little less practiced than the reception staff -- who were fantastic -- so we ended up waiting for a while before we were seated for breakfast. I believe someone else has commented on the badness of the coffee here, and my companion certainly found his quite horrible. The toaster also made very raw toast, and the vegetarian sausages we ordered arrived cold. That being said, when we went to the restaurant for dinner the food was excellent and the service was very prompt. So perhaps it's merely the breakfast that's the problem.All in all, I would recommend this hotel very strongly. I was very happy there, and I'll certainly return if I get a chance."
159,1064,"Nov 25 2007	Great Value - Quiet Hotel	With the value of the US dollar at all time low, finding an affordable and comfortable place to stay in central London can be difficult. The Premier Inn in Kings Cross meets both of these criteria. My room, though smaller than the other Premier Inns I've stayed in, was very comfortable. One plus that I've found in other Premier Inn properties - the rooms let in very little street or hall noise - it's great - you close the door and you leave the madness of London's street scene far behind. The hotel is located on a side street right by Kings X station and a short walk from the recently re-opened St. Pancras Station where the Eurostar is now operating. It'd be a great location to stay in if you're planning a few days in London before heading to Paris... One weakness, the expensive breakfast didn't seem to offer that much in the way of variety. I opted for the cold continental breakfast - and noticed that both my choice and the hot buffet lacked anything very interesting. There's a Costa and Starbucks nearby as well as many nice restaurants within a five minute walk. Also, there's a Tesco Express in the same business block . Would come back here without any hesitation..."
160,1064,"Nov 25 2007 	Nothing bad To Say!	We stayed at this hotel for 2 night weekend break. As all the other review state, the hotel is in an excellent location - 2 min walk from Kings Cross tube and the area is just fine! The hotel is clean (if may be a little hot!) and the staff and really friendly and helpful.Our room overlooked the reception area on the 4th floor and was immaculate - bed was extremely comfy! We paid the extra for breakfast and it was worth it!! The resturant staff are efficient and helpful and the breakfast choice was fab &amp; fresh - better than the Hilton, De Vere, Marriotts etc. Yum. We took our car, and it is near on impossible to avoid the congestion charge - parking is issue... the NCP car park is very expensive and located quite a distance from the hotel (too far to carry bags etc and there is not really a stopping area outside the hotel) I also wouldnt be too keen to leave my car there overnight... however there are some single yellow lines directly outside the hotel (about 4/5 spaces) and you can park here after 6pm on weekdays until 8am saturdays and then again after 1pm Saturday through till Monday morning! FREE! Which worked perfect for us. I would recommend this hotel!"
161,1064,"Nov 4 2007 	It's a winner	As other posters say, this is a great location. Tube station with 4 lines just nearby and a mainline rail station. In an up and coming neighbourhood - St Pancras High Speed railstation opening soon has prompted lots of rengeneration in a gritty area.Room was clean and well laid out, quiet and a very comfy bed. Staff were good also.Great value for a great location."
162,1064,"Nov 4 2007 	No Stress.	My friend and I just spent 3 days at the hotel.Being just a very short walk away from Kings Cross Station it took all the stress of having to lift cases off and on tubes to get to a good hotel, and also gave us much more time to spend in London.We arrived, they stored our cases, we left and they did the same. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and we have never seen a breakfast table cleared so quickly in between courses.The food was very good and choice exceptional. Porridge on request at sitting down within 2 minutes.Beds were comfy and room absolutely spotless.Only one thing which was &quot;off putting&quot; shall I say. The room was an inner (the hotel is built on a square design with the Reception in the centre) was the heat which built up the room, even with the air-conditioning unit. It had a window but it was locked and we had to ask for it to be opened, they did with no problem and room fine after that. Tip for travellers who wish to stay - ask for an outside room perhaps!The hotel has its own pub and a Costa Coffee attached together with a restaurant at very reasonable prices. They even texted early on the morning we were to arrive to ask if I wished to book a table for dinner that night or if I required directions. Kings Cross used to be a dodgy area, but with the arrival in 2 weeks of the Eurostar to St Pancras, they are really pulling out all the stops to make the area up and coming. No worries at all.We shall certainly be returning to this hotel."
163,1064,"Nov 3 2007	Perfect base	Lovely hotel. Stayed there for weekend with my husband and daughter. All that we needed was there. Very clean. The perfect base for site seeing. used resturaunt, good friendly staff throughout hotel. No faults at all. Would highly recommend this travel inn . Have stayed at another since which I wasn't so pleased with at Euston London. Will definitely return here when next in London."
164,1064,"Oct 28 2007 	Nice hotel - Great location!	The Premier Inn Kings Cross did have a great location - Only 500 metres from Kings Cross Underground Station. The hotel itself were also very good. Good breakfast and good restaurant!The A/C worked perfectly and the room was big + the beds were comfy. Toilet was great too. Despite the hotel lying so central in London, there weren't much noise from the traffic."
165,1064,"Oct 10 2007	Convenient location	Stayed two nights at the Premier Travel Inn (now Premier Inn) at King's Cross in early September. The neighborhood is &quot;gritty&quot; for lack of a better word but it was good to be so close to the King's Cross/St. Pancras stations.The hotel lobby was a pleasant surprise, very nice and airy.We had a reasonably sized double room on the first floor (there are elevators). Fairly quiet though we did hear a little noise from a nearby pub on Saturday night.There was some strange odor in the room, I never figured out what was causing it. I'm not sure that the fan/AC unit was working correctly but that wasn't a problem as the temperature was in the 60's (high teens-low 20's Celsius).Bathroom was clean. The bathtub is high so you have to be careful stepping in and out.There is a Tesco Metro nearby (turn left from the main hotel entrance, then turn left at the next block onto Caledonia St) as well as the previously mentioned Pret a Manger, McDonald's and Subway. There is a Boots chemist at the King's Cross station. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant because it was more expensive.The hotel price is a good value especially considering the exchange rate. We would consider staying there again."
166,1064,"Oct 3 2007 	Decent enough that we came back	My fiancee and I booked the King's Cross Premier as the first stop on our European honeymoon. After flying in to Gatwick, it took about 45 minutes to get to King's Cross. The hotel is less than a minute from the Underground and a minute and a half from the Thameslink. The hotel itself is nothing special. Decent size rooms, comfortable beds, pleasant staff and, in comparison to other hotels in London, relatively inexpensive. The shower is a decent size, large for European standards. I have a hard time describing the neighbourhood around the hotel. There is a bar/club at the corner and being so close to the Underground and train station, some questionable locals but at no point did my fiancee or I feel scared. We walked down towards Euston and found that neighbourhood to be even more questionable. Around the hotel are a McDonald's, Starbucks and Subway. Not much to see around the hotel but being so close to the underground, there doesn't need to be.The hotel is not a 5 star venue but a decent place to stay while seeing London. We were happy enough, that we returned for a few more days at the end of our honeymoon before returning home."
167,1064,"Sep 16 2007	An all go short break	I have just returned from a long weekend in London and it was brilliant! My friend and I stayed at the Premier Lodge in Kings Cross which was lovely and comfy, clean and very affordable. The location is just 3 minutes from kings Cross station so very accessible for trains, buses and the underground. We went to see a couple of shows while we were there - on the Friday we went to see &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and on the Saturday we went to see &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; both were Fantastic! We did some sight seeing of London and there is so much to see you'll be spoilt for choice. We found a little pub just off Leicester Square called &quot;The Crooked Surgeon&quot; which we classed as our local and where the atmosphere was great and the staff although they were mainly all foreign were very friendly!"
168,1064,"Sep 2 2007 	Shame about the smell	The breakfast was good, the shower was excellent and the bed was comfy. But we had to put up with the smell of nicotine from what was supposed to be a N/S room. The first one we tried was bad but on asking for another room, the second one was even worse. We were so tired after 2 days travelling that we could not be bothered to move again, so opened the window and hoped for the best. Luckily we were there for one night only. We would not go there again, although as i said, lots of other things were good."
169,1064,"Aug 29 2007 	did I stay in the same place as the rest of you?	My 13 year old daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights in August. We had a twin room on the 1st floor. Unfortunately i did not realize until we entered the room that some of their rooms are interior rooms (there is a window that does not open which looks out into the interior hotel lobby). I was very tired by the time we got into our room (about 4om that afternoon) after a long flight, and even though I had asked for early check in (we arrived at 1pm at the hotel) they said they had no rooms available. So decided to just make do.The problem with an interior room is quite frankly the air conditioing is non existent, and extremely noisey to boot. Constant on and off running at a very noisey level. It was cool in London, but the interior room was very hot at all times. With a window that could have been opened it would have been fine with no air, But we had no window to the outside.Shower was good although bathtub was a little difficult to get in and out of due to height. But bathroom door had to be kept closed or steam could set off fire alarms!! Made for a very hot steamy room, with no fan.Soap was in the form of wall dispensers.Room very very small. I had expected small room (I have been to London many times) but be aware we could not put our luggage lying down on the floor (not enough space between wall and beds) and even standing upright, with the luggage on the floor you could only just squeeze by.Area- very handy to underground, various buses, and come Nov/07 when the Eurostar moves to St. Pancreas (just next door to Kings Cross), location will be amaazing. Area itself a little seedy still, but there is a Starbucks, McD's. KFC, Pret a manger, and nice italian restaurant just across the road.Hotel restaurant- had the breakfast once- expensive but if you have a child under 15 with you they eat free, so not bad. Big buffet style breakfast with some hot food and fair range of cold choices. You can do better but if you want this kind of breakfast and you have children with you it is not a bad deal.We ate dinner twice in their restuarnt as my daughter liked their pasta, and it was a great deal (I think 3 pounds and I believe that included a dessert). Adult meals run around 8 to 12 pounds but that would be with a coupld of courses. Food Ok (not great but good enough). Service of the meal was fast but always slow getting bill.I would stay here again given the cheap price (Ithink it was 89 pounds/night) and location, BUT GET AN EXTERIOR ROOM."
170,1064,"Aug 28 2007 	great stay at premier travel inn	myself,my husband and our two boys aged 8 and 13 stayed at the premier travel inn kings cross last week for 2 nights. we travel from belfast international airport to stansted then on by train to tottenham hale to the tube which took us straight to kings cross.the hotel is immediately round the corner from the tube station so it could not have been more conveniently situated . when we arrived at the hotel we were immediately impressed by the light and airy feel of the place.the reception staff were fantastic,they made us feel very welcome and were extremely helpful and courteous.they were lovely with the children and they were given sweets and a kids activity pack,so they were well pleased by that!our room was very nice,it was a good size for the 4 of us. a massive bed for the adults and 2 smaller beds for the kids although we could all have been comfortable in the 1 big bed!the bathroom was a good size too,with everything you could need.we think probably the best thing about the hotel might be the breakfasts although everything was great so its hard to decide!breakfast was great value at 7.50 per adult with kids eating free and what a breakfast it was! there was every breakfast item under the sun and then some and all delicious and very well presented.eat as much as you like and we did!when we were leaving to come home again we had a very positive experience. our luggage was kept for us in a locked room so we could enjoy our last day in london.the only very slight criticism would be that on our last day we got a bit wet with the heavy rain that day and we could have done with somewhere to open our cases and change into some dry clothes.the staff of couse tried to help by giving us a key for the toilet but there was no room to open the cases to look for clothes.so all in all we had a great experience staying at this hotel and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone!"
171,1064,"Aug 28 2007 	Clean spacious and comfortable - but skip breakfast	My family (self, wife and two children) stayed in London for three nights as part of a longer tour of Europe. We selected the Premier Travel Inn - King's Cross St. Pancras largely based on the price and the great reviews from TripAdvisor and other sites. Being from the US, I was not familiar with the Premier Travel Inn chain, but the hotel was as advertised - clean and comfortable, with no frills. The front desk staff was exceptional, and the location was very convenient if not fashionable (right across from King's Cross station). No safety concerns about the location, though - even though we came back to the hotel fairly late each night, we never felt unsafe. The only negative was the breakfast - green eggs, undercooked sausages, and a lousy variety of other items - not a bargain for the 15 pounds they charged each adult (kids ate free). Find breakfast somewhere else - but if you're traveling with a family and don't plan on spending a lot of time in the hotel (and why would you spend time in the hotel if you're in London?), I'd recommend staying at the Premier Travel Inn King's Cross."
172,1064,"Aug 27 2007 	Great place to stay	Stayed for 2 nights with my wife, two boys and in-laws. Hotel was clean with very friendly staff and a great location for easy access to London. Also had a free room for holding our luggage for us to pick up later on our last day. The kids stayed free and we purchased the breakfast for 7.50 each per day which is a bit pricey but the boys ate free, and the food and selection was great. We asked for an extra pillow which was given to us with no problems. We had a quite nights sleep in room 205. The only thing that I could pick up on was some rust on the shower rail. The bar was reasonably priced with Boddingtons at 2.71 a pint. I will definetly use this hotel again if I go back to London."
173,1064,"Aug 26 2007 	Pleasant an stylish	Stayed in this hotel as part of a large family group including three small children, parents and grandparents. Was pleasantly surprised by the spacious and clean rooms which were of a very good standard.The hotel is located next door to the King's Cross station which means it's very convenient for getting around London, but there is not much to see or do in the immediate surroundings.As a result of the lack of restaurants within walking distance we had several meals at the hotel, both in the restaurant and in the pub. Both were very nice, great quality food and service and good value for money!Overall this is a very good place to stay for anyone travelling to London, excellent value for money!"
174,1064,"Aug 22 2007 	Excellent value for money great location (particularly for rail travellers)	Having stayed in other Travel Inns across the Country and reading some excellent reviews on this site we decided to go for this hotel. What a excellent decision!!! Imagine our joy when we walked out of Kings Cross Rail Station, laiden with our luggage to find that the hotel was literally 2/3 minutes walk up the road. No awkward tackling of turnstiles on the tube or paying ridiculous taxi fares to our hotel. Quick walk and we were there! Even more pleased to find that the staff on Reception were very friendly, allowed us to book in early (1pm) and even gave us a double bedroom despite the fact that the operator we booked through had in fact reserved a twin room for my husband and I.Hotel was spotless. Room very new and clean, fresh towels every day and refills of tea/coffee every day. Location was excellent for travelling around London. Tube station on the doorstep with easy access to most main lines. Theatreland and main shopping areas only a couple of stops on the tube. Note: One journey is 4 so it's best to purchase a day pass which works out at only 5.10 if you remain within Zone 1 and 2 and intend travelling after 9.30 a.m. on weekdays and all day Saturday/Sunday. This ticket also allows you to travel on the buses which is an excellent advantage if, like us, you leave a packed venue like 'Lords Cricket Ground' and have the option of queing with the thousands just to get into the closest tube station or hopping on a bus and missing the crowds. In our case we only stayed on the bus for a couple of minutes, alighted at the next tube station and took a different line back to our Hotel. That's another added bonus of this hotel, there are a number of different lines running through Kings Cross, so if you know one of them's busy you can take another line. We didn't bother with breakfast but we did hear that if you're the 'full breakfast' type of person it was very good value for money. Instead we choose to pick up fruit from the 'Tesco Express' which is located at the end of the street . Leave the side door via the bar area, turn left, walk about 100 metres and you'll be there. Great for picking up a bottle of wine too, if you decide not to use the hotel bar!! We, however, did choose to use the bar on all 3 nights of our stay as the prices were quite reasonable, for London anyway. Food was average but in fairness you don't expect Michelin star in a Travel Inn. You get what you pay for! If you do want to eat on a budget or have children staying with you there is a McDonalds and a KFC literally within 2/3 minutes walk from the Hotel.This hotel also offers a 'leave luggage service' after checkout which is great news for anyone who wants to make the most of their stay in the capital and is returning home via rail. All in all it was an excellent stay, so much so that I've just booked to go back for another weekend in November."

Went down from Leeds on the train, and Kings Cross Premier Inn was just around the corner from the station, very easy to find.Check in was very quick and we were given room 112 on the 1st floor. The room was lovely, very modern and has the worlds most comfortable beds!The shower was great as was the bathroom in general.The breakfast was amazing! 7.50 each for all you can eat buffet, plenty of choice from fresh fruit salad to a full cooked english breakfast.Enjoyed the stay at Premier Inn so much have booked for NYE."
176,1064,"Aug 19 2007 	Excellent Hotel for Families - close to the tube and food	Stayed here two nights at the end of June with hubby and two children, 12 and 14. So easy to get to from the Kings Cross Station and the area was just fine for walking around with the kids. Food is only one block away, a McDonalds and a KFC, a Chinese noodle place, and a Fish and Chips shop. Hotel breakfast was convenient but not cheap. A wide variety of food was available at breakfast, but we didn't care for the sausage at all. Porridge was good. For dinner, since KFC has no where to sit and eat, we asked if we could eat outside the restaurant on their overflow tables and surprisingly the answer was yes!! SO much better to eat there than in our room - we were very pleased. We could spread out and talk without interfering with incoming guests or restaurant patrons.The hotel is clean, and reception was extremely helpful with advice. The Budget Rental Car location, even though it says &quot;Kings Cross&quot; Pentonville Road is a VERY long walk from the hotel. I regretted not taking the tube back to the airport and renting from there instead. Learning to drive in London was crazy.We booked this stay at the hotel website on their web special - pre-buy package for stay and breakfast. No regrets about the hotel at all."
177,1064,"Aug 17 2007 	Fantastic!!!!!	My husband, myself and our 2 daughters (14&amp;10) stayed here for 1 night on 13th Aug and what a fantastic place it is!!The location was ideal (2 mins away from Kings cross). Didnt see anything seedy as mentioned in a previous review even at 10.30pm at night.The staff were all friendly and efficient...the room was very comfortable &amp; spotless with a huge bed. The girls had camp beds with a proper matress on them..it was a bit of a squeeze to get round the bed but this really wasnt an issue with us. ..bathroom looked brand new...lovely hot power shower. The breakfast was amazing...absolutely everything you could possibly want.....fruit salad was gorgeous and the hot buffet was regularly topped up. YUM (excellent value as all 4 of us ate for 15!!!There is a lovely bar and restaurant at the hotel with comfy settees..this was ideal for us to go back to in the evening after the show and have a nice glass of wine or two!!!!we will definately use thishotel again and would reccomend it to everyone.WELL DONE PREMIER TRAVEL INN!!!!"
178,1064,"Aug 16 2007 	Great site-seeing base for families	My husband and I and our two children, aged 8 and 12, stayed four nights in this hotel in July, 2007. We were looking for a hotel to use as a base for our London site-seeing vacation. We didn't care about swimming pools or work-out rooms. We intended to leave the hotel in the morning and return early evening and didn't want to pay a lot of money. This hotel turned out to be perfect for us.The room was not huge, but was big enough for all four of us and our large suitcases. Several built-in storage shelves helped a lot. We reserved a &quot;family room&quot; and when we arrived, two single beds were made up and placed on either side of the king-sized bed. My kids thought they were perfectly comfortable - not sleeper sofas or fold-out cots. The room was very clean, the furniture was modern, the bathroom had a full-sized tub with shower and very modern plumbing, and there was air conditioning. The neighborhood was not &quot;charming&quot;, but we didn't care as long as it was clean, safe, and near transportation.We added two adult full breakfasts to our room rate and our kids ate free. It was a nice buffet with the standard bacon, sausage (regular and veggie), scrambled and fried eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes, beans plus oatmeal, breads, croissants, muffins, fruit, yogurt, cereals, juices, tea, coffee, etc. Everything was hot and plentiful and the dining room was bright, clean, and cheerful. However, if you didn't want to spend the 15GBP for the family, there is a brand new McDonald's on the corner plus a Starbucks and Tesco grocery store all on the same block in addition to the fast-food places in the train/tube station nearby.The hotel was very close to trains and the Tube. We came in from Gatwick on the train into the Thameslink station which was about a block and a half away from the hotel (come out of the station and turn left on Pentonville Rd. towards York Way). It wasn't a bad walk dragging all of our rolling suitcases but you will have to carry your bags up a few short flights of stairs since there's no elevator. The King's Cross/St. Pancras Tube (Northern Line) and rail (National Rail) station are even closer to the hotel, just half a block on the other side of York Way (come out of the station onto Euston Road, take a left, then another left on York Way). There was a Cornish Pasty shop in this station plus several other food stalls. We often grabbed a bite of something to take back to the hotel for dinner after coming in from central London on the Tube. The staff were all very pleasant and we met the manager standing in the lobby chatting with the guests to make sure everything was going well. We arrived early on the first day and they happily stored our bags. When we check out early the last day, they did the same. We would absolutely stay in this hotel again when visiting London. I heard that the London County Hall Premier Travel Inn near the London Eye is the company's flagship hotel and was also extremely nice, but was full when making our reservations. We ended up staying in Premier Travel Inns several other times during our vacation since there are so many of them located across the country and while they varied in price and the availability of A/C, we found them all to be clean, cheap places with nice enough breakfasts. We preferred to spend our money on nice restaurants, site seeing and souvenirs!"
179,1064,"Jul 24 2007 	Great Value for Money	My husband, 2 children and myself stayed here for one night on our return from holiday. Check in was swift and our room was large and comfortable. The location of the hotel is great for public transport. The breakfast was excellent and set us up for the day. We would definitely choose this hotel again when we visit London."
180,1064,"Jul 23 2007 	Delightful	I stayed at the Premier Travel Inn @ Kings Cross with my family (2 adults, 2 kids) for 6 nights in July 2007.First, I have to commend the hotel staff for being genuinely friendly and helpful, and they made our stay comfortable and enjoyable.The room was modern, spacious (for London) and clean. There's free tea and coffee in the room with an electric kettle.Not many hotels in London offer family room; Premier Travel Inn is one of the few that do and the rate was reasonable (for London).We love the breakfast - buffet style with plenty of food and variety. The thick toast and the fresh fruit salad were the best! Although breakfast cost GBP7.50 per person, kids eat free so it was quite good value for money for us.We got to the hotel by the Underground from Heathrow - Piccadilly Line (Kings Cross/St Pancras). The journey was about 50 minutes but relatively hassle free and cheap (for London) - GBP 4 for each adult and the kids ride free.For directions to the hotel from the Underground station: leave by the Kings Cross/St Pancras exit (not the Thameslink exit). Follow the crowd and go out of the station. At the exit, you will be looking at Euston Road. Turn left and walk in the direction of the small WH Smith bookstore and pass it. You will soon come to a 5-way junction. Make a left at this junction into York Way. The hotel is about 20m on your right along York Way - you will see a large purple Premier Travel Inn banner on the side of the building.There's a supermarket around the corner - turn left when you exit the hotel and then turn left into Caledonia Street. A Tesco supermarket is at the end of Caledonia Street. You could pack some ready-to-eat sandwiches and drinks as meals could be expensive in London.Kings Cross has been described by some travel guide books as &quot;seedy&quot;. However, we didn't encounter any problem in the Kings Cross Underground station as well as the area leading to the hotel - even after hours. Frankly, I felt more unsafe in Karlsplatz U-bahn station in Vienna than at Kings Cross.We'll definitely return to Premier Travel Inn when we visit London again."
181,1064,"Jul 22 2007 	Practically perfect.	As always Travel Inn provided everything we needed for a long weekend in London. The room and bathroom were spotless, the beds were comfortable and the location was ideal. We never really use an hotel for anything other than sleeping and washing so it was more than adequate and it would be hard to get better value for a family of four in London.There was no road noise audible from our room, but even if there had been it wouldn't have bothered any of us. I've never understood why people who stay in city hotels on busy roads complain about noise."
182,1064,"Jul 19 2007 	Brilliant find!	My boyfriend and I stayed in this PTI on a Thurs/Fri evening while in London to see a gig in Camden. I chose this hotel for it's location, as it is literally across the road from the train/tube station, which makes it easy to get about. (As a footnote - I was tipped by a regular traveller to get an Oyster card which works as a pay as you go travel pass - it is scanned at the tube barriers when you start and end your journey and calculates the cost to deduct from your account - highly recommend you pick up a leaflet when you are at any station - cheaper way to travel!) The reception to the hotel is immaculate and inside there is both a Costa Coffee and the hotel bar/restaurant. Check-in was smooth and friendly and we were given a room on 2nd floor overlooking a courtyard, which was very quiet. The room was again immaculate and the bed was king size which was lovely and comfy. Much needed air con in the room! Bathroom - power shower! We ate in the restaurant for dinner - they do a great 2 courses for a tenner deal and the food was plentiful and typical of pub-grub fayre in clean and 'trendy' surroundings, menu extremely reasonably priced as is 12 for a bottle of Linndeman's red wine (trust me - I know my wine prices!!) We sat on a small terrace attached to the bar in the sunshine. There wasn't a thing I could complain about during my two night stay and would honestly stay here again the next time I visit London without a doubt. The PTI surpasses the old saying you get what you pay for, here you get a bit more than that on top. Consider London prices - this is excellent value for money."
183,1064,"Jul 18 2007 	Glad we stayed.	Stayed for 8 days at the end of June for our first family visit to London. We really enjoyed our trip even though the weather wasn't very nice and some things, especially the costant barrage of annoucements and warnings on the tube and the buses we could do without.I was a little apprehensive about the location before arriving, in terms of safety, but the hotel is very near the underground station and there are so many people going thru the area or working that there's no need to worry.What we liked about PTI: convenient public transport, clean hotel, quiet, large bedrooms, excellent beds, friendly staff, good breakfast, teenage sons ate free, restaurant quite good, no prepayment, could cancel the booking up to the day of arrival withouta cancellation fee, pretty good price.What we would like different: better light for reading in bed and after 2-3 days breakfast started getting monotonous as the exact samethings are served every day. All in all, though, I would recommend both the hotel and London to friends."
184,1064,"Jun 30 2007 	Pretty decent stay :)	Just got done with my 1 week stay at the Premier Travel Inn. This hotel was pretty decent. The good things include: the location- it's so close to the underground and train station @ king's cross, about a 2 minute walk; a clean room, an amazing bed!! ample space, nice large desk area, and a good shower head; also a downstairs restaurant and coffee shop.Some not so good things: VERY noisy (construction, loud neighbours (bars nearby); no laundry service, you have to pay quite a bit to use the wireless internet, no extra amenities like gym, room service, mini-bar, etc. But I guess that would only bother you if you were staying a while.For a couple days this place is great. Pretty cheap to stay right in all the action of things.But I gotta say, the best part was the bed!!"
185,1064,"Jun 27 2007 	Great	Been there for two nights on a weekend getaway. Its great value for money by London standards. Easily the best choice I made in town (left aside the expensive Soho Hotel), and Ive been there a lot.Its located right across Kings Cross Station, so its the perfect base to get everywhere in town by tube. The room was very new, spotless and surprisingly big. Despite facing the busy street the room was very quit at night. Cant comment on breakfast since I didnt had one. Instead I enjoyed a quick coffee at Costa Coffee which is basically located inside the lobby. Other breakfast options within 200m are Starbucks, McDonalds and all the opportunities insidethe station. Next to the hotel (in the side street) there is a Tesco supermarket to keep you well stocked. Opposite the Tesco is a very nice basic pub to enjoy a pint now and then. On my next London-Trip I will check this hotel first."
186,1064,"Jun 5 2007 	Great Base	Enjoyed our stay here (2 adults, 1 12 year old). Rooms are relatively large by London standards and spotlessly clean. Staff extremely pleasant and helpful. A very good base to stay and convenient for public transport links. Very nice breakfast. We left our luggage after check out and collected it just before our Kings Cross departure back home. Would definitely recommend this as a base and look forward to a return stay."
187,1064,"May 29 2007 	Excellent Value - Family Friendly	Second time we have stayed here for a short break with our kids. Staff very helpful and attentive. The rooms are well maintained in this relatively new hotel and are very clean. Kids under 16 eat free with paying adults at the buffet style breakfast. 50 yards from Kings Cross railway station. The area around the hotel is the only aspect that lets it down, otherwise it is excellent value."
188,1064,"May 20 2007 	Great weekend break	This is the first time at this hotel, normally we have stayed at the Holiday Inn, Bloomsbury. In comparison the travel lodge far exceeded our expectations. The staff are extremely friendly, in reception and in particular in the restaurant. We took breakfast there both mornings and the service and food were excellent.The room was spotlessly clean, I'm very fussy, the double bed was huge, very comfortable and the pillows lovely and soft. Compared to the Holiday Inn, the bedroom was huge as was the bathroom, with an excellent power shower, and at a much cheaper rate.I would highly reccommend this hotel, I could have stayed longer but it was back to work Monday morning. Shame!"
189,1064,"May 15 2007 	great hotel	I have just returned from a weekend in London with my husband where we stayed at the kings cross premier travel inn.The hotel was spotlessly clean and staff were very friendly. The room was spacious, comfortable and very clean. The only niggle is that it was cold and the air conditioning seemed to be stuck on 'freezing'.The breakfast was great, for about 7.50 you could have all you could eat - bacon, sausages, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, eggs, toast etc. we also had dinner there one day - no complaints there either.It is right next to Kings Cross station, literally 2 minutes walk. At kings cross, there are a number of underground lines so you don't really need to change at any station, you can get straight there and back. However, at weekends, some lines are closed so you DO need to change lines but it's really easy.The area around kings cross isn't great - there were lots of drunks and intimidating looking youths. I did feel uncomfortable at times, but like I said the hotel is right next to the station so you're safe in the hotel very quickly. I wouldn't advise you to eat in the local area - stay in the centre of london or eat in the hotel.That said, we would go back to this hotel. We loved london!"
190,1064,"May 15 2007 	Great hotel great location	I stayed at Premier Travel Inn King's Cross for 3 nights. The hotel was very clean and comfortable, the staff were really friendly and helpful. The hotel is safe and at the great location. The tube and buses are just a minute away. There are also Starbucks, McDonald's, Pret a manger, KFC etc just around the corner. Costa coffee is practically in the hotel. The hotel is also very quiet and good night sleep is guaranteed. Beds are very cosy and huge. This hotel is great for everyone who is in London for business or pleasure. I would definitely stay there again."
191,1064,"May 13 2007 	Great Weekend Break	Stayed here for weekend break - booked 2 rooms for myself, wife, 15 yr old daughter and sister in law. Didn't bother with the breakfats but the hotel was well situated and gave us easy access to all of London's amenities with Kings Cross Tube just 2 minutes away.Room were good size, good double beds and kids bed ands all for @350 for two rooms for 2 nightsWe'll be backKevin - West yorks"
192,1064,"May 9 2007 	Excellent base - we will be back!	Stayed here for a 4 night break in London. We have used Travel Inns before so knew roughly what to expect but had never stayed in one so large and so centrally located.From the moment we arrived we were made welcome. Staff at reception were pleasant and efficient and very helpful. Throughout our stay they greeted us when we passed and asked if everything was ok. It certainly was. The room was large and very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept well! The bathroom was spotless and the shower hot and powerful over a nice, deep bath. We ate breakfast every morning in the restaurant, opting for the buffet at 7.50 for as much as you liked. We also had dinner there on two of our night and can thoroughly recommend the food, wine and service.The location of the hotel is just across the road from the side entrance to the main King's Cross station and the entrance to the Underground system is just round the corner from where we accessed all areas. Would recommend this to anyone - young or old. As we stayed over the May bank holiday weekend, there were lots of families with children of all ages there. All were catered for and there wasn't a grumble from anyone.Excellent price too - just perfect for a London base either for business or pleasure.We will be back!"
193,1064,"May 9 2007 	Excellent!	I stayed at this hotel 1st May for 3 nights and to be honest was a little wary after reading some of the reviews. All I can say is that for anyone in the same position - DONT WORRY. The hotel staff were very friendly and its a refreshing change to have hotel staff smile at you when you speak to them, nothing was too much trouble for them. The room was very clean and value for money - its one of the few places I've stayed in London where the bathroom was spotless. The standards here would easily put some of the 4* hotels around london to shame.If you are travelling for business or a short stay then this hotel will not dissapoint. I will certainly be using it again and can happily say its saved me a huge headache of trying to find somewhere cheap and suitable in central london!"
194,1064,"May 8 2007 	Great Find - Definitely Stay Here Again!!!	I stayed here with my husband, mother &amp; father, brother &amp; partner for two nights and if we visit London again, well definitely stay here.Firstly on arrival at the station, we were over the moon to find the hotel was within a stones throw away, so convenient since we spent the weekend on and off the tube. The staff were only too happy to take our bags and keep them stored away as we were too early to check in. On check-in, we found our rooms to be spacious, clean, comfortable and more importantly for London hotels, very quiet!The restaurant was excellent and we ended up eating there on both evenings although we hadnt intended too. It was quite reasonably priced and we had no complaints whatsoever about the service and quality of the meals. The only thing I would say is be prepared to be asked about 10 times per meal if you are okay for drinks. I think the staff were just being friendly and trying to impress but it does get a bit annoying after a while! The drinks were quite pricey but what can you expect from a big city! There were tables and chairs on decking outside (quite rare for central London) with patio heaters so we were able to spend time outside enjoying a few drinks.The breakfast was fantastic value, you could eat as much as you liked for 7.50 and the choice was amazing.Again at check-out, the reception staff kept our bags stored away as our train wasnt due to depart until earlier in the day and had drinks, muffins and fruit to help yourself to on the way out.Overall, this is a central, comfortable, reasonably priced hotel with good food, facilities and excellent staff - STAY HERE!!!!"
195,1064,"Apr 28 2007 	Good night guaranteed	I've just stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while in London on a training course. I booked via the hotel website, which was easy and quick, and received text messages confirming my booking, and, on the day of my arrival, a message asking if I wanted to book a table in the restaurant that night.The location is great, just around the corner from King's Cross/St Pancras, so getting there and around the city is a breeze. The hotel is a well-designed, modern building - the entrance leads into a glass-ceilinged central atrium, which half of the rooms overlook (the rest overlook a patio to the rear). Check in (and out) was efficient and smooth, and the room was spotlessly clean with decent quality fittings. Facilities are basic (only shampoo/shower gel in the bathroom, no drawers just open shelves and hanging space), but what you do get is perfectly adequate for a short stay.The bed was a zip-locked king size, one half of which was a little too soft, but as I was alone, this wasn't a problem. There was an air-con unit which was a little rattly, but as I didn't need to leave it on all night, this wasn't a problem either. The TV had about 7 or 8 channels plus radio. The room was extremely quiet, I hardly heard any noise from other rooms or the corridor.The restaurant serves reasonably-priced food in a pleasant, contemporary setting. The waiting staff were really helpful, friendly and efficient, and given that the restaurant gets quite busy (especially with lone diners like myself) everything ran like clockwork. Breakfast is a similarly efficient affair, served buffet-style with a wide selection to choose from.The Premier Travel Inn offers a 'good night guarantee', so if you don't have a good night, you can get your money back. I can't imagine that they have to do this very often though! I would definitely stay here again if in London on business."
196,1064,"Apr 18 2007 	loved this hotel	I stayed in this hotel at king's cross and having read some of the negative reviews about this area, I wondered what we were in for ,but I can tell anyone reading this and unsure whether to book I say GO AHEAD! The staff were really friendly and the hotel is extremely clean and well laid out. The breakfast at 7.50 was excellent value as you can eat as much or as little as you like, we also were really pleased as they told us we could have 1 child free with a paying adult which was a great saving. The area around this hotel is a little run down, but we were not sightseeing at Kings x ! The underground is right on the doorstep and will take you to any part of London you want, although it was a little tricky the first day, by the second we were more familiar with what to do."
197,1064,"Apr 14 2007 	This is really a PREMIER HOTEL	My Wife and 2 children stayed at the Premier Inn Kings Cross for 10 days including the easter weekend. The hotel is very good all round good rooms for families, good food, good beer, and great staff. Stay here you will not be disappointed with the establishments facilities etc. When I return to London this will be the hotel of my choice to stay at. Taxi from Heathrow about 55 pounds well thats London expensive place to live.At Easter time the hotel even had live &quot;Easter Rabbits&quot; for the children to play with and a great supply of free easter eggs etc for the kids. The tube is really just across the road Kings Cross station and bus stop adjacent to front door. A few drunks etc frequent the surrounding streets. A tesco supermarket and macdonalds etc nearby. A good hotel with good management."
198,1064,"Apr 10 2007 	Would be hard to beat!	We stayed at this hotel during the Easter weekend. It was fabulous.To begin with, the hotel is ideally located, about 5 minutes walk from Kings Cross Underground Station. When you approach the top of York Way (the road which the hotel is located on), you can see the Premier Inn flags on the right hand side of the street. It is down a street, and would probably score low on views, however, once you enter the hotel, the welcoming atmosphere created by the staff is one of willingness and professionalism. Every member of staff we saw smiled, nothing was too much trouble for anyone. Upon check in our son was given a &quot;Kids Pack&quot; and drink and there was also a brilliant Easter Egg competition taking place. Check in was swift and professional. Our room was located on the ground floor. The room was extremely spacious, very clean and represented a 4* hotel instead of a 3* hotel. The only negative thing is that our room (and I understand all the ground floor rooms) have no window as such, instead they have frosted glass blocks, which allow the light in, but do block any view. The bathroom was immaculate (all the sealant was pure white with no mould! and the show curtain showed no trace of mould either). Our evening meal was in &quot;Barest&quot; - again, the staff were excellent - nothing was too much trouble. There was another &quot;Kids pack&quot; for our son and the choice on the menu was excellent. The food was of an exceptional standard and we all felt very satisfied after our meal.Breakfast again was fantastic. There was a good selection of hot food (including vegetarain sausages), the best selectionof cereal I have ever seen, even make your own Granola! There was even Hot Cross Buns (these were kept in a warmer together with the croissants and were absolutely delicious).All in all, excellent value for money and a very well managed hotel where the staff are obviously very happy to work at which reflected in their attitude."
199,1064,"Apr 8 2007 	Highly recommended	My friend and I had an excellent experience this week at the Premier Travel Inn at Kings Cross. Very good value for money in expensive London. Comfortable, scrupulously clean, good-sized and quiet room overlooking the inner courtyard. Prompt attention at reception when we arrived. Staff in breakfast room efficient and friendly despite the large number of guests. Very wide choice of food. We were always asked if we had everything we wanted and used dishes were removed almost too quickly ! Only minor complaint - breakfast at 7.50 is rather pricey if you don't want a big meal; the cheaper &quot;continental&quot; option promised on the website was not in fact on offer. Recommend the hotel highly nevertheless and will return next time I have to stay in London. Colin in Brussels, Belgium."
200,1064,"Mar 28 2007 	Excellent Experience !	I travel a lot with work and have stayed in many hotel chains but never a premier travel inn and if im honest I always thought of it as a basic hotel chain. I was completely taken aback with the quality and standard of this hotel considering the price!! In all honesty I was forced to book into this hotel for a mid week trip to London because everywhere appeared to be full and I can honestly say after this trip I will always stay at this particular hotel when visiting London.The room was incredibly spacious, the bed was enormous and so comfortable. The check out was 12pm which was incredibly convenient and the breakfast was fantastic for only 7.50 considering I usually pay around 14 in a Novotel and it was exactly the same if not better! The location could not have been better, you literally fall out of the hotel into Kings Cross station. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly and they offer a good night guarantee which they informed me means that if at any time through the night you are not happy with your room they will move you. The only downfall is the parking as there is an NCP but dont be fooled by a 'short walk' it is quite far considering the busy roads you have to cross. Although this did not ruin my stay and I will definetly be staying again.GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY!! WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!! AND WILL DEFINETLY STAY THERE AGAIN."
201,1064,"Mar 26 2007	Fantasic Location Great Hotel at a very good price	We stayed at the Kings Cross Travel Inn on Friday night. When we arrived we were greeted by pleasant staff. Our room was a good size and clean. It was on the 3rd floor overlooing the internal courtyard and was very quiet.The beds were comfortable and the room had tv, tea &amp; coffee making facilities, hairdryer. There were also irons and ironing boards available.The breakfast was excellent and was all you can eat, cereals, fruit, porridge, muffins &amp; croissants and a full cooked english breakfast.All in all a very pleasant experience and would definitely stay there again."
202,1064,"Mar 25 2007 	Great find around the corner from Kings Cross	We only stayed one night in this hotel (in May of 2006), as it was at the end of our trip. However, we were very impressed with it, and almost wished we had stayed in it before! The bed was huge, and very comfortable. The bathroom, again, was large and spacious. The room was decorated in nice blues and dark hardwood, which was a nice change from the usual stark white rooms you find in these cheaper hotels. The room itself was also very large, and quiet. The restaurant, too, was also really good. Service was great. It was nice being so close to King's Cross, which made for a quick getaway to Heathrow; and the Tube lines are perfect for quickly getting in to and out of the core of London. The price is a little more than other Premier Travel Inns in the city, but it is worth the extra bit if you want a larger room and the convenience of being steps away from King's Cross. The only downside would be the area itself; it is known for being seedy. However, you are only a couple minutes walk from King's Cross, so it should not be a problem, or too much of a cause for concern. There is a McDonalds close by, also, if you do not wish to pay for the hotel breakfast (which is a bit expensive if you are exchanging with the dollar). Overall, a really great find in the middle of the city; perfect for travellers who do not want to spend a bundle on hotels in London, but still want the comfort of a more expensive hotel."
203,1064,"Mar 20 2007	Fabulous location great room and good value for money!	We were very impressed with this Travel Inn. The location isnt the prettiest but it is absolutely perfect if you are looking for a base to explore London. Kings Cross train and tube station are a couple of minutes walk away. The tube network is fabulous in London so this gives you access to everywhere that you could possibly want to go.The rooms in the Travel Inn were large (something of a rarity in London), well furnished and decorated, and spotless. The bed was very comfortable. Since I was travelling with my Mum, we wanted two beds. However, we were initially assigned a room with one bed. We were changed to a room with two beds but the single bed was huge (probably queen size) and looked very comfortable. We werent planning to have breakfast at the Travel Inn because it was an extra 7.50 each (I think thats right, if not, its around that figure) so we planned to find a caf or Starbucks nearby. However, due to the mix-up in rooms and a problem with checking-in which took them 30mins to sort out (not the best when you arrive at midnight after spending 6 hours travelling) we asked if breakfast would be included free of charge as a courtesy gesture. We were told that that would be no problem. We werent expecting much from the breakfast but we were pleasantly surprised. There was lots of variety  cooked breakfast, cereal, fruit, yogurt, toast, porridge, tea, and coffee. The overall cost (82 per night excluding breakfast) was great value for money considering the quality of the room and the location. Ive stayed in quite a few hotels in London and felt this was better value that a lot of hotels Ive stayed in. All in all we were very impressed with the Kings Cross Premier Travel Inn  it was a very comfortable, good value for money and pleasant stay. I wouldnt hesitate to go back there."
204,1064,"Mar 18 2007 	Wonderfull location	wonderfull location, you got access to Kings cross station which you reach any part of london easly, the hotel is clean and quite and bigger than any hotel in the area, you can get lower price in the area but not as good as this hotel."
205,1064,"Mar 13 2007	Fantastic!!!!	The perfect base for my weekend in london, room was far bigger than i'd expected having read reviews of other london hotels having tiny rooms. Had t.v., bath, shower, tea/coffee facilities, everything one could possibly need in a hotel room. Hotel had lovely bar and restaurant, we only had breakfast there though...all you can eat buffet...and it really is all you can eat!!!!Literally 1 minute walk to kings cross station, friendly helpful staff, would recommend this hotel to anyone"
206,1064,"Feb 20 2007 	Handy Location	Stayed at this Budget Hotel for 3 nights 13th-16th Feb. Booked a triple room, one adult with two teenagers. Room size was ok, main bed was big as are all the double beds in Premier Travel Inns, the third bed was very small, a 5' 6&quot; teenager couldnt sleep in it though! Room was ok, bit dimly lit, view was nothing to speak of, windows could have done with a god clean they were very very dirty on the outisde.Heating didnt work in the room, portable heater was supplied but wasnt really adequate, it was February after all!!Bathroom had everything you needed but was also cold and smelt of smoke quite strongly.Best bit was the breakfast, value for money for 7.50 all you could eat hot buffett. Tried evening meals which were also quite good and seemed overall better value for money than the 3 night stay.I would have expected better lighting and a warmer room as a standard so it didnt live up to my expectations.Handy for being central for tube lines for sight -seeing as so close to Kings Cross.I doubt I would stay here again ."
207,1064,"Feb 16 2007 	Central but Loud 	I stayed here a couple of years ago and managed to get a very good deal through the hotels website. I think I paid 47.00 for a double room, no breakfast.The Hotel was barely 5 minutes walk from Kings Cross main station and was very easy to find. It didn't look like your average Premier Travel Inn from the outside as I think it was in an old listed building but once inside and in our room it met our expectations.Room was modern, of a good size and bathroom was good with the power shower. BUT... we were in a room overlooking a railway platform. I think it was St Pancras but I'm not sure as St Pancras is further away than Kings Cross main station. We didn't get back till late but the tanoy was still blaring out train information and we were woken by the trains and tanoy about 5am.Needles to say I couldn't wait to get back home for some sleep!"
208,1064,"Feb 7 2007 	Excellent service	Good location being so close to Kings Cross station &amp; only a short distance from Euston. Staff are very friendly &amp; helpful, the hotel is modern &amp; clean &amp; the rooms are large with king size beds. Don't be put off that it is a Premier Travel Inn the standard &amp; facilities are excellent."
209,1064,"Jan 23 2007	Maybe the Best Choice in London!	The Premier Travel Inn London - King's Cross may be one of the best kept secrets in central London. The rooms are cheap and clean and the location can't be beat for the price.The hotel was recently renovated, and the updates are a welcome change in London. The lobby is a modern, bright, 5-story atrium with plenty of room to sit and chat or have a drink. There is a restaurant/pub in the first floor across from reception. The rooms are quite large; nearly the size of an American hotel room. The beds were large, the linens were clean, and the bathrooms had been updated, too.The location of this Premier Travel Inn can't be beat. It is a two minute walk to King's Cross - St. Pancras station in London; a major transport hub. Six Underground lines meet at King's Cross, so it is possible to get anywhere in central London very quickly. There are plenty of take-away restaurants and casual eateries in the area, and there's even a Tesco supermarket down the street if you want to buy your own groceries.The Premier Travel Inn may be a chain in the UK, but it's a clean, reliable one. It is closely comparable to a Hampton Inn in the US, but with more modern finishes. I spent 75 pounds on a room during the weekend, which is a steal in London. For the price, the Premier Travel Inn - King's Cross is a far better deal than any of those five star places on Park Lane."
210,1064,"Jan 1 2007 	Good Location Good Value Clean	We stayed for 6 nights, leaving on Christmas day. The hotel staff was very friendly, the room always clean and the beds comfortable. We found the rooms very quiet but the hotel may not have been as busy as some other times. The onsite restaurant and bar were quite good. The location, right next to the King's Cross/St Pancras Tube station is fabulous since many different tube lines pass through Kings Cross. There are some good restaurants, cafes and food stores within a minute or two of the hotel including, Starbucks, Pret a Manger, McDonalds, two excellent Indian restuarants and a nice looking Italian restaurant (we did not try the Italian place), and one large grocery store and 3 smaller ones. Inside the train station is a Marks and Spencer food store that is excellent and cornish pasty place."
211,1064,Jan 1 2007	Value for money and location!	Didnt know what to expect with this one but it turns out that being beside Kings Cross is a true gem! An its truely value for money as well as being very comfortable. Still feels new inside - fabulous entrance lobby with cafe bar off - evening meal was a little slow but they apologised profusely for being short staffed and the bar was very convenient too for a quickie. Only complaint was the lifts - very slow - suggest if your above floor three try the healthy option and walk. Great value breakfast - plenty of it... eat as much as you can and buffet style which is a great start to a london holiday every day! Rooms are small and there isnt much room to leave things about but what there is is good and solid - good bathroom and shower and tea/coffee making - beds changed and made up daily. Recommended for all those who got out for a days sightseeing and then only back for a quick shower for out again ! Enjoy...
212,1064,"Dec 18 2006 	Great location. REasonable price.	I booked this hotel as a surprise weekend away for myself &amp; my boyfriend.We're both students so I was on a tight budget. At 75 per night this was one of the cheapest hotels in London that seemed to tick all of the boxes (no, accomodation really isn't cheap in London!)The main reason I chose this hotel was because of its central location. It's literally a 90 second walk to Kings Cross station &amp; from there you can access most major attractions in a matter of minutes.As well as this, it has its own bar (open till 1am) &amp; restaurant. There is no room service, but buffet breakfast is 7.50...we slept in both mornings so didn't try this!We didn't eat in the main restaurant but did try the bar food for lunch.The food was fine but the waitress left alot to be desired- she tried to make me pay extra for something that was listed on the menu &amp; her limited English led to a great deal of confusion.As far as the rooms go, they were standard hotel rooms. The hotel has a very modern, clean feel about it. All of the rooms are decorated in blue &amp; white. The bed was bigger than an average double bed. My only negative comment would be that Kings Cross, where the hotel is situated, is a run down, unsafe area. Locals who we got talking to, told us to be very careful there at night &amp; to get a taxi straight to our door.Also, contrary to what previous reviews say, there are no restaurants of note in the area other than MacDonalds type chains. We travelled to Picadilly Circus to eat.But you would probably have to pay more to stay in a nicer area.Overall. Lived up to my expectations.&amp; I suppose the most important question is whether I would stay there again.The answer is a resounding YES!"
213,1064,"Nov 24 2006 	Very Good!	The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. We liked staying there but did have a problem with the shower flooding the bathroom floor everytime we used it. We had to put towels down to soak up the water. Also please note they do not have washcloths only large towels and hand towels. You may want to take washcloths with you if you stay there. They do not have bar soap either. Only foam soap containers on the bathroom walls. It should also be noted that they have free coffee and juices in the dining area every morning but you have to furnish your own drinking container. We did not find this out until two days before we left as it is not advertised. They do have coffee and a coffee maker in your room too. Overall, we would stay there again and the price was good."
214,1064,"Nov 13 2006	DB Tours	Just arrived home after a thoroughly enjoyable weekend in London taking in Lord Mayors show, Football and Remembrance Day at the Cenotaph. Stayed at Travel Inn on the basis of previous reviews and my own personal experience of staying in Travel Inns in other parts of London. Kings Cross is the best I have stayed in. Rooms clean with change of linen each day, Staff extremely helpful, food excellent value and a well stocked bar. Excellent value at #75 per room. Would definitely stay here again."
215,1064,"Nov 4 2006 	Excellent value	I booked this hotel after reading the trip advisor reviews and I was not disappointed!I stayed with my husband and 2 children for 2 nights during half term and we had a thoroughly enjoyable time. It is incredibly central for sight seeing but once you're inside the hotel it is easy to forget that you are only a 2 minute walk from Kings Cross. Our room was clean, quiet and had an enormous double bed plus 2 singles.We paid extra for breakfast in the hotel and there was a good selection of food, always fresh and lots of it!We ate in the restaurant on one evening and had super service. The food was good and the surroundings very pleasant. The only reasons I haven't given this hotel an excellent rating are:1) We arrived 25 mins early and were not allowed to check in - was our room really not ready by then?2) The room has very limited sky tv and no sky sports channels.We will definitely use this hotel/hotel chain again and would recommend it to our friends and family."
216,1064,"Oct 15 2006 	a heaven after staying in hell	London is always my priority stop in any European tour, and I know how expensive London hotels are. While paying only about 50 pounds in 2003, I got more than I expected. Since then, I have tried hotels nearby like Ibis, Euston, Tavistock, Royal National, and I still prefer this one in areas of modernity, international standard amenities in room, design and a diversity of colour in the interior and courteous staff. At least, I didn't need to end an enquiry of the possibility of helping me to book a show ticket with a quarrel on duty and service with a front desk staff in another hotel, which was my first outburst of fury in words in public. I write this late report only because I am sad to read a 'getting worse' report in this review column. My recent stays in some London hotels prompts me to recall the good memories of staying in P.Travel Inn: trouble-free/ no broken bulbs/ no floor vomits/ no loose door lock/ no go-down TV. After reading many horrible and incredible reports about poor qualities of London hotels, I come to a conclusion that either I have to pay over 150 pounds for one nite, or carrying a mobile camp bed and staying in stations. I must come back to P.Travel Inn next time in London. Actually I failed to get a room and the price quote of this inn on internet in late September and early October, the period of my London coming back tour. Best value for money in London!!"
217,1064,"Oct 11 2006 	Excellen Hotel in London!	After reading great reviews on trip advisor, we did not hesitate to book here and everybody was right! The Hotel was easy to find only 1-2 min walk from King's Cross station, and you can get anywhere from this station so it is ideal to see london. The foyer was well decorated, the reception helpful and nice. We took a double room and it was VERY large with new furniture and a king size bed. The bathroom likewise was huge, new and well equiped. Only thing needed was a mini bar, but if thats all to complain about! The restaurant was also very good, we had lunch there one day and the meals were very tasty. Breakfast was very good value at 7 pounds and surprisingly had a great selection of good food. We are staying there again in november and recommend this to everybody staying in london. It is the best priced hotel and certainly the best quality we have stayed in in Europe."
218,1064,"Sep 4 2006	Excellent value for the price great location	I found this hotel on an Internet hotel website and, after much deliberation, decided to book it based on the high ratings that I'd seen reviewers give it. My husband and I went to London for a long weekend and we desired an affordable, clean room with a comfortable bed, great location with good access to the tube and a good English breakfast. This hotel was excellent on all these points. As others have said in previous reviews, the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was cleaned &amp; sheets changed every day. I don't know what the complaints about the breakfast were about, since we had nothing but delicious and plentiful food each morning and smiling service from the staff.Location-wise, even though I'd had my doubts about staying in Kings Cross, it turned out to be a great location. Not only was the tube station literally a 2-minute walk from the hotel, but so many different lines and the train station are located at Kings Cross. It was great to come directly from Heathrow via the tube and be able to walk to the hotel even with our luggage. And the price! Since we stayed at the weekend, we paid 75 pounds for the double room per night (excl. breakfast). With such a good location, easy access, cleanliness and great bed, we found this to be very good value for London. I definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again if we go to London once more in the future."
219,1064,"Aug 29 2006	Reasonable for budget accommodation	A new hotel, well-located for King's Cross station. Standard budget fare inside. Horrible smell of cigarrette smoke in corridors, but the room was clean and the bed comfortable. A little noisy, despite the double-glazing.Its problem is that rates keep creeping up. At 85 per night, this is getting to be close to the price that the decent hotels nearby charge when they're on special offer (e.g. Novotel London Euston, just along the road). It's hardly a &quot;budget&quot; price for a very basic experience."

1,1068,"Suited My needs	I stayed at this hotel for four nights as it was close to friends. Everything about the hotel was quite good. Rooms are comfortable but have no fridge. However, the airconditioning is loud and annoying. Breakfast was good but no hot buffet. Hot meals must be ordered a la carte."
2,1068,"Nov 23 2009 	Overall good value and would recommend	We booked the hotel as we had left it late to find anywhere and this seemed to represent the best value. Good points:- The room was nice and spacious- Shower was great, powerful and always lots of water- Service overall was great- It was only a 5 minute walk from the Colliers Wood underground which is on the Northern Line (direct from Euston)- It was very clean - It's opposite a supermarket if you needed anything/had forgotten anythingBad points:- The room was far too hot all the time and as the hotel is on a busy road traffic noise makes it impossible to sleep with the windows open- The bed was not comfortable, it was awful. I have slept in some pretty awful beds and this was about a 4/10 for comfort- It was a bit far out from central London but having said that there were a couple of nice pubs/bars and restaurants nearbyI'd give it a 3.5 out of 5, it's better than 3, not as good as four!"
3,1068,"Sep 20 2009 	Fabulous for a budget hotel	Well I have to admit that I was very pleasantly surprised. Though my expectations of a budget chain hotel weren't high at all I have to admit. I'm very impressed with their &quot;perfect night's sleep&quot; policy - in other words, if you don't have a quiet and comfortable night's sleep, you'll get a refund. It doesn't get better than that!Bed is really nice and comfy with nice bedding. I guess the only slight downside is the air system which can be a bit loud. I've actually stayed at this hotel twice now in the past couple of months and will happily recommend."
4,1068,"Jun 3 2009 	The Premier Inn made our stay in London very special.	My husband and I spent 5 nights in the Premier Inn South Wimbledon and we could not praise the place enough. We were greated by friendly staff who made us feel very welcome. Our room was spotlessly clean, the only problem was the heat, it was up to 30 degrees centigrade while we were there, there was air conditioning but it was rather loud when turned on, but it did not really bother us, and with the window open it was quiet comfortable.The hotel is only 5 minutes walk from the Underground, there are shops on both sides of the road, there are lovely restaurants at the rear of the hotel and a couple of lovely pubs, not that you would need to go to the pub as there is a nice bar in the hotel.The breakfast is very good and you can eat as much as you like.I had read in a previous review that it could be noisy from outside we did not find this, and we felt very safe while we were staying there"
5,1068,"Sep 23 2008 	Good service reasonable hotel.	We stayed here for two nights so we could see the Davis Cup tennis at the nearby All England Club. The location for that was OK, although I would try for something in Southfields if I went again. The hotel is easy to get to on the tube, you can get the Northern Line straight from Euston, it takes around 40 minutes, and the hotel itself is about five minutes walk from the tube station.The hotel is clean and decent and the staff were exceptionally helpful and pleasant. We didn't eat there, as another reviewer mentioned, the hotel is very near to a retail park with Starbucks, Marks and Spencers, Sainsburys etc all a couple of minutes away. The room was pleasant, clean and reasonably sized, although facilities are fairly basic. The main disadvantage is that like most hotels it was suffocatingly hot. Opening the window let in the constant roar of traffic from the extremely busy major road just outside, and while there was air con, it was incredibly noisy, so we didn't sleep as well as we would have hoped. Overall though, it's not a bad hotel at all for the money, 148 for two nights in London."
6,1068,Aug 29 2008 	Ok for a london hotel	The room was amazingly big with coffee and tea making machine. Did not go for breakfast as there was supermarkets &amp; starbucks within walking distance of the hotel.The air-conditioning could make you go deaf. The only thing that I really did not like was the fact that there were quite a few big electricity poles near the hotel.
7,1068,"Aug 23 2008 	most recommendable	I stayed in the hotel for 7 nights with my wife and two daughters. The hotel was very comfortable: the rooms were quite big and well furnished (air conditioning, LCD TV, etc.), breakfasts were excellent, service was nice and polite. In a perimeter of about 200 m there are restaurants (Pizza Hut, KFC) and a huge mall (food, clothing, etc.). The only disadvange was the distance form London center (about 20-30 minutes by tube). But generally the hotel is most recommendable and I will definately stay here in my next visit to London.Tuvia.ISRAEL"
8,1068,Aug 12 2008 	Fantastic value	We booked this hotel because of it's close proximity to Hampton court and short tube ride away to the centre of London. At just 68.00 per night I was expecting something really shabby and so was very pleased with the standard of accommodation and service. The staff at reception were friendly and helpful and our room was immaculate. The tube is just a few minutes walk away and it's much easier to drive to wimbeldon than the centre of London making this an ideal place to stay if you're sight seeing. This hotel is excellent value for money and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone making a trip into london.
9,1068,Jul 25 2008 	Excellent	even though this hotel is about 20 min on tube into London it is great value for money. very clean hotel and staff very friendly and attentive. lovely breakfast. It has a retail shopping park next to it and a great family pub searving 2 for 1 meals. a 5 min walk to the tube station.
10,1068,"Apr 10 2008 	Lovely hotel	Stayed for one night on a business trip check in was straight forward,nice friendly staff.Room was a very high standard, spacious &amp; spotlessly clean.The restaurant staff was both friendly &amp; helpful although the chef tried to pass a apple pie off as a crumble.Breakfast was lovely &amp; again very friendly staff.Over all a very good stay."
11,1068,"Jan 15 2008 	New develpoment and excellent hotel	If you want to stay in a brand new hotel in London, then this is the one for you! This hotel was only built in 2005, and it shows. Everything is pristine, well designed, and looks smart. When we stayed, car parking was free (quite rare in London hotels), but it looks like the car park was shortly going to be come pay&amp;display, so better check before you go.The rooms are standard average size rooms, with a large double bed, desk, TV, kettle, etc. A small table, and the rooms have air con as well which is a rareity for British hotels. We really couldn't find any fault with the room, it was clean and had everything we needed for our 5 night stay.The restraunt in the hotel was top notch too. Prices were similar to restraunts of the same standard, so there was no 'in hotel premium' which is refreshing. We only ate there on the Sunday evening, and it was very quiet. The waitress was very friendly though, and the food was good, served hot and tasted lovely.The hotel is situated a fair way out of London, but the Colliers Wood Underground station is about a 5 or 10 minute walk away, which take around 30 minutes to get you to the centre of London. This was the main reason we chose the hotel, as we wanted convienience but without sky high central London prices, and the ability to park our car for free. There is also a large Sainsburys supermarket opposite the hotel, handy for snacks to bring back to the room, or to take with you as a packed lunch.Its probably not the ideal hotel for the business user as it is a 30 minute tube journey outside London centre, which will be a very busy tiresome journey during rush hour. For the tourist though I'd say its ideal. Wait until 9:30am to get the tube, and not only do the prices drop, but the trains are also quieter and more pleasant (the Northern Line is a fairly nice line as tube lines go). We then had our evening meal in restraunts in London, and travelled back to the hotel at around 7:30pm/8pm, where again it was less busy.We'll definately be staying there again if we are staying for a week, but for convienience we'd find a hotel closer to the city if we were only staying one night."
12,1068,"Oct 19 2007 	Above and beyond my expectations!	My husband and I stayed at the Premier Travel Inn in the suburb of Wimbledon in London. The building was very new and had a beautiful modern interior. It is located about a five minute walk from the Colliers Wood tube station on the Northern Line (don't take the South Wimbledon stop!). It usually took about 20 minutes to get into the heart of London for tourist areas from Colliers Wood. The staff were very friendly, the room very clean, and the building was nice and quiet. Our large room had a full bathroom in the room which was nice. The bed was super comfy, with large fluffy pillows and a down comforter. The room also had AC. The hotel offered a great breakfast for seven pounds fifty pence each. We had dinner in the hotel one night and it was our best meal in London! Try the sticky toffee pudding! There are several restaurants within a block and a large super market across the street. We were very impressed with what we got for our money (70 pounds per night) and would definately stay there again in the future!"
13,1068,"Oct 10 2007	Another One Well Overpriced London Hotels!!!	As almost ALL London hotels, well overpriced. Rooms are 74 and 69 GBP. Without breakfast? Brekfast is 8 GBP, but, but, terrible cold buffet, and asking for hot buffet, they said NO. You most order hot buffet, so that they can control how much sausages, mushrooms, you can eat!So that, I did not take breakfest. We took hotel because of WIMBELDON court, but it takes 2 buses, at leat 30 minutes to reach Wimbledon!! UNDERGROUND is around 5-7 minutes walk from hotel, but it takes very long to reach City Centre of London.In hotel you must paid everything. The best things in hotel are reception desk staff, air condition, Big Sainsbury behind!!The worst thing in PAST reviews are comments like '' it was clean, ... ''it must be clean for room, 110 EUR, without breakfast! [--]!! 2 weeks before, I stayed in excellent 4-stars hotel PALACE, Mestre-Venezia, paying 65 EURO with breakfast, during MOSTRA, Angleine jolie, etc."
14,1068,"Apr 15 2007	Loved it!	I traveled with 17 students on a high school trip and this hotel was EXCELLENT!! The rooms were clean, spacious, safe, and quiet. This is one of the best budget hotels I've stayed in in Europe. The tube stop was a short 5 minute walk and there was a great/huge Sainsbury's right across the street."
15,1068,"Feb 10 2007	Hope you like getting up early!	This hotel is exactly what you expect from a travel inn. The rooms were very nice, the bar was good and the restaurant had a great 2 for 1 offer.What I found extremely annoying was the car parking. The week before my stay started the combined publc and hotel car park had gone through some changes. The upshot was that you had to put a ticket on your car each day at 8:30 in the morning. Each morning you had to join a queue of residents in their pj's to buy a ticket. I stayed in a hotel to make the weekend more relaxing but being forced out of bed at 8:30 was a real annoyance. The only good side was that I was up for the 'all you can eat' breakfast whcich was good value.Check with this hotel about the car park situation before you stay if you dont like being forced out of bed!"
16,1068,Feb 2 2007 	Highly Recommended	We stayed here for a long weekend last October and were very pleasantly surprised. Welcoming staff and claen rooms. Certainly value for money. Very handy for Colliers Wood tube (although the Northern line seems to always involve changing to get into the centre!)Warm rooms with loads of space.Would definitely stay again.
1,1079,Oct 26 2009 	A very poor experience	My room was very very small and noisy from other guests. The shower was cold. The TV in the room could not be watched for lack of space There was no channel guide for the TV. I was at the hotel when the clocks were turned back from daylight saving time. The automated phone wake up system did not adjust and I was woken 1-hr early. Sunday breakfast not served until 8:00-am which is too late for many travelers.The only good thing was it's location - close to Paddington
2,1079,"Oct 10 2009 	great place to stay	Right down the road from Paddington Stn. Rooms are small, but you won't spend much time in it. Clean and hygienic; free internet. Only criticism is that the service at breakfast was really poor. the staff didn't seem to want u there and one woman (blonde, older) did not smile once the 5 days i was there. Not what u want when u are so far from home."
3,1079,"Sep 24 2009 	nice hotel in excellent location	We stayed at the Queensway last week for 2 nights. We moved there after staying at another nearby hotel that was unsatisfactory and had a very good experience. The room seemed quite newly redone and was very clean. It was small, but was laid out well and had everything that was necessary. Even though the hotel is not large and luxurious, youcan't beat the price for a nice, centralized hotel in a big city."
4,1079,"Aug 31 2009 	Very good position!	I stayed at the Queensway for 3 nights and i think that it was better than what I expected!The rooms were clean and quite spacious, the bathroom was very small but it was all that you needed! There were plenty of food for the continental breakfast: croissants / choice of cereals / boiled eggs / orange and apple juice / white and brown toasts / jams and some more... The position is wonderful! very near to Paddington underground and there are some pubs in the area so you can relax in the evening and have a short walk to come back to the hotel. I reccomend this hotel for all that what to visit London in few days... for a long stay maybe I'd choose something else..."
5,1079,"Aug 24 2009 	A nice clean and cheap hotel!	The hotel was clean and comfortable. It was located in a good area, cental and quiet too. It was only 2 minutes of paddington tude and 3 minutes of hyde park. There were a lot of good restaurants around this hotel. The breakfast was good and the food was fresh and tasty. However, only the two chinese girls of the personnell were friendly and smiley. The rest of the personnell was not so eager to help you and they could be more polite. The toilet and shower of our room was extremely small but that is common in 3 star hotels."
6,1079,"Jul 21 2009 	Disappointing	I booked this hotel after reading good reviews on TripAdvisor, as I usually do, but was somewhat let down on this occasion. We stayed in a room on the top floor (4th) which involves walking up a steep and narrow staircase as the lift only goes to the 3rd floor. That didn't bother us as we didn't like using the small and slow lift but might be challenging for some.It's good points were that it's only a 5 minute walk to Paddington Station/Underground and roughly a 1.5 mile walk to Harrods and the room itself was fairly clean.The negatives.. The room is small and the bathroom is TINY; to sit on the toilet you had to squeeze under the sink! The shower was poor and there is no bath. The walls must be pretty thin as somebody's TV kept me awake til 4am which was replaced by snoring immediately after. The staff were all pretty miserable (except the lady on check-out).Breakfast was included and we ventured down to the basement (not that we were told about this). We were offered tea/coffee and toast which we had but didn't know what to do after that so we left.The hotel was just about bareable for the one night that we stayed, and maybe the price of 89 a night was cheap for the area (at the time of booking), but I would never stay here again nor recommend it to anyone."
7,1079,"Jul 4 2009 	Clean great location but nothing else going for it	We arrived at the hotel late in the evening, and were 'greeted' (if you could call it that) by a rather grumpy someone at the reception desk, who looked like he'd rather not be there. There was no problem with check-in. We were asked to pay for the room up-front and were then directed to our room. The room itself was absolutely fine. It was quite small (as to be expected for a lower budget hotel in that part of London). The bedroom and bathroom looked newly refurbished and they were both immaculately clean. It was the hottest day of the year and the room felt like a sauna! The one window was already open when we arrived at the hotel, although it didn't let much air in. It was a ground floor window, looking out on to a tiny courtyard, which was dominated by a huge service pipe. Not a great view. The only other thing to see out of the window was the ground floor windows of two further rooms. When we left the room, we closed the window for security, only to discover it didn't lock. Mildly concerned about this lack of security, we went to put our valuables in the safetly deposit box, only to discover it was already locked, so we couldn't access it! Later, when we decided to attempt to relax (despite the heat) and watch TV, we discovered that the remote control was also missing!Sleep didn't come easy as the room was so hot. The bed was fine (although quite small for a double), but the pillows weren't great.Breakfast the next morning was equally as disappointing. As others have said, it consisted of cereal, cheese (warm), milk (warm), yoghurt (warm), orange and apple juice (you guessed it -- warm!), toast (thankfully freshly made), jam, butter, and hard boiled eggs. I'm not usually fussy about tea, but the stuff they gave me was the colour of a urky river and it tasted as bad as it looked). I didn't try the coffee, but my husband informs me it was just about OK. In the end I stuck with toast, butter and eggs, as they were the only things that were around the right temperature.On the plus side, the location is great. A short walk to Hyde Park, very close to the tube station, loads of food outlets nearby, and (for anyone who's interested) just a short walk from St Mary's Hospital. The room is very clean, and the shower is fine."
8,1079,"Jun 17 2009 	believe the reviews - it's good!	My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in May - originally booked with a different hotel but at short notice they closed down leaving us with only days spare to find somewhere within our budget. Always a gamble when you dont want to spend a fortune on accomodation but we were thrilled about the whole stay with them. The staff were friendly, allowed us in early to our room - which was really clean!!! Such a relief. The room was totally adequate, bathroom too. Bed really comfortable and clean. Breakfast was as good as we could expect - we knew it was continental only but I was pleasantly suprised to be offered hard boiled eggs or cheese or yogurt as well as the cereal/toast option. Really pleased with our choice and would stay there again."
9,1079,"Jun 6 2009 	A Nice Clean Hotel at a Very Good Location	I stayed at the Queensway Hotel two times (the first one on June 2008) and probably will stay there in the future also. The location is excellent for a London visitor: very near Paddington Stations (both the Rail one, which connects to Heathrow Airport and South England and the Underground one, which is served by four lines, giving easy access to all of central London) and at walking distance to Hyde Park and several other places of interest. Sussex Gardens, where the Hotel is located, is a very nice small Boulevard where most buildings have been converted to Hotels (of varying standards).As appears to be the case in all of London (or so I was told by everyone), the accommodations are very tiny - there is not much space left in the rooms for circulation or for luggage. Also, it would be better if the beds where larger (both the single and the double ones), but the mattresses and pillows are new and good. Bathrooms are also very tiny, but expertly designed so as to be functional. Both are also kept very clean.Each room offers a small LCD TV, coffee and tea maker as well as a hair dryer. Also, each room has an Ethernet point (cabled; better to bring your own cable, as the Hotel has a limited supply of them) with Internet access, but not Wi-Fi. The low point is the wooden stool that accompanies the desk (not a chair - and all rooms have this same kind): hard and very uncomfortable. Even with a pillow, it is damaging to our buttocks.As for the Hotel staff, my experience with them was very good: owners (it is a small hotel, sometimes the owners hang by), reception clerks and maids are all sympathetic and accomodating.All in all, I think it is a good value in London."
10,1079,"Jun 3 2009 	Great Location cheaper hotel	My wife and I stayed here for just 2 days while we were in London. The location is truly excellent being only a few minutes walk from Paddington station, which is the main one from Heathrow. We only had the breakfast once, but that wasn't too bad because the breakfast wasn't great. Just cereal, toast, yogurt, though they did also have cheese and hard-boiled eggs. The price was good but we checked in early so we didn't get the good room that I had booked, which was ok for me because we really wanted to take showers and a nap before going out. The view out of our room was the vent from the kitchen in the basement. The last problem I had was with the water in the bathroom, it was always close to scalding hot, even with it turned all the way to cold. Which isn't bad in the winter, but in the summer, I prefer cold showers. Another plus for them is that they have internet, but it's corded, not wireless."
11,1079,"Apr 23 2009 	Great Location	The Queensway is in a lovely part of London, close to Hyde Park and easy walk to Oxford Street. Close to tube and Paddington. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast included is basic but adequate. The room we had was quite small but that is usual for inner city London. Bathroom nice and clean."
12,1079,"Feb 4 2009 	Great Budget Hotel	I stayed at Queensway hotel for 5 nights (double room) based on the previous reviews; however, I was a bit suspicious about the quality of the room due to the reputation of most budget hotels in London. When i checked in all my suspicions were gone, we took a ground floor room and although the room was a bit small it had enough space to make you feel comfortable and it was spotles clean. The bathroom was very clean also and the shower worked perfectly. The room has a coffee maker as well as a satellite TV. The location of the hotel is very convenient close to Paddington tube &amp; train station and a number of late night buses serve this area which made our transportation to all the main areas of London quite easy. The only drawback of the hotel was its breakfast which apart from ending quite early (9:15am!!) it was very very basic."
13,1079,"Dec 27 2008 	Conveniently located	Positives:1) conveniently located within short walking distance to train station, tube station and bus stops.2) Clean facilities.3) Has a small safe in roomThe big negative is the very boring breakfast. Good for those on a diet."
14,1079,"Dec 4 2008 	Quiet and Clean	I stayed at this hotel based on the closest to Paddington Station. Over all it was quiet, clean and had a good cold breakfast choice. The bed was comfy and the bathroon was clean. As for the size, it is the typical London size room. The only drawback for some would be that the lift only goes to the 3rd floor but some rooms are on the 4th floor. Not a problem for me small lightweight bag."
15,1079,"Oct 25 2008 	Perfect locaton Clean Quiet	I had a perfect stay at the hotel that is located close to both Paddington station and Lancaster Gate tube-station and several bus-stops so you can really go allover London at no time. I stayed in room 401 situated at the top floor after climbing some very steep and narrow steps. The lift only goes to floor no 3. The room and bathroom was small but it's all you need for sleeping. It was very clean, seemed to be renovated recently and not any disturbing noices. The only thing that was slightly negative was the breakfast. That was very thin even for a continental one. Next time I go to London I will most definetly stay here again and I recommend it to my friends."
16,1079,"Oct 21 2008 	Good Cheap hotel	Good/cheap hotel in the budget area of London. About 300 meters from Paddington Station, the hotel is easy to get to by walking. I made it with two big suitcases all alone. The hotel staff was semi-friendly. First off, my room was on the 4th floor and the lift only goes to the 3rd. There were two people working at the desk and none of them offer to help me carry my two 20 kg bags up the stairs. If you are staying on the 4th floor - warning- the stairs up are extremely steep. Other than that, my room was really clean. The bathroom was tiny but hey this is London. I had a flat screen tv with cable tv and free Internet in my room. Few pubs and restaurants are right near the hotel. I would recommend staying here."
17,1079,"Oct 17 2008 	If you can get a good rate go for it!	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights to kick off our latest holiday. The hotel was clean, the rooms were large for London (room to put two suitcases on the floor without having to jump over them). The bathroom in our from was new, the it was small but that's pretty common to all hotels in London.The hotel is just a few minutes from Paddington station, so it's perfect if you fly in from Heathrow, it's very close to some great restaurants, and Hyde park."
18,1079,Sep 26 2008 	Lovely hotel shame about the breakfast	Queensway is a great hotel if you don't eat breakfast. The rooms were newly refurbished and modern and the showers were hot and the beds comfortable. But the breakfast was appaling as were the staff who shouted at us to sit down and we didn't dare to ask for more sloppy cold toast. We ended up eating at a lovely Italian 50m away - full english breakfast for 2.50 pounds. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from Paddington as well so ideal location. We would definetly use it again but without breakfast.
19,1079,"Sep 22 2008 	Great location with housekeeping issues.	Selling features for this hotel - down the street (literally a 3 minute walk) from Paddington tube station, located in a quiet area (on a block of hotels), has a lift, and is absolutely gorgeous from the outside. The room was standard sized, but the washroom was another story. While sitting on the toilet my face was almost in the sink and I could barely manipulate myself to get into the shower. Linens were not cleaned daily and new towels were not given, even when they were clearly dirty (we spilled curry all over one of the unmade beds and cleaned it with towels. When we arrived back to the hotel the soiled towels were hung neatly in the washroom). When we asked reception for new towels and a new sheet they seemed skeptical about our story, but gave up the goods - they genuinely seemed to have no idea their housekeeping staff wasn't properly doing their job. We were also told by reception that housekeeping was between 10am-2pm and if you did not want to leave your room early you could ask them to come back (we specifically asked because we had had a late night the evening before). When housekeeping arrived at 12pm we asked them to come back, but we were forcefully told if we wanted our room cleaned that day we have 5 minutes to depart.Aside from the housekeeping problems and small bathroom it was a pleasant stay. The location of this hotel alone makes it a worth while stay."
20,1079,"Sep 22 2008 	Good hotel for price and location	These rooms are fairly reasonable considering the price and location. The bathroom was quite small, but it was all that you needed. I would stay here again, but remember that it's in London so adjust your expectations accordingly. Also, the breakfast lady was very interesting (!) - make sure you get there early as she tends not to replace food once it runs out..."
21,1079,"Sep 15 2008 	big thumb up outstanding	I have stayed in quite a couple of London hotels but this one is far the best one and very good value for money.It's the cleanest and tidiest hotel I have ever been in at this price catagory. The drawback: although very tidy and friendly, the rooms are a bit too small. Especially when you are in the toilet which has a very well designed shower, you need to twist a little bit your body to sit down for your intimate business in order not to sqeeze against the sink. I stayed for one week as a single guest and the bed was quite large for one person. However, for two people, the room would have been too small. Therefore, I recommend it for singles but would ask you to get more information if you would like to book it for two guests. I presume that they also have larger rooms. However, I need to stress that in London, large hotel rooms for the same price as on the European continent are considered as luxury and are extremely overpriced. Therefore, Queensway Hotel is doing quite well and as far as I know you would hardly get anything larger for this price catagory in London. Another drawback was the matress, but I admit that this is a personal problem, because I easily get backache with spring coil matrasses. In this hotel, the matrass was brand-new and because I am a bit special with my back, I did not like it. Again, in Britain, the spring coil matrasses are largely over represented in contrast to the European continent where mainly foam matrasses are used.The hotel is not only outstanding for its tidyness but also for the readiness and helpfulness of the personal. When I did not want to sleep on the matrass, they instandly delivered me a lot of bed covers to improve my comfort on the matrass.A very good point: there is a lift, so that you do not have to carry your luggage all the way upstairs.The breakfast is ok, not exceptional but standard and immediately served.The hotel is very well located nearby Hyde Park and between two underground stations within a few minutes walk each. Also, Edgware Road, Marble Arch and the beginning of Oxford Street are easily done by foot. In all, I give Queensway Hotel a big thumb up. It is outstanding for its tidyness, friendly design and good service and well above the value for money compared to other London hotels."
22,1079,"Aug 20 2008 	Gymnastic ability required!	I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and it did not disapointed me at all... As a London traveller (I stayed in at least 5 diferent hotels in London) this is just what you normally expect for a small, tiny and simple London/Indian hotel. The rooms are small and the bathroom (if you can call that a bathroom) is very very tiny and you only fit there with a little gymnastic ability!! The elevator looks like reinvented from the past century and probably it will stop when you are inside, so it's better to take the stairs...The service is the basic and you can not count on a fabulous breakfast so it's better if you book without the small toast and orange juice!!! The location is great, just a short walk from paddington station wich takes you to all the tourist atractions in London.Overall, do not stay here if you are looking for a charm and confortable hotel, if you are backpacking this is just perfect, but if you want luxury forget it!"
23,1079,"Aug 11 2008 	The tiny rooms of Paddington	Rooms so tiny but at least new interiors. lcd tv and coffee making bathroom compact. All very compact. Compared to the decaying Normadie down the road this is preferred. Breakfast ok but a smile from any of the staff would not go a miss. In hub of the Paddington, many such establishments to choose from. This will probably compare up with the best for new interiors. Location is great if you need to be here. My final night in London on this trip, spent a little more and stayed at the Radisson Edwardian Provdence down by Canary Warf. COMFORT&gt;."
24,1079,Aug 2 2008 	Lovely hotel and area	We love the queensway and stay here everytime we are in london. The location is great near to paddington station. It is close to the airport and close to town. It is very clean and the breakfast is lov ely. Staff are friendly and the price is right.
25,1079,"Jul 26 2008 	Great location - REALLY tiny room	I chose this hotel based on location; its really close to Paddington Station and thus a really convenient base for a holiday. However, the room I had was the tiniest room Ive ever seen, about 2 meters x 3 meters in size. Absolutely no room to move around, I wasnt even able to open my suitcase on the floor as there was no room for it! There was a closet, but that was really small as well. There was absolutely no room to hang around, it was basically just a place to sleep. No room for anything else. Bathroom was a bit small too, but shower was quite nice, better than in some of the hotels in London. The bed and pillow were ok. Room had no view (the room was on the 1st floor). TV had lots of channels, and complimentary tea and coffee were nice. Breakfast was minimal; just toast, cereal, juice and coffee/tea.I recommend future guests bring earplugs as doors bang really loudly in the hall.Even though the room was so tiny, the Queensway Hotel was clean and in a nice location, so I think I would recommend it to others who are just looking for a place to sleep in."
26,1079,"Jul 12 2008 	Clean good location internet -- great for budget hotel	I paid 69 pounds/night for a 3 day stay in June, via Venere.com. Overall very positive experience, I would stay here again. Pros: - 5 min walk from Paddington station. Very convenient if you're taking the Heathrow express to/from Paddington. - very clean - strong reliable internet (in my room at least) - ensuite bathroom (tiny but functional) - ~5 min access to two tube stations - pleasant staff - a handful of restaurants and small shops nearby (all tourist oriented however). Supermarket nearby. Shops aren't all on the same street however, so you'll need to ask for directions and/or wander around a bit. - walking distance to Hyde Park - elevator to basement, 1, 2, 3 floors Cons: - the elevator doesn't go up to the 4th floor (which is built up in the old attic) and the stairs are fairly steep and narrow, so if you have difficulty carrying your luggage up stairs, you should ask for a room on a lower floor. - this is a budget tourist zone -- so if you want to eat at a nicer restaurant, or a &quot;locals&quot; restaurant, you'll likely need to eat elsewhere (although the Frontlne Club restaurant is nearby and it's great -- you will need reservations for it, unless you're lucky to get a seat at the bar)"
27,1079,Jun 29 2008 	Excellent	We stayed here for three nights and were impressed with the hotel. It was extremely clean and though the en suite bathrooms are very small they serve their purpose. The breakfast is adequate but as stated in previous reviews the juice and longlife milk are served at room temperature rather than chilled. Also the croissants are more like a bread roll than a traditional flakey croissant and the fruit salad is the tinned kind. However overall we were pleased with our choice and would stay again without hesitation.
28,1079,"Jun 26 2008 	compact and convenient	Booked two nights for convenience to Paddington and had single room (no 6). There are another 2 single rooms which I would recommend as no 6 is in the basement next to the breakfast room and an enclosed outside area with doors leading to breakfast area - so very noisy. Room clean and compact - please understand compact with capital C! My main complaint is the indifferent staff, moreso at breakfast. We came in and sat down at a table but were told (not asked) to go to small table. The milk jugs from tables recently vacated were poured into the main jug used to fill cereal bowls etc. - perhaps done out of sight might have been better! Hang on to your breakfast as it is cleared up post haste. Please try to sort this out as the milk situ is really not great to look at or hear and friendliness isn't in abundance.However if you need a place to put your head and want convenience miss out room no 6 and this is the place for you!"
29,1079,"Jun 26 2008 	Good location	Queensway Hotel is in a good location, near Paddington Station and Lanchaster Gate (get an Oyster Card if your there for a few days, you get the 3 refunded), very close to Hyde Park which is fantastic for a walk - to Buckingham Palace and Kensington.The hotel itself is fine, small rooms and very small en-suite, but it is sufficient. The Elevator isn't always working, I think they seem to turn it off at night, I guess this is good for the bedrooms next to it but not for those people that have to walk the stairs to the top floor! But we are still alive :)Rooms are clean and tidy, beds a little too soft for my liking! Breakfast was basic... tea/coffee, toast, ceral &amp; afew other bits!Staff - girl at reception desk very nice, everyone else ok but no one is rude, so thats good."
30,1079,"May 21 2008 	A good stay	We (parents + 5 year old child) had a good stay in this hotel. The hotel is close to Paddington station for trains, tube, and buses. Bus #15 that goes past most sites has a stop at the station, we used it for sightseeing. There are also a number of restaurants and pubs in the area. To us it seemed like a decent neighbourhood.We had a triple room, which was spacious. Even though the room was on the first floor facing Sussex Gardens, it wasn't noisy (despite the football finals that was played the weekend of our visit). The room and the hotel was clean, this was most important for us. We also got a third tea cup for the room when asked for it. There was only one small waste basket in the bathroom, but no trash bin in the room, so we had to pile up papers that we left behind on the floor.We also found it a bit strange to use the bed cover as blanket (there were no separate blankets).The breakfast included in the price was sufficient for us: tea, coffee, boiled eggs, cheese, jam, toast, cerials, yoghurt.Tea bags in the room were not replenished when the room was cleaned. I'm sure, though, that should we have wanted more, we would have got them from the reception.The only incident we had was with the hot water boiler, which went off on Sunday. The receptionist called us to check if we had hot water and when we said the water was only lukewarm, I thought they would have fixed it right away. We had to ask again the next morning; fortunately we weren't desperate for shower then. The boiler was fixed when we got back on Sunday evening.All in all, the stay was value for money and we would stay in this hotel again and recommend it to others."
31,1079,"Apr 7 2008 	Splendid hotel	Last week we stayed for 3 days in the Queensway Hotel. The hotel was more than we expected. It was recently refurbished. The reception was very nice with very friendly staff. Thanks to the staff for their excellent service. The room was on the second floor and was very clean with a small but beautifull bathroom. The hotel is situated on a top location, near Hyde Park and on two minutes from the underground (Paddington).We made the reservation with London Hotel Reservation Centre (LHRC) in Paddington. They had a great deal for us and booked also our discounted theatre tickets. The service was excellent. We had a great trip and will come back to the Queensway and book again our hotel with LHRC."
32,1079,"Mar 31 2008	Great stay!!	I was going to the theatre to see the 39 steps and needed a cheap but good quality place to stay. Found the Queensway through a google search and also checked on trip advisor for reviews. The hotel is situated about a 5min walk from Paddington tube station/train station. If coming out of the tube station - follow the sign for Praed Street. Once outside, cross the road and follow it until you come to Sussex Place, there is a pub called Sussex Place on the right hand side. Before crossing the road, you can see the hotel in front on the left. It is a lovely white building situated in amongst other hotels. The reception was clean and bright with a leather sofa and nice pictures. The receptionist was friendly and we got checked in before 1pm. My friend and I had a twin room. The beds were fab with lovely pillows (the best night sleep I have had in a while). The bathroom was modern (small) and the shower was good. It had tea/coffee facilities and a flat screen t.v. Nice view out onto the tree lined road and the window opened which was nice for a slight breeze. There were also extra pillows and a blanket. The room was 69 including breakfast, which is excellent for London. The only real downer was the breakfast. There was the choice of 3 cereals, yogurts, hard-boiled eggs and cheese, toast and juice. Unfortunately neither the milk nor juice were very cold which is a must when having cereal or fancy a nice cold drink first thing in the morning. The kitchen is quite basic so there is no option of having a cooked breakfast which is ok but it's best to mention this. The staff were nice and friendly though and supplied tea/coffee as required. The whole hotel has been refurbished and it shows. I would stay here again without fail as it's situated in a great location, handy for all of London. Definitely a no hassle hotel"
33,1079,"Jan 20 2008 	Great Little Hotel	This hotel is clean, comfortable and modern, at a very reasonable price (single room normally 69 but I booked last minute and paid just 49). The photos on this site are out of date - all the rooms shown here have been refurbished.I had a single room on the 4th floor (lift goes to 3rd floor then short flight of stairs). Room was small but perfect for my needs: bed, wardrobe, TV, kettle etc, phone, hairdryer, bathroom (mine had no bath, just shower). Everything was very clean and I spent a comfortable night. Continental breakfast in pleasant breakfast room was cereals, toast and tea/coffee (included in price of room). Note: If you prefer a cooked breakfast there are several restaurants around paddington station that you can walk to in a few minutes.The only negative comment I have is that the room was slightly too warm for me, even in January I hardly needed the bedding. But, I would rather that than it be too cold!Overall I was very impressed and would recommend this hotel to anyone needing a stopover for a night or two."
34,1079,"Dec 13 2007 	Cracking little hotel	I stayed in the Queensway Hotel in Sussex Gardens (Paddington) last night for the first time, but probably not the last.When I'm booking a hotel I want 6 things:1. Clean and tidy hotel2. Comfortable room and bed3. Good area and transport links4. Good service5. Safety (me and my belongings)6. Value for moneySo that is what I will use as the basis for this review.1. Clean and tidy hotel - The hotel looked nice from the outside and the entrance was clean, bright and welcoming. It had the look of a modern boutique hotel, with modern and comfy leather armchairs in the reception area. The room itself looked as though it had recently been decorated and seemed to be well maintained. The carpet was clean, the furniture dust free, and the bedding tidy and clean. The bathroom also looked to be quite new and was very clean. Thumbs up for clean and tidy.2. Comfortable room and bed - The room was accessed by a narrow corridor from the reception area and then another narrow path from the room door to the main bedroom area. This made it a little difficult to get into the room with a bulky bag, but this was not really a big deal. The room was well laid out with a small bedside table either side of the bed and two small lights above the bed. There was a double socket above one of the bedside tables and light switches for the bedside lights and the main room light located to the other side of the bed (which was quite handy). On the wall at the bottom of the bed was a small plasma screen TV (probably about 20-odd inch in size) with lots of freeview digital channels. There was a small desk next to the TV with a little stool under it which was adequate for a short period on my laptop, but no use as a proper desk (mostly because of the small stool). The bed was a good sized double that took up most of the space in the small room (but left enough room to get around) and was firm but comfortable. There was a central heating radiator in the room that could be manually adjusted (and worked when adjusted) and, although I couldn't see any air conditioning, there were two windows in the room that could be opened. The bathroom had a full bath with a shower over it which, although adequate, wasn't very powerful or particularly hot. For a single night, the shower was ok, but might have annoyed me with regular use. The rest of the bathroom was very clean and bright and I was happy to use it. I got a good night's sleep, so another thumbs up here.3. Good area and transport links - I don't know too much about the Paddington area, so I can't say too much about it. I usually stay in one of the large hotels down by Euston as my office is close by. I arrived at Paddington tube station, which is served by the Hammersmith and City, Circle, and District lines. It was pretty easy to get anywhere in the city using the tube from here, and there were lots of taxis flying around and at the station. It was a couple of hundred yards from the tube station to the hotel, and the same distance (roughly) to Paddington mainline station as well. There were lots of pubs and restaurants on the road down to the hotel (but not immediately outside the hotel itself) and in the surrounding area, as well as all the usual fast food places, little shops, and off-licences. The road outside and around the station looked like any other in London, but the street the hotel was on was a bit quieter (the road itself is quite busy, but the hotel is set back from the main road on a parallel road). I liked the location but it is not very central, so this might put some people off. For me, however, another thumbs up.4. Good service - I arrived quite early (about 10:30am) and was pleasantly greeted by the chap on reception. He made no mention of me checking in too early and went straight into looking for my reservation. He had a bit of trouble finding it, and it turns out my booking was misfiled (so they expected me a day later), but this was rectified pretty quickly with no problems from the hotel. Instead of complaining about me being early, the staff had a discussion about what rooms were available (free and already cleaned), but I said I would be happy to leave my bag and come back later in the afternoon, so they took my bag and stored it in their office while I was out. The people at the reception were chatty and friendly throughout. When I arrived back at about 5pm, I was met by another friendly chap who sorted out my room for me and got my bag. Check-out in the morning was quick, friendly, and accompanied by the same friendly chatting as the day before. I was left alone when in my room, and had no reason to complain about anything, but the service I did receive was pretty good. So, another thumbs up.5. Safety for me and my belongings - My safety was not an issue. The hotel seemed to be in a pretty decent area, the building itself was well lit, and the manned reception was right at the front door. The room door was operated by a keycard, which was pretty standard. The rooms have old sash and case style windows with nothing more than a little bolt to secure the window. My room was on the ground floor at the back of the hotel, with a ledge outside the window about the width of a footpath and a lot of climbable pipes, so access via the windows was a bit of a concern. Not a huge one (as I have no idea how you would even get to that ledge) but enough to make me want to secure my laptop somewhere. There is a safe in the room, but getting it to work was impossible. I follows the instructions to the letter but could not get the safe to lock shut. Each time I turned the handle, without entering my code first, the safe just opened. That wasn't too good. So, personal safety was not an issue at all, but safety of belongings was a little bit of a concern.6. Value for money - I paid 69 on [-] for my double room, which included continental breakfast. I had to leave very early, so didn't have the breakfast, but this seemed like very good value for money to me. This room had facilities at least as good as any Premier Inn or Travelodge (it's better than that, and cleaner!), and better than an Ibis, all of which cost more than 69 on a room only basis in London. I'd have to put the value for money as another thumbs up.Overall I think this is a cracking little hotel. It is especially suited for those stopping over from the airport, on business, or staying over after a night out. I wouldn't take my wife there for a romantic weekend, but I would be happy to take her there as a place to crash after a concert or something. I'd recommend the hotel quite highly, and will definitely be going back myself."
35,1079,"Dec 11 2007 	Decent place if you can get it cheap	I overpaid for this hotel. A single room with taxes cost about $350. This may be my fault, but this hotel is not worth $350 for two nights.I checked in and went to my room. It was a single and a little longer than I am tall and a little wider than I am wide. In other words: miniscule. I didn't really care because I just use rooms to sleep in after long days of business/sightseeing.However, the room was clearly occupied: there were two pairs of women' shoes on the floor, clothes on the bed, and a clearly regularly used bathroom with a messy mirror and hairy comb on the sink. I was given a new room when I pointed out the problems, but this never should have happened in the first place.The hotel is close to Paddington Station and the underground, and my new room was clean and miniscule. This place is acceptable if you get it cheap."
36,1079,"Nov 7 2007 	Queensway Hotel London	Just stayed in a double room in the Queensway Hotel. The room was lovely and a very good size. The hotel has just reopened after full refurbishment. Great location, close to everything but also where so pleased with the standard and very reasonable room rate. The bathroom is very nice but a bit small, could have done with a bit more space.The staff were very friendly.I will definately stay there again during my next visit, and would recomend it.Sallyann"
37,1079,Sep 25 2006	Good Price - Good Value	We stayed here for 1 night after a flight from the US. It is an easy walk from the Paddington Station where the Heathrow Express drops you off. The front desk staff was very nice and the rate of 59 pounds including taxes and a continental breakfast was hard to beat. The rooms are small and basic and I would not stay here for more than 2 nights. We felt safe in the area and we would stay here again.
38,1079,"Sep 19 2006 	Reasonable hotel very close to Paddington Station (for Heathrow Express)	Well, this is London, where I suspect you get less hotel for your money than in any other city in the world! With that in mind, this little hotel was quite good value for money. For around 55 pounds per night (including taxes) I got a small room with twin beds, tv, telephone, kettle, mugs &amp; tea bags/sugar/coffee whitener, wardrobe and private bathroom (WC and shower) and a light breakfast (cereals, toast and coffee).OK, space was very tight and the chest-of-drawers was probably a mistake. The built-in clock radio wasn't working, but the staff at the front desk arranged a wake up call for me.Apart from space, the only real down-side was the fact that the window opened only at the bottom and onto a 'juliet balcony' shared with the room next door: I didn't like leaving it open at night as it could be a security risk and the room then got a bit warm. I wouldn't want to say here in mid-summer, but early Autumn was OKThis hotel is only one street away from Paddington Station which makes it an ideal overnight location before taking an early morning train to Heathrow Airport."
39,1079,"Jun 27 2006	Good value for money	I stayed in this hotel with my friend and we really liked, the location is good and the rooms were clean (although a bit small) and the bathroom was very good. Also the breakfast was ok, nothing special, but a good start for the day. We didn't had any problems with any of the arrangements. It's not luxurious, but I don't think anyone can expect that with this price!"
40,1079,"May 25 2006	Frightening Stairs Broken windows Very thin walls but good location	After waiting in the lobby for 20 minutes, the reception realised that they have mixed up our booking which meant that our room was not reserved. Fortunately there was a vacant room and we stayed there. The room which was given to us was on the 4th floor, the lift only goes up to the 3rd floor so we needed to take a flight of stairs up to our room-- the stairs was so steep and narrow that it resembled one from a medieval castle. When we got into our room, we realised that the windows were made of rotten wood and one of them was broken. As a result, we had to leave that window open for the whole night. The walls were very thin, we could hear eveything that went on next door. The breakfast menu was poor and the kitchen staff was very rude. However, the reception staff was very polite and helpful. Despite of its great location (It is very close to Paddington Station), I will not return to this hotel again. It was simply a nightmare."
41,1079,"Apr 28 2006	Great location Hotel a bit run down.	We stayed at this Hotel for six days at the end of January, beginning of February 2006. The Hotel itself is only a few minutes walk from Paddington Station which you reach by boarding the Heathrow Express at the airport. Easy!The Hotel is a bit run down but the problem is the staff. There was only 1 coathanger in the cupboard for 2 of us, so I had to ask for more. There was no kettle in the room so they had to find one for us. The soap was never replaced in the bathroom so, again, we had to ask for more. The beds were strangely made up and needed to be remade every night before we slept They were hard and uncomfortable. The waste paper bins in the room and bathroom were only emptied if you put them in the middle of the room. The showerhead was lying in the tub when we arrived so I had to screw it back into its fixture in the wall. When you used the shower, water went everywhere as the shower screen wasn't fitted properly. If you wanted dry towels you needed to leave the wet towels on the floor. Some of the drawers in the bureau were broken and couldn't be used.The dining room was clean and when we were seated we were offered juice, tea and toast. There was cold cereal on a table for you to serve yourself. We made the mistake of assuming that was all there was. We didn't find out 'til later that you could have a cooked breakfast if you asked for it.The staff weren't rude but nore were they helpful, they just didn't care. The room was a good size and I know these are only small annoyances but, after having had such good experiences in Singapore, Scotland and Paris, I was disappointed that the staff in the Queensway didn't care about their paying guests. I would not stay there again."
42,1079,"Apr 9 2006	Good price good location	I have stayed in this hotel twice during the month of March 2006 and was happy with the room, the standard, the service and the location both times. The bathrooms are clean and seem to be newly renovated. The rooms are quite small, but still ok and equipped with tv, coffe machine and hair-dryers. Breakfast is included in the price. The location is less than 5 minutes walk from Paddington station which is very central. On the way to the undergroud you find restaurants, shops and an Internet caf. The staff is polite and helpful. I will recommend this hotel to my friends travelling to London, and I will definitely stay there again myself. It's a very good deal!"
43,1079,"Mar 18 2006 	Excellent Hotel especially for the money	This hotel is very reasonably priced, and was the only one in this area and price range with reasonable reviews here. It is only five minutes walk from Paddington station in an area with many hotels, and also a large number of restaurants of many different cuisines. Having stayed in a similarly priced hotel nearby a few weeks ago my expectations were low, but they were far exceeded. The hotel is in an excellent state of repair and appears to have been re-decorated very recently. My room was quite large with a double bed and an excellent bathroom with bath (shower over) and full sized basin. The staff all spoke good English and were polite and helpful. Breakfast was a bit restricted (the usual white toast), but was in a proper dining room in the basement and some people were having English breakfast, although this may have been at an extra charge.To sum up, I was very satisfied with what I got for my money, and shall certainly use it when I am in London on business aging soon."
44,1079,"Dec 17 2005	Good enough	Queensway Hotel is nothing out of the ordinary, but then you get what you pay for. The room was clean enough but a bit cold during my stay in december. I found all the necessary facilities I needed, including a hot shower, and cereals for breakfast. The staff was nice, except for one of the waitresses who turned me out of the breakfast room when I hadn't finished at exactly 9.30. The other morning she told me off when I placed myself at a table for four in order to have place for the paper to read. There where plenty of tables, it wasn't really a problem. So it wasn't the perfect stay, but good enough. It's on a comfortable walking distance from Hyde Park and Oxford Street. If you rather spend your money on shopping than lodgings, I could recommend it. Maybe I should add that if you're not fit enough to climb stairs, and feel uncomfortable in elevators that rock when you enter them, then ask the staff to give you a room on the ground floor."
45,1079,"Jul 19 2005 	Great Location Helpful Staff Good Rates!	I was looking for a cheap but conveniently located hotel near good transportation and in an interesting area. Queensway proved to be a good choice! I booked through the internet and got a great rate that included VAT and breakfast. The continental breakfast was decent and the staff was helpful. The Heathrow Airport express goes directly to Paddington Station and once I was on the street it was only a 5 minutes to walk to the hotel. There are parks nearby, good restaurants and sandwhich shops and Notting Hill is only a 10 minute bus ride away. The hotel room was clean, had cable TV and basic furniture. My room could have used a bathroom upgrade but other than that it was good basic accomidation with good service and the right price. There are several other hotel all side by side on the same street (Sussex Gardens) that had just finished upgrades and charged more. Check them out if you want a little fancier room and are willing to pay 10-20 pounds more per night."
46,1079,"Jun 18 2005 	A fair value	I stayed at the Queesway for a week. Queensway is a quite a fair deal compared with the price paid. The room is small but still at an acceptable size. Cleanliness was OK though the towels could have been changed more often. On the minus side the breakfast is very cheap. Only cereals, bread and a not-so-good tea or coffee. Also you have to pay 1 Pound a day to use the safe deposit. On the plus side the location is great. Just a short walk to Paddington and Hyde Park."
47,1079,"Dec 24 2004	nice hotel	i stayed at this hotel for 6 nights, and it was a plesent stay.the hotel is near the paddington undreground station (3-5 min. walk)and located at sussex gardens, an nice place with lots of hotels near by, quiet place.the room was a bit small, but it was ok since i stayed alone in it.ther were television and coffe facilities, clean towles and sheets.continental breakfest was included; coffe, toast, jam, butter, cornfalkes, milk, orange juice.the staff were very plesent and nice, and helped when i need anythingthe only thing that could have been better is more hitting in the room, it felt sometimes (not every day) a bitt cold in the room, but i dont know if its the cold in london or just the hitting system in the hotel.and sometimes you could hear your neighbours walking around their rooms (the floore makes noise..)for ending; its a good palce for 2 star hotel price."
48,1079,"Aug 31 2004	nice resonable priced hotel	I stayed in this hotel with my family for a week. It was resonably priced, lovely and clean and within walking distance of Oxford Street 5 minutes. Tube station (Paddington station) around the corner. The staff were lovely, and helpful. I would definitely stay there again."
49,1079,"Feb 26 2004	Great location and front desk staff	As one of the least expensive hotels I could find for our stay, I wasn't sure what to expect. The Queensway ended up to be quite decent for the price. The front desk staff was excellent. They were always friendly, smiling and helpful. The location was perfect - about 2 blocks from Paddington, yet quiet. There are some excellent pubs nearby, and some good restaurants if you want a full English breakfast rather than the meager cereal and toast the hotel offers. The rooms were small, but not unbearably so. My main complaint about our room was that the hand held shower head only came up to about our chest. We had to be a bit acrobatic to wash our hair. Otherwise, for a 2 star property, it was perfect for our needs. It was clean, when we needed anything extra (towels, toilet paper), they were on it right away and were very generous. I would stay here again when price was the most important issue."
50,1079,"Nov 13 2003	Good value	After a horrible night in a nearby hotel, I called the Queensway. They allowed me to inspect the room before booking, and only charged 65 pounds per night for 2 twin beds. Staff is extremely helpful - allowed us to check in early and stored our bags for the day when we checked out. Check out time is early - 10:30am. Rooms are spacious compared to others in its price range. Lots of closet &amp; dresser space. Did have to request things such as clean towels after the 3rd day, but the staff always accomodated our needs. Very convenient to Paddington station &amp; in a nice, quiet neighborhood."

1,1083,"Oct 27 2009 	Beware The Bedbugs	Do not visit this Hotel!Its the worst and dirtiest place Ive ever seen in my entire life and I was a Punk Rocker when I was young!We catched at least 100 stiches of bedbugs.If you are desperate finding a place to sleep in London, better search a bridge!"
2,1083,"Aug 14 2007 	Worst stay of my life so far!	Worst hotel stay of my life. Where to begin ... the first thing that we noticed was that the sink was permanently running. I asked the man running the place at the front desk (sadly, I did not catch his name, but he worked the night shift on August 11th, 2007) about what he could do. He lied to me on several occasions about what could be done. The story changed each time that I asked. We later noticed that the heater could not be turned off and that the room was permanently at a temp. approaching 80F (on a cool London night of about 55-60F). He replied that it is a UK thing that people like to have their rooms at that temperature and that it is that way in every room. Having stayed in the UK the two months leading up to this visit, I knew that he was simply continuing with his morally bankrupt manner as he was with the running sink. When I mentioned the sink again, he said that no one had actually ever complained about it before. I find it hard to believe that no one had ever complained about a sink running, that is 3 feet from your head as you sleep in a room that is 7 feet by 7 feet. The next pleasant surprise came at around 2am when the heater began making a load moaning sound. My girlfriend and had to wake up about every half hour for the rest of the night to kick the thing to make it stop.Long story short, avoid staying here at all costs. If London has anything similar to a better business bureau, this hotel should be reported and the deceitful man should be fired, fined and shunned from decent society. How he sleeps at night is a mystery, both with respect to the horrific conditions of the hotel and his complete lack of moral character.If no other place is available, as was the case in my situation, I would suggest sleeping at the Queensway Underground stop, or in a park, or on a sidewalk. At least you wouldn't have to be angered by blatant lies, unpleasant heat, and moaning noises all night. I'll risk being robbed over that any day."
3,1083,"Aug 3 2007 	Awful awful awful.. Don't do it!	It is a long time since I stayed here but I feel compelled to write this review so that others can avoid the experience we had. We were in London for a wedding in August 2006 and the groom very kindly arranged accomodation for all the guests..at The Queens. When we arrived the outside looked nice enough, however the receptionist was grumpy and sour. We were made pay cash on arrival which should have been the first clue. I had to change for a wedding, however as we arrived at 11.30 we were told that I would have to change in the cubicles in the toilets. My partner put his foot down and we were grudgingly given a room on the ground floor, we had explained that we didn't mind if the room wasn't made up and would be willing to wait.On the way we passed a trolley full of linen. The room smelled of smoke, the decor was peeling and the carpet was dusty. We returned later that night after the wedding. The bed was lumpy, the numbers were missing from the room doors and it was just not clean.We didn't bother staying for breakfast for the next day as we just wanted to leave. The only good thing about the hotel is that it is located to some nice cafes and shops so we found a lovely place for breakfast, but please, do NOT go here. Friends of ours had another room and noticed that there was an active trade going on at 2am...so be warned."
4,1083,"Jun 13 2007 	Just a dump!	I stayed at The Queens Hotel in Bayswater in May 2005, because i was deperate to find a cheap hotel in the area.I only stayed one night here, but that was enough.It was just 20 with a shared bathroom, but I wish I paid 20 more and stayed somewhere decent!!The outside of the hotel is ok, and the reception is at least habitable. There is a strong horrible smell which is undescriable through out the hotel.As i made my way to my room, I noticed the old warn down stairs that were about to collapsed. The hotel looked liked it hadnt been decorated in years.The rooms simply are disgraceful.I have never seen anything like it - the sink was full of mould, the cupboard was nackered, the wardrobe looked like it was nicked from the wreck of Titanic, the bed was old and broken ,the floor was filthy, the bed covers was disgusting, the walls had holes and pen marks all over, and even the ceeling had holes. The window has mould and dead flies across it, and even the small bedside table has a dead spider in the draw.The only thing that worked was the TV. The bathroom was tiny, shower didnt work, toilet was thilthy and the door didnt lock. It was shared between 4 or 5 rooms, although when ever i needed the toilet it always seemed avaliable. The bedroom door could have been easily kicked down - the lock was broken but closed (just).I could go on, there was so much bad things about this hotel! The noise was annoying, you could here people in the other rooms. I noticed a large family were staying in the room downstairs, it seemed they lived there because there was no room number on there door. PLEASE PLEASE dont stay here - YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED!Honestly spend 20 extra and stay somewhere at least clean."
5,1083,"Jun 11 2007 	Nightmare in Queen's Hotel	You can hear the toilet flush next door in the middle of the night. The bed is the worst you can get, no springs, dirty, etc etc. Toilets with no hot water, flow of water very very very slow. Surroundings very very dirty! Not recommended!"
6,1083,"Mar 20 2007 	Your worst nightmare	Well, if your looking to stay in a value for money hotel in the heart of London I would strongly recommend not staying here. The door mat caked in dirt should have made the penny drop that this hotel wasn't value for money. The reception area is dirty and the clocks on the wall informed us of the time in New york, Hong Kong, Sydney etc etc. This would have been all the more informative if the actual clocks had been present.As for the room.....specks of blood all over the bed headboard, the bathroom smelled similar to a public toilet, holes in the carpet and just generally dirty. It is a truly awful hotel."

2,1084,"Nov 25 2009 	Perfectly and descreetly situated just off the hustle an bustle of Oxford Street.	I visited The Berkshire last week and would concur it is a cut above. Price wise its what you expect from a 4 star hotel and it ticks all the boxes in terms of location, room size, bar and restaurant. It doesn't have leisure facilities, but why would you want any when you have hyde park a stones throw away. Good hotel and will definately go back"
3,1084,"Nov 23 2009 	Better than most London Hotels at a decent rate	I travel to London a few times a year and rarely stay at the same hotel as I am frequently dissapointed. Generally London hotels have one star too much when compared to same star level in most other countries unless your budget allows you to stay at the absolute best, which again are completely overpriced compared to the best hotels in most other countries. Recently I stayed at the Radisson Edwardian Berkshire Hotel and I will most likely stay here again next time I am in London. It is centrally situated and has a fairly decent standard. I made sure to book a room with a King Size bed to make sure I did not get too small a room. The staff was also very helpfull."

5,1084,"Nov 1 2009 	Great Location Nice Hotel	Clean well appointed hotel, room on small side but nicely furnished. Free wifi was a bonus. Only one elevator in working order over 3 day stay was disappointing but otherwise would certainly stay here again."
6,1084,"Oct 22 2009 	The room may be a little small but as the location is convenient and service is superb it is recommended.	Located right off Oxford street, this is a convenient stay if you are doing business in the centre of London. Rooms are a little small, but appart from a lift that was not working, service was superb and staff were friendly."
7,1084,"Oct 20 2009 	Go if under 120 pounds shop around if at 150.	It is a Radisson, so I will not spend too much time describing how good it is. It delivers on the quality you can expect from this chain. Also necessary to consider that standard room does not give you any serious thrills. Serious minus that my room had was the noise from the Oxford street which start early and finishes late. A shut window doesn't help and the horns of cars can be heard very clearly. Our windows were on the same side as the entrabce (not towards Oxford street, but on the side street) and we were on first floor, so you probably can ask for something quiter. My experince with the area is that at 150 you can find a better option (check out my Mandeville hotel review). At 120 Radisson becomes a very good choice."
8,1084,"Oct 6 2009 	Fantastic location great service	I flew all night from Bahrain to London and showered at the BA arrivals lounge because I didn't think I would be allowed to occupy my room. Imagine my surprise when I checked in at 9 a.m. and was told I could go right to my room if I wanted! the room was big, had windows that opened, and was more than ample for my needs. I did have difficulty locating an electrical outlet so I could charge my laptop and cell phone, but only a minor inconvenience. The hotel is right across the street from the Bond Street Station on the Central line of the Underground. Despite the busy neighborhood, I still had a peaceful night's sleep. I have stayed here before on business and consider this a fantastic location and appreciate the amenities it affords me. Will definitely stay here again."
9,1084,"Oct 5 2009 	Just Perfect	Though we arrived early, we were immediately allowed to occupy the room. The receptionist and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Even a welcoming phone message was left should we needed any help. The free wireless internet was available for immediate use. As for the location, it can't be any better, right on Oxford Street , next to Debenhams, yet, not noisy at all. Unlike similar star-rated hotels in London, the room was spacious and comfortable. The hotel lounge was bright and comfortable, too. We simply loved this Hotel, it is just perfect."
10,1084,"Sep 23 2009 	Fantastic customer service	The service was so amazing during my recent stay at the hotel - the staff were so friendly and accomodating and it was a refreshing change for a hotel in London! The location was perfect - right opposite bond street tube and 5 mins walk to oxford circus.Rooms were very pleasant, good quality furnishings, good shower, comfy beds - the only thing I would add is that freeview channels would be a good thing to add to the tv facility. Food was a really good standard - i had the steak sandwich (would highly recommend) as room service and the breakfast the following mornig was fantastic. The waitres with the red curly hair was in particular so nice and helpful and was constantly scanning the room to see the next guest she could help.All in all - a great hotel!"
11,1084,Sep 23 2009 	I really enjoyed the quality of service I did receive during my stay	High quality of serviceFlexibility Availiability to all my requirements
12,1084,"Sep 11 2009 	Excellent location Friendly 	I was very impressed by the Berkshire - amazing location on Oxford Street, close to Bond Street station - very easy place to be based to get around London. Staff were exceptionally helpful, friendly and professional and made my stay at this hotel very enjoyable. The staff were very knowledgeable and made great recommendations for my leisure time. Hotel nicely furnished, very clean &amp; accommodating.Highly recommend this hotel because of it's great location and staff."
13,1084,"Sep 10 2009 	Yet another great stay at this hotel	This is one of my favourit hotels. Great service, good food, nice rooms and the location could not be better. I have stayd here several timeas and will do it again."
14,1084,"Aug 11 2009	Excellent Service Value for Money and Central Location	We arrived early for our stay and the staff could not be friendlier. They had our room ready, which enabled us to have access to our room immediately. The booking in process was efficient.The location of the hotel, on Oxford Street is a real bonus as we were able to do some shopping and return to the hotel periodically for a rest and an excellent cup of coffee. We also visited a local restaurant just off Oxford Street for an evening meal.We stayed in a twin room on the eighth floor, which was quiet. The room was pleasantly decorated with plenty of space, TV, tea/coffee-making facilities. The hotel was extremely clean throughout.. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay again."
15,1084,"Aug 10 2009 	Perfect location but not quite as good as other Radissons	I stayed here with my mum from 22nd to 24th June this year, for our first trip to Wimbledon on 23rd. We chose the hotel as we had loved the two Radissons we had stayed in previously (Mountbatten &amp; Hampshire), and the location was perfect for our shopping plans on the other two days of our trip. I wasn't too happy with the price of 295 per night, as booked through the Radisson website, but as I have a long term health problem, I couldn't take advantage of the early booker 20% off rate as I may have needed to cancel. However, upon arrival we were upgraded to a better room. The room itself was adequately proportioned, with a neat bathroom and small sitting alcove. It had all mod cons, including a Bang &amp; Olufson TV. Everything was very clean, and the staff had clearly adhered to our request for no cleaning fluids to be used due to allergies. But the major selling point had to be the bed - SOOOO comfortable! I don't tend to sleep well away from home but this bed really helped me to sleep. The main thing we love about Radissons is the cooked English breakfast. Since our last visit, this had changed from waiter to buffet service, but the food was still the same outstanding quality, and it worked out better as we could take more of what we wanted and miss out what we didn't. We had mixed feelings about our one evening meal. My burger and chips was absoloutely delicious, but my mum's lamb was quite tough.The staff at this hotel were all lovely and helpful. Whilst the location was perfect for shopping, it did make it hard to relax being on a main shopping street, and Boots was lit up bright red outside our room at night! Also not keen on the restaurant being upstairs and no lobby area to relax in.Overall, the rooms, service, staff and food lived up to our previous Radissson experiences, but the layout and lack of the large lobby decked out with sofas found in other Radissons left it slightly trailing its sister hotels."
16,1084,"Aug 4 2009 	DO NOT STAY HERE!!	I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, apart from it's the great location on Oxford Street; the Hotel has NOTHING going for it!! BE WARNED.... AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS!!I booked a birthday weekend in London for my partner, and intended to make the most of our weekend in London. (End of July 2009)To cut a VERY long story short, we arrived and were turned away from the hotel, 4 different times, before finally being allowed to 'Check-In' to our room at 5pm! The website clearly states you can have your room from 2pm, but the rude lobby staff kept giving the same excuse 'Housekeeping are busy at weekends'.As i told them, its not the guests problem; if you are aware youre understaffed at weekends, employ more housekeepers? I paid 150 per night, for a room i wasnt allowed until 5pm, on my partners birthday, we had arrange to meet some close family and friends for a birthday dinner and drinks before going to see a show. The weekend was completely ruined, we could not meet our family and friends for drinks and dinner, as by the time we were both ready, we had to go straight to the show.I found the attitude of every member of staff disgusting! I stay in hotels around the world due to the nature of my job, and can say, even Travelodge have better customer care and customer service skills than the Radisson Edwardian Berkshire.I normally LOVE Radisson hotels, and have yet to find a bad one, until now.. The Berkshire...Like other reviews mentions:The rooms are standard, nothing great. Small in size, and the rooms and carpets are all getting a bit grubby. No complimentary products in the bathroom (shower cap etc), which is also tiny, so tiny its just a toilet, shower and sink.The hotels restaurant food was average. As for any kind of atmosphere in the restaurant, bar area, forget it. Its like the entrance of a funeral parlour.I recommend searching alternative accommodation in central London if planning a visit.Would i stay again? ...... Never!"
17,1084,"Aug 4 2009 	Great hotel in a great location	I booked a night in this hotel last weekend via lastminute.com and got a good rate. Upon arrival at the hotel I was greeted by a very attentive and polite receptionist. The service in that regard can't be faulted. As other's have pointed out in their reviews, the rooms in this hotel are small so if you're of a fuller figure then you may wish to look elsewhere as the shower in particular can be a bit of a squeeze. With that said, my room was immaculate and in great condition. It was beautifully furnished and had a range of facilities including a safe, iron and ironing board, mini bar and complimentary toiletries.The location of this hotel is great and, whilst it's small, for the price I paid (68 per night) I think it would be unreasonable to expect grandeur and space in such a prime location. An excellent place to stay if you're in London for a spot of serious shopping. Despite the prime location, I also found that noise was not a problem and I had a very restful night's sleep (much needed too!)My only complaints about this hotel would be the cost of breakfast (17 GBP), the price of items from the minibar (2.25 for a Kitkat!) and the lack of decent channels on the television."
18,1084,"Aug 1 2009 	Small but adequate	A good, well run hotel.The rooms are small, really small. If you have ever worked offshore you will know what I mean.Location is excellent, and that was the the whole purpose of staying at this hotel, so unless you are a 25 stone obese the small rooms are acceptable.The breakfast is well presented and of good quality. The staff are freindly and helpful.If I was to offer advise to the management of the hotel, I would say to them that the check-in area is to dark and sombre. It's such a small area that it should be brightened up to give the new arrival a better welcome.That being said, it's a fine hotel and I would recommend it."
19,1084,"Jul 31 2009 	Not worth the money	Last week (23/24 July) we went to London and stayed at the Radisson Edwardian Berkshire Oxford Street hotel. We had a reasonable rate from the internet and reports on Tripadvisor were very good. As it was a 4+* hotel we were excited about staying there.Check-in went smoothly and the lady on reception was very nice. She offered us the choice of two rooms (one at the front or one at the back of the hotel) and we decided to go with room 721 at the front of the hotel.The hotel has two lifts - each carrying a maximum of four people. Yes, that's right, only FOUR people in each lift! They are sooooo very tiny and old and rickety. They have been modernised in that you use your room key card to operate the lift, but they are still incredibly slow and old. My fianc is 6' 7&quot; and his head touched the ceiling  thank goodness the lift didn't stop suddenly else he'd have had a very sore head! When the lifts did stop there was quite a large step up from the lift to the floor outside which was awkward, especially with suitcases.When we got to the room we were quite impressed. It was very large with three windows and view looking down Oxford Street  you couldn't have got closer to the shops if you'd have tried! We had a double bed as requested (very comfortable) and for some reason a blow-up single bed in the corner too.Upon closer inspection, however, we started to feel very disappointed and I'm afraid to say that the report from here isn't that good.We couldn't find any drawers in the room anywhere, with one exception which was in the wardrobe and had the kettle and tea and coffee making facilities in it  no room for anything else. As a girlie I like to put my undies in a drawer but had to make do with the shelf in the wardrobe; my other half just left his in the suitcase.The bathroom was quite large and adequate for what we needed. There were no little bottles of shower gel/shampoo etc, but there were large pump action bottles provided in the shower and by the basin which were very nice (Gilchrist &amp; Soames). The shower was quite powerful, however, the water kept going hot and cold which was quite unpleasant. There was an extractor fan in the ceiling but it didn't work so you had to leave the bathroom door open, and even then the room still got very very steamy.Towelling robes were provided free which were lovely, but in the room 'handbook' it says you will be charged 95 if you take one home with you, so be warned!Having spent 10 minutes hunting for the hairdryer we found it in the wardrobe of all places  where everything else seemed to be; the kettle, tea/coffee, safe, mini bar, suitcase stand, iron and ironing board, trouser press, mirror. In fact, not much room for any clothes!Having to use the hairdryer in the wardrobe was an interesting experience to say the least! Who wants to dry their hair in a hot, tiny cupboard getting hairs all over their newly pressed clothes??! What a bizarre set up! Using my hair straighteners was very awkward too. There was a sort of dressing table against one wall in the bedroom but there wasn't a mirror above it, nor any plug sockets nearby. There was a plug socket right next to the entrance door to the bedroom which was no use whatsoever. The only other sockets were in a floor box under the table by the sofa (like the floor boxes you get at work!). So I had to go scrabbling about on my hands and knees to plug my straighteners in. Good job I'd brought a travel mirror with me as again there was no mirror nearby.The bedside lights weren't really by the bedside. They were actually spotlights in the ceiling above each side of the bed which were incredibly bright and blinding. The switches were too far away from the bed when you were lying there and you had to lean right over to turn them off.One thing which we cannot fault is the location of the hotel. It is in the heart of Oxford Street, about 10 steps from Debenhams. Selfridges is just down the road and Bond Street tube is close by too.Breakfast the first morning was disappointing. We arrived at about 9.00am and were shown to a table. The lady said that breakfast wasn't included in our room rate  we challenged this so she went off to check with reception. After we'd ordered our tea and toast she came back and confirmed that indeed breakfast wasn't included and we would be charged - 17 EACH!!! Seeing as it was so expensive we decided to get our money's worth and piled our plates high! The quality of the food was good; however, the temperature was cold. It was a buffet style and the spoons used to serve were very hot and I had to use a napkin to hold them. But between the time it takes to fill your plate and then get back to your table, the food had gone cold, so the food couldn't have been that hot in the first place. The selection was good with all the usual  bacon, sausage, beans, croissants, juices, yoghurt etc etc.The second morning we didn't make that mistake again and went out for breakfast.We can't comment on the bar or restaurant as we didn't use them.Check-out was very slow. There were a few people in front of us so the guy at the concierge desk helped out. We checked our bill, as we always do, and found that when we booked the prices on their website for accommodation did not include VAT. The concierge asked if we'd had a good stay and we pointed out a few of the above items but decided to keep it brief else we'd have been there for a while!Overall we wouldn't say this was a 4 star hotel and were very disappointed.Would we stay there again? Only if we managed to get a good room rate, as the location is fantastic and can't be faulted."
20,1084,"Jul 29 2009 	Nicest hotel I've ever stayed at.	Before even making my booking at this hotel I'd read through loads of reviews on TripAdvisor checking that everything would be OK. This hotel was by far the best from the hotels I had in mind, most of the reviews being positive. It was worrying therefore to find some of the latest reviews negative, involving the use of lifts etc. The lifts seemed to work fine, we managed to get 5 in our lift and it still went up and down! Although the gap to step up did get a little bigger. The man who entered the lift to make 5 wasn't exactly the lightest person to say the least!We booked a basic room with breakfast for an excellent rate, as it was my girlfriends birthday the manager generously upgraded our room, making our rate even more excellent. The room we stayed in was a King Deluxe Suite I think, or something of a similar name. The service was good, I was given a free drink from the bar due a small delay and the staff offered to carry our bags up to the room.The rooms cleanliness was of an outstanding quality, however after finding a sandal under the bed upon leaving it did put doubts in our mind how much they actually cleaned! But it seemed like they did a pretty good job. Our room came with two tables, a king size bed, a couch, large CRT Television which was a good brand, forget now, but the sound was excellent, got the general coffee and tea making facilities also an iron, safe, mini bar etc, I could go on! The mini bar was one of those ones that have scales in, so after hearing from my girlfriend while we were at the theatre that she'd picked up a can of lemonade to inspect the ingredients I was rather worried, luckily one can view the updated version of the bill on the tv! No charge was made! Phew! Also, another thing to mention, if you're traveling alone there is a built in chain on the door, it's rather stylish, but very easy to use and literally works with the flick of a switch!!The bathroom was all marble, even the walls and the shower was powerful. Got soap and shampoo included in the room, it seemed to make my hair nice and soft, softer than it usually is! The bathroom could have done with a bit more of a scrub in between the slabs of marble, other than that it couldn't really be faulted! The breakfast was also good, quite expensive if you don't book it with your room rate at 17 per person, is it worth it? I wouldn't say it was worth it, but hotels are over priced so a price around that ball park figure was to be expected. We got the breakfast included so we didn't pay the full price, it was definitely worth the little extra we paid. It was a full english breakfast with options such as porridge, pancakes, croissants, cereals etc... basically everything you would want with some extra options for an extra charge, no thanks!Overall the service was outstanding, I never actually met the manager (not to my knowledge), but he seemed to be a nice fellow and the staff seemed well trained!A 2 course meal was available in the restaurant for 15 which I thought was a very reasonable deal, especially since it was a restaurant, in-fact any restaurant that'd be a good deal, you can even pre-book online, I was tempted, but being students we don't like anything other than burgers and chips, and they weren't on the menu!!Anyway, yeah would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to london, excellent location, we walked from the hotel to the prince of wales theatre, easy 10-15 minute walk. London was very busy though, obviously because of the summer holidays! Went to the wax works too, well worth the wait! I'm glad the hotel entrance is not actually on Oxford street otherwise you'd be pushing your way past people just to get in and out! Tube also very convenient just across the road, great for getting there from St Pancras!"
21,1084,"Jul 20 2009 	recommendable	A nice not to big hotel..the situation is perfect..only a few steps away from the bond street underground station..near to piccadilly circus near to the hyde park.. for my next london trip , for sure i would stay there again."
22,1084,Jul 18 2009 	Great Location	We only had one night here but it was great. We were going to a party just off Bond St so I was looking for a nice hotel as close as possible. This could not have been better.It was a five minute walk to the party venue and was right in the middle of the shopping area in Oxford St. The room was lovely with a very nice large bed. Nice bathroom with big bath. Great sound proofing so no noise from the street.Very friendly helpful staff. We needed directions to the party venue and the man on the front desk googled and printed us out a map. Very efficient.Fantastic english breakfast included in the room rate.Expensive for us Kiwis with the NZ dollar but well worth the splurge.
23,1084,"Jul 15 2009 	THE BEST HOTEL ON OXFORD STREET!!	we stayed at the berkshire for 10 nights and this was our best experience , we had stayed at the cumberland and thistle both ,location wise all three are the same but what makes berkshire stand out is its 5 star service and the rooms they are bigger than both the other hotels and are more newly renovated , mr paul kennedy the hotel manager is very good at his job the hotel is running at 100 percent occupancy and during this time no manager bothers with the guest request as they are so busy but mr paul made sure that our any request should not go unanswered .if you are looking at spending a nice holiday in central london and want to stay right on oxford street there is no better choice than this hotel its number one hotel ."
24,1084,Jul 14 2009 	Great hotel and brilliant location would defiantly stay again!!	I went to London for a weekend of shopping and going out. I booked this hotel as I noticed it was a really central location. I was not disappointed when I turned up. My room overlooked Oxford Street so the location was perfect.The rooms are a really good size nicely decorated and with a very comfy bed. The staff were all very friendly. They were more than happy to advise on place to eat and go out and sorted out a taxi for me and a friend for the night.I would really recommend this hotel!!
25,1084,Jul 13 2009 	Wont stay again. small pokey room . look for better value for your money	Stayed there the other night with my girlfriend and her 2 sisters. had 2 rooms booked. A double for us and a twin. Got to reservation they only had 2 rooms left both double. Whats the point in making a reservation and paying extra for twin room. Kept saying were fully booked. I had booked 3 months ago.Lifts are dangerous. there is a 6 inch step when you get off the lift as it does not come flush with Floor and its a very squashed lift at that.The room is cluttered . can barely walk between bed and stupid table and chair that the room is too small for. If they had an lcd instead of old tv it would look less cluttered. Breakfast was ok and some of staff friendly although i was overall dissapointed . I spent nearly 400 pounds for 4 of us to stay here but in hind sight its only worth less than half of that. Location is good for shopping but i wont stay again
26,1084,"Jul 9 2009 	Wouldn't stay again	Disappointing hotel, lifts constantly out of order (when working, restricted to 3 persons instead of the allocated 4, a little worrying in itself!!!), no remote control for TV, no Rose wine in Bar &amp; room very basic &amp; bland. Also no electric socket anywhere near a mirror for using hair-straightners"
27,1084,"Jul 8 2009 	great location	great location on Oxford st., big rooms, friendly staff, free internet and of course reasonable price."
28,1084,"Jul 7 2009 	Good Location shame about the room	The hotel is situated in a good location being just across the road from Bond Street tube station and about a 10 minute walk from Oxford Circus station. Check in time at the hotel is 2pm, we got there for 215 and tried to check in- we were told we would be having a twin room as booked but our room wouldnt be ready for another hour and a half! Leaving the bags we went for a wander. When we got back to the hotel our room was ready only when we got to the room it turned out to be a double - I was with a friend so this wasn't convenient. I telephoned reception to explain that we had been given the wrong room and was told they would call us back as soon as possible. An hour later we still hadn't heard anything so rang them again to be told that there where no twin rooms available and we would have to stay put but another bed could be put in the room (it was small enough to start with), nearly another hour later a member of staff came with an air bed - rather poor service that we had to wait for 2 hours for something to be sorted when we wanted to go back out. We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and on the 2nd day a member of staff visited our room around 3.30pm to say they could move us - a bit late in the day when we were just leaving to go to a concert and wouldnt get back until late - unfortunately we didnt have the time to move!Breakfast in the hotel was a buffet with a good choice of food available. I would return back to the hotel but only if they sorted the rooms out first - very poor that it took so long to sort the situation out."
29,1084,"Jun 27 2009 	A pleasant stay	Extremely well located on Oxford Street near Bond Street tube. Room was nicely appointed with a very comfortable bed. We had breakfast included and the buffet breakfast was very good indeed, especially the scrambled egg. I appreciated the complimentary wi-fi.The only down point that stops me giving the hotel 5/5 was that the room was a little bit dusty in places and there was a quite a strong smell of mildew in the bathroom, however this went away after we used the shower.Given the location and level of service/accomodation, the deal we got was very good value and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would stay there again."
30,1084,"Jun 24 2009 	Great Location 	Check in was quick and hassle free.We prepaid GBP 140 per night (no breakfast) but I think we may have got an upgraded room as it had a couch and was a bit more spacious.Rooms were spotless, nicely furnished (nice tv). Bathroom was more than adequate.This was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.Oh, and location is perfect too, for shopping along Oxford street, and only a few minutes from Soho or Covent Garden for plenty of nightlife.I would definitely stay at this hotel again.When we were checking out there was some hassle (a couple of drama queens whinging and going nuts about having to bring luggage from their rooms themselves). The staff handled themselves extremely well in the face of completely undeserved abuse from those 2 guests."
31,1084,"Jun 18 2009 	Best location in London -- but reasonable	I get to London from Canada about once a year. I always stay at the Radisson, 350 Oxford St. It is a block or two away from Selfridges, within walking distance of many theatres and surrounded by reasonable restaurants. As you know, when you are traveling, it is all about location. But the service and amenities are good too.L.C."
32,1084,"Jun 11 2009	Excellent Hotel staff location	I dont often write reviews, but I feel that I have to say a huge thank you to the staff at the Raddison Berkshire London, I had taken my staff to London as a reward for hard work during the last finacial year, I wanted a quality hotel, in an exceptional location close to the shopping, west end, and generally central, as my party is of a mixed age and requirements: The Berkshire exceeded all expectations, Central, just off New bond street and Oxford street, the rooms were modern clean and very comfortable, the breakfast was exceptional, and the staff were extremely helpful polite, and Fun: 10 out of 10 for this very pleasant hotel and also not too expensisve : well done all:"
33,1084,"Jun 9 2009 	Clean great location friendly staff	We just returned from this nice hotel on Oxford Street. The location was great for shopping and right next to Bond Metro (Tube) Station. We walked to Soho, a nice area for restaurants and pubs. We had breakfast included and it was pretty good (some smoked salmon and more vegetables would have been nice)."
34,1084,"May 24 2009 	cleanfriendly and location excellent. Five stars all the way	We stayed two nights for my 40th birthday, staff were helpful and friendly. Given the location in Oxford street, the hotel was very well priced( including breakfast). Rooms were clean and tidy and ascots restaurant was also first class. we will definately be booking another trip in the near furture. Will be recommending this hotel to all our friends and family."
35,1084,"May 11 2009 	lovely hotel excellent location	Great location, very friendly staff, comfortable room and good breakfast. Booked via Bookings which included breakfast - good value. Just in front Bond Tube Station and lot of buses . Good for shopping!"
36,1084,"May 8 2009 	Experience was excellent.	Service, food, room, location and common areas combined to create good value."
37,1084,"May 7 2009 	Great Hotel in Great Location	My wife and I recently had a one-night stay at this hotel, with a view to a West End show and see the London Marathon. I have had previously bad experiences with west end hotels were the reception is all glitz but the rooms are Dickensian. This hotel is definitely not like that at all. In fact the reception area is quite small and understated but everything else about the hotel is first class. First the location: on the north side of Oxford St and right opposite Bond St station and only minutes walk away from Oxford St and Regent St shopping. Piccadilly Circus (for theatreland) is two stops away on the Tube. There is a 2pm check-in which is great if you only have one day and want to make as much use of it as possible. Actually we arrived at around 2.40pm and our standard room was not ready so we were given a free upgrade (we didn't have to ask). Great start!The room was beautifully presented, spotless and spacious. The bathroom was modern and had classy amenities.The ground floor bar was quiet and relaxing for cocktails at the end of the evening. Breakfast was buffet style and definitely above average. Checkout was easy and painless.All of the staff we had contact with were pleasant and helpful and treated us like valued guests.We will definitely stay here again when next in London."
38,1084,"May 3 2009 	very comfortable night's stay	Great location, very friendly staff, comfortable room and excellent breakfast. Booked via Yeego which included breakfast - good value. Free wifi."
39,1084,"Apr 27 2009 	Highly recommended	My husband and I stayed here at the weekend for a leisure break in London. The Location could not be better, right on Oxford street, oppsite Bond street tube, we were able to walk to all the shops, sites and restaurants. The hotel is very stylish and comfortable, the rooms are fairly small but have everything you would need and are very comfortable, the only small problems were that the window didnt stay open so you couldnt get any fresh air in the room so despite the air conditioning it was a little warm and stuffy but if it had been open it probably would have been rather noisy as we overlooked the main road but for me it was worth it to be in such a great spot. The breakfast was buffet style, I ordered the eggs benidict for which i payed a supplement. I had to wait a long time for it and it was nothing special, with hindsight i should have just had the buffet breakfast which my husband thoroughly enjoyed. The service was excellent and the staff were very pleasant.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a hotel in the heart of london with access to all of the sites."
40,1084,"Apr 27 2009 	lovely hotel excellent location	excellent location for shopping, two minute walk from bond st tube. very nice clean room, friendly staff. will definitely stay again."
41,1084,"Apr 26 2009 	Almost Perfect	My stay with Radisson Edwardian Berkshire, was more than excellent overall. The Location was prime, and the hotel staff were great professionals. The Privacy I felt during my stay, made my stay enjoyable, while still in the middle of all the attractions and just a walk away from major centrepoint areas. The only draw back during my stay was the WIFI connection. Although it comes for free with the room, the signal was low, and cuts off at times. Other than that, I recommend this hotel to everyone, and I will defenitely stay there again."
42,1084,"Apr 22 2009 	Great Location for a City Break	Stayed over for a night while meeting with some friends.Right on Oxford street which is great for shopping, resturants, bars and night clubs.Breakfast was good with friendly service."
43,1084,"Apr 19 2009 	Perfect	It was a mother and daughter (20 years old) vacation. Leisure , shopping and fun. The Hotel is located in a perfect location, we had a deluxe double bed room, so it was big and comfortable. The service was outstanding. To conclude, it is a highly recommended hotel."
44,1084,"Mar 19 2009 	Highly recommend would return again	Perfect location for shopping right on Oxford Street, short distance to theatre which is what we did. Had a fab nights sleep in the comfortable rooms, have a few rooms which are still smoking rooms which was good for half the group I travelled with. Breakfast the following monrning was brilliant, 1 of the best in London I've had in a long time.Lot's of people checking out the same time on the Sunday morning but, was extremly quick we'd also received a discount for the NCP car park behind the hotel which was an added bonus. Would return."
45,1084,Mar 8 2009 	shopping central	This hotel was perfectly based for those week end shopping trips with the social dining and culture together.The staff were multi lingual friendly and available eager to assist when needed.The communal areas have the feel of modern comfortable luxury living.The rooms are equally luxurious and comfortable with all the ammenities you would expect from such a standard I stayed here with girl friends and enjoyed a wonderful weekend in the capital the central location had a safe feel to it with direct access to tubes and bus routes to get to all locations.
46,1084,"Mar 8 2009 	Perfect London base	Just off Oxford Street, the hotel is also a short walk away from the many lovely restarants in St Christopher's Place and James Road (which provide a touch of Paris in London).Also, as Bond Street is on the Jubilee Line, the hotel is a good base for travellers to Wembley and the O2 stadium."
47,1084,"Mar 7 2009 	Location x 3	This hotel is located literally a stones throw from Oxford Street, perfect for high street shopping. We were also going to the london palladium, a walking distance of 7 mins away, we did take a cab due to high heels. Oxford Circus tube station is also only 5 mins walk from the hotel. The service in the bar was excellent. Our room wasn't ready on arrival due to a miscommunicated error but the hotel took our bags while we shopped. The room(3 of us sharing), cost about 300 which inc a buffet breakfast which was lovely and very filling. I'd definitely go back to this hotel, staff, rooms and location were perfect."
48,1084,"Mar 5 2009 	brilliant location	brillian location - couldn't be better in fact!! rooms slightly on the small side but extremely comfortably, trendy and clean - will definitely stay there again."
49,1084,"Mar 3 2009 	Excellent!!	Top location, In the centre of Oxford Street &amp; Bond St Tube Station a minutes walk away, Ideal for shopping and transport , and we proved you could easily walk to most locations, Bond Street, Regent Street, Piccadilly, Etc From check in the service was first class, the concierge was excellent and all staff through out our stay were friendly, helpful and very courteous, I honestly can't fault anything about our stay and would certainly come back to stay there again, a very pleasing hotel stay from myself and my wife"
50,1084,Feb 25 2009 	Excellent hotel is splendid location	We had a very enjoyable stay here. The staff were friendly and the room was excellent. There was free internet access which was a selling point for me because I needed to work during the afternoon.
51,1084,"Jan 17 2009 	Good location some things fine but appalling treatment	I stayed in this hotel for 1 night on business. It is in a great location and the rooms were comfortable but a little on the small side and dated. The TV system is also very limited. It needs updating but was reasonable value.The buffet breakfast was fine and staff were very helpful and efficient..... until I left some property in the bedroom.Stupidly I forgot an important piece of medical equipment that I need to use every night. It really is vital to me. I left it in the room and didnt realise it was missing until I got home. Next day I called the hotel and they were very helpful. Housekeeping had found it and they would post it to me but I would have to pay the cost. I was delighted and immediately emailed them with my credit card details.Nothing happened. The item didnt arrive. I assumed that with the Chrismas post it must be delayed and was forced to get a replacement. . In January, 3 weeks after losing it, I got another email. The Hotel Manger considered that there was a risk of fraud here so they would not return the item unless I sent a fax with a scan of my credit card and a scan of my passport or other photo id. It had by now taken them 3 weeks to decide this and I don't have a fax machine.I called the hotel and pointed out that I was a customer, had stayed there, the property was found in my room, they had swiped my credit card while I was there and I lived in the UK at the address they would post the item to and that was the address on my registration. No dice. Without the fax the item wouldnt be posted back. I was clearly being treated as a suspected crook who was trying to defraud them in some way although how I could do this when they were charging my credit card for the cost of postage I cannot understand.Frankly after this I wouldn't send what is in effect a DIY identity fraud kit to this hotel. I don't trust them. This item is worth perhaps 100 but they can keep it. will never stay there again and Radission should be ashamed of this.My advice is clear. This hotel is OK and reasonable value ....... but don't stay there."
52,1084,"Jan 10 2009 	Great Location	Have to agree with other reviewer's this is very well located if you want a base for shopping or have business locally, although I had read reviews I was still a little shocked at the small size of the room especially for the price and would be a problem of storage if you arrive with 2 suitcases. The room small, AC/heating noisy, hairdryer did not work but one was immediately brought up (it is my opinion when paying high price to stay in a quality hotel it should not be up to the guests to find out things don't work?), the bathroom was cold with no heating but liked the large shower done tiled like a turkish bath area but found the tiled/marbled seat very very cold because no heating. Tea/coffee hidden away in cupboard (no biccies) bit of a pain to use kettle to make a drink. Iron &amp; ironing board provided in room - nice touch. Food/breakfast ok. Staff friendly and welcoming. A tip for anyone going to this hotel for the first time it is located between Debenhams &amp; Mexx stores down the street, took me 40 mins to find it after I came out of Bond St underground as there are no signs, would not even contemplate driving to or parking around this hotel?"
53,1084,"Dec 22 2008 	Loved it!	Great location - In the heart of Oxford Street-Bond St Tube Station a minutes walk away - Ideal for shopping and transport links.The hotel , staff , rooms and service were first class and can't fault anything about our stay and would certainly come back to stay there again 5 Stars from me!"
54,1084,Nov 25 2008 	Great location	We stayed at this hotel to go Christmas shopping. It is a great hotel right on Oxford St. which is perfect for shopping.We had two executive twin rooms. Good rooms and bathrooms with nice smellies.I would always stay here if I want to go shopping again.
55,1084,"Nov 3 2008 	Great location and tiny room	I stayed at Radisson Edwardian Berkshire Hotel in the end of October 2008 in connection with a short business trip to London. I booked the hotel in advance and paid 188 GBP. When I arrived, the check in was very fast and I was assigned to room 801 which was on the top floor When I first came into the room I found a small room but I was prepared for this based on the reviews that I have read in advance. But the room itself was quite nice and seemed very organized and tidy at first glance. On the floor there was a rough carpet and the walls were in light colours. I had a queen size bed, a small table and chair, a wardrobe and a centrepiece containing the Bang Olufsen TV on top of a minibar and safe. The furniture was in dark wood and it made quite a slick contrast to the carpet and the walls. The bed was not bad at all but I would have preferred a proper duvet as I was freezing all night long when I stayed there. I discovered that there was a tiny temperature controller by the door.but I only found that the next morning.The bathroom had dark tiles on the floor and light tiles on the walls. The bathroom furniture was quite modern so I think it must have been refurbished not too many years ago. There were not that many amenities by the way: dispensers with soap and lotion, shower cap and shampoo in the shower. The bathroom was quite cold as there were no heating in the floor so the big mirror fogged up after taking a shower. It was not that easy controlling the temperature of the water in the shower either and it felt like it varied every time someone used water in any of the other rooms. But the shower was great with a proper glass door to avoid water splashing.The location of the hotel is great. Once you step out of the door you are basically seconds away from Oxford street and right across the street was Bond underground station.The breakfast buffet was also very nice. There was a nice selection of egg, bacon, sausages etc. ConclusionRadisson Edwardian Berkshire Hotel was not bad at all. The location is excellent and the rooms are modern. The rooms are tiny but what more do you need if you are only there for a night ? As usual the internet was free and that is always a plus when you are on a business trip."
56,1084,"Aug 9 2008 	Good location	Great location just on Oxford Street opposite Bond St tube station. 3 mins from Selfridges and grosvenor square.Problems were a/c didnt work the first night and as you cant open the windows due to the noise we didnt get to sleep. Also the fire bells went off twice for just enough time to get you dressed then went off.], at about 2-3 in the am. :(The rooms were small but well appointed and it really is a very good location, but you do need ear plugs. staff were helpful and shifted us for the second night, however concierge mentioned they get complaints that its too hot in summer and too cold in winter. With all that I'd stay again with decent ear plugs."
57,1084,"Aug 4 2008	Great shopping location small rooms	This hotel has a great location on a side street of Oxford Street, next to Debenhams, and 30 seconds from Bond Street tube station. However, the hotel and rooms feel small and cramped, with a reception area smaller than my living room, tiny lifts and small rooms. My standard room contained a double bed and a small round glass table under the wall-mounted tv, and that is it - not even room for a chair, so if you need to use the computer (free wifi is available) you have to perch on the end of the bed. I liked having the free wifi though - nice touch as too often hotels charge for this. The rooms were fairly stylish and fairly recently refurbished, so no complaints there. It can be a bit noisy at night, though to be expected due to its location. Overall, I would recommend if you require a convenient location and not much else from the hotel."
58,1084,"Jul 21 2008 	So so	This hotel is right on oxford street which makes for a great location. people seem to have problems with noise they think that will wake them up if they are facing oxford st but i was there 2 weeks ago and our room was right facing the street and when the windows are closed u hear nothing. Also at night the street is lyk a movie set it's completley bare so that's good.It's right next to all the good shops obviously and directly across from the tube station. Buses are also always there but getting a taxi on oxford st is nearly impossible. They avoid it unless they're customers wanna go there in which case they're fulll.Back to the hotel - at check in we moved rooms 3 times. Firstly i am from a family of five and we needed a room for 3 and a room for 2. We had specified a room for 3 but didn't find it in the first room as tehre was only one double bed. We didn't find it in the second room as tehre were 2 single beds so we had to go back to the first room, pull an extra duffle bed in and someone slept on the floor. That was dissapointing.The breakfast is nice - it has everything you need. Hot food and continental but the coffee is the worst thing in the world. Beware of the bar by the way that's on the ground floor next to reception - 4 pounds for a glass of water? i think not."
59,1084,"Jul 16 2008 	great location decent accomodation	The Berkshire is one of few Radissons located quite centrally around Oxford Street, all quite close to each other. The location of this one is possibly the best, located practically on Oxford St., about a hundred meters from Bond Street station and a lot of excellent shopping locations. The lobby of the hotel is quite small, as was the room, which according to the receptionist was a deluxe room which we were &quot;upgraded&quot; to. I'm quite sure they didnt have any basic rooms left as I've heard of several stories where these Radissons have run out of rooms. anyway, I didnt mind the upgrade, the room was definately liveable and still certainly not the smallest in London.I was a bit worried about noise, so I was delighted to see a modern double window in our room which indirectly faced Oxford St. to my surprise though, the other of two windows was missing the additionalm thicker layer, meaning everything from the street was quite audible in the room. I'm not sure if the second window was broken or what, but it being the one next to the bed meant that earplugs came in handy.that was however the only complaint I have, otherwise I enjoyed the stay here and was more than happy with the location. well, only other thing I'd mention is the sliding glass door on the toilet, this fad many hotels seem to buy is just ridicilous. it benefits no one, really. the price I guess is what you need to pay in London, anything cheaper most of the time shows an obvious decline in quality as well,another option worth considering is the Radisson Sussex located behind Selfridges. perhaps a bit more spacious and slightly more slick."
60,1084,"Jul 11 2008 	Great location room could use help	I just spent 3 nights at this hotel and was somewhat disappointed, but gradually grew to like it. The negatives: I booked the Business package on the website which includes internet and breakfast and is supposed to be a deluxe room. I requested a room away from Oxford Street that was quiet. They put me in 217 which is a low floor as I arrived at noon rather than their check-in time of 2 pm and it overlooked Oxford Street. It was noisy and emergency vehicles could be heard. There is no air conditioning, yet it was summer and quite warm, but they did bring a fan which helped. The furnishings - especially the mattress are tired and should be replaced. The decor could use a fake plant or something to soften it.The positives: Some of the staff were quite helpful. One evening, I brought back a curry from a farmer's market and the young man at the front desk kindly heated it up for me and served it in my room with dinnerware. The location is awesome! If you have limited time in London and want to get in quick shopping and the theatre this is so convenient.Will I go back? Hmmm - depends on if I can afford something nicer. I would have preferred a boutique hotel, but if I want to save money and have limited time I would consider staying there again."
61,1084,"Jun 5 2008 	Great location	In general, we enjoyed our 4 -nights stay at this hotel. The location could not be better for transportation and shopping. Rooms are small, but confortable and very clean.Be aware when booking through the hotel's web site: it does not offer the choice &quot;smoking or non-smoking room&quot;. You have to ask for a non-smoking room as a special written request. As we are used to other web sites, where the choice appears in the first place, we did not made the request. When we arrived to the hotel, late in the evening, the clerck told us that &quot;as you did not ask for a non-smoking room, I have to give you the only room left&quot; and it was a little smoking room on the first floor. We felt cheated. If we had noticed that detail....!! We think the web site is prepared that way to give the hotel more flexibility, but that is not fair to the clients. Next day we got a non smoking room, but no discount or breakfast free; nothing apart of the apology of the clerk."
62,1084,"May 27 2008 	Rather disappointing...	Had a Sunday afternoon flight from Gatwick and decided to treat myself to a nice night out in London the evening before...booked my room at this hotel through Lastminute.com at a fairly hefty discount. If I'd paid the full rate, I'd have been fairly displeased with what I got, but even at the discounted price I'd have to say this place was nothing really special. The only things going for it were the superb location and the fact that I could smoke in my room - something I thought government Nazis had outlawed everywhere!. Aside from that, there was the empty shampoo packet left in the shower by a previous guest (something one doesn't expect in a 4 star hotel!)...the rather meagre tea and coffee supplies(if you want more than one container of milk in your hot drink, that's the only drink you'll get, because the hotel provides two containers of UHT milk and that's it!)...and the completely outrageous food prices (20 including tray charge for a continental breakfast, whereas a hotel of a similiar standard that I stayed in recently offers a full hot buffet AND Continental breakfast for two pounds less). The list thoughtfully provided to give guests costs of items in the room in case they decided to make off with them was really the final straw - next time I'm in London, I'll spend half what I spent last weekend and stay in a hotel that really knows the meaning of customer service!"
63,1084,"May 11 2008 	Excellent location to Oxford Street but terrible check-in	Stayed at this hotel as part of a theatre break weekend. The hotel's entrance is situated just off Oxford Street, the ocation cannot be beaten for access to the shops! Check-in was terrible, our room was not ready when we arrived (1pmi-sh) and was told it would be ready at 2:30pm - went for some lunch, returned and still not ready - this continued for the next hour, each time I spoke to someone different and was told only 10 more minutes........1 hour later someone finally took onus of the situation and we were finally let into our room!!Rooms were nice, lovely decor, quite spacious and had a lovely bathroom - not much of a view though. We received a complimentary newspaper each day and the breakfast was self-service and delicious. The staff at breakfast time were very attentive but staff at reception seemed a little vacant at times. They also had very little knowledge of the local area."
64,1084,"May 1 2008 	stolen	I stayed at this Hotel for 3 nights..early check-in was allowed without extra charge.. this was good~but when I check mini bar, there's some missing bottles..so I noticed to the front desk right away.. not to charge me.also house keeper took my cell phone charger away on last day. and my cell phone was running out of battery..( it was my business trip... )"
65,1084,Mar 26 2008 	Perfect Hotel for Weekend Getaway	Great location and a great hotel. Stayed in a deluxe room which was roomy and had an amazing bathroom. Would def stay again.
66,1084,"Jan 30 2008 	Good Location for Oxford Street Shopping	Stayed here for 4 nights in early January 2008. Booked a deluxe room through the hotel's web site. Daily breakfast and newspaper are included in the package but newspaper was delivered to my room only 2 out of the 4 nights. Although the address is 350 Oxford Street, hotel entrance is actually on a dead-end side street off Oxford Street and is not well lit at night. If returning to hotel by taxi, it involved a &quot;diversion/detour&quot; before it can get there or ask the driver to drop you off on Oxford Street o/s Debenham for a quick short walk. Checked in online in advance but it did not expedite the check in process on arrival. The lobby is small and no staff was on hand to assist with baggage. Hotel staff were otherwise friendly and helpful. Breakfast selections were okay but did not eat at the hotel otherwise for lunch or dinner. My room faces Oxford Street but the window noise insulation was quite good and was not bothersome except for the occasional emergency vehicle siren. The hotel is just off Oxford Street across from the Bond tube station. Excellent location for shopping and access to transportation. The overall condition of the hotel and my room are good except for the mattresses and sofa in my room were near the end of their useful life. Housekeeping was good."
67,1084,"Dec 4 2007	Style over substance	Stayed here about 18 months ago in a small room with a small bed so have avoided and tried to stay in hotels at a similar price where you can walk round the bed and get a bath. Was booked here last week and thought I'd try it again, specifically asking for a bath through the agent - when I got there spent 5 minutes whilst this request was considered, discussed with the other receptionist and then the manager. I was then told that they were graciously upgrading me to what I would get for the price at many other hotels in the area. The room was noisy as it was at the Oxford Street end, the bathroom noisier and the cold blast from the window over the bath unpleasant. A triumph of style over substance. Would go again if the only alternative was the Sussex!"
68,1084,Nov 27 2007 	What is there not to like? Its just great	This is now my favorite hotel in London. The location is great for shopping. There are a lot of little things that are to my liking. The bathrooms have plenty of shelves for cosmetics and they have Q-tips and cotton wool balls! There is wireless internet included and the breakfast was good. The staff were extremely helpful also.We had our 18 year old daughter and her boyfriend with us and both rooms were roomy and comfortable.We also had dinner in their restaurant and it was excellent.I will definetly stay there again.
69,1084,"Oct 7 2007 	Horrible hotel well situated	Horrible dark and dingy hotel with peeling wallpaper, scummy bathtubs, rotten carpets and an awful smell !! Two room changes. No difference.And I forgot the building works. Drilling from 8 in the morning.Absolutely shocking. I will never stay in a Radisson group hotel again."
70,1084,"Sep 22 2007 	Wonderful week	First the &quot;bad&quot;: The room itself was a culture shock. Extremely small for the price. Amenities are rather lacking and the bed was small by American standards.The &quot;good&quot; far outweighed the size of the room: The hotel is extremely well maintained and spotlessly clean. Service was excellent.The staff could give lessons to their counterparts in America.They are extremely polite, very helpful, and most importantly, very friendly. The concierge personnel went out of their way to help me navigate the city, explained the Tube system to me, and mapped out paths for me to follow to the various sites I wished to see. I walked most of London and when I'd return to the hotel, the lounge staff would make sure I was okay and then leave me alone until I raised an eyebrow or looked their way and then brought me a cup of tea or coffee. (If you are American, drink the tea. British coffee is terrible.)Just an aside, I asked the concierge about a particular restaurant and was told not to eat there because I wouldn't enjoy a &quot;British&quot; steak. Instead a Tuscan restaurant (almost everything is now Italian around Oxford street) named Caldesi was recommended. It is approximately 4-6 minutes from the hotel on foot. The food is superb and the cappuccino was the best coffee I had while in England.All in all, the staff of the hotel made my trip to London a very wonderful experience and was well worth the cost. I am ashamed to say I didn't write down the names of the staff. I can't say enough about what a wonderful experience they made my trip. I can only recall a young lady named Barbara who served in both the restaurant and lounge. Her attention to my needs was terrific.Finally, Londoners are a great people. Friendly and extremely willing to help you find your way about. Especially if you have a southern American accent. (tongue in cheek.)Richard Palmedo"
71,1084,"Sep 18 2007	Fantastic Location!	We stayed here for one night and were very pleased. The hotel is situated right on Oxford Street and is perfect for shopping! The hotel itself is spotless, the room was well furnished and had everying thing you would need for a comfortable stay. The only thing I would say is that the air con. is quite noisy at night. Breakfast was excellent with something for everyone. Only a stone's throw from two tube stations, and very reasonably priced - we would definitely return again due to its central location. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We were able to leave our bags at the hotel for a few hours after checking out with no charge."
72,1084,"Aug 30 2007 	Excellent Service	I won a 5 night trip to London and was placed here by the agency handling the arrangements. My family of 3 couldn't have been happier. We all agreed this hotel offered the best service of any hotel we've stayed in. The staff was very accommodating and kind. The room was lovely and although Oxford Street is bustling and we could see it from our window there was very little noise and had no problem sleeping. The beautiful marble bathroom was a nice size. We didn't eat in Ascots but did enjoy the bar menu. The included breakfast was also very nice and offered a wide variety. We were very, very pleased with our stay."
73,1084,"Aug 29 2007	Not Good	Not a great experience. I had a room you'd be hard pressed to swing half a cat in. The TV didn't work properly. Radio 4 was completely inaudible. Air con was loud. Thankfully, I wasn't paying, but if I had been then my complaints would have been long and loud.Staff were perfectly nice, but on my experience I'd avoid it if you can.David"
74,1084,"Aug 2 2007 	Perfect location for shopping!!	Every year I go on a mini break to London with my mum. This year we chose the Berkshire Hotel. What a find!!You really cannot find a better location for shopping on Oxford Street. Handy if you intend to purhcase alot as you can simply drop your bags off in your room and head out again.The breakfast was of a high quality with plenty of choice. The rooms were decorated to a high spec, very modern. Only downside was that we didn't have a bath, but did have a double shower. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.Security is good as you need to insert your room key to gain access to residental floor in the lift and stairs.All in all we had a wonderful 4 days staying at the Berksire Hotel in Oxford Street and would recommend it to anyone!"
75,1084,"Jun 28 2007 	excellent experience	I enjoyed the hospitality of the Radisson Berkshire for 4 nights in early May. Travelling solo I only needed a single room which , whilst on the small side provided a very comfortable double bed well appointed bathroom and a good quality televison. Staff were very welcoming at check in and check out. I greatly enjoyed a traditional english breakfast of the highest quality in the hotel's breakfast room which also had a lovely traditional ambience.Location is sensational , next door to debenhams and metres away from the Bond street tube entrance. However being right on Bond street you can hear the street noise if you are in a room close to the front of the building. Daily newspapers and free internet access in their computer room were welcome bonuses. highly recommended hotel."
76,1084,"Jun 15 2007 	great location	We stayed here last weekend for our fifth anniversary, and booked it though lastminute.com under 'top secret hotels' - what a great deal! The location is fabulous, you walk out of Bond Street tube station and the hotel is right in front of you.The decor is very stylish and comfortable. Rooms are on the small side, but if you are staying a long time in your room then shame on you - its London! We stayed on a room only basis so can't comment on the breakfast.Down side to the hotel is the noise, being right on Oxford Street you can hear the traffic and the beeping of the pedestrian crossing.Overall, if you're looking for a chic hotel that is a great base to explore London this is the right hotel for you."
77,1084,"Jun 13 2007 	Great location for shopping	If you intend to do some shopping, then this location is perfect. The rooms are small but so very comfy. There are computer terminals for free internet access (husband surfed the web, while I shopped). The bar is nice in the evening. I would only stay at the hotel if you have already been to London before or are there for several days. If you are only there for 1-4 days, I would pick a hotel closer to Westminster where all the tourist sights are. But don't think you'll get away from the tourists at this hotel either. Oxford Street is very busy. There are lots of side streets to explore. Many dining and bar choices as well all around. There are also a lot of pedestrian only streets for shopping and eating nearby.."
78,1084,Jun 2 2007 	Excellent location	Ideal location ....However the hotel isn't particularly good. Nothing to feel amused or let down. The service is ok....It is quite a small hotel...particularly the reception area without a lounge area.
79,1084,Apr 10 2007 	Smart Hotel close to shops 	Booked this hotel as going to see a show in the Palladium Threatre (7 mins walk away). Ideally close to Oxford Street - hotel entrance on side street right beside Debenhams which proved to be a good landmark when wanting to return to hotel. We had booked a twin-bed deluxe room which although not big was spotlessly clean with lovely bathroom. We overlooked Oxford Street (Room 519) which could have been noisy if you opened the windows but the air conditioning worked fine. Breakfast was a hot &amp; cold buffet and staff pleasant. We booked via the hotel chain online and had no problems with our booking - receiving a welcoming e-mail one week before travel. From previous experience of hotel chains in London you should always try to book the best room you can afford as the quality is always less in London. Have no complaints regarding this one. It is right beside Bond St tube station with easy links to other attractions. Staff helpful and kept our cases even after we had checked out so that we could go shopping.
80,1084,"Jan 2 2007 	Great service Convenient spot for shopping	We stayed at this hotel in December after Christmas with another couple. We had two rooms there on the same floor. Our stay in London was strictly a shopping trip during the big sale in London after xmas. The location is awesome. We mainly shop at Selfridges and along New and Old Bond Streets. All within walking distance from the hotel. The staff has been very helpful. They helped us arrange tables at nice restaurants, even at New Year's Eve. Very nice and modern decor in the rooms. Very good value for the money for a nice room in the center of West end London. We are definitely coming back in our next shopping trip to London."
81,1084,"Dec 21 2006	Noisy and cold - never again!	My boyfriend and I stayed here after my office Christmas party this week. The hotel is in a great location, right in the West End and hence I also understand that there will be a certain amount of noise from outside. However, I didn't bargain for the beeps of a pedestrian crossing going off approximately every 10 seconds from the first light of dawn. On closer inspection of the window, it was only half double glazed which would also explain the icy winds coming in on the coldest night of the year so far!Our mood wasn't improved by the breakfast delivered to our room - on time, but freezing cold and shrivelled up - totally inedible.I expected more from Radisson, having stayed at other hotels in their group and been pleased with the accommodation there. Never again for the Berkshire!"
82,1084,"Dec 13 2006 	Very disappointing	I had what I experienced as a nightmare of a stay at this hotel as from Dec 8th until Dec 11th.I booked by Internet, and was sent some welcoming reminders from the hotel with weather forecasts etc. before going. I had great expectations, and had a booked a &quot;Let Loose In London&quot; offer in a deluxe room, and I also had great memories of the hotel after staying there a couple of years ago.The offer was described as including the following:Accommodation Full English breakfast VAT at 17.5% Let Loose voucher booklet given upon arrival. Pass is full of exclusive London offers from The Comedy Store, Natural History Museum, Vinopolis City of Wine, Victoria and Albert Museum and many more The DeLuxe room was described as containing:Deluxe roomsKing or twin deluxe bedrooms are more spacious than standard bedrooms, with a king size bed or two single beds. Deluxe rooms also offer a seating area with a sofa or chaise lounge, turn down service and bathrobes and slippers.I was given a small and most standard and poor room, I never obtained any voucher booklet during my stay and I was even told in the breakfast room the first morning that breakfast was not included. When I asked a lady in the recpetion about this and told her that I was on the Let Loose In London offer, she reluctantly wrote in the system that I was supposed to have breakfast inclusive. (Nevertheless the breakfast appeared with a charge on my bill when I checked out, but I refused to pay it and it was deleted). Nothing else happened, and as I had not printed what the offer included I became uncertain of what was in the package and let go with the treatment they gave me.I will also mention the disappointment in finding the room undone when I returned in the afternoon (I had turned on the green light for &quot;Please clean the room&quot; when leaving in the morning), and that I had to ask them to refill the minibar after it had not been done for two following days.A most disappointing experience, and they broke all my expectations of a comfortable and nice London stay.Let me add that I have written a complaint to them after returning home and having found the scope of the offer, as well as a complaint to the chanin's customer service department. It will be interesting to see of they care enough to give me a response...."
83,1084,"Oct 29 2006 	Great Hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 1 night as part of a theatre break in London.Although it was a little small, the room was clean and very quiet. We had arrived earlier than the stated check in time and the hotel took our bags, so that we could go and enjoy the shopping delights of Oxford Street!Our rate didn't include breakfast, however this was available for an additional 16 each. Personally, I wouldn't bother, as there are several Starbucks or cafe's around within a few minutes walking distance.A great hotel in a fantastic location, especially if you would like to be close to all the shops and directly opposite the tube station (Bond Street).The only negative was the bathroom was very small (but clean), however, for a few nights stay ie a weekend trip, it is adequate enough.Would stay here again and reccomend it to others."
84,1084,"Jul 20 2006	Great Hotel	Just got back from staying at the Radisson Edwardian. Was a little apprehensive about staying here after reading the other reviews but was pleasantly surprised.The hotel is very stylish, staff very friendly, the room not too small (standard) but very upto the minute, clean and facing a side street so not too noisy. The bathroom is really modern. The bed and pillows are very very comfortable. The only slightly negative points are the lack of two bedside tables (there was one on one side) and clock, also the marble floor in the bathroom is very slippy went wet. Having said this, the location is perfect, the bar is trendy (but expensive) and the restaurant is worth a visit. Will stay here again the future."
85,1084,"Jul 12 2006 	London Hotel Surprising	Stayed for one night on business in June 2006.Nice enough hotel if very expensive. I expect less from London hotels than anywhere else in the country, as such this was a good hotel. Room was small but ideal for one person.Caters for tourists in my opinion rather than business.Great location as over road from the tube."
86,1084,"Jul 3 2006	Confirmed 	Our reservations were confirmed and PAID FOR two weeks ahead of time, but this didn't matter. The Radisson overbooked and then shuttled customers to other Radissons in the London area. There were no comps for this inconvenience, no coupons, nothing except a weak &quot;I apologize.&quot; The Radisson hailed a taxi to take us to the other hotel. The taxi driver told us he had been shuttling customers between the various London Radissons all day. Evidently this is a well know fact in the London area. DO NOT STAY AT THIS OR ANY OTHER RADISSON IN LONDON. They are all participating in this unethical, but not illegal activity. Forget that the customer selected a particular Radisson for it's location, or past experience, or a friend's recommendation. None of this matters to the Radisson organization. Remember when you book with Radisson in London, you know not where you will actually be staying. From a business view, I understand how this happend. I had booked a Saturday night only because we were traveling from Edinburgh to London and then flying home the following day. It was the Queen's birthday weekend, the weather was beautiful and there were other special activities in the city. I was knocked to the &quot;unimportant&quot; category because they had several reservations for Thursday-Saturday night. This is exactly why a person pays ahead and has a confirmed reservation.I have never written a review, but this situation was so unacceptable that I had to tell others."
87,1084,May 30 2006	Fab hotelfab location	We stayed at this lovely hotel located right off of oxford street after a freinds wedding in town.The hotel has been completley re-furbished with lovely marble bathrooms &amp; one of the best nights sleep I've ever had.The staff were also extremely friendly which made a pleasent change.Highly recommended &amp; fab location especially for tourists.
88,1084,"Mar 28 2006	Not to be recommended	We stayed at this hotel yesterday for one night only and were not impressed. Ridiculously small reception area, no public rooms to relax, tiny lifts and even smaller bedrooms! You cannot swing a cat in them. This combined with appalling room lighting (non-existent or &quot;full prison compound&quot;), a tiny, poorly equipped bathroom and it's noise levels due to proximity to Oxford Street make it a hotel not to be recommended.TW, Coventry, England"
89,1084,"Mar 14 2006	Disappointing!	Booked last minute for an annisversary, stated that it was a 4* deluxe. first impression, great location for shops and tube.Hotel itself,our king deluxe room was fairly standard, it had an overpowering smell of fresh paint.So we asked to be moved. Which they did! Eventually got a room that was of similar size to the one was had paid for, but the previous guest had left a little suprise inside the toilet! We were reliably informed by reception upon informing them,that his name was Mr Bennett!! However, we were offered two free breakfasts, which are not worth paying for! The following morning, we were woken up by workmen in the room next door at 8am. There were no robes/slippers in the room and the free paper didnt arrive! On the whole disappointing, not worth the 145 paid for it!"
90,1084,"Jan 26 2006	Extremely Average for a Radisson	Location for this hotel on Oxford St is excellent, also being close the the Bond St Tube. Service from the staff is at best poor, with them often being rude. Rooms are clean and recently refurbished. Lifts are a nuisance, being small and often out of service. Rooms can be noisy, particularly on the higher floors."
91,1084,"Dec 30 2005	Disappointed On The Whole	Hotel location was perfect for the purpose of our visit (sales shopping) and well connected with Bond Street Underground directly opposite. On the whole the hotel is very small, room/bar/restaurant and the service was poor to average (especially in the bar). The hotel has 2 lifts (again very small 4 person capacity) one of which was broke for the majority of our stay resulting in taking the stairs to the 6th floor on several occasions. Having stayed at other Radisson Hotels we were disappointed."
92,1084,"Dec 8 2005	bad Radisson no cookie.	I stayed at the Radisson edwardian Berkshire thinking I would be safe with their Radisson Edwardian brand name. I have since reavaluated this thinking after staying here. It was not at all what I was expecting or hoping for.The only advice I can give you if you're planning to stay at the Radisson Edwardian Berkshire,- Look closely in the rooms to make sure that it has actually been cleaned.- Bring your own soap for the shower, I wouldn't recommend a bath.- Avoid the breakfast. It costs a fortune and is a monumental disappointment. save your money and eat at a caf instead.- Speak slowly and clearly to the staff.- Don't look at the Radisson Edwardian's website beforehand.I'll be staying elsewhere next time."
93,1084,"Nov 17 2005	Good location but noisy and rooms are cramped bathrooms are tiny	I would be inclined to avoid the Berkshire on Oxford St again. (it's actually just off Oxford St on a little side-passage, officially called &quot;Marylebone Lane&quot;, which quite a few taxi drivers don't seem to have heard of.) The standard rooms are minute, with positively microscopic bathrooms. &quot;Deluxe&quot; rooms are quite nice with decent (soft-ish) beds, and tiny cramped bathrooms. Several annoyances include bath taps that can only be turned off by standing up in a slippery and somewhat dangerous manner, a tiny kettle to match the tiny rooms and round-the-clock loud vehicle and people noise from Oxford St. The staff are friendly but sometimes too helpful, insisting on hassling you for hours afterwards in their determination to &quot;deal&quot; with small complaints. The usual language problems apply, with concierges and restaraunt staff showing a limited grasp of English in some cases. Nearby car park is phenomenally expensive and nearby car parking spaces relentlessly patrolled by zealous central London warders. Great location but not particularly pleasant hotel for the price."
94,1084,"Oct 27 2005	Recommended.	My parents come down to London once a month and I put them in a different place almost everytime - just so I can see the state of London hotels!I managed to book a superior room via Lastminute for 125 (it was a secret hotel but with some investigation it was easy to work out).The hotel looks freshly refurbished and rooms were fantastic. I noticed that some people complain about the space, but any room which can include a sofa and a coffee table does well in my book - especially for London (and being British I'm used to small rooms).The ground floor bar was ok, although the waiter had a serve shortage of champagne glasses (not very proffesional)! I put my head into the first floor bar/restaurant and both were desserted (Friday night) - I don't think this is a major problem as the location next to Oxford street is excellent for food/drink/shopping.Overall recommended."
95,1084,"Oct 19 2005	Everything on your doorstep!	I stayed here for two nights in October; one on my own and the second with my man. For anyone booking a hotel in London for the first time, there is no such thing as cheap and cheerful. I got a great last minute rate of 119 plus VAT on londontown (the rooms are usually over 200) Even the dumpy 3 stars out in the suburbs are about 80, so I figured this was a good deal..The best thing about this hotel is location! It's literally on Oxford St, so for anyone interested in shopping, it's a great base, as it means you can pop back to the hotel several times a day to drop off any heavy bags, or just to have a nap or rest. Selfridges is 3 minutes walk away and the hotel is right next door to Debenhams. As I was on my own for the first night, I was glad that I could head out for a casual meal with my book, and stroll home safely on my own, without the worry of scary tube stations or dimly lit laneways out of town. The hotel is right beside some really nice (and really expensive!!) bars and restaurants, and also 100m from Bond St tube station, so it's the perfect city break location. The rooms are pretty small and a little noisy, but hey that's what you get when you stay in central London. Very modern coffee and cream decor, spotlessly clean linen, towels and sparkling bathroom, and of course yummy fluffy robes, minibar, and tea and coffee. The lobby is small, as is the bar, but it is quiet and discreet, and a nice oasis of calm after the hustle and bustle of Oxford St. Can't vouch for the restaurant as I ate out all the time. London rocks!!"
96,1084,Sep 22 2005	TINY rooms even the deluxe - not like photos	Arrived midnight and checked out 1/2 hour later! After research I had settled on the berkshire as budget luxury. Knew the rooms were small after research but booked a deluxe thinking it would be bigger. It was a surprisingly hot still day and the room was so hot and stuffy found out quickly the a/c was broken opening the windows mad no difference was noisy and still. was informed there was no more rooms to switch us to that night but we couldn't have stayed in that hot room. was very disappointed to find out how poky and tiny it was. was lucky another hotel had a room and checked out.
97,1084,"Aug 2 2005 	Clean Room Consistent with Radissons	The Radisson Berkshire is in a grrrrreat location. It's very close to Oxford Circle and it's shopping GALORE around the area. Additionally, it's a short walk to Bond Street for great eats and ... more shopping.I stayed at the Radisson for business since our office is nearby. It was really convenient to be able to walk to work, go shopping after work, meet up with colleagues to get cocktails/dinner nearby, and then head to the bars.The food at the hotel was &quot;o.k.&quot; Don't expect much, and you won't be disappointed. Bathrooms were clean (as always, which is really nice about the Radisson), and the people at the front desk were relatively helpful. I think Americans expect their &quot;deluxe&quot; rooms to be pretty large, and if you haven't been to London before, don't expect that. Expect your &quot;deluxe&quot; room to be S M A L L. But, try not to complain about that because does it really matter? You should be out on the town anyway, especially since the hotel is in such a great location. (Well, except the K-West hotel which was a pretty large &quot;deluxe&quot; room, except that it's FAR from central london)For business, the hotel is PERFECT. Getting Internet access was a breeze, and I never had connectivity problems (see my review of the K-West hotel)."
98,1084,"Jun 5 2005	Fab city hotel	Just came back from a weekend at this hotel - we were booked into a Delux twin room - beds were so comfortably, large sofa, huge TV, mini bar, marble bathroom with shower/bath, shower very powerful, luxery toiletries, bath robes, very good powerful hair dryer (a must for the ladies), tea and coffee, iron and ironing board. The room was fairly large and no noise from next door rooms. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel decor is very modern and classic. The hotel is ideal for shopping on Oxford Street, Regent Street and close to some fab resturants on the Edgware Road. I would highly recommend this hotel and I will definatly stay here again."
99,1084,May 30 2005	what a great place!	I had a superb experience at this hotel. The (deluxe) twin room I booked was reasonably roomy with extremely comfortable beds and a decent sitting area.The bathroom was gorgeous. No bath but a huge shower with three different showerheads! All gorgeously marble and very clean. Good wardrobe space. Minibar was pretty useless but it was really cold (how often does that happen?!) so restock it to your spec!The common areas throughout the hotel were very stylish and well maintained and the staff were very friendly and helpful - check in took about 30 seconds!The location is what really sets is apart though. It is footsteps away from the main part of Oxford Street. Perfect for shopping and also perfect to stagger back from Soho after a night out.Compared to the other hotels in the area it is very reasonably priced. I highly recommend it and will be staying here again.
100,1084,"Apr 20 2005	Be careful with the Radisson Hotels.	We were booked by our travel agent into the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt in the Kensington areain late March over the Easter holiday. We arrived late, after a snafu at the airport, only to find that our rooms were gone. We were taken by a private hire car paid for by the Radisson to another Radisson hotel, which was a little more Euro-chic than we had planned upon. The second hotel, the Radisson Berkshire on Oxford Street, was clean and nice, but the room provided was minuscule. We were able to be moved to another, slightly larger room with the beds that we had requested the following night. The staff was excellent, but there was confusion over the breakfast (we had pre-paid, but had to sign on a daily basis for the breakfast, to the tune of 30 pounds per person!), and the Radisson Vanderbilt did not forward to us a fax from our &quot;meet and greet&quot; service that we really should have been sent. When we checked out, there was confusion about the payment. We had paid for all expenses in advance, but received a bill for the total amount of our stay, including the outrageously overpriced breakfasts. It took a while to straighten it all out, as everything had to be checked with the Radisson Vanderbilt. The location of the Berkshire Radisson was great- in the middle of the shopping on Oxford Street, close to the bus stops and tube, and there was a cash machine right around the corner. We did enjoy the staff, who really went out of their way to try to make things right. All in all, we had a good time, but if we were to stay there again, we would confirm things ourselves, instead of letting the travel agent do it. We would call the hotel from the airport immediately upon arrival to be certain that the rooms were as promised. Nice place to stay, but check things out carefully."
101,1084,"Feb 13 2005	Hang Onto Your Shoes!	I spent one night at this hotel with a friend who had invited me to join her for her graduation ceremony in the City.  THE PROS I booked it through airmiles. I presumed I was entering a hotel which would take me back to a time of luxury, opulence and good service and I felt pleased it wasn't costing me much!  I must admit the hotel itself was excellent. Check-in was speedy and efficient. Our room was spacious and it was obvious the rooms and bathrooms had been refurbished. We went out for a meal and by the time we returned, the receptionist had left a voice-mail on our phone asking whether everything was ok and to please let her know if anything was not.   THE CONS We were given luxury bathrobes and slippers but were horrified when one bathrobe was absolutely filthy! A previous occupant of our room had obviously been ill and I have no intenion of putting into words what the robe was covered with. Needless to say, we rang down and asked for a replacement. We had to ring again half an hour later as no-one had acted on our request.   As the Radisson Edwardian group pride themselves in giving service second to none, this was not the sort of problem we expected from a hotel of this class. The fact that it was not acted upon speedily after our first phone call also disappointed us greatly! Indeed, we were left questionnaires in the bedroom and at our breakfast table, inviting our comments and suggestions for any improvements we felt they could make. Needless to say, I filled it in!  The reference to hanging onto your shoes was the final straw when we put our shoes out for a free clean. They advertise that if shoes are placed outside the room by 1.00am, they will be returned clean by 6.00am. We took advantage of this but by the time we wanted to go for breakfast, our shoes were still missing! We had to ring again for our shoes to be returned!  By this time, we felt we had done nothing but complain but the experience we encountered at this 4*deluxe hotel was not what we were expecting.  We might well have just been unlucky as all other aspects of our stay were excellent. However, it doesn't make me want to return to the Berkshire even though the location was fantastic!"
102,1084,"Feb 11 2005	Rip Off	I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in Feb. 2005 and was paying about 150 british pounds a night. The room was soooooooooooooo small and so was the bathroom. There was only space for the bed and nothing else. I was staying in a double deluxe room. The bathroom is very average. from reading the description of the hotel, one would think it was something nice. Generally, the staff were very cold, with the exeption of very few.   One night I wanted to order roomservice late and they are supposedly doing that 24 hours but everything we asked for, they said, &quot;No, we don't do that&quot;. I even asked for a diet coke and he told me, &quot;No, sorry we don't do that.&quot; In the end we settled for cheese sandwiches, cold cuz they said they also don't toast the bread and got charged 15 pounds for it. This hotel is expensive for nothing.   On checkout, they tried to charge me an additional 20 pounds and I had to prove I owed nothing else. There was no apology. The windows in my room were broken. Instead of being able to open from the bottom upwards, the top part of these windows just collapsed downwards at random times. Also it was freezing cold outside and the heater was not working. When I informed the staff about the problems, there was no apology or recognition. The only good thing I can say is that the room was clean, the decoration is modern, and it's located in a very good shopping area, and right next to the tube and bus stops. It is no where near worth what it charges."
103,1084,"Jan 21 2005	Excellent service throughout	Stayed for my wife's birthday treat.I mentioned it on booking through lastminute and we were upgraded to a deluxe room. Altho a little street noise from Oxford St, it was excellent. A small but beautifully designed bathroom and big comfy bed with lots of pillows and a nice sitting area and top class B&amp;O tv.Staff couldn't have been any more helpful.They were courteous on check out and check in, with lots of questions about whether we were enjoying our stay and if there was anythingwe could do.1st class in my opinion, although we were in a deluxe room!"
104,1084,"Jan 17 2005	BREAKFAST ??????????	HELLO,Stayed at this hotel from 31-12-04 until 02-01-05.Check-in was perfect, the lady at the front desk did there best to have a room cleaned earlier than usual. Room was perfect because we had a free upgrade to a delux room. Only the soft mattress, but that's (until now) in any Londen hotel. (Do's anybody know a hotel in London which hasn't ?)Breakfast : what a disappointment. Because it was newyears eve they informed us that the breakfast would be served until 12.00 PM. Nice gesture. But what a disappointment when we arrived at 11.00 AM. Half the selection was already gone and what was left was of such a bad quality. Esspecially when they promote it with &quot;Edwardian breakfasts, A Great British start to the day&quot; ! Great start when when one has so little to chose of. Next day same problem. The kitchen can't cope with it and the staff didn't see much.Conclusion : room good breakfast terrible. Would I go back ; NO."

2,1085,"Nov 22 2009 	Feels like a boutique hotel not a chain	This is the 3rd time I've stayed at the Radisson Bloomsbury Street and every time I'm made to feel very well-taken care of. From the front-of-house staff to the personalized welcome in my room, it definitely doesn't feel like a chain hotel. The level of service is most assuredly top-notch and I don't hesitate to recommend them to anyone wishing to stay in London. The added bonus - they're just around the corner from the British Museum. Well done once again!"
3,1085,"Nov 22 2009 	Brilliant hotel friendly staff superb location!	We booked a standard Queen Bedded room as we were seeing a show at the Leicester Square Theatre. The room was not ready when we arrived, however we were offered complimentary drinks while we waited for the room. When our room was ready we were asked if we needed help with our bags, and the staff were very warm, welcoming and very polite. We went out for the evening, and when we returned at 10pm, we sat in the bar with a lovely bottle of red wine, the ambience was perfect, never have I had such a nice time in London. We could not fault this hotel, the room was clean and beautifully decorated, the security was brilliant - you could not enter where the bedrooms are located without having a key card. The location was second to none - we will be back and we will recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to listen!! We did not try the food at this hotel, but when we return, we will ensure that we fit in a meal as the restaurant looked lovely, relaxed and friendly."
4,1085,"Nov 21 2009 	Perfect fantastic everything you would wish for	Perfect, fantastic everything we could have wished for and all down to superb customer care and attention. Kris the manager looked after us after we expressed our disappointment with the room we were staying in the sister hotel the Kenilworth, it was small with the double bed against the wall, hardly a romantic setting for a romantic weekend in London. To make amends for our disappointment, Kris arranged for us to have a complimentary breakfast and moved us to the Bloomsbury, and our disappointment soon turned to delight as he showed us to a beautiful suite as a way to make up for our previous night, it was a beautiful room and the hotel staff were friendly and attentive. The food in the hotel was excellent. Thank-you Kris for your excellent care and lovely manner. Patricia and Sam Belfast"
5,1085,"Nov 20 2009 	Fantastic Location	This hotel is in a great location, however, the 'Background' music is too loud in the Reception area and it is difficult to hear the Receptionist whilst checking in.We were given a room that had an off-putting smell of drains and the hotel was reluctant to give us another room immediately. They fobbed us off with a Maintenance Man with a bottle of bleach. This didn't solve the problem. It wasn't until one of the Housekeeping staff told us that there is always a problem smell in that particular room that the hotel relented and agreed to change our room. They clearly knew there was a drainage problem when they allocated us this room.Drinks in the bar are expensive and there is a service charge on top.Breakfast was lovely but the dining room is too cramped.This hotel is not good value for money."
6,1085,"Nov 19 2009 	A luxurious Hotel	This is a beautfiul hotel, from the moment you walk in the surroundings are luxurious and the staff are eager to help. The rooms are beautiful and the tshort walk from the escalator to the room was a treat with the softest carpets ever !!!!! We requested bath robes and they came very quickly and were lovely and soft........oh and the shower was fabulous too !!!We also ate in the restaurant and the staff were very friendly and helpful and the steak was amazing. We also had an even and the conference facilities are exceptional. Again the staff were friendly and the warm buffet lunch was enjoyed by everyone (60 delegates).I would definitely come back for business or pleasure."
7,1085,Nov 18 2009	The best babyshower ever!	We held my baby shower at the hotel and had lunch. I had about 20 guests and a set menu lunch. It was a fantastic afternoon. From the planning stags to the end of the afternoon it was a pleasant experience. The staff were all professional and friendly. We were looked after and given 5 star service.The food was fabulous! All my guests were extremely impressed!I would recommend the hotel for any function.

I happened to be travelling with colleagues this trip but often travel on my own. And as a woman traveller, it is important to me that I feel safe. And yes, at this hotel I feel very safe indeed. The Raddison Edwardian Bloomsbury (apart from the tragically long name) is a great hotel. The staff are friendly yet professional. I have always experienced the best service from all the staff. The rooms are pleasant and well appointed, some are very small but you have a choice!! Want something bigger?? Upgrade! I love the free internet!! And the location is perfect - walking, underground or by cab, you are in the heart of the city!! Enjoy your stay - I always do!!"
9,1085,"Nov 11 2009 	Nice hotel with excellent service	We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in September. We came to hotel early morning and they gave us a room. Check in was very easy. The hotel is located in an area with good access to public transport and is within easy walking distance to a number of shopping districts and restaurants. Very close to British Museum. The hotel is very nice with beautiful rooms and bathrooms. All staff members were very friendly, polite and efficient. Our special thanks to Mr. Kumar, the Guest Relations Manager, for helping us in reservation and for his outstanding customer service and very professional too.Overall, very nice stay and a good price for central London hotel. I would definitely recommend it."
10,1085,"Nov 8 2009 	Comfortable and Just right for the Theatres etc	The room was very comfortable and clean, the staff where very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was very good with a good selection of food and drinks. The decor through out the hotel has a lot of black marble with darkish wall covering, very smart but not every one`s choice if a bright and airy is colour scheme is prefered."
11,1085,"Nov 7 2009 	There are better hotels out there.....	Have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels all over the world and this one was less than impressive. I was there for a 2 day Medical Conference arranged by a drug company which paid the bill.... ( I would have been much more annoyed if I had to pay for this myself)The lobby was attractive but thats about all that was good. The room was TINY and I had a wonderful view of a wall from my equally tiny window.The TV had about 5-6 channels (they could at least invest in a freeview box which would triple their channel choice). I mentioned to the receptionist that my TV remote was dead and she said someone would sort it ....but of course no one did.The small bathroom was clean but the shower had low pressure.The room was also a bit dusty which a colleague of mine in another room also mentioned the next morning.To top it off, I received a wake up call the next morning at 730am which I hadn't requested...later found out that the lady in the queue behind me (while I was telling the receptionist about the remote control) had asked for a 730am wake up call which she never got.  Overall I wasn't at all impressed. Am just glad that I didn't have to pay for it. Maybe we were put in 'second class' rooms because it was a mass booking by a company. The food in the restaurant was quite tasty.  But seriously....london has far better hotels to offer in the same price range. Don't be fooled by the lobby....."
12,1085,"Nov 7 2009 	Simply the best!	A pleasure to stay here. Super location, extremley efficient and friendly staff. Atmosphere with lots of vitality, very clean &amp; comfortable.

13,1085,"Nov 4 2009 	Great location stylish modern decor	Fantastically placed for the West End without being right in it. Stayed here and went to the Colliseum (English National Opera, straight down the road; also very handy for the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden). Friendly professional staff, well decorated rooms (not the biggest, but it's central London). Also check out the Lebanese restaurant, right over the road and open until late."

We stayed at the Raddison to watch a show and take in a meal at Covent garden.The hotel is modern with fantastic rooms, all have flat screen tv's with connectivity, and the bathrooms are fantastic with walk in showers with modern tiling and accesories.The staff are friendly, particularly the Concierge for who nothing is too much trouble.I would reccomend a stay as the central location is great for theatreland, Covent Garden etc...highly reccomended."
15,1085,"Nov 2 2009 	A 5 star hotel with 4 star prices!!!	We have been fortunate enough to stay in some excellent hotels around the world including The Wynn (Las Vegas), The Ritz Carlton South Beach (Miami) and can easily say that the Radisson Bloomsbury is equal to if not better than these hotels with respect to its customer service. The level of this service is second to none the staff are both polite and courteous and will do all they can to accommodate your needs. We had the pleasure of meeting Kumar who is the Guest Relations Manager at the hotel and is a credit to the Radisson Edwardian family. The hotel itself is beautiful and the restaurant is extremely comfortable with an excellent menu. London is very competitive when it comes to hotels and restaurants but I highly recommend not only staying in this hotel but dining in the restaurant. This is the only place well be staying for our next and future visits.Thanks once again for all your help Kumar it was a great couple of days made all the better by the hotel and your outstanding service."
16,1085,"Nov 2 2009 	The hotel surpassed expectations which made for a perfect stay	Although we only stayed there one night, the service, quality of the surroundings and general feel of the whole hotel helped make the stay very special"
17,1085,"Nov 1 2009 	Well located nice rooms boutique feel.	Well located, two blocks from British Museum. Walking distance from Tottenham Court Tube station. Close to many West End theatres. Clean, boutiquey feel. Rooms seem bigger than your average London hotel. Just beware if you are sensitive to perfume as they use quite a bit of aromatherapy in the lobby.Be careful with the WiFi - it is free, so DON'T plug into the hardline in the room - that one costs money."
18,1085,Nov 1 2009 	Total commitment to customer care	A fine hotel styled with luxurious and elegant furnishings in all areas. Although the first room we were shown to was a bit small we were quickly given another one and a plausible explanation for the problem. The service was excellent and courteous. Also very convenient as well - 10 minutes from Covent Garden / Embankment and across the road from the British Museum.
19,1085,"Oct 28 2009 	Excellent Hotel	I stayed at the hotel for my son's 13th birthday treat and have to say I was impressed !Check in was a smooth process and the reception staff were paticularly helpful - even noting that it was my son's birthday. Although we knew the hotel was central we didn't realise it was so central ..... only 3 minutes brisk walk to Oxford Street, Covent Garden and 10 minutes walk to Carnaby street. Tube close by - choice from Holborn or Tottenham Court Road. We had a deluxe room which was large and spacious, tastefully decorated and had the 'Radisson' smell which I love. Breakfast had a great selection and the staff once again were paticularly helpful. Overall great stay at a reasonable price - would definately recommend it."
20,1085,"Oct 27 2009 	Excellent Hotel Great Location	We were in London for a sporting event and were seeking a good hotel in an excellent location. After much searching we settled on the Radisson Bloomsbury and upon arrival it was clear that we had made an excellent choice. Rooms were tastefully decorated and the staff at the hotel were helpful and courteous. The hotel is located close to numerous, pubs, restaurants and entertainment. The hotel is located in an area with good access to public transport and is within easy walking distance a number of shopping districts. We thorough enjoyed our stay and it will be our hotel of choice during our next trip to London."
21,1085,"Oct 26 2009 	Excellent Hotel	It's difficult to find a good Hotel in London which is excellent value for money but this hotel is it. The rooms are nice, clean and modern. The hotel is very receptive to suggestions for improvement to their services. I had a problem with the person who checked me in on my first visit so I alerted the hotel to this and they fixed the problem. I have stayed twice now and will return. The location is fabulous. The concierges could not be better."
22,1085,"Oct 26 2009 	Perfect luxury	Staff friendly and efficient, great service and happy faces everywhere. First floor king deluxe room was as described - luxurious and very clean. Free newspaper for the morning will be slipped under your door so make sure you pick from the choice of Telegraph or Times. There will be magazines in your room too. You need the card key to use the lifts and access each floor if using the stairs so security is tight. My friends stayed in similar rooms on third floor and fourth - all just as lovely. We did book 'twins' but were given king size beds which we didn't mind as they were huge. Not even sure if they do twin beds so check this if it matters to you. Overlooked main road but not noisy at all - just the odd siren which you have to expect in a city (and I'm a light sleeper!). Watch the 'London channel' on the tv if you're not a local - very interesting. Ideal location for theatre, shops and mooching around the main tourist places. Best of all was the everything! Can't fault anything. We arrived early at midday and were able to check in even though it says 2pm check in. We parked in the NCP carpark on Great Russell Street - 31 per day - car park was really empty! Very short walk to the hotel. On the day we checked out, the Staff were happy to store our luggage (in a unused locked conference room) until much later that day when we were ready to leave London. Decor very simple - purples and dark marble flooring with wonderful pieces of art and sculptures giving an elegant feel to the hotel. Very thick bouncy carpet along the corridors mean you do not hear anyone around you. We did not have breakfast so cannot comment on the food but we stayed for afternoon tea / coffee before leaving London and relaxed in the bar area and were treated very well. Would definitely consider booking this hotel the next time we visit London."
23,1085,"Oct 22 2009 	brill	We visited this hotel on the 17th till the 19th of october, Very nice hotel the location was perfect, as in the theater district, and close, to most attractions,I found the hotel staff very helpful and polite, I would recommend this hotel to anybody, ps the food was good too"
24,1085,"Oct 22 2009 	Beautifully appointed hotel in very handy location	I stayed at this hotel for one night on 20th Oct 2009, Room 4009. I booked through my company and the B&amp;B rate was 112 inclusive. The hotel appears to have been recently refurbished and although the hotel is possibly early 20th century the decor is very modern and minimalist in style.It is clean, smart and everything is new. The bedding is new, the bathrooms are new and it's all beautifully clean and sweet-smelling.The breakfast was lovely, they even had fresh strawberries and raspberries on the breakfast buffet. While I was staying at the hotel I went to see Thriller Live at the Lyric Theatre (the evening showing). I was able to walk there in 10 mins (no need for a taxi) and I also walked back alone after the show. There are plenty of people around and the area feels very safe.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel - it was a joy to stay there! I can't think of anything to fault about it. However I didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening or use the bar so can't comment on those aspects."
25,1085,"Oct 21 2009 	Excellent hotel	We stayed here in October 2009. We were met outside the hotel and our luggage was taken to our room. Check in was smooth and our room was clean and modern and the bed very comfortable. The hotel staff were very helpful and efficient. However, the bar is very expensive, we had 4 drinks which cost 30.00. The hotel location is perfect for Oxford Street and all of the major attractions. Would definitely recommend and stay here again."
26,1085,"Oct 20 2009 	Bit of a gem for Central London	I have got so tired of staying in poor London accommodation and now use the Crowne Plaza, Ealing as my base for business trips to London. Yesterday (Monday) however I had to stay in London and was anticipating an uninspiring stay at the Radisson. I walked into a nice reception but was all the time thinking &quot;yes wait until I get out of the lift and the corridors will be shabby  a usual trick.&quot; To my surprise the corridors looked smart as I made my way out of the lifts to room 6006 - still thinking the room itself was going to be the let down. To my delight I walked into a well furnished room with modern fixtures and fittings - over the moon. The best bit was the peace and quiet. No discernible traffic noise  amazing and a good night sleep. The morning breakfast did not disappoint. A good selection of food with pleasant staff. Thank you Radisson for restoring my faith in Central London accommodation. The only catch here was that I was upgraded. I am willing to take a chance to see if my visit next week bags me the same standard of accommodation. Fingers crossed."
27,1085,"Oct 20 2009 	Perfect	This must be the perfect hotel room for that price . The Interior design is stunning , people very nice . The room size , bed , bath is for this price so central in London a great find....."
28,1085,"Oct 16 2009 	Sophisticated elegant hotel in very central location	I stayed here in Sept 09 when I visited London on a business trip. The hotel was fantastic - really upmarket looking and sophisticated. The staff very exceptionally friendly and professional - nothing was a bother for them. I got an upgrade to a kingsize room - loved the furnishings and the bathroom/ shower.Breakfast offered a huge selection, again the staff could not have been more helpful. The decor of the hotel (all areas) was modern but with a warm elegance. The hotel was a few minutes from Tottenham Court Rd tube station which meant travelling about London was really easy.I wish I could have stayed longer - maybe next time! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates receiving friendly, professional service and a luxurious bathroom!!"
29,1085,"Oct 15 2009 	Recommended for business or holidays	I have been 5-6 times in this hotel during the last year, the hotel quality is very good but they still have to improve the cleaning, this is my main concern.The hotel is moderm and the staff very friendly, recomended for business or holidays."
30,1085,"Oct 14 2009 	Never again. Better choices abound in this part of London.	The hotel was overpriced, the room so small we cold barely move around let alone open our luggage. The drain overflowed when you took a shower so the bathroom flooded out into the room. The whole hotel is scented with something that smells like overpowering perfume and the front desk staff are condescending.Only good part was free high speed internet and business centre use."
31,1085,"Oct 14 2009 	Big disappointment	As a frequent, worldwide traveller, I have seldom been more disappointed. Client service - both in person and in amenities - was well below par, from the employee who let the hotel door slam in front of my sister as she was struggling with two big suitcases, to the lack of signage to help the customer know where to find anything, to the cash-grabby attitude to customer service (late checkout? that'll be 20 pounds an hour please!), and to the slimy concierge who insisted that we use &quot;his&quot; taxi to get to Paddington, when there were tons available on the street. The room was terrible for the money we paid (about C$400): small and cramped (no room to lie down the suitcases even), overly hot, a non-functioning fridge, tv with the fewest possible channels, and - the worst - the teeny shower which flooded the bathroom (amazingly, it seemed designed to cascade out onto the main floor!). But don't confuse the Radisson Bloomsbury STREET Hotel with the Bloomsbury Hotel (around the corner): the latter is lovely and I thoroughly regretted trying something new this time. Radisson should learn that investing in a swanky lobby does not make up for a total lack of concern for the client themselves."
32,1085,"Oct 13 2009 	delightfull	It is the best stay I've had in a London' hotel. A great hotel. A great service. The staff is so professionnal. the decoration is stylish, It is beautifu placel. The hotel is very well situated too. they made my stay. thank you again. I should recommand it to any one."
33,1085,"Oct 12 2009 	Lovely hotel in a great location apart from a few faults	I have just come back from staying a weekend at this hotel and was very suprised at how close it is to Tottenham Court Road station. Literally a 3 min walk from a station which has great access to other areas i.e. leiscester square. And easily walkable to oxford street's great shops. Dont bother walking from Holborn.We arrived at the hotel around 9pm and prior to arrival I emailed the hotel to give my requests i.e. high floor. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a lovely receptionist who completed check-in. This hotel is very very modern, funky, and boutique i.e. black floor, velvet walls however there was quite large music around the reception area and both if us could hear what each other was saying.The receptionist explained that we had to put the keycard in the lift before pressing the floor button but people still seemed to get confused about this coming back to reception to say the lift didnt work! On entering our floor the hallways are just amazing, big sculptures and plush carpets. Even better when we got to our superior room (6020) which although cosy, was filled with a few special touches i.e. round glass table, big flatscreen tv, and velvet bed throw and extra pillows. They have done a good job. If you like a good bathroom then come here... rainforest shower head, gilchrest &amp; soames bath products, hand wash &amp; body lotion. Best of all the bathroom is huge!!!Breakfast was included with the package and it really was good. There was a menu where you could have anything cooked up for you, some free, and some chargeable like smoked haddock or kipper (2). Still good value. If you like your fruit then they offer fresh strawberrys, raspberrys as well as melon, orange, and pineapple. Cooked breakfast was great with 2 types of bacon, sausages, eggs and lots more. Hardly ever had to wait and got seated straight away both days. However we did notice that once my parter drank a yakult that it was a week out of date! He informed Robin the restaurant supervisor and he apologised and offered us a free drink in the bar, which was quite generous. Once we left for the day we forgot to put our 'clean room' button on, but I though that all the hotels I have been to they would clean the room anyway.. wrong, we returned at 4pm to find the room hadnt been cleaned, but once we went out and put the light on, we came back to find it had all been done. Great service considering most housekeeping go home at 2pm.My only major gripe was that our safe didnt work in the room for the entire trip. Initially I phoned reception who could barely hear me due to the music as mentioned before but she came up straight away and said that maintanence had gone home and will be in the next day. Came back to our room the next evening to find nothing had been done. This was very frustrating as we had to take our valuable out with us and just did not 100% trust the reception safe.Overall the hotel interior is top notch, location.. one of the best around. We were obviously unlucky with the safe issue but it really is a good 5* hotel and not to snobby!"
34,1085,"Oct 11 2009 	fantastic	we really loved it here the staff were so friendly and helpful to, the room was spotless and so comfortable to, can not fault this place at all had a great weekend we also read tripadvisor and its so true this place is beauifull cant wait to go back to london and stay here again thanks from mr and mrs tucker portsmouth"
35,1085,Oct 8 2009 	Lovely place in the city but you don't know it.	From the courtyard entry to the over the top greeting you feel welcome and pampered. Once inside check in was fast. The room we had was large and so was the bathroom unlike most hotel rooms we have stayed in Europe. Convenient to the tube. Great restaurants within walking distance. I hope we can get back to London again soon. We would stay here again!
36,1085,"Oct 7 2009 	Elegant and sophisticated but a bit too fragrant...	We spent five really happy days at this classy and well situated hotel. Everything from the staff to the bedding was perfect - clean, comfortable and relaxing...except.... for the very strong air freshener scent in the lobby reception area. I am not one of those scent sensitive people by any means, but I found the floral perfumey odour in the main reception area really, really over powering. Other than that, absolutely no complaints! Our twin room looked out over the front of the hotel but it was very quiet - lovely street view and leafy green trees. The staff were super helpful and didn't have a problem when we asked for the mini bar to be emptied so we could put our own food in the fridge (even though it was probably a bit of a hassle for them). Would definitely stay here again!"
37,1085,"Oct 7 2009 	Beautiful hotel with a lovely ambience	This hotel gives very welcoming and courteous service. Our room was a spacious one on the 6th floor. The location is exellent, with Covent Garden and Soho approximately 5 minutes walk away. Tottenham Court Road tube station is also very nearby.This is a very nice hotel that I am looking forward to return to."
38,1085,"Oct 6 2009 	Nice hotel- but not good service	Booked this hotel in August for and October weekend. Seems nice since the refit but had we the following problems:1. checkin took over 30 minutes as the could not find the booking. had a printout and confirmation on my iphone but still had to wait 30minutes and made to sit on the &quot;naughty step&quot; Eventually got to the room (even though they hadnt found details) and they rang the following day to say they had &quot;found the details&quot;2. House keeping were knocking at the door at 8.30 am on a saturday- we said we would be gone in 10minutes but when we came back at 15.30 the room handt been touched. I put the do not disturb sign up so I could have a rest before going out again- but as soon as I fell asleep- housekeeping telephoned to ask why I had got the &quot;do not disturb&quot; on the door and when could they service the room! 3. the keys only worked some of the time. If you have ever waited ages for the lift, walked down corridors with bags- only for the key not to work- you will know how annoying this can be.....4. breakfast! The restaurant is not big enough.. Sunday morning we were in a que with 40 other people waiting for a seat- my adivce would be don't bother- find somewhere else for breakfast if you have to stop here.in summary the hotel is nice and rooms good- although ive had a much better expericnce in a premier inn at a LOT less money. Shame."
39,1085,"Oct 5 2009 	A wonderful experience in London	We recently stayed at the Raddisson Edwardian hotel on Bloomsbury Street. We found the hortel itself very modern, hip and clean. The staff all friendly and willing to make our stay a most enjoyable one.We felt comfortable that you needed your key to operate the elevator and felt that was a very good security function. The room was quite large and beautifully appointed. The bath very modern, and beatiful with all the ammenities one would need including a heated towel rack and separate LARGE shower.The bedroom was in soothely stylish decor and colors. A delightful room., The bed comfortable and room service proved quick and efficient as well.Our only two minor concerns which we did verse with the management upon leaving were two small annoyances. 1/ The refuse pail was large and useful, however they place a plastic bag less than one third its size within it. Obviously the first pieces of trash you throw into it,, the plastic bag falls to the floor of the pale and is now rendered useless and annoying as you must constanrtly bend down to open it and try tro fit tre gardage into it. A quick fix and no anxiety for the guest- A proper size Plastic bag (SOlVED) the only minor other problem was teh lighting. There are ample ceiling lights throughout the room, on a dimmer, so all the lights on high work great, or dimmed low for moos wonderful, however I you want to sit at the chairs b y the table an read,, you must keep the lights up high,and it makes it impossible for someone else in teh room to simply take a nap. The addition of a lamp on that table for not too much money would solve teh problem easily.Lastly- the placement of the hotel is WONDERFUL. A stroll to Soho and the restaurants and theartres. Its greatly situation, around the corner from the British Museum.Everyone who stays there will enjoy their trip."
40,1085,"Oct 4 2009 	Classy friendly stylish and all in an excellent location!	My boyfriend and I stayed here for my 40th birthday weekend and with the number of hotels in London, it was hard to make a decision on which one to choose. I'm so pleased that we decided to go with the Radisson Bloomsbury Street; it exceeded my expectations in all areas - and I would have been absolutely gutted to have chosen badly on such a special occasion. Every single member of staff was professional, friendly and courteous and Ona (who cleaned our room) really went the extra mile for me once she learned it was my birthday; she really helped to make it special."
41,1085,"Oct 4 2009 	A superb hotel in a wonderfully central location	Having stayed at this hotel for a number of years, we are still delighted with all aspects, especially the service and friendliness of the staff. Just a few hundred metres from the British Museum and many theatres, it is a perfect location for short breaks."
42,1085,"Oct 2 2009 	Lovely clean friendly welcoming hotel	Ideal for Oxford Street shopping and a very short walk to Tottenham Court Road tube so ideal for short tube rides to main London Attractions. This was our second stay at this hotel. We last stayed at Christmas and had a wonderful time in the beautifully decorated surroundings. Lovely staff, excellent food, relaxing stay! Will definitely stay here again when we next visit London."
43,1085,"Oct 2 2009 	Elegant comfortable stay	Rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Room service was excellant.Bar in the evening was delightful for a late night drink."
44,1085,"Sep 25 2009 	Excellent Hotel with fantastic staff!	We stayed for only one night at the Radisson and the staff were wonderful and the hotel was lovely. The room we had overlooked onot the back which was a little nosy as it backed onto a residential apartment block - however, this did not spoil our break in any way! We would definately return. The hotel staff couldnt do enough for us - very attentative and willing to help ALWAYS. Excellent place to stay would highly recommend! (Excellent location! Only round the corner from Convent Garden and if you're a stage lover then youre right down the road from ALL the shows! It was fab!!)"
45,1085,"Sep 21 2009 	Would Stay Again	Good location for central london, service was very good, not the cheepest hotel in London but with 4* rating you get what you pay for. If I had to find any fault the only one is at Breakfast time the resturant got quite busy but we were warned of this by a sign by the lift and avoided those times"
46,1085,"Sep 18 2009 	Modern comfortable and great staff	I have been in this hotel many times for several years now (it was called Radisson Marlborough before). They have done major renovations in the hotel (entrance, restaurant, rooms) and the result is superb. I liked it before but currently, in my opinion, it is one of the best hotels in London (and the location is wonderful!). It really has a modern style but it is very comfortable and it has a familiar atmosphere. The staff is great (especially at the restaurant) and, in the very few occasions that I had to report a problem, they have dealt with it quickly."
47,1085,"Sep 17 2009 	Modern hotel in great location but rooms are small.	We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel and were very pleased overall. We were able to get into our room a few hours early (we requested early check-in) and were also upgraded to a &quot;deluxe&quot; room upon arrival. The hotel and rooms are very modern and clean. Our room, despite being a &quot;deluxe&quot;, was very small, with the king-sized bed taking up most of the room. There was a small desk and chair that took up more room. However, the room amenities were very nice, there was sufficient clothing storage, and the bed was very comfortable. The only issue we had was storing our two big suitcases without taking up more space.The bathroom was quite roomy and modern with nice amenities. The only issue we had with the bathroom was flooding the floor every time we took a shower, due to the half-sized shower door.The location of the hotel is excellent, with the Tottenham Court Tube station about a 5 min. walk away. The British Mueum is across the street, and you are also about 10 minutes walk from Charlotte Street, where there are many restaurants and pubs.The hotel management is very responsive to any issues, as I received a personal email after doing an online survey, which addressed some of the points made in my review."
48,1085,"Sep 15 2009 	Over-rated - good location but room tiny and breakfast bad.	We travel to London regularly and have stayed in many 4* hotels in the City. Our favourite is the Marylebone Hotel (Jurys Clifton Ford) and after our recent stay at the Radisson Bloomsbury st. that does not change.The Radisson hotel has some very positive points - in particular the location. Very close to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station and within walking distance of Covent Garden, Soho, Oxford Street. It is 15 seconds walk from the British Museum. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful and I would put them top of the list for this. This is especially the case for the reception and concierge staff. Well Done. Staff in the breakfast room were the complete opposite though. Thats another story. First time I've even been shouted at in a restaurant. I asked for butter - none came with the cold toast - and was walking back to my table when I heard the girl shout an Oi Mate at me and handed me a small dish of butter. So much for table service and manners!!! The rooms: TINY TINY TINY - even compared to other similar London hotels. I know we had a good deal through superbreak that included breakfast, but it was only 15stg of a saving and that does not permit putting a 6ft 2 person into a room where the roof was almost hitting his head and legs off the end of the tiny double bed. Ok - they did change us when I explained the situation. Was told it was an upgrade. What a load of rubbish.... if it was an upgrade I would have been so angry to have paid more for it. Almost no room to walk around the bed. Obviously close to a bar/nightclub playing techno music until 1.30am. When I lied down in bed I could see the ripples in my bedside water glass from the thumping music. I would say it was one of the most noise afflicted hotels I have stayed in. Doors banging all night, front of house powerhosing at 5.30am followed by room above having bath at 6am. They might as well have been in the room with us. The noise insulation is bad. Room was very dark. Bathroom was large, with heated towel rain and lovely fluffy towels. However, the flood that was on the slippy floor when we had a shower meant that we had to use one of the bath towels to mop up the leakage from the inadequate shower screen. I slipped getting out of the bath but managed to right myself. I mentioned this to the check-out staff but was just told it would be looked into and sorry about that. Breakfast was just OK. Typical english breakfast and some fruit, cereal and youghurt available. Q was massive and the room was full to capacity. Tables all on top of each other and only 3 staff visible. One of which was the rude butter girl. Orange juice was like acid. I know this review sounds bad and I guess it wasnt the worst experience ever - but it was just for one night and when converted to Euro it cost 200 euro. Not worth it at all. The staff and location were top notch but the room and breakfast general darkness of the place made it a bad experience."
49,1085,"Sep 15 2009 	Great Bed and central location	We chose the hotel because it is more wheelchair accessible than the other hotels we researched in London. We were travelling with my father and mother and wheelchair accessibility was a major concern. Their room was great and our room was right across the hall.The king sized bed was comfortable and the room was large enough so that the bed did not swallow the room. The decoration was more boutique than large chain. We had ample storage for our clothes and the bathroom was so large we left our suitcases in the bathroom with more than enough room for two adults. We could see the grounds for the British museum from the entrance to the hotel. The front desk staff were sensitive and attentive to any request that we had. The &quot; English &quot; breakfast was worth every pound and our family of non-breakfast eaters started off everyday having breakfast in the lobby.This area was close enough for us to walk (push) to Covent Gardens, SOHO and even the Tate Modern. This location was central to all of the train statinos that we needed for our side trips. We usually stay in boutique / small hotels but we did not feel lost in this hotel thanks to the recent renovation and staff attentiveness."
50,1085,Sep 10 2009 	Another endorsement for this lovely hotel	Stayed for a 2 night leisure break after finding a great &quot;Friday night free&quot; deal on the hotel web site. The recently renovated rooms and public areas are tasteful and modern with touches of luxury throughout and the courteous staff thoroughly deserve all their positive reviews. The buffet breakfast was not included in our rate so we paid for the continental breakfast and were very satisfied with the range of cereals/fruit/pastries/cold meats served in the chic restaurant area. The hotel is in a great location for the West End shops and theatre district and is also a short walk from the bustle of Covent Garden and Leicester Square. Will definitely put the Bloomsbury Street at the top of our list for the next trip to London!
51,1085,"Sep 8 2009 	Excellent Hotel	We stayed at this hotel in august and found it to be superb. The entrance/reception area is very impressive. The room we had was large and very plush with a huge 40inch tv and big comfy bed.The staff were very helpful and friendly.The only downside was the bar prices. The hotel has a stunning bar area with huge plush sofas and lots of black marble and it would be a lovely place to have a drink before going up to bed but the prices were stupid. We had two brandies and one coffee and the brandies, which were just one pub measure of brandy, were 10 each!! this is way overpriced and just annoyed us. Hence this lovely bar was always empty!"
52,1085,"Sep 6 2009	FANTASTIC!!!!!	My mother-in-law and i stayed here for one night as a birthday celebration to see a show at a theatre - we were really impressed with the decor as we entered the hotel as it looked very luxurious with the lovely ornaments and the clean spacious areas. our room was not ready so we had a drink in the bar area while we waited. the staff were very friendly and the tableware was gorgeous with free snacks. all be it a little expensive at 3.50 for a cup of tea! our room was fantastic with all the amenities you could wish for, ironing board and iron, flat screen tv,lovely walk in shower and very clean and spacious. on our departure,the lift was broken so one of the staff carried our bags down the stairs for us! we were able to leave our bags in their 'lobby' until it was ready for us to travel home.the staff were very helpful and flagged down a taxi for us.we really enjoyed our stay here - would highly recommend this hotel and may return very soon. Thank you."
53,1085,"Sep 6 2009 	Excelent stay for a city hotel providing a theatre break really relaxing and made to feel very welcome	this hotel provided my wife and I, a perfect theatre weekend, an hotel which is close to all the theatres. Rooms were very modern with all amenities.Staff was very friendly and helpful.I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will definately return again"
54,1085,"Sep 4 2009 	Fantastic hotel	We staid in the Radisson for 1 night as we went to the theatre. We could not fault the hotel and the staff were great as well, very friendly and helpful. It is in an excellent location for the theatre and very close to a tube station. We would recommend a stay there. A++++"
55,1085,"Sep 1 2009 	beautifull hotel small room!	We stopped for one night and the service was excellent, the hotel was beautifull and plush and always smelt like flowers ( i think they pumped air freshener through air con)its recently be renovated and you can tell as everything is brand new and spotless, the security is very good, if you want to get to the bedrooms via lift or stairs you need to have room key to activate.The area is lovely its very close to the attractions and the theatre but in a very safe neighbourhood.The buffet breakfast is a real treat and well stocked, the restaurant is great and the staff are very friendly.The only thing I didnt like about the whole hotel was the smallness of the room for the price but it is London and it did have the benifit of air con so I maybe being picky lol!"
56,1085,"Aug 31 2009 	Fabulous stay!	From entering the hotel, to checking-out, the whole experience was FABULOUS! Recently renovated, contemporary in design and minimalstic in appearance, the hotel was spotlessly clean!The breakfast room was air conditioned and spacious. My bedroom was large, tastefully decorated, with plasma TV, iron board and iron. The bathroom was amazing!!The hotel staff are very pleasant, courteous and helpful.And.... its location is brilliant -close to Covent Garden."
57,1085,Aug 31 2009 	Great staff great location	Stayed recently for our aniversary. Staff are great and it is just near the Bristish Musem and Oxford street so a great place to base yourself when you are in the city.The hotel has been recently refurbished which makes a great difference
58,1085,"Aug 30 2009 	Just a perfect weekend	We were orginally booked into a double but to our delight up graded free,the room was large clean and modern with all the usual things tea coffee etc, the bathroom was the same large clean and modern with bathrobes.The buffet breakfast was great all you can eat with a wide choice of food from fresh fruit ,pastries, cerals and bacon, eggs etc.All the staff were very polite, helpful and friendly.It made our weekend to see the Jersey Boys perfect,I would stay again no problem and would recomend this hotel to any one"
59,1085,"Aug 27 2009 	The most convenient comfortable and out of the way hotel you'll find in Central London	we stayed at the Radisson Edwardian for a long weekend and had the most comfortable nights sleep ever. In fact, it was so comfortable we just called the hotel to find out what the bed was! As courteous as ever, we got a reply in a day :)Anyway, the hotel is in a fantastic location that is within walking distance of virtually everything you'll want to do in central, central London and if you don't mind the walk you can get to Waterloo and Knightsbridge on foot.Super comfortable beds, courteous staff - maybe the only niggle is the rather average buffet breakfast."
60,1085,"Aug 25 2009 	The best hotel for galleries museums and theatres in London	We had a fantastic stay at the Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury Street. ALL the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The complimentary anniversary sweet they gave us at dinner was a very nice touch and much appreciated. The room was lovely. Absolutely brilliant and, of course, the location was perfect for the theatre, galleries and the British Museum. 10 out of 10! We will DEFINITELY be back and have already recommended you to friends and family planning to go to London."
61,1085,"Aug 25 2009 	great hotel	the hotel was beutifull, always smelling good, the service was excellent, i came here for medical reasons and was taken care of by staff including house manager...the location of the hotel is perfect, i was in a fragile state but the comfortness of the room exceeded my expectations... surely i recomend this hotel and the next time i come here for my surgery ill be staying here."
62,1085,"Aug 24 2009 	Just right for London!	We arrived in a downpour and were treated like special guests. Our room showed up on the computer as not quite ready so the dear man at the front desk went to check it himself. When he returned in about two minutes, he said it was indeed ready and because of the inconvenience (all of five minutes, I kid you not), we were upgraded to a beautiful corner room-5 windows around a curved wall. The amenities were new, elegant, trendy, and comfortable. The heated towel bar dried our soaked clothes! The included breakfast was a great start to each active day.We were one minute from the British Museum which let us visit whenever we had the urge to see something we missed last time out. We were five minutes walk from the theater district where we saw Priscilla, Queen of the Desert--amazingly good--and very close to a tube station. We figured out the buses too and as there are stops just around the corner, everything in town was within easy reach.We will stay here again--no doubt."
63,1085,"Aug 21 2009 	Good hotel for a theatre break	We spent one night at this hotel having been transferred from the Kenilworth ( sister hotel) which did not have room for us. The hotel reception staff at both hotels were efficient, helpful and pleasant. The hotel booking was made as part of a theatre break package and it was certainly very convenient for the Dominion theatre and also the British Museum. Breakfast was good, with varied choices available from fruit to cooked buffet.. Our room was a quiet and comfortable twin but rather small and dark although, as we did not spend much time in the room, this was not an issue. The quiet air conditioning was much appreciated. The only suggestion I would make would be to clear the rubbish, including black bags and wooden palettes that we could see from the small window that looked out onto the internal service area. The fact that this was at the head of fire escape stairs was concerning."
64,1085,"Aug 17 2009 	Ok- very small beds!	Hotel is in a great location walking distance of Oxford st and the theatres. We had booked a double room and when we got to our room we were just shocked by the size of the bed, it was so small! We called reception and they said they didn't have any other rooms, so on our way out I spoke to a guy- can't remember his name but began with a V I think! He said he could move us 2 another hotel- which we didn't want, he said to go out and come back see him later, which we did... He took us to the new room which was a corner room with 2 single beds- we took this room as it was bigger and decided we would get a better sleep with our own beds- would of preferred a big bed but was told they were full! Other than that everything was good. Breakfast was nice and lots of choice, staff were friendly and hotel was very modern. Only 2 things that I would say is, there are no plugs near the mirrors for dryers and straightners, and the hair dryer in room you have 2 hold a button down the whole time you want to use it. Would recommend this hotel with these things in mind."
65,1085,"Aug 13 2009 	Wouldn't hesitate to come back	This is the first time I have stayed at a Radisson Edwardian Hotel and I would definitely return. Having stayed at a number of Hilton hotels before with a view to being loyal to one particular chain, I had noticed an inconsistency in the quality of their hotels and the appalling maintenance and housekeeping of the rooms and grounds in a couple we stayed in recently in Scotland, so we decided to try somewhere different. The online booking process was straightforward and provided a good room rate. The reception staff were friendly and efficient. The hotel exterior and communal areas were very well maintained and appeared immaculately clean and orderly. The room was immaculate and the housekeeping staff were polite and friendly when we spoke to them. The room was in an almost perfect state of repair and the air conditioning was quiet and kept our room comfortable during our stay which was during warm weather. My only minor negative comments would be that the shaving mirror in the bathroom was loose and the large towel rail wasn't working (turned off due to warm weather perhaps?). The reception on the large plasma screen in the room was quite poor however holidays aren't about watching television so this was no problem although if I'd been staying there alone on business this might have been an issue. The room was luxurious and quiet and the bed was very comfortable - almost too comfortable. The ice/water dispenser in the corridor was a nice touch too. The breakfasts were of a high quality with a varied range of foods (buffet/continental/fruits/yoghurts etc.) and the serving and bar staff were courteous and efficient. I hope that these high standards are maintaned as the hotel matures as I realise that it was recently refurbished. I will definitely be choosing one of their hotels over any Hilton when I stay away and hope that the the standards of the other hotels in this range are consistent with those in Bloomsbury Street. The nearest tube station was Tottenham Court Road (5 mins walk) and there are a few restaurants and takeaways around the hotel. The hotel is a short walk to Oxford Street and Russell Square. I would recommend the King Deluxe Room which we upgraded to on arrival. It had his/hers sinks and a glass partitioned wetroom which was huge and had a deluge showerhead as well as a regular showerhead. I'll definitely be back if I get the chance."
66,1085,"Aug 13 2009 	Great location but customer service lacking.	Great ambience at this hotel and ideal location for Covent Garden,Oxford Street and Theatreland.Unfortunately some elements of the stay were disappointing.1.A bedside light was not working and despite 2 promises to rectify it nothing was done.2.The promised vouchers were not received until I returned home3. I did not receive the morning paper(Telegraph) I ordered the night before.The reason given was none were available to the hotel that day!!!No alternative was offered.4.Despite lots of staff being on duty at breakfast attention to detail was missing eg no butter /jams/marmalade...no replenishment of milk/coffee unless one got up from table to ask.Ordering from the menu was also difficult with noone coming to take orders...had to leave table to order.5.Although this was a more expensive hotel(chosen as a special occasion)I've had far better quality/choice /service at breakfast at the Holiday Inn!!!6.Ice machine in corridor did not work.However room was nice and comfortable and the evening meal and service were good."
67,1085,"Aug 12 2009 	Excellent Hospitality !	I just wanted to say what a lovely weekend we had at the Bloomsbury Street hotel. It was my 30th birthday and some friends had travelled from the Isle of Man to stop with me in London. The comfort of the hotel really did help to make it a very memorable couple of days. All the staff were extremely hospitable and the rooms were really comfortable. The fried breakfasts in the mornings were a perfect start to the day and we very much liked the fact you could go up for second helpings !What really was the best thing about the hotel though was the location. I did think it was going to be a little further away from the Covent Garden/Charing Cross Road area but it was literally a five minute walk from the heart of Covent Garden and Theatre Land. It really is pefectly situated and it benefits from just being slightly out of all the hub bub.And finally, we all loved the ice dispensers in the corridors !!We'll definitely all go back again."
68,1085,"Aug 10 2009 	Don't be fooled by the refurb some of the rooms are tiny and dark.	I stayed in thus hotel a few years ago before the refurb and it was so bad I never came back. I only decided to try it again because of a recommendation from a friend. I wish I hadn't bothered. I was offered three rooms all supposed to be doubles. All of them were small and dark and and one had a window that opened out onto a roof section that was covered with cigarette butts. After almost half an hour I have ended up with a room that looks onto a building site. There is no chest of drawers to put anything in, the wardrobe is tiny the safe deposit box too high and awkward to get to and - my pet hate- I cannot sit down in front of a mirror to dry my hair. The mirror is a thin strip above the desk and the chair is too low to let you se yourself in it. Were any women involved in designing the rooms? The lobby and public areas are flash, but other than being a bit cleaner and recently decorated, the rooms are still not up to much. I've cancelled my room for tomorrow night. The staff did their best and were courteous despite me being unhappy."
69,1085,"Aug 6 2009 	Good Price Fab Location Super Front of House Team	Location great, front desk very welcoming, excellent parking service, room small typical London - but had ever thing we needed and tastefully decorated. Breakfast buffet very good selection shame breakfast staff seemed a bit disorganised. Room service didnt sort out our super hot room air didnt appear to be working they fobbed us off, wish now Id gone down to front desk to sort but it was 2:00am. We had an early evening meal in the restaurant okish but not wow, not everything available on the menu. Would stay at the hotel again definitely due to location and very helpful friendly front desk, parking service and concierge.Added bonus free wireless internet access"
70,1085,"Aug 5 2009 	Elegant Sophisticated yet affordable	Dear traveler, The newly renovated Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury Hotel, formerly the Marlborough, is located close to Covent Garden, Oxford Street and the British Museum. A Perfect Location! The moment I stepped into the lobby, I knew that I had made the right choice in choosing the Bloomsbury Street Hotel. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The lobby is very spacious and simply decorated yet very sophisticated and tasteful. I had booked a king deluxe room and was shown several rooms from which to choose. When I saw the rooms, I was impressed at the size of the rooms, but I was also impressed with the size of the bathrooms. Each room had a flat screen TV, a mini bar and complimentary high-speed wireless internet access. The hotel and the rooms are immaculate and well-looked after. I would definitely, without reservation, recommend this hotel to all my friends and colleagues. I can hardly wait to revisit London this spring and stay at the Bloomsbury Street Hotel.  Curt Mortenson Los Angeles, CA."
71,1085,Aug 5 2009 	Great hotel service and location.	Travelled from Sweden to London on vacation. We stayed four of us in two rooms. All areas including the rooms were modern and recently refurbished. The air-conditioning worked fine. The hotel staff was very professional and helpful. Free wireless internet was a definite plus. It was very easy to get to and from the hotel with its convenient location close the British Museum and Subway stations. Walking distance to anywhere in Soho.I can definitely recommend it.
72,1085,"Aug 4 2009 	Excellent location good hotel	For years when in London I've stayed near Great Russel st., British Museum, Tottenham Court Road Undeground Station, Soho and Fitzrovia. This hotel is right there, and that is the main reason I chose it. The hotel itself is in good conditions. We checked in very early and by 10:30 AM we had been given a room that didn't quite fit our expectations (low floor, a big fan as a &quot;view&quot;) but took it, had a nap and a shower and were then allowed to change to a better one. Size is jut OK, I guess fine for a London hotel. The bathroom was very comfortable. The above mentioned change of rooms was the only contact we had with the staff. It is a quite unpersonal hotel, don't expect to be greeted or the door opened for you, but anyway everything seems to work OK. We didn't have breakfast there (quite expensive) but there are plenty of places round the corner, and a small coffee shop exactly across the street where you can have a decent breakfast. All in all, a good experience."
73,1085,"Aug 4 2009 	Hi quality rooms in the heart of London	The Edwardian Bloomsbury hotel is completely renovated, the rooms are fresh, very clean, modern and especally the bathrooms design is superior for this kind of price level.The hotel is value for money plus top location. We have not tried the kitchen."
74,1085,"Aug 3 2009	Very convenient location for theatres	On arriving my 18 year old daughter and I were upgraded by Kumar to a deluxe room with king size bed as no twin beds were available as pre-booked on-line. Kumar was very welcoming and mentioned a note about theatre tickets. ( I had asked the hotel if they could book theatre tickets, I received an e-mail reply in the affirmative about a fortnight later by which time I had purchased the required tickets on-line). Our room was on the 4th floor. A long passage led to a separate wardrobe and desk area beyond which was the bedroom and en-suite bathroom. The bed was very comfortable, the room extremely spacious. There were many windows, all of which opened easily and the room was light and airy, air conditioning was also an option. The decor was subtle and added to the quietness of the room. The bathroom was large with a long bath and modern shower heads. The two way switch at each end of the passage didnt work. The safe was on the top shelf of a tall wardrobe, I am tall and found it cumbersome to access. The buffet breakfasts were fantastic: fresh fruit, nuts pastries, cooked items, one felt spoilt for choice. The breakfast room had a lovely buzz to it and felt warm and welcoming, the staff were very attentive. The hotel is very conveniently located to the West End theatres, all of which are an easy stroll away and to the British Museum. Tottenham Court Road tube station is a few minutes walk away. Wi-fi wasnt working when we arrived, we were told we could use the cable connection at a charge. The next morning wi-fi still wasnt working, we were told we could use the computers in the business centre, a very small room, and both computers were in use. I then asked if we could use the cable connection for free and was told we could do this whilst the wi-fi was down. When we came to check out we were charged for our cable connection time (one hour) whilst wi-fi was down. We were also charged for two bottles of water from the mini bar which we hadnt taken. The person checking us out was cold and aloof and seemed disinclined to believe us, even asking us to name the person who had given us permission to use cable connection for free. (She didnt dispute the non availability of wi-fi). Fortunately Kumar happened to be strolling by and quickly reversed these charges. It did leave a sour taste in the mouth."
75,1085,"Aug 1 2009 	A smart comfortable hotel with great service	I travel to London regularly for both business and pleasure and I always try to stay in Radisson Edwardians so I have stayed in several of them now. After a multi million pound refurb, the Bloomsbury St hotel (formally the Marlborough) is now very smart, comfortable and tranquil. The furnishings and linen are sumptuous and everything is very clean indeed. An acid test for me is always whether a hotel feels clean enough for me to walk on the carpet with bare feet and I certainly can here. The staff are extremely efficient and very friendly both at reception, in the restaurant and housekeeping. Would stay here anytime with my family and have recommended it to business colloeagues. A special thank you to Mr Mehra for sorting out my room booking problem on my last visit!"
76,1085,"Jul 29 2009 	Fabulous Hotel!!!!!!	Spend 4-5 weeks in London a year and have stayed at every hotel possible. The &quot;new&quot; Bloomsbury Hotel is the best of the best. Newly refurbished with stunnning rooms. Great location and best staff I've encountered. Though all the Radisson hotels are generally superior, this is their crown jewel.... The siutes are the most glamourous rooms I've ever seen in London."
77,1085,"Jul 29 2009 	another lovely couple of days in London	we visited London for the second time in a few months to see a show and stayed at the Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury St, once again the reception staff were curtious and helpful, the room was immaculate, although a little noisey ,as this time we had a room at the front, the sirens of police/ambulances was constant, perhaps triple glazing would be better at the front of the hotel... breakfast was great, no wait and plenty of everything.The hotel is just right for theatreland, easy walking distance to theatres, restaurants, pubs and Covent Garden, which we visited before heading home, to stay in a luxurious hotel, makes for a pleasant stay in London."
78,1085,"Jul 29 2009 	Ideal central location for theatreland	Hotel is not too large to be impersonal, staff are friendly and polite. Whilst some rooms can be described as cosy (Small) they are all clean, comfortable and stylish. Some rooms can be noisy if the window is opened onto the one busy street adjacent to the side of the hotel. Very wide range of food for breakfast with fresh cooked egg dishes.The location is perfect for the British Museum, about 200yards (230 metres) and has good access to many of the Theatres by foot. Loads of small restaurants about and public transport is easily accessed."
79,1085,Jul 29 2009 	Thank you for another lovely stay.	Another overnight stay at this great hotel while visiting my mum and brother. Checkin quick and soon settled into room before seeing family. I stayed in a deluxe room which was of a good size but I do agree with comments that rooms do differ as I have experienced this for my self but was moved to a larger room when asked....I assume that would not have been impossible if their hadn't been one available so perhaps my views of this hotel could have been different. But I have to say that all rooms I have stayed in have always been well maintained and beautifully clean. TV has a wide choice of channels with good signal and the choice of movies fantastic......never had such a wide choice.The staff I have always found extremely friendly and helpful and nothing seems to much trouble. The position of the hotel is fantastic and if you were sightseeing everything is on your doorstep......something that you should be willing to pay for and compared to most central london hotels I feel the Bloomsbury is good value for money.I have eaten in the resturant once and it was great. I always have my breakfast sent to my room and I cannot fault this......a little added luxury that makes you feel even more special and the gentleman greets me like a long lost friend which is lovely.My brother and mum move from Gower Street soon but I will continue to stay at the hotel when visiting London. As a solo woman traveller I like to feel safe and secure and that is how I feel at the Bloomsbury
80,1085,"Jul 25 2009 	Great Great Great	This hotel is very nice one. Rooms are quite big, people very kind. It has a nice bar just behind (hopefully because no much pub or restaurant around). Internet is free of charge and breakfast are quite ok. No much to say : nice place to stay for business!"
81,1085,"Jul 24 2009 	Great Location	Stayed at Radisson Bloomsbury for 7 nights,outstanding location, staff fantastic, bar open till late, Internet free &amp; wickedly fast. 5 minute walk to Soho &amp; Covent Gardens. several restaurants within within 3 mins walk, Laundry across the road, Museum 200m up the road. highly recommended"
82,1085,"Jul 23 2009 	Excellent stay	Excellent stay, so clean and comfortable, all the staff were lovely and friendly, breakfast was delicious and so fresh, will definitely go back"
83,1085,"Jul 23 2009 	Lovely Hotel for !st Wedding Anniversary	Stayed here last weekend for our 1st Wedding Anniversay. The room was a fair size for London, clean and well priced. Breakfast was fantastic. Lots of varied choice but rather pricey at 17 per person. The location is superb and perfect for us. Literally a stones throw from the british museam. Can see it from the enterence of the hotel! Also about a three minute walk to Tottenham Court Road Station. Overall this was a great hotel. We are both in our 20's and would thoroughly reccomend this hotel to all and will be returning when we next stay in London."
84,1085,Jul 21 2009 	perfect location - nice hotel	I frequently stay in this hotel and choose it because of the the very good location as well as for London it has got quiet spacious rooms (not to be compared with US-standards). The staff is professional and friendly and after the renovation of the hotel last year you feel like home. I surely recommend this hotel.
