3,1698,Apr 7 2008 	Passable Pablas	This place was ok - the rooms were big but not necessarily clean - nicer than a hostel though. The staff were mostly helpful but quite rude if you weren't to take them up on their 'city taxi tour offers'. The buffet breakfast was ok but sometimes cold and not necessarily value for money. I was moved to a different room each night of my stay - so perhaps best just for one night stopovers!
4,1698,Mar 5 2008	Occupied despite credit card guaranteed reservation	We had made a reservation trough an internet booking agency (hotel.de) guaranteed by credit card. All rooms were occupied at check-in time. The obvious reason wasthat all individual reservations were cancelled to accomodate agroup of 20 people that arrived shortly later.
5,1698,"Feb 15 2008	Hot water please!	I returned from New Delhi, India on December 19, 2007 and I just wanted to give my overview of my 10 day stay in Hotel Pablas International. On the positive side, the staff there were very accomodating and friendly. The hotel itself had the basic amenities that you would expect in the US. There was Internet access, cable stations and shopping geared towards tourists. However, I thought that I would describe some of the differences that made our stay less than favorable. For one thing, we had to request new linen and that our room be cleaned. None of the staff really explained to us how room service worked. And after 3 days the room was in desperate need of attention. Another issue was the roach infestation on my first night at the hotel. When I couldn't tell whether or not we were in the roachs' room or he was in ours, I assassinated the creature and contacted the front desk. Soon thereafter, a staff person came to the room and simply threw the remains in the trash, nodded to me and left. I was too exhausted to debate the issue. Then, a couple of days later I saw another insect. And, I guess that other guests complained to the point that the hotel management decided to spray all of the rooms with a pesticide. This would have normally been good news except that none of the guests were warned about the indoor crop dusting and we nearly suffocated. Another thing to be cautious of is to know how much US money you are actually tipping taxi drivers or hotel staff. Unsavy foreigners can be tricked and duped if you don't negotiate carefully. Another good rule of thumb is not to give the women and children that surround the hotel any money or food unless you are prepared to be swarmed. You will quickly learn how to say nay nay. I was also unprepared for the surcharge for using the Internet. The last inconveince was to not know how long it would take to get hot water. This was my second trip to India, therefore, I was prepared to wait for hot water. But, we had so many problems with our hot water that we had to use the shower in another room. Last but not least, this hotel listed that it had a doctor on staff but after I woke up one morning with a golfball sized bump on my calf, I asked someone at the front desk about a doctor, I was told to try going to a drugstore and to get an ointment. Overall, this hotel was not that bad but there are some issues that can be understood and some that definitely need addressing. If someone asked me if I would recommend it, my answer would be not really."
6,1698,"Dec 19 2007 	Reasonably priced accomodation in New Delhi	At the beginning of a GAP Tour of Northern India, we stayed at Hotel Pablas International in Karol Bagh in New Delhi.The hotel's rooms are sparse and ours had no window. However, the room and bathroom were clean.The room was better than we expected and had a colour television with satellite and an air conditioner and fan.The fourth floor had a very good restaurant with very reasonably priced dishes, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Each day's charge includes breakfast.Located in one of the busiest markets in New Delhi, you can find anything you want by wandering around. But, the area is not the safest, so watch out for pick pockets.Overall, the hotel was reasonable."
7,1698,"Apr 17 2007 	Avoid this hotel	Luckily we only stayed for 1 night at this hotel. We paid 19 for the room but it was not worth the money. I lifted my pillow when getting into bed and discovered a cockroach underneath it! I then saw another scurrying across the floor! We moved rooms to one with only twin beds. There was no outside window which made the room very dark in the morning. There was only one dirty towel for me and my boyfriend to use. The bed linen had stains on it and holes in it and the shower could only be described as a dribble. There are lots of other hotels in the Karol Bagh area so look around, don't stay at the Pablas International!"
8,1698,"Oct 20 2006 	Cheats and abusive people who should not be in business	I had a very bad experience at Pablas International Hotel, Karol Baugh, Delhi. I was travelling to Delhi from Bangalore. And I booked this hotel from [-].in site by the credit card.I was charged $6/- for booking. 1) First of all, the booking had advertised that the hotel provides free pickup from the airport. The advertised pickup from airport is not there. After calling the hotel a number of times, they told me that I should take a prepaid taxi from the airport and they will refund me the prepaid taxi fare. I really dont know why the [-] in gives false information.2) When I landed at the hotel (and remember the rates at the hotel are close to Rs. 2000/- (around $40/- per night), II was taken to another hotel as this hotel seems to have been booked. I dont understand how the [-] and the hotel confirmed booking for me at the hotel, if there was no room. Some excuse was given that one client at the hotel who was supposed to leave fell sick.3) Finally the worst thing. They won't give you a proper receipt for the money paid. All they did was give a handwritten signature receipt. This is probably a con -- they are trying to save taxes4) At night 10 pm, one guy comes to ask for money for room stay. I refused to give him the money in the absence of receipt. Next day his boss comes to me and says that I abused the guy the earlier night. Further, the boss abuses me left, right and center.Further, the guy lectures me on how he has experience in worldwide hotel business. I travel widely and visit US every year, and there is no where in the world, they dont give receipts. He started saying that the &quot;money due' printout that I got via the web reservationitself is the receipt blah blah blah. The next day morning itself I changed my hotel.I dont know why these people are still in business when they treat customers this way.I suggest everyone avoid this hotel at all costs. regards,Dr. Samir KelekarBangaloreIndia.samir_kelekar@yahoo.com91-98450-44403"
9,1698,"Oct 8 2006	Good hotel	After booking on Expedia then seeing the other review, I wasn't looking forward to staying at this hotel. However, there was certainly nothing wrong with the room we got or the service we received.The deluxe room was just that....large, good bed, clean, working air con, satellite tv and running h&amp;c water.There were no cockroaches or bedbugs to be seen and the room was gleaming. They stored my bag (at no charge) while I toured India for a couple of weeks and arranged a taxi to the airport after I asked them to. There was no pressure to buy anything through them and the taxi came at the time I had asked for.It's not the Ritz, but it was a perfectly adequate hotel for the money. It's a 5 minute walk through busy Karol Bagh to the metro station and there are a million autorickshaws available to transport you to the sites.I'd stay here again without complaint."
10,1698,"May 30 2006	Avoid at all costs	It is a cheap hotel but there are so many cheap hotels in New Delhi it is easilly avoided. We paid for a deluxe city room and got a view of a wall but much worse than that, there were cockroaches everywhere, and i mean everywhere!!!! they lived under the bed and after moving rooms three times gave up in the end and counted the seconds until we could leave the place. Also, our flight was 4 in the morning so we had to pay an extra nights stay, we didn't want to leave until 1pm but at 12 middnight the men came to get our bags and they kept ringing and knocking the doors for us to get out. we then had to wait downstairs for an hour with another couple who had also paid to stay in the same bedroom that night while the cleaners quickly gave it the once over!!!! unbelievable. They also work extremely closely with a tour operator and it is just about impssible to have any peace unless you agree to pay them money for taxis and tours.AVOID!!!!!!"

1,1699,Oct 2 2009 	Nice place to stay	I had a nice and comfortable stay at this guest house. Rooms were clean and well maintained. Close to my Subway restaurant and Domizon Pizza. They take care of the guest and are trust worthy staff. Will visit again.
2,1699,"Sep 9 2009 	This is not a very good hotel with a location to match...	We previously stayed at the owners other guest house in Gurgaon, a suburb on the outskirts of Delhi for a friends wedding, but then we moved to this hotel to be nearer Delhi city centre.Good - The room was clean and a decent size, with a good size bathroom and also had air conditioning. - The owner Bobby was extremely helpful in answering any questions that we had.Bad - Although the hotel is clean it was very dark and dingy. - The staff do not understand and cannot speak much English making communication very difficult and time consuming. - The location of the hotel is too far away from the Delhi centre and the main sights. - There is nothing near the hotel in terms of night life; restaurants, bars etc. - We asked them to book a bus for us to Agra (as the train was fully booked) and they booked us onto a day-trip tour of Agra full of locals!OverallThis is not a very good hotel with a location to match."
3,1699,Nov 11 2008	People You Can Trust	We stayed for 12 nights in Oktober 2008 Everything we wanted was perfectley done We can recommend this guesthouse Good vallue for your money We just wanted a clean and safe place to sleep and that is exectley what Pamposh offers.ThanksHenk and Sytske NijlandHolland
4,1699,"Jul 11 2008	Great Location and Comfortable Stay	This is my second visit to Delhi and found this Guest House from their website. This is located in great, nice location. Surroundings have a nice green park, Dominoz Pizza, Subway and Ruby Tuesday Restaurants. Rooms are nice and fully western style with great service. Nice for family stay and teenagers. This is located in the shopping center, so no worries to travel for shopping."
5,1699,"Mar 4 2008 	Bad experience at this hotel	We came to the hotel with the intention of staying 2 nights but only stayed one night as we were very disappointed with its facilities and couldn't bare to stay longer. First of all, the hotel outside didn't even look like the picture I saw on its website. It had a small board with &quot;Pamposh&quot; written on it with a single door leading to narrow stairs up to the hotel reception area. We booked two double rooms. One of the rooms was on the top floor. That means we had to walk out through the balcony that had no roof in order to get to the room. As I was walking up the stairs (only had minimum lighting) to the top floor, I hit my head so hard as the concrete ceiling above the stairs was too low for someone of average height.Each room had a portable heater that was not enough to keep the room warm enough for the cold weather at the time we visited Delhi. Hot water was not available to our satisfaction as we would only get a bucket of hot water and then it would stop. You would then get only cold water. You have to wait a long time for the water to heat up before you get more hot water (they have a switch in the washroom that you need to turn on to heat up the water). The colour of the water was brown for the first 10 seconds after I opened tap in the shower. We complained about not getting enough hot water. One of the staff came to investigate, pretended like he was trying to fix it, left the room and never returned. It was late and we were tired after a long flight, so we just went to sleep with the strong intention of checking out next morning as early as possible. It was our first visit to Delhi and booking this hotel was a big mistake and booking it on the first night of our vacation was even a bigger mistake. If you are traveling with family/kids especially, don't stay at Pamposh. If you want a reasonable hotel in Delhi, don't book anything too cheap. If the price for the room seems relatively too low for Delhi, then don't go for it."
6,1699,"Oct 22 2007 	nice location new rooms	Hey i read the reviews in this website and wanted to take a chance to explore this place. Thx to Dimmy83 for updating the information of new rooms. Yes this place has new rooms with nice decoration, and i think its under new management and thats the reason all bathroom are new. I was lucky to get Super Dlx Room for Dlx Room price. stayed there for 3 nights, loved the location and my favourite Subway and TGI Fridays near by.Hope they continue with this maintainence and renovation.Thx Trip Advisor"
7,1699,"Jul 30 2007	Clean and looking forward for better after renovation	I got the information thru their website, it looked nice and clean.Paid advance amount to book the room and was sent confirmation ticket with 5% discount they offer for all customers online booking. Was picked up from an airport and came night 11pm. First encounter was street dogs barking, not near hotel but about 500 meters away from hotel, that made me little upset and scary. But things were better when reached the guest house. Guy helped to get my luggage, even though he did not understand english, but managed to understand whatever i said...SURPRISED ME...!!!!! I went to front desk and showed my confirmation ticket and was escorted to top floor room. Nice room looked newely rennovated and i was right...it was rennovated few weeks before. Bathrooms was absolutely clean with nice beige tiles and with nice band of decorative tiles to show elegent. Towels were new and liked their bathroom sleepers for walking around the room coz i forgot to get one along.In the morning, I was introduced to Mr. Vishal, Manager who was very nice and curtious and helped me to plan my day to go around Delhi. He gave me few tips to deal with auto rickshaws, shopkeepers for price bargaining...IT REALLY WORKED. Guest house is located in around nice restaurants like SUBWAY, DOMINOZ PIZZA. Across was a taxi stand and car mechanics working on denting, painting on cars. Well it did not borther me as its common in Delhi. First i was scared to find good place as told by my friend in USA. Power outage was a bit concerned since with the power backup A/C does not work only fans works...but was not long with power outage. Really liked the FREE WIFI Access.Planning to visit next year to see the newely renovated rooms."
8,1699,"Mar 20 2007 	Basic to the Floor rich and poor rub shoulders	I chose it from seeing their website and it was booked by our agent. It was a little bit too cheap.The Pamposh is-just as you see it, you get it: bedsheet spots- this would not be star rated at all in the UK, unfinished edges-Nice location in an allround way, the squalor is the one side; and right next to the poverty rubbing shoulders with the 'posh' part, is a good resid area, where there are a couple of modern yoga studios where people well off enough to employ the others as servants can go. The nearby taxi station lies beneath a tarpaulin tent roof, in the squalid market road corner with food vendors cooking up something vry unappealing. On the ground level of the guest house is a Dominoes pizza, that's okay, you can so easily walk it up to your own room.There is also a Paratha restaurant which is highly recommended in South Delhi, but not vegetarian - it smelt terriblt to me, like the outdoors squallor quite inescapeable for Delhi newbies. This is a S.Delhi heartland with modern shops nearby;the 24 hour ATM by the entrance is actually only a local bank card taker- so I was told; there is a delicatessen like 24-7 supermarket, where I saw organic soya milk, and many better quality Western brands, but unremarkably at western prices too. The much cheaper indian type of supermarket, as in the UK is also nearby. The entry (not for disabled/steep flight of stairs to reception) up between shops ( as pic.) S.Delhi noise resounds around here by day, hotel is no retreat; sound of aircraft only, at night, no worse than Earl's Court. Location of GK is not far from Nehru Place and Lotus temple. The bonus, if that is one. Internet wireless connection possible from bedroom by day/evening only. The odd electricity failure and sound of noisy background generator was timely also, but the worst thing was the lack of towel rails and coat hooks, which brought our the ugly workmanship and lack of decor, to make more obvious the odd tile missing in the bathroom, lack of room servicing- in terms of inspection and then necessary cleaning.If you want to respect and rub shoulders with those living here in poverty, without dangerous rides on rickshaws and an unhealthy interest in sweeping your feet through market areas, here's a better option, contain things to a manageable level within the hotel, and ignore it outside painlessly. Auto taxi into town, tour e.g. with our 'VacationExperts' good, in excellent car, much needed to fit all sites into a couple of days. Recommended if you want to put everything in the perspective of price, and a middle of the road viewpoint.Taxi call service very good, 300-400 IRs for a 4 hour/or 40km max journey distance. Eg Connaught place AND BACK in about 30 mins eachway, I day ( 6 hours) Vac Exp driver (and recommended guide extra) 800RPs/80km max. i.e. driver waits in car park, while you visit, paying entrance fees.erspective of price, and a middle of the road viewpoint."
1,1702,"Jun 19 2009 	Fantastic hotel	this is one of the greatest hotels we once ever lived from the whole world. especially Mr. Satyawan, an excellent manager who support and help us a lot during our first Indian trip."
2,1702,"Apr 30 2009 	very good location friendly and helpfull staff good rooms	I've been there twice during my india travels and the staff was really nice, friendly and helpfull. the location is a really good value. the hotel has a nice rooftop terrasse and the rooms are good value. If I'm going back to Delhi I would go there again."
3,1702,"Mar 31 2009 	Great value	I had stayed here before and totally loved it. I love that you can trust the staff and that they genuinely do all they can to help you.Hot water is not reliable here but I can bathe in tepid water no problem.I'm not fond of the room decor so I buy a pretty sheet, remove the drab spread and tuck it in the closet. I also reccommend you use your own towels. White towels become grey in India so fast and just never look or smell clean enough to me.I loved that they remebered me as soon as I arrived. And that was three years previous. Also most all the staff were the same an indication to me that the manager is treating them well.On this trip I met the owner. I simple lovely man.This place is a favourite even among middle class Indians. I love that you can meet locals here.In terms of the room - the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms have showers and buckets, but in ours the drain was too slow.The big plus is free wireless internet throught the hotel and a small fridge in the room!! There's also a TV with plenty of channels to watch. And you're in the heart of shopping heaven!"
4,1702,"Feb 5 2009 	Great service great value: Stay here!	I ha1ve stayed t 4 hotels in Delhi: One grotty one in Old Dlhi, one with cock roaches in Pahar ganj, one OK one in Karol Bagh, then I had a booking for Hotel Swati, but they were over booked. They recommended a nice clean hotel down the street: Rahul Palace. I have really enjoyed my stay here. The service is great, the breakfast service with a smile and the rooms very clean. They also have hot water 24 hours. If I came back to Delhi I would stay here again. Good value in a safe area. Because the agency that I booked under made a mistake Swati Hotel had recommended Rahul Palace. It was a very busy time and all the hotels were taken. One night I stayed in a room, the following night the owner gave me his own office (with bedroom area) to sleep in, free of charge! He said that if I didn't stay he would have to take me home to his family, because there were no rooms in the city. So ignore the bad reviews, if you want a place where the staff will look after you, wireless, clean rooms, hot water and happy staff come here."
5,1702,"Dec 4 2008 	Disgusting Stay Away!	Absolute rubbish, the electricity was not working in our room. Took 3 servants to fix this. There was poo in the toilet(!) and the stench almost made me spew up. And yet the had the pride to put a &quot;sanatised for your protection&quot; ribbon around the toilet and to make matters worse, the toilet wouldnt even flush. Two servants were sent up to attempt repairs and after four visits they could not get the toilet to flush. Also constant hammering noises as maintenance workers were fixing the hot water system at midnight. no hot water, very disgruntled, arrogant receptionist. requested another room and they agreed, but they called back later saying that all rooms have the same problem!! Checked out the next morning, and the receptionist said there was an additional service charge which he hadn't disclosed before when we confirmed the gross price the day before. We refused to pay the service charge and he didnt even give us a discount for our nightmare stay at this &quot;palace&quot;. A complete circus. STAY AWAY 0-stars!"
6,1702,"Nov 25 2008 	could be better	If you want to stay at this hotel, do it qiuckly before it falls apart.We stayed there for 4 days while on holiday in India. Although the communal areas like the corridors and the restaurant are OK, the rooms are very disappointing. You will find that some rooms don't have windows. They are clean but in urgent need of redecoration. I mean things like door handles falling of, broken showers, missing taps. The windows look like they have not been washed forever, especially the ones in the bathrooms. The main problem we thought was the state of the electic sockets-they are completely exposed hanging of the walls and impossible to use. When we changed to another room, it was just as bad.Having said that the staff at the hotel were very helpful and understanding so if you only need to be there for a couple of days I guess its good enough just don't expect a lot."
7,1702,"Aug 25 2008 	Dreadful ""palace""	We stayed in this &quot;Palace&quot; in February 2005 for one night, although we had booked for three. The memory still scars me which is why I have to see what others have written about this whenever I log on to a travel website. The hotel is completely off the tourist map. Our taxi driver had to stop and ask direction 3 times before he finally found it.The bed was made but the aircon was broken, as was the fridge, and the bed linen looked dirty too. The area is very noisy so we didn't get much sleep.We paid 35/night through a well-known website which used to give the hotel 3 stars, and now gives it 2.5 stars. 35/night is way too much for this place. Having stayed one night, we checked out at 6.00am in the morning and moved to another hotel."
8,1702,"Jul 16 2008	Real Delhi!	Great food, great terrace, great service, really nice cold A/C, clean rooms, the building is a little run down, but beautiful with marble floors, and this is typical of Delhi. The room and linens are kept clean. The shower sometimes runs cold, but it's not too bad in a place as hot as India. A great location in a busy colourful shopping district. Lots of fun, and a great helpful travel desk. AMAZING SERVICE!!!"
9,1702,Jun 18 2008 	Great place to stay!	Very clean and friendly people. Food is great and always made fresh. No bugs and the staff are constantly cleaning. The hotel has a great location in the middle of the Karol Bagh markets and close to the Metro station. Air conditioned rooms and free internet service. If I returned to Delhi I would stay here again and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone else.
10,1702,Mar 17 2008	people rahul hotel are very kind	In this hotel i have found people very kind that have tryd to make our stay comfortableBernarda olianas
11,1702,"Mar 9 2008 	Awful Experience!!	We contacted this hotel directly by phone and booked a room for 3 nights. We were told we would be picked up from the airport and driven to Hotel Rahul Palace, which was great because our flight arrived at 2:15am in a crazy city. No one ever showed up to claim us, we had to take a taxi to a phone to call the hotel and they claimed to have never heard of us or our reservation and they were currently full. They gave our room to another guest (probably for a larger amount of money) and left us stranded in a foreign city in the middle of the night. Shame on you Rahul Palace!"
12,1702,Jan 13 2008	Wonderful room great food and very friendly staff.	The room was very nice. The food in the restaurant was delicious and the staff was very friendly. We very much enjoyed our stay.
13,1702,Jan 1 2008 	rahul palace in karol bagh	Hotel expensive compared to many hotels of a similar quality but staff very friendly
14,1702,"Nov 6 2007 	Avoid - worst place i stayed in India!	This hotel is without doubt the worst place I stayed whilst in India - no hot water, and the room, bed and bathroom were all dirty. Another guest had money stolen from the safe whilst we were there, and we had a member of staff barge into our room without knocking whilst we were getting dressed for no reason. I was really glad to leave!"
15,1702,"Oct 20 2007 	Bed Bugs Scummy Management	Booked this hotel for a trip to Delhi through Expedia, do not believe what Expedia says about it. There is no pool, they will direct you to a nearby Public Pool, the sauna and steam room could not be located either... Although the rooms were advertised as suites the beds were only 6ft long (short for a European), and the rooms were of average standard- one of the two rooms we had had no window, and the a/c in both was very noisy. My bed had some sort of insects in it and I woke up with bites each morning. Bathrooms were ok, although hot and cold water was sporadic. The worst thing about the hotel however is the management, the two who staff the front-desk (one older guy, and a younger guy with glasses) were rude, obnoxious and grasping for any opportunity to make 10 Rs. more. On my check-in I was ignored, and the reception was generally unwelcoming. The hotel had no record of my reservation, although this could be Expedia's fault. The complimentary breakfast (in the reservation) was only grudgingly given following some discussion with the management.If you do stay there be warned that the map on their website is not very accurate and is difficult for taxis to find."
16,1702,"Sep 13 2007 	Truly Awful	I strongly advice against staying here. The rooms were very basic given the cost. There was no hot water for the entire duration of our stay, despite staff claiming on several occasions that it would be fixed. They were also quite aggressive in trying to sell us an overpriced tour. We weren't particularly worried by this at the time and paid by credit card when we left only to discover when we got home that they had processed the payment twice!!"
17,1702,"Aug 24 2007 	Good overall	The hotel is clean, and the staff extremely friendly. Rooms are simple but quiet, and shower was quite good. Interesting location, though print out map and make sure you have the telephone number as some of my taxi drivers had trouble finding it (there are hundreds of hotels in this area)."
18,1702,"Aug 23 2007 	Pleasant stay!	I found Hotel Rahul Palace by luck through hotels.com. I was glad that it is located on the same street as many other hotels in a busy market district. The moment I arrived my luggage was delivered from the taxi into the lobby. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful from the moment I checked-in until I the day I checked-out. It was clean and well-kept. The front desk agents provided me with detailed information on how to get around the city. To my surprise not a lot of guests utilized the roof top restaurant. I found their selection of American and Indian food to be very affordable and tasty. Although internet was available for guest use, only one was working inconstantly. My only suggestion for the hotel is to provide more reliable computers. Overall, my stay was pleasant."
19,1702,"Apr 24 2007 	Rahul a badly managed ""dhaba"".	I had been in contact with this hotel since three months regarding our stay at their hotel and also a trip of 10 days in Rajasthan.I exchanged mails with the administrative executive regarding our trip on a regular basis.Based on the mails I received I was getting the idea that this was going to be the best holiday I ever had even more because I was accompanied by my wife and daughter who were visiting India for the first time.The day of our arrival,time,pick up at the airport,our stay at Rahul while in Delhi ,our trip to Rajasthan starting from Delhi-Agra-Jaipur-Udaipur-Mt.Abu-Jodhpur-Bikaner-Mandewa-Delhi ,transport with a reliable driver,3 or 4 star hotels at all these places and our stay in Rahul for the rest of the days in Delhi before our departure from Delhi---these were all promised to me on paper and on the phone (I made the calls).The total price for the entire trip was calculated and I agreed.They promised us a qualis (jeep) to pick us up from the airport but a small indica (three adults and baggage) showed up.They promised us a triple occupancy presidential suite but what we got was a double room with a camping bed.Everytime we took a meal the waiter(s) would discourage us to charge to our room.They wanted us to pay in cash.I do pity the owner of this &quot;dhaba&quot;because his workers are literally stealing from his establishment.I HAVE PROOF OF THESE STATEMENT.I have already sent a mail to the hotel that I want to communicate with the owner directly.I also intend to send these things along with an offical complaint to ITDC,Min.of Tourism(india),Min.of Foreign affairs(Holland) and the Indian Embassy in The Hague.Evetually everything went WRONG from day 1.After 4 days in Delhi we were ready for our tour of Rajasthan--our means of transportation was changed (bigger car) we had to pay Rs.8000=00 extra.We were promised triple occupancy suits at all the above menyioned places.What we got were all double rooms without extra bed.In Jodhpur the driver brought us to a PG that is a Paying guest house instead of a hotel.***!!!!!!! Well finally our tour was over(thank god) and we came back to Rahul as pre-planned .Upon our arrival at the hotel they told us that we did NOT have a room.The room that we had booked 3 months ago was given away to somebody else.So we had to put all our baggage in a rickshaw and look for a hotel --all this after a very long and difficult drive from Mandewa.TO ALL FELLOW TOURISTS .PLEASE BE AWARE OF RAHUL HOTEL.I HAVE NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THIS DUMP.WAITERS AND THE RECEPTIONIST (CHEATS).YOU ARE WARNED.IF YOU WANT TO BE RIPPED,CHEATED,HARRASSED AND STOLEN FROM ===STAY AT RAHUL.If you wish proof of my statements mail me I will send you the names of the people you should be aware of in this dump.My trip was from 6 april--to--22 april.God were we happy to be back in Holland ."
20,1702,"Apr 15 2007	Misleading Descriptions Beware do not stay here	We recently stayed at this Hotel because of the description on a variety of websites. Dont waste your money there is no swimming pool, the air con tripped after 15secs of turning it on and the metal trip switch had to be turned on with a towel to avoid electrocution , the only window in the room looked out on to the stair well, no mini bar, taxes are not included if you pay directly to the hotel, the keys are not electronic, the towels are grey and linen had dubious stains, no free car parking (if you need to park then its out onto the street at your own risk) the elevator would not accomodate a wheel chair if you needed it. The travel desk / info consists of whoever is on the front desk that has a mate in a travel office (and there are a lot of them) who they call in to get their cut should you spend any money with them - complete sharks....! and this is after a long flight and taxi drivers with lost hotel syndrome who want to take you to their friends travel office to get you to book something so they get their cut too.....it goes on and on so you have to be on your toes....!"
21,1702,"Jan 25 2007	First hotel in India We stayed at	Was unpleasently suprised, but as we travelled around India started to realise this place wasnt as bad as it could be.Payed something stupid like 30 a night over the internet, DONT pay this much. You can get a much nicer hotel for less  in a better locatoin.Agree with the rest of the reviews about dodgy staff, but youll meet plenty of the type if you stay in delhi for a while."
22,1702,"Nov 6 2006 	Dodgy staff rip-off merchants	At ALL costs, avoid this Hotel if possible. Me and my friend stayed at this hotel for a total of 4 nights. It was the longest and worse 4 nights of my life. 1) Dodgy staff. 2) Lies. 3) Rip-off Merchants. 4) Over charged. 1) The staff at this dodgy propety are equally as sly as the rest of New Delhians BUT you expect differently considering you are paying for a service. As written on Expedia, the Hotel boasts free Internet. This IS correct but it comes at a LATER cost. When asking for internet at 9am, I was told that it wouldn't open until 10am and must wait. I had no problems with this. The next 30 minutes cost us $25 Australian Dollars. We went down windy streets only to find that we were going into a tourist shop. They wanted us to buy a tour but we weren't up for it. We finally were able to leave after using the internet . When arriving back at the hotel, the once nice lobby man gave us dirty looks. 2) When checking out of the hotel, we were charged for IDD calls to Thailand and China and un-used room service. (we assume it was because of us not purchasing any tours). DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL unless you ABSOLUTELY must/ enjoy getting ripped off."
23,1702,"Sep 1 2006 	I would rather stay in prison	This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The window opened into a dark aircon vent, the room was filthy and the sheets had clearly not been washed. This is a waste of money, don't stay here."
24,1702,"Aug 23 2006 	Scammers ! Travellers beware ! ""Palace"" is an exaggeration 1	I spent one night at this hotel after seeing their website where the pictures are good. Finding the place was very tough. The taxidriver drove around these little lanes asking people where this hotel was ... nobody seemed to know it.They overcharged me for the room and the food. To make matters worse they took another 3% for credit card payment.  The room was disgusting, the bed falling apart and the employees were totally useless. This place was a nightmare. Never again."
25,1702,"Aug 17 2006	Clean. Safe. Decent location.	Got a room for about $20/day through Expedia. Very clean room and bathroom. It felt safe - both the surrounding area and hotel itself where I kept my suitcases (ie, I didn't feel as though someone would steal my stuff). Bathroom with Western toilet and hot shower. They even gave me a free daily newspaper.Great service. My flight got delayed by one day. They still honored my prepaid reservation for the next day.Location is ok. About 10min by auto rickshaw from Connaught place. About 5min walk from their subway/train station."
26,1702,"Aug 1 2006 	Terrible	Terrible. They cheated us with the room and give us another room, they charged for the water 10 times more than normal. Watch out, better keep away of this property! It is the worst hotel Ive stayed in. Please beware. Bad neighborhood too far from everywhere, taxis dont know the zone. The most awful 'hotel' we have ever seen. It was clear that the owners and staff had no training within the hotel trade and had no pride in the product they offered."
27,1702,"Apr 26 2006	Nice Facility Terrible Management	I recently spent a week at the Rahul Palace Hotel. The hotel itself is in good shape and in a reasonable location, but the awful staff prevent me from wanting to send any business in their direction.Things started off really badly. I had arranged to be picked up from the Domestic Terminal but my flight was delayed three hours so I was only somewhat surprised there was no one there to meet me. I called the hotel and they first suggested I take a taxi. I read about how difficult the place was to find and I wasn't completely comfortable taking a taxi by myself at 11 PM, so I told them to send a car to come get me like I had requested. They told me the driver would be there in 25 minutes. They also provided me with the driver's phone number. I called that too but it was the wrong number, so I had to call the hotel again. They then gave me the right number, but it was mostly useless as the driver hardly spoke English. I waited about 45 minutes and called both the driver and the hotel again. Both told me to wait a little longer and the guy was on his way. Several phone calls later we discovered the hotel sent the driver to the international terminal which is quite a distance away. In the end I waited 90 minutes and spend an obscene amount of money using my cell phone to call these people. The driver also managed to lose the ticket for the parking lot and spent several minutes arguing with the official at the gate. When I arrived at the hotel, the guy at the desk told me to pay the driver 600 rupees. When I made my reservation they quoted me a price of 450 rupees, so I was not liking the feeling of being scammed from the get-go. I refused to pay anything since I had to wait so long and spend so much money in phone calls. The guy at the desk said I should take it up with the manager in the morning.The manager, if that who he actually was, was entirely unsympathetic and found my situation rather humorous. I was unpleased and he didn't want to reimburse me for my airport pickup. Later when I asked them to call a taxi, they just used one of their own over-priced (I realized this later) cars to take me where I needed to go. They were clearly just interested in making money for themselves and not serving their customers' interests. When I had to go back to the airport two days later for my sister's arrival, I had the same terrible driver as the first time. The only positive experience from this trip was there was no charge for me riding along. The driver stopped for food on the way and only turned on the AC when I asked. At the airport he tried to get me to pay for him to enter the terminal, which I refused since it was completely unnecessary. Then he made me pay for the airport parking, which he said the hotel would reimburse. Back at the hotel, I gave the driver a 500 rupee note, wanting 50 rupees in change. He didn't have it so the hotel said they'd bring it up to my room, along with the 60 rupees for the parking. A few minutes later only the 50 rupees arrived. It took another try with the manager to get all my money back. These people are so frustrating!!As for the hotel itself, like I said, it's very nice. There is free, but slow internet in the basement. Beware, the power goes out frequently, which knocks out the computer. There is a generator, but you need to start all over again. The room was clean, the bathroom was decent, and the AC was powerful, though loud. The bed sheets looked clean, though had some holes and weren't really large enough for the bed. They put a single sheet length-wise across a double bed for some bizarre reason. We only got actual hot water once, but we didn't mind to much since it was so hot outside. The food from the restaurant was excellent and can be delivered to your room anytime of day or night for no charge! The neighborhood of the hotel is quite busy at all hours which made it feel safe, but without being noisy at all. The Karol Bagh metro station is about two blocks away and is an easier destination for taxis and autorickshaws once you know where the hotel is since it's on a narrow sidestreet that they can't seem to find.Basically, if you're hard up for a place to stay, Rahul Palace is great and the price (assuming they honor it) is good. I don't want to recommend them, however, because the service was awful and they seem to want to fleece their customers."
28,1702,"Apr 24 2006	Not bad at all!	I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights as a single female traveller. I liked the place although it wasn't perfect. There was only warm water, not hot (not big deal, just don't run the cold one). I would prefer the towels bit more white instead of grey, but.... for the money I would stay there again. After all, I only spend there nights, was out all day everyday. I had one meal at the hotel's restaurant. It was good enough, but the service was a bit slow for my liking. Everybody at the hotel was nice and helpful, could smile a bit more though."
29,1702,"Apr 14 2006	Not Worth the Money! This Hotel Provid Terrible Service	I am writing this review as I made my decision to stay in this place based upon the review comments here. I am highly disappointed on the review comments in favor of Hotel Rahul Place, and I start suspecting if these review comments are REAL after staying in this hotel. I dont think it is Hotel! But a cheap motel, located in Karol Bagh a very busy business place.I would have not written this review, if I paid Rs500 for a night at hotel Rahul Palace, which i think is worth for stay. I paid $30 + Rs 700 to travel to and from the Airport to this so called 3 start facility. This pinch me a lot now. I should have not took a chance and shall have found a reasonable place to stay even though bit more expensive. If I would have known this before, i would have not spent on this place I spent almost $45 US (Hotel + Taxi. The worse thing was traveling in taxi for 3 hours from 12:30 AM to 3:30 AM after 23 hours of travel from USA to India to find the damn &quot;Rahul Palace&quot; I would have happily spent $145 to be safe and secure. I could not even take a shower with hot water.I started at 12:30 AM from the Airport took a paid taxi to the Rahul Palace on Main Ajmal Khan Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi. Driver drove on Main Ajmal Khan road for 20 minutes and could not find. Someone told us that we shall look for Rahul Palace in WEA, then we started looking for WEA arae, asked locals no one knew about the place Hotel Rahul Palace. It was scary place at night time, I thought Ill be mugged. I lived in India but I was honestly scared as majority of the people we met were drunk and some were sleeping on the streets, cars, Rikhsas, may be a good place during day time but not at night. Especially if you are traveling with female I would not recommend this place at all, area wise. After a long struggle we found the damn Rahul Place which was very hidden inside the unplanned thickly populated urban area, where address does not mean anything to locate physically a facility, I am sure mail will not be a problem but for a stranger it is not easy. I dont know why I spend so much time for $30 to find Rahul Palace, when I could have found better place to stay by spending another $30 in the same area, not i prefer this area. I saw some good places to stay near the airport, when i started the journy to Rahul Palace. Somehow hotel is not that famous as the WEA which I later found out is a showroom of same size a typical Seven Eleven about (3000 sqft). The idea is to tell you how misguiding the ranking could be when we try to search through the internet.Finally, I ended up at the motel and staff was OK, helpful, took my stuff to my room. Room was small, AC was making more noise than cooling the room, I had to turn on the fan to cool, TV was OK, and Hot Water was just dripping! Pressure of cold water was so slow I had to spend five minutes to properly drain ---- from the toilet!!!!! Bed sheets were sub grade as per hotel industry probably cleaned once a month and not fresh every time a new customer takes room! Hotel towels were soiled. I ended up using my persoanl towel which luckliy i took with me! Hot water was almost none existing and water pressure was terrible, took five minutes to fill one bucket to take shower with cold water! Forget about shower with hot water!!!Good thing was food, Hotel provided me Dal and Roti, which was decent and very quick. I was Hungary so food tasted very good! Relatively less noise on the street from street traffic as i was supsteing since room was alomst next to street. Staff Person at the reception desk in the morning was discourteous probably was son of the owner had &quot;do not care attitude&quot; I did not feel like I shall tell him to fix hot water. They did ask me to fill customer satisfaction form, which I did with &quot;no care attitude&quot; like the front desk person and tell them the in writing how terrible was the stay. Conclusion: Ill not stay in the hotel in future, but would rather spend more money if required and find a reasonable place to live. I would not recommend this place for single womens (especially westeren women) or even people with family especially if you are checking in at the middle of night. Typically all of us end up in Delhi around 10:00 Pm as most of the flights end up reaching Delhi around 10:00 PM.I disagreed with some of the previous review comments that place is good place to live per Indian Standards and value for money, I think Indian Standards have raisin a lot, especially when it comes to value for money spent. I dont think it applies here, as I wrote before I would pay Rs 500 and stay a night at Rahul Palce and will not be feeling ripped off. I strongly suspect that the review comments about Hotel Rahul Palace are somehow manipulated by the Hotel Owners as they are more favorable than they shall be based upon my experience after staying one night. Also I think, India shall set up a standard system to know hotel ranking as we know that Best Western, Comfort Inn, Holiday Inn is economy, Super 8 Motel is double economy and Radisson, Hyatt, Marriot is luxury and places like Rahul palace are probably fit below motel and shall be considered super economy.Hope this helps! I was not thinking to write this I thought their will be more people like me looking for input to stay at reasonable price in return for reasonable service. I stayed in all type of Hotels from $30 to $490 per night as I travel a lot for business. I always try to find a reasonable priced night stays, even though my company have high upper limit, if I spend more than $400 per night stay then I have to write an explanation note, but still my expense will be approved. Hope this review will help your future stay in Delhi. I booked my hotel through Hotel and thought the place will be reasonable, so be careful with the big name Websites Marketing tools. Websites like Hoetl, Priceline, and Expedia do not inspect/check and approve facilities; you are at your own risk. My personal opinion is that chain hotels do check standards before they give them business name, in this case no names, like Rahul Palace ends up in comparison with others named hotels and we get illusions that they provide same or better service but they dont."

I and my sister ware little hesitant as we have seen few movies like the Slumdog and were so confused about the palace and india. We wanted to stay in delhi only for the week and a day trip to agra. We were picked up on time, the reception even helped us to get the mishandled baggage. We impressed with their knowledge of English. We travelled delhi, agra and jaipur with their assistance. There hotels at all the places were excellent. The hotel just has one bad thing that is location but as you get in there it is right.ThanksJ. Desuza &amp; family."
4,1704,Nov 25 2009 	TheGamePlay	This hotel was situated in Karol Bagh. The hotel Staff was badly trained and always try to cheat and on first night they stole my watch from my bag. I was scaring and feeling unsafe there. As I have to stay 5 nights so I change my program and shifted to another hotel in karol bagh. I recommend others to avoid this place.
5,1704,"Nov 24 2009 	Really We Enjoy With This Service	I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for two weeks. This hotel is simply the best in delhi - Service: - the service is professional and totally client-oriented. Cleanliness and Hygiene: - the hotel is literally spotless. From the sheets to the seats on the rooftop terrace, everything is squeaky clean. Quality: - the food prepared is delicious. Facilities: - I had the pleasure of inaugurating the newly renovated room. In keeping with the rest of the hotel, the service is professional, value-for-money, clean and deeply pleasing."

Great price for great location. just rite outside of hotel are the few tea house. Room is clean and nice, big enough to lay your luggage on the floor for packing. Towels change everyday with nicely clean up in the room. Guess they have done something to the clear windows from bathroom after some reviews previously which currently allow some privacy if you are traveling with friends. The hotel lobby is equipped with computers for your use that are at no cost, very friendly staffs. Everyone are so friendly, even the cleaner who clean the room. They greeted us with smiles which makes your day."
11,1704,"Nov 17 2009 	Thank You	The reception on check in told us that they book train trips also on good cheap and we arranged one meeting in evening. I went with my husband to Connaught place and met a man in restaurant who speaks good French. After some time when we told about our plans he offered to take us to his friends office (travel agent) to give us good package, he also paid for our coffee. We paid 1500 Euros for the tour and came out but later realized that we paid almost the double for trip. My husband wanted to go back to France and said. India is all cheater. I told reception about this and they asked their manager to come. He helped us a lot and coved this cheater to give our money back; I must thank them for all their help. Now we know that not every body is bad. Hotel is good, best is staff that helps you out of the way"

25,1704,"Jul 22 2009 	A Place Feel Welcome	A very pleasant budget-priced hotel for the midrange traveller. It has a good location close to shopping streets, two minutes from the Karol Bagh metro train station; and is nestled in a quiet back street away from traffic noise. The rooms are comfortable and clean, with overhead fans and the obligatory air-conditioners (if only through-the-wall models). The staff are attentive and very accommodating, no doubt led in that example by Mr. Dua, the Raunak's avuncular hotel manager. He made me and my partner very welcome and did everything to make our stay as pleasant as possible. I met the hotel owners who were similarly inclined toward their guests - in particular the very personable Pushpa, who went out of her way to organise our train journey around the North of India. She dedicated a good amount of time organising hotels and train bookings, ever mindful of our need to keep costs down. As a result, we had an adventurous whistle-stop tour, trouble-free thanks to her efforts. I would recommend the hotel to anyone, and both my partner and I thank all the staff for treating us like special guests."

28,1704,"Feb 12 2009 	Terrible expirience!!!!	What ever happens, do not book this hotel. This is a terrible hotel and would never stay there again, even if it was free. We arrived at this hotel, which is set in one of the backstreets of Delhi. The location of this hotel was set in the middle of a local shopping complex, and the photos advertised did not at all reflect the hotel. The staff at Raunak Plaza, were what I could best describe as a amateurs and had no training in how to treat guests or run a hotel which made my wife feel really uncomfortable, they could hardly speak a word of English. The hotel is effectively still a building site. We booked on the basis that it was a new hotel, and all facitilies would be comfortable and clean. It was less than uncomfortable. The rooms were dirty with damp on the walls, and for a new hotel, the place was pretty much falling apart. The other problems were that due to the building work, and the surrounding area where the hotel was there was ton of Mosquitoes and constant noise day and night. We asked to change rooms 3 times, due to the fungi growing on the floor and walls, and the uncleaniness. The shower water flooded the entire bathroom.The hotel was advertised with a Rooftop Terrace and restaurant, when we arrived, this was still being built, the service advertised was not there. The hotel building work meant the drilling and the work started at 5am in the morning, and continued until 22.00pm at night. We ordered some coffee from room service whilst we were there, and once we finished drinking we asked the room service to come and collect it, they came, and took it out of our room, and left it outside our front door for the whole of the next day. Fly's were swarming the tray.The hot water in the hotel was non-exisitent. After a long flight, we wanted to have a shower and freshen up, but had to wait nearly 2 hours after constant complaining to reception and still had no hot water, so we ended up with cold showers. The very next day we decided to check out, we left at 6.30am, there was no hot water to have a shower in the morning. When checkout time came, we went downstairs to reception, and the staff were sleeping in the lobby of the hotel, there was nobody to serve us, and when we woke one of them up, he got out of his &quot;sleeping bag&quot;, and with a terrible appearence served our check out. We checked out after one day, and sacrifised the cost. Please check out our photos first. Many other guests in the hotel, which we spoke to voiced the same concerns."

2,1709,"Nov 10 2009 	Excellent service	We spent a night in the ITC Welcome Sheraton earlier this week having stayed at several different hotels in Delhi and in Agra during our visit. The Sheraton was without doubt one of the best hotel we stayed in (see review on Intercontinental Eros Place). One piece of advice, be sure to print out the full name and address of the hotel before you travel, as there are several Sheratons located in different parts of Delhi and drivers get really confused.We booked a king bed room on non-smoking floor and we were pleased to be informed upon arrival that we were upgraded to a club room and we were promply brought to the club floor lounge for happy hour drinks and snacks while we checked in. The hotel and our room was modern, clean and well-equiped, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The selection and quality of food in the hotel was surprisingly good. We will definitely stay there again next time in Delhi."
3,1709,"Nov 3 2009 	Sheraton was the best part of our trip to New Delhi	The best part of our stay in New Delhi was the Sheraton hotel. It was the only place in New Delhi where we were treated like royalty and not stared at constantly because we were Indian Americans.; we actually felt welcome. The amenities are a plus with a Spa and beautiful pool. The complimentary breakfast buffet was amazing with international cuisine. The room was clean and the bathroom was the best out of all the ones we had encountered through our tour of India. The staff was very kind and attentive from the minute we arrived at the airport until our departure . In fact at our departure we were lucky enough to have a representative of the Sheraton, Manoj Kumar who was with us every step of the way as Air India gave us a very difficult time with our luggage and its weight. His quick thinking and experience allowed us to receive a minimum charge of 50% of what Air India wanted us to pay originally. We were grateful for our stay in the Sheraton because it ensured a smooth visit. We will definitely be back. :)"
4,1709,"Sep 20 2009 	Modern comfortable hotel	Very comfortable, clean rooms, spacious and modern bathrooms, I enjoyed my stay at Sheraton almost 100%. Very helpful staff, good buffet for lunch.Draw backs: There was the smell of fresh paint in the floor. Internet charge IR 700 per 24 hours."
5,1709,Sep 15 2009	excellent service staff	i celeberated my birthday in this hotel the staff were prompt and effecient and they were brilliant in every aspect the birthday cake was yummy and beautiful prepared by thier lady chef. and the location of this hotel is great especially if u r a foodie and shopahlic and movie buff. i have no doubt to say they have best malls around walking distance in india yes in india.and people in this part of delhi r genuine and honest if u compare with other parts as it is located in elite part of southdelhi. which isconsidered to be themost affluent part . though for tourist it may be a bit far from tradional tourist spots but i must say it worth a shot. i hope u will enjoy a great service from thier staff as i did.
6,1709,"Aug 27 2009 	Perfectly acceptable but not outstanding accommodation	I'm willing to admit, my judgement of the Sheraton New Delhi has been clouded somewhat by glorious stays in other properties managed by the ITC Welcomgroup in India, (also operated under the Sheraton franchise), so this place was going to have to do a lot to really stand out! My employer selects, and pays for, my accommodation when I travel, so I can't comment on the value of the nightly rates, or how they compare with other hotels in the chain. The Delhi property, while maintaining a high overall standard of both accommodation and service, seems lacking in a few of the 'little things' which can really make a stay, and which differentiate other properties in the group. First off, the 'Sheratonisation' process seems to be continuing apace! I understand that having the backing of a huge, well-respected and popular brand is of great value to both the group and their customers, but the small differences which gave the Indian hotels more of a 'local' feel seem to be disappearing, to be replaced by the generic 'Sheraton' model. This isn't a huge thing, I know - and indeed, some might welcome the familiarity - but I always used to enjoy the seemingly 'exotic' bathroom ameneties made in India and the like! The public spaces of the hotel have a modern feel which, apart from the ever-smiling doormen bedecked in their traditional outfits, could almost be anywhere in the world. The rooms themselves are what I have come to expect, with high ceilings, lots of dark wood and plenty of wardrobe space. I am sure some will think me picky, but the standard of the rooms here in Delhi are not as high as elsewhere, (and I'm comparing a regular, non-executive floor, non-marvellous view type room here!) Again it's the little things. The mini-bar - which I never use, I'll admit, and often empty straight away to restock with my own bits and pieces - looks like it hasn't been attended to in a while and is practically empty. There is one glass to drink from and, unlike at other Sheratons in India, no swizzle sticks, straws, coasters etc. There is no iron or ironing board in the room, and I suspect this is common across the board, (so to speak!); while a quick call to housekeeping will sort this out, it would be handier if there was an iron to hand for when you need it!The bed is huge and comfortable, so no complaints there, (and after all, isn't that the most important thing?!), plus there is a cosy two-seater sofa with a coffee table, which gives an idea of the size of the room. Flatscreen TVs seem to have appeared since my last visit, (not a big draw for me personally, but everyone seems desperate to get the things in their rooms these days!), and there are three telephones in the room and bathroom, so you've no excuse to miss a call! The workdesk area is organised in a corner layout, which makes it easy to use. International visitors will also appreciate the 'multiplug' sockets in the room, (I have spotted two!), which seem to cater for all of the various plugs from around the world, (though check on the voltage first!) There's one by the workdesk, and another beside the bed, so handy for charging the mobile overnight!The bathroom is, comparatively, quite small. It is however very pleasant and loaded up with ameneties. The shower is over the bath in this room, unlike at other properties which feature a separate shower. There are plenty of mirrors throughout both the room and bathroom, so if the lighting at one doesn't work for you then another will! Service at the hotel is not as gracious as I have come to expect from Sheratons in India. I'm not expecting - and never appreciate - staff falling over me, but it is quite common to pass by staff in the hallways and for a pleasantry offered not to be returned, or for a smile not to be reciprocated. It's not that thay are being rude; it's just that I have come to expect and appreciate a smile from time to time! Equally, the concierge, while accommodating and obliging, seemed somewhat unenthusiastic and requests from myself and colleagues were met but with little good grace!I am sure there are worse places to stay at, even within this price bracket. What is disappointing, is that I KNOW this could all be done so much better, (and is being achieved elsewhere in the ITC Welcomgroup chain!) As I say, I've been spoiled somewhat by previous experiences elsewhere; a bit more effort and the Sheraton New Delhi could easily match, and exceed, these experiences."
7,1709,Aug 7 2009 	Great Decor. Great Service	The ambiance at this hotel is great. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful. The helped plan my entire stay in Delhi.Great Place to be.
8,1709,"Jun 13 2009	obtain good directions(possibly to another hotel)	Imagine driving down from District Kangra(on a good day, about 15 hours), having a heat stroke in Chandigar, both your drivers having a good command of English and Hindi, arriving on outskirts of Delhi and they call the hotel to obtain directions. Then, over two hours later, apparently due to misdirection from hotel staff, finally arriving, Delhi traffic notwithstanding. The room(and amenities like slippers, robes, etc)reserved for two is prepared for one. The SPG lounge insists on beverage service for only one guest even though there are clearly two in the party. On check-out and preparation to airport the first vehicle in the line is clearly not suitable. Finally when speaking with SPG Guest Services back stateside you are told that the hotel provided you with complimentary transportation tot he airport, clearly not the case.On the plus side, luxurious public areas and sumptous brunch buffet-a real effort to &quot;regain the confidence of the guest,&quot; somehow falling through. Somewhat of a departure from the usually excellent Sheraton/SPG customer service."
9,1709,"Jun 9 2009 	Very good Hotel	Nothing to say about the hotel staff, the rooms and the amenities, as everything was perfect.We didn't triy the restaurant and breakfast, but the only neagtive thing is the location...It's a little bit outside of the center. If you need transportation, just take a rickshaw outside of the hotel and never ask for a taxi, as the taxi is going to rip you off.Going back to the hotel can also be problematic, but fortunately, there's a larg shopping center just around the corner of the hotel, so just indicate the &quot;City Select Mall&quot; in the Saket Disctrict to go back to the hotel.The mall is also a heaven of peace in Dehli. Don't go there for shopping, just for the air-conditioning and peacefull place!"
10,1709,"May 22 2009	Very nice stay	Had a great time staying and visiting Agara too.,"
11,1709,May 11 2009 	A great memorable experience	An excellent property at a decent location in New Delhi. It is a Five star property - so the usual five star facilities are available. What I recall best is the quality of food at the restaurant and range of liquor. It has an excellent check-in &amp; check-out facility.
12,1709,"May 9 2009 	Loved the Food	I stayed at Sheraton New Delhi during business trip and found it to be absolutely wonderful experience with great food choices-North Indian, South Indian and really good Asian variety. On top of food variety, the hotel staff was extremely sensitive to the guests needs which made the experience even better."
13,1709,May 4 2009 	Above average!!!!	The hotel is ok in all the senses. Only thing that makes it a bit difficult that the staff members do not have enough experience to deal with esteemed travellers. The ambience of the hotel is good and amenities are acceptable.
14,1709,Apr 28 2009 	Could have been better	My experience was not that great as per my expectations. This was my 3rd visit to the same place and after giving constant feedbacks in my previous stays i thought they woudl take extra care of the little things that were missed previously. but to my surprise nothing much was done. Things like giving a non-smoking room even though you mentioned that you want a smoking one. It was terrible hearing the fire alarm go on and then seeing everyone gather outside your room. The food could have been a little better. Bell boys efficiency is anothe rthing for them to look at. Overall i would say that i was satisfied but not delighted with my stay.
15,1709,"Apr 28 2009 	Good Business Hotel	I've stayed at the Sheraton, New Delhi several times over the last few years.I would rate it as a first class business hotel. It has a very good range of restaurants for the discerning business traveller.The service levels are on par with the best business hotels in India.The rooms are clean, hygenic with all the regular frills that one is used to in a sheraton hotel.On the whole, a good enjoyable experience, though definitely a trifle more expensive than a Lemon Tree."
16,1709,"Apr 17 2009 	bad reception	It was bad experience at reception, As per contract I can have two breakfast &amp; I avail the same. However at the tiome settling bill recpction was unaware about this . It was very bad time at reception."
17,1709,"Mar 29 2009 	Ok but could do better	Stayed for 3 nights at the end of a weeks business in Punjab. Upgraded to exec floor as we like the convenience of the lounge and extra facilities. Rooms were well finished in a traditional style with a very good stock of amenities. Good room and night service with home made biscuits and fruit daily. Large bathroom again well stocked.First night arived very late and ate in the buffet 'Bay Watch' restaurant. Not recommended, despite it being marketed as 24 hr the food was past it's best, the staff were not that attentive or helpful and the grill chef quite surley. Complained to general manager during our stay and had the food bill refunded.Pool staff were very good and nice area to sit and relax (may near ear plugs for traffic - thats just Delhi)Also the exec lounge is fairly small both breakfast and afternoon canapes were very poor. I asked for a boiled egg on the first morning only to be told hot items were not available in the lounge. I later found that this was not true and hot items could be ordered. Also we found staff being more concerned about what was on the TV than tending to guests.I do like the Sheraton group and am heartened that my complaints to the manager did receive prompt attention, this would cause me to come back again but I do think they need to check on how there business is being delivered to the customer."
18,1709,"Sep 20 2008 	Stay here whatever you do	I have travelled India a lot. Stayed in one star to 5 star hotels sometimes regretting the outrageous costs for little return. But not here, this hotel and it's highly trained super friendly staff border on over servicing. I have long been used to indifferent service and staff that bordered on insubordinate.The Sheraton New Delhi surpassed my most optimistic expectations in all areas and to boot the food was nothing short of amazing. Dont miss this place if you can afford it. Then on the other hand, can you afford to miss the experience?The hotel managers name is Rishi. This man will ensure your stay is one to remember."
19,1709,"Sep 18 2008 	Wonderful experience	I've spent nearly 3 weeks a month here in this hotel since August 08. Great hotel with real 5 star facilities. Staffs are extremely friendly. Though lacking of restaurant and connected shopping center, you could still get to one of the biggest mall in Delhi in less than 5 mins cab ride. If you are a SPG gold member, you can even get a free room upgrade and late checkout at 7 pm!!! Obviously I got that ..."
20,1709,"Aug 12 2008 	OK but there are much better '5 starts' in India	I have to say I was somewhat disappointed with my stay here. While there was nothing serious that went wrong, I was just left underwelmed. The property is looking a bit tired, the rooms also. The staff were poilte but not the usual attentive lot that I usually find in India. I' ve stayed at better hotels in Delhi. On a positive note, room service breakfast was very tasty and served very promptly."
21,1709,"Jul 28 2008 	Nobody Gives You India Like Sheraton	I just got back from a business trip in Delhi, India and spent most part of the week in Sheraton Hotel, Saket, New Delhi. The hotel is above average, the facilities are good, the location boggles me, but the service is excellent. I stayed there for three nights checked out for another night then checked back in for another three nights. When I checked back in, they saw the feedback I left for them during my first stay and did what they could to make my experience better. The bed and bath linens were clean and plentiful. I wasn't a big fan of the pillows they had in my room, but they offered a pillow bar where I could choose pillows based on what my preferences were. For some days, I switched the Privacy switch on and Housekeeping called me at least once to confirm that I didn't want to have my room cleaned. I got a king size bed, and I paid INR 7300++ (lots of taxes!) for the bed, the big bathroom, a couch and a work-table. Unfortunately, I was out for business for most part of the week so I wasn't able to appreciate the facilities of the hotel. My room didn't come with a view but I doubt it would have been any different anywhere else in the building. The room comes with complimentary breakfast, but for someone who has been into buffets at Sofitel (Spiral) and Shangri-la (Circles) in Manila, the selection paled in comparison. If you're looking to travel elsewhere watch out that you don't plan your day to early, breakfast doesn't start until 7am. As hotel prices go, the prices for in-room dining are limited and steep. Food quality and serving sizes are pretty good though.Overall, I'd say it's a good hotel to stay at. I'd recommend it to anyone travelling for who and what's in it, but not for where it's at."
22,1709,"Jan 10 2008	nice but could do better	First of all the hotel is okay just not great, dont hesitate about staying there but there is better available. We needed to book last minute because of a change of plan and needed an overnight near the airport, so I checked trip advisor for recommendations. The hotel stated it is 30 minutes from the airport, which is why I chose it, but it took us an hour! However it was still wonderful to pull up to this oasis from the abominable Delhi traffic. Booked with [--] 14,000 rupees per night for 2 executive rooms inclusive of drinks, hors douevres 5-8pm and breakfast. We arrived at 7:56pm and unfortunately were no longer entitled complimentary drinks etc which was a little annoying.Rooms are spacious and great beds but a clock somewhere would be nice. Although we had two rooms booked only one had the upgraded amenities, fruit, chocolates etc. It may seem a little sexist to the west but as female travellers it was nice to be on a female only floor.Probably the worst part of the stay was the restaurant Pan Asian. The dcor is dated. The cooking stations are not adequately ventilated which resulted in making our eyes sting and cough from the fumes, we couldn't wait to get out. The food was sloppy, tasteless and over priced. My local takeaway is superiorBuffet Breakfast in the lobby is 7-10:30 with a wide variety available, although by 10am most options were empty and not refilled. I asked for poached eggs and was told it would take 10 minutes, after 40 minutes they hadnt arrived and we left.Stay at the oberoi. Its better, cheaper and you have an inclusive luxury airport transfer."
23,1709,"Nov 27 2007 	Good balance of price location niceness	Sheraton New Delhi was our first hotel experience in India. The room was large, comfortable and clean, although the carpet was dated and for some reason always seemed damp. The bathroom was huge and nice. The front desk staff were great - very helpful in giving advice about obtaining taxis, etc. Food was fine - standard buffets but with a wide variety of options. The location turned out to be fine. It's close to a couple significant sites that we may not have otherwise made it to (Q'tab Minar and Humayun's Tomb), but if I return I may pay the extra money to stay closer to the city center. We did not get to do much walking around b/c it's too far to walk to Connaught Place (or other sites in that area), and the taxi ride can take a while when traffic is bad (took over an hour one evening to get home from CP). Overall, I'd stay here again if I was planning a few days in New Delhi, but for a shorter visit, it may be more fun (though louder and definitely more expensive) to stay closer to the city center."
24,1709,Nov 19 2007 	new delhi hotel sheraton	I had a great stay in sheraton new delhi it is one of the finest hotels in delhi ..... simply super.....
25,1709,"Oct 12 2007 	Good hotel but far away from the action	I stayed for a night at the Sheraton. The hotel is around 30 minutes from the airport and is located in a quiet residential area of Delhi. Check-in was smooth and the room was excellent. The hotel itself is well maintained. I was on a business trip and would recommend this hotel for people on business, but not necessarily for tourists. There's really not much to see in Saket and it's a bit of a trek to get to the interesting spots."
26,1709,"Sep 12 2007 	Great hotel	Beautiful hotel, the rooms are spacious and well equiped and furnished. Great for business and leasure travellers. Fantastic pool. Excellent restaurants."
27,1709,"Jul 8 2007 	Just what a business traveller needs in India....	We stayed a week in New Delhi, several days in Imperial and several in Sheraton. Sheraton is very efficient, staff really tries to do their best in terms of service quality.The rooms are spacious and bathrooms are quite stylish! Good testers, including an indian brand of nature cosmetics, which we liked a lot.Restaurant serves wonderful food, bith local and international cuisine (although pasta bolognese was as far from real one as india is from italy). We were quite cautious with food at first, but had no problems at all (unlike in Imperial)...The lounge and bar area is great, with live singer every day, huge windows overlooking a garden, decent choice of cocktails and human prices.The most surprising thing was an email from the hotel after I returned to Zurich, saying that I had left a body lotion in the room and they were willing to ship it to me...How sweet! Even given the fact that I would more than certainly have to pay for shipping - it was still nice of them to get back to me."
28,1709,"Mar 29 2007 	Great Experience	I'm not a fan of paying very high sums of money for business stays in India but when I stayed for 1 night at the Welcom Hotel - the experience, product and service was so good that I could not help but rate it to my international hotel stays. From the fully loaded rooms to the A+ food in the coffee shop, the gym, the executive lounge with the fresh orange juice - all of it was a great experience. I paid USD 300 per night which to me is unaffordable but at USD 150 I will come back again and again."
29,1709,"Jan 19 2007 	Great service average rooms mediocre food	As its name suggests you are made to feel welcome from the minute you enter and pass by two tall Turban clad men who salute you. The entire lobby floor is impressive - ideal for large families or groups who like to laze about the lounge and for kids who love toilets that have tv screens in them.The rooms, however lack the added luxury touch other 5 star properties in Delhi have. We sampled the food in the 24 hours buffet restaurant and in the pan asian restaurant and found both to have excellent service but mediocre food."
30,1709,"Dec 23 2006 	Great option if you get a good rate and have transport arrangements	It's been quiet a while since i stayed here, and back then I had got a great package deal at this hotel. Room was luxourious, nice, spacious, marble bathroom and all. Overall our stay here was enjoyable.Only downpoint is that its far far away from the main part of city and most tourist spots and in Delhi if you dont have your own transportation, you will find it almost impossible to find a local taxis and autorickshaws, and if you do find one, be absolutetly sure that they will RIP YOU OFF.Despite the poor location, if you are getting a good rate here, and have your own tranport, do not hesitate o stay here coz it is a fine fine hotel."
31,1709,"Aug 5 2006	Pretty good	I was satisfied with my 1-week stay. My room was decent size, bed was comfortable. Only 4 hangers in the closet, that was not good for a 5 day stay obviously. Internet access was convenient. the hotel isn't really in any interesting area, but is convenient by car.The breakfast buffet was decent. I'd stay there again, I think it was good for the price...but there are a few more luxurious places in Delhi for a little more money, and it's probably well worth it to splurge on one of those."

2,1710,Aug 26 2009 	Looks are good but be cautious	The hotel's interiors are good but the food and the bed were not at all good. The hotel does not have Room Service. A big Upsetter. Another thing is that it is located in a quite remote area.
3,1710,"Jun 4 2009 	Low budget business class hotel - heart of delhi	Hi,Stayed in this hotel a couple of times. Pretty neat hotel &amp; in a good price. Around 5 K's, it is value for money. The facilities are good &amp; the connectivity from the hotel to any part of Delhi is simple. The location is quite near to India Gate.The breakfast offered is good &amp; I have seen quite a few Americans &amp; European's staying in this hotel on their business trips. Defenitely Value for money."
4,1710,"May 28 2009 	Very nice place but overpriced and with an attitude.	I have stayed here once sometime ago. The place is beautifully constructed and the rooms are quite stylish. The menu is too westernized and choices are limited. The food is okay, not great. The staff has a bit of an attitude and looks down upon Indian travelers as the place is quite popular with western tourists."
5,1710,"Apr 15 2009 	Bleak Hotel in Upscale Neighboorhoor	Hotel looks great from the outside. Don't let that fool you. It attempts to be a boutique hotel, but it just missed the mark completely.Lovely, quiet, and safe neighboorhood about 4km from Connaught Place.Deluxe rooms are tiny, full of mosquitoes. Bathrooms are sleak, but not very clean. The service generally friendly but not extremely helpful.Hotel has WiFi, but it was SLOW and could only purchase access one hour at a time.Breakfast and restaurant were lackluster. I am pretty sure it was hotel food that was the cause of my food poisoning. (&quot;Delhi Belly.&quot;)I was shocked to learn how much my firm paid for this travel. (We used travel agent in India to make our India reservations, and I am sure was getting some sort of kickback). Deals in the areas at 4- and 5-star hotels (the Oberoi. LeMeridian, Shangri La) seemed to be much better, yet we were stuck here because our reservation was prepaid.Stay away."

7,1710,"Jan 3 2009 	Decent Accomodations for the Price - but with some problems.	Delhi is an extremely expensive city for accomodations and overall we were satisfied with Shervani. That said, it comes with issues. The Positives: It's in a decent location not far from Old Delhi and the popular tourist sites. The rooms are a good size and the staff was friendly.The Negatives: ROOMS: DO NOT get a room facing the front of the hotel. Demand one at the back. There are a pack of neighborhood dogs that howl ALL NIGHT LONG. I'm not a light sleeper but was kept awake the majority of two nights due to the insanely loud barking. I realize this isn't the hotels fault - but get a room toward the back. Also, I had to have the staff change the sheets to our bed as the &quot;clean&quot; linens had blood stains. I've traveled enough to be used to stained sheets - however blood stains I couldn't deal with. To the staffs credit they changed the sheets right away and replaced them with clean white ones. -- Also, after getting a room toward the back of the hotel (by night 3 I couldn't take the barking anymore) our new room was very large but the bathroom had no hot water. RESTAURANT: The restaurant is &quot;okay&quot;. Breakfast is eggs and cereal, however our first night there we ate dinner at the restaurant and bugs from the ceiling lights above kept falling into our food.... Despite the negatives, I still think this is a decent option in Delhi. The city is so expensive and Shervani provided a safe, clean (with the exception of our first set of sheets) room. If you are simply looking for an affordable place to sleep at night this is a fine option."
8,1710,Jan 12 2008 	Good Location and great rooms	This hotel has a wonderful quite location near the Delhi zoo. Modern and sleek the staff seem a bit aloof and distant but were very helpful. Maybe a bit overprized but a very good option in a city that can be a bit overbearing at times. Walk to the nearby SUNDAR NAGAR market grounds for brilliant food and antiques!
9,1710,"Nov 17 2007 	A dissapointment	We were disappointed with this hotel. It gives the impression of trying to be ultra modern but ends up being rather unwelcoming. We could not face a meal in the very bright ,cold feeling restaurant with tables packed closely together, even though we only saw a couple of people eating there. The buffet at breakfast was very limited and the worst we had during our stay in India.The rooms were of a good size but, as a previous reviewer pointed out, the TV has only Indian channels. The bathroom tried to be really modern but the area around the bath was cracked and chipped and the sensor operated light and fan that came on even when we were not in the bathroom was very annoying.It was one of those infuriating hotels where you have to slam the doors hard to shut them and so if you want a lie in or a snooze before an early morning flight, as we did, forget it!There was a mini bar but it was empty and the only way to get a beer was to call room service.It is true that it is in a quiet location but it is some way from the centre and impossible to walk anywhere for a meal or shopping. There is no bar and no public lounge area, so it is just your bedroom to relax in."
10,1710,"Nov 16 2007 	Not worth the money.....	Well, being first time in India, didn't know what to expect and was surprised for USD180, the hotel is doesn't live up to expectations but then again hotels in India are expensive in big cities!!!Arrived very late in New Delhi as in most international flights to New Delhi and by the time I reached the hotel which was in a secluded residential area, was shocked that the hotel is nothing but something like a terrace house that was &quot;reconstructed&quot; into a hotel. The exterior of the hotel looks good but the restaurant was pathetic when I arrived late for a dinner, the so called buffet dinner is pathetic with 5 dishes at its most and breakfast was equally bad. Nothing fanciful and nothing to really comment about. I would rather eat toast for every day during my 3 nights stay there. Coming back to the rooms, they are clean which I think is the best this hotel can offer and the choice of channels was limited to Indian channels compared to what was promised on their TV programme list. When I asked the reception about it, they say that you have to re-tune on your own which was a big disappointment. Service was so so with staff saying they do not have adaptor for my laptop which is important as I was on business trip.Close proximity to the exhibition center is probably why this hotel is expensive. Not much to offer within the vicinity and you do not really want to step out once you are in your comfy room.Given a choice, would not want to stay in this hotel again but given the expensive rate for hotels in New Delhi, it would be tough to find similar clean hotels at this rate I guess"
11,1710,Apr 22 2007	Really quiet and clean hotel with powerful showers!	Our stay at Shervani was great- the room was spacious and clean with a very powerful shower! The hotel is located in a very quiet and safe area and the hotel staff is generally very friendly and helpful. Great value for money.
12,1710,"Mar 20 2007 	Great until checkout	A friend booked our stay at Hotel Shervani in New Dehli. I was most concerned about cleanliness of the hotels. Since we were only staying in New Delhi for one night, we did not want to pay an exorbitant amount to stay in a luxury hotel. Pros: A pleasant surprise. The rooms and bathroom were very clean. The food was delicious (but we were hungry) and the front desk was very courteous and helpful (arranging taxis and such).Con 1: We were so pleased with our stay until check-out time. When we reviewed our bill, there were 2 outside phone calls that were made on our bill. The only interaction that we had with phones was receiving calls from another room in the same hotel at night. The record on the bill showed that a call to Calcutta and a call to Delhi had been made during the afternoon (we were not even in the hotel at that time...we were in Agra at the Taj Mahal!). We asked the front desk about it and at first, they acted as if they did not believe us because the calls were recorded. After a period of attestation, the front desk said that they would ask their supervisor and would refund us if they saw that we were telling the truth. We were not concerned about the money (it probably amounted to less than $2), but rather honesty. Our assumption is that whoever went in our rooms to clean it, made the calls. Fortunately, nothing was taken.Con 2: Most of the drivers did not really know where the hotel was located (I think it's fairly new). It's located around the corner of the main row of hotels.Overall, were it not for that one incident at the end, the stay would have been perfect and I could say that I'd stay there again. It's a really good deal for the cleanliness and amenities. However, it's a shame that this one incident could really break the trust or honesty of the service.I give it &quot;excellent&quot; for the accomodation, but &quot;poor&quot; because of our checkout experience. I hope that others did not experience this incident...such a shame."
1,1714,Loved the pool side	We really loved the hospitality and it was the great experience staying at Taj!
2,1714,beyond business	Stay was comfortable Staff was curteous attentive professionalism all around
3,1714,"Quiet and very comfortable	11th floor room with city view was very quiet. 7 by 8 meter room with green carpet, slightly stiff pillows. 42&quot; flat-screen TV, DVD player available. Amenities included fax/phone, mini-fridge, white marble desk, amoir, fresh fruit, safe, white marble bath (with shower ), built-in AC electrical adaptors, personal wake-up calls. Great service."
4,1714,"Nov 21 2009 	The Best in New Delhi	This is a fabulous hotel especially if you stay at the club level with butler service. While pricey, everything is exactly the way it should be. Rooms are clean, service fantastic, food is wonderful. After all the noise and crowded streets of Delhi, it is so nice to be able to return to this oasis. The gardens are fantastic at night - just a great place to relax. The Taj does it right."
5,1714,"Nov 18 2009 	Excellent hotel excellent service - great place to stay in Delhi	We stayed here for two nights right at the start of our holiday. I wanted to stay somewhere nice coming off the back of a Business Class flight.The Taj Mahal in Delhi didn't disappoint. We were met at the airport by a hotel car - we had a transfer as part of the Club Room - and whisked to the hotel. Upon arrival we were given cold towels to freshen up and checked in with a freshly squeezed juice.The Club room also gave us access to the Club lounge where for an hour or so every evening you had free drinks and nibbles. Staff there were very friendly and went out of their way to help you...and give you a good drink!We were then shown to our room, nice and spacious with a view of the pool. Bathroom was decent and came with Molton Brown toiletries.We spent a little time down at the pool which is nice and big - 30 metres plus - with plenty of chairs and recliners to sit on.One evening we dined in Varg, the on site Indian restaurant. While expensive for India it was excellent value for the UK and was absolutely delicious. The food itself was tasty, modern and well presented. The mushroom starter my girlfriend had was especially good, as was my lamb main that came in an earthen pot.Breakfast both mornings was simply amazing. A huge selection of fruits, cereals, breads &amp; pastries, Indian and Western hot buffet and a omlette / pancake / waffle bar. The masala omlette was the best I had of several in India!One evening we dined out in Old Delhi - an utterly mad and hectic place - at Karim's. It was full of locals, dirt cheap, and the food was awesome! Especially the freshly cooked naan breads. It might not be for everyone - it is a little hectic as I said - but for me it was an insight into the real Delhi.I'd highly recommend this hotel if staying in Delhi, it is a good base to go exploring from and is a real haven to come back to after the huslte and bustle of Delhi."
6,1714,"Nov 18 2009	loved this hotel	taj mahal situated in prime location in city provides easy accessibility to airport.taj mahal hotel treated us as family friends rather than guests.the service was great and the staff was very friendly and cheerful.staying here is like experiencing royal treatment .the food was awesome.u can take the benefit of the following amenties - massage centre,internet access,fitness centre,bar,gym.... &amp; many more.u can easily access most popular attractions &amp; sights as located nearby"
7,1714,"Nov 17 2009 	Impeccable yet friendly service	We arrived before our room was ready, so were given another room in which to rest. A white-gloved gentleman brought us tea and fresh fruit. The room service was elegant and prompt. The concierge ever helpful. As our time was limited, they arranged a car and driver for half a day with a couple hours notice. The bellman helped me repack some last minute purchases. All in all, this is a very elegant yet warm hotel. Worth every penny."
8,1714,"Nov 16 2009 	Great Place for Celebration	We arranged our office Party in hotel Taj, New delhi. We enjoyed very much. Such a good hotel. we were feeling great at that moment. Some per sonal thing began from that place. I found my new love there...."
9,1714,Nov 15 2009 	Awesome expreience with Taj	We celebrated our wedding there and it was a awesome expreience with TAJ and we also spent our 1 st night at taj it was seriously a quality time spent at taj which i cant forget in my life...thanks to taj for making my day a memorable day of my life.
10,1714,"Nov 14 2009 	Fantastic hotel	This was a fantastic hotel which oozed decadence. We had stayed in Taj hotels elsewhere in India and had similar experiences but this one topped the lot.The resturants were varied and wonderful.My young children were well looked after and catered for. You were greated with freshly squeezed juice in your room, as you arrived. Belgian chocolates and other luxuries."
11,1714,"Nov 12 2009 	Ignore the exterior - this is a fine hotel	We arrived at 4am after a 13 hour drive due to a cancelled flight. We were quickly &amp; efficiently checked in by extremely well trained &amp; friendly staff. The room was lovely &amp; luxurious. Included breakfast was excellent. The swimming pool was large enough for sensible use &amp; the hotel had every amenity one might expect from a genuine 5 star hotel. The bar was expensive but very good. The only Indian restaurant in the hotel served pretentious nouvelle cuisine type food which was amusing, if expensive."
12,1714,"Nov 1 2009 	Amazing experience	My wife and I stayed in Taj Mahal Hotel on the 27th and 28th Nov. We reached the airport around 4 AM in the morning. The airport pickup car was already there and our ride to the hotel was smooth. Immediately upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted by a receptionist outside. Our luggage was taken by the bell boys for security screening and we were told they will be brought straight to our room. Sunita showed us to our room. The in  room check in was one of the smoothest check in I have ever had. The room was nice with very comfortable bed and a brilliant city view- overlooking the India Gate. The flat screen 42 inch TV kept us entertained whenever we needed it. As part of the Taj club lounge access we were treated to complimentary tea/coffee, soft drinks all day. At certain times of the day they had free sandwiches and savories etc and in the evenings a selection of cocktails (all complimentary). Just remember that Taj Club lounge is on the 8th floor. This was something that wasnt told to us during check in. So if your room includes taj club lounge make sure you ask about it during check in. The hotels lobby was very impressive with very nice dcor. The swimming pool is huge and is attended at all times by cleaning staff. The hotel staffs are very friendly. From the security guards to the managers people showed genuine interest in us. Breakfast was very good as well and included a wide variety of choices from Indian to continental and fruits and yogurt.Overall I must say that you get your moneys worth when staying in the Taj Mahal Hotel. Only negative thing that I can point out is that they charge you for using the Wi-Fi, which I believe should be free for guests staying at the hotel. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone who loves luxury but is not afraid to spend a little extra to get it. A definitely 5 ***** experience.PS : Thanks to all the staff for introducing India to my wife."
13,1714,"Oct 28 2009 	So good.....	We had 3 nights at the Taj as our starting point in India.It was great. The room was lovely (club level) and very clean. The room was serviced twice a day and fresh fruit and nibbles were always replenished.The staff were friendly and helpful. The pool was so refreshing after long days sightseeing! The concierge organised a driver each day to take us sightseeing. This was very inexpensive, and such a great way to get around (about $30AUD for 4 hours).Fantastic!"
14,1714,"Oct 8 2009 	Another great Taj property	I stayed here a few days while sight-seeing in Delhi. As I've come to expect from the Taj chain, this hotel was great. The rooms were large and comfortable; mine included a nice view of the capital. The bed was soft. The bathroom was large, with a separate tub and walk-in shower. There are a couple of fantastic restaurants inside the hotel, including a Chinese placer and a sushi place. The service was impeccable, with people available to help me with all of my needs. Best of all, there is a huge, deep pool in the back of the hotel. It was perfect for swimming and lounging..."
15,1714,"Oct 7 2009 	Great Charm	A great hotel with its very good services, and delighted interiors of the room as well as outdoor. Very nice food and its varities are so good. No hotel is as like TAJ. BUt it is costly."
16,1714,"Sep 24 2009 	Quiet comfort and outstanding service.	I stayed in this hotel several times for varying numbers of nights, using it as a base for short trips from Delhi. The service was friendly without being over familiar - there was a feel of a 'family' hotel. In spite of the size and busy-ness of the hotel, staff quickly learnt my name and routinely addressed me by name from the doormen up. Similarly, staff in the various restaurants and cafes quickly learnt my likes and dislikes.My room was comfortable, always spotless and the views over New Delhi are fantastic. The calm, friendly but always professional atmosphere provided a welcome escape from the pressures of Delhi in monsoon season. The main India restaurant, Varq, is worth a visit in its own right. A 'fine dining' restaurant, presenting traditional Indian food with a modern twist, staff are happy to advise on which selections will work well together and will discuss which dishes are hot, mild etc frankly and honestly. Potentially stressful situations were quickly resolved: laptop failing to interface with wifi - a technician came to my room to sort ot the problem within minutes, car booking overlooked (I had alot of cars, I'm not surprised that one slipped through the net), no problem, cars are available 24 hours a day, I still arrived at the airport in plenty of time for my flight with the minimum of fuss. As the person who is usually dealing with someone else's crisis, it was genuinely refreshing to stay here.I'm trying to work out how soon I can get back..."
17,1714,"Sep 24 2009 	One of the best hotels I have stayed in	This was one of the best hotels that we have ever stayed in. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel welcome and important, even though we were not staying in an expensive suite. We were given a great room with a pool view, which I would recommend requesting. The room was a good size and came with a small couch and coffee table for relaxing. The bathroom was very large, with both a stand-up shower cubicle and a separate bath with shower. There were plenty of towels and great toiletries.The bed was comfortable and there was a great selection of English-language channels on the television, as well as a DVD player and complimentary DVD rental service.We used the pool on both of the days we were staying there, and received complimentary chilled mineral water while we were sunbathing. It was also possible to order drinks as there was a waiter service, and we were also given complimentary fruit kebabs.One of the best things about this hotel is the bars and restaurants. On our first night we went first of all to Ricks bar, where we had martinis. The staff were most helpful and booked a table in the Chinese restaurant for us, and also gave us complimentary cocktails to try! The food in House of Ming is the best Chinese food we have ever tastedit was simply incredible, and there we ordered food and were also given some complimentary dishes to try which were beautiful.On our final evening we ordered room service, which did not disappoint. My husband ordered a curry and it was lovely and came with complimentary poppadoms, and then when we had finished they returned with complimentary Indian desserts.We really enjoyed Delhi, but would return just to stay in this hotel again!"
18,1714,"Sep 20 2009 	My first choice when in New Delhi	Definitely my first choice when in New Delhi, a bit pricey, perfect service, comfortable clean rooms, very good varity of food for breakfast, spacious gym, affordable internet access, and good location. Beware of the touts with the 3-wheelers outside of the hotel who always (!) will tell you that Khan market is closed, on the other hand even though I never took their service I have a lot of fun with them."
19,1714,"Sep 11 2009	Great service. Very professional and accommodating. Refreshing for an Indian hotel.	Very flexible management. We had 9 in our group. We called Friday at 3pm looking for a place to stay that night. During this season they had a discount on the rooms. Warning: Luxury tax in India dictates that the tax be applied to published room rate, not the rate you actually pay. Anyway, the manager gave our whole group a very late check out the following day so we could all have fresh showers before being on a plane for 16 hours.Room service was good. Great selection and variety of food available. Decent prices considering a 5-star hotel. Didn't particularly like my meal. But plenty of food. Dining in the restaurants was very good. Food quality was good. Again, prices what you would expect for a 5-star hotel.Rooms were well equipped. Bathrooms were very nice. Beds super comfortable. Not Indian style mattresses. We ordered a short tour of Delhi. The car was excellent and the driver was professional. The tour operator was good and I'd use him again. Another misunderstanding in the car charge. I had to pay an extra 500 Rs for going over the mileage limit - even though that was never explained to me and the tour was only 3 hours instead of 4."
20,1714,Aug 5 2009 	have money in the pocket	it was an average experience...but have traffic in the locality ...
21,1714,"Jul 29 2009	5 Star Service	Location:Taj Mahal Hotel is situated at one of the best localities in New Delhi. It is very close to the Diplomatic centre of Delhi. Khan Market is the best Place to shop Near by. Also there are 3 to 4, five star hotels giving you a plenty of options to dine and wine. Close to the city center conought place. Location: 5 starHotel:Hotel is supposed to be one of the best, it has 4-5 Restaurants, you have a real multi cuisine option. Varq, (The Restaurant) the specialty of Chef Hemant Oberoi is a signature restaurant here. Also the hotel has everything that a 5 star hotel should have gym, pool, Jiva Spa.....so on. The lobby is simply amazing. The hotel has its own armada of luxury cars. The infrastrucutre of this hotel though a little old is upto the mark. You would not need to go our anywhere to find anything, you'll get everything at the hotel. Room:The standard room that i stayed in is actually pretty descent and spacious. 350 sqft to be precise. The rooms are subtle and elegant with a lot of functionality. You can even custom design you bed with the choice of Cushions, linens etc provided by the hotel. The bath is fairly OK. All standard rooms are equipped with fax machines, a great utility for a business traveler. All in all great satisfying experience.Service:This is what i would like to talk about, they make you feel as a Head of the state, Check in procedure is really fast, in fact you are first taken directly to your room and then all the other procedures are completed. Excellent staff, really helpful and smiling makes you feel warm and comfortable. In room dining is a treat, they set your table in an utmost delightful manner. There was a small problem i faced during my stay was when the evening turn down service was not done. On complaining the same was done in minutes, the hotel even took the pains in finding out why such an error had happened 5 days later the front office manager called me at my residence apologizing for the same and promising of it not happening again. This shows the sheer dedication and commitment of the staff members. Excellent business services are available at the hotel. The concierge too is efficient and quick. All in all I would give the hotel a big ***** for excellent service quality. This is truly the Best Taj property. Taj lives upto its reputation, TAJ MAHAL is a truly luxurious experience."
22,1714,Jul 20 2009 	Service par excellence	I travel to Delhi for business quite often. The place where I always stay is Taj Mahal Delhi. The rooms are beautiful &amp; luxurious. Why i feel this hotel is great because of the service level. The guy near the lift remembers you name &amp; floor. Greets you every time with a big smile. Their bar is really good. The club floor is really exciting. The only drawback of this hotel is the food. The swimming pool area is really nice &amp; peaceful.
23,1714,Jul 16 2009 	goes to prove that shangrila delhi is the only safe bet in delhi	it started with the lights in teh room not working...but thats ok as that can happen and they reacted quickly to move me out in 5 minutes....the fun began when i ordered the dinner and they sent warm white wine...yups.... and they could not udnerstand what i was complaining about... after which they figured and sent me the wrong wine although to be fair it was chilled now !!!the less said about the FARCE of security checks the better but all said since it is a Taj property i will try them one more time as maybe it was just me..... though this goes to show again that the shangrila is the only safe bet in terms of consistent service
24,1714,"Jul 14 2009 	Utterly Amazing. Beats any other 5 Star htoel ive stayed in	My goodness, Firstly I regret having only discovered the joys of TripAdvisor recently.So I felt compelled to write a rather tardy review of my stay at the Taj Mann Singh in March 2008.My goodness, nothing short of an absolute pleasure. I dont think that it would be an over assertion to say that my experience epitomized what staying in a hotel should be about.Staff were so polite, friendly, attentive, nothing was too much for them.The hotel was superb the pool, the rooms, the grounds.Mmmm PS those who like Paneer, try it at their in house restaurant! HEAVEN!Sublime.Cant wait until March next year. Taj Mann Singh here I come!!!"
25,1714,"Jul 13 2009 	Fantastic hotel - service rooms and facilities excellent	I stayed here on business in July and was thoroughly impressed.Rooms, service, restaurants , gym and bar are all world class.Though the price is high, if you can find a good deal or are lucky enough to be able to stay here anyway, I would recommend that you give it a go.I am a frequent visitor to Delhi and having stayed at many 5* hotels across the city I beleive this one must be one of best at the moment."
26,1714,"Jun 22 2009 	Oh my god why arent there hotels like this in Australia?	my company put me up at the Taj at delhi. Boy did that open my eyes about the supposed 5 stars in australia.what a hotel, amazing, ever smiling staff, awesome rooms, views. posh lobby, amazing food and you can choose from 3 restaurants and a bar and that too in the same hotel. comp upgrades, comp bottle of wine, free hotel limowill def return, but only when i could afford something like the TAJ"
27,1714,Jun 11 2009 	The best	It was a wonderful experience to stay at TAJ Delhi. It feels like heaven...
28,1714,Jun 9 2009 	nice relaxing holz	the food was nice and the rooms were spacious i wld recomend the hotel
29,1714,"Jun 9 2009 	one of New Delhi's largest conference venues	LocationNestled in six acres of lush greens in the exclusive Diplomatic Enclave of the city, Taj Palace Hotel is the only one in the top-of-the-line category near Gurgaon and is a mere 10 minutes drive from the airport.RestaurantFrom casual, all-day eateries to formal, fine dining, guests can look forward to a wide selection of delectable dishes and refreshing drinks at the onsite restaurant."
30,1714,"Jun 6 2009 	palacial property	As always the Taj had stood up to my expectations in this palacial property in New delhi. It is quite centrally located in the national capital. The hotel is busy 24 hrs check ins and check outs happen all day long ,just sit around in the lobby lounge and you can kill your time well, if you dont have any other work. Its got a nice bar also."
31,1714,"Jun 3 2009 	Beautiful	I stayed at Taj Mahal Hotel only for 2D/1N but like other Taj properties, this one was simply luxurious. Hospitality was awesome, food - just what you can expect from Delhi. View was a bit on the disappointing side - I'd a pool side view. Room was luxurious with a huge bathtub and all the accessories one can expect from a five star. Rates are a bit on high side, but Taj properties give you more than value for money. The hotel is well located with close proximity to key business hubs and is recommended for both business and leisure purposes."
32,1714,"Jun 3 2009 	Fine Food and Comfortable Rooms	The best part of the hotel is the wide food selection - one of the best joints to eat in the City. Great Chinese, Japanese and Indian selection. Rooms are basic but very cosy. The pool is set around a garden. Service is the best in its class"
33,1714,"Jun 2 2009 	worth the price	I used to dine frequently in the coffee shop of the taj and in other restaurants, that's when I cared to join their loyalty program and decided to book a room to stay for one one night and forget all tension and true to its reputation it did not let me down.had a wonderful time and Ricks the bar is amazing place to just chill and have a few drinks with your mates"
34,1714,Jun 2 2009	Very good	An absolute must stay in delhi.Everything is exceptionally brilliant here. Has the wasabi and other renowned restaurants.rooms are lovely and client service is very good
35,1714,"May 31 2009 	Outdated overpriced and tasteless	The hotel is practically located, close to Conaught Circle, but with no facilities in the direct vicinity.My room was upgraded to a mini-suite, which meant a series of small connected rooms on the inside of the hotel, with most windows looking to the hallway (not directly outside).Apart from 2 flatscreen tv's, which some will see as a luxury, the rooms were a bit outdated with the most uncomfortable chairs one can find.The gym had 2 modern treadmills and 2 cross trainers, but had no staff present, maybe because the smell was so bad that I left after 10 minutes. The bar was empty and looked like one of those places where 6 staff come to you to help you, after which no one will remember to bring your order (you must have experienced this before).Finally, the breakfast area resembled more a youth hostel with (again) these flatscreens with the morning news in hindi. Not great if you want a quit breakfast.Overall, on all points, the hotel scored very poorly, despite price of over INR 9000 per night."
36,1714,May 29 2009 	Great hotel to stay.. good service. value for money!!	I had visited Delhi long time back and stay at Taj hotel. my experience with the hotel was very good.Complete value for money.
37,1714,"May 27 2009	Experience like a King	Hi my name is sandeep and m frm delhi i hav lived in delhi for since i born i hav good experience of many hotels but the taj was very special for me i hav purchase a mobile with a coupen for prize 3 night and 4 days for living in &quot;Taj Mahal Hotel&quot;. In my whole life i hav never seen hotel like this the place, gardning ,areas an lots more things i lived &quot;Taj Mahal Hotel&quot; for 3 night an 4 days with my whole family an my house was locked in those days the staff was very nice with smart dressup with smile. Those days i hav knowledge about how it made its beauty an also the food was exellent an very delicious. The staff of taj treat us like a king.  Overall the &quot;Taj Mahal Hotel&quot; exiperience was realy very nice and i suggest to all people that pls when u came in delhi u must saw the &quot;Taj Mahal Hotel&quot;. Thank You"
38,1714,"May 25 2009 	Grossly overpriced - but Taj service	I found the Taj to be excellent in service, but the hotel is just grossly over priced. The food is great, and the pub at Ricks is excellent for us middle aged people. At half the price, I would recommend it strongly. Hopefully the commonwealth game will introduce new supply of hotel rooms and reduce the rents at this hotel too."
39,1714,May 18 2009 	Memoriable Taj	A Memoriable Experience. The Rooms are very clean. Stayed in one of the Club Rooms. The Service is remarkable and the Taj is really a Memoriable Experience.
40,1714,"May 16 2009 	Really ROYAL	It is a herritage building and simultaneous proximity to the cultural legacy and epicentre of ruling political power centre makes it so very unique. Everytime while driving down the road, where thousand boots rock to offer presidential salute on Republic Day, to TAJ had made me feel something royal and proud. Pardon my childish excitement but TAJ mansingh is different from TAJ Aguada, Goa or the GATEWAY series that TAJ group has been offering for middle class family like us.The natural greenery overlooking the swimming pool and lawn is soothing at its first glance. Still parrots and pigeon wake you up from the comfort of designer bed. The silence all around allows you to catch up with yourself.There may be different types of room, but mine with our corporate discount was clearly the best value for money so far I have witnessed.The room naturally is excellent in its decor and ambiance. The buffet breakfast is interesting and really healthy - I can say that it is too pampering. The cheese array is surely requiring a closer look.The dinner is MING is what I indulged and trust me it is true ethnic chinese. Any more word is superflous - you need to try it out."
41,1714,May 12 2009 	Perfect Business Hotel	This hotel is centrally located with every facility which may be required when you are on a business trip. The service and hospitality of Taj Group is beyond comparison.
42,1714,"May 11 2009 	Great Hotel!	From the view of a 13 year old.We used the Taj Mahal New Delhi as a base in our travels. We stayed here 4 times for just a night at a time. It was a good place to chill with a nice deep pool. The rooms were okay, they had TVs and fairly priced broadband internet. The breakfast buffet was awesome! The service was great and all the people were very friendly.Jet Privelage Number = [--]"
43,1714,May 10 2009 	Great business hotel	Taj has been an old favorite of mine although the rooms are getting a little dated compared to the Oberoi and other new properties. The hotel has very good F&amp;B outlets including the new Wasabi.
44,1714,"May 10 2009 	Very Royale Treatment	Superbly located in the HEART of Delhi, every aspect of the Taj Mahal Delhi was a treat to the senses.Got here in the night and honestly did not have too much time to look around and enjoy the hotel. But from the bell boy's smile right up to the hostess' introduction to the various features my room provided ---- it was all quite royale!Breakfast was a buffet in the restaurant and was quite a lavish spread.... I feasted that morning on Masala Dosas (In Delhi??? Strane Right! But I chose to go for it and didnt come disappointed)The room i think was a little smaller than many of the other hotels i havse stayed in but I must also admit that I was not on the top-dollar paying list......."
45,1714,"May 7 2009 	Royale Palace	The Taj Mahal Hotel is an epitome of luxury. The place is so very beautiful, so much to see with every inch of this luxury hotel. The fountains, the paintings, the art, the brands at the designer retail outlets. The rooms are very well appointed the staff and service is excellent the food and dining experience had been like no other. Wow I gotta get there again!!! I was touched when one of the staff realised that I had not been able to have breakfast and packed some fruits etc for my trip!!! Now that is what I call service and seeing to the needs of your customer.I also remember that I was offered DVDs to watch in my room that were complimentary and added to the breathtaking experience!!!"
46,1714,"May 4 2009 	Great Service	Great hotel. classic one. I find the rooms aren't original,and quite costly, but service, amenities, grounds, location, are all excellent. So you pay a lot, and you might find better value for money elsewhere, but it is a safe place, and anytime if i have to stay in delhi in hotel, my choice is this one, a class hotel"
47,1714,Apr 29 2009 	service extraa ordinaire	from the moment u enter the taj mahal hotel til the time u leave u dont have to lift a finger as they do evrything for u ..if they cud chew ur food n give it to u they wud..so if u the kind who likes hotel staff falling all over u then this is the place to be..the new japanese restaurant wasabi is fantastic...worth a visit..

49,1714,Apr 27 2009	pleasing place	a comforting stay. good food and service. very strught line and fine furnishings all over the hotel.
50,1714,"Apr 27 2009 	The Club Rooms are Superb	I stayed at the Taj Mahal last year when visiting Delhi for a conference. They had a good rate going for the club room so I opted to stay there instead of a regular room. The difference is huge! The club rooms are newly renovated and have a much better design aesthetic than the regular rooms. The furniture and furnishings are chic and modern, and the glass walled bathroom has motorized shutters for privacy if sharing the room. Small touches like Molton Brown toiletries also make the stay a pleasure.All round service is good as always, and restaurants are of the highest quality. It is worth paying a little more to stay here than any other 5 star hotel..."
51,1714,"Apr 26 2009 	Decent Taj experience	This is a mini version of the Bombay Taj but it's difficult to pull it off...seems a little bit dated to me...rooms are not as nice although Taj service is just as strong as it is everywhere else...whereas the Mumbai Taj Mahal has no competitors, this has plenty in Delhi, and The Imperial is a cut above undoubtedly"
52,1714,"Apr 25 2009 	The best hotel I've EVER stayed in	AMAZING! So so beautiful, the staff are outstanding, the food is the best in India, the rooms are just beautiful, the pool and spa are lovely - staff again are so hepful........it is expensive but well worth every penny.....we stayed a tthe Taj in Mubai and it wasnt hapf as good as this one. I have stayed at many hotels around the globe but this is certainly the best yet......cant wait to go back!"
53,1714,Apr 23 2009 	Best luxurious hotel.	It's the best decorated and luxory hotel with Taj hospitality.
54,1714,"Apr 22 2009 	World class hotel	We spent 4 nights (in total) at this hotel. The first 3 nights were prior to our Golden Triangle trip and the last was after the tour had finished. Without a shadow of a doubt that this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in.The security was tight but friendly and very reassuring - always with a smile. Also included in secuirty was a very large monkey, on a lead, with his handler. He was used to chase the smaller monkeys off the hotel grounds - which was amusing to watch.We had a Club room and the service was fantastic. The bulters were very attentive, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I commented on some snacks we had and a large tub was delivered to our room free of charge. You also get a complimentary transfer from the airport, which was seamless and hassle free - espically on your arrival into Dehli airport. A complimentary bottle of wine and snacks were also provided.The Varq restaurant was out of this world, with Indian cuisine at its finest. Breakfast was fantastice - recomend the Dosa Masala very tasty.The pool area was clean with no shortage of beds. The attendants here coming round with water, cold towels etc on a regular basis. What we like was that they were not afraid to challenge anyone who wore any inappropriate swimwear. There was a young guy who went into the pool in his cut off's and he was promptly told these were not swimming shorts - all with the contiuned politeness shown through out our stay.On our return for our last night, we were remembered - even by the guy who called the lift. for us who welcomed us back. The whole experience from start to finish was perfect and I would have no problems recommending this hotel to anyone. If we ever have the good fortune to visit Delhi again, this will be our definate choice of hotel."
55,1714,Apr 21 2009 	Outstanding property	Excellent service and great property. Very business friendly
56,1714,"Apr 20 2009 	Professional and Friendly	I've stayed at Taj Mansingh several times, while traveling on business. Like most Taj business hotels, it has great service, excellent rooms, and is overall very professional and great for business travel."
57,1714,Apr 20 2009 	Arbitration Mayfield	The experience was awesome. Truly world class hotel with excellent business facilities.
58,1714,"Apr 18 2009 	BEST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN	I got the room booked through the AMEX Platinum Travel Service. I landed in Delhi late in the night and took a taxi to the hotel. Security was tight in the entrance area and all my baggage was scanned. Check in was very smooth and friendly ,and I was upgraded to a club room. I was extremely tired, having flown nonstop from Newark. I was offered a tea as a welcome drink ,which I gladly accepted. A few minutes later a gentleman appeared with a huge tray of goodies ,including tea, hot milk,hot water,cookies and cake. I was a bit surprised and overwhelmed. The room was extremely clean and tastefully decorated. Bathroom was very nice,too. I had a shower and fell asleep. A continental breakfast was included in the AMEX plan, but I found that I had access to the full breakfast buffet which included both Indian and Western spreads of the highest quality. I stayed in the hotel for 12 days and I was very impressed withe overall quality of service. The rooms were turned over twice a day and all used tea/coffee stuff was promptly cleaned and replaced. I also had a complimentary lunch with the customer service manager at the famous House of Ming restaurant. In general, the attention given to me was sometimes overwhelming,but I never felt ignored. The only quibble I have was that the internet facility in the business centre was quite expensive, at INR 500/hr. It was particularly galling because it was hard to get internet access in the local markets without a local ID. At about USD 260/day I felt the hotel was extremely good value for money,even after considering the fact that it was an off-season rate."
59,1714,"Apr 18 2009 	Fabulous Luxury Hotel in the heart of City	Taj Mahal Hotel at Mansingh Road is very close to Connaught Place, heart of Delhi city. Its a 5 star property with excellent rooms, amentities, gym, pool, spa and restaurants.I have stayed here on couple of occasions and everytime checked out with a Wow. On both the occasions, I was upgraded from a normal room to Club room, which comprises of 40&quot; LCD, personal DVD player a Bose home theatre and internet server.Its a decent hotel for business travellers, however tourists may find the cost prohibtive, my advise is to check out any ongoing offers on their website before deciding to book."
60,1714,Apr 17 2009 	excellant conviniant location	hotel is very beautiful and closely and easily accessable to all attractions and buisness places in heart of delhi
61,1714,"Apr 13 2009 	Forget what it looks like this place has THE BEST service!	Stayed here for 2 nights and then for our return overnight stay switched to the Imperial (a mistake). When we arrived I was very disappointed as the exterior of the hotel is being renovated and then when we went to our room I was even more disappointed - gloomy, tiny bathroom with no separate shower. It took me a few hours (during which I changed my next stay to the Imperial) to get over these cosmetics. What I can say is that having spent almost a week in India staying at this hotel, The Imperial and the Amarvilas Oberoi in Agra, that the service in this hotel was streets ahead of anywhere else and on EVERY level. The spa is fabulous - the treatments some of the best I have had anywhere in the world. A 1.5hr Abayanga massage was actually just over 2 hours by the time the &quot;extras&quot; like the steam baths, the exfoliation etc were factored in - normally these things mean the actual massage is only 1hr. A quick 30 min foot massage also had an added free neck and shoulder massage because the therapist saw me strain because my neck was stiff....end result a 50min treatment. The room was always kept perfect, every amenity used was refilled (very unusual these days) and the moulton brown toiletries lovely. The indian restaurant Varq was by far the best quality food we had anywhere....and the cocktails were amazing. Service was fantastic from the security guy who called the lift and remembered your name and floor to the guys in the coffee shop who merrily chatted with us about our day and made the best cappucinos (with little jokes on them). Appearances really can be deceving, what makes a great hotel is the details and the service and this hotel really does have that."
62,1714,"Apr 13 2009 	Charming and elegant hotel for business or pleasure	This is a very nice property with great location, excellent restaurants, nice grounds and very helpful staff. Beautiful pool, a few blocks from Khan Market (try Aniohi and Fabindia for clothing and gifts) and near most things. Safe neighborhood for jogging and excellent security. Taj Club Level is very elegant with great service and nice club area. The Chinese restaurant was particulalry good."
63,1714,"Mar 8 2009 	service in every detail	We have never seem service with such an eye for detail. It's an excellent hotel, the rooms are good and spacious and well equiped. The restaurants and the bars offer a wide joice with quick service. The pool and the garden are excellent and well kept. The surity is good. All the staff take personal service and attention for the guests to the higest level. You couldn't feel more welcome and appreciated, from the moment you come in till you leave the door after check out. An oasis in hectic Delhi. We will surely return."
64,1714,"Feb 18 2009 	Impeccable Service - Safe 	I have been to Delhi about 10 times over the past 3 years and always try to stay at the Taj. I wrote another review after an earlier stay, but think I should write another one now to let folks know all the safety precautions the hotel has put in place since the tragic incidents in Mumbai. All cars and stopped/searched before they even enter the hotel drive-around. Then all packages.suitcases etc are put through a metal detector, then you (person) walk through a metal detector... These are the same precautions that were put in place in NYC after 9/11 (I was working in NY at the time). Sadly, I heard that a number of tour groups had cancelled their trips to Delhi. I think it's important to tell folks all the precautions that hotels like the Taj have in place now.On top of the safe/secure feeling - I feel &quot;at home&quot; in the Taj. Many of the staff members remember my name. The service is impeccable! The food is impeccable! If you stay, do try the Sunday Brunch - amazing selection!!!!!!!!!"
65,1714,"Feb 7 2009 	Great housekeeping service	After a highly embarassing mix-up at check-in, I was downgraded from a Taj Club to a Deluxe room. Not a great experience which the Resident Manager was fortunately swift to discuss in detail the next morning.What really made this stay a comfortable one was the phantastic services provided by housekeeping. The attendant must have seen that I am using Molton Brown ammenities. Swiftly the next day, I had all hotel ammenities changed to Molton Brown (which is typically only provided in the Taj Club rooms. Wonderful, personalised service. Obviously some thinking going on!The room itself was nicely presented, good size with a sofa to relax. I did not use the internet service but the working desk was certainly of a good size with appropriate lighting.I like a good sized bathroom with a separate shower so the bathroom was not quite to my liking having to stand in the bathtub for my shower.It looks like the breakfast buffet has somewhat improved since my last stay. Service was Taj-like very very friendly.I had one interesting experience when I went to read my newspaper at the poolside. The attendant insisted that I sign a liability waiver form ... guess this is the direction that India is moving to! Hazardous activity reading the paper close to the pool, I guess."
66,1714,"Feb 2 2009 	Wonderful Customer Service	This hotel has all the comforts you would expect from a 5-star, but the incredible customer service and care we received made this one of the best places I have ever stayed! We were made to feel so special, almost as though we were staying in a family home, rather than a hotel.Thank you so much Taresh, Lakshay, Albert and Bharat for taking such good care of us and making us feel so at home."
67,1714,Jan 29 2009 	Excellent service!	Lovely hotel with very attentive staff. The service is excellent. The rooms are nice and comfortable but there is nothing special /different about them. The spa needs to be upgraded but again the staff there are very helpful. Varq restaurant is incredible and should not be missed. I was supposed to return to the hotel at the end of my trip but I decided to try The Imperial Hotel instead. It had nicer rooms but the sevice was nowhere near as good.
68,1714,"Jan 26 2009 	Good if you have deep pockets	This place has exceptionally good service! They know you by name, no matter where you are in the hotel. Your room is kept absolutely spotless and its a real haven from the noise/pollution unique to New Delhi.However it is very expensive, and they charge you for everything! The wine list prices were out of control, as were the restaurant prices within the complex.I didn't love my stay there - its ok, but I did feel ripped off a bit regardless of the great service."
69,1714,"Jan 17 2009 	Best Service in the World	Best Service in the WorldHaving had the good fortune of staying at many of the truly great hotels in the world, the service we received at the Taj Mahal in Delhi was certainly as good, if not better than anything we experienced elsewhwere.It starts when you arrive at the front door where there must be about 20 people for security, helping with your luggage (they take it from you, put it through a detecter and the next thing you know its in your room. If you booked the Taj Club with airport pickup (highly recommended especially if this is your first visit to Delhi) as soon as you exit the car you are met and escorted to your room for a quick and seamless check-in.Just entering the lobby you notice the large number of people who greet you and once there a day, they address you by name. Now here is something else that impresses methere is always a duty manager watching over everything. In fact just before coming to Delhi we stayed at the Trump International in Chicago where anyone in management was hidden from sight.Now for a few examples of their superlative service. On a previous trip to India, a merchant in Jaipur cheated us. For a year, we tried to resolve the problem with Amex but to no avail. Amex explained that they only serve as a mediator between the customer and the merchant and because the merchant refused, we were out of luck. We explained this to the concierge and they made it their business to help get our money back. First, they made repeated calls to the merchant who became so frustrated they refused to talk to the concierge. The Taj had me contact the hotel whose guide took us to the storethe Aman-i-khas and they too began to call. When the merchant still did not acquiesce, I was told to write a strong letter to the Taj chain, the Oberoi chain and the Jaipur tourist office explaining that unless we receive our money back, the hotels etc. will blacklist the merchant. That did it and we got our money back.Another example: we were leaving the hotel and returning a few days later and wanted to leave a suitcase and a paper bag which held 2 dolls. Storing the suitcase was no problem. To solve the bag issue, they left it with reception and when we returned, it was promptly delivered to our roomthey dont know how to say no.This to me is the clincher. On our last day (we stayed for a total of 6 nights on 4 occasions) I celebrated my birthday. We got up and ordered coffee. A few minutes later the coffee arrived and a procession of others carrying a bouquet of flowers, a beautiful extravagant birthday cake and a bottle of French champagne (we enjoyed both at dinner that night.) Just about everyone at the hotel knew it was my birthday and I couldnt walk in the lobby, visit the club or even talk on the phone without being wished a happy birthdayI am not exaggerating.In conclusion I cant imagine better servicelast year we stayed at the Imperial and the Shangri-la and there really is no comparison. Its my pleasure to heartily recommend thr Taj Mahal in Delhi"
70,1714,"Dec 25 2008 	Great service great experience	Five nights in December 2008. Security was tight following the incidents in Mumbai, but the staff did everything possible to make it a pleasant experience. Perhaps too much - do they really need to have someone press elevator buttons for you? Very generous on late check-out, good laundry service, helpful front desk staff. Rooms are very nice but I agree with previous posters - could use some renovation, particularly the bathroom. Breakfast was positively the BEST hotel breakfast I've ever had - spectacular options every day. Rick's Bar in the lobby is really nice, as is spa."
71,1714,"Dec 22 2008 	Excellent!	The Taj was to be our first hotel on our two week tour of Rajastan and it certainly lived up to expectations.We were collected from the airport by the friendliest driver ever, given fresh cold towels and two ice cold bottles of water...the service didnt drop throughout our stay.Great pool, great restaurants, great staff, room and bathroom a bit on the small size for the money.Go for the club floor if you can, excellent club lounge with complementary drinks and canapes each evening. Club lounge manager was excellent!All in all a perfect start to our Indian adventure..."
72,1714,"Dec 14 2008 	Loved the stay	We had an event in the Taj Mahal hotel this April. stayed over the hotel for 2 nights. it was an amazing experience. after the long day in the event, the hotel rooms was a delight. the food at the restaurant was a real treat. we have never experienced such incredible service before. It was so lovely that it was difficult for us to leave the place.Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in for business specially when my boss is extremely fussy! i think if he as a person found it so convenient it should be for mmost of the places. besides the banquent hall where the event was held is a great place"
73,1714,"Dec 14 2008 	loved the suite	i was at the taj, new delhi on 31st of may 2008 with my girlfriend .....it was like an escape from all or family and friends for a couple of days.I was just amazed to see the suite, we booked a persident suite and the ambience of the place was amazing, i just loved the beds and the interiors......the place was so romantic.me and my girlfriend had great time in there."
74,1714,"Dec 12 2008 	Truly exceptional service	I have stayed at Taj Mahal New Delhi for two separate nights during a business trip. What sets the hotel apart is how the staff takes care of the guests: everyone, from bellboys and security guards to spa and check-in personnel, is always happy to help and satisfy any wish. I am an experienced traveler, but was pleasantly surprised with the sincerity of the staff`s attitude. Having said that, I have to say that generally I find the amount of attention a guest receives at Taj is excessive  I would probably prefer less attention to my persona.Hotel`s facilities are appropriate for a 5 star deluxe hotel but not exceptional. Lobby is gracefully decorated in Mughal style (with marble fountains, water basins, carpets, etc), check-in takes place at the table, rather than at the counter, i.e. one can seat during the procedure. Unusually, check-in is finished in the room, which I found convenient, because one can then immediately ask any questions about the room, etc. Overall, check-in staff is courteous and efficient.During my first stay I was placed into an ordinary king room. It was spacious and clean, most of the equipment was slightly dated, but immaculately kept. On the second stay, I have received an upgrade to the Taj Club (pleasant surprise) level and that room`s fitting were more modern (LCD TV, etc), with the dcor even more opulent. Both rooms were quiet and had a view  very positive impression overall.Guests staying at Taj Club rooms have access to a lounge on the 8th floor. The lounge is very elegant, with cosy sofas in the corners. Courteous and attentive personnel serves wines (of quite good for India) and snacks in the evening.Breakfast did not live up to my expectations  I certainly expected more from a deluxe 5-star hotel. The only highlights were made-to-order omelets and warm buffet with vegetable and meat or chicken dishes that changed every day. Otherwise nothing to write home about, but still perfectly acceptable (for my European taste).Hotel has a good gym with two cross-trainers (from LifeFitness), five or six tread-mills (LifeFitness and Technogym) and quite a few weight machines (mostly Technogym). I have used the gym extensively and found it perfectly adequate and not crowded at all.Other facilities (which I did not use) include spa and outdoor swimming pool and several restaurants (including an Indian one).Hotel location is good (close to India gate), but I found this to be of little benefit since in India one has to take taxi all the time anyway.Overall, Taj Mahal is an excellent hotel for a business traveler or a well-off tourist and I found its price-quality relation is much better than that of, e.g., Hyatt Regency (at which I also stayed during the same trip). While the rates were similar (both at about EUR 370), Taj Mahal is infinitely more exclusive and superior in almost every aspect. Would definitely stay again, but only if someone else foots the bill."
75,1714,"Nov 11 2008 	exceptional service but building needs some updating	We're on a whirlwhind 3 week business trip that will take us to India, Seoul and Japan and thankfully the company has put us in some wonderful properties. I am a hotel snob and when I travel for pleasure I do tons of research on properties, activities, the facilities and restaurants, and this was no different. I did my homework on this place. The things I look for most are the rooms, the gym and the food. Unfortunately, we were only here for a night and left early the next morning to go to the real Taj Mahal. Here are my impressions. The hotel is beautiful, one of the best chains there are. I guess it would be like a Ritz Carlton, but the Indian version. We checked in, and were whisked to our room to complete the process, coffee, juice and tea were delivered along with some cookies, chocolates and cakes. It was a nice welcome. Here is a detail point that bears mentioning, it will help to give you a glimpse into the hotel as a whole. The entire presentation was delivered on a large silver tray, and the coffee pot was under a white linen tea cozy as was the milk for the coffee, which was steamed, and had its own separate tea cozy. That right there spoke volumes to me. They thought that far. the room was nice, it was on the top floor and was a good size, with all the stuff it felt a bit cramped; desk, loveseat, coffee table, armoire, chest for luggage and 2 double beds. We called down for a wake up call, and were asked if we would like coffee brought up at that time, or when a more suitable time would be. We skipped it since we were heading for the gym anyways. Again,another nice touch. The gym is great. The equipment is brand new, there are tv's in the treadmills and other cardio equipment, which is cool, as well as a whole host of machines and free weights. I work out every day back home and this was a good hotel gym. There is also Morimoto restaurant and a place called Varq, which serves modern Indian cuisine, which I would have liked to try.Ok, so here is the thing about this place, its a great 4/5 star hotel, but the building is old. It needs to be modernized. It shouldn't prevent you from staying here, but they are undergoing a complete remodel apparently, and I think when that is complete, it will be spectacular. email me if you'd like more info"
76,1714,"Nov 4 2008 	Fabulous hotel with unmatched staff	I am generally not one for high end hotels. They tend to leave me feeling nickel and dimed (why is it in US only high end hotels charge you to get online, to park, to have breakfast?) and when on vacation I feel like my money could be better spent on experiences and dinning. The Taj Mahal in Delhi is the exception. My wife and I have stayed their twice, and I look forward to doing so again. Its not just the hotel is nice  and it is. It has a great restaurant, a nice oasis of a pool, even a good gift shop. What really sets these guys apart is the staff. Its not just that they are well trained. They have a politeness and an interest in your stay that cant be trained  its genuine. I always feel like they view themselves not as employees, but as ambassadors for their city and country  they genuinely want to be sure you are enjoying your visit. Not cheap for sure, but if you can afford it, its money well spent."
77,1714,"Sep 14 2008 	Very nice hotel	Staying for business was nice :- good breakfast and a lot of restaurant in the hotel- friendly personnel- nice and big roomDuring my stay, one of my shirt was dammaged accidentely by the laundry service, and I get a full reimbursement by the hotel on my credit card.One negative point is that the wirless connection did'nt work properly with my laptop. The personnel give me an extra WiFI card, but it was still not OK. This was annoying for me because I needed to check my business mail and it was impossible. So, please be aware!"
78,1714,"Aug 14 2008 	great service	I stayed here for a week and found it really excellent. The &quot;luxury room&quot; was comfortable, everything worked and was in good shape. Parts of the hotel do perhaps look a bit dated, in the sense of not being very fashionable but NOT in the sense of being worn out in any way. In any case the room itself didn't feel outmoded. I tried room service several times which was excellent - really top notch. Breakfast was pretty good but dinner in the Machan restaurant was the only real let-down in my stay - muzak way too loud and pretty awful, and the food very uninspired. There are other restaurants in the hotel which look really interesting but I didn't get to try them - a new Japanese place, a brand new &quot;gourmet Indian&quot;, and a Chinese restaurant which has apparently been one of the best in town for years.The best thing about this hotel is the excellent service. You really get the sense that they want everything to be perfect for you. If you ask for something it gets done promptly. The only slight drawback is that some members of staff push a little too hard to please you and it can get annoying.The hotel gym is fairly large and well equipped. Pool also nice.The lobby of this hotel and function rooms always seem to be buzzing as it is a favourite for local events (very classy ones) and for celebrity and political VIPs. All in all, a very good place and if you can get a good deal on a room, I'd go for it."
79,1714,"Jun 10 2008 	The Best in Delhi	I can't find a better hotel than the Taj in Lutyen's Delhi. Superb location, most efficient service with a broad smile, top class eateries (newly opened Japanese restaurant must be the best in the country), well appointed rooms with spectacular views and to top them all the best club lounge in town with most efficient staff always at your service. I stayed at Taj club floor where you have 24 hours butler service. I found all the butlers to be very alert and super efficient in every way. Three cheers to the Taj, Delhi!"
80,1714,"May 1 2008 	A super efficient hotel	We stayed twice in this hotel on our arrival and departure from India, total 3 nights.It is in a high class and quiter residential area of the new city and excellently placed for easy travel to all the main sites.What impressed us was the really welcoming and efficient staff where good service is the standard.The rooms were excellently appointed and comfortable with great views over the city.The restaurants were very efficient and the cioffee shop lounge one of the best.We could not fault it and recommend it when passing through this city."
81,1714,"Apr 14 2008	Great hotel unparalleled service	I'm writing this out from my club room at the Taj -- my first stay here. The club rooms are very comfortable, although I wish the bathrooms were bigger. But the public spaces are quite tasteful and Old World (it's a 30-year-old hotel after all), with a very grand dame air as befitting one of the top 2 hotels in Delhi for VIPs. No complaints so far, and even the spa, which is the oldest of all the Taj hotels in the Delhi, is still well-maintained and well-appointed. However, what we have enjoyed so far -- so much so that we have booked our stay here on our way out of India and canceled a previous booking at another hotel -- is the unparalleled service. Everyone is friendly, professional, helpful and great to talk to -- and many remember your name or details about you. It's like a home away from home, which can be quite important to a visitor in a very foreign place like Delhi. I cannot think of any staff member I was not impressed with. This alone made our stay very memorable. And not at any time were we made to feel that anyone expected a tip from us in return!"
82,1714,"Apr 7 2008 	Good business hotel but that's about it	My wife and I stayed here while in New Delhi in Jan 2007. We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival, as per my AMEX. The suite was large no doubt, but the decor was stuck in the 1980s. The bathroom shower had the glass half door which i hate - water splashes everywhere. However all Taj properties use Molton Brown toiletries, which are very nice.The Taj Mansingh (which the locals call this hotel) is well known for it's Ayurvedic massages. If you are into that, you will love the dual syncronized massage.The business center is good and fully staffed at all times. Also they have tea and snacks for suite guests.Rick's Bar is actually one of the hot spots in New Delhi - serving good cocktails and cuban cigars.This hotel is geared toward businessmen. If you are in town for business, this is a good option."
83,1714,Mar 31 2008	Exceptional service	We stayed at the hotel for one night before joining a tour and the service was faultless. We booked online in advance and were contacted before we arrived to find out if we had any special requests. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the restaurant and bar were excellent. The bar is quite loud but a lot of fun! We were so impressed we booked back in for 2 nights after our tour and again the level of service lived up to our first stay. The pool is also wonderful and much nicer than the oberoi or the imperial. We ate at both these hotels as well but the service did not compare to the Taj. All I can say is that you will not be disappointed.
84,1714,"Mar 30 2008 	Great Hotel - clubs rooms	We really enjoyed our 2 stays at the hotel. Pickup at the airport went well each time. It does pay to call them first to double-check though.Our first room was a small club room and not really big enough for 2 weary travellers with lots of luggage. We did appreciate the personalised check-in (with cold drinks) which is held in the room and the way we were whisked there.The club lounge made up for the small room. We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast and nibbles with first-rate service. There is also a PC with internet access in a seperate small private office.On our second stay the room was much larger and comfortable - still a club room so I'm not sure why.Staff at the hotel were excellant and soon sorted out any little quibbles.We had 2 great meals in the ground floor restaurant and one out by the pool. Price-wise the restaurant meals were very reasonable and good quality.The pool menu is over-priced though we really enjoyed the birds swooping down to try and steal a snack.Another very nice feature of the hotel is the spa. It's free for hotel guests and has very good staff, steam room and all the usual things. Can't recommend it more highly.In all, I'm really glad we chose this hotel. Stayed in lots of 5* through-out the world and this was up with some of our more extravagent ones."
85,1714,"Feb 29 2008 	A Really GREAT Hotel	We stayed at the Taj Mahal Hotel twice on our recent 3 week trip to India. The first time in a Club room, and the second in a basic room.From our friendly airport greeting (WARNING: Indira Ghandi Airport is undergoing major renovations making it even more confusing and disorganized than ever. An absolute zoo!) and throughout our stays we were treated as though we were the only guests that mattered at the hotel. Pool side rooms have grat views of the garden and pool, with ornate parliament buildings in the distance.Without exception the staff was attentive, the service flawless. Even the elevator guard addressed us by name from the first and remembered us on our return. The butler service on the Club floor was impeccable, and the Club rooms come with a separate lounge and dining area with full waiter service for evening cocktails and a memorable breakfast. In my many years of various Club floors nothing has even been close to the Taj Mahal Hotel.Our return stay in a basic room (they are slightly smaller, but just as well furnished) was no less perfect. During our first stay they had noted our preferences and made sure that the room was set up to our liking prior to our arrival.Other reviewers have complained about the price. Hotel rates in Delhi are extremely high and the Taj is very good value when compared to the competition. A little homework on their website should reveal some good special rates (the special rate for our Club room was $475 plus tax at the height of the season, and included early check-in, airport transfers, a bottle of imported wine, flowers, fruit bowl, bottled water, chocolates and that attentive butler).There really was not a single thing that we felt could have been improved... and we're not that easy to please!"
86,1714,Feb 24 2008 	Most Amazing Art	Wonderful hotel. amazing ambience and authentic artwork in lobby. Wonderful city which changed my life. Everyone must visit India if they get the chance to.
87,1714,"Feb 18 2008 	Great hotel!!	We stayed a couple of days in this wonderful structure in New Delhi. The hotel is in a beautiful area in the south of the city, it is member of The Leading Hotels of the World (5 stars). Of course rooms are at top level, with some interesting ideas, typical of luxury hotels (every morning a basket of most important newspaper are in front of your rooms, with also the first two pages of internet most important newspaper of your home country), there is a large swimming pool and there are some restaurants inside. Rooms are very confortable, as well bathrooms. Breakfast is above average with international and indian food. Price of course are very high... The only thing we did not appreciate very much is that the area (the embassy area) is a sort of &quot;closed&quot; area for indian people, so you will be in a sort of &quot;gold prison&quot;, that means that if you choose this structure to be in a typical indian atmosphere, maybe it is not a good choice. In a snapshot: expensive but really beautiful."
88,1714,"Dec 26 2007	Not so bad definitely not great.	Service is good as most of the luxury properties in India. But there's no charm in this hotel. This is a business hotel for PC users. If you are a Mac user like me, you'd prefer the Imperial Hotel. (if you know what I mean...)Avoid this hotel for a while. There's a construction for a Japanese restaurant in the hotel and you smell the toxic fume at the lobby. (whatever that toxic fume was I do not know but it gave me a bad headache. Besides, Sushi in India sounds like a very bad idea to me.)"
89,1714,"Nov 1 2007	Nice hotel great service	Nice hotel and would stay here again. Great service. It is not an outsandingly beautiful hotel, reception and lobby quite average for a 4-star and perhaps a bit disappointing for a 5-star and rooms bog standard but all in all we had a good stay. Good for business trip and I was taken very good care of.I have eaten in one of the restaurants (Indian) twice and on both occassions became sick. This may be a co-incidence but have avoided ever since."
90,1714,"Oct 23 2007 	Wow! Superb!	We stayed here for two days to visit Delhi. We came back from Jaipur where we attended a wedding and before returning to Europe from Delhi we visited Delhi. We had a very good rate, but it was kind of tricky. Officially the room was 200 euro a person, but it turned out to be 40 euro because it was booked by a travel agent. At least that's what I understood from the information given. Maybe it was 200/room (3 people) - vs 40 euro per person (?).Anyway the hotel is like a paridise in the middle of Delhi, probably like all of the top hotels in Delhi/India are. The rooms was great, very modern, well kept, clean, ... The lobby looked like a palace, especially at night when the lit a lot of candles near a small pool.The breakfast and meals were also superb. We didn't like India that much, but we were glad we could eat some normal food over here. The hotel is in New Delhi, so if you want to go to the old part, it takes some time. But hey, with a taxi it's quite easy and not expensive at all. The only bad thing is that taxi drivers will take you to some tourist shops in stead of driving you directly to the place were you want to stay.I would certainly recommend this hotel if you can get about the same rate as us."
91,1714,"Oct 2 2007	A Delhi Delight	We stayed four nights on a Saga tour. We could not fault the hotel in any way - service impeccable, rooms very comfortable, food: the best buffet breakfast ever, lunch and dinner well up to standard with no 'Delhi Belly', grounds, pool and location excellent. Our abiding memories will be of the wonderfully friendly and helpful staff plus having Shilpa Shetty at the next table at lunch!"
92,1714,"Sep 5 2007 	Lovely Taj	We chose the hotel for its great location and name. The hotel provided an excellent value for our money. It is a bit older property with outstanding service. Throughout our stay we felt extremely well taken care of. Magnificent pool and ambience. Very nice spa and gym. Quality of food is not that great but the overall service, staff and a laid back vacation sort of environment made it one of our best stays in Delhi."
93,1714,"Jul 20 2007 	Beware of ""Special Offers""!	I had originally booked the less expensive Taj Ambassador for a one night stay in New Delhi between transport connections. On checking in, they happily informed me that we'd been upgraded to a room in the nearby Taj Mahal at absolutely no extra cost. The first hotel was charging 130 USD per night and the Taj Mahal's rack rate is 290 USD per night, so I was pleased to accept. The room was clean, well-laid out and amply provided with the usual hotel bits and pieces. However, on check out early the next morning on the way to the airport, they tried to stick me with a huge tax bill based on the Taj Mahal's rack rate. Their excuse was that this was a &quot;special Delhi charge&quot;. I refused to pay and, fortunately, had the website printout of my original booking. Eventually, all charges were suddenly waived with no explanation offered as to exactly what was going on. I didn't eat in the hotel as it is extortionately expensive for what's on offer but there are lots of great dining options nearby - try Khan Market. The best thing was the view from our 4th floor room - right over the gardens of Delhi to Vijay Chowk and the Presidential Palace. However, not sure if that in itself would be worth forking out over 300 USD. Overall, I was very disappointed with the Taj Group during my stay in India."
94,1714,"Jun 24 2007 	5 star world in nasty New Delhi	Arriving in smelly New Delhi International Airport after mid-night and in June in 38 C of heat is no joke - however, the management and staff of the Taj Mahal know exactly how to make your stay completely comfortable. Ordering a pick up from the hotel is the only way to navigate from the Airport to the hotel in comfort. Arriving you are met by a saree clad dedicated member of front desk who takes you to your room and for check-in. The hotel is really well air-conditioned and I assume the unusual sweet smell throughout the hotel is due to insect repellent - in all my stays in Taj hotels I have yet to see a mosquitoe or any other type of insect.Rooms are excellent with 7 feet wide beds, TV, work desk, sofa and wifi access (for an extra fee). The foyer and other common areas of the hotel are expansive, clean and comfortable where relaxation or small business meetings can take place. The breakfast is excellent and the fare wide ranging - and for dinner/lunch there is 24 hour dining and also a range of other restaurants to choose from.Service from staff was excellent throughout. For me there is no other place to stay in New Delhi."
95,1714,"Jun 12 2007 	Good Hotel Good Service	Taj Mahal was the first stay for DOHA 2006 Tourch Relay team. It was a good hotel to start the mission with. Rooms were clean, tidy and stylish, pool was OK. however some major paint has to be done to the hotel building. other than that.. its a the stay to be if you want to go Delhi for good price."
96,1714,"May 1 2007 	Hotel ok food toxic	I am a veteran world traveller from New York City with five decades under my belt and a long background in South Asia. I stayed at New Delhi's Taj Mahal Hotel in mid-March 07.It is a well-run hotel with excellent service. But its small, drab, tired rooms, worthy of a 1960's generic Hilton, are certainly not worth the extraordinary rates charged.I was seriously poisone by the food at their lobby restaurant on 14 March with two types of parasites that required three courses of powerful antibiotics and anti-parisitic drugs. Indian friends also told me the Delhi Taj is notorious for food poisoning. It is shocking a hotel chain of this standing and cost would serve contaminated food. Obviously, my last stay at any of the Taj Hotels."
97,1714,"Apr 30 2007 	One of the Best in New Delhi	There's no such thing these days as a reasonably priced first-class hotel in New Delhi. If you budget allows, however, the Taj Mansingh, as it's known to locals, is one of the better choices. The location is great and the staff attentive. While not up to the level of service as the Oberoi properties the Taj runs a close number two in New Delhi among the big Indian chains The Club level rooms only appear to be slightly larger than the regular rooms so not sure if they are worth the extra expense. The hotel has a superior spa (one of the top three in the city in my opinion). The one area in need of improvement is the quality of the food. Machan, especially, can be hit and miss although it is packed at many hours due to lack of alternatives in the hotel or immediate area for upscale variety. Rick's is a very popular bar, especially on weekends. For a more sedate and friendly alternative try the lobby tea lounge. You can get drinks there, as well, and staff is more attentive."
98,1714,"Jan 28 2007 	Excellent arrival after trans-Atlantic flight	Perfect service upon arrival being met at the airport, greeted repeatedly at the entrance and taken directly to our room without the hassle of a front desk check-in. The Indian restaurant was wonderful, the breakfast buffet sumptuous, the over-all service exceptional. ( One small exception was when we checked out prior to departure and the switchboard informed our friends that we were gone while we sat in our room waiting for them.) Having read previously about the taxes, I had no room to argue, and was prepared for this extra amount on the bill. I had not, however, confirmed the rate for picking us up at the airport ($65). Thanks to tripadvisor comments we selected this hotel and could not have been more pleased. Our friends used the beauty shop and the work-out room, also. Would recommend this hotel highly."
99,1714,"Jan 6 2007 	Excellent Service. Watch out for excess taxes.	We recently spent 4 nights in a Taj Club room. The room was nice (if nothing out of the ordinary), and we couldn't have asked for better service.We arrived on New Year's Eve ready for an exciting evening at the hotel's outstanding Indian restaurant. However, I fell sick and ended up stuck in the room. The in-room dining manager went out of his way to provide my partner with an outstanding dinner that he personally served in the room. It was an extremely nice touch and cheered us both up on what could have been a very disappointing evening.The butler service in the Taj Club lounge was excellent, and the food was very good in all the restaurants.My only complaint was with the way the taxes were levied. Instead of charging 12.5% tax on the rate we were paying (which was $370 per night booked throught Five Star Alliance -- about $100 per night less that Leading Hotels had offered), the hotel charged tax on the rack rate (about $550 per night) and also charged a small tax (about $2.50 per day) on breakfast, which was included in the room rate. That added up to about $150 more in tax that I had anticipated paying.I complained vigorously to the duty manager the evening before check out. I insisted I had never seen such a practice anywhere else in the world and that I was not willing to pay the excess taxes. I had taken copies of my reservation confirmation, which showed that I would be paying 12.5% tax and made no mention of the tax being applied to the rack rate. By having the confirmation in my possession and insisting that I was not willing to pay excess tax, I eventually got the tax reduced to 12.5% on the $370 rate instead of the rack rate. They wouldn't give in on the breakfast tax, and I eventually gave up on that one. So, if you go prepared with your paperwork and remain steadfast in your refusal to pay the excess room tax, you can avoid it with a bit of a fight. It's just a shame the fight has to take place at all!But despite the tax issues, it was a fantastic place to stay and we really appreciated all of the help that the staff gave us! I would definitely go back."
100,1714,"Nov 27 2006 	Terrific property watch the luxury tax charge	This hotel, located away from central Delhi in the green, government area, but still allowing easy access to desirable sites, has a lot going for it: astounding lobby with period art rotundas, big city service, elegant rooms, pleasant views, responsive staff, but the one thing you have to watch is the luxury tax charge. We booked our $ 210/night through Travelocity, which confirmation advised of a 12.5% tax. Our closing bill, however, attempted to charge 12.5% on what we were advised was a rack rate of $ 500. This was the first we learned of this! Needless to say, we refused to pay the exorbitant amount and the manager relented. Be very clear when making reservations here. The club room dining salon, the Grille Room, is pricey but a delicious alternative to weeks of delicious Indian food. The concierge is knowledgeable, without playing the commission game, and the breakfast buffet is varied, delicious and in a very pleasant setting. We would stay here again in a snap. The Mercedes to the airport is a comfortable ride."
101,1714,"Oct 30 2006 	Best service I have ever experienced	I stayed for a week in October for business and my expectations were continually exceeded. Asia is known for good service but this hotel takes good service to a whole new level. I have stayed in the Peninsula Hong Kong, St Regis, Mandarin Oriental, Shangri La and others and the service levels at this hotel were even better. We have about 4 rooms as there was a few of us travelling together and we found ourselves sharing good service stories each day.This hotel was a little more expensive than others but well worth the extra $. You certainly feel like royalty there."
102,1714,"Oct 29 2006 	Watch out for brown water	My wife and I stayed in a Club Room at the Taj Mahal for 10 days in October. Like others who have commented on this hotel, we found the service and welcome to be impeccable. The Mercedes waiting for us at arrival was a treat. We have never experienced as enjoyable a check-in as we did here. The staff is attentive but unobtrusive. We tried all the restaurants and the quality is excellent at all of them. The breakfast buffet is very good indeed, although we have seen even more impressive buffets in Beijing hotels (such as China World). The waiter service at breakfast is somewhat inconsistent. The hotel could use some updating; the infrastructure is more than 20 years old, without any investment since then. The rooms are smallish for what we associate with executive-level service. We became ill for unrelated reasons, and the hotel secured a physician who promptly attended to our needs for an outrageously reasonable cost (the only bargain associated with the hotel!). What was really troubling was going for a shower, turning the water on, and watching the yellow-brown water pour out. Not a question of waiting for it to clear --- it just kept coming regardless of how long we let it run. For the premium price of a Taj hotel, this was unacceptable to us and enough to tell us we will not return, no matter how attentive the service. Hotels need to get the basics right - and rusty or dirty water is simply unacceptable. The plumber claimed the abnormally high water pressure forced the rust out of the old lead pipes. He never answered the question why the lead pipes were there in the first place. They are unacceptable by today's environmental and human health standards."
103,1714,"Sep 11 2006 	a sanctuary in the middle of delhi	The Taj Mahal was a sanctuary in the middle of Delhi. The rooms are very well equipped with pleasant views over greenery. The staff are first rate. The reception staff are incredibly welcoming. The buffet breakfast is the best we have ever had. The waiting staff were friendly and efficient without beig at all intrusive. They were particularly kind to our 12 year old son. There is no touting for tips. The pool is huge, deep and peaceful. Although aimed primarily at a business market, it was excellent for teenagers. Better than the Imperial."
104,1714,"Jul 30 2006	Cheated on Sales Tax	I had the same experience as the others. They overcharged on the sales tax, nearly $100. Makes me wonder if I was cheated on other parts of the bill too."
105,1714,"Jun 5 2006 	Really loved our stay here!	We stayed for seven nights, and I must say choosing a hotel in the first place was very very difficult. In the end we went solely on the opinions of Trip-Advisor members and what we were able to afford (the Australian dollar is only worth US$0.75). We found the very best rate possible off the Five Star Alliance site (thanks to another Trip Advsor member for that tip!) and booked a package that included a standard room (only differs from the deluxe room by not having a fax machine), round trip airport transfers and breckfast, for US$170 per night. Obviously for this rate we did not get a executive club room or use of the club facilities, but we did go up and visit a club room to see if we were missing out on anything.So firstly, we turned up at the airport at midnight, very very tired after a 15 hour journey, and there, bless his socks, was the Taj driver waiting for us with our name on a huge piece of cardboard. Agian, it wasn't a Merc as we went for a cheaper package, but the car was great and the driver very professional. Check-in was carried out in our room, not in the lobby, and took only a couple of minutes to complete. Overall, the room was spacious, the fixtures perhaps a little shabby and worn round the edges, but the bathroom was huge and done very nicely in a dark red/black marble, with a separate bath and shower and two fabulous shower heads. Apparently they gave us a corner or next to corner room (ie at the end of the corridor), and these have bigger bathrooms. The room facilities were very generous, with a mini room-service every evening, daily chocolates, about six complementary bottles of water every day (contrary to other member's comments about this hotel, you do NOT have to tip to get extra water - they just give it to you anyway) and four huge towels (rather than the standard three). The bed was reasonably comfortable (by Indian plank standards) and although we were on a smoking floor, there was not a hint of stale smoke in the room.The Club room that we checked out was exactly the same size, but with more modern decor and a newer touch - probably not worth the extra money, especially since our standard room bathroom was bigger (that was luck though).What really impressed us about this hotel was the absolutely excellent level of service provided by all the staff - friendly, helpful, attentive and very welcoming. The Concierge went out of his way to help us with a couple of really difficult busines requests (like sourcing three hundred bars of a special soap made in the south of India), and the elevator guy knew our floor number within a couple of days. Another excellent feature was the breckfast buffet - probably the best selection of food I've ever seen in a hotel. Overall, one of the best hotel stays I've ever had."
106,1714,"May 23 2006	Cheated with the sales tax	As a previous reviewer said - they charge the 12.5% tax on the shameless reception prices, not the actual one booked! I was extremely p---- at check-out so they decreased it a little bit but nevertheless that was way more than expected and had I not been under time pressure I would have stood my ground...I wrote a complaint to the manager later the same day (that was a month ago) but have not received an answer and I doubt I will. Does anyone have an idea how to require a refund - maybe writing to the Best Hotels of the World or the Indian tax authorities?Otherwise excellent service."
107,1714,"May 5 2006	Beware of tax charges by Taj Mahal Hotel	THE HOTEL HAS A TAX OF 12.5% PER NIGHT. HOWEVER, IN OUR EXPERIENCE, THEY CHARGED THE TAX ON TWICE THE AMOUNT OF THE ACTUAL BILL. THUS, WHILE OUR BILL WAS approximately US $600 AND THE TAX SHOULD BE $75 (12.5%X600=75), THE HOTEL CHARGED approximately $150 in tax. When we brought the overcharge to the attention of the hotel, they said they charged the 12.50% on the amount they feel the room is worth rather than the actual amount paid. That made us feel cheated."
108,1714,"Mar 23 2006 	The Taj is one of the best hotels ever	Imagine that you have arrived in Delhis chaotic airport late in the middle of the night after an exhausting 10+ hour flight (and that is the way most of us from the West arrive). You are hoping that the email you sent requesting to be met by a hotel car at the airport was read and understood.As you emerge from customs, there are literally hundreds of people waving signs with peoples names on them. Amidst the mob, a man dressed all in white carrying a large (possibly the largest) sign emerges from the crowd. It says Taj Mahal Hotel on it. And your name is written in bold letters right in the middle. Relief flows over you. He takes your bags and you walk a short distance to a late model white Mercedes. He whisks you to the hotel in 30 minutes or so.You are greeted on the steps of the hotel by an enormous bearded man dressed in traditional Indian gear and a petite young woman who knows your name and is ready to take you directly to your room. The two men opening the door and the elevator operator greet you by name. As you emerge from the elevator you see a man down the hall. He greets you by name. He is your butler and he is holding a tray. On it are two glasses of fruit juice (orange and pineapple) from which you may choose. Your butler shows you around your room, which is equipped with electronic controls for everything from lights to temperature to the curtains. Your room butler arranges with the technology butler for your Internet WiFi service to be turned on. They leave to allow you to get some sleep  if you can.Around the room are a complimentary bottle of wine and several different kinds of fresh fruit. There is a plate of dried dates and apricots. A luxuriously stocked mini-bar will fill any other unmet needs.The bath is granite and decorative tile with a separate shower stall with one of the best showerheads and best water pressure of any hotel I have stayed at. There is a bowl filled with rose petals and three vases of orchids around the room. The toiletries are Molton Brown and include everything you might need from a comb to a toothbrush.Complimentary shoe shines and clothes pressing are included in the rate, as is continental style breakfast and cocktails in the evening. This is the Club Level at the Taj Mahal Hotel. Yes, its expensive by Indian standards. But it costs about the same as a decent hotel room in New York City and its so, so much nicer.The bars and restaurants in the hotel are wonderful. The staff is uniformly helpful and their mission is to please.You cannot go wrong staying at the Taj Mahal Hotel."
109,1714,"Mar 2 2006	Treated like royalty at the Taj	From the moment we walked in, we felt like we were given special treatment at the Taj Mahal Hotel, New Delhi. The outer doors were opened by the traditional Raj-clad attendants, but the inner doors were opened by elegant and smiling ladies who learned our names after a day or two. The lobby is organized in a more personal manner than most such hotels, with tables with hospitality specialists rather than a large off-putting counter. Indeed, the lobby is elegant, yet cozy, with decorated inverted domes in the ceiling and Mogul style artifacts. Around the lobby area are set many tables for morning business conversations or afternoon tea. At one end is the bakery, with delicious espressos and teas as well as fabulous French pastries.We usually stay at the Imperial in Delhi, but it was booked so we decided to try the Taj. We were able to get a very good deal for a stay of five days through the Five Star Alliance website. It seems difficult to book the upper end hotels in Delhi for under $300 a night these days. The rooms were somewhat smaller than the Imperial, but very nicely appointed, with wood trim and granite in the bathrooms. Our bathroom had a nice tub and separate shower and was quite large. The rooms were also quite clean and the beds were delicious, with down comforters and cotton linens.For me, the highlight of our stay at the Taj was the breakfast buffet. The array was truly amazing - the best I have ever encountered anywhere. As vegetarians, we had quite a bit to choose from, including fruit, baked museli and yogurt cups, six varieties of bread for toast, vegetable tofu, croissants plus Indian specialties such as paranthas. We were pleased to be able to offer such an array when we invited friends to join us. The dining room was sunny and comfortable and the service excellent.Another highlight was the laundry service. Finished items were returned within 8 hours, protected in plastic, in starched linen baskets with a rose on top. The pressing service was also excellent.I communicated through email with the Taj several times before my trip and received a prompt response. Our needs, such as for non-smoking rooms, were well taken care of.The staff was quite courteous in all respects and solicitous of our needs. In one case, when we were to change into another room, they called and apprised us as to the updated situation to let us know that they were aware and working on it.I would not hesitate to recommend the Taj Mahal Hotel in New Delhi to other visitors. For us, it was a great place to overcome jet lag, to feel well taken care of so far from home, and to enjoy elegance and grace in the style of kings."
110,1714,Jan 18 2006	Good Place to Stay in Delhi	The hotel does not look great from outside. Just a concrete pile and even in need of a repair. But inside is better. Staff is friendly and efficient. The corridors were somewhat smelly (smell of damp?). We were with a group so there was a fixed meal and the meal standard was average. The breakfast buffet was good and generous. Rooms seem a bit outdated but comfortable enough with very wide range of amenities.
111,1714,Nov 14 2005	Best of the best	This place is lovely - the rooms have everything you could desire and are very nicely decorated and as clean as possible. The warm welcome from Staff adds a great touch and breakfast cooked to order was spot on. This place is faultless and having stayed there first time I wouldn't stay anywhere else when we are in Delhi again.
112,1714,"Oct 18 2005	Excellent hotel and staff !	My husband and I had just spent 10 days staying in a cottage, in a forest, in the mountains of north India where there was no running water or electricity. It was a 12 hour drive to Delhi so we were really looking forward to our 2 day stay at the Taj Mahal Hotel before flying home to London. We were not disappointed! It was fab! The room was lovely - with all the usual attention to detail - robes, slippers etc. Papers in the morning, plus a summary of UK news. We did intend to go out in the evenings and explore but the hotel was such a haven away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi that we went to Rick's bar for cocktails each evening and then ate in the hotel! The hotel staff were superb and we had a personal butler! We did book a standard room but from reading the other reviews on this site, I was led to believe only the club rooms came with this service (we were not upgraded to our knowledge so this is worth checking).On the final morning we sampled the buffet breakfast where there was a vast selection of food from all continents. We did not bother to pre-book a car to the airport (very expensive) instead, the doorman got us a cab (immediate) which is a fraction of the price (around 300-350 rupees).All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel."
113,1714,"Aug 18 2005	A business hotel... not worth the reviews... not special whatsoever!	For lack of other interesting places to stay in Delhi, we stayed at the Taj Mahal on the first night and the last night of our 10 day India trip in March. Our tour operator, Abercrombie &amp; Kent also raved about it. The result... a rather mild disappointment. There's no doubt this hotel is one of the best, is not the best, in Delhi. But it's a business hotel in a big city, just like in any other big cities. The entrance lobby is grand and majestic, however, the rooms are very small and blah. We also stayed in the club floor rooms, because the standard ones were sold out. The prices for these rooms were quite a bit, even by global standards. Complete rip off!! The room was tiny... no character... very boring &quot;Hilton, Sheraton&quot;-like standard hotel room. This was probably the biggest rip off in our entire India trip.The restaurant downstairs, which is supposed to be one of the best in town, was very... whatever. Restaurant service was very good, however, some of the front desk staff were very rude. One evening, we went to the newer, more modern hotel, the Park, for dinner. Granted, the Park can look like any other stylish boutique hotels you find a lot these days. We personally felt we would have been much happier at the Park rather than paying dumb price at the Taj Mahal. The restaurant was very good, too. (See our reviews for Amarvilas, Taj Mahal Delhi, Rambagh Palace, Lake Palace, Devi Garh...)"
114,1714,"May 6 2005	As it should be	An excellent hotel, possibly one of the best I have stayed in. Attention to detail was the key that made this place stand out above everyone else. Highly recommend getting a driver for the afternoon to show you around, don't be scared if he drops you off with a mate to go and explore Old Delhi on a rickshaw....an experience I can't recommend highly enough. The rooms were comfortable, the check-in process a dream, the attentive staff pitched at exactly the right level without being intrusive. The only negative comment I have to make is that for two hours driving around delhi the price was an excellent 800rps......to pick me up from the airport an extortionate 1,700 and it's only a 20 minute drive."
115,1714,"Oct 24 2004 	Pure luxury	On entering the reception to the Taj Mahal Hotel, you are confronted with spacious opulence. Marble, gleaming glass and brass, luxurious wall hangings - first impressions are excellent. The rooms are large, very comfortable and kept beautifully clean. Every night the beds are turned down and orchid heads are placed on the pillow. The restaurant is superb with a good choice of food - all excellently cooked and well served by courteous and helpful staff.My only complaint, was that on sitting around the large swimming pool, there was a distinct smell of drains and of course the noise of the traffic outside the hotel - but Indian traffic is prolific - so that was to be expected. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. Sheer luxury."
116,1714,Nov 2 2008 	Uneingeschrnkt empfehlenswert!
1,1715,Loved the service	I reached in the hotel and stayed there for 3 nights and stay was good and received best service.
2,1715,"Nov 18 2009 	Better than Expected	was the only avail 5 star hotel when i needed the room. was a bit skeptical having read online reviews . really hate old rooms . However the experience turned out to be much better, maybe because i got a room on the club floor , room was very new and modern. took a peak at the other floors, did look much more dated."
3,1715,Nov 16 2009 	Luxury with a view	An exquisite experience of comfort and excellent food. It was a very memorable trip.
4,1715,"Nov 11 2009 	Despite musty smell Taj Palace a delight	I recently stayed for 3 nights at the Taj Palace. The welcome I received was extraordinary, and I soon learned that the exceptional level of service was consistent throughout the hotel. I stayed on the Club floor, which was outstanding. Every time I returned to the room, I found fresh towels and ice in the ice bucket. The room gadgets are handy and internet service is faster than in any other Indian hotel I've stayed in. Only negative is the musty smell, but hey, this is India and I got used to it pretty quickly. The &quot;one free outfit press per day&quot; is a convenient touch. Restaurants are great, gym is well-equipped and open 24/7, and the Club Lounge on the 7th floor is a great place to relax, read and have a drink and a snack. While not inexpensive, the Club floor at the Taj is my new &quot;spot&quot; in Delhi."
5,1715,Nov 7 2009 	worst hotel in new delhi india	i always stay at the taj mahal but this trip there was no places so i had to stay in the taj palace and it was the worst stay i had and the worst people and there all lier's and they dont keep there word on the phone bookings for a rate of 400$ a night in a club room its really something very bad very very bad i will not ever go there and i will never recommend it for no one and who ever is reading this dont ever go there its really the worst place in all india a 4 star hotel is better then the taj palace.i hated all india from this stay and from the fights i had with them in the last day and every day.guys dont even think of staying there an advice from me to all..
6,1715,"Oct 18 2009 	Good still some scope for improvement	I had stayed here with my office mates for an International conference held in the hotel itself. The location is quite near the airport just opposite the Delhi Ridge, a small forest within the city. The rooms were quite large with good views of the city from the windows. The furniture and upholstery was average and looked a bit old and outdated, same goes for the washrooms. The food was excellent and in my view the best thing about this place is its food. The staff were not different from any other 5 star hotel, always smiling and ready to help. Overall I would recommend this one."
7,1715,"Oct 18 2009 	Not different to other big chain hotels	I spent 3 nights in October. There was a conference held here so this was the hotel chosen for the attendants. When I enter these kind of hotels I get the feeling I am in the same place. Lobbies are the same, rooms dont have a personality, fitness clubs and pools are bigger, smaller, but ....no big differences. So what I look for here is service.In this particular case my &quot;normal&quot; room in the 4th floor was quite old and it showed. The bathroom had a very old decor and in general it looked outdated although they placed LCD and some &quot;modern&quot; things. It was a clean room, which is also comforting.The difference I saw here was the personnel. Incredibly kind, always a natural smile on their faces, always trying to help you, a positive attitude you dont see always (frequent travellers will agree with me) in hotels.The price is quite expensive if I had to pay from my own pocket. The pool is quite big and there is a nice garden in the ground floor.Restaruants: Breakfast is a good buffet as usual, but for dinner avoid this same restaurant. Food is definetely not good there. The indian restaurant (in my opinion) is on the expensive side but the food was great. I had dinner twice there, fortunately not so spicy. I missed the opportunity of dining in the new vietnamese restaurant since it was full every single night.Fitness club, ok.Have a safe trip!"
8,1715,Oct 6 2009 	Love the atmosphere	Hotel has very good staff with a very good atmosphere.
9,1715,"Aug 17 2009 	Hotel is still in 80's but its the staff who makes the difference	Taj palace hotels &quot;Earth rooms&quot; are the worst, they dont have mini fridge, although there is a mini bar without soda, softdrinks and ice. Extra bed looks very much like hospital bed. Hotel is still in its 80's where aminities are concerned. By the way Swimming pool had insects in water.Food is great in the restaurants, but they need to mention the cuisine name on menu cards of Kafe Fontana.If atall what makes Taj a memorable experience is its wonderful and well trained staff."
10,1715,"Jul 8 2009 	Luxurious	We stayed in one of the club rooms at the Taj Palace in 2007. We had 3 nights relaxing here before returning home after a tiring tour around Rajasthan. A wonderful greeting from the staff on arrival with a very quick booking in and escort up to our room. The staff were always very courteous and helpful.Our room had a lovely view over the pool area and was generally quite spacious with an open view over the bathroom (with optional screen in the form of an electric blind) - all very modern and quite impressive.We had a comfortable and very luxurious stay and with complimentary Molton Brown products in the bathroom I could quite happily have remained in the hotel indefinitely.The hotel itself is also equipped with a lovely outdoor pool and mini golf area. An indoor fitness centre and several wonderful restaurants. The decor is modern but luxurious in a way which reminds you that you are in such exotic surroudings, and although it is not very centrally located it is only a short trip by taxi (or rickshaw for a little more thrill-seeking!). Although less enjoyable, it is probably advisable to get transport arranged by the hotel (both safer and cheaper - as locals assume you have money to burn if you stay here be prepared to be &quot;ripped-off&quot;).The hotel otherwise - definitely worth it for a special occasion. The club room we stayed in was certainly worth the money although I'm not sure whether other rooms would match up as well."
11,1715,"Jul 7 2009 	10 year Honey Moon	Great Hotel, Great People, Great Service. One of the Best I have ever stayed. Beautiful hotel in a very nice place in Delhi."
12,1715,"Jul 1 2009 	1 star rooms for a 5 stars price	had to stay there for a conference.this hotel is a joke, the prices are up to the roof and the rooms are in such a terrible state:very small, hardly any place to walk around the bed, the tv must have seen the 80's, it is so old.the bathroom tops everything:the tub was clogged, and so was the washbasin.the toilets must have been built for giants, sorry to give such graphic details but you can hardly stay in a sitting position on them because they have been designed to be so high.nothing works, we had to call several times to fix the internet connection and wait forever to get it done.and all we hear all day long: &quot;we are sorry, we are sorry&quot;there is no way that this hotel should be given 5 stars, it is a joke.the so-called fitness center is just that : so-called."
13,1715,"Jul 1 2009 	Top Notch Hotel	Great place to stay. We were only there for one night before we left for the airport, but it's a beautiful place. The lobby is huge, three restaurants, a bar, a mini-golf course in the back, nice pool, very safe, rooms were huge and very comfortable, staff was very friendly. I'm not sure what we paid since we booked through a private tour, but I'm assuming it was a lot..."
14,1715,"Jun 27 2009 	A HOTEL WITH TOP QUALITY SERVICE IN ALL AREAS	My wife and I spent nearly two weeks in Delhi attending a friend's wedding, located partly at the Taj Palace and partly at The Oberoi Hotel.Despite the marbled opulence of the Oberoi, we felt that the Taj Palace possessed a warmer and more personal ambience, with a higher level of attentive and cheerful customer service.The Tea Room was an absolute delight for taking typically English afternoon tea and cakes (although the ninety two varieties of tea on offer were bafflingly large.) The Orient Express had a fantastic dinner menu served up in a most luxurious setting, although there were three other more modestly priced eating options within the hotel to suit every taste and size of pocket.The bathrooms could possibly benefit from a refurbishment/upgrade if judged at the highest level, but otherwise the rooms were spacious and well serviced.Our final transfer to the airport was potentially marred by the non arrival of an outside taxi booking, but the friendly and helpful hotel concierge not only organised a replacement vehicle literally within a minute, but also contacted the airport to put us on fast track ticketing priority such that we made our flight with a few minutes to spare. Tremendous service of the highest order."
15,1715,Jun 18 2009 	Great hotel	i liked my stay...overall experience was excellent...so was the staff...i think the sticking feature is the spacious hotel rooms and total area...
16,1715,"Jun 13 2009 	Exquisite hotel with countless amenities and fabulous service!	My husband and I were delighted with our stay at the Taj Palace Delhi. Everything from the room comfort and cleanliness to the food, from the service to the amenities and the concierge to even the medical care, exceeded our expectations. My husband got sick with a fever and upset stomach toward the end of our stay. The hotel sent a doctor to our room within an hour, who conducted a thorough check-up, made an assessment and provided us with numerous options and resources should my husband require further attention. As the doctor predicted, my husband, after hydrating and eating khichri (as recommended by the doctor), was better the following day, and we could enjoy the rest of our trip outside of the hotel room. While I wish sickness upon no one (especially while traveling) you can rest assured that in such an event you will be well taken care of at the Taj Palace Delhi."
17,1715,Jun 13 2009 	Loved the arrangements	The Hotel has a very good ambience. The cooperativeness of the hotel staff very good. The food at the hotel is good and have quite a bit of varitety in the food. However the veg food could have been more better.
18,1715,Jun 12 2009 	Comfortable Stay	Nice ambience specially the green view from room.Food was excellent
19,1715,Jun 9 2009 	Taj becomes an addiction	It is located in the heart of the city. The hotel is well connected to the airport and all other important locations one has to go see around Delhi.If you wish to indulge in nice western cuisine...try the the Orient Express located in the hotel lobby. This restaurant features an actual dining car from the famous Orient Express train.
20,1715,"Jun 8 2009 	Great Hotel Very costly for one day business trips	Very great hotel, best in the class and luckily i got the mini-executive room with free wine, chocolates and the room view.But the hotel rates are very expensive during the peak period and for one day business trips it can be very costly for your company.But the best place or hotel in Delhi, no doubt.ciaoronak"
21,1715,"Jun 8 2009 	Late night arrivals	Arrived late evening, after a long, tiring day at the Taj Palace, New Delhi. I was checked in pronto. Was also pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the Club Lounge with its own concierge and club lounge where continental food is laid out each day.The club lounge also is a good location to have business discussions over nibbles or a meal, depending upon the time of day.The service, as in most Taj properties was incredible. I have now got so used to the pampering received at Taj properties in India, that I would hate to stay elsewhere. The property is brilliantly located for all of my work. It is indeed a beautiful property replete with all one could ask for, be it shopping or fitness/relaxation related faciliities. My only regret is that almost all my visits to this hotel have seen me getting into the hotel only late in the evening - just enough time to hit the sack and leave early morning.  The pool is lovely and luxurious. There's someone at your beck and call for your every need whilst in the pool, including laying out titbits or a drink, if you need one.Restaurants are greatThe other facilities do not lag behind in terms of facilities. The main shortcoming is that rooms are not easy to get at short notice. However, thanks to the current slowdown, this issue stands addressed."
22,1715,"Jun 6 2009 	Excellent Service	I just returned from a Delhi trip last week where I stayed at the Taj Palace.I must say the service is truly excellent.Though I must share with you that the rooms on the 3rd floor still look the same (though in good condition still &amp; well maintained) as they did when I stayed there in 1990'sThey could do with renovation.The Orient Express Resturant was excellent, so was the coffee shop (which could again do with some renovation). The Masala Art - indian resturant well .. food is good, but decor needs 100% change - not at all on par with the &quot;taj standards&quot;.Got my Laundry back in 3 hours, and well done!Overall I must say value for money, but service truly excellent .."
23,1715,"Jun 4 2009 	Taj Club - A wow experience !!	This was the 2nd visit to the Taj Palace &amp; because i has enrolled into their program was given a Club room to stay on. As usual the check in process was a breeze with no documentation because this was my 2nd stay...the hostess came till the room to explain everything and make me comfortable.Dinner was alone in the room &amp; the room service gave me an option to go for a non veg spaghetti meal which came before the time mentioned by them &amp; it was yum!!! The meal was just right for a night meal with it not being too heavy which i dont like anyway......( most hotels dont actually look into this &amp; guess its a matter of getting to know your customers better ) Last time i had decided to take a walk next day morning but this time decided to try the gym, the manager there was at his courteous best helping with me just about everything &amp; at the end of my workout even told me to try the spa ( some of the services were complimentary ) which i unfortunately couldnt as i had to rush for work.Breakfast was elaborate with one of the best range of foods that i have come across &amp; even my friend who had joined me for the same couldnt help going on eating looking at the range.Checkout was perfect with hardly a minute to sort out all the bills.Great &amp; needless to say this will be a property which i will come back to again the next time i am in Delhi."
24,1715,Jun 3 2009	Great service	Great service
25,1715,Jun 3 2009 	LOVED THE GOOD FRAGRANCE	Fantastic Accomodation For Leisure &amp; Business Both. Pools Are Marvolous. The Hotel Is Very Clean And Decor Is Simply Great. Rooms Are Cosy With Modern Gadgets To Provide A Great Time.
26,1715,May 28 2009	Wonderful Palace	Taj Palace is a luxurious hotel with all the facilities presented in such a grand fashion. I had a wonderful experience with my family. The food was excellent and served well - The room service was perfect and was appreciated by all my guests too. I loved the beautiful ambience and the cusines.
27,1715,"May 25 2009 	The Power Of A Bad Habit	I am writing this to document the power of a bad habit and sheer inertia. You may not agree but you might sympathise. I have stayed at the Taj Palace for maybe a decade now, mostly for one and two nights.The good part is location, around 15 minutes dirve from the domestic airport, where I would award it 9/10. And that's unfortunately what I do end up paying the premium for.The good news ends there. The rooms are the most average (except the Club rooms which are a shade better) and have not been touched since perhaps 1995. The toilets, faucets, showers were installed at construction and have not been touched since. Or maybe the faucets were changed five years ago. The same goes for the carpets and the overall room upholstery.The rooms have that faint musty smell when you walk in and it stays that way for an hour or so. The air conditioners usually rattle, at least in my case on several occasions. Sometimes they rattle if turned on too high or too low. So the first half hour is spent trying to fix everything to one's requirements. Which if you arrive at 10.30 pm at night after a long day is not the most easy thing to do.There is no customer recognition to speak of. The Taj Group, I can testify in court, has the worst loyalty programme and is an apology for customer connect. No fresh fruits to greet a returning guest, not even a half-hearted attempt at recognition, nothing. To be fair, some other Taj Hotel properties do better.Obviously the problems get worse when you see what you pay and what you get. So its five-star prices and three to three and a half star feel and service. The restaurants have the similar, untouched, un renovated feel about them. The breakfast is okay, nothing to indicate anything special. And yet, I do end up staying here most of the time. Because as a business traveller, its still okay. I am waiting for a good alternative in close proximity. I am sure it will come."
28,1715,"May 25 2009 	Excellent but overpriced like most Delhi 5* hotels	Like the mid town cousin, this hotel too is over priced and around 20 mins from the centre of the city. But service is excellent if you can afford average rooms at 20000 a night."
29,1715,May 16 2009 	Top quality hotel	I was really impressed with this hotel. It's top notch: really friendly counter and restaurant staff. They seem gebuiely keen to help and not just after a tip. The hotel is very expensive (to stay and to buy food) but its quality shines through. The Indian restaurant provided the best food during our stay in India.
30,1715,"May 4 2009	Royalty at The Palace	The Taj Palace exemplifies India's rich cultural heritage and the amazing levels of Service &amp; Guest Relations that are so typical of Taj Group of Hotels.The expansive marble lobby of Taj Palace is imposing, as are its rooms (specially on their newly renovated Club Floor). One feels Royal, the moment one enters and a stay here (like in the old Taj at Mumbai) is an experience. A must for all foreign tourists visiting India.More expensive than most other Delhi Hotels, possibly due to its grandeur or its location at Diplomatic Enclave, this one typically costs around US$400 per night for regular rooms, while the Club Floors are around US$600.The Rooms were well equipped with large LCD TV, DVD player, Internet, Bose Stereo &amp; Bose WorldSpace Radio sets. Apart from the customary welcome drink on arrival (in-suite), we were greeted with flowers, a fruit basket, cookies &amp; a bottle of Chilean Wine. The mini-bar was well stocked, as was the tea/coffee maker. The newly renovated bathrooms have modern fitments and ample toileteries. The Club Lounge was being renovated, but, we were invited to the open bar in the Verandah, where, the choicest Wines, Champagne &amp; Single Malts were liberally poured for us along with some delectable hors'de'vours. The Chef at the Coffee Shop prepared excellent Lebanese fare for us &amp; I found it very reasonably priced. The Tea House of the August Moon is a speciality Asian restaurant and famous The Orient Express is also there for continental cuisine &amp; wines.Excellent Service levels all through. The Taj lives up to expectations with her hospitality."
31,1715,"May 3 2009 	old but still ok	The hotel has the old world charm about it , but is now getting a bit creaky, while the rooms are large &amp; airy, the carpet on the floor is a bad idea.Love the LCD TV, but its installation on top of old furniture and all old furniture in the room is a bad idea.Missed the shower cabin, but location and breakfast is still great."
32,1715,"Apr 30 2009 	The Coffee Shop is outstanding. Ambience and Food are superb.	The Taj Palace made our 1-day stay memorable. All around, spick-and-span surroundings and a delightful environment.I was happy to see the security arrangements too, just like at airports. Baggage screening and frisking, all done efficiently. Obviously, Housekeeping and Room Service were flawless. However, the only facility i would want as a tourist is an inclusive Transport Service to and from the airport. For such a prestigious hotel, it is easy to provide."
33,1715,"Apr 29 2009 	Good Business Hotel	Good business hotel, located clsoe to the airport in the diplomatic enclave. Service was OK, what you would expect from a good Asian bsuiness hotel. Bathrooms are small need to be updated."
34,1715,"Apr 29 2009 	Great ambience	A top rated business hotel. Ideally located, away from the traffic jams. The Rooms are big and spacious. Taj hotels are known for courtesy and good food. It's really a home away from home.The Hotel facilities were more than sufficient to launch my product. The arragements were superb. Separate entrances to the halls was really helpfull."
35,1715,"Apr 28 2009 	Great food	When I was at taj it was great like any other 5 star.The restaurant called masala art was great.From music to food to performance.Great hospitality.Due to economic slowdown all hotels have dropped their rate,so it should be cheap now to stay."
36,1715,Apr 27 2009 	The surrounding greener and garderns were nice. Pool side sitting arrangement.	Taj Palace is in the midst of a beautiful greenary though man made. The hanging creepers in the pool side tables is a real treat to the eyes. Loved the hospitality of the staff. The facilities in the room were excellent.
37,1715,Apr 26 2009 	Standard Taj	Delhi is the only city where I think the Taj properties have serious competition from others and they just don't cut it.This is a solid business hotel but nothing about it stands out besides the usual high standards of Taj service.The other contenders in Delhi are The Imperial (amazing) and Le Meridien and Shangri-La are also better than the Taj properties.
38,1715,"Apr 21 2009 	Staying at Taj becomes an expereience in itself.	The great thing about this hotel is its convenient location. Easily approachable from the airport or the railway station. Very nice and wooded surroundings ... something of a rarity in N.Delhi. So itsa 5 star but somehow lacks the amenities or services a wee bit, that one would expect from such a hotel.My experience with this hotel goes way back so im not sure how much has changed since then.Room service is decent .. but could be a bit better. Food is great .. the buffets are a must try.Room decor needs a little upgradation, something a little more ostentatious. The lobby is big and just too open for comfort ... so much more could have been planned there.All in all if you were to choose between the neighbouring Maurya Sharaton and Taj Palace .... id say Maurya Sheraton is where i would prefer to stay."
39,1715,"Apr 18 2009 	Good Service	Taj Palace Delhi is a Hotel that I frequent. They take good care and the service is really great. I enjoy the hospitality and care they take. The rooms other than Club Class are a wee bit small , so if you like your rooms to be of decent size choose the club class."
40,1715,"Mar 29 2009 	Taj Quality but poor location	A nice hotel, with a good breakfast buffet, but it's located in the embassy area of Delhi, so there's nothing within walking distance of the hotel... boring! I would prefer to stay somewhere with more activity (and cheaper!)"
41,1715,"Mar 20 2009 	Good 4 star	As with most hotels in Delhi, very high security existed. Hotel is not close to any major sites, located in the diplomatic community, about halfway between airport and central sites. However, roooms were very clean, service excellent, food (esp breakfast) superior. Our only real complaint is the street noise (horns) hearable trough the windows."
42,1715,"Feb 20 2009 	great service though minor flaws	grand lobby. fantastic restaurant. great service. average room amenities. hotel staff are very attentive at all time. when they make a mistake, they would proceed with the service recovery promptly. some minor flaws do happen from time to time, but i can see the management is committed to provide each guest with maximum comfort."
43,1715,Feb 19 2009 	Fantastic Hotel excellent service. will definitely go back	Stayed at the Taj Palace Hotel for a week with my wife and 3 kids. Perhaps one of the best hotels that I have stayed at in all my travels. The rooms were comfortable and the hotel lobby is very impressive. The Taj hotels are known for their service and this hotel is no exception. The service at the restaurants was spectacular. We had the chef stop by every day asking us if the food was good and the waiters were exceptionally attentive.
44,1715,"Feb 12 2009 	Very good- and an upgrade twice!	I stayed at the Taj Palace hotel as part of a tour for two nights- once at the start of my trip and once at the end. The hotel was not quite as grand as the Taj hotels in Mumbai where I live, but it was still very nice. It was very quiet when I was there and both times we were all upgraded to club rooms, which was fantastic. The rooms were very plush with great views- the only thing was that it was so high tech it took me a while to work out how to use the lights and the bath etc!! The private club breakfast room was superb, the business lounge was excellent, the room service excellent and I loved the little touches like being brought chocolate cake and straberries in the afternoon! Also, Molten Brown toiletries... lovely. The restaurant was fine but better than the food was the service- very friendly. Recommended for a stopover or business trip in Delhi."
45,1715,"Feb 1 2009 	Fantastic hotel	This has to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The room was fantastic, the staff were great. The hotel is spotlessly clean."
46,1715,"Jan 7 2009 	Not quite 5 star	Stayed here for one night only and that was enough. Strong and overpowering smell of fragrant oil everywhere. Exterior gaudy facade design and old paintwork make it look tired and unappealing. Entrance lobby is good but elevators leading to rooms, gaudy carpets in corridors and tackily painted walls and doors require a major upgrading job and more emphasis on detail. Rooms are no more than 3.5 to 4 star level. Room entrance door and cabinet work is gloomy and need replacement. Colour coordination of furniture, floor carpet, curtains is not to my taste. Breakfast is okay but not lavish in a bright red floored dining area as if designed by team from 'Changing Rooms' TV programme.Acceptable place to stay if price was say 100 a night."
47,1715,"Dec 31 2008 	Nice Hotel pretty average!	We stayed at the Taj Palace for 2 nights. This was our first stop on our 11 day tour of India as part of our honeymoon. The hotel is in New Delhi and resides within a residential area. We felt very safe at the hotel, there are guards at the main gate and even security staff at the reception area. We were told that the hotel gets a lot of Government officials staying there.The lobby is lovely and looks rather impressive with a large Chandelier. The rooms were pretty average and what you would expect from the standard hotel. We felt that the room we stayed in (3rd floor) was a little tired and could do with sprucing up. I am quite allergic and sneezed a lot in our room- my sure sign of dust lurking. They did give us a bunch of red roses and also a cake to congratulate us on our wedding- which was nice.Service was good and the food in the restaurants was of a good standard- though as is the case in most Indian hotels you pay a lot for such standards.Overall pleaseant stay- not bad a a stop over hotel."
48,1715,"Dec 4 2008 	i love this hotel stay and enjoy alot	Room Amenities: The hotel has round 100 villa rooms in Portuguese-Goanese design all air conditioned and set in beautifully landscaped gardens. All the villas are elegantly appointed, have international direct dial facility,music, cable TV, Room service and laundry serviceDining: For the foodie there is The Banyan Tree serving Thai and Chinese cuisine; The Beach House for Continental, Indian and Goan cuisine and Caravela the bar.Hotel Facilities: Other facilities provided by the hotel includes a fitness centre, swimming pool, indoor and outdoor games, travel desk, car rental, shopping arcade, currency exchange, doctor-on-call and baby sitting. Meeting and banquet facilities are also available"
49,1715,"Nov 29 2008	Nice clubrooms reason to stay here	Took a club room, a very good buy. Newly renovated, beautyfull bathrooms, seperate shaower and tub, shower with rainforrest shower head. All in black marbel. Beds nice , duveets and pillows wonderfull. The butlerservice comes with the room, check in in the room, and fresh juice at arrival. The club lounge ok, free drinks and internet.The service in the italian restaurant not always that good, but as clubbenefit, you can take breakfast in the lounge. But in the restaurant the service was sometimes grumpy, sometimes very sloppy- and at times very good. The food fine. The poolarea ok, the beautysalon with good service.If we hadn't had a club room , we had no reason to come back - but its closer to the airport than some of the others.."
50,1715,"Nov 27 2008 	5 star service 5 star price	You get exactly what you would expect from a hotel like this. Top service, impeccable room, high prices. Must be one of the better hotels in the city.The level of service is in fact a bit over the top: someone to turn on the tap for you in the public washroom to wash your hands and hand you a fresh towel; staff do not give directions here, they take you all the way where you want to go; at receptions, you will be offered something to eat or drink about every thirty seconds, making it almost impossible to hold a conversation with anyone; everybody greets you, even the workers painting the halls, etc. After a few days, I could barely take it anymore. But I can hardly complain, I guess.Bed sheets were wonderful; the room, impeccably clean. The main Indian restaurant had great food, highly recommended. The European restaurant is where breakfast is served. Always some Indian food available for breakfast which was great. The rest of the breakfast was fine, but not extraordinary.Location is not that great. Hard to walk anywhere interesting. Taxis are cheap and readily available at any time, so that makes it easier to go somewhere.No surprise on the price either: it is expensive.My meetings where at the hotel for four days, so I did not have much choice. Not sure I would come back though if I were on my own though. I thought everything was a bit too much for my own taste. Something a little more casual might just feel a bit more real."
51,1715,"Nov 17 2008 	expomania	The taj palace at delhi is an exotic hotel with all the luxurious facilities one can even wonder of be it the spa, gym or swimming pool. the restaraunts offers a multi-cuisine buffet with all the delicious dishes from around the world. the attractive ambience of this place keeps you adhered to it and would surely make you stay more than you would ave expected to ."
52,1715,"Nov 11 2008 	Not that great really	We stayed twice at the Taj Palace for two days each time in Nov 2008 . We were in the ordinary rooms on the third floor. The room was OK nothing special. The rate for this room was 19000 a night plus [ very considerable] taxes - thats expensive anywhere for what you get here.The hotel is in the middle of the diplomatic enclave and armed troops and security guards are everywhere. Its a long way from other places to go or eat. We found the service like other reviewers have a bit too attentive, it starts to get on your nerves after a while though most of the staff are very nice if a little &quot;give me a tip&quot; oriented.The food is poor not to say terrible . We tried the Indian Restaurant and it was the worst and most expensive Indian meal we had in a month in India. No pappadums for example and dry tastless biryanni.The buffet breakfast is average for this standard of hotel - no special touches as you find in other similarly priced hotels. They run out of everything [ grilled tomatoes for example] all the time and it takes forever and 10 requests before they fill the dishes back up. Best of luck if you want an egg with your breakfast - three staff stood in front of the egg chef filling in forms when I tried - it seems you have to get a member of the waiting staff to get an egg for you as you are just ignored if you stand there.We tried the same restaurant at night for a buffet meal - but where they cook the main course to order for you. As at breakfast its completely chaotic. You have no idea who is supposed to be serving you. Knives and forks are nowhere to be seen and are mostly missing from the table . Our waiter &quot;cleaned&quot; the table by giving me a used a stained place mat and ignored the crumbs and bits of food laying on the surface. He and the myriad of layers of different kinds of waiters watching were completey unfazed when I took a cloth and cleaned up the table myself.We ordered the main courses specifically to be mild. When they came they made the hottest mexican dish seem like milk shakes - they were mind blowingly spicy. The lamb dish came as straggly little bits of meat with lots of little bones in it - really truly awful food.We were offered replacement dishes when we said we could not eat the main courses. I ordered a rissotto with prawns which was microwaved to the point of explosion making the prawns like bits of car tyre and my wifes so called French onion soup was thin and small.The raita was the worst I tasted in India - there was no chutney at all for the over spicy pappadums.All in all it was very poor l food and chaotic untrained service..We had booked at the hotels flagship restaurant which is in a replica carriage of the Orient Express and so named. Its $100 a head minimum but our experience with the rest of the food over 6 meals was so bad that we cancelled the booking. The bar service is equally bizarre and annoying. There is a nice seating area outside the reception.near the pool area. We sat there and asked if they had diet tonic for the G and T's as the full fat is too sweet and full of calories. No they did not have it. OK two Bacardis and diet cokes please. Five minutes later the waiter came back to say they could not serve that drink there. He offered us whisky or brandy or wine but claimed thay were not allowed to serve a bacardi and coke there - and we would have to move indoors to the Orient Express bar to obtain that drink. We did not want to drink in the inside bars as the ac is set to Alaska levels and its freezing cold and it was a pleasant evening to be outdoors. Why on earth the waiter could not go and get us the drinks and serve them where we sat was never explained. We spoke to one of the the hotels charming hostesses who greet you or arrival about this incident but she clearly had no idea why this was and she seemingly had no influence over the hordes of differently garbed bar staff most of whom appear to do nothing at all. We went inside for our drinks. Stay somewhere else for this money. Our guides told us the Imperial has much better food. Or save money and stay at the Amber where we also stayed during this trip and which we have reviewed on here."
53,1715,"Nov 10 2008	Not a 5-star experience	Stayed in a suite in a non-club floor. Room was spacious and well-appointed. Liked having a separate dressing area. The bathroom was not up to par for a luxury hotel. Although it is reasonably sized with separate tub &amp; shower, it is lacking in several areas. First, it looks incredibly dated (70's style). The water temperature was very erratic: shower took 5-10 minutes to get warm, but tub was warm instantly. THe drain pipes are too small, so the shower fills up with several inches of standing water while your wait for hot water. The toilet makes gurgling sounds after flushing. The maintenance staff agreed that the drain pipes are insufficient.Overall, service is generally attentive, but somewhat erratic. The breakfast buffet is fairly chaotic: just getting coffee is a 5-10 minute process &amp; the rest of the food is okay. Had generally good service at the front desk until checkout. The credit card company required a call (as often happens when using your card for a large charge in a developing nation). The clerk said that nothing could be done &amp; insisted that we call the credit company ourselves. Not exactly 5-star service. After some prodding he finally called the credit card company &amp; everything went through.I would probably not stay at this hotel again. Rooms are overpriced for what you get. However, I did become a convert of the Taj Group after staying at several of their palace hotels in Rajasthan. So, I would look for a smaller or newer property."
54,1715,Nov 5 2008	i love the service and presentation	i and my husband returned from my husbands friend house we saw the hotel the Hotel is very magnificient and we have never experienced never before. it was so lovely to see.
55,1715,"Oct 29 2008 	Overpriced.Will not stay here again.	It was for a conference that we chose this hotel because special rates were available.However, we were told those rooms were full so a more expensive room was proposed although the conference organizers insisted the rooms were still available.We were promised we would be downgraded if possible!It took 4 phone calls 24 hours before arrival to reconfirm my reservation.The 800 numbers I called didn't know about my reservation even though I had a confirmation number.The emails got returned as undeliverable.I was told to call direct to the hotel with a paid phone .It wasted 45-50 minutes the night before our departure from Paris.Pickup at the airport was quick.The staff is nice and friendly.Room smelled of tobacco,looked very old with an old TV.No wired internet,wireless internet you have to pay for.It worked okay the first day but then there was no signal.Someone came to my room and tried to check my laptop settings,he couldn't really tell why the signal was unavailable or low but thought it was due to outside interference.Toilets are too high otherwise okay.Food is very expensive and the hotel is far from any alternative food outlets.Staff presence: they hover around you at every step though you don't have to tip.Its just not very comfortable.Overall the hotel might have been a five star in the past but needs some changes now.You have to pay for using the business center as well.Fitness center very ordinary.I have traveled a lot and stayed at better hotels which were less expensive.,(usually in the US or Western Europe).Overall, overpriced. Need upgrades in amenities,downgrading in 5-star status"
56,1715,"Aug 9 2008 	Nice hotel service too attentive	We stayed on the club floor of the Taj Palace hotel. The rooms were nice and clean. We booked a hotel car from the airport and that went very smoothly. The driver was waiting for us as soon as we came out of customs. Check in was quite smooth. However, the service was too attentive. Every time I turned around, someone was hovering. I was also called multiple times (even after do not disturb light was on) to review the hotel!"
57,1715,Aug 5 2008	Staff stereotypes visitors	I have been staying at the Taj for a year now as a long term guest. The hotel has begun to stereotyping all female guests that come to visit. Having a girlfriend that works in a 5 star hotel she has been coming to visit for a year now. Every time she comes they treat her with a lack of dignity and respect. She is appalled at the way they treat people and said she does not understand how they still function as a five star hotel.There is a large group of people I work with that all stay at the Taj. Every one of them has had problems with the security staff.
58,1715,"Aug 3 2008 	Superb Service	From the start when I landed into Delhi International Airport [name of airport] to be received from the Taj Driver AND the Guest Relations Manager at 1am, that there was something special about this property and its service. We arrived in a standard car to be greeted at the door with exceptional quality service from the Guest Relations team who knew my name and also somehow worked out that I was very tired and I wanted little hassle to get to the room.I was guided to my room without any formality as it was to be taken care of in the room by my welcoming butler. I was upgraded non-the-less to the Taj Club and the service was beyond expectation.I felt royal, important and secure  the team at this property are the best I have ever experienced in all my years of travel.The room was appointed with the best quality fittings and in India where 5 star is a highly competitive arena  this Taj Property has got it right.The bed was luxurious, the mini bar reasonably priced, the food at the restaurants stunning. For a business hotel, this is the one to stay at  the room rate was around Rs. 11,000 (USD$250) a night so the value for money is certainly being served up to you as a guest.This is the only hotel to stay in New Delhi in my opinion.Pros: Service, Attentive staff, Great food, great little mini-golf course out back!Cons  None that I can think of"
59,1715,"Jul 26 2008 	Exceptional service at Taj makes you feel that you alone are staying in hotel	Taj group hotels are excellent by local standards but north american travellers may not find these exceptional in terms of interiors of the hotel.However, it is the service at Taj Palace which makes it stand apart compared to most north american hotels.Though not like a king but the prompt service makes you feel that you are the only person staying in the hotel.Also those who love to eat, food is excellent and buffet breakfast is very unique."
60,1715,"Jul 6 2008 	A bit tired	The restaurant service is good, typical of most Indian establishments. Rooms and hallways are a bit tired, and in need of a major upgrade (and soon!) particularly at the price the rooms are offered. Staff courteous."
61,1715,"May 15 2008	My favourite hotel in Delhi	This hotel is by far my favourite in Delhi. Though a little out the city, the atmosphere and rooms are superb and offer real luxury.Unfortunately, its pricing has forced it out of my budget, but if I were looking to pay that sort of price, this would be my choice. Rooms are great, restaurants welcoming and staff (as you would expect from Taj) are delightful."
62,1715,"May 15 2008 	Reasonable Hotel	I only stayed for one night at the Taj Palace on a very fleeting visit, so I can not provide a particulary indepth review. However, the only negative thing I would mention is that it is starting to look just a little bit tired...but only a little.The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the room comfortable and fairly spacious. It contained the usuals you would expect to find in a superior hotel, complimentary toiletries, fruit and chocolates. It makes a good airport hotel as it is only a 15 minute drive away. Not so good if you are looking to have shops, hustle and bustle near by as the area seemed quite quiet.There is a reasonable sized outdoor swimming pool, which alas I had no time to use but it looked most inviting!This hotel won't knock you off your feet but you will have a perfectly pleasant and comfortable stay."
63,1715,"May 10 2008 	Great hotel	arrived at hotel after long flight from newark..immediately escorted to club floor, and spacious suite. room , like lobby,was beautiful, amenties included snacks on arrival, robes, free happy hour in private lounge nightly. business centre facilities and staff were great. hospitality of staff exceptionally good...we were greeted at every turn by a friendly helpful person. breakfast buffet was enormous and of good variety. hotel restaurants were first class...esp good service in chinese restaurant. overall a very very very good stay"
64,1715,May 8 2008 	Too many problems for the price	The Hotel had a lot of problems for the price.1. They tried to charge for a airport pickup when I had arranged my own. I had too argue with them about this.2. Noisy renovations kept me up when I first arrived when I had a long flight and was trying to rest. Rattled the glasses on the desk.3. They couldn't fiqure out how to link two reservations and wanted me out when I was staying longer.4. The front office woke me up at 1:00am over some trival subject.Good points 1. Nice gym and workout area2. Good food at the Oreint Express
65,1715,"Mar 23 2008	one night stop over	We stayed one night at the Taj palace at the start of a weeks tour. The hotel doesn't look that great from the outside - a dit dated but the lobby is quite spectacular. When we arrived the hotel was fully booked with a conference and very busy which meant the service wasn't really that great. We needed lunch and the only place we could find to sit was by the pool, we waited a very long time to get served and the order was wrong which they quickly rectified. The room was ok, we had twin beds unfortunately. not particularly spacious and the decor non-descript but it was clean, one couple on the tour stayed in a club room and that sounded much better.We ate at the indian restaurant which was excellent, the service was very good and the waiters very helpful and keen to tell us about what we were eating, we asked to share a starter and they gave us two huge portions for the price of one and a free desert when we weren't going to have one. The bhuna ghost was lovely.All in all we were a little disappointed, we had thought this was supposed to be one of the best hotels in Delhi but i wouldn't say it was 5 star, it could do with a bit of updating and the pool area wasn't that great. We were supposed to go back there at the end of the tour but instead flew to Goa from Jaipur and were quite glad we didn't have to go back."
66,1715,"Mar 15 2008 	A property in decline	This is the second time I've stayed at the Taj Palace, but the first time was nearly two years ago. I thought it was a low risk choice however as last time wasn't too bad, but it has definitely declined.Check InWas swift, but their computer systems were down at the time so we didn't know if I got my room choice until we got in and could &quot;smell&quot; whether it was really a non-smoking room. Fortunately it was!RatesToo high... but then, hotels in Delhi are all very expensiveRoomSmall. Mine had new carpet (could still smell the glue) and new furniture but old TV and a bed that hadn't had a new mattress since the English got the boot. Tiny bathroom. An unusual complaint is that the toilet was too high off the ground. (I know, bad visual) but this was quite uncomfortable! Cheap shower curtain meant that the bathroom floor was usually wet.&quot;Bathroom smells&quot; passed into the room from adjacent rooms. Very annoying.GymWAY TOO SMALL! About 5 or 6 treadmills (lifefitness), 1 old lifefitness elliptcal and one new one, 2 bikes. At peak times the cardio gym was completely full with people waiting. The weight machines in the weight gym were obviously purchased by a purchasing guy who was trying to save money and while they are good quality, the &quot;set&quot; is incomplete, i.e. a quadricep machine, but no hamstring machine, etc.... as if only half of the requirement was purchased. With 4 guys in the weight gym it starts feeling very crowdedFoodAverage.Breakfast in coffee shop is a quite limited buffet and I sat outside one morning and was disturbed by a strong smell of human faeces coming from the nearby drain.Room service was prompt and efficient. Food was tasty.ServiceTypical for India. A few aggressively nice women working reception and in the lobby as a greeting function and no-one else really cared. Took about 5 tries over the first 2 of 4 days to train the restaurant staff how to make a good Caffe Latte. Still, each one seemed to take 1/2 hour! As per a few of the earlier reviews, the usual was handled well, the new or challenging was hardly handled at all. Delhi is frustrating and I'm about to draw the conclusion that there are no good hotels there. The Shangri-La is the only major hotel there that I haven't tried... so it must be the only good one, as the Taj just doesn't cut it... like most of the others - especially when the rate is over $500/night."
67,1715,"Mar 3 2008 	Below par	I chose the Taj Palace after reading the TripAdvisor reports. Many reviews were very positive - a number critical. On balance I thought the Taj Palace would be a good choice.It wasn't - the hotel is very expensive - the rooms old and well overdue for a renovation, although there are some that have been renovated they weren't on offer to me. The rooms are average in size, the walls thin which meant that noise travelled. The food equally expensive and average. The hotel is well away from the attractions of Delhi. The service was inconsistent, ranging from above average to plain ordinary. Simple requests were well handled, anything more complex or requiring a decision was impossible. I was less than impressed with a hotel that charges top dollar by any standard and falls short on what it delivers. Intuitively there must be better choices - look elsewhere."
68,1715,"Feb 20 2008 	A great disappointment	A hotel that charges a premium (in a low cost country) but fails to deliver. Yes, the rooms and the public areas are what you would expect from a 5 star hotel, but the attitude of the staff seemed to be how best can we separate our guests from their cash. There seemed to be no ability by staff to make decisions - everything was done by the rule book - and generally with no flexibility. Hospitality and graciousness were lacking. You left feeling &quot;used and abused&quot;.Very questionable price value."
69,1715,"Feb 8 2008 	Excellent service	Incredible service from everyone. The staff are immensly well trained and are extremely coutreous. The in service dining staff even make sure the food was well prepared and to your satisfaction an hour after you are served!!!The rooms are a bit tired and unless you have work in the diplomatic area, too far from most sights. The service no doubt makes up for alot though"
70,1715,"Jan 14 2008 	Nice hotel great service	I stayed at the Taj Palace for a day in June 2007. The check in process was smooth and fast. The room was about average in size but was decently appointed, though a bit frayed at the edges. The hotel was in the process of being refurbished. I wish they did not put off the refurbishment for so long! I used the room service and found the food to be good. The restraunt in the hotel is a fine one and my guests really appreciated it too."
71,1715,"Jan 7 2008 	nice hotel	The Taj Palace in New Delhi is a very comfortable hotel, with a few quirks. We booked 2 club rooms for a three day stay. Our rooms were rather small, but had been freshly updated with modern decor. There's an extensive and varied breakfast buffet, and snacks in the club lounge from 4 till 8 pm. The staff is very polite and attentive, but strangely uninformed; the concierge was unable to provide us either with alternative places to eat in the area, nor with any information about local tours of Delhi. Also, there's no information in the rooms about what is included in the Club Room price, and the receptionist didn't seem to know. The quirks? There are no clocks in the rooms, though the staff did manage to find a cheap alarm clock for us to use when we asked. The bathrooms are separated from the rooms by a wall of glass. There are shades that can be lowered, but these provide only an illusion of privacy - at night, especially, everything can be seen through the shades. This may be OK for couples that aren't shy, but was rather disconcerting for our opposite-sex teenagers who were sharing a room."
72,1715,"Jan 6 2008 	Great hotel	Cannot fault this hotel at all. Very nice rooms and common areas and staff always polite, coureous and attentive. Staff always greet you nomatter if busy. When contacted hotel to confirm booking they had wrongdates but said it would be fixed. When we actually arrived the wrong dates were still entered however this was fixed quickly - may have been the travel agent's mistake, who know.There is a great selection of restaurants and places to hang out inside the hotel. Always a great atmosphere. Great to tourists or business travellers. Room service is to die for as it arrived in a silver trolley. The waiter, wearing white gloves, laid out the table in the room and served the food. He even offered to pour the tea and put the sugar in. Amazing attention to detail.Great location. Would definately stay there again."
73,1715,"Jan 6 2008 	Great Hotel but some rooms need urgent renovation	We (a family of four) stayed at this Hotel for three night in total in Dec 2007 and Jan 2008, at the beginning and the end of a trip in Rajasthan.The first two nights, we stayed on the Club Floor (floor seven) and we enjoyed nice a spacious rooms, well equipped. On Jan 02, 2008, we stayed one night on floor three, where unfortunately the good memory we had from our previous stay instantly vanished at the sight of the worn out state of the rooms. The cleanliness was good, but you could tell that these rooms were oldish and needed renovation. We were disappointed.The staff was always very helpful and warm, attending to our needs. The lobby was great and luxurious contrasting with the rooms somehow.During our first stay, we were invited to share champagne with the floor manager (Club floor) and share our comments. Breakfast was very good, but we did not try the other restaurants nested in the hotel as they were quite expensive for a family of four.The location was good too, about 20 minutes from the international airport and 10 minutes from the city centre.If we ever go back, we will make sure that we stay in one of the refurbished rooms (but surely this bears a cost)."
74,1715,"Dec 29 2007 	A very good business hotel	I stayed here for over a week, and was overall very pleased.The room was spacious and very tastefully furnished, with plenty of complimentaryfood, mineral water, and amenities included. The spa and gym are extremely nice --one of the best I have experienced at a business hotel.There is certainly a lot of hotel service. From the hotel door to your room you will encounter a half-dozen (at least) staff who will ask you how things are, and whether anything can be improved. The staff provided me with a lot of timely help -- they brought things up to the room, made inquiries on my behalf, explained the use of appliances in the room. It is also true that sometimes their interest in helping was not matched by ability -- in a few cases, they seemed to be just reading from a script. This was particularly true in the restaurant, where staff would sometimes forget orders, or nod eagerly but misunderstand them.The number of &quot;feedback requests&quot; you get is oddly high, but I do have the impression that this hotel will continue to improve because of them.The hotel is not near any attractions -- you will require a cab to get anywhere. But I'm not sure there is a better location -- you cannot easily stroll in Delhi even if you are close enough to your destination.One of the things that may be confusing to travelers (I think it is reflected in the mixed reviews) is that although the public areasare very opulent, this is not a luxury hotel but rather more like a good business hotel (e.g. Marriott). The rooms are pleasant, but the walls between rooms can be a bit thin. Like a business hotel, they tend to overcharge for many extras (e.g. wifi, business services)-- actually, by overcharge, I mean that they charge exactly what I would pay in a business hotel in europe or the US. There is a travel desk which is really helpful with bookings -- something particularly important in India; they can solve train and air problems, book tickets, and arrange a car with driver. But they could not recommend or arrange tours or provide any useful advise on holiday issues. I have stayed in very few proper hotels in India, so I cannot say how this compares to the competition. ButI was happy to get to a place that was comfortable, run professionally, and where everything worked. The other hotel guests I met during my stay --- mostly business people -- felt the same. As long as you are not looking (or paying) for something more deluxe, this is a good choice."
75,1715,"Dec 28 2007	One of the best in the world	India is both beautiful and maddening. One of the best decisions I made when travelling there was booking this hotel. The service provided by the hotel is absolutely outstanding. From the check in right in your room, a great quiet room with internet, 24 hour room service with excellent selection and good food, fitness centre, and most especially the travel desk, every aspect of this hotel is near perfect. The travel desk alone is worth its weight in gold. Air India cancelled two of my flights (careful when flying out of Delhi with all the fog in December). The rude AI agent at the airport brushed me off, so I came back to the hotel and they sorted everything out. Their rep will even meet you in the airport to help you check in at no extra cost. Pay the extra money and stay in the Taj Club: it is well worth the extra pampering.Minor quibbles are that you pay for internet and the hotel is less centrally located. Nevertheless, I would stay again without hesitation."
76,1715,"Dec 25 2007 	Worst Hotel Stay for the price	Having stayed in more hotels then I can count, I have to say that for the price paid to stay at the Taj in Delhi it was horrible!Service was horrid from arrival all the way till check out. The room was older then myself and not updated since. Food was average and nothing more. After traveling to the Taj Mahal with friends and kids in tow we stayed at the Trident Hilton in Agra, which was a wonderful hotel in all aspects. Great for kids, the service was wonderful, what you would expect. The Taj in Delhi on the other hand for all of us was a 2 star for the price of a 5 star....."
77,1715,"Dec 23 2007 	Receptinist is NOT a Taj hotel standard	I was invited to stayed at Taj Palace for four nights.The Interior of this hotel is definitely the Taj hotels standard.The Lobby is very spacious and fabulous with a lot of Indian paints on the display. Club floor room is also the Taj standard,with all the ammenities you would expect for a five star hotel.BUT the Recepetionist are NOT the Taj hotels standard. They are NOT helpful when I ask them the location of the shop to buy saree for my wife. I handed him a copy of newspaperad of a saree shop and I asked him the best way to go there.His reply was' You can take a taxi ' He did not show any intention of showing a map or asking someone eise for more information.I would not complain this sort of thing if it were not a Taj hotel. Hoping to check it soon."
78,1715,"Dec 16 2007	Stay Away Unless you Like Rats in Room	Stayed there after great experience with another Taj Hotel. Stayed on the Club floor and paid over $1,000 US for two nights in a very small room. The staff was very pleasant and well meaning, but you can tell a hotel when it comes to handing problems. At 1:30 am while working on my computer, a big, fat and obviously well feed rat scurried around the floor in my room and then into the bathroom. When I called the floor desk, they were helpful in moving me but no apologies and nothing from the manager. I then e-mailed the hotel after I left, along with Taj management offices and no responses. I am sorry, but if there is one big rat on the seventh floor (where they have some sort of food facility due to the club room), then there are likely more rats. It was not only amazing to me that I paid so much for a rat infested room, but the fact that there we no apology or even acknowledgment of my issue is really telling. I can understand a hotel can have an occasional problem, but to not even respond tot he guest is not acceptable. I have stayed at great hotels all over the world and this I the first time I had to deal with a rat infested room."
79,1715,"Oct 28 2007 	perfect service rooms need updating	the rooms are nothing to write home about, I didn't even bother to take photos as other reviewers' photos are representative of the state of the rooms, comfortable but worn out (i.e. carpet stains, dated bathroom)but all of that aside the hotel 's service was the best of the 3 hotels I stayed at on this trip (Oberoi Agra &amp; Samode Haveli in Jaipur being the other two) the travel desk (a lovely girl called Amrita) took care of my whole trip from train tickets to car pick up (airport, agra to Jaipur with sights along the way incl fatehpur sikri), plane tickets from Jaipur to Delhi &amp; etc, everything was seamless and response was quick, she even gave me her direct line as she saw me off in the morning for my local taxi to the delhi to agra train in case anything went wrongthe check in process was also painless, was greeted the moment the car arrived in the driveway &amp; ushered to the room for a quick in room check in + welcome tea + snackslike I said the rooms were a bit on the old side but the hotel lobby itself was fine (reminded me of the Mandarin in Bangkok)would I come back again? yes, if not for the hotel then at least for the efficient help from the travel desk"
80,1715,"Oct 23 2007 	You want customer service? You've got it here!	We stayed here for one night before heading off to Agra..and what a hotel it is.Beautiful, elegant, friendly and the customer service is second to none. When we checked in we were upgraded - for no reason, had breakfast thrown in for free - for no reason and complimentary champagne delivered in our room - for no reason! The staff were incredibly friendly and the hotel was stunning. Set in a good location, about a ten minute drive to the centre of Delhi. The grounds were neat and pretty and the pool was a good size and clean. The lobby and restaurants were of ample size and if ever we needed to stay in a hotel in Delhi again it would be this one over the Imperial, Shangrila and Oberoi any day."
81,1715,"Aug 26 2007 	'Yes it's fine please stop asking for feedback all the time!'	Spent a weekend here in August 2007. The hotel is absolutely fine and I'd stay here again. If you look in the dictionary under 'anonymous international five star hotel' you'll find something like this.Two things to be aware of though. The first is that the hotel is being refurbished - at the moment they are on the sixth floor, and construction is a thirteen hour a day, seven days a week job. They did mention this to me when I checked in, and with hindsight I should have moved rooms when they offered, because I was just downstairs from the drilling. Though if they knew this, why was I put there in the first place? So I'd just check on how the refurbishment is going before you book, and make sure you get a room away from the work.Also try to avoid the rooms overlooking the hotel entrance. Buses park there with engines and A/Cs running, waiting for tour groups. Indian A/Cs aren't the quietest, and they certainly disturbed my sleep, which was a shame as the hotel is in an otherwise very quiet location.Secondly, it felt like wherever I went in the hotel I was constantly asked what I thought of it. It gets difficult after a while to think of nice things to say, when you really want to say you'd much rather be left alone. They even sent me a detailed questionnaire by email afterwards to ask for even more feedback.When I got home to Mumbai, one of my friends who works in the (non-Taj) hotel where I used to live told me the Taj he used to work in had a competition with the Palace to see who could collect the most feedback. Not surprisingly he prefers his new hotel as he doesn't have to constantly pester his guests.Finally though, I would recommend the Masala Art restaurant - by far the best Indian meal I've had since moving to India. And no feedback requested either! They probably already know they're good."
82,1715,"Aug 4 2007 	Excellent in all aspects	Stayed for 5 days, and from the time you meet up with their Guy at the Airport Pickup, you experience the Service : which is of the highest level. The facilities both in-room and at cafe's and other venues within the hotel match the service as well. I get the feeling that the staff in all categories give the highest priority to Customer Service.They are willing to do the extra bit to make your stay comfortable.The food is also great. The only negative comment that I can make is that of the environment around it - there is no shopping opportunity within short walking distance, but on the positive site the hotel is located in the Diplomatic Enclave which makes it a safe venue. Additionally the hotel cab service (Rs. 50++ Per km, 1Hr Min Charge Rs.500) does a great job - so you can visit any place without any risk. The Drivers also speak basic English, carry cellphones etc which ensures that your drive is perfect as your stay."
83,1715,Jun 26 2007 	Impeccable Service	I stayed in the Taj Palace for three nights whilst in New Delhi on business. The service at this hotel is extremely good and cannot be faulted. I was offered complimentary ice cream and coffee with my meal last night and on arrival I was upgraded to a &quot;club&quot; room. The staff go out of their way to be helpful and everyone (without exception) is extremely courteous and polite. My room on the seventh floor had a very good view over the city including the india gate and the immediate area surrounding the hotel is green and pleasant. The main downsides to this hotel are that it is starting to look a little tired on the outside and the bathrooms and the spa are not 5 star quality (although at 220$ per night perhaps the rack rate reflects this). My bathroom in a club room was small and cramped and the fittings are probably at least 5 years old. Similalry the showers and toilets in the spa could do with being updated. Other things to be aware of: in Delhi a 25% tax is added to the room rate and 12.5% to all food and spa prices and 20% for alcohol so the overall experience is not as good value as you might originally anticipate; and you cannot really walk to anywhere from this hotel.
84,1715,"Jun 22 2007 	They Call This Place a Palace??	The Taj Palace may have been a luxury resort....in the 1980's! This hotel is so outdated and the decorations are so antiquated that I felt I had been taken transported back to the 80's. Whoever defines this place as luxurious has not been to a five star hotel in the past ten years. This hotel is certainly not a five star hotel, especially by today's standards. Its no better than an average Hilton or Marriot in any other city. I was very disapointed by my stay at the Taj Palace because I had heard so many good things about the place, but after having stayed at several Oberoi Resorts and other hotels in Delhi, it doesn't hold a finger in comparison. The service is not outstanding. In fact during my stay they notified me that they would be doing construction on the floor above us that would begin at 9 am. We asked if we could be switched to another room but was told that they were full, doubtful. The noise from the construction was atrocious. I've been at front row rock n' roll concerts and have been able to hear more clearly than I did at 9 am in my hotel room at the Taj Palace. The woman behind the desk apologized but that did very little. The hotel should be embarassed that they would subject any guests to such conditions. This is no hotel for those in search of a luxury or even a &quot;nice&quot; hotel. However, for families and people traveling on a budget I think the hotel would certainly suffice. The bottom line was that I was highly embarassed to have suggested this hotel to the group of people I was staying with especially after I had picked so many spectacular hotels like the Oberoi in Agra. It was a mistake and I would not return."
85,1715,"Jun 8 2007 	Taj Palace needs a reality check	There is an indifferent and sometimes absent hotel management response to long stay customers who object to constant construction noise. The food menus rarely change, and for the most part, the food is not good value for money."
86,1715,"May 3 2007 	Loved the Taj Palace	This is an excellent hotel, the service, the food and the ambiance are all amazing. We arrived in Delhi at 3:00AM therefore, we weren't allowed into our room right away. But the night manager leveled with us and said if we pay the rate for a regular room for that night he would give us a room on the club floor for the duration of our stay, and it was definitely worth it! The only bad thing I can say about the hotel was that my sister and I were mildly electrically shocked by two different socket in our room, it wasn't too serious, but it did leave us both a little frazzled, the Manager on duty immediately sent the hotel doctor up to see us, and changed our room right away, and were were transfered into a suit. The food at this hotel is great, the breakfast is the best I have had anywhere in the world, and the service is just beyond amazing. The entertainment at dinner was also great, we had a singer named Sebastian who was really nice and had a great voice. If you have a chance, try out the spa, we had a massage and scrub done and it was fabulous. Overall, we had a great stay at the Taj Palace!"
87,1715,May 2 2007 	Pleasant Stay	I stayed at the Taj Palace hotel on April 22nd while transitting through Delhi. The hotel staff were pleasant and professional as is to be expected from a 5 star property. I had booked a pick up and drop to and from the airport which was helpful. The room and bathroom were smaller than I expected but had all amenities. Bottled water and coffee maker were complimentary. I was put up on the fifth floor and although it was quiet throughout the night the noise started early in the morning and stayed through the day. When I complained it was explained that the hotel was renovating the sixth floor hence the noise. The noise was horrendous. It was load banging and I felt that the floor was going to come through. The hotel did agree to change my room for the rest of the day but as I was checking out later that day it was not worth it. The hotel itself was beautiful and the room service was excellent but the renovation really spoilt my stay. I had stayed at the Imperial last year and found that hotel to be better with more history and wonderfu artwork. If anyone is already booked at the Taj make sure you are not on the fifth floor or seventh floor. Apart from that the hotel was very good.
88,1715,"Apr 4 2007 	Excellent choice	This hotel is clearly one of the best in Delhi. While we were there, the hotel was hosting a conference for VIPs around the region. It was definately disconserting to be frisked upon entering the hotel and the guards with rifles on the roof, front gate and entry were distracting to say the least. However, the hotel upgraded my family to a lovely suite with a connecting room for our kids. The restaurants were first rate as was the pool and health club! We were trated very well. If I were to complain about anything, besides the armed guards, it would be that the electronic systems for lights iand showers in the rooms were way to complex! Having said that, it's a great hotel."
89,1715,"Mar 31 2007 	FANTASTIC Service and Hotel -- A great last night in India	My family of 6 stayed here for our last night in India. We had just come from a week trip on the Palace on Wheels and arrived at 8:00 a.m. in the morning. They were able to get us into a room at 9:30 a.m. (2 1/2 hours earlier than normal check in). We had 3 rooms and they placed us all on the same floor next to each other. We had a staff person come up for each room and show us the amenities of the room. We were extremely impressed. They even sent up complimentary cappucino and juice as a welcome gesture. The rooms were nice, not huge (like the Ambassador) but were comfortable). The service definitely made up for it.We wanted to have dinner at 6:30 since we had to leave at 3 am to catch our flight. They normally id not open that early for dinner, but made the arrangement for us to eat early. We ate at the tea house and would highly recommend it. The decor of the restauraunt is fantastice (very chinese). The food was delicious and they even brought our a complimentary cake when they found my parents were celebrating their 40th anniversary and this was our last night. They took our picture with a polaroid and even put it in a frame. The service was outstanding!As for the front desk and reception area, you could always find help. When we wanted to go shopping, one of the attendants (Rita) recommended we rent a taxi for the day (which I highly recommend). For 5 hours, she negotiated a rate for us which was 500 ruppees (about $12). She gave us pointers and was very attentive.My husband used the facilities -- pool, sauna, steam room, massage. It was a great experience for him. The massage was not too expensive, but well worth it. The locker area is separated for both men and women and there is a nice jacuzzi and steam room.Even when we left at 3 a.m. there seemed to be a full staff on duty. Overall, we LOVED this hotel and would highly recommend it. It was a bit pricey, but we thought it was well worth it."
90,1715,"Mar 20 2007 	First stay in India	Booked the Taj via Castle and King as part of one of their tours. Lovely hotel, room was clean, staff helpful and friendly, and food superb, particularly in the Masala art restaurant. Would definitely recommend."
91,1715,"Mar 5 2007	Very pleasant	Stayed for one night on Feb 25th, 2007. Based on comments in Frommers, which did not place this hotel into their recommended list of 5-star hotels in Delhi, was prepared for a so-so experience. Instead was pleasantly surprised to find the level of service and the facilities at the hotel to be truly first class. Given the choice, would probably still rather stay at the Oberoi, but this hotel is not far behind."
92,1715,"Feb 27 2007 	Long Stay - Great Experience	I stayed in this hotel for nearly 2 months and I would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to Delhi.The hotel is well staffed and has 4 restaurants, 1 bar and a lounge. It has a fairly large, well maintained swimming pool as well as gym facilities.During my stay, the hotel hosted a number of conferences and weddings, but it never seemed over-crowded or too busy.The rooms aren't massive but are big enough and the room keeping staff do a spectacular job.If you want something special, say extra water bottles each day, it is a good idea to have a chat to your room keeping staff, or if this is not possible, leave then a note with 100-200 rupees enclosed stating your request.A few of my colleagues had problems with their room bill - I didn't - so make sure you take a note of everything you charge to the room.The interent is expensive, so if you are staying for longer than a few days, make sure you ask about discounts for a wireless connection in your room for use with your laptop.The hotel is V-shaped around the swimming pool. Even numbered rooms face towards the road and entrance drive and can get the traffic noise. It's not too loud but may annoy some people. The odd numbered rooms face out onto the pool and although the view is better, they can be very noisy late into the night, when the hotel is hosting a function/wedding.If you are staying for a long time, or require additional space, ask about the availability of a corner room, which are almost double the size for the same price.The hotel uses swipe cards as access keys to the room. Make sure you get 2 and keep them away from your mobile phone, which has the ability to interfer with the magnetically stored information on the cards. Most people will have a problem with their access card during their stay, it seems never ending sometimes, but the hotel are usually pretty quick to send up someone with a new card.The hotel is in the diplomatic quarter, so at least a 15min drive from anything you might want to see or do. There is nothing within walking distance, so don't stay here if you were hoping to walk to India Gate or Old Delhi! Taxi cabs are readily available and if you can afford them, expensive hotel cars work around the clock."
93,1715,"Feb 16 2007	spring for club level!	the newly renovated club level is simply to die for. as a frequent traveler, I was bowled over by the level of service at check in and check out and the renovation of a business friendly, yet fun and comfortable room on the club level. Only issue we ran into was the fact we arrived a bit late for breakfast and the staff there was not at all pleased....that was a bummer for the price we were paying, special dining area or not. other than that HIGHLY recommend."
94,1715,"Jan 28 2007 	Five Star Service all the way	I stayed at the Taj Palace ten years ago, and thought it was okay -- nothing special. Now I'm actually AT the Taj Palace right now and I am overwhelmed with how wonderful the service is. I am staying in a club level room, and that is well worth the upgrade. You get free breakfast where you can order anything you like, you get butler service that makes you feel like you have a personal Jeeves, you get some free laundry services, and a free shuttle to and from the airport. Also free internet in the club itself. The rooms are exquisite-- fabrics are top quality, towels are fluffy, toiletries are plentiful. I just stayed at the Shangri-La in Manila, where they were pretty stingy with sub-par toiletries, so this was welcome. Also, the toiletries are Molton Brown, which I adore. The bathroom is all marble and granite, with a huge lit make-up mirror, which I really appreciate. The room is also spacious, with a desk and two chairs, including a loveseat, coffee table, and large flat screen TV.The view from the room is also amazing, right across the swimming pool and to the park beyond.My only quibble is that closet space for two people is rather cramped, and the bathroom could be a smidge bigger."
95,1715,"Jan 21 2007	Fantastic	Stayed here for almost two weeks, fantastic hotel.Service excellent.Particularly recommend the chinese restaurent, food absolutely wonderful."
96,1715,"Jan 6 2007 	soulless luxury	It is not easy to find a good hotel for a reasonable price in delhi. For the last two nights of our journey we chose one of the top hotels. The building is impressive spacious and the rooms are excellent, large and quiet. Five star standard perfectly. The staff is friendly and always next to you.On the other hand the hotel is far from the city center in the diplomatic area. Totally boring. The only place of interest is a cafe on the other side of the road where you can eat and drink ten times cheaper than in the hotel and meet some indian teenagers.The hotel itself is full of luxury but lacks of style and atmosphere. Cold as the marble flooring. It could be anywhere else.Our budget reservation via internet was without breakfast but unfortunately there is nothing in the surrounding where you can go for some snack in the morning. The opposite cafe opens at 10 am, so we had to smuggle some food into our room for the next morning.Funny thing, but as higher the accomodation price as more you have to pay additionally.The standard room charge is much overpriced, but you can find large discounts booking via internet."
97,1715,"Dec 11 2006 	Loved the Taj Palace	Right from the word go it was perfect. On arrival at Delhi international airport I was met and assisted by Taj staff who escorted me to the spankingly new Toyota. The hotel provides complimentary airport transfers to the hotel and back for those guests who stay on the Club floor. At the hotel lobby I was welcomed by Taj hostess who took me straight into my room on the 8th floor. All the rooms on this particular floor was recently renovated. You enter a different world altogether when you enter your room. It was done up quite painstakingly. It is the most modern hotel room that I have ever stayed in. Being a travel professional I have had the opportunity to visit and stay in many wonderful properties across the world. But from the standpoint of room decor, fixtures and fittings this one beats almost all. Bathroom amenities were in sync with the class of the room. The food outlets are absolutely top class whether the cuisine is Chinese (Tea House of August Moon) or Indian (Masala Art). Service was flawless throughout. All in all I had a great experience. I love the Taj Palace, the BEST in New Delhi."
98,1715,"Dec 5 2006 	Great hotel great service	I spent ten days at this hotel- on a business trip. It was my first trip to India and I was pleasantly surprised to be met at the airport by a car from the hotel, with a drink and hand towel to freshen up with. The hotel is in the diplomatic enclave of the city, and is well situated. The staff were extremely helpful and solicitous, and often took care of my needs before I knew I had them. The room was a standard double, but well furnished and very clean. The steward offered me fresh fruit juice to drink as he took care of the check-in details for me. There are several restaurants in the hotel, but my favourite was the Indian, which had a menu that went on for days. Again, the service was excellent. Breakfast was served buffet style in the cafe, and chefs would cook almost anything you asked for. There was western style food (bacon and eggs) as well as Indian, plus an array of cereals, fruits, juices (fresh squeezed), etc.From a business standpoint, the Business centre was well-manned and had everything necessary. It was located below the lobby, and was quiet.. The hotel also has a nice fitness centre (though I didn't use it) and a spa. I had two massages during my trip, both excellent- the Indian Traditional massage was extrememly relaxing, and the back/neck massage was just the thing after a long day in front of the computer. There is also a well stocked store in the hotel- with very nice quality shawls, jewelry, ties, books and other items you might need to take home to your family. Again, great service. There is a nice terrace outside, as well as a pool, which I did not use. I was very happy with my stay in this hotel. If I were to criticise anything, it would be the air conditioning, which I found a bit too cold. However, you can turn it off in your room in the evenings, so it was fairly comfortable in any case. That is a minor detail, though, and not enough to really complain about.Overall, the hotel is a nice, traditional large hotel that gives you a healthy dose of Indian hospitality."
99,1715,"Nov 2 2006 	Its Good!	Not bad at all!No, its really quite good!Reception is large, clean, modern and full of great staff, very helpful. They helped me find an obscure address in Delhi.Room was very comfortable and quiet, I had a good nights sleep here. Bathroom was also good.View out of the front was fine.Swimming pool is OK, some areas like changing area are getting a bit shabby and need a tidy up, but otherwise OK.Dinner and Breakfast was great, excellent buffet, lots of choice, good quality.Yes, I would stay here again."
100,1715,"Oct 10 2006 	A real luxrious Hotel	It is the best hotel i stayed in. The staff is too co-ordial and the gr8 thing about all the Taj in general is they take a personalised care about you. I went to Delhi for my competition and i was surprised that the staff also wished me before leaving for the venue. Spectacular rooms, nice srvice great ambience makes it all a wonderful experience."
101,1715,"Sep 27 2006 	An oasis of calm...	The Taj Palace is an oasis of calm in hectic Delhi. The staff are professional and friendly..... The Orient Express Restaurant lived up to its reputation as one of the top 50 Restaurants in the world, The food and service were excellent.The room was on the small side , but had good views over the pool.Overall a good stay... would use again when in Delhi."
102,1715,"Sep 12 2006 	excellent hotel for business traveller	Superb care and hospitality, great attentiveness, faultless luxury transportation to and from airport, very sound restaurants and exec areas. Very inspiring and much recommended."
103,1715,"Jul 28 2006	Good Hotel but	Stayed at this Hotel in mid June for two nights. It is an excellent property in an exclusive New Delhi locality. Had problems checking in, as our two-room reservation was not available due to overbooking. Were upgraded to a single suite room after some tough talk. The front desk staff need to shape up and cater to travellers needs in the unearthly check-in hours. The hospitality team more than made up for the tardy front desk staff. We were double billed for our stay, but then credit card companies will fix this.The property is great, the food is good, the location is great, but the front desk staff need to shape up."
104,1715,"May 28 2006	Absolutely Wonderful	This was our first trip to India and having read lots of reviews about the hit &amp; miss hotels, I wanted to stay at a more upscale, reliable place. After searching the net for places and prices, I came upon an amazing rate for the Taj Palace Club level rooms, and booked it at once (about 2 weeks prior to our travel). Our reason for travelling to India entailed some stressful experiences, so I wanted the hotel to be as stress free as possible.The Taj didn't disappoint. As a club level guest, everything was first class, and absolutely perfect. We arrived at about 1:00 a.m. local time, and the staff whisked us through the checkout and to our room - down pillows and overstuffed quilt, waiting bottle of wine, fresh fruit &amp; flowers in the room, electronically controlled lighting, an electronic safe and a special breakfast/tea buffet room only for Taj Club level guests.The amenities didn't end with these room/floor features. The staff was attentive without being obnoxious. We were never asked for a tip by anyone and were never pressured about anything. All the prices were exactly as stated and there were no hidden fees. The serving staff in the buffet room addressed us by name each morning and by the end of our stay knew what we wanted as far as food &amp; drink. Service was always readily available and when we encountered a problem (of our own creation) the hotel maintenance staff was right there within 10 minutes.The food at the hotel was absolutely wonderful. We had room service twice and ate at the hotel restaurants three other evenings. The only lackluster experience was in their Chinese restaurant. The Kafe Fontana was marvelous and the room service was without compare (white glove, individualized service). The pool and gardens looked quite inviting, but as the weather stayed cool throughout our stay, we didn't get to experience any swimming.Overall, this was one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had. Definitely a 5-star place with all the extras (and we've stayed in many hotels throughout the world)."
105,1715,"Apr 29 2006	loved this hotel	We stayed at the Taj Palace after a two week long trip through the North of India. This hotel is absolutely stunning, a true 5* hotel. The pool is great. We had a club room in which they give you free water and a bottle of red and fresh fruit. The room was perfectly fine. What I must commend is the service, this was the absolute best service ever. And mind you we work for an airline and travel a lot. The staff was so attentive. They actually told us where to go shopping which was the G.K-I market and/or the central market for steel products, the former has fixed prices and the best restaurant we ate in while in Delhi. The breakfast was very good. We had some kind of indonesian salad by the pool and that wasn't worth it. We had room service which was not good. The bar is expensive because of all the taxes on alcohol, just buy a bottle in the street(around $3) and mixers and you're good to go if you're a drinker. We also ate in Zen in C.P. and that was great chinese food. We used the same taxi driver the whole time we stayed at this hotel because he was so nice and honest. Mehar Chand-you can actually ask for him I think his car # 2738. 300 Rupees for 4 hours and he would pick us up when we told him every day. This hotel is expensive, but really all hotels in Delhi are...but it is definitely worth it...we also stayed at the Intercontinental Grand...and this one blows it away really. Also, if you are concerned about the hotel not being in the center...don't even worry about it...it's not an issue there because you really are not going to walk around....you will take cabs everywhere...the city is really dirty and extremely overwhelming.I hope this helps and have a great trip!"
106,1715,"Apr 7 2006 	Taj - Great hotel	Stayed at the Taj Palace in April of 2006. First night in India after a long 14+ hour flight. The hotel is very impressive and the staff is excellent and speak good English. We booked rooms in the Taj Club and were directed to the 7th floor for check-in. The only two complaints I can make about this hotel are 1) at 12:00 PM midnight, our rooms were not ready. After traveling 17+ hours, we were ready to sleep. Also, the bar in the hotel closes early, around 11 PM. However, you can walk next door to the ITC Sheraton, who's bar and club were great, where it's open longer.I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Booked a one day sightseeing tour through the travel desk. They were knowledgeable, friendly, and we had a great day. Rooms were nice, pool was nice, and lobby was comfortable. They even had a bottle of Italian red wine in my room as a greeting."
107,1715,"Mar 3 2006 	Great Servicerooms a little glum	Stayed at the Taj Palace in Delhi for 3 nights on a business convention.The hotel is very impressive and service really is superb.No request is too difficult for the ever-attentive staff.Hotel is huge with a great pool,restaurants,bars,night club and a shopping mall.Room was a little on the old fashioned side in terms of decor although has all the first class amenities i.e tv,wireless internet access,safe etc.All in all a safe bet in Delhi."
108,1715,"Feb 19 2006 	Expensive but..	After spending 10 nights, I can say:Ups: - the staff was very helpful and attentive. I needed some helpto clear my stuff at the customand they helped me. Generally speaking,the service has always been quick. - My room was very, very quiet. It is not a true luxury room but in the end it was OK, clean and big enough. - For people like me that cannot stand indian and spicy food, the evening buffet has always some continental food. The morning breakfast's buffet was excellent.- the bar and the business center are open 24hr a day.Downs: - at almost 300 eur. per night itis overpriced, but these are the prices in Delhi.I talked to many people and do not expect to finda five star hotel for much less.- the hotel is set in what is probably the cleanestpart of India - the diplomatic enclave - but you can'treally go out for a walk. The area is full ofdiplomatic and military buildings facing huge roadsfull of traffic. Overall I would choose the same hotel if I haveto go back."
109,1715,"Jan 30 2006 	Over priced	Went to stay at the hotel but was sadly let down by the price and state of the room as it was tired smelly and dirty, the staff were quite helpfull, but unable to offer better accomodation at the time and would not reduce the 280USD price, which in my opinion was excesssive, considering the state of the room"
110,1715,"Jan 22 2006 	Business trip	I stayed at this hotel in August 2005 and received excellent service. The rooms were very clean. The hotel has a good location and was close to the airport (15-20 minutes). The mini-putt course was really neat. The onsite restaurants were excellent as well. Good buffet and superb service. Overall, a nice stay at this hotel while I was in New Delhi."

2,1716,"Hidden Gem in New Delhi	We stayed in this hotel on our last night in India. It is about 13km away from Connaught Place and there is no metro station nearby, but we knew this before booking and choose to get away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi for our final night. An autorickshaw from Connaught Place will cost about Rs 80 (though you'll have to go to a pre-paid booth because most drivers will try to charge you at least Rs 150). The hotel will organise a taxi to / from the airport but it is much more expensive than getting a pre-paid car (which will be about Rs 250-350) depending on the terminal.The hotel was very nice. There is a great rooftop area where you can eat and drink (the staff will go out to get beers for you at Rs 75 each) and have view of the Lotus Temple. Breakfast is buffet style in the lobby. The rooms are spacious and modern with a proper king-sized bed, feather duvets, flat screen television, and large bathroom. The only fault is that there was a slight smell of sewerage, but this came from outside. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi and have a quiet, relaxing night somewhere. Do your sightseeing during the day and head back to this oasis."
3,1716,Lovely and helpful staff!	We stayed in the Amber for a total of 5 nights and loved it. The people were very service oriented and helped us ease life in Delhi. Delhi is a bustling city but the hotel is an oasis. Check out the roofgarden when youre here.
4,1716,"THE place to stay in Delhi	We found The Amber on tripadvisor, when we were looking for a nice and quite place in Delhi to spend our last four days in India after travelling three weeks through Rajasthan.The Amber is located in a very silent neighbourhood but all hotspots are easy to reach within 20 minutes. The Hotel is really beautiful, a wonderful mixture between western and indian style. The beds are very comfortable and the rainshower is amazing. With really hot water, heated with solar energy. And also the ayurvedic beauty products are great!But the best at The Amber is the really friendly and helpful staff, who is making everything possible. We wanted to do a daytrip to Agra and they tried everything to arrange our traintickets for the next day. Since this didn't work they organized us a driver and guide for the Taj Mahal so that we had a wonderful trip.And last but definitely not least: the FOOD which was really amazing!! I had vegetable shahi korma for four times, because i liked it so much and the cook always made it a little bit different for me, so that i won't become boring. All the other dishes were delicious as well. I would have loved to take the cook home with me ;-)So whenever you come to Delhi you should stay at The Amber. It is definitely in one league with all the big names in Delhi, but it is way more friendly and reasonable in price."
5,1716,"Why is there so much hype about this place?	The place doesn't measure up to the rave reviews it seems to get. It is far from the airport. Interiors of rooms are fine, but the window is so small as to make it feel like sleeping in a basement. Service, quality of amenities just doesn't quite make the grade of a 'great' hotel."
6,1716,"A Quiet Oasis in Delhi	Amber is one of a kind in Delhi. Quiet, contemporary, comfortable, clean. It excels in all areas. Mukesh the manager and all of the staff are very friendly and make you feel right at home. There have been very few hotels anywhere that I have actually sat down in the lobby and engaged in conversation. The room decor is very modern and the bathrooms are spacious with all the up-to-date amenities that you expect. Food is very good and there is a nice rooftop garden with a great view of the Lotus Temple at sunset. I stayed in two different rooms on front and back ends of a trip to Kathmandu and both visits were equally impressive. The staff were very flexible in accommodating my 3 and 4 o'clock early morning wakeups for the airport. Its location in a residential neighborhood is both a pro and a con -- great respite from the constant honking horns of Delhi's traffic, but also hard for drivers to find. Prices are very reasonable compared to the &quot;big name&quot; hotels in Delhi and you will get equal or better service. I would definitely stay here again."
7,1716,"Nov 25 2009 	A warm and welcoming refuge from the city...and a beautifully appointed hotel	The amber was an absolutely beautiful place for us to stay upon our arrival in Delhi. The hotel was exceptionally clean and well appointed. The beds were firm and the bedding was very tasteful, as was the furniture in the room. (Note: The showers are fantastic! Great water pressure.) Mukesh, the general manager, and his staff could not have been more welcoming. They made us feel right at home...even when we arrived at midnight! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Delhi. The only negative was that we couldn't stay longer!"
8,1716,"Nov 10 2009 	Amazing Customer Service!!!	I stayed at the Amber for only a 3 nights, but wished I would have stayed there much longer. The hotel was immaculate, very modern and very well appointed, but more than anything, the customer service was incredible. I forgot my hair brush and the staff actually went out for me and bought me one at 11pm at night. On two mornings, I also had to leave at 5:30am and they were able to accomodate me for breakfast and even sent me along with some Indian specialties for later in the day. The owner and managers are very good and highly responsive to any requests you might have. The only downside for me was lack of hot water on 2 of the days I was there, but I came to find that very hot water in India is rare even when staying at the best hotels. All in all, I loved this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone."
9,1716,"Nov 3 2009 	Saris and Parties with the Boss	After spending just over a week in the deepest sub-incontinent living in villages, traipsing through farms and battling 6-inch cobras, I needed a quiet and hassle free place to stay in Delhi as I caught up with friends, reviewed footage for a documentary I'm making, and chilled out. Indian hospitality is where the guest is king. This seems to be The Amber's motto.I arrived in Delhi via the domestic terminal...the Amber only offers transfers from the International terminal. They suggested the best way is to take advantage of the pre-paid taxi rank (approx 230 rupees to Sukhdev Vihar compared to over 1000 if the hotel arrange it for you). The rooms were very clean, but the windows don't open. The roof terrace is nice but there is no gym. The food was good...tho rather expensive for India/Delhi if you're into the 60 rupees for a chicken biryani schtick.Now...the service. I acquired some sari fabric on my shoot. I casually asked the people at the desk where I could get a top and a petticoat for it. They not only took me to a tailor at a local market to get measured up, but collected the gear and gave me an adhoc sari wrapping lesson. I was having lunch when the boss wandered over and introduced himself. By the conversation's end, I was his guest to one of his friends' pre-wedding parties. Everything I could've possibly wanted was catered for. The only issue I had was that no taxi driver or tuk tuk man knows where this place is. I'd suggest a little map printed on their calling card to help guests out.The boss said he's up against hotels like the Metropolitan. In terms of size and facilities, they can't compare. So where they have to excel is in service. The rooms are well-appointed, the rain showers are amazing. And its one of the few hotels in Delhi to have an environmental commitment to solar energy and reusing rainwater. Having stayed in many hotels around the world...mostly boutique ones...The Amber is, so far, the best. So if you can afford it and you don't really want the impersonal service you get with the bigger chains, come here. Stay."
10,1716,"Oct 30 2009 	Excellent clean hotel in quiet location with rooftop terrace and great staff	This was our second stay in Delhi within a fortnight and in comparison with Old Delhi where we first stayed the Amber was a breath of fresh air (literally)!. The hotel is situated in a quiet location which is mostly residential, so not really an area with lots of amenities on its doorstep, but with thousands of autorickshaws in Delhi this is not a problem. The hotel is immaculately clean, all white marble and over 3 floors with a fantastic roof top terrace with grass and rattan furniture, making it the ideal place to relax in the evening with a meal and view across of the city.The staff are all excellent. You receive an exceptionally warm welcome when you arrive and are all helpful throughout your stay. We were even allowed a late checkout to fit in around our flight times meaning that we could get the most out of our last day in India. The restaurant is situated on the ground floor near the lobby, so not the most relaxing of spaces however you can take meals on the roof which we would certainly recommend. The menu is varied with Indian, Chinese and Western food. The food is of very good quality, good sized portions and reasonably priced. The complimentary breakfast is adequate (but have to admit we did not get up very early so did not benefit from it as much as we perhaps could). The waiting staff are all excellent. What is particularly nice at this hotel is that the staff are happy to engage in conservation, something that we found is not so forthcoming in the larger hotels in India, this gave a much more personal feel to the place.The room was very clean, nicely decorated and the beds were extremely comfortable. Whilst the rooms do have windows ours was frosted glass, so do not expect to get a view, but you do get natural light , and the roof terrace more than makes up for this. The bathroom was very good, nice large walk in shower and again all marble. Certainly clean.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a quieter and cleaner location in the city."
11,1716,Oct 27 2009 	Experience beyond expectations	Amber is located in the east side of Delhi in a quiet neighborhood that depicts the normal day to day life of India through its large window in each room. This is a medium rate boutique hotel where the rooms were at a standard of any high end European or American hotel. The room was clean and the interior was tastefully done where each furniture item was selected with thought and a theme in mind. The bathroom was exceptionally good. Rooms carried all state of the art equipments. I must comment specifically on the food from the Amber kitchen. It was better than all the locations we were recommended to eat during our one week stay in Delhi. We did try all locations and always ended up coming back to Amber to taste items from their menu. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We felt at home at Amber - a special home with room service :-) I would recommend this to anyone and I would definitely return.
12,1716,"Oct 19 2009 	Wonderful Experience	I recently spent 10 days at the Amber hotel and found it to be a pleasant surprise. I have been traveling to India for the last 14 years and have stayed at many hotels in Delhi and found the Amber to be up there with the best. The rooms are large, clean and elegant. The bathrooms were of the highest standard, with a wonderful shower to refresh your self at the end of a busy day. I stayed in room 301 and found the view delightful as an array of colourful saris wandering down road in the early mornings and evenings. The staff at the Amber are wonderful, they are warm and helpful. It was always a pleasure to arrive at breakfast to a friendly smile and efficient service. The food was amazing, because it is a boutique hotel they cook your meals from scratch and you do not get food that has been pre prepared. Sitting on the roof top and eating the delicious food was a nice touch as the Diwali fireworks went off around us. As for the location it was good for us. It got us out of the chaos of the busy Delhi streets. Close by there are some great restaurants if you feel like going out for your evening meal. It is very close to Nehru place and South Extension to do some shopping. I would recommend that you have clear instructions as to how to get to the hotel so you can tell the taxi drivers. Once you know where you are it is not that hard to find. Ask the staff at reception and they will write it all down for you. The hotel has great Wi-Fi service that never failed. A few more little touches of India would not go astray. The staff are dressed to western formal for my liking, but this is the only negative thing I can think to say about this hotel. Looking forward to staying again in the near future."
13,1716,"Oct 14 2009 	Home from home	I stayed at the Amber again this time, which would be my 4th stay here. It is by far the best value 5 star hotel in Delhi. The staff are friendly and helpful and always remember you on your return. The room service has greatly improved and is now as good as anny hotel with a much wider menu. The best new addition is the sun terrace which is a great place to chill out. Will be staying here again next year!"
14,1716,"Oct 5 2009 	stylish and comfortable in Delhi	The room was excellent - very modern and well appointed. Great bathroom. Service is immaculate and very friendly. Its also in a relatively quiet location - which is very welcome in Delhi. This is obviously not in any way a heritage hotel, but for anyone new to India or just wanting a very comfortable and welcoming start to a trip, its a great stay."
15,1716,"Sep 14 2009 	STAYED AT THE AMBER AGAIN	I stayed at the Amber Hotel again on my trip to Delhi and this hotel is the really really good. The people working there remembered me and were warm as ever. The hotel is extremely clean and I would reccommend it to any traveller looking for 5 star accomadation at a affordable price. Food, service and accomadation is top notch. Check out their website for an accurate description. Stay at Amber and you can thank me later."
16,1716,"Sep 9 2009 	Refreshing new take on a business hotel.	I stayed at The Amber from 20 August 2009 to the 26th. I arrived at 2:30 AM at the Delhi airport yet I had a driver from The Amber awaiting my arrival. Multiple hotel staff enthusiastically greeted me despite the late time. My room was immaculate and very comfortable. I particularly liked the bathroom, which was huge and stylish (massive rainfall shower head, bowl sink, liberal use of marble). My bed was comfortable and the room was quiet (the hotel is not located on one Delhi's manic roads, but in a more quieter neighborhood that is around the corner from the chaos). I thought the room service and staff was overly generous and the staff were very helpful in helping me plan my time in Delhi. I used their helpful laundry service, which had quick turnover. I would stay here again and I highly recommend this place. This hidden gem is a great value!"
17,1716,"Sep 4 2009 	Fisrt class service - excellent hotel.	We stayed at the Amber for our first few nights in Delhi. The rooms were even better than those shown on the website. The staff were incredibly helpul and genuinely went out of their ways to ensure we had a happy and comfortable stay. The location is about a 15 minute taxi ride out of central Delhi at a cost of about 200rupees. It was actually refreshing to be away from the noise and hustle of Delhi in the evenings as the hotel is located in New Friends Colony which is itself home to many great restaurants and bars. The hotel staff were brilliant, rooms very clean and modern, great AC and showers. All in all a great base from which to explore Delhi."
18,1716,"Sep 4 2009 	I wish we wwere staying longer an excellent choice and hotel!!!	Deciding on where to stay as new travellers and in a new country/ hectic city was a difficult decision however, we are thrilled we chose The Amber. The staff are friendly and will always go the extra mile to help and advise. The hotel features beautiful interiors and makes you feel welcome from the moment you arrive at the front door and are greeted by Mukesh and his wonderful team.The rooms are beautiful, the showers are incredible and our overall stay has been a fantastic start to our trip. After reading several comments made by other guests, we were somewhat concerned over the hotels location however the staff go the extra mile to helping, with booking taxi's and even taking us themselves to the local town( which boasts wonderful resturants). This was perfect for 2 single females who have never travelled to India.  I would without hesitation recommend this hotel to anyone and would not be put off by the peaceful location. It is not far from the main attractions and is worth travelling that little bit further out to relax at the end of a hectic day.An excellent hotel overall!!!"
19,1716,Aug 17 2009 	Love It!! :)	Gorgeous and peaceful!! that too in the heart of Delhi.Great Service and very friendly- ever helpful staff!!The rooms are lovely and extreamly comfortable!MUST TRY FOR ALL!! :)
20,1716,Jul 19 2009 	A great hotel with very friendly service	A great modern and clean hotel (unusual in India as many hotels are quite dirty). In a quiet area of Delhi within access of amenites by short taxi journey. Staff are very friendly and willing to offer lots of help. Roomes are very modern with lovely bathroom facilities.Internet connection is free and is high speed which is great if you are a business traveller and the flat screen tv with English channels is great!
21,1716,"Jun 10 2009 	Great Hotel Not the typical and not for Delhi	Wonderful hotel. New and modern, thoughtfully designed and appointed. Excellent service; from the hotel front desk staff, reservations, restaurant, to car service. We stayed here twice over a month, each stay was great and consistent.ly excellent. The restaurant is exceptional and of good value, Indian to Continential, Italian and Chinese. Would stay here again and recommend to friends."
22,1716,"May 21 2009 	A safe haven in a chaotic city	Excellent hotel in south-east Delhi - located in a quiet residential area which made you really feel like you had escaped the chaos each evening (which is much needed believe me!)! The staff were unbelieveably friendly and helpful - ordering taxis, tours, restaurant bookings, train tickets.....you name, they would do it for you!! The security staff even helped us with a taxi-driver who had totally ripped us off...we managed to negotiate the price together after the drive back!! Quite a new hotel with beautifully furnished and clean rooms - fantastic room service and whilst breakfast menu was quite sparse, the food and service again was excellent!Would definitely recommended as a safe and peaceful base whilst exploring Delhi!"
23,1716,"May 21 2009 	Nice hotel but the location ...	Clean, well modernised hotel, helpful staff but, alas, miles from anywhere in fairly unsalubrious surroundings."
24,1716,"May 17 2009 	Brand hotel - lovely rooms	Brand new hotel with all the mod-cons of a big city hotel.Excellent service, but lacked ambience or atmosphere, i think there was only one other person staying at the time.Food was great, room was lovely and a welcome break from the budget accomodation we had been staying in up until now. The staff were extremely helpful and very accomodating.Would say that it was well off the beaten track and was a long drive from most things so not a good location if you are wanting to get out and see lots of sights."
25,1716,"Apr 23 2009 	Lovely small hotel in the upper end of Delhi hotels.	We stayed in three different hotels during our visits to Delhi and we liked The Amber. It's a small but very welcoming and friendly hotel in one of the quiter suburbs of south Delhi away from the hustle of CP.The breakfasts were good and included in the price of 125 per night per room. The staff were very helpful and the room was beautiful. The only issue was that none of the taxi drivers seemed to be able to find it, although to be fair, this was the case with a lot of hotels and sites in Delhi! It is out of the way, but close to The Lotus Temple and south Delhi restaurants."
26,1716,"Apr 19 2009 	Nice room terrible location	We stayed at the Amber on our last night in India before flying home.The location is a long way out from anywhere. We wanted to do some last minute shopping. Unfortunately this is in completely the wrong area, It is about half an hour if the roads are good! to get into the centre of New Dehli. We were also disappointed that the hotel did not have any alcohol as we would dearly have liked a drink after a very hot day sightseeing. On the other hand the room itself was lovely. It was spacious and well presented. The breakfast was adequate but no more.All in all room great, location bad and quite expensive."
27,1716,"Apr 11 2009 	A great small hotel	We were passing thru Delhi so we just wanted a comfortable, clean hotel for one night. Our travel agent had offered two options but we did not care for either. After checking the hotels on Trip Advisor, we opted for this boutique hotel based on the reviews. We found it to be a very nice and contemporary with a great bathroom, comfortable bed and bedding and great staff."
28,1716,"Apr 8 2009 	A PLACE TO STAY IN DELHI	We stayed at this relatively new modern style hotel as part of a wonderful 17 day private tour organised by Mr V P Singh of the Indian based company 'Legends and Palaces '. The bedrooms and bathrooms were delightful and 5 star quality. The service is almost too attentive. Be careful with dinner as VAT &amp; Service is added to the bill. That said, the meals we had were good and tasty. Note, the lounge is part of the dining area and entrance hall. Despite these criticisms, the hotel is in a quiet, leafy sides street and is good value for money for Delhi."
29,1716,"Mar 13 2009 	Perfect hotel for stay in Delhi	After many hours of research on the web, especially on the Tripadvisor site, we decided to book our 2 night stay in Delhi at the Amber Hotel and we were not disappointed.The hotel was in a quite residential location as well as being close 15-20 minutes to shopping areas, the room was spacious, big window, large flat screen T.V , and white crispy bed sheets clean &amp; the bathroom with seprate thick glass shower area with rain shower on top , the staff well trained and friendly, and nothing was too much trouble. On arrival there was a welcome drink offered, however the receptionist take us to the room and informed about the facilities. We dined in the restaurants at the lobby level and found the food to be high standard and reasonably priced. All in all a fabulous stay and we will certainly be back."
30,1716,"Feb 21 2009 	Quality hotel	Good hotel, rooms are wonderful, great staff, BUT! breakfast is very average and basic, that needs to be addressed, also it has not got got a bar, and that was a BIG let down, and we were told we couldn't bring our own drinks down from our rooms. but the hotel itself is very clean, and we would go back,"
31,1716,"Feb 16 2009 	Wonderful-looking hotel great people	I stayed here for 3 nights with my 18-yr-old son and we really loved this hotel. We even extended our stay there a night. Delhi is a typical Indian big city - dirty, noisy, seemingly incomprehensible. The Amber provides an impeccably clean, beautiful, calm, quiet island in the storm. The staff could not have been more helpful. Breakfast was good too. It's definitely worth it to have the hotel send a driver to pick you up from the airport. Also FYI, there are two Amber hotels in Delhi and one of them is in a bad location so make sure you take down the info for the right one."
32,1716,"Feb 3 2009	Excellent hotel but overpriced	The Amber is off the beaten path and you would need your own transportation. An excellent, clean and very modern hotel run by a friendly staff who is eager to help. The price for a room is comparable to five star hotels in Delhi. The Amber provides a clean modern place in a nice neighborhood. I would get into a larger five star hotel that has the infrastructure for rental cars, tours and an enviornment to meet other tourists. The hotel does have access to rental cars but we got a car for less than half of what it would have cost us to get it through the Amber."
33,1716,"Jan 29 2009 	Great!	Room standard? Absolutely fantastic! It was so clean and beautiful. Client service? especially two people we spoke with were extremely professional and helpful: one lady at the reception and there was a man - i think he was the owner or manager - quite young, dressed really nice. The rest was just OK but those two! We were really impressed! But if I'm to complain... there were only two things that were a bit annoying but it's nothing especially that we're talking about India.First of all the room you can see with red blanket, stunning but we I had a look through the window... there is an eating area behind! And it would be ok because they are serving breakfasts only but in the morning it was a disaster. It was so noisy. The hotel staff was preparing this room for a breakfast from 5am. Talking, laughing and all the noises from the kitchen. We were really pissed off when we woke up at 5am and couldn't fall asleep especially that we arrived to the hotel in the middle of the night after a few 'interesting' experiences at the airport. Yes we were exhausted and planned to get up at 7am. Luckily there was no problem to change the room so the rest of our stay was great.2. Another thing: tipping. It was driving us bananas especially when ordered the food and a couple of beers. The guys was puffing pretending how tired he is because he had to get the food and especially beer from far away. Yeah right! He didn't do this himself! and than said he has no change so you don't have to tip him when you order your food. We already did ;) Oh and don't order any beer - it is too expensive and can't cool it down in the fridge anyway.So the above was the worst we experienced. Not too bad hey. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."
34,1716,"Jan 21 2009 	Nice hotel; terrible location; unhelpful staff	Amber is a very modern and brand new hotel with all of the luxurious touches of a 5 star hotel. The hotel is very clean, the rooms are average sized, and the ultra-modern bathroom is a very pleasant surprise. The evening manager was extremely helpful with our check-in, and put an effort to accommodate our requests.On the other hand, the morning reception staff had a huge attitude problem, and seem to have difficulty communicating with each other. They did not help with travel arrangements, and ended up directing us to one of the scariest bus stations in Delhi. (We ended up going to the Intercontinental hotel to get help with travel.)The location of this hotel also makes it awkward for pretty much everything. Sukhdev Vihar is also not the best part of town. We arrived rather late in the evening, and driving through the residential part of a sketchy neighborhood was not terribly comforting. We stayed in room 102 and the view onto the unfinished road outside was less than appealing.For the high cost of this hotel, we would have preferred to stay closer to Connaught Place."
35,1716,"Jan 19 2009 	Excellent boutique hotel in Delhi	stayed in Amber hotel with a friend of mine for three nights.what i love first about the hotel is the very friendly staff and the General Manager himself ,very helpful , always smiling and wiiling to help you anytime(they gave me a late check out till 4:00 pm).the lobby is beautifullly decorated ,with free internet in the rooms/lobby.the location is in a quite neighbourhood ,all major attractions are within 15 minutes drive distance.the rooms are clean and comfortable,with italian fitting in bathroom and rain showewith hot and cold water.Room service is quick and food is good and hotel seems to be well executed in all fields.i love the buffet breakfast and fresh fruits as well."
36,1716,"Jan 19 2009 	Excellent hotel in Delhi	One of my favourite boutique hotels in Delhi. If you fancy a splurge get one of their rooms, It feels like you are in English country house.Great room design and bathrooms in a beautiful townhouse. Good service too. Please note it is not a huge 5 star hotel so if that is what you are used to it may offer you the similar facilities. It is a new building with white floors and lots of character- and big on luxury.The location is great in a quite neighbourhood Make sure to sleep you quiter in this Hotel.all the serices are great,like room resvice,taxi service,laundry service and restaurant and of course all the staff is friendly as they are eager to serve you all the time."
37,1716,"Jan 18 2009 	Way beyond my expectations!	My stay at the Amber was perfect! The hotel is modern, elegant, and cozy. Showers were delicious (had a hard time finding those during my travelings!), rooms extremely clean, and the staff was very friendly and helpful with everything.Definitely the best hotel i stayed during my month long stay in India. Paid higher rates in other hotels and got much less for my money. Really recomend it!And if you get tired of the intense Indian spices, there are tons of western food options."
38,1716,"Jan 15 2009 	It was nice to be pampered	Found this hotel on Trip Advisor. All that was said in the reviews are true. Moreover one must emphasize that the reviews do not speak enough good about this place. The staff is fabulous, always eager to help and friendly I needed an Indian SIM card for my cell phone. The duty manager sent his assistant on foot at 9 pm to escort us with the necessary documents to get a card.To me that was beyond the call of duty and that says it all.The kitchen is open 24 hours and the service and fare is superb. The whole place is decorated with marble floors , the bedrooms have wooden floors and is spotlessly clean including the linen.I have one small negative comment, and that is about the device that maintains water pressure which constantly pounds every several seconds , and heard mostly on the third floor.I mentioned it to the duty manager the next day and he said that he could have shut it off at night had I called the desk before I went to sleep.I would not hesitate to stay here again."
39,1716,"Jan 5 2009 	Overrated	Normally I swear by TripAdvisor and so booked this hotel based on all the excellent reviews. This was the last stop on our holiday to India and we were looking forward to staying in a hotel that appeared flawless! All other hotels we had stayed in on our trip had been super - and most of these recommended on this website. So, it was something of an anti-climax to arrive at the Amber at midnight after a 4 hour train journey to be met by a surly receptionist and what can only be decribed as a very average 2-night stay. To be fair there had been some early warning signs. I had tried to arrange a pick-up from the rail station a couple of weeks before we left for India, but their email address was consistently out of order (bizarre given this was the holiday period). I then phoned them to arrange a pick up but they had ran out of cars and were not able to assist in arranging a taxi. We managed to sort this out ourselves at the station without much bother. The room was certainly clean and very modern and with a great flat-screen TV. We had a Premium room which was quite small and the bathroom - albeit clean with lots of new fittings and hot water - was quite poky with nowhere to hang towels or put toiletries. It is certainly in a very quiet area (a good 30 mins from the center), but I think our room was above the water pump, which clanked loudly all night. Above all we found the service quite impersonal, and the breakfast was poor - there was no buffet and we ordered off the menu - the food was mediocre with instant coffee inspite of a state-of-the-art coffee maker that was used to froth the milk! This would have all been fine but the whole atmosphere was quite bizarre and a bit like eating in a hospital waiting room. When we came down to breakfast at 8am I thought we were in the wrong place as all the lights were off! They were quite helpful in ordering us taxis for day trips but very inflexible at the end of our stay, when we asked to keep the room an extra few hours after check-out time to wait for our flight, and we were asked to pay a full days rate with only 10% discount. We declined and ended up in a rather nice bar in town - given there is really nowhere to 'hang-out' in the hotel. All in all, the hotel was perfectly fine, but I think it would take more than a flat screen TV, and some chrome and marble fittings for me to give it such a high rating. We stayed in Delhi at Shanti Home earlier in our trip - and thats certainly where I would go back to again."
40,1716,"Dec 7 2008 	Home from Home	My family and I stayed at The Amber in October 2008. We had 1 Premium Room and 1 Executive Room. We did look at the other big hotels in New Deli, but decided to go with this smaller and very modern looking hotel and we were not disappointed with our choice. Both rooms were beautifully furnished with a very contemporary feel. The rooms looked exactly like the photos on the website and were very clean. Breakfast was very good and different every day. The staff were very friendly and could not do enough for you, nothing was too much trouble for them. We felt because the hotel was small, the service and attention to detail was of a very high standard. The location was good and pretty central. Although the hotel itself was in a residential area, it was only 15 minutes walk away from many shops and restaurants. It was also helpful that the hotel had a driver and a car available for day trips. This hotel was definitely a really good find. I'm sure next time we are in Delhi we will definitely be staying there again."
41,1716,Nov 12 2008 	Very nice stay	This is indeed a hotel that deserves its ranking. I booked this hotel because of its nice reviews here on tripadvisor and I agree with all the positive remarks already posted. Very nice and helpful staff. Large modern cleam rooms. Nice little restaurant. What more can you ask.
42,1716,"Nov 11 2008 	Great boutique hotel	We booked the Amber because of the reviews on here and we were not disapointed. We stayed on four different occasions during a month long trip to india and each time we went back it was at least as good as the last time.We stayed in the premium rooms which are slightly larger and offer free internet that works, multi channel big flat screen TV , coffeemaker in the room, mini bar etc etc - in fact every bit as good a room as the Taj Palace where we also stayed and just as clean. We stayed in 101 and 201.Meals are taken in the hotel lobby which is quite small but we also ate in our room several times. There is a 24 hour room service with basic things like club sandwiches and pizzas as well as some limited indian food that is very good but the hotel also sends out for food from three chosen restaurants - an Indian, a Chinese and an Italian - we chose the Indian and the food delivered in about 40 minutes was outstandingly good - way superior to the indian restaurant in the Taj Palace for example.Its also very inexpensive by western standards. We had no Delhi Belly problems whatsoever. Note they have no license for alcohol but will send out for beer and other drinks for you. Try Kingfisher beer in very big bottles for very small money - it goes great with a curry.The service is first class - from the smiling saluting security guard to the boys that take your cases. We left one suitcase and some packages with the hotel between visits with no problems and at no charge. We also used their very cheap and first class laundry service leaving clothes to be done between visits. Hard to criticise. Its in a quiet area quite a way from the airport and they could do a bit more with the roof terrace that would make a nice little sitting out area [ there is nowhere else to sit outside] but all in all this is an absolute gem."
43,1716,"Oct 27 2008	Excellent hotel!	If you are afraid about cleanness, don't worry...it's very clean and comfortable. Besides, it's a new hotel so, everything is modern. The location is great. It's not a commercial centre. It's a residential zone, so it's calm.The services are also great. Very nice for business travelers and tourists."
44,1716,"Oct 24 2008 	Nice Place to Stay in a Quieter part of Delhi	The Amber was a pleasant surprise in a seemingly safe area of Delhi. Not much in the immediate vicinity of the hotel but to be honest, the food in the hotel was great so we didn't need to venture out too far.The room (I had a Premium Room) which was extremely spacious was worth the small amount extra. The bathroom was massive and water was always hot which is not common in Delhi.Breakfast was basic but to be honest, substantial enough in the heat and before facing another day in Delhi.The only one thing that I thought could have been improved on was the quality of the drivers that the hotel called on as a taxi service. Many of them were quite rude and when we went sightseeing, they took us to where they thought we wanted to go rather than where we asked to go which was quite frustrating as we only had very limied time being there on business. I know this is not the hotels fault but it would be great if they used drivers that were friendly and more obliging.All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would stay there again."
45,1716,"Sep 8 2008 	Best New Boutique Hotel in Delhi	My fiance and I stayed recently at The Amber Hotel and we were very happy with this hotel. In fact this is the first review we've ever posted on TripAdvisor, because it's such a little gem of a hotel - we wouldn't be surprised if it overtakes the others in the rankings.We were looking for a middle-range luxury boutique hotel in Delhi - and if you've searched the net as much as we have you know there's probably less than 5 hotels in that category in Delhi.Delhi hotels seem to be 2 extremes: either extremely grand and expensive (aka The Imperial) or &quot;3-Star&quot; hotels - if you've stayed at a 3-star in Delhi, you know what to expect (basic facilities, a little outdated, not very modern, and a bit overpriced - so not always matching 3-4 star standards). So for a few extra dollars $150/night, we stayed at this very modern, quiet and up-and-coming hotel. We booked the Amber directly and we got complimentary breakfast included (nice assortment of pastries, toast, fruit etc....) - they also have a restaurant and breakfast buffet downstairs (nicely arranged next to an indoor water fountain). We were surprised by how modern the hotel is - didn't realised it's only less than 1 year old so everything looks new (furniture, bed linen, floors, pictures...). The room facilities were very good. They have the typical toiletries (complimentary shampoo - which incidentally is the same brand they use at The Imperial and that hotel is in the $300-$400 range!) But here's something we didn't get at The Imperial - a Hair Comb! We thought it was nice touch to get a personalised Comb that says &quot;The Amber&quot; (so we kept it). You also get very good towels, hairdryer, room slippers, shoe shine (we kept that too), tea/coffee facilities (though they could do with a few more chocolates in the fridge) and a very nice Plasma Cable TV.The service was very good and very personable. Because it's a smaller hotel you do interact with the same staff a lot more so it's not a different face every night serving you room-service or different person behind reception. They arranged some 'emergency' transportation for us (our planned driver had an unplanned accident) and suggested some restaurants nearby to eat out - so they were very helpful.In terms of negatives, it's a struggle to fnd some because they were honestly very good .... but if we had to say some... maybe 1 or 2 instances when we had to repeat a few things to clarify some things we were saying in english but it's trivial really.... the room service menu is huge but don't get too excited over the Pizza, the kitchen might not be prepared to make it - so please try their local dishes, they're very good."
46,1716,"Aug 26 2008 	An oasis of calm and stylish luxury in Delhi - AND it's affordable!	What a top-notch boutique hotel. This property is so well-executed that you'd seriously think that you were in Barcelona or Miami Beach. The rooms are comfortable and feature satellite television, the food is good, the bathrooms are immaculate - what else could you ask for in Delhi?I was only there for 12 hours in transit before catching an early morning train to Agra. The hotel was even nice enough to book my train ticket for me and had it ready when I checked in, saving me the horrible agony of having to pick it up at will call at the train station. Anyone who's ever dealt with buying or picking up a ticket an Indian railway station knows what I mean. They did charge a small service for this, but it was very reasonable (maybe only 200-300 rupees).The best/worst thing about the hotel is the location. It's in a quiet residential neighborhood which was perfect for people like me who didn't really want to be in Delhi in the first place, but it may seem kind of isolated to independent travelers who prefer to explore things on their own. You'd likely need to use the hotel car and driver to get anywhere as I didn't really see many taxis or rickshaws around there, but I was there in the middle of the night so maybe I just missed them. There is a big hospital across the street so I'm assuming that you probably could get one there."
47,1716,"May 21 2008 	Excellent hotel!	I saw the one review of the Amber and went to the hotel website and booked a room. I was really nervous about it since the rates were so much lower than other hotels in New Delhi, but I decided to give it a shot. Wow, was I impressed! This hotel is gorgeous. We arrived late at night and there was a security guard at the front door which I appreciated. The front desk staff was adequate, but not overly friendly. But the room was gorgeous. The basic room is exactly as depicted on the webiste. ...gorgeous wood floors, a very comfortable bed, a nice modern bathroom, a great TV, and the list goes on. We were on the inside facing into the courtyard area so I heard zero street noise. My only advice is too book your own driver, as their driver service was about twice as much as the other quotes we got from other companies.We did not try the breakfast, but one morning there was a buffet which was included in the room rate. But the next morning there was no buffet and we ordered off the menu and it was included in the room rate as well.I would definitely stay here again."
48,1716,"Apr 23 2008 	Excellent Boutique Hotel	An excellent property of a converted Delhi mansion in the South of Delhi. AmbianceA modern glass and marble entrance to a front desk with a small seating area and adjoining dining tables. This was obviously the living room / dining room of the home. There is a smal courtyard that rises all the way thru the four floors of the hotel. LocationCentral location in Delhi about 20 minutes from the rail station and 40 from the airport with typical Delhi traffic. I am not sure whether the location might be a bit hard to find by a typical cab driver as the building is in a residential area. The RoomA modern European architecture with the mix of fine wood and glass finish. The room is well appointed with large closets, a LCD TV, mini-bar and many other amneties can be secured through the front desk. (i.e. DVD Players, etc). A great selection of channels as they are using the Tata premium satellite service a feature that not even The Imperial Hotel currently offers. This might sound a bit unimportant but when one is traveling thru India, most TV reception is restricted to a slate of 3 or 4 English speaking channels. The bed was firm and comfortable and bedding was of excellent quality. The pillows were plenty and quite comfortable. The restroom is well appointed with a glass encased rainfall shower and hot water was a plenty; ServiceExcellent response and attention as one should expect in India. The staff was very helpful and attentive and could easily communicate via Hindi or English. The only misstep was when it took a bit long for the room service to be cleared out.FoodI arrived very late in the evening and the kitchen was able to create a good replica of Penne Bolognese. The food come within 20 minutes after the kitchen captain came up to the room for the order. PriceA very good value at 6500-7500 Rupees. Similar 4/5 star hotels will be in the 9000-15000 Rupees. The food service was actually relatively inexpensive for this type of hotel in India. Usually I would spend 600-800 Rupees for a meal and my bill came under 300. Final Comments:Actually a bit hesitant in posting this review as this hotel almost qualifies as a hidden gem and jeopardize their availability for my next stay trip to Delhi. However, I was so favorably impressed from my usual stays at The Imperial, Taj or Ambassador, that they well deserve it."
49,1716,Dec 14 2008 	Hotel sympatique
1,1719,"Oct 31 2009 	Bad Area	Not that great location &amp; hotel, just hyped room without window and noisy as on the street."
2,1719,"Oct 9 2009 	Good hotel great location but very small rooms	We stayed at the Florence inn for 2 nights. One of the USP of the hotel is, its situated bang on Karol Baug a very busy shopping street. The room that we had was a 'Deluxe room' which according to the front desk is the 'Standard room' of the hotel. On getting inside the room what struck me was it was the smallest hotel room, I had ever visited. It was square room with the bed in the middle and only 1 person could walk at a time in the room. Also the room had no windows, which I felt was rather strange. The food at the restaurant was good but the restaurant staff were not so polite in their manners."
3,1719,"Sep 27 2009 	Exceeded our expectations	We booked our stay after reading the reviews in tripadvisor.com.The Hotel has a wonderful website which enabled us to book online on their online booking system and we got cheaper rates, we wanted to make sure that we get a confirmed reservation to avoid last minute surprises. Communicated by email regarding the Airport pickup before my arrival and all emails were replied to and the best part was I got the Hotel booking confirmation within 05 minutes of my booking with the online system. Driver met me at the airport as promised.This being our first trip to India. We were rather apprehensive about staying in a non 5 hotel, 10 min outside the centre of Delhi. However we took the risk and we were glad of doing so. Florence Inn was great, excellent value for money. The rooms were clean, the beds very comfortable, the service was courteous and friendly. The food at the lobby level restaurant was superb in fact it rates amongst the best meals we had on the whole trip. Florence Inn is close to the Metro which is safe and easy to use. We did do a bit of local shopping.Staff were super friendly, spoke good English, and room/bathroom were spacious and clean. Wi Fi internet was available on each floor. Over all the FLORENCE INN was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this hotel, to families as well as to single travelers or couples."
4,1719,"Sep 25 2009 	Highly Recommended !!!	Quiet location in the middle of everything in Delhi. Great staff and excellent management .We were a group of 23 people from different parts of world, came to attend a workshop in Delhi. We were quite lucky to find Florence Inn. Full credit goes to our ground staff from dehradun and Mr. Jaydeep the GM of the property for making our event a memorable one. Service, meals, cleanliness, and quality of rooms were impressive. The Conference rooms are spacious and well suited for a get together or a conference.It is a very professionally managed hotel, staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant is open round the clock, buffet breakfast is good and safe. The hotel is close to all basic necessities and the metro rail station, which is a great boon getting around Delhi."
5,1719,"Aug 12 2009 	Satisfactory place	I recently styaed at the Florence Inn for a total of 4 nights. On the whole I do not have any serious complaints or concerns about the place. By mistake i'd booked into Florence Hotel rather than Florence Inn. Judging by other reviews on this sight Florence Hotel does not appear to have as many favourable reviews as Florence Inn. However after a few emails they quickly changed the reservation at no expense or fuss.The hotel itself is conveniently located on a side street with the metro stop only a couple minutes walk away. There a a couple of decent restaurants just off the main drag (Punjab Corner and Suruchi which serves 3 types of regional thalis - Gujurati, Punjabi or Rajasthani). It felt safe around the areas.We were upgraded to a Premium Room at no extra cost for no apparent reason and the room was more than adequate in terms of size and cleanliness. The buffet breakfast was a choice of either spicy Indian or bland western fare which was nothing to write home about but served its purpose.My only gripe about the place is the extorinate prices they charge for their taxi service. For example for the taxi ride to the station they charged us 250rs. The journey back from the station we used the pre paid taxi which cost us 50rs. Luckily we used the pre paid service from the airport which came to 350rs as opposed to the 900rs or so they were charging.Overall all though the experience was pleasant enough and would probably recommend this place. Rooms are clean and a decent size but the atmosphere somewhat sterile."
6,1719,"Jun 16 2009 	Very Decent	The hotel was good overall, the rooms were very clean, I liked the fact that they had TV in English and in French, I was jetlagged so I watched a lot of TV.The Food was decent, I'm glad the breakfast was included, it made it easier for me.The only little glitch is the pick up from the airport; they didnt' tell me that the driver wil be waiting for me outside so I waited inside and I couldn't see anyone holding a banner with my name, and after I waited for a little while I ended buying a pre-paid taxi for a 250 rupees ( the hotel had charged me 900 Rs). and once I left the airport I saw the driver outside, so I got stuck with the pre-paid taxi ticket which the hotel didn't want to reduce it from the 900 Rs. ( I ended up using it 3 weeks later when I came back to Delhi for a day)."
7,1719,"Jun 13 2009 	If you want to be exploited stay here.	Positives:-Clean rooms and generally good standard overall for the hotel. Air Con works.Negatives:-Not 24hr hot waterFood is bland at bestManagement will try and exploite and extort money at every opportunity.We were charged over 1000 rupees just for a taxi from the airport to the hotel. We confirmed with the pre-paid taxi rank that this should cost no more than 350 rupees. When arguing with the manager about this, he had a stack of excuses longer than my arm ready for the offing. There after, service was offered at an absolute bare minimum to meet their standards. We booked tourist advice separately from the hotel, and was interogated on a daily basis what we were doing, who with, and how much it cost. Regardless of what we would say they could always do things faster/better/cheaper.Breakfast was bland and spicy - too hot even for my tastebuds, let alone my wifes. Whilst the hotel is located on a quiet side-road, the area itself is very busy, and even by Delhi standards not a particularly safe area for tourists after dark."
8,1719,Jun 8 2009 	Loved the Hotel	The best place to stay if you are in Delhi. Its not too expensive and the service is the best. You would really be very comfortable once you get in eventhough you are a foreign tourist. One more thing that I liked is that there is a restaurant inside the hotel and so you need not find out a place to eat or order into your room. you can collect as many as your friends and take them to this restaurant in this hotel and enjoy. The food is really hygenic. Try it out.
9,1719,"May 10 2009 	Peaceful haven	Peaceful and quiet position after the hustle of Delhi's streets. Welcoming staff and tidy, small but clean room."
10,1719,"May 4 2009	Great Value and great service	I stayed at the hotel at the beginning of April having pre-booked over the phone. The hotel is great value (I paid the equivalemt of approx 42) and is certainly a ruby amongst the dust of places in Delhi within this price range - see the reviews of a lot of other hotels within this range in Delhi and you'll see what I mean. The location is very handy, just meters from Ajmal Khan Road in Karol Bargh. It's especially useful if you're going there to do lots of shopping as the shops are literally on the doorstep but without being so close to be effected by noise. The metro station is also very close and just two stops from Connuaght Place (Rajiv Chowk).My parents went a week ahead of me and were very well looked after. My room had everything a good standard room should have including ac and fan, satellite TV, minibar. Good bathroom with the usual bathtub and shower combination. The management and team are extremely helpful and deal with any issues or problems very quickly. The food is good and room service is also available 24 hours. All areas and rooms are very clean as well as very well decorated and they seem to be constantly keeping an eye on this. It seems to have been recently modernised and very popular for large business meetings - this I guess helps to ensure the standard is kept high. They also have an PC for internet access in the reception as well as WIFI throughout the hotel but it's worth checking this is working before going if it's an important feature for you.I would definitely reccommend this hotel to anyone and I will be going back on my next trip."
11,1719,"Apr 19 2009 	Fantastic value for money	The Hotel Florence Inn was our first hotel that we stayed in during our trip around the Golden Triangle. As we were travelling in the budget range ,our expectations were not very high so we were more than delighted to find that the Florence Inn provided us with sparkling clean rooms and excellent service. The rooms had their own combination safe, cable TV and cheap, well stocked minibar. The in-house restaurant and room service meals were excellent value for money (about $4 Australia an for a big multi-serve vegetarian meal). The front desk staff were very helpful and polite."
12,1719,"Apr 17 2009	loved the castle	We have just returned from a week at the florence inn. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel. It was so hot and busy there. All the staff's were friendly and helpfull. initially I Tried to book with the hotel directly, but I found reservation manager was beat harsh and was not willing to give us a good rate. later on I booked through one of my family friend. As soon as we reached hotel I saw a lovely person standing with smiling face,(sudenhdu). He made my stay very happy by giving me a nice room. I found some thing very bad i.e Mr. Ashish loby manager was not at all good enough. He called us so many times in our room extn. asking about further trips to india. he was trying to organise our trips to india, where as I never asked him about. I met another manager Avtar in the front desk who was very sweet and nice person.I will definetely recomend this hotel for guest coming to Dellhi."
13,1719,"Mar 21 2009 	Clean Hotel Busy Surroundings	Since this was our first visit to India, we were really were not prepared for the culture shock. We were glad to be picked up by the hotel (however, at a ridiculously high price of Rs1000 which they later charged us). However, we did manage to escape all the sharks (scary looking taxi &amp; autodrivers, tour operators) waiting outside the airport ready to pounce on us. When we got to the hotel, we were greeted by two men at the reception: both not all that pleasant. We checked in and the room was actually quite nice. Had a nice ambience, yet felt a bit detached. The bathroom was nice, everything worked. Best thing was the SONY flat screen TV! We didn't want to go out of the room since we were still nauseous by the Delhi traffic and the poverty we saw outside, but then decided to get changed and went down to eat at the Hotel restaurant. The restaurant was an extremely tight 3.5m x 3.5m closed space. We were two women alone in the restaurant with four men (waiters) and I have never felt so uncomfortable and insecure in my life. We were constantly stared at. We got the food to be takeaway and locked ourselves in our rooms and stayed there the whole night. The next morning we were relieved to see another tourist in the restaurant and more so thereafter.Overall, the stay here was quite pleasant. The surrounding area was busy, a bit dirty, but the staff was pretty helpful. There's only one computer for Internet access which is at the reception. For downloading pics from our cameras, we went to the office and were pleasantly surprised to see the owner, Mr. Jaydeep Bhat there. He was most helpful and kind. Even got us tea while we transferred photos and patiently sat there with us, and talked for almost an hour!I would recommend this hotel for Delhi if you're looking for clean rooms at a good price.Due to complete lack of female staff, it can be a bit intimidating being surrounded by staring men. One tip: Always carry a business card of the hotel. It has a map of where the hotel is located. Most autowallahs don't know where it is and you will need to direct them here. You can obtain the card from the reception desk."
14,1719,"Jan 18 2009 	Comfortable and exceeding expectations	The Florence is a nice little hotel tucked away in Karol Bagh, and miles better than we had expected or hoped for, for the very reasonable price of INR 3000-3500 (the lower price is for standard; higher price for deluxe; we stayed in both over 2 nights).The location is very convenient for the metro - a 5 minute walk down a busy shopping street brings you to the hustle and bustle of the road where the metro station is, and then it's only 3 stops to Rajiv Chowk aka Connaught Place. There's an internet terminal in the lobby and wi-fi throughout the hotel, both at a charge of 30 rupees for 30 minutes.We expected very little from this hotel, and were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were clean, relatively well maintained (not shabby) and quiet. The main difference we could see between the standard room where we stayed the first night, and the deluxe room, was the slightly bigger size - but the size of the standard was fine. Our friends also stayed in a standard room and it seems some come with a wet room (fairly standard in India) while others with a bathroom (i.e. with a tub). All clean and comfy though and well equipped.We had dinner in the hotel on the first night and the food was fine, surprisingly not that greasy, and reasonably priced. Although they don't advertise it on the menu, beer is available (and because it wasn't printed anywhere, we even negotiated the price down!). Breakfast was simple and nice. Staff were polite and helpful.Would definitely recommend this hotel - it makes all the difference in a place like Delhi to have a quiet, safe place to come home to,"
15,1719,"Jan 10 2009 	Nice hotel	We stayed here twice during our trip around the Golden Traingle. The hotel was organised as part of our tour. Our first time we got a very standard room but the second time, it was a much nicer room. The hotel is clean and the staff are attentive. The minute you step out of your room when checking out there is someone to help you with your bags. A little hectic in the morning with everyone checking out at the same time. Breakfeast was not as good as the other hotels I stayed in India. The metro is close by but we did not use it."
16,1719,"Dec 31 2008 	Loved the Florence!	Loved our almost month long stay in Delhi at the Florence. Actually it became our home away from home. Stayed with my inlaws and my 3 year old son. The staff was absolutely phenomenal! They were so attentive to my son's needs and to our own - they gave my son balloons as he had commented on a guest's balloons. They even 'rescued' him from an elevator incident! Room service was quick, efficient; food was excellent. Truly appreciated our clean amazing room along with it's completely western style bathroom.Make sure if you can that you hire a driver for your stay, it will make your visit pleasurable and non-stressed as no one should drive the city streets of Delhi. And besides at around $2.00 a day, it's definately worth it! So don't worry how far everything is in Delhi, it's all relative. Actually I found that the hotel was very conveniently located - Karol Bagh which is excellent street shopping, and about 10 minutes away from Connaught Place.Thank you so very much to the staff there - again, they were exceptional! As a very well traveled Canadian, I will definately be staying there again and highly recommend this hotel."
17,1719,"Dec 9 2008 	GREAT PLACE --- clean/quality space friendly + trustworthy staff good price	I spent 7 months in India -- lived in Delhi and Bangalore for extended periods, and traveled throughout the country (i was a study abroad student, then did some volunteering). As a 21 year old female, safety and cleanliness were my top priority when I found myself booking hotels when I was alone. It is about time that I give this hotel a great review. Nothing comes cheap in Delhi, especially when it comes to finding a place to stay. I knew i wanted something safe, and clean -- and so I decided to avoid any accommodation in the Paharganj area (near railway station). Although the Florence Inn is not the most convenient place if you are hoping to explore South Delhi, it is not too far away from CP and Old Delhi, and isn't too bad in general if you are accustomed to a commute (or Delhi traffic). And compared to other nice places, it is a great deal! You won't find such quality for this price anywhere else in Delhi! (when you are traveling in other places in India outside big cities like Delhi or Mumbai, you will be able to find cheaper places). I stayed in this hotel a few times, both alone and with friends. Each time, I stayed in their cheapest room. The cheapest rooms, however, still felt like luxury. The basics -- Clean sheets, towels, soaps, etc. And also, marble bathrooms, plentiful counter space in the bathroom, TV with HBO + news channels, hot shower with good pressure. It is definitely a place that meets Western standards. The service and staff were great -- They are willing to help and answer questions and are very attentive. The staff carried my suitcases for me into my room ( i never felt uncomfortable around them). The staff at the front desk who speak very good English let me use the internet for free in the lobby and print things out (for a small price) on their office printer. Further, after i checked out, but wanted to do errands and go out, I was able to leave luggage safely in the lobby. They even let me leave some luggage for a couple of weeks in a storage room -- it was all there when i got back, in perfect condition. There is free breakfast every morning -- which has options for everyone. And the restaurant also serves lunch and dinner. They also have room service if you want to eat in the privacy of your room or get a quick snack (they have great iced coffee and parathas). Also, they have a reliable, quick laundry service. When my friends visited me and they arrived in India for the first time, I took them here. They appreciated the quality of the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel! To book - just call the front desk! Find number on their website. The place can be tricky to find -- The hotel can arrange to pick you up and take you right to the hotel. It is extremely close to the Karol Bagh Metro station and this is where you should be dropped off once you have figured out how to walk from station to the hotel. Also, to be safe, carry a hotel business card with you so you have their number on hand -- they can give directions to your driver, if necessary."
18,1719,"Oct 22 2008	Average hotel	The hotel accommodation was ok... decent enough for 2 people... but we're got worried about the noise, cause the rooms are not so noise proofed... we can hear people from the other room showering and their baby crying... my girlfriend jess was not able to sleep at all... breakfast was ok though... and we love the location... it's in the affordable shopping district..."
19,1719,"Oct 19 2008	Lovely quiet and clean hotel	We arrived late at night, 2 tired mums with three tired teen daughters, and were so relieved to find ourselves in this quiet little oasis. the rooms were spacious and spotless, the breakfast was delicious, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. we would highly recommend this hotel for other travellers."
20,1719,"Oct 7 2008 	Great Hotel	There were 6 of us at this hotel including two under 3's.We have stayed in Delhi previoulsy and therefore were aware of the Karol Bagh area. It can seem scary at night but the actual location of the hotel is safe and convenient - right next to the metro.The staff are all great, helpful but the hotels greatest asset is the cleaners - it is so clean which as a mother I was so thankful for as it saved any upset stomachs with the kids.My children had braekfast and dinner at the hotels and I have no complaints. Restaurant is small but pleasant.There is internet access and the water is never cold!"
21,1719,"May 26 2008 	Exceeded expectations	In looking for hotels in Delhi, an affordable hotel without scary reviews is hard to find. The Florence Inn was clean and affordable and ideal. I highly recommend this hotel. The staff was overall very helpful and nice. We changed our travel plans after we arrived to see Agra and Jaipur. They happily changed our days for free.If this is your first time in India, as one of the other reviews pointed out, the neighborhood at night appears quite scary. We arrived late at night. However, once you see the area in the day, you will realize it is not that bad (and right beside a fun market, especially on Monday). I never felt threatened in this area. If I ever return to Delhi, I plan on booking a room at the Florence Inn."
22,1719,"Apr 21 2008 	Not a great hotel	We arrived in Delhi at around 3am and after an arduous journey trying to find the hotel (the taxi driver didn't know it at all) we arrived at the Hotel Florence. We were not allowed to check in, but were despatched immediately to the sister hotel the Florence Inn, being told there was no room left at this hotel. Language barrier prevented us from complaining so we went along to the Florence Inn.The rooms aren't unclean but just wasn't very comfortable. We had a single sheet and a single blanket on a double bed, and the towels felt old. The staff were not very friendly or accommodating but did help us when asked. The breakfast was limited (we had toast) and the tablecloths were dirty. I didn't feel I could trust anything else to eat.I suppose all, in, for a budget hotel in this part of town, it was okay, but I would make sure next time that I was somewhere more central and a bit higher class - you have to remember that 4* in many parts of India are not the same as 4* in the UK."
23,1719,Feb 2 2008 	Clean and Comfortable	The Florence inn was a transit hotel for us. We missed our flight and didn't anticipate spending 3 nights there. It was clean and comfortable. The water was always hot. We stayed in twin rooms the service was prompt even when we locked ourselves out at 3am. Rooms are probably a little small but worth the money and there is free internet in the lobby. The view isn't too exciting but it's not very central to Dehli. There were markets close to the hotel and lots of good eateries. The small restaurant did both indian and western breakfast and was really convenient for quick snacks in the day but also had full lunch and dinner available. A good clean and comfortable stay. Probably a 3 star experience.
24,1719,"Dec 1 2007 	Good clean but v little natural light	There are two sister hotels, Florence inn and Hotel florence, both in Karol Bagh and apparently more or less the same. We stayed in Hotel Florence, which was very clean and a good hotel for our first few nights in Delhi. Room service and the restaurant were good and reasonably priced. Staff were friendly enough and we got a complimentary breakfast for booking through Desiya.com.Karol Bagh was an OK area, lots of sari shops and clothes nearby but little else. Also very little in the way of restaurants. Its closish to the metro though, which is definately the quickest, cheapest and most pleasant way of getting into the centre of town (Rs 8 each way plus a Rs10 rickshaw ride to from hotel to station).The only issue I had with the room was that the window faced into a shaft through which we got very little natural light, which made getting up difficult.Price was about Rs 2000 per night (or a little over that). Would reccommend for garunteed cleanliness."
25,1719,"Nov 20 2007 	Decent + close to the subway	Not being able to afford the five-stars, Delhi seemed a really hard place to find good value accommodation. After reading a couple of good reviews, we went with the Florence Inn and, all-in-all, were satisfied with that.Still, one would think that a deluxe room would come with at least one window, which it didnt, and the neighbourhood (Karol Bagh) is not especially trendy. However, we felt entirely safe in the surroundings, and the nearby shopping street is good for clothes and lots more.One main advantage with Florence Inn is its proximity to a station of the newly built and well functioning Delhi metro  its clean, cheap, rather comfortable and very practical (although not covering south Delhi).One complaint: upon departure we booked and paid (quite a lot) for an airport taxi ride. That taxi showed up more than 20 minutes late and turned out to be some junky private car with the managers buddy behind the wheel! He got us to the airport all right, but such a pathetic mini-rip-off meant we left Florence Inn with a bit of a bad aftertaste."
26,1719,Oct 18 2007 	Liked the hotel a lot - good value for money	The rooms are small but very clean and the ambience is good. Its a good value for money. I lived in delux room. The staff are very cooperative. The maintainence is good. The toilets are clean. The food is also tasty and hygenic.
27,1719,"Oct 10 2007 	Not a great start to India	I booked this hotel as it seemed to have good reviews on Tripadviser. Although it wasnt too bad, the rooms were comfortable and clean, we just didnt like the feel of the hotel.Everyone just seemed to hover around you, musty smells everywhere, Bad aircon, breakfast was interesting and in a room no larger than a standard bathroom. Location was safe, just typical India really. Very interesting area to walk around but probably not at nightDelhi isnt cheap, but I would reccomend spending more for your hotels here."
28,1719,"Oct 3 2007	Good hotel but scary location	We stayed here in September 2007 as part of a trekking expedition. we stayed here a few nights at the start and end of the trip. It's a good basic hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are comfy and adequate. The only bugbear was noisy aircon.Beware the beggars and the market outside the hotel. It's not dangerous but it's intimidating. It gave us a flavour of what street life is like in delhi.Recommend the Crossroads bar around the corner with good food, drink and ambience. It seems to be a magnet for ex pats and tourists. We watched India win the 20/20 cricket here and the atmosphere was electric.Overall no complaints. good straightforward accomodation."
29,1719,"Sep 26 2007 	Stay away	I booked a room through a travel agent for 2 nights for three of us. I was told we would either receive one double bed and one twin bed, or 3 twin beds. What we got was 2 twin beds and a mattress on the floor wedged in between the other 2 beds and dresser. The room was very run down and tiny. We had to climbed over each others beds to get to the bathroom. The air conditioning unit dripped all night long on one of the beds and it was musty and dirty. I've stayed in many low budget rooms in India before and this was the worst. The pictures I saw on the hotel website were not what our room looked like at all. And not that it mattered to us, but our room was on the 4th floor and the elevator only goes to the 3rd floor, so if walking upstairs is difficult, keep that in mind."
30,1719,"Sep 23 2007	A pleasant suprise	We stayed at Florence Inn for 2 nights in Sept 07 and were impressed by the nicely renovated character building. Although no view to speak of, the rooms were well-appointed compared to other indian hotels we tried. A/c, shower, TV, fridge all worked! Market and metro are nearby, however it is at the end of a lane so I wouldn't want to return alone after dark"
31,1719,"Sep 3 2007 	Good value hotel	We read about this hotel at India Mike and we tried it for 1 night at the end of our travel and we were very happy with the choice. The hotel is very clean and comfortable and the service is correct. Also the neighbourhood is much more exciting than Pahar Ganj. We have been in many hotels during our India travel and this one was one of the best. The price/quality relation is better than other Delhi hotels and I can't understand why travel guides don't recommend Karol Bagh, i.e. the neighboorhood where Florence Inn is situated. There are a lot of shops and restaurants, few tourists and a good atmosphere at night."

1,1724,"Love the Lobby	the hotel is gr8 after renovation, need to gear up for the service standards..............."
2,1724,"Very comfortable	I stayed in Lalit during my brief weekend trip to Delhi. I was positively surprised. Rooms were spacious and decorated with good taste, service was discreet and not too much. Suited well a Scandinavian traveller."
3,1724,"We had a great stay here...	Not a bad stay. Location is ok, not exactly in the middle of things, but it's fine. We had a room on the 22nd floor overlooking the city which was nice. Our only complaint is that the reservation wasn't ready when we got there and we had to wait for them to input in the computer again.Otherwise, the rooms were clean, the food service was excellent and we had a great view. The breakfast was good and had no real complaints."
4,1724,"Nov 23 2009	Terrible experience	I dont know where to start,it was a bad experience beginning with reservation till check out.I made reservation for two rooms and when I called they told me suite is 19000 per night.I said I would call later to confirm.Called 2 hours later and now they quote rate of 28,000 for same room.Asked that person to talk to manager and they agreed to give rate of 19000 per night.I gave them my credit card number and reservation was made.Then called them later to book another room they could not find my reservation adn had to rebook the room.This is terrible standard for 5 star reservations.Then food taste over there is terrible.We had a function and had 10 things on menu .Out of 10 prespeciifed things there were only 8 of them and all of them tasted terrible.Then come to check out process,the staff has such an attitude - even the person who comes and get your luggage.We conveyed all these things to hotel manager at the end.He made some concessions for our bad experiences.But overall it was terrible stay,there are many 5 star hotels in same area with much better service."
5,1724,"Nov 23 2009 	hotel is gorgeous but service lashit	I stayed here for four nights in November 2009, and am so disappointed that despite the facelift since last year, the service is still the same: slow, unfriendly and depressing. There is a real problem in this hotel with the staff and customer service compared to any other 5 star hotel. The Taj puts the Lalit to shame, mind you so would the travel lodge. Let's start with the pick up service at the airport. It was complimentary. Great. He nearly went without me though! Two names on the same board. Because it had been booked by the same tour company, the driver assumed that when the first person arrived, they could go without me.. It was the other lady who saved the day by asking the driver to wait behind for me, otherwise they would have gone. Thanks to this lady! Secondly, on check in. 45 minutes this process took. I had requested a &quot;quiet, non-smoking room&quot; and called that day to confirm this request. They didn't have it!! Eventually after much negotiation they had a room, but when I got there, it was facing the train station, and had no bath. So I called up, and they showed me two other rooms with another compromise: one was smoking, one was adjoining room. I went with the &quot;quiet adjoining&quot; - my god bad choice. The hotel might have been refurbished, but the soundproofing at this place is dire. The next door neighbours could be heard rustling their newspapers and stirring their coffee - no joke! It was awful. Also, they decided to start smoking in a non-smoking room as the smoke smell went right under the door and stank my room out. I called front desk to report this, but who knows if they done anything! Laundry service is late. My trousers were 1.5 hours late. Breakfast was nice but again bad service, I was made to sit down at a dirty table, no one cleaned it. Upon check out, they had preauthorised the charges to another guest's credit card, and no one asked me how was my stay. They dont have questionnaires in the room and its no wonder, they know about the hotel's problems I am sure they must get lots of complaints. PS rooms are nice but not functional. Trying to figure out the shower, the button is hidden behind the dial. I wont stay here on my next trip to India."
6,1724,"Nov 23 2009 	Pricey but Beautiful	I stayed in a new room at The Lalit and thought it was amazing. The service, food, salon, gym, pool, decor, etc. can only be considered five-star, but it definitely came at a high price."
7,1724,"Nov 15 2009 	Cordial comfort and convenience	The impressive entrance and reception area makes an immediate impact. There are several very comfortable seating areas where you can wait for people, or just watch the world go by. It is a busy hotel, and I suspect that quite a few business people use it as it is close to the business area of Delhi. We liked the position of the hotel ( it is about 10 minutes away from Connaught Place), and the larger than average rooms. We asked for a non-smoking room as close to the top of the hotel as possible, and we weren't disappointed with the fabulous view. The air conditioning worked well and was easy to control. The bed was extra king size, incredibly comfortable with a light duvet. I would have appreciated a sheet under the duvet - sometimes you don't want to sleep with a duvet, but you still need a light cover. Both the bed linen and towels were top quality. We had to ask for extra towels, and one light in the bathroom wasn't working, but it was sorted out pretty quickly once we called reception. The flat screen TV showed all the usual channels, including BBC 24. As I am not a breakfast person I really appreciated the tea making facilities in the room, and also the amount of (free) bottled water. The bathroom was spacious, with a huge walk in shower. Curiously, the bathroom was separated from the main room by a see through glass wall - but you could roll down the fitted blinds if you wanted some privacy. The restaurant on the ground floor is open 24 hours - and we were grateful to be able to order food and something to drink when we arrived at the hotel at 1.30 in the morning. I didn't like having to pay to use the internet in the business centre (if you had your own laptop the wifi was free). But I did like the fact that we were given a late check out and so could take our time before leaving for a late flight out. The pool area was good, hardly used it seemed to us (but we were there in the low season) and the changing room facilities were fine, although the ladies changing rooms could have been better stocked with shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. The service in the restaurant was a bit hit and miss - sometimes very quick, other times we had to wait for ages. Security at the entrance of the hotel was good - fast but thorough."
8,1724,"Nov 14 2009 	I would live here all the time if I could!	I stayed in the Lalit for a week in September, and am planning to go back there again for a couple of days next week. I travel to- and around- India a lot with my work, and the Lalit is by far the best hotel that i have stayed in in Delhi, and also in India (even better than the Taj Bengal, Hyatt etc). There were a few issues during my stay, but the hotel manager went out of his way to resolve these for me, going over and above what I would expect. The rooms are spacious, modern and a joy to work in, as was the gym. Ah! The gym, the pool and the spa.. I would be happy just living here, in fact. The gym has powerplates, all the latest equipment, a great view, and the staff are extremely helpful. food = great, and a wide selection for room service. Definitely go for the buffet breakfast if you can."
9,1724,"Nov 14 2009 	Excellent Hotel-Good location.Value for money.	We enjoyed our stay in the Hotel.Centre of Delhi,Cannaugt place ,was walking distance from Hotel.My daughter enjoyed the pool.The room was big with all modern amenities.The breakfast was lavish.All the staff we interacted with were very courteous.Overall an exceiient Hotel."
10,1724,"Nov 13 2009 	SNOTTY RECEPTION STAFF	The attitude displayed by the reception staff towards me was appalling. I had been looking forward to experiencing this hotel but because I choose not to have a credit card on my person (I have a debit card instead), the reception staff forced me to leave all my cash (Rs5000) with them as a deposit:: I felt quite insulted . In the rest of my travels in throughout India staying at other 5-star hotels, I never once experienced this problem again. The room was modern but the bathroom lighting didn't work. The food was adequate."
11,1724,"Nov 12 2009 	The Lalit 5 star.	Service was excellent, arrived at 1 :00 am and my credit card was refused but they still let me go to the room.The room was modern with really good fittings, superb bathroom.Reasonably well located, a short taxi or tuk tuk ride to Connaught Place and many other attractions. The restraunt for breakfast was great, the outside eating area was clen and welcoming if a bit noisy from road traffic.All in all a good quality 5 star hotel with attentive and helpful staff."
12,1724,"Nov 7 2009 	Lalit	Very Comfortable, big rooms, beautiful lights and entertainment...helpful friendly stuff. Everything was Excellent !"
13,1724,"Nov 4 2009 	NOT THE BEST - BE SURE TO REQUEST A NEW ROOM AND DONT EAT THE FOOD	I stayed at the Lalit in Oct 09. On arrival check in was quick and i was asked if i had stayed with them before. IF you are asked this question say YES otherwise the will give you one of the older rooms yet to be refurbished. I moved rooms as not only was it old, dated and noisy dues to the nearby train station and the constant train horns but the wireless internet is so slow you cannot even access email.The new rooms are very comfortable and modern and the wired internet is fine. Still noisy depending on what side of the hotel you are on. I ate in the hotel each night and mostly the food was fine. The Grill is expensive and service is VERY slow but the food was acceptable. The Chinese resturant is OK. The bistro in the lobby is expensive and the buffet curry's are nothing special. They do however carry a mild case of Salmonella which is an unpleasant way to finish a trip!Check your bill carefully. I booked a room with free internet and they tried to charge me twice. Also check the dates on cans from the mini bar. In both my rooms they were over a year out of date.Over all and acceptable hotel with good fitness facilities and good location. If you can get over the noise of the trains and don't get poisoned its fine."
14,1724,"Nov 2 2009 	Make sure you request a new room	I arrived with a colleague and we checked in together. Her room was amazing, modern, and clearly worth the 5 star rating. Mine was old fashioned, had a bathroom with old fittings and rust stains, and smelled of stale smoke (room 1512). When I asked to change room due to the smell they told me the hotel was fully booked and they would move me in the morning but in the meantime would arrange for my room to be aired. Nothing happens quickly in this hotel but 45 min later a man finally turned up to help. Eventually we agreed there was nothing that could make the room smell better so I was moved to a room which miraculously became available.Overall the hotel fixtures and fittings were nice but, while staff were keen to meet every need, it could take hours (and several reminders) for them to actually do anything. The breakfast and other food was ok but nothing special and on one day we sat for half an hour at a table where we'd had to clear dirty dishes to one end (there were no clean ones available) and did not manage to see a single waiter to ask for a coffee."
15,1724,Oct 31 2009 	Good 5-star hotel with a classy touch	Hotel must have been renovated recently. They kept some of the &quot;old&quot; features but at the same time put it up to international 5-star standards. Well done.
16,1724,"Oct 28 2009 	would not stay again...	We only had one night in the Lalit, and chose it because it was closer to the railway as we were travelling, by train, to Agra the next day. Our flight from Varanasi was delayed..so we did not arrive at the hotel until 7 30 pm. Our booked room was not ready...and we had to wait!!! The girl typed and typed and typed into her computer..no apologies no reason and so annoying!! When we finally made it to the room..the room was clean and fresh. There was a sign to request fresh fruit if required. As our next morning was to be really early..I thought...good idea. Tried to ring in house dining. Phone didn't work. Went down stairs and requested at the front desk. You guessed it...never arrived. We had a drink in the downstairs bar and ate in the restaurant. All fine, not exceptional and definitely zero warm and fuzzy customer service, and quite expensive. To be fair in one way, the Lalit were finalising what looked like a massive renoavation BUT their prices definitely do not reflect any leeway for that...so they need to be judged against the full price tarriff. Would not stay again. Would head back to the Taj"
17,1724,"Oct 26 2009 	Comfortable if somewhat characterless	The Lalit is extremely comfortable, well appointed and well run. The location is handy for Connaught Place. Our standard room was spacious, clean and comfortable. In fact, everything you would expect from an international class hotel.It suffers only for being a large international hotel, in feeling a little anonymous and impersonal, which is only a minor complaint.If you can secure a reasonable rate via one of the hotel web sites, this is a good place to stay. Watch out for early check-in charges, though."
18,1724,"Oct 21 2009 	The worst hotel that I have exeperienced in my 10 travelling years	As expatriates for years, we have travelled to many countries and lived in various hotels for business or leisure purposes. Here is a summary of our 3 days stayed at this hotel. Upon our arrival, we discovered that our confirmed reservation was not listed in the hotel. We understand sometimes things are not in pleasant way and thus be patience for the front office staff to check. Sadly, the staff took ages to check our booking and promised to come back to us after his investigation. To our utterly dismay and shock, the staff didn't check with the booking agent and thus created another havoc during our check out. We believe, an unprofessional behaviour indeed does not reflect positively on a 5 star rating hotel. Space is limited, and we can't continue with more words. You are more than welcome to contact us for more details."
19,1724,"Oct 16 2009	A diamond in the rough	The Lalit remains one of the most lavish hotels in which I have every stayed. Everything in the hotel is modern, stylish and sparkling clean. There is a small night club/bar inside the hotel as well as a restaurant. Make sure to try the breakfast buffet, it is awesome!"
20,1724,"Oct 3 2009 	Pretty Decent and a Good value	Lalit is within walking distance of Connaught Place. Very nice rooms, good staff. I liked the gym as very few people used it and it had new equipment. Coffee shop is OK, but breakfast buffet is not as grand as the Taj or Radisson, but still good. Make sure you grab the waiter's attention if you require coffee immediately. For some strange reason, they haven't figured out the caffeine needs of the Western traveler. I really liked their wired internet. High speed, secure and no hassle logging on. Would stay here again. Paid @ $140 a night."
