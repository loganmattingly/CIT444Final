55,733,Apr 19 2005	Good value for money...	We stayed at the Fairway Hotel in Kings Cross last weekend (15.4.-18.4.)... i can say it´s real value for money...+++ great location - st.pancras railway station nearby (our train from luton airport arrived there) - kings cross underground station 50m away... BurgerKing 20 m away... :-)++ clean room+ fair pricesCan´t say anything about breakfast - we always went to pret a manger... ;-)	
56,733,Apr 2 2005	Good value/location	I just returned from a student trip to Paris and London. We stayed at the Faiway Hotel/Yorkshire Palace for 3 nights. We arrived quite a few hours before check-in and they were kind enough to let all 21 of us store our luggage in one of the rooms until we returned. There was no lift so we all had to lug our suitcases up some very narrow stairs. The room my husband and I shared was small but not cramped. We had enough room to open up both of our suitcases. The bathroom was small. Only one person can fit in it. My main problem with the room (#24) was when we took a shower
57,733,Mar 24 2005	A great and inexpensive London place	The staff was extra friendly and helpful to the extent of providing a battery for a charger and allowing us to leave all 6 of our bags in the small office when we arrived early in the morning of the date of check-in. The location is wonderful--1/2 block to the tube or train station . Also

1,736,Sep 28 2009 	Regular Guests at this top value accommodation!	I'm writing this review on behalf of my parents as they are regular guests of the Franciscan Road properties of FlexiStay. The rooms are very clen and comfortable and the staff who manage the properties are excellent and only too happy to help with any additional needs you may have. There is a good stock of breakfast in the communal kitchens as well as a lovely dining area. The location is ideal for my parents' needs but would be the case for most as the apartments are about 5mins away from Tooting Broadway tube station which takes about 20-25mins into Central London on the Northern Line. Definitely a home away from home and highly recommended!
2,736,"Sep 5 2009 	A good accomodation	The apartment is situated in a side street, in a very quiet place. The rooms have a modern furnishing, simple and functional. The common kitchen for the guests is very copious!Negative notes: We stayed 3 nights and the personnel only passed in the room to keep off the garbage (no room cleaning, no sheets and towels change): if you want further services, you better ask them during the check-in. The cleanliness of the bathrooms left much to be desired (traces of prevous guests)Furthermore, the zone of the B&amp;B is quite far from the town centre and the tube is the only mean for rapid transit."
3,736,Jul 2 2009 	Outstanding service with amazing price!	I just wanted to say thank you to the manager on duty the night that I stayed (1st July 2009). He was very helpful and provided professional customer service. I orginally booked the room in Norbury but due to train problems I could not get there so he advised us to stay in an alternative one in tooting. The room was very lovely and clean and I was very happy about it. I will definitely stay in the same hotel again and recommend it to my friends.
4,736,"May 6 2009 	Decent accomodation with great kitchen benefits	The accommodation was very clean. Internet access was included and the speed was really very very good. Staff don't interfere at all. Flexistay apartment is someone's house and you get a room with mini kitchen and fridge. Cooking utensils are provided but were all worn-out. We stayed there for a week so it was a good deal as we could cook our own food and drink comfortably in the room. Overall great, nice and clean. They have free all-day breakfast service but food provided was not of good quality. Bread, eggs, and milk were low quality and we preferred buying our own stuff. But you get a fridge in your room which I really liked. The photos make it look big but its just a standard London zone 3 style squeezed double room. Honestly, difficult to breathe if staying for more than two nights. But they have a lovely spacious studio style room on ground floor where we stayed. It was brilliant! Another thing weird was that there was no bed sheet. They have a mattress cover but no sheet. They prefer to clean the room every second day and insist not to ask to get it cleaned everyday. The location of the property isn't so nice, so I won't recommend it as a holiday stay. This will suit someone who is looking to save cost and prefer to cook themselves but yet live in a decent clean room within budget. There are plenty of take aways, KFC, etc just outside the property. Flexistay advertise to have Sky channels etc but they have only basic channels and they made up a story about PIN number for Sky subscription not working. Also, staff showed no intention to get it fixed. The manager was not so responsive most of the times. They say that they will attend you within 5-10minutes which is generally 15-20mins. Overall, it was a good money saver and getting hot water 24x7 was another plus!"
5,736,Oct 1 2009 	Sufficienza stiracchiata
1,743,"Nov 25 2009 	2nd visit great location and value 2nd BR isn't fully enclosed	Booked a two-bedroom unit (#218) for sharing with a work colleague for a week in London. 1st BR is as expected but 2nd is not fully enclosed but rather part of the open plan dining and lounge area. Worked fine for us but be aware of it in case that wouldn't work for you. Bed in &quot;2nd&quot; was two twins pushed together... which did not stay together during the night. Had some wireless issues early in the week. This room faces Cromwell Road but street noise was not noticeable to me. Don't get the wrong impression - I think this is a great property, especially for the price. I have visited other similar properties in Kensington and Sloane Square and they are double the price for no better amenities. (Photos uploaded)"
2,743,"Nov 22 2009 	Excellent apartment-hotel but give breakfast a miss	Excellent apartment-hotel in great location - 200 yards from Gloucester Road tube. Very spacious room well fitted - full kitchen, TV, DVD player, CD player. Very comfortable bed and settee - beauitifully clean. Breakfast is worth missing. Poor selection, very limited fresh fruit and malfunctioning coffee machine. You'll get better value in the restaurants at Gloucester Road tube. Only drawback is the noise from traffic on Cromwell Road but it didn't keep us awake."
3,743,"Oct 26 2009 	This hotel's strongest points are its location and the ""eagerness to please"" attitude of its staff.	I stayed in this hotel twice in the month of October, 4 days each time. I wanted a serviced apartment with a full kitchen that I could use, so I never bothered to try their breakfast room. I got a room upgrade the first time, and this basement unit was very spacious. It had a separate kitchen with dining table for 6, a living room, powder room, and bedroom with bath. My room the second time around was adequate. Furnishings are good but I would have wanted a dishwasher in the kitchen. Rooms are not equipped with washer/dryers. There is a laundry room equipped with 3 washers and 3 dryers which guests can use for free. Problem is you have to queue to use this facility, and that can mean a long wait.  Location is great with everything nearby ie. tube, bus, supermarkets, restaurants, taxi stand. The entire hotel staff is wonderful. They go out of their way to please you."
4,743,"Oct 9 2009 	Great Hotel in and Excellent Location	We stayed at the Fraser Place Queens Gate for 1 week and will stay there again when we are next in London. The hotel staff were excellent , they were always happy to answer our questions and were extremely helpful in assisting use in getting our hotel to airport transfer company to get use to Heathrow in time for our flight home. Our room was excellent - large by London hotel standards with a mini kitchen which was really nice. Our room was quite (away from the street side) and each day the room was serviced while we were out and about. The only weak point of the hotel is their breakfast menu- food choices are limited, boring and the same each day. Save some money and eat elsewhere. The hotel's location , in Kensington, is great for sight seeing. Many prime areas of intrest to us was within walking distance. For more distant travel there is a tube station about a block away. Overall this is a great hotel at a great price."
5,743,"Oct 7 2009 	Home away from home - studio style	My boyfriend and I booked this hotel with the help of a travel agent. With so many choices out there we needed to narrow down our options. Other than a clean hotel in a nice/safe area that offered breakfast, our main criteria included a shower, air conditioning and an elevator. (After hauling luggage through the Tube an elevator is worth it.) After reading this site's reviews, browsing the photos and doing some other research I was convinced Fraser Place offered the best value for my wallet. Kensington is the perfect part of town to escape from the hustle and bustle of the touristy crowd. It is a really nice part of London. As a matter of fact, our cab driver thought he made a mistake because the hotel looks like any other apartment/townhouse on the street. You know you've made a good choice when the street is lined with a Porsche here, a Bentley there and a woman parking her Benz right out front.Compared to other UK/European hotels our room was quite large. And we opted for the studio rather than the 1 bedroom deluxe. The bed was suitable. I believe it was queen sized. I passed out every night from being up all day walking around and taking in the city. Our room on the fifth floor was right across from the elevator and it was surprisingly quiet. No noisy disturbances. It was a nice surprise to find a big balcony with a decent view. There was even a little table and two chairs where you could relax and have some morning coffee/tea.There is a small kitchenette equipped with a sink, mini fridge, utensils, tableware and pots and pans. The mini fridge was great ... especially since there was a WaitRose (a mini grocery store) around the corner. Yay for chilled beer!!The bathroom was big, as far as UK standards are concerned ... meaning two people could be in there at the same time. It had a large window, which I also liked. The shower was not ideal. Poor water pressure unfortunately. It was especially bothersome to get the water to stay warm and not super hot. The L'Occitane bath products were a nice touch though.Our package included breakfast, which was pretty standard, self-serve. Choice of cereals, doughnuts, croissants and jam, toast, yogurt and fresh fruit. The fruit was the best part: apples, oranges, pears and bananas. Coffee, hot chocolate, OJ and water were offered.The nearest Tube is Gloucester Road, which is a short walk from the hotel. There is a post office nearby as well, which is handy if you need to mail post cards. Also, check out the restaurant Byron for a really good burger on Kensington High Street just around the corner. Be aware though, don't plan on shopping for souvenirs in this area. Even though there are a few hotels scattered around this area, it is still very residential, which definitely adds to its appeal.Overall, good experience. Great, friendly service. Clean, comfortable room. I would stay here again on my next UK trip."
6,743,"Sep 23 2009 	!!!	We stayed at Fraser Place Queens Gate for six days/nights in late August. First, the good stuff: the neighborhood (the Kensington section of London) is beautiful and charming. The hotel is within walking distance of great shops, restaurants and Kensington Palace (which has beautiful gardens and walking paths). There are also at least two tube stops that are only a block or two away...very convenient! The building itself is attractive. We found the staff to be very friendly and responsive. We had a room with a loft, one bathroom, and a kitchenette. It wasn't the most ideal circumstances for the four of us at bedtime, as my husband had to share the uncomfortable sofa bed with my son and my daughter and I slept in the double bed in the loft. Everything in the room was pretty nice...the furniture, the view was okay (looked out over the main street in front of the hotel). The breakfast in the morning was included with the room charge and it was good. We ate in the breakfast room every morning. The maid service was good - they came every day and brought clean towels, etc. Another bonus: free laundry room in the basement. Unfortunately, only one dryer was working. But for free, who can complain?Okay, now the not-so-good: The main problem we had was the lack of air conditioning. We had been assured that the hotel had air conditioning, and it does, but our room was so hot!!! We asked the front desk twice to help us adjust the thermostat or fix the unit in our room, to no avail. The unit would run, but it only blew room temperature air....nothing I would call &quot;cold&quot;. Since it was August, it was pretty warm during the day and room would get very hot, especially the loft area. We finally gave up trying to get the air conditioner to work and we just opened all the windows at night to cool the room off. The problem with that was that the street noise was so bad, we had to close the windows so we could get some peace and quiet. Sleeping was not easy due to the heat or the noise. We had to pay for the WiFi service for our laptop, which was kind of ridiculous, in my opinion. I feel that free WiFi should be included in the price of the room. This place was not cheap, and I'm not sure it was worth the money, but overall it was pretty good. I just wish the air had worked better!"
7,743,"Sep 22 2009 	Good room poor breakfast terrible service	We booked with BA for 4 nights at the Fraser Place and got a really good deal. As soon as we arrived were told we'd been upgraded to Fraser Suites, just across the (very busy) street. The apartment was spacious with a fully equiped kitchen and reasonably confortable. Because there's no facilities at the Fraser Suites we had to go each morning across the street to have our breakfast, but to be honest, there was no point in doing so. It was by far the weakest breakfast we've ever had. Our first breakfast was on the Friday and by Monday, of the poor selection available in the first place, there was nothing left. I've never seen guests taking their own buns for breakfast, or their own, normal, milk but I have here. Another thing was the air conditioner. Between not working (we were offered heaters to solve the problem) and making loud noises at 6.00 am, it was not reliable. The service was appaling. We arranged for a late check-out only to discover we had been checked-out while away on a last sightseeing. Our luggage was still in the apartment but our key cards didn't work anymore. When explained the situation we were allowed in our apartment only to see there was an electrician in checking the plugs. Complete lack of communication between the different shifts left us just wanting to leave."
8,743,Sep 8 2009	Loved the room but shame about the traffic noise and breakfast	Great and well equipped double room - unfortunately we booked a twin and there was no possibility of a change. Spacious room and a good bathroom marred by traffic noise. Breakfast basic and breakfast room very busy with people waiting to find seats both mornings.
9,743,"Aug 10 2009 	Great Location - Recommended	This property does everything I need it to do for a week in London on business. Easy and quick access from LHR (via Piccadilly Line to Gloucester Road station). Easy access to amenities such as grocery, pharmacy and restaurants. Galley kitchen so I don't have to eat EVERY meal out. Friendly and helpful staff. Laundry facilities in basement can be tricky to get into because of demand but are free (and laundry powder is available at the front desk for GBP1 per load). Would also work for a leisure trip as it is on a main tube and bus line and in walking distance to Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Science Museum, Natural History Museum, and Harrods."
10,743,"Aug 7 2009 	Great location great hotel!!!	We stayed for 4 nights in the beggining of july, 2009. The underground (subway station) is one block from the hotel, the location is great and very pleasant.The hotel is very clean and the breakfast is really good.The service was great and the employees were very kind and polite. Tks to Vijy and the Fraser's team for our amazing stay."
11,743,"Aug 7 2009 	Lucky to have a VIP room!	We have stayed 7 days in Fraser Place. We have booked a one double-bedroom suite. Very Lucky, they gave us a VIP room at the end of the corridor of ground floor. The Suite is very large, I think much larger than normal one double-bedroom suite. The large space made us in a very good mood during our stay. The hotel is situated near South Kensington, very close to Gloucest tube. Around are quiet and good neighbourhoods. Rooms are good decorated. The Kitchen is enough to make a good meal. But internet is not free and the calculation of time sometimes are not correct. eg. We have bought 2hrs at first, but it quickly expired only after about 40 mins. But staff are very helpful. They give us another 1hrs free.Lastly, the rate is really a good bargain considering we got a VIP room."
12,743,"Jul 12 2009 	Excellent location; not up to expectations as presented on website	Good things about Fraser Place Queensgate:  The location of this property is ideal - near Hyde Park w/ easy access to Gloucester Tube stop, some top museums, shopping, restaurants, grocery, etc. Really couldn't have asked for better London location. The staff was very nice &amp; helpful. Laundry facilites were free for guests! They did provide daily room service (tidy up, change bed linens, replenish towels, etc.) which was nice. Not so good things:  Our biggest disappointment w/ this property is that it did not meet expectations based on description on their website [http://london-queensgate.frasershospitality.com]. The apartments are described as &quot;luxury&quot;, &quot;deluxe&quot;, &quot;among the finest luxury apartments London has to offer&quot;, etc. In our opinion, that was not the case. We had one of the 2-bedroom &quot;deluxe&quot; apartments. While the bedrooms were spacious, the furnishings were not &quot;luxury&quot;. The beds were not very comfortable &amp; the linens were more &quot;Motel 6&quot; quality. Neither bedroom had an alarm clock (as indicated on website). The apartment we had was oddly arranged on 2 floors (w/ steep steps) - the bedrooms were on the 2nd floor &amp; the bathroom was on the 1st floor - very inconvenient. We asked for an apartment w/ bedrooms &amp; bathroom on same floor but all the 2-bedrooms were taken (although the Manager did offer to move us when one became available.) The living room / kitchen area was fairly small but would have been adequate except for the &quot;kitchenette&quot;. Again, the furnishings were not &quot;luxury&quot; - the love seat was a hide-a-bed and not very comfortable. The &quot;kitchenette&quot; did not have a &quot;cooking top&quot; as advertised; our apartment had a 2-burner electric hotplate which took up all the counter space when in use. The kitchen &amp; shower faucets didn't work well. The kitchen faucet dripped; the shower had a very challenging temperature control - temp too hot &amp; almost impossible to adjust to cooler temp. Both kitchen &amp; shower had very low water pressure. Our toaster didn't work - was replaced/repaired promptly upon request. One really odd thing - we had to ask for toilet paper several times. Most places you stay keep extra rolls of toilet paper on hand. Fraser Place gave us 1 roll at a time - we actually ran out once &amp; had to use the &quot;public&quot; facilities on the basement level while we waited for housekeeping to bring us some more (which they did promptly upon request - 1 roll.)In summary... this is an expensive property that is described as &quot;luxury&quot;. While it ultimately met our needs, it is definitely not a &quot;luxury&quot; property. We'd categorize it more &quot;basic&quot;. Their website (and corresponding pricing) really makes it sound (and look) top notch which is misleading. We had looked at less expensive properties but decided to &quot;splurge&quot; on Fraser Place because we wanted a luxury experience to enjoy during our stay in London. I will say that when we expressed our dissatisfaction to the Manager, he did give us complimentary high-speed Internet and offer to move us to another apartment when one came available."
13,743,"Jul 5 2009 	Absolutely approved	I booked two nights at this hotel some six weeks in advance and got a pretty good deal through gtahotels.com, at least compared to the hotels standard price list. The day before arrival, I called the hotel to confirm the reservation and asked for a quiet room, for instance facing the backyard. This request was met very professionally by the friendly hotel receptionist, making a good first impression. On arrival, after the taxi driver had mixed up the addresses and dropped me at Queens Gate a few blocks away instead of Queens Gate Gardens, I was met by another friendly member of staff. I arrived 10 am in the morning and was told that check-in time was 4 pm but the room would probably be ready earlier, which it actually was when I returned 2:30 pm. Be aware, however, that hotel charges a 100 deposit, presenting it as just validating your credit card, but the deposit remains reserved on your credit card for several days. In my opinion, a deposit of that magnitude is completely unnecessary in a hotel without either minibar, pay-tv or room service.The first impression of the room was however very good. As I specifically asked for, I was assigned a quiet room facing the backyard. I had ordered a simple studio, but really the room seemed more like a junior suite with three rooms; a living room with a small kitchen, a bedroom and a large bathroom. The interior and cleaning was much better than I would expect from a standard London hotel room. To me, a fridge and a microwave in the hotel room represents a huge advantage as it makes it possible to prepare some simple meals on your own as well as storing some cool bottles. Although the plumbing in the oversized bathroom seemed a little dubious, I experienced no problems getting a nice and warm shower in the morning. The queen sized and perfectly soft bed provided grounds for a good nights sleep, but constantly dripping taps in both bathroom and kitchen was somewhat disturbing, forcing me to use earplugs.I didnt test out the breakfast that was included as I prefer a full English breakfast rather than a continental one, which was the only option this hotel offered. However, I would strongly recommend the less than 5 English breakfast at the local pub the Stanhope Arms, which was perfectly cooked and really good value. All in all, I spent two better-than-expected nights at this apartment hotel in London. Great location close to Gloucester Road tube station, clean appearance, huge bed and fairly good service makes this hotel one of the better accommodation options in central London. I would definitely recommend it to others, but the next time I visit London on my own, I would probably find a hotel with smaller rooms that serves English breakfast ;)"
14,743,"Jun 23 2009 	Not entirely happy but still a number of positives	Our experience here didn't quite match that of some other reviewers! We arrived around 2.30, to be told that our room wasn't ready, and since we were so early (2.30pm is early???) perhaps we would like to go for a walk until it was! Having spent 6 weeks travelling in Europe, and having experienced wonderful hospitality everywhere else, we were a bit taken aback by this. I have to say that the rest of our 6 night stay was similar. Even attempting to book an extra night met with a firm &quot;No!&quot; Thank goodness we encountered another staff member who was a lot more helpful. Our room faced onto Cromwell Road, so we found the shutters woefully inadequate in darkening the room at night. We attempted to block out the light with extra sheets, which wasn't very successful. Next time we would ask for a room in a different part of the hotel. Overall, we were still happy with the accommodation, as it was very central, quite comfortable, and the kitchen area was wonderful. In fact, if we stayed here again we wouldn't pay for breakfast, as neither of us really enjoyed it, but would prepare our own in the room. There are plenty of restaurants close by, as well a couple of very good supermarkets, and being so close to the Underground, the Museums, Harrods, Kensington Gardens, and more, is a great bonus."
15,743,"May 28 2009 	Great Location!!	My wife and I stayed at this Fraser Hotel for 4 nights, after a fantastic experience with the chain in Sydney. This hotel is a 5min walk from Gloucester Tube stop, which is on a direct line from Heathrow. The room was very clean and surprisingly quiet given close it is to Cromwell Road. The room had a small kitchen with plates, glasses, etc - even a corkscrew. A couple of small issues - the shower pressure and temperature varied wildly and took some getting used to and the internet connection is quite slow, but there are at least 2 internet cafes within 5 min walk. Overall for the location and cost, an excellent value. We would stay there again."
16,743,"May 7 2009 	excellent base for work visits to London	Stayed in studio apartment - great space (clean, bright, all round quality finish). Great location for work visits to London (a few stops from Westminster and centre). A great accommodation option for some workspace &amp; to avoid the claustrophobia of a hotel room on longer term visits. Quiet location and yet just around the corner from restaurants, Gloucester Rd tube (heathrow line) etc. Very professional front of house staff."
17,743,"May 5 2009 	Fantastic location and spacious room	I had booked a studio room (via expedia) but was upgraded on arrival to a one bedroom suite. It had a spacious living area with a small galleried bedroom above the small kitchenette. Room was on the ground floor but I didnt notice any traffic noise. The bathroom was a little dated but very clean so no problem. As mentioned by others, the location is fantastic, being very close to Gloucester Road tube station (Piccadilly, Circle and District lines), shops, bars and restaurants in an upmarket part of town.The staff were very helpful and friendly, printing off directions to Pasha restaurant nearby because I couldnt recall how far away it was (restaurant is highly recommended). I would definitely stay here again."
18,743,"May 4 2009 	Great hotel few Americans Great location	Just returned from London. Stayed at Fraser Place, Queens Gate Gardens for 8 nights.Very spacious room with kitchenette. Very helpful and responsive staff. If you face the street know that it is a busy 4 lane city road early till late. Ask for inner room to solve this. Excellent breakfast room and staff. Most guests are from UK, Europe and Asia.Lobby can be busy in AM so try to conduct your business with them later.Checked our bags the morning we were leaving and they were held in a locked room.Also know that the Underground stop is 1 1/2 block (Glouster) and on direct line from Heathrow. Get Oyster card and use this line. The High speed to Paddington is $36 each way and you still need a cab. From this side of London it's quicker and much cheaper to take the Underground from/to Heathrow.Bus stops by hotel and too many good resturants in walking distance to try in 8 days. French, Indian, Thai, Spanish, Italian , Pubs, and Euro.If you have stayed in UK/Western Europe before you'll be pleased with this hotel."
19,743,"May 4 2009 	Excellent hotel with kitchen facilities	Good welcome from friendly efficient staff. The room was better than I expected,quite large.Nice bathroom with shower. First place I've stayed that has a mini kitchen tucked away behind a screen. Very handy for families or singles. The place was modern and clean. The breakfast was Continental and more than adequate for us but it depends on what you're after.No problems encountered and I'd definitley stay again. Great location too being close to major museums and an easy walk to the tube."
20,743,"Apr 8 2009 	Great stay at Fraser Place Queens Gate.	We also booked this apt/hotel through British Airways since we were offered two free nights. Our seven night stay was great. As stated by other reviewers, the location is fantastic. I had concerns because I was traveling with a cast on my arm. It is so direct to travel to/from Heathrow Airport using the Underground to Gloucester Road station; I had no problems.The staff was excellent from the moment we arrived. We arrived at 9:00 am, too early to check in. They took our luggage and insisted we have a coffee and a bite to eat before we headed out for the day. Because we had the kitchen in our apartment, we did not have their breakfast; we opted for internet access instead. This was all prearranged with a quick phone call to the hotel booking agency. Our room was kept spotless.There are two grocery stores within minutes of the hotel. Although the kitchenette is small, you can prepare a simple meal with a bit of patience. We went to the Waitrose grocery store next to the Underground station for our supplies. We bought a cooked chicken, fresh beans, and potatoes, which we microwaved. Because Waitrose is such a fantastic grocery store, we could have cooked more than we did. Another time we would plan to eat in more. The only thing that we would have liked was a table to eat at. We turned the desk away from the wall and used it as our table.The staff was really good at recommending restaurants and taking care of any other concerns. We had difficulty understanding the shower taps. They had someone go up with us and show us what to do. We would definitely stay at Fraser Place again. Staying in an apt suits our way of traveling. We were so pleased with the staff we bought a big box of chocolates as a thank you. This was a first for us."
21,743,Mar 24 2009 	nice place in kensington	I stayed w/ Fraser Place as part of a deal with British Airways and loved it. It was right next to the tube station and was in a fancy part of town. The Albert and Victoria musuem and the musuem of natural history was also right around the area. I had no problems checking in or finding the hotel. Since I arrived at 9am and my room wasn't yet ready I recieved a free upgrade. Would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend.
22,743,"Feb 13 2009 	Perfect!	If you want the same level of service offered at the Ritz, then this isn't the place for you and it shouldn't be rated as such. If you want a clean hotel, with good sized rooms and a great location, then this place is perfect! We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Although, we're not high maintenance and didn't require much assistance anyway. The continental breakfast was just what we needed. The only complaint was the very loud radiator in the room, but I always travel with earplugs anyway so problem solved! It's location is perfect since it is just a few minutes walk from the Gloucester tube stop. It's close to pubs, restaurants and a Tesco Express. We never came across a reason NOT to stay here. I only wish I had pictures to be able to show the newly remodeled room and bathroom. It can be very difficult to pick a hotel when planning a trip to London so no need to look any further: book it!"
23,743,Feb 12 2009 	Good Stay	Great location. Nice accommodation for the prize paid. Nothing over fancy but customer service worked well. Great breakfast even if it was only continental and costed additional 9 per person. I have had to pay 25 for much worse breakfast before in London.
24,743,"Oct 6 2008 	Great location acceptable accomodation.	Got 2 nights here free with a British Airways deal and then stayed a 3rd night. Room was clean, bed comfortable. We did not use the kitchenette so can't comment on that. We did, however, try to use the laundry facilities (until the dryer started sparking) and ended up hanging wet laundry all around the room! The location was perfect for us. It is only a couple blocks from the Gloucester tube station. Breakfast was included and was decent for a continental breakfast. I would stay here again since the location was great and the room was clean.-"
25,743,"Aug 13 2008 	Give this Hotel a miss and stay somewhere else	My stay at this hotel [in truth they are serviced apartments] defies description it was so bad.It started at checkin. I was in a taxi approaching the hotel but found it difficult to find the entrance. I called the hotel on my mobile phone on approach only to be told that they were &quot;in the middle of an emergency&quot;, they couldn't help me with my luggage and not to park the cab at the entrance of the hotel as an ambulance was expected. Apparently one of the hotel porters was having &quot;chest pains&quot;. My cab driver joked that the porter must have heard that I was approaching with all my heavy luggage!I insisted that they send someone out to help me with my luggage and they did. Regardless of whatever &quot;emergency&quot; was occurring, it is still supposed to be a fully operational apartment hotel, they are charging top dollar to stay there, and the checking in of guests must proceed as normal. This checkin experience set the tone for my stay as it was one disaster after another. It's hard to believe that Frasers is in the business of serviced apartments on a global scale given what a sloppy show they are running. I had booked a quiet non smoking room at the back of the hotel. Despite this they put me at the front of the hotel and Cromwell Road is a very busy street. Also it was clear that the previous occupant of the room had been a heavy smoker as the room smelled of smoke. I asked for another room and they sent the manager up. He was rude and got me offside. He said that he was fully booked and there was nothing he could do. He implied that if I left the hotel they would still charge me 2 days penalty. I said this was totally unacceptable as I had not been given the room I asked for. I found this manager had no comprehension of customer service whatsoever.The deluxe studio was large in size and modern enough with wooden flooring in the kitchen area, a modern glass dining table, a small modern desk and a modern bed. The look was ruined by an extremely cheap looking carpet in the bedroom area. Note that the bathroom door would not shut fully as the builder had put a raised wooden lining between the carpet in the bedroom and the bathroom tiles which means the bathroom door could not shut. Again this reflects Frasers low standards that they allow this situation to continue. Also note that I later found the spoons provided in the studio's kitchen to be dirty. Also despite this hotel claiming to be 'luxury serviced apartments' my deluxe studio apartment did not have a washing machine or a dishwasher or an oven. Just a microwave and a cooktop. So guests thinking that they can do their own laundry in their room had better think again. There is however a share laundry in the basement of the property. As it was getting late I decided to stay put for the night after the manager said they would open up the hotel window to air the room. However later on when they tried to shut the window it broke completely to the extent that parts of the window fell off and the window would not shut again. In order to bridge the gap staff shoved sheets at the bottom so that the open air would not be exposed.The next morning despite my putting a 'do not disturb' sign on the door I was woken up by a housemaid knocking loudly on the door and yelling out housekeeping. That was the end of my sleep.I then tried to call up reception to see if they were moving me to another room but the phone was dead. I then tried to use the hotel wireless internet [you pay extra for it] and it didn't work. I went out to the hall and found out that the entire hotel's phone lines and internet were down and they did not know when it would be back up again. This meant that no guest in the hotel could even call reception and anyone needing to use the internet for work or emails didn't have it. I went down to reception. While I was waiting to be served another irate guest came down to complain that the internet and phone in his room were not working. He was astounded when he found out all the phones and internet in the hotel were down until further notice. At this point I decided to get out of this property immediately as I had had enough. The hotel ended up giving me the night complimentary as by this stage, even they could see that the level of service I had received was an absolute joke. Using my own mobile phone I checked out availability in the Radisson Vanderbilt next door and left the premises. I laugh when I see the description of Frasers Queens Gate on the hotel website as being &quot;some of the finest luxury accommodation London has to offer&quot;. In my opinion the hotel is, in truth, a 2 star property with appalling service. I would never stay at any Frasers property anywhere in the world again."
26,743,"Aug 9 2008 	It's ok but then again we are talking London	I stayed here for just a night whilst doing a theatre trip in London with a friend. When we arrived we found we had a double and not a twin room as booked, this took a while to sort with the reception staff and were finally allocated another room. The facilities are ok and the kitchenette is useful and our room was fairly comfortable. The only problem was the shower didn't work so it was baths only!The staff aren't the most helpful and I'm not sure that I would want to stay here for too long, but it's fine for a night or two (but not as a special treat). The best thing is the location, just a couple of minutes from Gloucester Road tube station. Also I would never pay full price, I got a cheap deal on expedia - otherwise it's never good value for money."
27,743,"Jul 30 2008 	not worth a 1 star rating	My family stayed at this &quot;luxury apartment hotel&quot; property for 7 nights. The location was great, but EVERYTHING else was not.The front desk was not helpful or knowledgable at all, and frequently gave attitude when questions were asked.Daily housekeeping consisted of exchanging wet towels for clean ones, with trash being taken out on a random basis. Absolutely nothing else.The kitchens were extremely limited and not the &quot;full kitchen&quot; advertised.The laundry facilities consisted of 3 washers and 2 broken dryers which were also used by housekeeping. After many guests complained over the course of the week, and no repairs being made, I asked to speak to the manager. There never seemed to be a manager on the property. The front desk called him at home and was told someone would be there to repair the dryers at some point the next day. I finally went to a launderette- a 10 minute walk away.The breakfast room was monitored by someone who did not speak english and did not replenish the buffet unless specifically asked. Also, she did not clear off the tables when guests were done so that new guests could sit down for their breakfasts.This property seemed to have no management at all, and little customer service.California,USA"
28,743,"Jul 22 2008 	Way below what you're led to expect	First of all, I wish I had read the previous review before we left on our trip. In fact, we were there at the same time, so we were both probably some of the people at the front desk complaining.Our problems started at check-in as well. We had booked a 2-bedroom &quot;luxury&quot; apartment, and what we were shown to was to two story closet. With a spiral staircase (like a loft staircase) that we could barely fit through and a drity carpet throughout. I explained to the staff that I couldn't walk up and down the stairs for 1-week and asked if we could be changed to the room we had booked, we were told that the next day that could be arranged. I don't like to complain, so we agreed. The next day, I was told by the people at the front that no single-story room was available for us for at least 3 more days, contrary to what I had been told the night before. I questioned this and was told that the 2-story room was very much in demand and someone else may be checking into the one-floor apartment I had requested later that day. I told them to let us have the one-floor and give someone else the &quot;in demand&quot; 2-story and was told no. So I complained (to put it mildly) and was finally given the one-floor, two-bedroom. Also, when I mentioned that I had checked the floor plans on the website and they were not what we were given, I was told that only the &quot;best&quot; floorplans are on the website to make the hotel look better. Yes, they said this. We were moved, into a spacious apartment but the stay only went downhill from there.They mention laundry facilities. What they fail to mention is that the dryers don't work properly and that, unless you feel like having damp clothing drying around the apartment for a couple of days (or using the laundrymat next to Sainsbury's down the street), you shouldn't use their equipment. It was fun the way all the people fought for use of the one working &quot;dryer&quot; and an electrician from Australia tried to fix it so he could finish his laundry.They do have a passable breakfast buffet, but you may have to clean your table before you sit down because the girl on duty is busy doing the administrative work in the prep area. Oh, it's also kind of fun to navigate around the food delivery boxes as you enter the resident's lounge.Don't ask for any help from the front desk (with the exception of Thomas). Either they have absolutely NO information of anything outside of a 1 block radius, or they roll theirs eyes at you and mutter under their breath when you walk into the front lobby. Either I've seen too many movies showing the English people as warm and welcoming folks, or Fraser Place just employs the snootiest people they can find. Just as an aside, we went to Paris after London, and were thrilled with the warm welcome we received by the French hotel employees.Oh, and don't expect your trash to be emptied every day, because it's not.The only good thing I can say is that the location is great.Not much else to add (actually there is, but it's just more of the same), so please be aware that the only reason you will want to stay here is the location."
29,743,"May 30 2008 	Its decent.	We (3 adults and 1 baby) stayed at the Fraser House for 4 nights in May 2008. By London standards the 1 bedroom deluxe apartment is large and pretty fairly priced for the size and location. We had an apartment on the fifth floor. Unfortunately all the windows were blocked by the edge of the roof, so we had absolutely no view. May have had a better view from a basement room! The lift is small and rattled, making me feel very clausterphobic and anxious that is was going to get stuck or drop. A few times I took the steps...113 to the 5th floor!! The apartment was nice. Modern, clean and relatively spacious. But there were some problems. The bedroom had a vent that rattled all day and all night. Because of the noise I had to sleep on the sofabed in the living room. Despite daily complaints to the front desk staff the noise was not remedied during our stay. The bathroom sink was clogged for the first 2 days and our phone also did not work for 2 days. There is no housekeeping or maintenance during the weekend, so if something needs to be cleaned or fixed you are out of luck. The kitchenette was great to have especially travelling with a baby. London prices are super expensive so stock up at the supermarkets. There is one virtually across the street and another one a few blocks away. The location of the hotel is excellent. Close to transportation, museums, pubs and restaurants."
30,743,"Apr 29 2008	Would definitely recommend	Stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in April and would definitely recommend.Great location (less than 2 minutes from Gloucter Road tube) and the biggest room I've ever been to in London. Staff were very helpful and friendly.Lifts were slow and sometimes out of service so if you mind that, ask for a lower floor."
31,743,"Feb 25 2008 	Acceptable Hotel	We only stayed here one night (with our young daughter) The best thing by far is the location. Its just a few minutes from the museums and tube station. The room was surprisingly large. It was certainly an 'apartment' with seperate bedroom; and our 8 year old was blown away by her bed being on a balcony above the lounge area! The main problem was the constant traffic noise. Our room (111) faced the main road, and the secondary double glazing was rubbish - we probably had around 3 hours sleep in total! Breakfast was average - a choice of 3 cereals, tea/coffee, toast &amp; jam, a fruit bowl and muffins / dougnuts (presumable for the americans?!) There appeared to be no option to 'upgrade' breakfast to a full english, and don't expect an evening meal here, as they don't do it! To be fare, you are svery close to a great choice of places to eat, so this is not really a problem. The staff were also average - pleasant enough, but a little more communication would have been nice. When confirming the reservation the day before, I asked if we could leave our luggage prior to the check-in time of 4pm. I was told it would be left somewhere 'secure'. When we returned from the museum to check in at 5pm, our bags had just been left next to the reception desk! - Not particually 'secure'. On check out, it would have been nice to have been asked if everything had been ok, but as we had nothing to pay, we were just told that the bill was 'clear'.Overall an OK experiance - would I stay again though? - Probably not."
32,743,"Feb 16 2008	Great place for a family to stay	We have just returned from a two night stay in Fraser Place. As a family of four including two teenagers we found the apartments to be very comfortable and clean. The location is superb. The tube station is literally around the corner and being on the Picadilly line you have a direct link to Heathrow Airport and to all city centre attractions.On a slight downside the heating system, air conditioning and dvd player did not work properly but we were too busy with all London has to offer to get it sorted out!!!Would definitely return here in the future."
33,743,"Jan 25 2008 	Great All-Around	Great location just blocks from Gloucester Road Tube Station in Kensington. Great price for a large room that fit 4 adults comfortably. Friendly and accomodating staff, clean room, kitchenette, comfortable bed, nice view, and quiet location. Sleep sofa not so comfortable."
34,743,"Jan 25 2008 	Great Hotel	Booked this hotel throught British Airways and was not disappointed. It was our first trip to London and we absolutely loved the hotel. We went for the Christmas holiday, had mom, dad an18 yr old and 20 yr old and we had plenty of room. The staff was outstanding. Took care of our every need and were very pleasant.The location was great. Close to tube, pubs, restaurants and a grocery store. A&amp;V museum and Natural HIstory museum both very close and must do's, plus Hyde Park. Left very early two mornings, once for Paris and once for Belgium. Took the tube right to Pancreas with time to spare. We would definately stay again."
35,743,"Jan 24 2008 	Good-- as long as you're never in the room	I am currently staying in Fraser Place for an extended corporate stay and I would highly discourage anyone from staying here for more than one week, or for using the room as anything more than a sleeping/showering location. Like previous reviewers noted, the kitchen is lacking any kind of actual cooking apparatus, so, other than sandwiches and cereal, we eat out for most of our meals. The service here is spotty; sometimes the front desk is helpful, but they frequently do not answer the phone or provide accurate help. Like a previous reviewer, I too have had plumbing problems, as well as the heating/air conditioning unit making extreme noises. Finally, the apartment is barely cleaned. When we arrived, there was a half-used shampoo bottle laid out for our use and the toilet looked like it could use a thorough cleaning. I have reached out to the management several times about the deficiencies of the room and have received some help at times, and no help at other times. If you are here with a family to tour London, and you plan on not being in the apartment much, I am sure this is a fine place for you to stay. But if you are looking for an extended stay apartment-type situation, keep on looking..."
36,743,"Nov 25 2007 	Not Bad for London	We took a chance on the Fraser Place Queen's Gate as we wanted a larger room (traveling with our two sons) and a price that was good for London. Overall, the hotel delivered for us.The room had recenly been renovated and everything was in good shape and clean. We had a bedroom, large bathroom and a combined living/kitchen area with a hide-a-bed. The bed in the bedroom was nice and large, but our boys were a little close in the other bed. Our room was quiet as we were away from Cromwell (and we were not in the basement). Heat worked okay and it did appear to have air conditioning (not an issue for us). We noticed some odd smells in the hall, but had no problem in our room.Service was &quot;okay&quot;. When checking in, it felt as if we were disturbing the clerk. She was also less than friendly when we had to call several times to request bedding for the fold-out bed. On the plus side, the cleaning was great and they were able to arrange a car to the airport (once someone finally picked up the phone). Price was lower than we could find elsewhere (booked via hotel website).Location was good as we were less than two blocks from the Natural History Museum and the Gloucester Tube stop. There were three grocery stores nearby, so we were able to make use of our kitchen and save money at breakfast. The South Kensington area seemed more touristy than other areas of the city we've stayed in, but it is convenient especially with the tube."
37,743,"Oct 12 2007 	Could be better	Stayed in early-mid September 2007Given a basement one bedroom 'apartment'.The first surprise was that there were actually rooms in the basement of a hotel..yes, basement. I thought hotels only kept things like the laundry and other noisy/ unsightly things there..and yes there was a laundry nearby. ( which to their credit was free).Besides the ignominy of being placed in the bowels of the hotel, there was still major construction/renovation of the hotel happening up to virtually right in front of our door ( dust /strewn plywood etc) and it certainly looked as if there was still many months left of it to go, thru ought the hotel. The breakfast was provided in a dining area, but just the bare minimum continental fare of coffee ( nice coffee maker) , supermarket/ gas station quality croissants / jam filled donuts / toast with some cereals/ OJ/ yogurt/basic fruit. No cold meats/cheeses or hot food stuffs were available. I stopped going there after the second day.The apartment itself seemed to have been recently renovated, but not very well maintained ( stains here and there, food crumbs on opening the sofa bed) The smell of new paint was fairly pungent and overpowering in an unpleasant way.The basic toiletries were pleasant enough on initial inspection (basic but LOccitane stuff) However on closer inspection the use-by date was well and truly past it for ALL of them ( we are talking 2006) and to add to the insult it was never replenished during our 5 day stay there! ( Couldnt be bothered to call room serviceJust went to Tescos)Have I talked too much about the negatives of that place? ( By the way, bed linen never changed during our stay there, hotplate/ kitchen not great for cooking..)Here are the positives.Not too far from the Gloucester Rd station ( ?150-200m walk) (a small Tescos / KFC/ McDonalds in front of station) Pleasant walk to Kensington Gardens / Hyde Park( Warning-I like walking). Virtually next to V&amp;A museum and Natural History Museum.etc.Most people will probably be able to find a better place for the price somewhere else. But we are talking about London here. May be a better place once all the construction is finished, if they dont use the basement as part of the hotel, improve the maid/room cleaning services and invest a bit more on the breakfast.Cheers to all."
38,743,"Oct 7 2007 	Convenient Location Good Staff	Fraser Place Queens Gate is in a great location for access to sightseeing -- one block from the Gloucester Road Tube station which services the Picadilly, District and Circle lines that access many points of interest directly. Get a day pass and ride the Tube (and buses) all day -- very, very easy even on your first day there. The aparthotel itself is relatively quiet; not a luxury accomodation by any stretch, but the apartments are decent, if a bit plain (they'd do well to get some decorations on the wall just to brighten things up a bit). I believe that Fraser Hospitality recently took over this property, so they are still in the process of renovation (a few back hallways had rolled up carpeting, etc. nothing obtrusive, though). We had a decent-sized one-bedroom apartment (G03) on the second floor up a private set of stairs. Definitely roomy by London standards. While there was no stove (only a single hotplate), there was a microwave, refrigerator and kitchenware which made it easier to save money by not eating out for every meal (London's not really known for their great cuisine anyway!) The bathroom was adequate to smallish in terms of size; however we had plumbing problems at the beginning and end of our trip. The beginning of the trip we had no hot water in the shower, but the hotel promptly sent up their maintenance guy to fix things. The morning we were leaving, we woke up to no water at all (including the toilet). The hotel allowed us to use another empty apartment's bathroom (G06 on the first floor - a large studio which had a HUGE bathroom and nice looking apartment) to shower, so, while inconvenient, the hotel promptly responded to our needs. Negatives:* Plumbing issues for our apartment, but all was remedied as quickly as they could.* Plain, mildly gloomy apartment (we looked out on a brick wall from both rooms).* No clock in the room (ask for one and they'll provide one for you, though).Positives:* Location, definitely. Easy to get around the city and feels safe. Plenty of places to eat and change money.* Staff is friendly, always accessible and very responsive.* More room than the average hotel in London, but similar pricing to mid-range hotels. Check their website for special prices.All in all, I think we'd stay there again despite the few issues we had. The staff is very nice and the location can't be beat for the price."
39,743,"Aug 4 2007 	Overall a great place to stay	Our family of four (including two teenage boys) stayed in a one bedroom super deluxe apartment at the end of July. We initially searched a ton of London hotels looking for a quadruple room, to no avail, so finally chose to go the apartment route and we are very glad we did! The apartment was clean and modern with a small kitchenette, sofa bed and table &amp; chairs in the living area. The pictures on the hotel website are accurate. The building is currently being refurbished on the outside; however our room was fully remodeled and surprisingly even had air conditioning. The air conditioning unit worked well initially but after awhile made odd sounds so we turned it off (it really wasnt necessary anyway due to the mild temperatures, we primarily used it so we didnt have to keep the windows open at night and hear the street traffic). The only negative experienced was that while a hairdryer was provided, it could not be used in the bathroom (which contained a shaver-only plug). Normally I wouldn't mind this, but considering there were no mirrors within range of a plug for the hairdryer it ended up being quite inconvenient! The housekeeping staff was kind enough to make the sofa bed more comfortable by providing an extra duvet to be used on top of the mattress. Breakfast was just fine, mostly pastries, donuts and fruit (try to get breakfast included in your room rate if possible). The location of the apartments is outstanding, a 5 minute walk from the Gloucester Road Tube station in a beautiful residential area of South Kensington. We either walked or took the tube everywhere! The front desk clerks were very friendly and helpful. Internet access is available for a small fee (unless you plan on being on the internet a lot, purchase only a small amount of hours as it is for cumulative usage over the period of time it is used rather than expiring in a set period of hours). Overall, I would recommend Fraser Place Queens Gate to families who need extra space and want to be near a tube stop in a very safe, pleasant area of London."
40,743,"Aug 3 2007 	3 star hotel equivalent	We stayed a week in a 2 bedroom(only 1 bathroom) for the price equivalent of a 5 star 1 bedroom hotel room. The property is 6 months into a renovation so the apartment decor was new &amp; clean although the corridors were still old &amp; not renovated yet. Security was not great with the reception permantly jarring open the security doors to allow unrestricted access to the property, the reception had no interest monitoring the coming &amp; goings, the apartments under renovation left the windows &amp; doors open overnight &amp; the building was 75% covered in scaffolding. The apartment was very nicely decorated , had great air con. &amp; heating but the kichenette wasn't well equipped with 2 small hobs &amp; a couple of small pans, Also there is no washing machine in the apartment itself.The reception was not very helpful &amp; you will have trouble getting help with luggage.We would stay again given the location near the tube &amp; museums but compared to a hotel for the same price the service/security is inferior &amp; not well equipped c.f other apartments.."
41,743,"Jul 21 2007 	Great location but not fully reburbished	A family of 4 (including a toddler and a teen) stayed in a 1 BR apartment here, with small kitchen facilities, modern furniture, comfortable bed. The location is great, close to museums, parks, shops and the tube. This property was recently sold and is still being refurbished (there was scaffolding and green mesh covering most of the hotel's exterior), though their website does not mention that and nor did the staff member I communicated with when booking. Our apartment was light, spatious, but suffered from various problemsthat were all relatively small but added up: the phone didn't work, akitchen cabinet door was coming unhinged and almost fell off, no towel rack, no bedding for sofa bed, etc. Staff were not entirely professional nor did they seem very interested in us or our staying here. This is more of an apartment building than a hotel, but for the price (169 pounds/night in summer peak season), location, lots of space for a family, and the ability to stay only 4 nights, it suited us well."

2,747,"Oct 21 2009 	Suitable for backpackers only if price is cut to half.	Backpacker hotel advertised as 3 star hotel. BEWARE. I will never book with Expedia again.? Hotel description and reality did not match.The room was so small it was not possible to open the suitcase and the closet at the same time. The closet smelled like ded rats. It was not possible to lock the hotel room door from the inside and the security chain was broken. The private bath was across the corridor and had the same room no as our room. Very embarrasig to go to the toilet at night in your nighties. There was mould in the shower one very small bar of soap for two persons 3 nights and only two towels for two persons, that is no towel for hands and face. The hotel description said Hair dryer, was no hair dryer. The hotel description said free bottled water in the room, was no bottles of free water. it was a bit intimidating to go to breakfast with dripping hair every morning.In October the heating was on, could not turn it off which meant that we were grilled like tandoori chickens during the night. The bed was very close to the window so there was a tornado draft when we tried to get a more endurable temperature in the room.The staff was incredibly slow, had to wait for 10 minutes before they answered the doorbell when we arrived in the afternoon. Breakfast was advertised as very good by the hotel manager: a few slices of toast, marmelade, cheese and ham. Orange juice was served in 3cl glasses known as small schnapps glasses at home. Tea or some sort of brew, brownish, tasted less then the tea.(coffee?) Milk and cornflakes. Eggs either very hard boiled like rubber or hardly boiled at all. The only good thing was the location.  So in all; I think the hotel description at the Expedia site was very overstated and far from reality and the hotel should be taken away from the Expedia site or rating lowered to two stars. Could possibly be OK for backpackers at a much lower rate."

5,747,"Sep 2 2009 	Would never come back again	The original hotel that we have reserved turned out to be fully booked (the man at reception explained it is a mistake that we have received a reservation confirmation)and could not accomodate us, so the man at reception helped us in finding any space in the nearby area. The room at Georgian hotel was very dark and gloomy. It was a very hot night so we had to keep the windows open (they faced the road). The bath tub was either dirty or damaged (it had grey marks all over) and the water from the tap kelpt leaking all night long. There was no hairdryer.  It was impossible to get to sleep because of the road noise. The breakfast was included in the price of 105.00, however we never had a chance to eat there as we left at 7AM and the food was only served after 8AM.I absolutely hated staying at this hotel as neither of us had decent sleep, it costed a fortune and we found it very difficult to stay awake next day."
6,747,"Aug 22 2009 	No way!	Do not stay at this hotel! Filipinos receptionist is rude, they charge you too much for what they offer, breakfast is terrible and plastick. I saw menager and his wife playing cards in the office or guy was sleeping when I came. Breakfast girl and cleaner are fine but rest...do not think do not stay at this hotel!"
7,747,"Jul 30 2009 	The worst hotel I have visitet in the last 10 years...	First of all, the reseption/desk is &quot;closed&quot; so you have to go downstairs to the &quot;new&quot; reseptionroom to get your welcome and key, dark and dirty as the rest of the hotel... The lift NEVER works... The room size is smal, rooms and the bathroom are so old and dirty. When you sleep you hear people over, under, and beside you + drops falling in the bath... The first thing I saw was some red dots beside one of beds, I dont know what that was, but it cold be old blood drops....... However &quot;The Georgian Hotel&quot; should not be named as a Hotel, and how did the hotel get 3 stars? One star is too much for this.... So think again before reserving a room, and do not the same fault as me...Because stay in hotels like thisone will DESTROY your holiday, special if you are with your family...."
8,747,Jun 22 2009 	do not stay at this hotel	this hotel is awful.the manager and staff are rude and made us feel very unwelcome.staying here ruined our weekend we were having to celebrate.the breakfast was disgusting.we ended up eating macdonalds breakfast.its a total waste of money.you are not allowed to dirty their white towels.appalling hotel.cancel your booking now.you have been WARNED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
9,747,"Jun 2 2009 	Fawlty Towers is The Ritz in comparison	Without choking this review up with expletives, substandard, grotty and not worth the 90 quid a night (booked for 7 nights)My Fiancee and I had arrived from Australia via Ireland and York as part of a 3-week holiday, so we had large, heavy luggage of course. We Booked over the net without checking tripadvisor (not making that mistake again), for 7 nights, going to a wedding in London on the 2nd last day, so space and cleanliness was needed in our room.Checked in at reception, whose first comment was &quot;the room is too small for you&quot; (it was), &quot;we can't do anything until tomorrow as we are fully booked out&quot; (FA Cup Final). The room only had a room for a bed (double, not queen), a table, 1 power point and a shelf with a jug and some tea and coffee.The bathroom was a disgrace, mould in the showers, a small shaving cabinet, no iron or hair dryer in the room - told no iron because of 'fire risk&quot;, the hair dryer was available after 10:30 in the morning and my fiancee had to go down into the basement to iron the clothes.Fortunately only 1 night was paid for, we spent 2.5 hours looking that night for other accomodation, told reception we would not be staying the following 6 nights and caught a cab to The Shaftesbury Metyropolitan near Paddington railway station. It cost us another GBP 200+, but leaving The Georgian saved our holiday and early honeymoon.DO NOT STAY AT THE GEORGIAN!!!!!!!"
10,747,"Apr 1 2009 	Chicken Coup!!	DONT BELIEVE WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PICTURES!!This place is a dump! On arrival we were asked to be payed up front! the cheek! Our first impressions were that there were alot of mirrors! You would want to be a vain personLuckily our room had a bathroom in it. Ther breakfast was terrible, there was tiny glasses of orange juice, 2 selectons of cereal, coffee that was sitting there since 6am!, cheap plastic ham and cheese, a basket of boiled eggs(!),and lots of toast! Breakfast ended at 9.30 so you had to be up early to get food.They didnt have a restaurant either. Our room had a lovely view of a chicken coup! (The roof that looked like a pen for chickens) The floors in our bedroom were squeaky also!Each room was given a key. This key opened both the front door and our room door. does this key open every room in the hotel??The managers wife was not very pleasant at all!!The only good thing about this strange hotel was the location and it was cheap!! handy for what we wanted"
11,747,"Jan 20 2009 	Had to sleep on the floor	It is well known that one should expect all kinds of accomodation in London is at least one star below the rating. The Georgian Hotel at Gloucester Place was said to have a three star rating, so we did not expect more than something equal to a two star hotel anywhere else in the world.The location is great. A short walk from Baker Street station, and also within walking distance of Hyde Park and Oxford Street. But that is just about the only positive things worth to mention.First of all: Our bathroom was located across the hallway. Terribly intimidating, because we had to get dressed just to take a pee. There was no soap, and the shower only had cold water.And as I was going to London with a mate, I ordered a twin bed room. But when I arrived late at night due to a delayed flight, it turned out to be one single bed. And as the staff only were present until 10 PM, there were nothing to do about this before the next morning. So I could do nothing but sleep on the floor!When I confronted the unfriendly (Indian) hotel manager the next morning with this, he only said that they by no means needed to pay attention my room preference. So to get a bed to sleep in, we had to pay 60 pounds more to upgrade to a triple room!This is a definite no-go! Stay away!"
12,747,"Nov 11 2008 	Small and ""private"" bathroom across the hall	We arrived before check-in time, and had to leave our bags to go out on business. When we returned close to midnight we found our bags in an unlocked room close to the reception with no-one there. It would have been easy to steal... Then we went to our room, and we couldnt find the bathroom, after a closer look we found another door across the hall with our roomnumber, and voila, we found our bathroom! Low standard on everything, and the room was boiling hot in January, impossible to sleep without opening the window, and then the traffic-noise kept us awake. Breakfast not so good either, just some slices of toast, and we almost had to beg to get ham and cheese. Staff seemed like they didn't care much. Would not recommend this hotel to anybody."
13,747,"Oct 16 2008 	Crooked way to run business	Ridiculous runaround! Beware this is not the Georgia House Hotel (much nicer place and less expensive). We booked this several months in advance thinking it was the above mentioned- it's not! Then when we called the Wed to cancel the Fri we were told we could not despite it being 48 hours before - we had to contact the online agent that we had been routed to from their own website! Tick, tock goes the clock. Finding them online, finding,their number and now- their office was closed so tick, tock- by Thurs morn we were well past the 48hours only to be told by the online agent the hotel would have to process the cancel and refund! What? That was what they said about you. Upon calling the hotel again- &quot;NO CAN DO! you are past the 48 hours&quot; #$%^&amp;*! Absolutely crooked- sorry your hotel has bad ratings and you feel you should steal peoples money to survive."
14,747,"Sep 29 2008 	Couldn't have stayed here!	I was attracted by the location and the picture of the outside of the hotel, not to mention the great description on Lastminute.com. The reception area was very shabby, however, and the welcome unfriendly. I was shocked to discover my room's bathroom was across the corridor, and contained no toiletries at all, not even soap. It was dingy, not very clean, and the towel didn't look as though it had been properly washed. On returning to the room, I realised that this wasn't very clean either - the bedspread was awful, and the sheets were stained. The lock on the door was loose and insecure. When I asked if there were another room, I was told they were fully booked - the receptionist's attitude was very aggressive and unhelpful. When I told them I would be transferring to another hotel, they said there would be no refund. To cap it all, they failed to call the taxi I'd requested! I ended up staying at the Euston Square nearby, for about the same cost and it was fabulous! (And I eventually got a full refund from Lastminute, so there's a happy ending!)"
15,747,"Sep 7 2008 	Location is the only good point	Definitely, this is a substandard accommodation.I know how expensive hotels in London can be, but for sure this is one of those that do not make you feel like you got what you paid for at all.Staff was quite unfriendly, at least to us. The room was small and rundown, the locks to lock yourself from inside did not work, so there was a funny situation every morning when the cleaner was about to come in and we were still in bed!The remote control for the TV didn't work, and the floor was annoyingly squeaky. Be aware that what they call a &quot;private bathroom&quot; is a bathroom only you can use, but it's across the corridor, and you have to use the key to open both doors, which makes the whole experience of going to the bathroom at night a nightmare, including the noisy doors and floorboards.The breakfast was also substandard, and you have to beg for more toasts. The glasses for the orange juice were the size of a shot!!"
16,747,Jan 18 2008 	good location and thats all	The Hotel is run down and in need of a face lift. the elevator broke down and was not fixed while we were there. The taps in the bathroom driped all day and night. They said there was Wi Fi access available throughout the hotel but it didn't work on my computer or pda . They both worked down the street at the coffee shop.
17,747,"Jul 30 2007 	Great Location	We stayed here for 3 nights on a recent trip to London. The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from Baker St tube station and is close to local shops.The hotel was reasonably clean and the reception was OK. There was no-one manning the reception desk when we arrived but they soon came to greet us.The room was basic but clean. We stayed in room 12 which was on the 3rd floor. It had a double bed, wardrobe, TV and tea/coffee facilities.The thing we found odd was the en suite bathroom that was actually across the landing. It was a private bathroom but not the most convenient when you need the loo at 3 in the morning.The breakfast was basic but again passable. Consisted of unlimited supply of tea/coffee and juice, toast, cereak and eggs, cheese, ham etc. Was OK but some good cooked food would be welcome.All in all, a basic hotel but as we were in London for the sights and shopping etc, the hotel served more as a base to return each night.Staff were friendly and I would stay again for a budget hotel next time I am in London"
18,747,"Jul 9 2007 	Should have read the reviews before I booked	Unfortunately i wasn't clever enough to read the reviews of this hotel before me and my friend booked it some time ago. As we were going to a gig in Wembley we wanted somewhere quite central but also not too far from Wembley, and seeing as most of the hotels had been already booked this seemed the perfect choice. From what we could see from the pictures and write up, it seemed reasonable for the price.Like previous reviews of the hotel the entrance way is the best feature of the hotel, because as soon as you step inside its another story. There was no one on the front desk so we had to look for the proprietor. The owner was helpful enough and allowed us into the room some hours before the check-in time because we wouldnt be back till after midnight that night. The room was small and even though we expected a twin room we settled for a double bed...which was not a double bed, it was only slightly bigger than a single. There was no ensuite as stated in the booking, the bathroom was out of the door and a couple of steps across the landing. The shower was not appealing, some of the tiles had come off the wall and not been replaced. Also, we had to walk past the next room to get to the bathroom which was very inconvienient but also an annoyance for the couple next door as we had to unlock two doors to get into the bathroom and the floor boards creaked!On return after the gig our room key allowed us to get into the front door, middle door and our bedroom door...this made me wonder if our key, and everybody elses in the hotel, opened every door! This maybe why our bedroom door had a security chain...which wasn't particularly secure! The noise from the back of the hotel went on until the early hours, not traffic as stated in other reviews but some kind of pub or nightclub?Next morning we expected something decent for breakfast but was given some toast, cereal and a boiled egg in dated and quite frankly grubbly looking crockery! To be fair the waiting staff there were pleasant!The icing on the cake is when around 9.30am we had a call from, who i assume to be , the owners wife. She asked us when we would be leaving. We said when it was time to check out cos we were killing time before we caught the train home. She was extremely rude to my friend and even accused us of not paying for the room...which we had done when we checked it. So she said she was going to check. about 30 mins later the cleaner was knocking on the door asking when we were due to leave!To be honest, the sooner we left the better because about a hour after we left I came up in bites over my legs and arm! I am prone to bites anyway but it wasnt much of a shock to me it wasnt the most cleanest of the hotels.In summary, for location it is fantastic, theres a few nice pubs around and its close to the tube. Some of the staff were also helpful. However, even though it was cheap and I didnt expect the Hilton for my money, everything about the hotel was way below average!!!"
19,747,"Jun 13 2007 	Great Location	Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in early June. The hotel manager was very helpful. We were charged to have a hair dryer in our room even though the ad states one is supplied. We asked to be moved from a very noisy room to the back of the hotel and were charged a nominal fee for a bigger room at the back. Carpets need to be cleaned - updates need to be made. We stayed our third night at the Clarion Hotel - which was much cleaner, much more modern, better service and less money."
20,747,"Apr 2 2007 	Georgian Hotel review	We stayed in this older London hotel for 3 nights in late March. I was a little fearful since there were so many negative views of this hotel, but we were pleasantly surprised. It was located an easy walk from the Victoria Station.Yes, the rooms were small, but not the smallest I have stayed in when visiting London. There were four of us in our room and for the amount of time we stayed in the room, it was quite adequate. The staff was pleasant and helpful, both a full English breakfast and a continental breakfast was available. There was a computer in the front lobby which could be used for a small fee. If you are willing to take a chance, there are many bed and breakfasts around Victoria Station, but I don't know how their price compared to this hotel."
21,747,"Oct 25 2006 	As stated before stay away	My London trip was October 10-15, 2006 and I booked at the above hotel in May. Well thanks to the reviews here I decided not to go there. However for me when I made my reservation (by e-mail on my own) they took a deposit from my credit card. To make a long story short I have returned from my trip and I still can't get them to give me my money back. Credit card company is no help because according to them they need a cancellation notice from the hotel and I have spent a small fortune calling them (Georgian) and all I get is the run around. Seems things can get a bit stickey oversees (I have not idea what thay means but thats that I was told from the credit card co).Bad way to do business so I can be chalk this up to experience and be happy I found a better class London hotel to spend my time and money at."
22,747,"Mar 25 2006	Avoid at all costs!!!	The hotel looks very nice in pictures on the [--------]website. DO NOT be deceived! Other than the entryway leading up to the front door, it is shabby and extremely unappealing. But the biggest problem is the proprietess who treated us extremely rudely. When she assigned us a room with a &quot;private bathroom&quot; across the hall, we explained that we had been assured there would be a bathroom in the room. She didn't care. She also didn't care that the lift wasn't working (we're thinking they will never spend the money to repair it) and my 88 year old mother had to walk four flights of stairs when there were rooms available on lower floors. The traffic noise made it impossible to sleep, the beds were not comfortable and I'm fairly certain that I contracted some kind of bug sleeping in them! Do NOT stay at the Georgian Hotel!"
23,747,Feb 23 2006 	Depressing	I wish I had read other visitor's opinions before I booked this hotel. Although the general location is good it is on a noisy street. The room and general apperance of the place was depressing. The shower in the bathroom functioned poorly. Breakfast adequate but abysmal coffee. Basic things like a bar of soap and glass absent. Poor value for money even by budget standards. All I can say in its favour is that the staff were pleasant.
24,747,"Feb 1 2006	Horrendous	3*? I'd love to know who rated this hotel 3*!The lights above the bed were fastened to the wall with cellotape, the bed was uncomfortable, the bath was stained and filthy. We got absolutely no sleep as it was so noisy outside and the breakfast consisted of boiled eggs and toast with the most rancid coffee I have ever tasted. Staying in a budget hotel, I don't expect to get the complimentary toiletries and the usual hotel luxuries but this hotel was probably the worst I have ever stayed in. What made the situation worse was knowing we could have stayed in the Selfridge hotel for a few pounds extra. Never again."
25,747,"Aug 4 2005	Bait 	In May 2005 my husband and I set off on my dream vacation to England. We had a spectacular time for ten days, until we received word that both my daughter and elderly father had been hospitalized and were to have emergency surgery. I called the Georgian Hotel in London approximately 36 hours prior to our intended arrival time to inform them that we would be leaving England early due to a medical emergency back home and was informed that we would still be charged for one night's stay, as we had missed the 48 hour deadline for cancellations. The gentleman I spoke to said if I submitted a doctor's note on hospital letterhead explaining the situation they would refund my money. This I did, along with other hospital documents detailing the emergency. I received an email a week later from the hotel saying that they could not refund my money because of the 48 hour cancellation notice. If they had told me that they had no intention of making a refund I would not have gone to the trouble of getting a doctor's note and the other documentation. I'm disputing the charge with my credit card company and expect the dispute to be decided in my favor."
26,747,"Jul 13 2004	Great Location	This hotel is an average quality establishment. The low cost, excellent location and friendly service redeemed its lack of updated quality. The room was quite old and small  no modernization. The bathroom was small and lacked counter space on which to place toiletries. There was a small medicine cabinet to place small personal items. The tub had a hand-held shower nozzle, which made it a little tricky to bathe. The beds were a little bumpy, but reasonably comfortable once settled in. Since personal irons were prohibited, guests were required to use the hotel iron located in the office/basement area. The iron and ironing board were ancient and outdated. The iron only worked properly if the main power switch on the wall was turned off and on every 30 seconds or so; this made ironing an extensive task. The continental buffet-style breakfast consists of dry cereal, sliced meat, hard-boiled eggs, white or wheat toast, orange juice, and hot tea. The quality of service was good. The elevator was very convenient between the hours of 7:30 A.M. to 10:00 P.M.. Because it only operated during specific times, if guests left early in the morning or returned from a late night engagement, they were required to travel up/down several flights of steep stairs. Above all, if you can overlook many minor inconveniences and the quality of the facility, youll enjoy the convenience of the excellent location. The hotel is only a 5-8 minute walk to the Baker Street tube station and is close to Oxford Street stores and attractions. If you keep a positive attitude, youll enjoy your stay."
27,747,Jan 31 2003	Eye Opener	The hotel is conveniently located (by European Standards) to the metro. Because of their location they were fairly expensive. When we checked in the rooms were awful...single lightbulbs hanging down. bathroom was so small only 1 person at a time. tight tight tight. Windows were terrible - the old woodwn double-hung with paint splintering off. (Musty moldy mildewy) It's just such an old building there's only so much cleaning and sprucing up you can do without having a major overhaul. the one (and only one) redeeming quality was the breakfast. It was very good and plentiful. We spent around $200 for 2 adults and 2 kids in a cramped room of approximately 80-100 square feet.

36,747,Sep 4 2008	i had stayed 10 days in these hotel
1,749, wash my hands in the sink and clean my legs in the shower all at the same time if i wanted. I was on the top floor which is quite a hike from reception as there is no lift
2,749, great breakfasts or good conversations with the hotelstaff
3,749, which they were not!) and the fitted carpets had not been cleaned for ages. Also the towels and sheets were untidy
4,749, I could not believe it was still operating. There were stains on the bed spreads
5,749, the rooms are incredibly small and they cram fold-up beds into small rooms and call them 'family rooms'. The staff are useless and stole items from our suitcase while we were away from the room. There are firedoors propped open and the diningroom consists of foldout tables and chairs in the very small reception area. What a DUMP. We got out of there before our reservation days were complete and were so happy we didn't ask for our money back.	
6,749, I did make sure that I was able to get out of the hotel by a window if there had been a fire.The Hotel itself needs updating and refubishment. NOT recommended.	
7,749, which unwillingly we paid. We entered the new hotel and room which we found to be a single room with a sofa (we had paid for a double room)
8,749, 2 double beds ( good quiet nights sleep!)Small bathroom
9,749, or the shower head holder which was shattered and so you needed to hold the shower yourself. The bathroom was so small you couldnt sit on the toilet properly unless you had the door open
10,749, where the rooms are micro-sized!!! So small that we hardly had space to open up our luggages!! If the room is microsized
11,749, and I had two different rooms. The first room
12,749, the toilet is a laugh
13,749, old beds no lifts lots of narrow stairs . just really really gross	
14,749, if not you will be standing around waiting helpless anyway. And don't expect much spread - it's bread
15,749, &amp; it is located close to Paddington Station &amp; Hyde Park. On our 1st stay we were on the top floor &amp; the stairs were 'interesting' for my husband who has bad knees but the desk clerk helped
16,749, but I did not expect an US style hotel where you could even bring your car into the room. The hotel is clean
17,749, with broken light fixtures and badly needing a paint job in the room. The bathroom is a story in itself- you couln't stand in there without touching the toilet seat and the door with either leg. Way too small
18,749, but inside seemed ok.Reception very helpful. My room was no. 11
19,749, and for a budget hotel
20,749, one cup and saucer between three which was dirty
21,749, we have stayed in other places at a similar price which felt like the Ritz compared to Glendale. Our room (we had a twin room) was small and the sheets were dirty. The toilet was so small that we had to leave the door open. The 'continental' breakfast was served in the reception area. The man at the desk was pleasent but only when we first checked in and when he was not dealing with complaints. The location is very good but despite this
22,749, i.e. sizewise four adults) were squeezed into a room that should have been fitting as a very small double. There was almost no floor space available
23,749, and it really was affordable. I paid 35 GBP for six nights for a total of 210 GDP. I couldn't of ask for a better price and a clean place to sleep. I had searched othe places to stay on the web and most for that price per night you had to share a bathroom with other. At least at this hotel you get your own private bathroom. If i go back to London
24,749, which in london was a good price.The only really bad thing I can say about this hotel is that the ensuite was absolutely tiny (about 6 feet by 3feet) so it was a bit of a squeeze to get in and out.But otherwise it was ideal for us. The room was very clean and the decor was fresh (ok bedding was 1960's design but was clean)
1,755, I woke up with about 15 &quot;bites&quot; all over my body. Had checked the room for mozzies before going to sleep and again in the morning
2,755, etc. The main problem with the room was noise from all night traffic on Gower Street
3,755, but they didn't ask me to change rooms when it became busy on the weekend
4,755, scrupoulously clean room
1,768,May 27 2009 	Excellent value for money	The 3 of us (wife and 16-year old) stayed for 3 nights in a triple room. The hotel is in an excellent location close to the Shepherds Bush tube. Our room was big enough
2,768,May 11 2009 	grotty little room	stayed for one night
3,768,Apr 20 2009 	No Key	walking into the hotel
4,768,Dec 31 2008 	Handy for the infamous Shepherds Bush Walkabout!!	Had a single night at the Grantly Hotel
5,768,Nov 18 2008 	Great value - 3 bed	Clean reasonably priced. Good location. Internet (wifi 3 GBP/day)friendly staff. big room (3 bed) !!!	
6,768,Oct 14 2008	Don't do it!	I would never recommend this place to anyone. They run some kind of scam with a far less pleasant hotel across the otherside of the green called The Abbey. They regularly overbook the rooms then ship the unlucky ones to this other hotel which resembles some kind of bail hostel.The Grantly itself looked nice from what we saw i.e. the reception. But then we were given some rubbish story about a water leak and we had to stay somewhere else. This is dispite the fact he had only rang me the day before to confirm I still wanted the room.The man at the Abbey was happy to tell me they work in partnership and the Grantly overbooked. I agree it's great for the empire but not great if you end up being one of the unlucky ones and ending up where we did!!!	
7,768,Jul 28 2008 	Just right	Great little Hotel. It is a budget hotel
8,768,Jul 3 2008 	not realy clean and recommendable	The room and the equipment is very old and in a bad condition. The bedspread was full of small spots and dirty. I don't know what is older the room it self or the bath room. The room was not hoovered and everywhere was dust.Good was the breakfast and the equipment outside of the room
9,768,May 7 2008 	AWEFUL!	We booked a hotel which was close to the BBC studios. When we arrived the entrance was lovely and certainly my first impresssions were good. He then took us next door to where we would be staying and my eyes filled up nearly. We walked into our room and it was terrible
10,768,Mar 3 2008 	Great value close to the Shepherds Bush Empire	I first stayed at this hotel in May 2002 and thought it was great value for money then being approx £60 per room per night including breakfast and parking. I was pleasantly surprised when I stayed again in February 2008 and it was still the same good value and only slightly more money. The rooms are clean and tidy
11,768,Dec 17 2007 	Perfect for the Empire	Stayed at the Grantly after a gig at the Empire. Couldn't be closer to the venue - can see the entrance from the bedroom window! Clean
12,768,Nov 13 2007 	Great location for the Empire	We were up in London to see the Alarm and wanted to stay overnight so after checking out a few other places on the road up to the Green (which were either booked or abysmal) we came upon the Grantly. The room was in the building next door and was very warm
13,768,Apr 26 2007 	Good for Shepherd's Bush Empire on a budget	Given some of the previous reviews here
14,768,Feb 2 2007 	A night I will always remember!!	I stayed in the Grantly on 14th February 2006 as was seeing a show at the Empire.On arrival at the main hotel reception it looked great
15,768,Jun 28 2006	basic but great location and free parking!	Have stayed twice at Grantly when going to the Shepherds Bush Empire for gigs. Great location just across the road with a good Italian restaurant just a few doors away and a couple of pubs should you want them. The rooms are basic and small but have been clean on both occasions
16,768,May 7 2006	Budget Hotel you get what you pay for.	We stayed at the Grantly Hotel for £62 on a Saturday night in May 06. We were attending a concert at the Shepherds Bush Empire &amp; wanted a hotel close by. The hotel location was fantastic 200 yds from the Empire &amp; really close to the tube station.However the double room was very small and not particularly clean
17,768,Dec 3 2005 	Grantly is ace	Stayed at the Grantly last night and it was brilliant. I was a bit skeptical as to whether to book it or not after reading so many bad reviews
18,768,Oct 22 2005	If you value your life -- do not stay here!	Booked for one night - Room 23 !!! Did not stay
19,768,May 25 2005	Grantely Hotel - BEWARE!	My husband and I stayed there last weekend and paid £75+. The place is a dump. From the outside it looks quite nice however when we got to our room we were seriously disappointed. The room was so dirty. Dirt or and other substances on the walls
20,768,Dec 7 2004	Never going there again!!	We stayed here at the end of november..what can I say..what a dump!! We paid 60 pound for a double room. The room was very small. Just as well we are small people coz the bathroom door couldnt be opened properly as there was a desk in the way. The sheets were dirrty (we slept with our clothes on!)
21,768,Oct 24 2004	Grantly Hotel is great value!!	I needed a single room in Shepherds Bush London for just one night. Knowing the prices of hotels (and indeed things in general) in London I was startled to see that the Grantly Hotel charges only £35 for a single room including breakfast. I almost discounted staying there as I figured something that cheap couldnt be any good. How wrong I was! The hotel is great! The reception area was spotless
22,768,Jul 2 2004	Very good 3 star	Hi there

1,769,May 13 2009 	Budget Hotel in Earl`s Court	Stayed with a friend of mine at this hotel. staff was very friendly all time. breakfast time is from 8 till 9
2,769,Feb 28 2008	It was ok.	We were stuck (tough to get something reasonable for 3 people)and took a chance (been some bad reviews)and it was ok. Sure there is mold
3,769,Sep 20 2007 	Filthy bug infested hotel	Don't even think about staying at this filthy hotel. It is infested with bed bugs. My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a week and got bitten at least 50 times each
4,769,Jul 10 2007	Neutral feelings after 4 nights	Cheap considering the price level in London. The quality was accordingly low - as expected
5,769,Feb 5 2007	Awful - dont go!! 	Just returned from a stay in London and had to stay in this god-awful hotel. There where 6 of us staying in 2 triple rooms. Room 1 was small and smelt of mould
6,769,Aug 15 2006 	Nice :)	We went to this hotel for 4 nights. It's a small hotel
7,769,Jun 18 2006	Worst Hotel ever	Dirty
8,769,Jun 1 2006	Decent price/quality ratio	I had to book a room at the last minute and this hotel suited my needs. The location can't be beat (a short walk to tube stop) and we enjoyed the coffee and toast in the morning. We had the first floor room behind the reception desk; it was decent sized
9,769,Jan 4 2006	Bad experience	I visited this hotel with my husband for 4 days. It was a bad choice. It was terribly worn and dirty. My elbows and knees got red and itchy because of the products they used to clean the sheets. The bed was so uncomfortable I ended the trip with a backache. Our room was right behind the front desk and we could hear the front door bell everytime
10,769,Jul 7 2004	Don't go!!	In this hotel there is not a fair ratio between the price and the quality. Don't prebook
11,769,Jun 3 2004	Basic inexpensive hotel	Spent one night at the Green Court on my way back through London. Had booked a single (tiny) ensuite that I saw before booking but when I checked in was given a double on the ground floor at the back. So the room was quite large and comfortable. It and the bath were clean although somewhat worn. The hotel did not seem to be full
12,769,Apr 21 2004	not good at all	not very good hotel. dissappointing weekend still trying to sort out complaint with hotel over poor hygiene	
13,769,Mar 30 2004	It's OK	Just came back from London trip stayted in this hotel. This is an average hotel. Rooms are average. It is bit noisy. It seems like the walls are too thin. We could hear other people talking out side the room
14,769,May 17 2009 	Hotel correct pour courts séjours		
15,769,Oct 24 2008 	????????????		
16,769,Apr 15 2008 	Hotel à éviter !!!		
1,770,"Oct 23 2009 	YUCK!!	Tired,dirty and rooms like cells - rooms in basement were gross offered alternatives but no better really.En suite was tiny - hair and blood on the toilet and wash basin.Please don't waste your money - reported findings but staff not concerned - responded with a shrug."
2,770,"Oct 22 2009 	Worst hotel. Ever.	I stayed in the Grenville House hotel for one night while travelling through London. As soon as I saw the room my first impulse was to turn around and go find another place to stay, but since I arrived quite late at night that wasn't an option. I really have nothing good to say about the hotel. Here are the facts:- It smells like mildew. You too will smell like a walking fungus by the time you leave.- The room (or should I say broom closet? It doesn't really deserve to be called a room) was in the basement--tiny, dark, damp and right by the noisy street.- I heard every single mouse fart in the neighbourhood. People on the street, snoring somewhere in the hotel, someone going to the bathroom--and it all sounded like it was happening right next to my bed.- Wind and damp came in through the window. There was no heating, so I spent the night wearing tights, socks, a cardigan and a jacket along with my PJs to stave off the cold.- Dirty sheets and towels. I periodically woke up itching all over and--lo and behold--discovered bites on my legs the next day.- The integrated shower/toilet cubicle appears to have once belonged to a caravan. And no prizes for guessing that it was dirty.I can't comment on the breakfast. I got up very early and fled, without bothering to find out how many cockroaches or mouse droppings they served up alongside the sliced bread and processed cheese.If there is a hell it surely is modelled on the Grenville House. Would not wish this on my worst enemy. Stay well away!"
3,770,"Jul 14 2009 	Dirty noisy - do not stay there!	I am used to basic budget hotels and am very easily pleased, but the only good thing about this hotel is it's location. It's dirty, noisy and the breakfast room was crowded and with very very poor service. The room was dirty with grease on every surface and the bathroom was vile. Guests were banging the front door all night. Coffee at breakfast was a dried up jar of Nescafe on the table... Really horrible. I guess they get away with it as they will never have a shortage of bookings, being in such a good location."
4,770,"Jul 13 2009 	A filthy obnoxious and despicable place !!!!	Greniville Hotel is the worst hotel I have ever seen.The rooms are extremely small ,dirty and the very very overpriced in comparison to what the hotel has to offer.The rooms were never cleaned,the sheets and towels were dirty (I suspect that they hadnt changed them for over a month).There was dust everywhere and the bathroom was barely for one person.The so called breakfast was not worth waking up for.I complained twice in the reception about not cleaning the room and nothing changed.They called us twice at 7:30 in the morning asking us to pay them despite that our check out date was 3 days later.The only positive thing was the location (close to Russel square ) but this was not enough to cover the price for this filthy place.Spare yourselves 10-20 more pounds per person and avoid staying in this rathole."
5,770,"Feb 15 2008 	A Shocking Hole - Wouldn't let my Dog Stay Here	Stayed here for one night.Room was absolutely filthy - floor clearly not hoovered, bed linen dirty and bathroom was the worst I have ever seen!!There was no soap, shampoo or toilet paper, I had to go to the 24 hour store down the road to buy these things because I checked in at 11pm.There was grime and dirt all over the bathroom, when I got into the shower and pulled back the shower door........to my horror, there was a long, big, thick black strand of hair from the previous occupant stuck to the door, I nearly wretched.The room was freezing cold, the radiators didnt work and I actually got under the covers fully clothed and slept like that.The room was so poorly cleaned I even put my bag on one of the other beds because I didn't want to get anything contaminated.I didnt read the reviews before going to this hotel, however I have just seen the pictures of the bedrooms and I can promise you they are NOTHING like that in the hotel.The only reason I didnt check out there and then was because I had nowhere else to go, the Comfort Inn, Premier Inn &amp; Travel Lodge in Kings Cross were all fully booked.STAY AWAY from this Hole - You have all been warned!!!!!!"
6,770,"Jan 9 2007 	Very overpriced budget accommodation	This is without a doubt a budget hotel. I booked it because it was one of the cheapest I could find in a central London location. The room (a double) was freezing--the heat was turned off during certain hours, I was told, because most of the guests are not there during the day. However, it never seemed to get warm, even at night when you'd expect the heat to be turned on. The hot water seemed to be on a timer as well--one day it was warm, the next it was lukewarm at best. When I told the reception about it, the response I received was &quot;that's impossible.&quot; The toilet leaked after flushing it, the bathroom had a very unpleasant smell emanating from it, and the television remote control was broken. I can accept these problems to some extent if I'm expecting budget accommodation, but at 70 ($140 for me as an American) a night, that's not a budget price. Breakfast, which was provided by individuals that were difficult to communicate with, was very basic and entirely rushed. The only positive thing is the location, which was still a bit of a walk from the nearest tube stop. I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all unless their prices were lowered significantly."
1,778,Nov 22 2009 	Excellent Value For Money	I can not understand a couple of the reviews below. What did you expect for 35 a night in London- the Ritz?The staff were extremely friendly to me and the breakfast was ok- this is one of the best value for money hotels in London.
2,778,"Sep 12 2009 	disappointing hotel but London is great	Booked this hotel for late August but when arrived hotel did not have any knowledge of our booking even though we had confirmation so our initial impression of this hotel was tainted! Bad points 1] hotel looked run down from outside with tiles fallen off front step and not replaced 2] our room had no blind because a previous visitor had broken it and although we were told it would be fixed we had to make do with a bedsheet taped to the window 3] my father-in-law's single room was not ensuite although that's what we had booked and the door would not lock, this was fixed for our second night. Good points 1] the hotel had a couple of rooms so we were able to stay 2] we got our booking fee back from Travelstay.com with no quibble after I phoned them on our return home but not the booking + credit card fee which was charged even though they failed to make the booking (according to the hotel they said this had happened before!) 3] pleasant location was quiet and only short walk to nearest tube 4] plenty of shops, bars and good pub 4] breakfast ok"
3,778,"Sep 1 2009 	Worth the money	We stayed in a B&amp;B from Friday - Monday. Some advices:1. ring before you arrive to double check if you have your room, as ours was on the system but not in their guest book they are working from!!! So if we wouldn't ring I dont know if we would have a room.2. When we arrived the landlady and landlord are OK, but not very welcoming - that was our feeling as we stayed in few B&amp;B before and compared.3. Room was very nice, new and clean a bit small but for us two it was enough as we were only sleeping there. Room had a private bathroom VERY BIG ADVANTAGE!!! As there were rooms with sharing bathroom and WC ... looked inside - not nice very old tiles. But our room was perfect with private bathroom - request when you doing your booking.3. Provided tea and coffee at room, the kettle didnt work properly but we figured out to make it work :-) not big issue.4. Breakfast room - very small if you have lots of people staying over, but go early and you will be sorted :-)5. Breakfast - they put it as a full breakfast but to my opinion it wasn't that great( 1 egg, 1 sausage, 1 warm tomatoe, 2-3 slices bacon, beans) - not a great deal but OK, also cereals and jams. 6.Every room had a old doors and I have to tried to figured out how to lock it but managed to do it - they should update it a little bit also the carpets were a little to much for me :-)6. Guests in other rooms a bit noisy - no respect that others might sleep but when you sharing a bathroom no wonder :-)7. Hotel is in a very nice area, we haven't been scared to walk around. Lots of restaurants and take aways around. We have also found a shortcut throught the Sainsbury to go to the Tube Station. The street where the hotel is situated is very nice and quiet, that is what you need. I would recommend this hotel as it is not bad and worth of money and in a nice area. Of course need a little bit of improvment but it's ok for money. If you are posh don't look for cheap B&amp;B if you want to just sleep and get into the London it is a perfect location and hotel for you. Its on central line too, so to get to London takes max. 30 minutes. My review is very honest, because I would like to help others to choose what they want, but go for a private bathroom is nothing worse to share it :-) We are giving a rate 4/5 as I mention before there are things which could improve but I hope they will because its a nice B&amp;B to stay in."
4,778,"Aug 8 2009 	Threatened with mugging robbed of my deposit...worst hotel in London	I booked a room here in July, and was denied entry, told &quot;I have a terrible attitude&quot; and threatened with a mugging on my way out. The only plausible reason I can think of for being given this treatment was my ethnicity.Stay away from this place - you will be all the more happier and safer for it."
5,778,"Aug 3 2009 	Rubbish	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for night and that was too long. We were told the room was ensuite it was not, it had a toilet and sink. The carpets were all stained, the furniture looked like it came out of the ark. The only good thing I could say that the bed linen was clean. This hotel needs complete modernisation. Breakfast was included in the price but we did not fancy eating there. We only seen one of the staff and then is when we booked in."
6,778,"Nov 30 2008 	Update - Modernisation almost complete	I stayed for a second time at this hotel and can confirm that the manager's response to my previous review is accurate. Many of the rooms have been updated since my last stay, and the remainder appeared to be in the process of redecoration while I was there.As before, I stayed in a basic single though this time it had new furniture and fittings. As before the 33 price included a good breakfast, tea and coffee making facilities (including biscuits) and a full size TV.The hotel remains one of the best value places to stay in London and its relative proximity to South Woodford Tube Station makes it feasible for those on a break as well as for business visitors. I would suggest, though, that some holiday visitors might find the breakfast times of 7 to 8.30 a little early."
1,779,May 17 2009 	Cool stop at a cool spot	My second stay at this &quot;boutique&quot; hotel and staying a couple of days gave more time to explore .Realised what a great location this is.Morning stroll around Notting Hill and on to Portobello road in the sunshine is a great way to spend a few hours.A real cafe culture exists and I found it totally relaxing to be staying away from the usual hustle and bustle.Very much a convert to this area for future staysThe staff are extremely helpful and nothing seems to be too much trouble....when we took a late breakfast on Saturday morning and found no plain croissants our waitress simply nipped out to the nearby bakery and bought some more!!The rooms I would describe as New York Hip....a little on the small side but with everything you need and extremely stylish.Our friends stayed in one of the larger(slightly more expensive) terraced rooms which was also very stylish.
2,779,"May 15 2009 	Awesome	Decided to have a weekend away with my girlfriend...We arrived on Friday and were greeted by friendly staff at the reception, infact all the staff were really helpful and were always ready to serve you. Went out on Friday night, some really nice places nearby BBB to mention one. On Saturday the weather was perfect and the hotel has an amazing terrace. We sat under the umbrellas and ate a nice relaxing lunch. The service is excellent and could not fault it. To our surprise the bill was very reasonable too. I would of thought with such a great location and the area that we would pay a premium We got speaking to the manger that is from South Africa, being from SA ourselves, and he was really helpful with telling us all the nearby attractions and offered to organise tickets for us to go watch Oliver. Its was really an awesome weekend away and would recommend this hotel for anyone who enjoys personal service and a nice &quot;funky&quot; atmosphere"
3,779,"Apr 9 2009 	Stylish friendly and hugely convenient	We stayed two nights and we were delighted to find a boutique hotel with a touch of class. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, the food taken delicious, and our room, although small, was more than sufficient, We had the benefit of a corner room (no.18) so our bathroom was larger and lighter. We particularly enjoyed the informality of the lounge/bar and the deck outside offer the same lovely food and the opportunity to spot the famous of Notting Hill. The shopping around the hotel is fabulous - almost no need to go elsewhere. It is truly a little gem and should really remain our secret. Easy parking."
4,779,Mar 26 2009 	excellent boutique hotel	returned to this hotel after a few years as doing business in the area again; hotek quality remained superb; staff were friendly and efficient; breakfast self service but more than adequate; location perfect for notting hill/petticoat lane and about 15 mibns walk from kensington high st.
5,779,"Feb 22 2009 	Good place to stay for a Notting Hill area visit	I'll get the small amount of negatives out of the way and then hit on the positives. Please do read the positives. Neg:While this hotel is in a great location once you get there, it is about a 10 minute walk to a Tube station (Notting Hill Gate or Bayswater). The walk itself is nice, but I would only want to do it in nice weather as I found it inconvenient in cold or bad weather. I was frozen walking from the Tube to the hotel upon arrival in the frigid weather and had to take a taxi to the airport upon departure because it was pouring. As I was there in February, it was very cold. The heat (central, no radiator) in my room did not heat my room. The staff first told me to let the heat run for about an hour to heat up the room. It never did. And, the heater was obnoxiously loud when running on the high setting. They offered to switch my room, but given a little experiment we did, I do not think the other room (can't recall #) would heat up sufficiently either. Also, this other room had a bathroom the size of a small closet compared to my assigned room (#8), which had a wonderfully sized and comfortable bathroom. Also, the alternative room faced the street and had a larger window (makes the room colder...) and my assigned room faced the back and had a smaller window. In the end, they provided me with a space heater, which did sufficiently warm the room. Unfortunately there was no way to regulate the heat with the space heater, so I had to keep turning it off when too hot and on when too cold. Note that the room rates do not include VAT. Now, on to the positives...Pos:The hotel is located near many great shops, cafes, restaurants and a mall that has restraurants, shops and a movie theater. Portobello Road is walking distance from the hotel as well. In nicer, warmer weather and for a stay in the Notting Hill area, I would return to this hotel. The room I stayed in was comfortable (except for the heat issue). I didn't care that there are no lifts, but some may. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I liked the lounge in the reception and my friends and I did relax and have drinks there. I did not try any of the breakfasts, though included in the rate. You can rent DVDs in your room for a charge and a deposit (returned upon check out). I never quite understood if there is free internet access if you do not have a laptop as there is a charge to rent a laptop from the hotel. There is WiFi as my friend brought her laptop which we used for Internet searching without issue. Also, the staff told me they would have checked me into my flight and printed my boarding pass had I not done it myself using a stranger's laptop in a cafe. They also negotiated a decent fare for a taxi for me. Email me if you want the name and number of the driver. He picks up from Heathrow for 45GBP (no extra fees) and will take you to Heathrow from your hotel for 35GPB (no extra fees)."
6,779,"Feb 17 2009 	Notting Chill	The great thing about this hotel is that is plugs you directly into the exciting, slightly off-beat, and decidedly trendy Notting Hill. The staff are great if you actually TALK to them (seems like something the negative reviewers forgot) and ask them about where's good to go locally. We live pretty close by but often sneak away for a holiday on our doorstep - no chores, no routine, just enjoying one of London's most interesting areas. You can get the better rooms by - again, shock horror - talking to the reservations person. But wake up - this is NH, and real estate comes in 1000 per square foot if you want to buy. Getting a hundred and fifty or so square feet for anything under 200 for a night is value. Plus, take a tip from the name: Guesthouse. It's not a Four Seasons or a Mandarin O and doesn't want to be. It's a small neighbourhood hotel in one of the world's most desirable neighbourhoods, and I wish there was something like it in similarly interesting places the world over."
7,779,"Jun 14 2008 	Good place	I stayed here with my wife in June 2008, and we really liked it. We stayed in room 4, I dont know about the other rooms but room 4 was awesome. The room had a little shared back area\porch which was nice. It was decorated very modern and the AC worked really good (AC is always a big deal for me), plus it was very quiet. The location is perfect (notting hill), its the NYC equivalent to soho. The lobby\bar is the only thing that isnt that cute, but who cares theres other bars in the area. I would definitly stay here again, if you like the 60 thompson in NYC youll like this hotel."
8,779,May 21 2008 	Complete Miss at Guesthouse West	We had booked our stay via the website of the property and had received confirmaton. When I was re-confirming I sent an email with the wrong dates (my own fault) the hotel changed the dates without asking why... As we were in a different country with no access to phone or email - they charged us for the two rooms one night each. When we finallly reached Rome - with internet and phone for one day - I was in a state of Panic the hotel staff tried to find the two rooms but only had one for the dates we needed. The comment I recieved was if it was our fault I would find you two rooms - but we only have one available. So to avoid charges I decided to break the family up - and book the one room. She was going to speak with her manager and send an email confirming. I had my husband looking for her email (as he was not on the holiday). When we arrived in the UK I called the hotel as my husband stated there was never an email. They had released the room as I had not called back. ( we had no phone service and this was relayed to her!!)All in all we are now being charged 300 for not staying here and it is unfortunate..as it is in a great area. I was hoping to be able to put a positive review here -although my friend stayed here last week and did confirm the rooms are really tiny - even for European standards.
9,779,"Sep 24 2007 	Guesthouse West is the Best	The purpose of our stay was for some much needed relaxation time after afew very stressful months.We chose the Guesthouse West for its location, quality and ambience and we were not disappointed, infact the hotel exceeded our expectations.From check-in to check-out we experienced nothing but helpful, friendly and polite staff. The whole experience was hassle free and very relaxing.Clean, tidy, quiet, relaxing...everything we needed.I would recommend Guesthouse west to anyone who wants to enjoy London in a location that is superb but away from the general noise and maddness."
10,779,"Sep 19 2007 	quiet friendly and an enjoyable stay	We stayed here to celebrate my husbands birthday, we live in the in the quiet quaint west country and thought London would be noisey whereever you stay - but here, it was quiet, friendly and location wise was perfect. We enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the west end and then returned to our relaxing hotel room at night. We booked the larger of the two rooms types they have, worth the money and are located at back of hotel so hence the peace and quiet! we will definately come back!"
11,779,"Sep 3 2007 	Teeny weeny room great big price!	I live around the corner from Guesthouse West and have frequently recommended it to out-of-town friends. Never again. I just stayed for two nights myself while builders took over my house. If you want to know what it was like, imagine climbing into a small cardboard box and tearing up 20 notes.The room was so small there was barely room to squeeze between the bed and the walls. The breakfast was this bleak little collection of cereals perched on the hotel bar, particularly disappointing when you know there are great places like Ottolenghi and 206 just around the corner. But the real shocker was the price. 160 per night! You have got to be joking! I don't care if this is in trendy Notting Hill, it's an utter rip-off, even by London's standards. The staff had that strained feel that people get when they have to field constant complaints. When I told them I thought that the prices were out of whack with reality by a factor of two, they kept their cool, but I got the sense that they had heard it all before and that, frankly, they agreed. Avoid at all costs. Or, failing that, sleep in a doorway. In any case, save your money to spend on something that won't have you feeling like you just slept in a cupboard and then had your wallet stolen."
12,779,"Mar 18 2007 	Too Close for Comfort	Our room was so small, I didn't know a hotel room could be so small. The bathroom was even worse, too small to turn around in. there wasn't enough space to put clothes away in drawers or to hang them up. A small refrigerator in the room would have been nice, if there had been room. We asked the hotel to order us a taxi to drive us to dinner and they ordered a minicab instead of a metered taxi and the minicab overcharged us by 10 pounds. The hotel was barely apologetic. No elevators and the hotel staffed complained as they brought our bags to our room. Don't stay here!"
13,779,"Feb 13 2007 	Perfectly formed chic location great experience	Really enjoyed our stay at this really perfectly located hotel. Was over to London on business and my wife came with me for a shoppign trip in Notting Hill. Found the staff really helpful - they went out of thier way to help and make our trip to London fun packed and easy. the rooms were fine, great showers, and modern, the breakfast was excellent. Look forward to coming back in the summer! Comfy beds and great linen."
14,779,"Feb 6 2007	Small and perfectly formed	Stayed here last summer and again over christmas. GHW is in the perfect location for just about every escapade in London. Central enough that travel around town isn't a chore and far enough away to enjoy a drink (great little bar) on the terrace in the sun without a lungfull of traffic. Also loads to do on the doorstep, great restaurants and bars and plenty of amazing boutiques to help you part with your cash. The room I stayed in, although not cavernous, was definitely not too small. It definitely was clean, everything worked, storage was ample, the bed incredibly comfortable and the decor calm and sophisticated. Staff are great, down to earth and welcoming. I would definitely go back and hope to soon."
15,779,"Oct 1 2006 	pretentious and not worth the money	I was expecting something far more stylish. i found the place quite disappointing and by standard more like a youth hostel than a &quot;design B&amp;B&quot;. Tiny, tiny rooms, no adequate lightning in the bathroom to put on any make up. The full size mirror was on the inside of the bathroom door, which automatically slammed shut. i had to stuff magazines under the door in order to get a view of myself after getting dressed..which again ment i could't open the cupboard (flattery for the 50 cm wide box for clothing), because the bathroom door was blocking it...could't figure out the tv (maybe just me...). but the breakfast was the biggest joke: the roomprice includes &quot;continental breakfast&quot;- which in their opinon seems to be toast, 3 pakets of cornflakes and some yogurt. service was also quite bad, the eastern european staff was obviously untrained in service or hotelbusiness. the hotel is part owned by private investors, they have an interesting business model where you can buy a room and they rent i out for you. if i was an investor, i would be dead worried."
16,779,"Sep 11 2006 	More style than substance	Guesthouse West was a very disappointing experience. Long tortuous corridors and narrow stairs, a nightmare for the less-able. Cold, no choice breakfast in an uncomfortable bar area, cramped rooms, no room service and a general take-it-or-leave-it attitude... I'm afraid the stylish decor doesn't hide the old 'very little for a lot' management philosophy."
17,779,"Apr 23 2006	Enjoyed This Place	I have to admit, I'm surprised by the negative reviews. I really enjoyed my two night stay at the GuestHouse West. If you travel around Europe, you know smallish rooms are the standard not the exception. I found my rooms to be well-sized. Yes, rooms plural. The first night I was upstairs. The next morning they called to inform me that a guest was leaving early and that I could be upgraded to a larger room off the patio if I liked. No charge. Again, both were lovely rooms. Good thread count on the bed linens. Heavy well-knit blankets and throws. One day it was hot and sunny and the next day it rained. The heating and air conditioning were excellent and strong on both days. There was no room service which was disappointing, but the bar/cafe downstairs was fine when in a pinch, although a tad overpriced. But why would you eat there when the loviest tea house around - the awesome, lavendar-hued Tea Palace - was literally steps away up the quiet, tree-lined street. Or the awesome Notting Hill market with everything from chocolate covered strawberries to hand-made beads. All of the local directions and detailed maps to other London locations were politely offered by the staff. I am a 32-year old woman who was travelling alone and it was my first time in London and I loved this place. Will go again..."
18,779,"Apr 23 2006	Hidden great little boutique hotel	Me and mum just arrived home in New York!And we can't forget what we have found!In the heart of notting hill-Guesthouse West.What a found!When we checked in,the rooms are just comfortable size, we wanted a big room and they have accommodate us with a bigger room with a skylight in the middle of the room, patio doors to the back terrace of the hotel.The room is very nice.The bed linen were so soft and we slept like a babies.The rooms are in good condtion, with molton brown toiletrees which suits us just fine cos its our favourite.Also free wireless acces,dvd and cd players in the room which was just fab for me because I could work and play.The food absolutely tasty.The staff are very accommodating and very friendly.Its good to see everyone greeting you with smiles,they don't have porter service but our heavy luggage was carried by the barstaff and the chef happening to be in reception to give us a hand.The location is great and we were shopping like crazy and the surrounding restaurants were great!It was like a second home for us,the door is 24hrs open and you can come and go as you like.So me and my mum had great fun.Thank you for a great stay, we will def be back:-)"
19,779,"Apr 4 2006 	A Disappointment in Notting Hill	I will not stay at Guesthouse West again. This is not a charming B&amp;B. It is a budget operation with minimal service that tries to mask itself as otherwise.The room, even by European standards, was tiny. The service was borderline rude, full of attitude and worst of all, quite lax. When I asked for an early evening wake-up call (sleeping off jet lag) I never received one, nearly causing me to miss an important meeting. After that, I didn't trust them to bring a fresh towel. The breakfast is ok, hardly worth the price. Go to Tom's deli, just down the road, for great eggs and juice. Plus they're polite."
20,779,"Jan 15 2006	Nice place - shame about the staff	No smile from any staff except the waitress. The Receptionist was bordering upon being positively surly and whilst we were in our room someone came bursting in using a pass key (not the cleaning staff) and there was no knock, no apology nothing. The barman in the evening, was really a joke. He made it clear that he thought we were a nuisance drinking in there!! Was really rude to one man, and when I asked for a cocktail was told I couldn't have one!!! The main was of Asian (possibly Chinese origin) for the owners if they read this [no other way of describing him, he didn't have a name badge on]. It was apalling, we'd gone in for a nightcap after a night out and it really put a downer on things :(The room was upgraded to one at the front (as they were fairly empty I think) but even that was very small. It was comfortable, but there was no information given either at reception on where to go for breakfast, what the times were, where to go for the in-house DVD library. We had to wander round and find out for ourselves. No information about the surrounding area, what to do either verbally or in print.Nice place, nicely situated, but REALLY disappointing due to the very unwelcoming demeanour of staff (except the waitress in the morning). I won't go there again unless they do some serious people-management training!"
21,779,"Nov 22 2005 	Guesthouse West is great	I stayed at Guesthouse West last month and I thought it was great. I would agree that the rooms are a litle small but that's Notting Hill, especially for 145 for a double room and breakfast. I used to live in Notting Hill and my flat was very small for the money I paid for it!The main thing I liked is that the staff are very relaxed and friendly and really try to help wherever they can. It doesn't have a spa but there is a great one up the road called urban Spa where guests get a discount - worth having! Like the rooms, I also thought the bar area had a cool and calm feel to it, and a great terrace. Anyway - I would definitely recommend staying there if you need to overnight in London."
22,779,"Nov 20 2005 	Nice staff comfortable stylish and well located hotel	I made a last-minute booking to stay at this hotel after a flight was delayed and I missed my sleeper train up to Scotland. I found the Slovak night manager very accommodating - he even made me hot chocolate after the bar had closed. The rooms are quite small, but very comfortable. It felt luxurious to me (I'm not a seasoned business traveller however!).The Wireless Internet access was crucial to me, as I needed to book a replacement flight for the next day, and I had no problems logging on.In the morning, I got up and enjoyed a light breakfast in the bar area with a paper, and went on my merry way. Compared with other hotels of this standard, I believe the price was quite good, especially as breakfast and my late night hot chocolate were included. It was also very useful that the hotel is walking distance from Paddington from where the Heathrow Express takes you to the airport (this was actually my main reason for going to the hotel in the first place)."
23,779,"Oct 10 2005	First time and last time!	We were there last July for two nights. We had this room facing the street on the second floor...Room was super tiny, I could almost jump from the bed to the bathroom area...No fridge, no place to hang some clothes...Bed was very comfy, but the crochet blanket was torn...The desk area was a dusty...the worst part was that someone had forgotten to flush the toilet before we checked in/wasn't cleaned properly and whenever i flushed, things kept coming back...MAJOR EEEW!!! I complaint to the front desk, all she said was &quot;I'm so sorry...&quot;There's no elevetor in that hotel..so we had to drag our big luggage by ourselves through the stairs...The lobby is kinda cute, cool boutique-style...Staff were not friendly and not helpful at all...The only good thing about this hotel is the location...but for a 160 pound/night standard room (without breakfast)? I dont think it's worth it...I think you can find a much better one...I would especially make a point that this hotel doesnt meet the &quot;boutique&quot; standard because of its cleanliness and staff friendliness..."
24,779,"Aug 22 2005 	not so great	the price is cheap for london but if you are looking forward to staying in a chic guesthouse, forget it. the rooms are cheaply done and already a bit rundown, especially the bathroom. i would never want to stay there again."
25,779,"Aug 8 2005	Not Nice Enough for the Price	Guesthouse West looks great on the website, but in reality the rooms are very small and bland--for the price, there was hardly any room to turn around once my luggage was in the room. The TV and bathroom were nice, but the bed was uncomfortable. On the plus side, it is situated in a great neighborhood and a 10 minute tube ride to central London."
26,779,"Jun 9 2005	Beware of ""Design Hotel"" in Notting Hill!	Here we have a hotel which looked cool from the outside, despite the decked area in front always being empty...We booked a room which was tiny, facing the noisy street. Someone had smoked in the room and it smelled like a 15$ hotel at a railway station.The ashtray had been emptied in the toilet and someone had forgotten to flush. Really nice.The remote to the TV did not work and the staff treated me like an idiot bothering them about this &quot;are you sure you have turned on the TV...&quot;?-Yes, I am... The batteries in the remote are probably dead, I suggested.I was brought TWO new remotes and the whole arrangement was so complicated I lost all interest in the TV and DVD.After these two episodes we managed to change room, to another tiny one facing the back of the house.The only problems now were the AC-unit-ventliation outside the window that was noisy and some kind of fan that started in the ventilation every now and then...The bathroom felt like it had never been cleaned properly, tiles were falling off from round the drainage, a damp water-damaged feeling lingered in the place.Great for ?160. Beware!!!!"
27,779,"Apr 8 2005	Standards slipping?	I was really looking forward to staying at this hotel after the reviews I read on this website. On arrival, the receptionist was not that friendly/helpful. We ended up having a drink in the lounge before we went out - the barman was very charming and professional and he made us 2 wonderful cocktails.The room was ok - however TV control batteries were low so we were unable to work the tv properly. We were also woken up around 2 am by what sounded like another bed being used quite adventurously by another couple right in the room above ours. The noise was quite loud so obviously the rooms aren't well sound-proofed! When I sampled the continental breakfast the following morning, I was really irritated to find that my croissant was hard and stale. So I decided to forgo it and went to reception to pay. I had to wait another 10 minutes before the receptionist came back.All in all, very disappointing - it could be a great place if staff were more accommodating, more attention to detail were paid to the rooms and finally if the breakfasts were more interesting. I felt it was actually not worth the price."
28,779,"Jan 14 2005	Nice design. But loose service.	Stayed for 2 nights in December. Rooms are beautiful. Small, but set up in a very clever and sophisticated design. Bathroom is even smaller. I wouldnt never close the door. Loved the brown wood interior especially the table. Technical Equipment is nice as well. Flat Screen, DVD Player, DigiCable, Phone... I'd go stay again for the design. But...Staff was mostly friendly (with one exception of a receptionist who forgot to order my scheduled taxi which almost caused me to miss my flight... and then even had an attitude about it...)breakfast is lame... lamer...lamest. Tried it twice and all they had on the quickly set up bar table was toast and jam. And bad coffee. Wireless internet cut out all the time. They didnt know why.For the proud room price I'd expect a more functional equipment+service. But as I said, design is a pleasure.(As I heard, the hotel is under new management since early 2004... the actual design is not originated by the actual GuestHouseWest... so the definition should be: great hotel, bad management)"
29,779,"Nov 24 2004	So-so experience	I've stayed at plenty of Design Hotels and expected this one to be better. The building feels like an old 70s-era hostel, and the rooms are tiny, not exactly fresh and certainly not new. Beds were comfortable and duvets nice additions, but the room wasn't quite as luxe as i expected. Location is fantastic though, and staff were helpful."
30,779,"Oct 8 2004	Water problem	We had reserved a room here on October 1, but after completing our check in, were told that the water pressure was &quot;low&quot; due to a water main break. Upon further inquiry, we discovered that there was no water at all in the hotel. The reservation clerk seemed quite surprised when we told her that we could not stay under these circumstances. We wondered why she had not mentioned the problem before we completed the check in."
31,779,"Oct 5 2004	Warm 	Five terrific nights at The Guesthouse West/ Nottinghill. The staff could not have been more helpful. The location was perfect for the Saturday Portobelo Road Market. The linens were top grade...however, the down comforter could have been larger. Not big enough for two people in one queen bed. Although, the rooms and bathrooms are small for two people. The breakfasts were quite nice. Will definitely recommend this hotel!!!"
32,779,"Oct 3 2004	Good Start	We stayed at Guesthouse West for 3 nights in early September 2004. After a 24 hour flight to the UK. we were very happy to arrive at the hotel at 7:30am and for a room to be ready for us! We had a stardard double room that overlooked Westbourne Grove. The room was quite small, but very clean and recently renovated. The colour scheme was dominated by chocolate, steel and white and there was a generous use of timber. The bathroom was clean and included a large shower rather than a bath (which was great). The staff were friendly and helpful although there was some confusion over the bill on departure (was breakfast included or not included??). Overall, we would recommend this hotel."
33,779,"Jul 22 2004	stunning	My old friend and i stayed in the hotel for a girly get together, we were blown over by this rather last minuit booking. This is a truly stunning design hotel! All mod-cons inclusive and located in the grand and upcoming notting hill. Not only are the staff friendly and attentive, the hotels chic restaurant, bar and outside decking exceed all hotels I have visited yet. What a fantastic weekend! I encourage anyone and everyone in London to take a look!"
34,779,"Jul 21 2004	What a find!!	Feel like I have to write a review of this place because it was so lovely! Its a design hotel so its really gorgeous inside, but in a cosy way and its totally non pretentious. All the staff seemed to really care ifyou had a good time or not! It also has a massive terrace at the front where you can chill on. I was on my own and didnt feel at all stupid. Only downside is that the rooms are a bit small, but its about the same price as the hilton and is so much more homely and welcoming. Wont be going anywhere else again! X"
1,788,"Great locationwhat a find highly recommendgreat value	We are so pleased we found this gem,easy access to transport bus stop right outside. Rooms great and housekeeping 5 star. Breakfast would be the best you will get with such a good choice. Staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble.We stayed 5 days and it was always nice to come back at the end of busy day. We will be back"
2,788,"This is my kind of hotel	This hotel was exactly what I was looking for, nice, clean, in a super central location in London. I liked my room which was on the first floor, a lot. Warm water in the shower, toilet working all the time. I didn't need to carry my quite big luggage up or down the stairs (please note that this hotel does not have an elevator!). Breakfast was very nice. Everyone I met from the staff was very friendly.I will stay here again on future visits to London."
3,788,"Nov 8 2009 	Great location confortable room!	We were at Hart House Hotel for 5 nights in sep/09. The hotel is in a really good location, next to Baker Street, with a lot of restaurants and a nice pub nearby: The Globe. The room is huge and very clean. You will find a really confortable bed after a long day of sightseeing.The breakfast is good. They offer orange juice, coffee, tea, some toasts with butter, and a choice of something from the menu: bacon, sausages, eggs (scrambled, boiled...). It was good, but after 5 mornings we could have something different!Internet is not free, but really cheap, 5 pounds during your stay.The staff is just ok... when we asked Dana from the reception desk about directions, she actually said us to go look on google maps!!!"
4,788,"Oct 26 2009 	what a hidden Gem	This Hotel is lovely and excellent value for money. I booked a Double room, which was spacious, exceptionally clean and had everything you needed for a comfortable stay. The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating which you don't find often these days. Breakfast is served in small dinning room with a great choice from a full cooked English to Fruit and some great pastries. Would certainly recommend and will definitely use again."
5,788,"Sep 25 2009 	A Disappointment	Their website looked so good, and the reviews on Trip Advisor weren't bad, so I thought I would go for it. But it was a big disappointment. Very old style London B&amp;B. On arriving, we were given our keys and pointed upwards - no offer to help with bags, no 'welcome to London' - nothing. And those stairs! We had a twin room on the 2nd floor and as all you Trip Advisor readers know, in London that means on the 3rd floor so there were about 50 steps to negotiate with luggage (no lift). And to make matters worse, the breakfast room and reception were in the basement so another 16 steps to so. The hotel was on a VERY noisy street so you couldn't have the windows open - a fan was provided but it was very loud and you had to place it on the only chair in the room in order to cool the room. Breakfast was good though, although service again was not the best. PS - they charge extra if you pay with a credit card."
6,788,"Jul 20 2009 	great hotel in a great location	I stayed at this hotel for 1 night in a twin room. The room was small but clean and quite modern as was the bathroom which was also small, The weather was incredibly warm the night we stayed and an air conditioning unit had been placed in the room which was needed and appreciated. The breakfast room was quite small and felt a little bit cramped but i am used to staying in larger hotels. I left my mobile telephone charger in the room and on contacting the hotel they posted it back to me free of charge. I think this is an ideal hotel close to oxford street and within easy reach of wembley by tube. I would definately recomend this hotel to anyone needing a hotel for a couple of nights."
7,788,Jun 19 2009 	Great Location	Hart House is a cross between a B&amp;B and small hotel. We got heir details from a AA Motoring B&amp;B book. The hotel is in a great location a 5 minute walk to terrific Oxford St and surrounds. We found the room very comfortable but a bit cozy considering we had 4 of us in the room but clean and comfortable. The breakfast is great with the ladies cooking your breakkfast fresh as you order it.No complaint other than the fact that it fairly pricey but thats London.
8,788,"May 21 2009 	Best value in Marylebone	My second trip. Andrew and Dana are most cordial &amp; helpful and make everyone feel at home. The breakfast is super, especially the sausages. My room was on the top floor, so I got good exercise. Appointments &amp; toiletries just perfect.Wifi at L5 per visit much valued - other hotels want 12 or 15 pounds/day.Several buses stop 50 meters away. So getting elsewhere in London no problem. Good variety of eateries within short walk.I will surely return again."
9,788,"Apr 23 2009 	A nice friendly place to stay in London	My family recently stayed here for 5 days. We had 2 rooms. The breakfast was great each morning and the staff was extremely helpful. Dana was great! The neighborhood was safe and nice. Lots of places to eat nearby. The beds were very comfortable, and we slept soundly."
10,788,"Mar 29 2009 	Central London clean and comfortable	Hart House is everything a good B&amp;B should be - great location, comfortable, very clean and with friendly hosts.Not sure why it's classed as a hotel, when it's only a B&amp;B, but apart from that and the many stairs to climb to my room, I couldn't fault it. Will definitely be staying again when in London."
11,788,"Mar 25 2009 	Good value; friendly staff.	Just got back from a trip to London and enjoyed my stay at the Hart House Hotel. Very friendly staff and clean, comfortable rooms. Great location - in a quiet area that has a residential feel but still only a short walk to busy Oxford street. Would stay here again!"
12,788,"Nov 6 2008 	Delightful Respite	Hart House Hotel provided a delightful respite during our October visit to the London area. Our flight into LHR was significantly delayed, yet we were cheerfully greeted by Dana when we arrived at the hotel's doors after 10pm in the evening. We were ushered to a quiet, immaculate, pleasantly decorated, twin-bedded room with more than adequate space and facilities. There seem to be dozens of hotels in the area, running the range of price and amenities, but we highly recommend Hart House. Hotel employees are extremely helpful. We were treated with utmost courtesy and folks went out of their way to accommodate our stay. There is a &quot;free&quot; daily breakfast. One need not tote a PC as a computer is available for use by guests. For travellers with significant baggage or ambulatory issues, request a room on the first floor as an elevator is not available -- and would not, in any case, harmonize well with the boutique-style of the hotel. Further, if arriving at LHR, we recommend that one take the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station and a cab from there to Gloucester Place (Forget about going to Baker Street station). The hotel is located &quot;in the heart of London's West End&quot; (City of Westminster), with ready access to most traveller's needs within short walking distances; as are many of greater London's attractions (including Buckingham Palace). Pick up frequent city tours leaving Baker Street station. Owner/Manager Andrew readily dispenses helpful tourist advise. A great place! We look forward to a future stay. ~Richard &amp; Mae"
13,788,"Oct 5 2008 	Clean cute and good locale	After taking the Heathrow Connect to Baker St (as instructed by the Hart House website), it was a somewhat confusing walk with our luggage in tow to the Hart House. Once in, however, we were pleasantly surprised by the clean, fresh appearance of our room. We stayed at the back of the hotel so were not exposed to the street noise. The bathroom was ok - as expected in the UK.After settling in, we were only a short walk to Oxford St. Indeed, the Hart House is a great location for accessing much of what London has to offer.We found the staff outwardly polite, but short at times, like we were imposing on their time. They offered a pretty good breakfast. One thing though - on our final night our sleep was interrupted in the morning by early arriving (departing?) guests who showed no consideration as they slammed doors and stomped about. Hardly the fault of the staff at Hart House. However, it reflects the intimate nature of the small premises"
14,788,"Sep 22 2008 	The Greatest Beds in Europe!	Our family of six (which included two 20-year-old girls, a 16-year-old boy and a 13-year old daughter) had two triple rooms at Hart House Hotel. Two months later, we're still talking wistfully about those beds! They are wonderful! Our group had two triple rooms. We were prepared for a long climb to third-floor rooms (as warned in other reviews). Instead, we were pleasantly surprised to have two first-floor triple rooms. The rooms were pleasant with high ceilings and ample space for three to move around. We didn't have air conditioning, but the rooms were pre-equipped with fans. Frankly, even in July, London's weather was cool enough that we didn't even need them.  The location is great and the neighborhood has charm. The hop-on-hop-off bus even goes down the street passing the hotel with commentary on the history of the street's buildings. Everything is in easy walking distance. We never felt unsafe, and we walked in the neighborhood day and even late at night. After we learned the lay of the land, we allowed our teenagers to walk around together without us and they were fine. Staff was pleasant and very efficient. We are also the type to throw our luggage in a room and to be out sightseeing day and night. At first, we had difficulty getting directions from desk staff since the (very nice) woman working the desk wasn't English and there was a language barrier. She didn't know common landmarks and sites, so couldn't give us a hint on which direction to go. We ended up grabbing a couple maps and finding our way everywhere, so it wasn't a big deal. On the other hand, when we needed something, she (and other staff) were extremely efficient and responded immediately. We would definately stay here again and recommend it highly. It's a pleasant and cozy surprise in busy London!"
15,788,"Jan 4 2008 	Good value for London	Stayed overnight in this hotel located in Marylebone (roughly between Baker Street and Oxford Street). I had a single room and expected the worst. You have to ring the door bell and wait for someone to come to the door to open it for you. Someone came promptly and asked who I was and went to get the key. I was then told how to get to my room.I was pleasantly surprised. There were 3 flights of stairs to the room so I would not recommend you go there with heavy luggage but the room was quite large for a single room. The bed was what I would call a small double, there was a wardrobe, desk/make up table, a stool for the desk and an armchair. There was a small kettle to make tea/coffee. The small ensuite bathroom had no natural light but was good enough for an overnight stay. It has a small shower, loo and washbasin. Towels were nice and fluffy. Everything was immaculately clean.Breakfast was in the basement. Tables were already laid with plates/cutlery and orange juice. You could help yourself to the usual range of cereals and some fresh fruits. A range of cooked breakfast was available (the scrambled eggs and toast I had were fine) and there was jam and marmelade at the table. The staff were pleasant throughout. The ony problem I had was with the road noise - my room was overlooking the main road - I guess it is difficult to get away from road noise in London! So if you want peace and quiet, I would recommend you ask for a room at the back."
16,788,"Jan 3 2008 	Great Bed and Breakfast!	Just got back from a very nice vacation in London. I've never written a review before, but after our stay at the Hart House Hotel I felt it would be wrong to not write a review of such a great Hotel like the Hart House hotel. We're a family of five, with three teenagers. We're the type of family that sleeps, eats breakfast and then goes out all day. The Hart House Hotel was perfect for us. It's a beautiful Georgian B&amp;B that makes you feel very comfortable. Our room was large enough to accomodate all of us. Extremely clean and the beds were very comfortable. Room had a television and two outlets for charging up the cell phones and cameras. Bathroom was on small side but sufficient for our use. The English breakfast was great! Sausages, bacon, eggs, plenty of toast, orange juice, cereal, fruit, coffee, and tea. The staff was very helpful, pleasant, and always had a smile for us. Dana was extremely helpful with directions, advice, and taxi reservations. The room rate was within our budget and worth every pence. I highly recommend Hart House to all. G'day, Mate!"
17,788,"Jan 2 2008	very nice hotel	We are a family of four (two older children) and stayed at the Hart House for four days total with an initial three days and then returning for a day. Overall, we had a very good experience. We started with a triple and rollaway in Room 1 and, while it was quite close quarters, the room was clean and nice. Our last day, we stayed in the infamous rooms at the top (15 and 16). It is definitely a hike (and you will not want to carry up heavy luggage) but the rooms are quite nice and very pleasant. We enjoyed them. There are a lot of stairs but you can chalk it up to increasing your fitness. It would not be good for someone elderly or with physical limitations so make that clear when you book-I'm sure the staff will try to accomodate)/ Breakfast was very good (not extraordinary-but quite fine). Please note re: expectations that no one is going to carry your luggage and provide a high level of extra service. The hotel provides a cleanvery nice room in a good location at good value and breakfast. If you want higher levels of service or attentiveness (or you have physical limitations re: stairs and such) this is not the place for you.We would definitely stay here again and recommend it."
18,788,"Dec 18 2007 	A pleasant surprise in London	We stayed here mid December for 2 nights for our Christmas trip to London. Friendly and helpful staff, lovely breakfast, clean and spacious room. We booked a triple room - there was a double and a single bed, plenty of room for the three of us. The hotel is a short walk from both Baker Street and Oxford Street and the bus to Kings Cross leaves from right outside. The area seems safe although we weren't out too late because of our little girl. Although it seems expensive, comparatively it is good value. I would highly recommend this hotel."
19,788,"Nov 23 2007 	Stairs were a killer!	Stayed here from November 10-18th, 2007. Good things - 2 tube stations close by. Helpful staff. Clean rooms. Ensuite (tiny, but have had worse).Bad things - We were in room 16, straight at the very top. No elevator. Those stairs were a killer. We'd suggest asking for a room on the lower levels. We had a hard time regulating the temp in the room - too hot, too cold. The wall between us and the next room seemed pretty thin - the tv was mounted on the other side of the wall behind our headboards. Hard to ignore the tv being on until 4am in the next room. That only happened one night.We would recommend Hart House to friends - and only room #16 if they're in really good shape!"
20,788,"Aug 28 2007 	wonderful place for a family	We took our 2 young children to London in May 2007, and booked a family room through their internet site and was pleasantly surprised. The room had 2 twins and 1 double bed, a very high ceiling, and a bathtub. The kids loved it. The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was super! It was nice having choices every morning for the little ones. We found the staff and regular guests to be very friendly and nice. It was a wonderful place to stay!"
21,788,"Aug 22 2007 	Clean and neat	My husband and I stayed here in February. This hotel is very clean, with a terrific breakfast, the Cumberland sausage, yum! The bathroom was large compaired with the usual cramped quarters of typical European hotels. It is centrally located close to bus and tube stations. The only drawback is that the staff was not very helpful in giving directions. We asked how to find for example Harrods dept store and we were directed to a map. We even asked if someone could point us in the right direction to walk to the tube station and again we were directed to the map. Other wise we had a fine time."
22,788,"Aug 19 2007	A keeper	While it is a little scary that $220.00 a night is now considered budget level in London--I suppose I am too old or have been traveling too long--this is a wonderful place to stay. We arrived at 8 AM extremely tired from an all night train ride with a crying baby in the next compartment and were told, very courteously, that unfortunately we wouldn't be able to have our room for several hours. But when the receptionist saw the very sad looks on our faces she thought for a moment, went and talked to somebody, and we were taken upstairs immediately and given a wonderful room opening onto the street, with a balcony. Yes, the room was not huge, but it was airy and immaculately clean and we were very happy there. Also, the breakfast was excellent, and this is not a given at London hotels--fresh first-rate croissants and pain au chocolat, lots of fresh fruit, very good eggs etc, served by a warm and helpful staff."
23,788,"Aug 6 2007 	Perfect location for a London visit	We stayed 4 nights at Hart House, and if it were up to our children, we would have spent the remainder of our England trip there as well! The rooms were indeed small, but then again, this is London - small rooms are the norm in other large cities (we've stayed in smaller rooms in NYC and Paris). Everything was clean and neat, the linens were first rate. The staff was always friendly and helpful - the guests at times were the surly ones.This was an excellent base for walking to Regent's Park, Baker Street, Hyde Park and Oxford Street. The tube was a few blocks walk to Marble Arch, where we grabbed a double decker tour bus ride and the tube to everywhere else. There were so many wonderful restaurants in the area, it was difficult to choose. Breakfast was included at the hotel, and though simple, was just what we needed to start the day.Our trip was only a few months ago, and we already want to go back!"
24,788,"Jul 6 2007 	Fantastic hotel and very helpful staff	We booked the hotel as our first stop on a European trip for 2 nights. Since our arrival from the United States got us to the hotel in the late morning before check in time, the staff worked hard to get us into our rooms with minimal delay. They were also very accomadating with a special request that I had since the day of arrival was our 24th wedding anniversary. The hotel is in a great location for a number of different attractions and also easy to access with a 5 minute walk to 2 tube stations. Everyone we talked to at the hotel, whether it was the staff or the owner were Very Helpful with suggestions regarding sites to see, theatre tickets and pubs to eat at ( try the Globe Pub ). We were travelling with our two children ages 15 and 18 and they were able to get 2 rooms for us located right next to each other on the top floor. There is no lift so if you have trouble with alot of stairs ask for a lower level room.This was our 5th trip to Europe and the Hart House is one of our favorite hotels that we have stayed at, we will be returning to the hotel the next time we are in London."
25,788,"Jun 20 2007 	Highly Recommended	This was my first stay at the Hart House Hotel.I found details about the hotel on the web and decided to contact them directly by e-mail to see what rates they woud be able to offer me. Dana replied promptly, to which I telephoned the Hotel to confirmmy booking with a Credit Card number.I am female and was travelling alone to London and staying just the one night, as I was attending a work function in another London hotel.The hotel is located a short walk from Oxford Street. However, as I was attending a 'Black Tie' evening, I required a taxi. Black Cab Taxis were readily available passing the front door, which was great!I found the Hotel to be ideally suited to my needs. The staff were very pleasant and helpful with any enquiry. The room was clean and very well maintained. The breakfast was great, a selection of cerealsand fruit, cooked breakfast (which was cooked fresh to order), toast and plenty of tea.There is no doubt in my mind that I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London. I will be sure to stay nect time I have the opportunity to visit the great city again."
26,788,May 14 2007 	Delicious breakfast	Superb location for Madame Tussauds and Oxford Street. Excellent shopping nearby and lots of restaurants.The room was a bit on the small side but clean and comfortable and service in general was excellent. Would definitely recommend.
27,788,"Jan 15 2007 	No crab-apples allowed! This is a wonderful little boutique hotel	We really enjoyed our stay at the Hart House, brief as it was (one night on our way home from Paris). There were four of us traveling and, although we had originally booked two twin rooms, after a week of sharing a small flat in Paris, we all wanted to spread out!!! The staff gave us different room types (the two original twin rooms and two singles). While the single I stayed in is indeed small, it was spotless and kind of cute! The linens were fresh, soft and comforting. My room faced the street and it was not at all a problem; a little bit of traffic, but still I felt safe. My friends had rooms on different floors, and I got a chance to note that the rooms were beautifully kept. I am VERY picky! These rooms all passed muster. I did call to the front desk before bedtime to ask if they could ask my neighbor to turn down the very loud TV. In a matter of a minute, there was peace and quiet. The rooms were affordable for this part of London, and the only reason I would stay somewhere else is if that place were more convenient to what I was visiting in London. It is in a great location with many cafes and shopping opportunities (Oxford Street!)"
28,788,"Dec 5 2006 	So-so	My wife and I stayed at the Hart House Hotel in September. The rooms were nice and well kept and the breakfast is what you would expect from a continental breakfast. The only complaint we had was the staff which we had read on TripAdvisor before we left. The staff is not very accommodating when it comes to questions regarding directions or general politeness. They act as though it is a hassle any time you ask them something and when you want to use their internet connection to communicate with friends and family. In our travels to London and Paris, we actually found the Londoners to be more rude towards tourists and Americans in general. Not a bad place to lay your head but we would probably find another place next time."
29,788,"Oct 18 2006 	Well Kept Secret... Fantastic Value	I had the pleasure of staying at the Hart House for 4 nights in mid September 2006 and, given the cost of accomodation in London, found the hotel in general and our room specifically to be more than we could have asked for. I had booked a twin room as I was travelling with my brother, and Mr. Bowden graciously gave us a three-bed family room for the twin rate. As one would expect, the ground floor room was more than spacious with a generously sized bathroom.Being of Polish background, we got along famously with the staff at the hotel and Mr. Bowden was, as could be expected from an Englishman, very courteous and helpful.I am not a fussy traveller, I do not expect to waited on hand and foot like some who have posted reviews of this and other hotels on this web site, and as such I can honestly say I could not find fault with any aspect of our stay here. Once we explored the area a little we easily found a wealth of restaurants and a Sri Lankan grocer just a block away that was open until midnight for sundries such as newspapers, bottled water and fresh fruit, as well as a dry cleaners who delivered our laundry back to the hotel the nexy day.The hotel's proximity to Oxford/Bond Streets, as well as Hyde Park make it an ideal base to explore London, and I can safely say that barring any inheritance or lottery winnings in the near future I will most definitely stay at the Hart House Hotel on my next trip to London."
30,788,"Oct 3 2006	Stay away from the Hart Hotel	Though supposedly a reasonably priced room for London, we still didn't get what we paid for. The people behind the reception desk were very unfriendly and expressed resentment when you asked them simple questions - like - what time do the museums open? what time do the stores open? They were very uncertain about all of this. If you asked them for a phone number of a specific place they had you go look it up yourself. What was said to me was -How should I know that? When I suggested they look it up on their computer, I was told to look it up myself in the yellow pages. It wasn't that other people were waiting in line to be helped. I was the only one there. They were not there to provide any sort of service!The room we had was ultra small and drab. It was definitely not a place to spend time in or feel good on one's return back. Usually there was noone at the reception desk in the afternoon, but the hotel hires many people from Eastern Europe who they hire as kitchen help and maids. They are very friendly, tho most have recently arrived to London and don't know much about it or the transportation system.The Marylebone area is very wonderful and Marylebone High Street is a great place to stroll and grab a bite."
31,788,"Sep 3 2006	most enjoyable time	Dear Hart House Hotel, We wish to pass along our appreciation from our pleasant stay with you in June of this summer. We had a most enjoyable time and in particular at breakfast. Please extend our highest regards to your staff, who so kindly looked after our comfort. We enjoyed talking with the ladies at breakfast and in the evenings, inquiring for help and directions or talking about our adventures in London. They are such pleasant folks! We were able to see all of the London attractions on our list and enjoyed fine weather the whole time we were there. Unfortunately we weren't able to cheer England on to the World Cup Finals, however it was fun enjoying the early rounds up street at the local pubs. We will gladly recommend your hotel to our friends visiting London in the near future, and look forward to returning some day soon ourselves. Kind regards, Guests From Houston, TX USA"
32,788,"Jun 8 2006	Great accommodations for the price	Three of us stayed 7 nights at the Hart House Hotel in September, 2005. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were small but clean, comfortable and very good service. The breakfast (included in the rate) was excellent - full British breakfast including eggs, sausage, cereal, croissant, fruit. Our rooms (one single and one double) faced on the street and if you sleep with windows open it can get noisy from the traffic. Easy access to bus and underground. Would absolutely stay here again."
33,788,"Feb 13 2006	Loved our stay Again!	We recently stayed with Hart House Hotel and we received excellent service! When we arrived in the early morning of February 1 we were allowed immediate access to our room, which made a huge difference on our first day after traveling all night. And since we had to leave early on February 3, the staff prepared a breakfast tray for us the night before, which again made a difference in how our travel went.  We had stayed with Hart House previously, in January 1999, actually in the same room! The hotel has only improved over the seven years. We plan to return next year and would like to stay with Hart House again! Sam and Paula"
34,788,"Jan 3 2006	Horrible service	We stayed at the Hart House Hotel for a week in December, we were constantly treated rude by staff and when we complained several times about extremely loud banging above us the staff did NOTHING to try to help. The area is a good starting point in order to take a taxi to various sights, but as far as the area around the hotel it really isnt all that great. I agree with the other reviewers who said the sheets were way past dated, that the breakfast was nothing to write home about, and the shower was too small. I would not suggest staying here unless you were absolutely desperate for a room!"
35,788,"Jan 1 2006	OK but bring ear plugs	We stayed at the Hart House for four days in late December 2005. We were in room 16 on the top floor. By the time we left our legs were in better shape than we started from all the stair climbing. This B&amp;B is clean, our room was small but adequate with a decent size bathroom and shower. It is close to two tube stations. The breakfast was OK with cereal, crossoints, eggs, bacon, sausage and toast. We do have some complaints however. The biggest being the thin walls. We were kept awake the first nite by a loud neighbor who quieted down at 1am after we banged on the walls. They did however, continue to talk quietly until 3am and we were able to clearly hear the diminished voices. When we mentioned this to Andrew Bowden, the owner, his response was unsymphatetic. He said this was a well built old building and the walls were thick. Not true!! I think the walls must be single ply and installed simply as room separators. Every nite we could hear our neighbors. We finally purchased heavy duty ear plugs and got some sleep. We were also told by a nite clerk that there was no phone surcharge, there is, it is 50 pence per call. Mr. Bowden, in most of our encounters was short and seemed disinclined to offer any more than minimal information. He seems to have tired of answering guests questions. Overall, for the price, this was adequate accomodations, but bring the ear plugs."
36,788,"Oct 23 2005	Not great wouldn't recommend it	I'd read several good reviews of this place, but had a far from satisfactory stay. Good location - 5-mins walk from the Selfridges end of Oxford St - but on a very busy road. Unless you have the ability to sleep through bedlam do NOT accept one of the rooms on the ground floor facing the road which have flimsy partition walls. I'm not usually a light sleeper but had a totally sleepless night due to an inconsiderate neighbour who had obviously fallen asleep with his TV on full-blast and was snoring like a pig: I tried several times to wake him, unsuccessfully. He eventually awoke by himself at 4am, turned off the TV... and then started shouting into his phone. I knocked on his door and asked him to be quieter due to the thin walls, but to no avail and he continued his 'conversations' until 7am. Through all this hotel staff were unwilling to help or move me to another room. The room itself was clean but shabby, and the bed-sheets were well past their best. No AC or temperature control in the room either, and no way of opening the window (which you wouldn't do any way due to the traffic noise &amp; fumes). Suffice to say I won't be staying there again."
37,788,"Aug 27 2005	Perfect place to stay	Mr. Bowden, Dana, and all the staff:Our trip to London earlier this month was all the better for the accommodations and hospitality of the Hart House Hotel.Quite frankly we didn't know what expect on our arrival -- short of the description of your hotel on your website. But that description was &quot;letter perfect&quot; -- even more so.From the very moment we stepped through your front door, we were treated with a warm welcome, immaculate and most suitable accommodations.We learned, the following morning, that each of our days in London would begin with a sumptuous breakfast in a most comfortable dining room served by a most friendly staff.When we returned to our rooms at the end of each day, we found, once again, perfection in the way the room was cleaned and the beds freshly prepared for another good night of sleep.I could go on, but I believe you get the gist of our visit to the Hart House Hotel -- exceptional, 5-star, most highly recommended.Thanks, again, for helping make our London visit memorable."
38,788,"May 22 2005 	will never stay here again	My husband and i stayed at the Hart house hotel in the month of may for a week.we found the location of the hotel very central and the rooms very clean.the breakfast was nothing great to write back home about but no sweat really.what we found very difficult was the owner's rather not unfriendly but RUDE response to every kind of a harmless simple touristy inquiry.once we even had to hear him shouting and complaning about how he works so hard,his staff feeds us and all he earns from all that was negligible amount of money!we were so shoked by his nasty temper that we will rather look for another hotel next time altho this was a great location and safe and clean place."
39,788,"May 4 2005	Beware if driving - no parking or loading zone	Our room was fine - 1 double bed and one twin for my husband, daughter and myself. It was clean. And we had a nice babysitter one evening. Breakfast was also nice in the mornings. But . . . there is no elevator (lift), and the reception desk staff had no useful knowledge regarding parking in the area (we arrived by car). There is no reasonably priced parking nearby, so we parked in a lot almost a mile away. There is also no loading zone in front of the hotel. So we were socked with a 50 pound parking ticket followed by a 65 pound clamping (over $200 american) while I was getting our daughter ready to leave and my husband was loading the car. The reception desk staff was completely unsympathetic, and a follow-up call to the proprietor yielded the same indifference. That leads me to think that they were just happy to get our money for the room and had no real feeling of responsibility for the happiness of their guests!"
40,788,"Apr 24 2005	would stay here again...very nice	clean clean clean !! huzzah for this wonderful relief and comfort after a long day and night of touring london and the english countryside. the gals taking care of the place and so very nice and your choice at breakfast excellent. you could go very high fat to low fat..and the times were perfect for an early start. breakfast served 7:30 - 9:30 am. the rooms are typical london size..they are small, but maintained and comfortable. we had a double for two of us..room number five. i would recommend this room as well as number eight for a couple. if you are traveling with friends..the triple room was huge. the location is very central...right up from marble arch. bus number 13 runs from the strand (theater area right in front of the savoy) right up glouchester place two doors down from the hotel. paddington station is 1 1/2 miles away....we took the heathrow express train to and from paddington and walked to the hotel. you are considered staying in the marleybone neighborhood &amp; marleybone high street is 3 blocks away...lots of very nice shopping as well as great restaurants. the wallace collection is only 5 minutes away....best kept secret in london. the owner, andrew bowden was great to talk with...enjoy your stay."
41,788,Mar 28 2005	excellent hotel	very clean and well situated. 2 complaints. Breakfast is only served until 9 which is early for vacationers and they put a 5% surcharge on bill when you pay with a credit card which they do not advise you of until checkout.
42,788,"Dec 6 2004	good place to stay	My daughters and I stayed at the Hart House Hotel the first week in November, 2004. It was in a gr8 location, between 2 tube lines, very clean and comfy. We had a room with 1 double and 1 single bed, fine for the 3 of us. It was small, no dresser, but very adequate. The breakfast was average, but a breakfast none-the-less, and the people were nice. It's not a hotel, so there's not a concierge that can direct you around, but we really enjoyed our stay there, and we were hardly ever there anyway, as we were tourists and gone all day touring! Stay there. It will be enjoyable and quiet."
43,788,"Aug 27 2004	Spotlessly Clean Smoke Free	This small hotel is basically a 16-room B&amp;B. All rooms have private baths and the breakfasts are terrific. We particularly liked the location: midway between Oxford Street and Regent's Park. This park may be London's best kept secret (beautiful well-kept gardens, open air theatre, excellent cafe). The London Zoo is at the far north-end of the park (world famous, but disappointing!). We also enjoyed the Wallace Collection, three blocks from the hotel: a better museum than the National Gallery, free admission (but do rent the audio tour), and a gorgeous cafe for lunch."

1,799,"Great location tiny little rooms mediocre service	Chose this hotel for its location - near to Green Park tube. Will not be going back again. The service was mediocre - sometimes good, sometimes standoffish and not helpful. The rooms were really disapointing - and the corridors were small with lots of steps up and down which is a pain.Overall well worth avoiding unless you get a great rate and don't plan to spend any time in the room."
2,799,Nov 21 2009 	Not worthy of 1 star	Horrible pokey room where you can hear everything that goes on in the next room and in the hall way. Do not recommend it at all.
3,799,"Nov 19 2009 	Felt safe and sound	My annual treat, a weekend by myself and I always feel safe and sound. I normally get allocated a single bed room, but my request for a larger room was met which was great. However even in a double room, there no easy chair so I watched TV perched at the end of the bed. Like all Hilton's the bedroom doors slam so loud done the halls, the room shakes. Lovely staff, and I'll be back next year."
4,799,"Nov 17 2009 	This is not a Hilton	The staff are friendly and try hard to please, this is the only good thing I can say about the Hilton Green Park. This hotel is actually several buildings knocked together so it seems a bit disjointed and they have tried to squeeze in too many rooms. The room was small with poor hanging and storage room. It was also scruffy as though it needed redecorating. My room was facing the road so I could hear all the traffic and when my neighbour upstairs came back to his romm at 2am, I could hear him taking his shoes off and trampling around the room because of the wooden floorboards.I ate once in the restaurant and wouldn't recommend it. I ordered pork chopS and only received one. The potatoes and vegetables were all hidden underneath it. The &quot;chop&quot; had been marinated in red and white wine but it didn't taste any different from ordinary chops.I will not be staying here unless they rebuild it."
5,799,Nov 14 2009 	Good location 	Overnighted here recently. Located just off Piccadilly between Green Park and Park Lane. Clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again. Very convenient.
6,799,"Nov 3 2009 	Not what you expect of Hilton	Not a typical Hilton. The rooms are small (even provide single bed rooms.) For a North American traveller, this will take some adjusting to. Unlike the Hilton Park Lane, this is a much smaller hotel. The staff though friendly, do not have the same polish. The hotel is slightly more run down, though there is modern furnish. Housekeeping leave some to be desired. The location is fantastic - 5min walk to a very accessible subway station from various different lines. Not more than a 3-star hotel."
7,799,"Oct 24 2009 	Good location but....	So the location is good, but the hotel is really not more then 2+ stars or maximum 3. The room and everything else about the hotel is so small and cramped so I almost got clausterphobic. Staff was ok although you got the feeling of the really fake friendyness which I hate. The airconditioner did not heat up the room and it makes a hell of a noice.So to summarize if you can get it for a maximum of 100 Eur per night then it might be an option."
8,799,"Oct 4 2009 	Satisfactory stay at deeply discounted rate	After winning the Hilton Green Park on Priceline, I was concerned by the hotels decidedly mixed reviews. My 3-night stay ended up being fine, on the whole, but Im glad I only paid $75 per night ($90 per night after taxes and fees). I liked the hotels location in Mayfair, right across the street from Green Park and around the corner from Shepherd Market. I also appreciated the friendly, helpful staff, especially Michelle at reception, who was such a welcoming presence at check-in. I didnt have any major requests to make during my stay, but whenever I needed something routine  replacement of a room key that had become demagnetized, or storing of luggage for a few hours  I received smiling, efficient service.After reading many previous reviews complaining about the hotels small rooms, I was pleasantly surprised by the spaciousness of my room. It turned out that I had been assigned to an accessible room, so the extra space in both bedroom and bathroom was to accommodate a wheelchair. Although spacious, the room had little closet and drawer space. The walls were scuffed, the carpet was old and stained in places, and the furniture had nicks on it. There was a brown velvet sofa that I never sat on, not knowing what multitude of stains might be hidden by the dark color. Overall, the room just felt old and tired, and in need of refurbishment. Thankfully, the bed was comfortable and the white bed linens were pristine. Soundproofing could have been better  I could hear noise from the street and conversations in the hallway very clearly. Fortunately, my earplugs helped me to get a good nights sleep. The hotel, like all Hiltons, charges something exorbitant for Internet access. Fortunately, there are two branches of Pret nearby, so I toted my netbook over there to use their free wi-fi, which was fast and reliable."
9,799,"Sep 28 2009 	Great location	Stayed for one night last week as had tickets for 'Billy Elliott' and the theatre is wtihin easy walking distance. Unfortunate that building work was going on at the time and scaffolding erected outside our bedroom window; to be fair the work finished at 6pm and didn't start until 9am but it was a shame we had to keep the curtains closed all the time otherwise we would have been looking at the bulder's bottom! Tiny room, kept banging our heads on the sloping ceiling - and a rather strange noise like an aircraft landing every time a loo was flushed in ours and nearby rooms. Expensive at 240 gbp for one night booked well in advance. Plus point - fantastic buffet breakfast and friendly staff."
10,799,"Sep 27 2009 	Perfect Location	Hotel cant be beat for access to all of London. Across Green Park from Buckingham Palace, nice reasonable restaurants in area as well as expensive. Staff is very accomodating."
11,799,"Sep 24 2009 	An Enjoyable Stay	My wife and I spent three enjoyable nights at the Hilton Green Park after a cruise. We were fortunate to have a quiet back room. Friends staying at the same time were assigned a street room and the noise level was so bad that they requested a back room on the second night.For those travelling to Heathrow Airport, the hotel has a fixed rate car service at 40 GBP. When you consider the cost of a taxi from the hotel to Paddington and the train fare (16.50 GBP each person) plus the convenience of a private car, the hotel service is better value.As others have stated, the location is the best.Canadian travellers from Perth, Ontario"
12,799,"Sep 8 2009 	Great Little Hotel in Good Location	Spent two days at the Hilton Green Park, small hotel with lovely modern rooms, singles are neat but well furnished with everything you need and good bathrooms. Hotel is in a great location, 5 minutes from the Ritz and 10 minutes walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace. The London Bus tours even stop outside Green Park Tube Station which again is 5 mins walk. Staff are excellent."
13,799,"Sep 6 2009 	Make sure you book if you want dinner in the hotel restaurant	Great trip - August 2009 Bank Holiday Weekend. Everything was perfect - until we tried to have dinner in the hotel restaurant. Our request to the restaurant hostess was firstly to enquire if we had booked (there were three other couples eating in a virtually empty restaurant) and in response to our &quot;no - but we are resident&quot;, we were requested to have a drink in the bar because &quot;they didn't want everyone to eat at the same time&quot;... oh dear, the poor chef, unable to cope with more than 6 meals at one sitting! Needless to say that we went and had a meal elsewhere! I told the Reception staff at check in who advised me that they would &quot;look in to the matter!&quot; Hey ho! One good tip - definitely try Langans in Strattan Street - even in jeans and without a reservation, they fitted us in - on a Friday evening at 8pm with no fuss, no quibble. And don't be scared, it's VERY reasonably priced (similar to Carluccios) - and excellent customer service."
14,799,"Sep 4 2009 	Excellent Stay Highly Recommend	I just laugh at the posters who give this hotel a bad rating. They must be used to staying at the Taj Mahal. Buckingham Palace is directly across from Green Park. Perhaps they can get a room there because nothing else would seem to please them.This hotel has a friendly staff. The location is central, it is very clean and all of the staff provides great service. I have stayed here several times and my last stay of five nights was a delight. By European standards, I did not find my room to be too small as others have stated.I guess there is just no pleasing some people, but I was extremely pleased with this hotel and I would recommend it to anyone. Ignore the hotel snobs. You will like this hotel."
15,799,"Sep 2 2009 	Service with a smile!	Perhaps some critics of this hotel are more used to larger corporate type hotels, but this is a mews hotel so the rooms are bound to be smaller. We regularly stay at either Flemings directly opposite or the Green Park Hilton dependant on the price available. O.K. Flemings is a tad more stylish, but one thing about both hotels is the friendliness of the staff. A three day stay for two rooms worked out at 300 cheaper than Flemings and included dinner for one night, a full breakfast buffet as opposed to a plated one at Flemings, and you would be hard pressed to tell the difference in qual;ity between both hotels. The ideal location for West End theatres and galleries makes it the ideal choice. If only they would do something about that eyesore of a derelict building on the corner. A request when booking for a front room was noted and supplied. Another troublefree and smooth stay with excellent breakfast and dinner . Keep up the good work"
16,799,"Aug 31 2009 	Superb hotel for the money	My friend and I stayed at Hilton Green Park Hotel for the weekend, forn the 2 nights for 1 promotion, and the hotel was superb!!!! Lovely clean and comfortable room and staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was wonderful and would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who likes value for money deals."
17,799,"Aug 30 2009 	great hotel great location great service!!!	Stayed here for 3 nights in a Deluxe room which was of a good size. Very clean. Alright it's not the Hilton Park Lane but this is a hidden gem. The location is just fantastic, right in the heart of Mayfair and across the road from Green Park and about 15 minutes walking to Piccadilly. The staff were so friendly and made you feel like you were right at home. Couldn't fault breakfast, really a good spread! My only fault with this hotel is the parking, the nearest being about a 10 minute walk and about 40 per night. Be great if they could negotiate a special rate for guests at this hotel. Did hear other guests complaining about room size but again for a little bit more, stay in a deluxe room. It's well worth the money. Staying there in another 3 weeks!!"
18,799,Aug 28 2009 	Not a good hotel!	This hotel was the worst Hilton I had ever stayed in... the walls were so thin you feel like your sleeping in the hallway.
19,799,"Aug 25 2009 	Shocking	This is genuinely one of the worst hotels i have stayed in. It is an embarassment to the name Hilton and to London...It is ludicrously expensive which is based upon it's excellent location. That is the only thing that it has going for it. Arriving there a noted that the public areas are small and shabby and the overall ambiance is 1 star at best. So this was not a good start. Then i got to the room (and i use the word &quot;room&quot; advisedly)The room which was a single was quite literally unbelievable. It was right up in the roof with a really low ceiling. It was tiny (smaller than my none to capacious bathroom at home) and the shower room was basically an enlarged cupboard. I utterly rejected this room and demanded something bigger stating that If i got such a room in a youth hostel i would demand something else and how could they even contemplate selling this. It was obvious this was not the first time this had happened and quickly they did get another room..It was a queen room and was the size of a normal single. Having no choice but to accept this at an extra 10 because it was late, i had an uncomfortable night and woke up to admire the view of the fire escape and the rubbish strewn vacant lot beyond....so celubrious..not.... Oh My God! Never stay there. It is a nightmare and then you see the bill and it becomes &quot;a nightmare on elm street&quot;"
20,799,"Aug 3 2009 	FIrst come first served!	pre booked and paid for 3 nights at this hotel on the hilton website for my boyfriend and I. When we arrived at around 23.00hrs as i had stated when booking, we were told that all the double rooms had been given away as they were really busy and unfortunately it was a 'first come, first served' situation. They gave us two single bed rooms which were cupboard sized. Not exactly a romantic wknd away! When you book a room and prepay for it, its not acceptable to be told its first come, first served. Very poor behaviour from a hilton, expected much better. Otherwise, location and breakfast good and got a regular double room for the 2nd and 3rd night and it was fine. Got a 50% refund for the first night mess up."
21,799,"Jun 28 2009 	Could not fault it!!	I honestly can't believe all the bad reviews. We have just returned from a 2 night stay, my husband and I plus my sister in law and brother in law, so we had two rooms and had no complaints with either. We had deluxe rooms, which were a great size and the en-suite was really big. Everything you would expect, large comfy bed, pillows the best we have had in any hotel recently, air-con, wall mounted flat screen TV, tea and coffee making facilities etc, what more could you want??The location is fantastic, so central, but being set down a side street no problems with noise. OK, it is several buildings knocked into one, but the undulating corridors just added to the appeal, it's not just a modern tailor made hotel building, it has far more character than that!Breakfast was lovely, the usual English etc, or if you preferred waffles or pancakes made to order.Would we return? Without a doubt all of us would"
22,799,"Jun 28 2009 	Shoebox	This is my first stay in a European hotel, and my first reaction is that it is SMALL!!! (approx 7'x12') Compared to hotel rooms in the US, my single room at the Hilton Green Park hotel was less than half the size. The bathroom was close to normal size, though. The single twin bed was a bit stiff (and shorter than usual) but otherwise comfortable. Not enough pillows or pillow selection. Not much room for my suitcase. Flat screen TV was wall-mounted and plenty large. Tea/coffee selection was excellent and included a shortbread cookie. I love that the room had a electric hot water kettle. Great for business travel. Internet and local phone calls are not free. No gym, but great parks nearby. The B&amp;B rate included breakfast, which was so-so (don't expect omlets like Embassy Suites). Marks &amp; Spencer around the corner at the Green Park tube stop. Very convenient. Great location. I would stay here again."
23,799,"Jun 18 2009 	Fawlty Towers 2009	My family and I stayed at the Hilton Green Park (or should I say, Fawlty Towers) for 6 nights. The hotel is in a good location in Mayfair, near the Ritz and Green Park, the staff were pleasant enough and the breakfast was good and fresh. Everything else was awful. The hotel seemed to be 3-4 townhouses that were cobbled together - without being gutted and barely having been renovated - leaving random groups of steps in the middle of the upstairs hallways and zero sound-proofing. Our first room was at the end of the 4th floor hallway and we had our 2 yo with us in her stroller and would have to maneuver the stroller 3-4 times to get over the randomly placed steps before arriving to our room. The door to the room was at the beginning of a long, narrow and dark hallway which opened up to a very dark, albeit large enough, space overlooking some dingy backs of buildings. The water in the shower seemed indecisive, switching from hot to cold every few seconds or so. The extra roll of toilet paper was never replenished. The floors in our room, outside our door and above us creaked so loudly that it was disturbing. Also, eventhough we were at the end of the hallway, there was so much noise outside our door, it felt like people were about to come into our room all day long. Halfway through our stay, the internet access ceased working and we were finally moved to another room, after my husband was told by the staff at the front desk that he would have to call their service provider to ascertain the problem. After a day of this nonsense, we were moved to a room down the hall from our original room. This time, there was more light as we were at the front of the hotel (half moon street I think?) but it was five times more noisy as the door of the room opened straight into the living space and all the foot traffic from the main hallway felt as it was happening in our room! I was wishing for the first room with the long interior hallway that in hindsight muffled some sounds a little bit. Also, one of the 3 windows in this room did not close all the way so you felt the draft and heard all of the outside traffic (and jack hammers from the road work at the corner) all night and the one in the bathroom had mold all around the panes. We had the same problem with the water temperature, but this time, we at least had internet access. Oh, and yes, the beds were horribly soft and definitely bottom-of-the-line. The floors again were incredibly squeaky, and you could hear the people upstairs and outside of your room very clearly. I should also mention that there was some problem with the fire alarms which caused them to go off several times during our stay there, once during the middle of the night. And, that later, we were invited to a cocktail reception for &quot;special guests&quot; (I am sure it was everyone staying in the hotel) by a paper invitation under our door, which was then followed by a pleading call from the front desk. When I told the staff member who was calling that we would not be attending, she started begging us to come. Totally unprofessional!But to top it all off, my daughter's hand got caught in the hotel's revolving door and no one in the lobby (there were about 4-5 staff there) could figure out what to do. They all stood around dumbfounded at the sight - and one of the doormen/concierge, even attempted turning the door with her hand stuck between it and the glass frame, in a totally illogical effort to free her!!! Luckily, my husband knew how to unlock the revolving door and the whole thing was almost over swiftly except for the fact there were several trips made by a staff member back and forth from the kitchen to the bar in order to determine how to get ice for my sobbing daughter's hand afterwards. The GM later came to our room to find out what he could do for us and to tell us that he had watched the video footage to learn more about the events that transpired. In fairness, there was not much he could do, but the fact that he mentioned there being a video of the occurrence and that he was watching it seemed a little odd. In hindsight, this experience will stay in my mind and is what now makes our stay at the Hilton Green Park seem like an episode of Fawlty Towers.We will never stay in this hotel again. It is not worth it."
24,799,"Jun 15 2009 	Pleasant Surprise	We were looking for a hotel near to Park Lane, that could accomodate 3 persons and which was reasonably priced. This hotel fulfilled these requirements.The room was large enough for the three of us with a sofa that converted into a double bed. The room was well presented and was clean and tidy. The bathroom was functional and perfectly adequate. Curtains didn't keep the light out so we all woke early. Good A/C in the room.Breakfast was included and the quality was much higher than the bigger Hilton Hotels.We would definately try and book this hotel again."
25,799,"Jun 3 2009 	Better than expected from previous reviews	We won Hilton / Green Park from Priceline for our last day in London, and I was nervous after reading the reviews. However, it turned out great. Our room was actually spacious by London standards, quiet, and had a very comfortable bed. The location is convenient., about 3 blocks from the tube, and 1 block from Green Park. There is a nice &quot;hidden&quot; street nearby (Shepherd's Lane) with several pubs, a drug store, a few restaurant choices, etc. The staff was very helpful, allowed us to check in early, and kept our luggage after check-out until time for us to leave the following evening ( at no cost except tip).We stayed over a Sunday evening, which is typically not a busy time, so that may have contributed to the quiet atmosphere. If the hotel were busier, I could understand how noise might be a problem. Only complaints: The halls are old, very narrow, and need updating. The room carpet was either soiled or worn around the perimeter and torn in several locations, but everything else was quite nice. For the price we paid, it was a definite bargain."
26,799,"Jun 2 2009 	Could have been better	I read all the comments on the hotel and I was scared to go there!!!!!The location is great: in front of green park, 10 minutes walking of Piccadilly Circus.The staff is really nice.We were 4 so we had 2 rooms (1 double bed in each).The design was correct but nothing great.The bed was however really bad (too soft on the sides so I kept on falling on the night table... very dangerous)We were on the 5th floor (out of 6).The corridor was very noisy and it was like they were talking in my own room!!!The bathroom was very simple but clean.The breakfast was good.Air conditionner in every rooms but no curtains at the windows......No free internet connectionWe paid 129  per night breakfast included in may 2009 so I would say it was a correct quality for the price, but from a Hilton, I was expecting more!!Is Hilton buying many hotels in London in order to be ready for the Olympic Games? I don't know, but fore sure, it wasn't designed to be a Hilton!!!"
27,799,May 21 2009 	NOT THE BEST HILTON I HAVE STAYED IN	This hotel is ideally situated for the underground being just a two minute walk from Green Park Underground. However the room was the smallest Hilton room I have slept in and the bed was a tad short for me. I would however like to praise the cleaner as it was always spotless and well presented. Paid for buffet breakfast on one occasion and again slightly dissapointed. I have never had a cooked breakfast without sausages but trust me this is what is in store for you should you avail yourself of the food. Staff were pleasant and helpful. I don't think I would stay here again although I wouldn't put anyone off doing so.
28,799,"Apr 29 2009 	Great Hotel	We stayed here for a few days and somehow ended up with a suite. It was great, top floor on the end and plenty of space! There was a living area attached to the sleeping area, a GIANT dressing room, and very large bathroom. We almost had too much space for the amount of time we were actually in the room. There weren't many restuarants nearby so we did have to walk a little for that. Also the tours don't stop at this hotel, so we had to walk to another Hilton that took about ten minutes. As far as the price, it made up for what it lacked in location.. I'm just not sure I'd return to London in December!!"
29,799,"Apr 25 2009 	Could the rooms be smaller?	Why doesn't Hilton give this property one of its budget brand names -- Hampton Inns, or something -- and stop diminishing the Hilton brand like this? The rooms at this hotel are tiny. My &quot;Diamond&quot; upgraded room could not have been smaller, was not air conditioned (and uncomfortably warm), had paper-thin walls, and overlooked a filfthy vacant lot. Aggressive effort to empty the rooms at check-out time, with maids ignoring the &quot;don not disturb signs.&quot;"
30,799,"Apr 11 2009	At the right price - a real gem	Stayed here for two nights at the bargain price of 127 for two. It was perfectly situated - close to the shops - reasonable walk to the theatre and very close to Buckingham Palace. Yes, the room was small, but do you really go to a London hotel to stay in the room? And the breakfast, fab and included in the price."
31,799,"Apr 6 2009 	Practical Lodging for Business Travellers	This hotel is definately not to be mistaken for a destination. You simply book here to sleep, go to work and eat breakfast. They have no useful amenities and rooms are way to small to be enjoyable. Room service is often left on the lower level hallway for more than 24hrs even though the cleaners pass right by it. For anyone disturbed by small places definately don't book the single room. Most birds nests are bigger. Breakfast served every morning is actually the one highlight. It's a typical english breakfast that most North Americans would delight in. Due to its proximity to entertainment you will find this hotel convenient for short trips after work.We found Picadilly Circus and Oxford Street to be very short walking distances from the Hotel.As for local restuarants we tried two nice places in short walking distance:Le Duca - Italian Restaurant La Boudin Blanc - French RestaurantMost advanced palates would enjoy their offerings. The French Lamb Ratatouille was just amazing.Overall don't plan on spending time in the hotel. Just drop your bags and come back exhausted, so you don't think about your cramped quarters."
32,799,"Apr 3 2009 	Nice quiet hotel in convenient location	We stayed briefly for 1 night recently on our visit to London. The hotel is well located for walking around London tourists' spots (e.g. it is very near Buckingham Palace) and for public transport (the nearest tube station was less than 5 minutes' walk away). The hotel is off a side street, so, is quiet at night, which suited us fine. Green Park is over the road from the hotel's street, so, is a pleasant walk in the mornings.Our double room wasn't huge but was adequate and comfortable enough for our needs. Bearing in mind that the hotel is in central London, the size of our room was perfectly acceptable (as we had 2 large suitcases with us). Shower was good with plenty of hot water and there were the usual complimentary refreshments and toileteries in the room. Temperature control in the room was excellent.We had breakfast included in our booking and tried out the buffet breakfast. It was a reasonably decent breakfast, though nothing outstanding (but nothing really bad either!).All in all, no complaints and would not hesitate to come back."
33,799,"Mar 28 2009 	Nice Hotel	stayed there over night visiting london for a concert, great location, walkable to all main tourist sites.room was slightly too small but guess thats london, no twins were available but had a nice stay"
34,799,"Mar 26 2009 	Excellent Location	We stayed here for 2 nights either side of our holiday. It was very central, worked in great for both the Heathrow &amp; Gatwick Express. We walked everywhere easily, it was great. We found this hotel through 'priceline' at 70 odd a night, would not pay much more though! The room was quite small, but it was clean and had a powerful shower. We had no noise in either stay. All staff were lovely. Our booking did not include breakfast (which was very steep), there was a Tesco Metro &amp; Starbucks around the corner which was great."
35,799,"Mar 13 2009 	Great location excellent service nice room	The Green Park Hilton is in a fabulous location. It is steps away from the tube, grocery store, Pret and Starbucks. We stayed four days and were very happy with the accommodations. We got a really good deal on Priceline, and it was well worth every penny that we spent. The room, while not huge in size, seemed just right for two of us. The front staff was extremely pleasant and helpful, even letting us check in a bit early. We did not have the breakfast or eat in the restaurant, but they did offer a pre-fixed menu for 19.00 pounds (dinner). We were on the first floor, and apparently right above the lounge/restaurant, and we could hear music play throughout the day and night. It was very faint, but every now and then you could really hear the beat of the music. One thing that was somewhat disappointing was the wireless internet. I website states that the rooms have high-speed internet in the rooms. While there is a box for the internet and you can have wireless, you have to pay for it, and I believe it was approximately 20.00 pounds per day. Or you could buy cards, which we did, and 15 minutes was 5.00 pounds. Quite expensive, although still less expensive than calling home everyday. We would stay at this location again."
36,799,"Feb 23 2009	Great hotel -	I just back from the Hilton Green Park and I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. The first thing to remember is that this nice Hilton, but not glamorous and high-end. If you are looking for that kind of experience, try elsewhere.If you are looking for a hotel that gives great service, nice comfortable rooms (if a bit on the small side), a GREAT breakfast and a location that cant be beat  this is for you. The Green Park Tube is steps away and so is charming Shepherds Market. Oxford St. is a 15 minute stroll as is St. James, Jermyn St. and Piccadilly Circus. I have stayed in a number of hotels in the area and I have found this to a great place to stay. Room G33 was large and had a fold out sofa, flat screen TV but looked out onto the ventilation shaft. There was plenty of light and everything was very comfortable. I must mention Kareem, the concierge and his team. He worked hard for me (last minute reservations etc) and came through with flying colors. This has become my London hotel of choice."
37,799,"Feb 13 2009 	Great location - shame about everything else...	I really dont like writing negative reviews, and although there was no one major problem with this hotel, there were just so many little problems that all added up to making this such a bad stay. I want to make clear that I dont normally moan, I just cannot believe how bad our stay was in comparison to so many other London hotels, and I wanted to tell our experience honestly.Room: We had a standard room, which in itself was ok  quite small but big enough for two people. It was pretty clean, the bathroom didnt smell particularly clean but the sheets etc were. The window and the curtains were dirty though. Our room was on the first floor and overlooked some kind or air vent, probably from the kitchen, however was not noisy. But, our first night in the room was awful  there is no a/c and the room was too hot  we had turned the radiator off earlier in the day, but the temperature was still really high. The noise from the corridor was continuous  there was a group on our floor and until 4am there were doors slamming and people screaming in the corridor  several calls to the night reception were in vain  nothing was done.We moved to a room on the 4th floor for the last two nights  even smaller and dirty under the bed  the remains of room service I think! The bed was really hard and uncomfortable. We were awoken on Sunday and Monday morning at 8am by workmen on scaffolding outside our room  no lie in for us!! Not just small noise, heavy crashes and drilling, impossible to sleep through even with earplugs! The hotel is undergoing the installation of air conditioning, and there is work constantly occuring at the hotel.Breakfast: Saturday breakfast was really good, felt organised and under control. There was huge choice and variety and everything was fresh. However, the breakfast on Sunday and Monday was bad  hardly any choice and really poorly stocked. We waited 20 minutes for a table, even though the breakfast room wasnt even half full  there were not enough staff to serve or clean, and the food did not seem fresh. There were signs in the lifts warning of queues, but the experience I had could have easily been sorted with more organisation and better management.Hotel staff: Generally very friendly, and I feel that many of the problems were out of their control  the hotel management needs to address these issues, not ignore them as I felt was happening.I booked a long weekend for a romantic getaway, not just a sightseeing weekend, and so I guess I expected/wanted more from my room than many tourists would. It is in a great location, so if you will be out all day and only sleeping in the hotel, this is a good base.However. I have stayed in many Hiltons before, and this one was by far the worst  a real embarrassment for a London hotel, and a very poor example of Hilton as a brand. It did not live up to expectations, and I really dont feel that it deserves its 4* rating. I left my trip feeling really disappointed and having a poor view of Hilton  this hotel could be so good but at the moment it is not  there are better hotels for the same money and I would not recommend this hotel for any London visit."
38,799,"Feb 11 2009 	Cant beat this hotel!	Just come back from London, stayed at the Hilton, it was fantastic!Staff were really friendly, couldn't do enough for us, polite, pleasent and really helpful. The rooms were really nice, clean, and very well stocked. Didn't need to take anything apart from your clothes, and maybe your straightners! They provided shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap, handwash, hand cream, shower cap, flannels, towels, hairdryer, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, biscuits, all free of charge. It was fab!Breakfast was provided in the morning which was really nice. You could have full english, cereal, cakes, toast, yougurts, fruit, almost anything.The location of the hotel was ideal, 2 stops away from Victoria Station on the tube. Close to most things, Big Ben, Houses of Parliment, Buckingham Palace, Oxford street , Knightsbridge. Only 2 or 3 stops on the tube to all of these places. Went to the O2 arena, the train went straight from Green Park to the O2 without changing. Didn't need to use taxi's all weekend.Cant say enough good things about this hotel, i WILL be going back! No doubt about it!"
39,799,Jan 29 2009 	Great location competent hotel good overall value	Small hotel in converted townhouses. Not many facilities. Reasonable rooms. Great location and nothing to complain about
40,799,"Jan 28 2009 	cosy and friendly hotel	This is a small, friendly, cosy hotel situated in a side street just off Picadilly which means that it is exceptionally quiet for a hotel set in the heart of London. We had a room at the front and were not even disturbed by traffic noise. Staff and service excellent. Comfortable rooms and beds. Excellent breakfast. However, evening dinner in the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. The crab and avocado tower was wet and tasteless, the teryaki beef overdone and the beef was tough. Such a shame as the restaurant itself is comfortable and the decor and table arrangement good. Very few guests appear to have their evening meal here. We stayed 3 nights on honour reward points. It is disappointing that there is no executive lounge for honours guests. Also no bathrobe or complimentary slippers provided. Surprising as the number of points used were the same as for a stay at the Waldorf or Park Lane Hilton."
41,799,"Jan 28 2009 	Small but comfortable rooms good location easy Tube access to Heathrow	I needed an inexpensive place to stay for one night, with easy access to Heathrow to catch a morning flight to the US. Of course, I could have picked an airport hotel, but what fun would that be?So instead, I picked the London Hilton Green Park. They offered a January sale rate of about GBP 55 including breakfast for a single room on a Saturday night, which was a steal for a central London location.With easy access to the Green Park Piccadilly Tube line station I had a very easy connection to London Heathrow for only about GBP 5 or so. Not very fast (about 1 hr) and not great if you have a lot of luggage, but since I didn't have to transfer and the hotel was literally a five minute walk from the station, pretty convenient.As described in other reviews, the Hilton Green Park is a row of old houses that are turned into a small hotel. Because of this, the hotel corridors are full of steps and stairs, so not great if you have difficulties walking - in that case, ask for a room that is easily accessible. I booked a single room, which was just that. A small room with single bed with duvet, a private bathroom with combined bathtub and shower, a small work desk, flat screen TV. The room featured a safe and paid Internet access. I was on the fourth floor and had a view of the roof tops towards Shepherds Market. The windows slide up for fresh air. I did not notice an airconditioning unit or vent - so that would be something to check out before you stay in the summer! Overall, the room was comfortable enough for my short stay. Possibly because I am a Hilton HHonors silver member, there was a bottle of still water waiting for me - but no glass, and the bottle was unceremoniously plonked on the side table.The reception staff were friendly but not overly service oriented and seemed to be checking in a lot of weekend guests at this low rate. The breakfast buffet was very nice. Good selection, and because I was early on a Sunday morning, not too busy. (There were signs in the lift to state that the hotel expected the breakfast to be really busy and they therefore extended the opening hours of the buffet.)The location is good: easy access to Green Park station and the buses on Piccadilly. The Shepherds Market restaurants and bars are right behind the hotel as well, so quite a few not-so-touristy dining options. There is a Tesco Express mini-supermarket nearby too and a Marks and Spencers Express above the Green Park station, if you want to buy something to eat or drink in you room. You are about a 10 minute walk from Bond Street, the Burlington Arcade and across Green Park from Buckingham Palace. Hyde Park is about a 15 minute walk.I probably would not rate this hotel a four-star, or particularly suited for business travel, but would stay here again if the price was right.All in all, if you don't expect luxury, but you want a comfortable, reliable room in a good location, this is a good hotel."
42,799,"Jan 26 2009 	A fair deal	Excellent location. Quiet, yet very central, in the heart of Maifair London. Around 10 minutes walk to some of London's main attractions, such as: Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Street, Buckingham Palace or Knightsbridge (Harrods). Two minutes walk to Green Park subway station. This 4 stars hotel is located in an old building, but is pretty well maintained. Those who are expecting top standards might be a little dissapointed, as the hotel is a bit below Hilton's usual standards, but it is definitely above average standards for Central London, at this price (around 160 GBP / double room / night). Room was small, but clean, with a nice and well equipped bathroom (we had a standard double roon, with qeen size bed) The main problem was that we could actually hear the people walking in the room above us (it sounded like an old wooden celing...). Excellent hotel stuff, friendly and helpful. V|ery good English breakfast (5 star standard, at a 4 star hotel). Hotel is not cheap, but overall the rate seems fair, given the location. A possible problem for those traveling during the summer period might be the air conditioning, which did not work at the time of our stay (there was an &lt;out of service&gt; label on the air condition switch on the wall). Just double check before booking. I would recommend this hotel for those looking for a perfect location in Central London, with good service standards, at an almost fair price (given the air conditioner is working...)"
43,799,"Jan 23 2009 	Let down by the standard of the room	Good location, helpful staff and good standard of breakfast. However the room was not up to 4 star standard. The carpet was dirty on the edge all round, the window would not shut, the heating could not be controlled, the standard lamp did not work and the decoration was marked. There was a letter in the room that referred to an imminent refurbishment programme. Yes we had booked on a good deal, but there remains the suspicion that we were given a poor quality room as bargain customers - not the way to get repeat business."
44,799,"Dec 14 2008 	Great location good hotel - excellent value	The Hilton Green Park is a nice hotel that is right in the center of everything - steps from the green park tube station - on a side street in mayfair and doesn't look like your generic hotel. It is quite reasonable in cost and has all the services one needs. The rooms are smallish but more than sufficient - the bar is nice and there are oodles of restaurants right in the neighborhood, if you don't want to eat there. The staff is very curtious. To me this is the perfect london hotel... When there it is my home away from home."
45,799,"Dec 8 2008	Good location - slightly disappointing!	I stayed here with 5 frineds for a festive reunion in London. This hotel is very centrally located easily accessible to the cities main attractions. The rooms are clean,comfortable and a standard size for London. As a diamond member of Hilton one of the 3 rooms we had booked was upgraded, it looked ordinary but was slightly more spacious.The reception staff and concierge team were extremely welcoming and helpful.A few problems were experienced with the Food and Beverage staff, namely the staff serving breakfast. I since learnt there were staffing problems that morning and that was clearly evident. Service was poor and standards generally low for a Hilton.Sarah the duty manager was excellent and dealt with our party in an extremely professional manner.Overall this hotel is very central with a warm and friendly atmosphere ."
46,799,"Dec 3 2008 	Great hotel great location exceptional staff	8 of us stayed here for a birthday celebration in London. The location cannot be beaten, a great part of London with lots within walking distance and an amazing restaurant in a street just behind the hotel.The standard rooms were well decorated, very clean &amp; the beds really comfortable. The rooms were quite small but that is what we expect in London.We all commented on how friendly &amp; helpful all the staff were including check-in, concierge, barmen &amp; waiters. The buffet breakfast was excellent. We also had a great snack lunch at the hotel which we did not feel was overpriced. Our only criticism would be the high bar prices for alcoholic drinks.We would recommend this hotel."
47,799,"Dec 1 2008 	Good but not Perfect	I stayed at the Hilton Green Park for a business function combined with a short visit to London with my partner.We found the hotel to be clean and the room (De-lux) was spacious by London standards and nicley decorated in a modern style. The bed was great and there was a large flat screen TV.Price is quite high, and beware: we were given a price which did not include VAT! This is very unusual and added quite a bit to the finished cost.Pink corridor decor was a bit odd, and the toilets in the public areas were out of order which meant a long wait outside the disabled toilet or a reurn to the room when drinking at the bar.My other gripe about the bar is the total lack of British beer- something I expect in a London hotel in a region known for it's great real ales- Imagine going to Germany and getting offered only Stella! Very poor.Bar prices were also a bit steep even fopr London, and some mysterious &quot;Service Charges&quot; were added to drinks purchased at the bar- only a few pence but they added up.The breakfast was included in the price and it was excellent, only a short wait even at busy weekend times- top marks here!Staff were helpful but service was a little slow, they forgot to bring our bags to our room wehen we arrived, and room service took ages, they seemed to be understaffed.The location is great however.So, in conclusion: Sort out the beer and the hidden charges, speed up the service and you have a good hotel in a great location, if not a cheap one."
48,799,"Nov 30 2008 	Great location in central London	I stayed here with my husband for one night last week, using my Hilton reward points. We were arriving at Heathrow early in the morning and though we had to wait a while in the (very comfortable) lobby, we were able to check in much earlier than expected, and were grateful.Our room was tiny, with only just enough room for our bags in the available floor space, but it was also clean and reasonably well appointed. It was fine for one night. We had intended to have room service at dinner time but there was no way we'd have got a tray in as well. It's a pity that hotels sometimes give you the less attractive rooms when you're using reward points, as you have no way of knowing whether it's worth going back again when you're spending hard cash. Having said that, we got exactly what we expected and were satisfied. The hotel does a good job of maintaining the Hilton standard in this historic Georgian terrace and offers good value in a great location."
49,799,"Nov 3 2008 	"" Great Location and Friendly Staff	My husband and myself stayed in the Hilton green for the location. The hotel is in a very quiet street. The staff are very afficient and friendly. The breakfast is very good. Our room was not huge but very clean and tastefully decorated. The location is perfect just opposite green park and only a short taxi ride into the west end theatre area of london.I would have no hesitation in reccommended this hotel to anyone"
50,799,"Oct 17 2008 	Research Carefully To Get Best Value For Your Vacation Dollars....	There is a mixed consensus on the reviews here. My feeling is this: if you like location and are just looking for a place to lie down, this may be the place for you. If you are someone who enjoys being spoiled and enjoying extra little comforts, this may not be the best choice. A nine day business/ pleasure stay at this property, and I was so disappointed! Having been in the UK before, I expected a small room, and tried to keep an open mind.True enough, some UK travelers MAY find this place acceptable. Standard hotel rooms in England can be small, old, dreary, and outdated. I do love the character of London with all of its' old Victorian brick buildings, however, at the end of my sightseeing day I prefer to come &quot;home&quot; to sleep in a nice soft bed, with the option to turn on ac, and sleep the night away without being awakened by 30 minutes of bottle clanging outside the windows at 3 a.m. In mid summer, I really needed the ac. I had a choice of sleeping in a warm room, or tolerating the street and portable ac noise all night. (The air conditioner is hilarious! It is about as big as a washing machine, portable, and has a dryer sized lint hose that you hang out of the open, unscreened window.) Either way, it made for a restless night and did not do a sufficient job of cooling for me. I believe that food trays should be picked up promptly and not be left in the hall for four hours to rot. Bags of garbage and several seasons of piled up leaves should be cleaned up outside in the courtyard &quot;view&quot;. I am not surprised at reports of insects and rodents. These issues have absolutely nothing to do with character....There were so many more issues than creaking floor boards it wasn't even funny! I asked for assistance from the Concierge for booking my tours. After waiting 25 minutes, I informed him that I would give him time to wind up his current duties and I walked into the bar to have a glass of wine. I asked for him to come and get me (15 steps away) when he had time for me. Two glasses later, no concierge. When I went back out, he had another group in. I quietly slipped him a note detailing the tour I wanted and asked him to call my room when he had a chance. The call never came and I booked it myself off of the Internet.Be sure and check your bill, as we found a number of charges that shouldn't have been there. They were removed after checking the tickets and finding that I had written paid in cash. Any charges are automatically rung up as a room charge, so be careful if you opt to pay as you go. Not sure what would have happened if I had not taken this step. A little inconvenient to wade through at check out time, but it was eventually straightened out, so okay.There is no Executive Lounge here; there is a small and cozy little bar area in the lobby. There are suites available that are fairly nice, however, as Diamond Members we were not upgraded and noticed no benefit recognized in any form. The standard rooms at this particular property are really bad by US expectations. Not only are they very small; sheets, towels and blankets are worn and becoming threadbare. Aesthetics aside, these are basics, and who wants to pay a fortune to sleep in a hot, noisy room on knobby sheets? I think that the scattered good reviews were left by those lucky enough to be placed in a suite, or from UK travelers. When researching for a vacation, I take all reviews into account. There are always plusses and minuses, along with varying opinions. From what I see here, you are really taking a chance. The room was booked and paid for by the company for a business trip. We opted to take our chances and collect the reward points for later use. We would have been even more disappointed if we had used our precious rewards or cash for this stay.The location IS fantastic. If this is most important to you, then you may be willing to sacrifice other comforts. The breakfast was very good, and I felt, a good value. Shepards Market is just around the corner and a lovely place to spend your evenings. I really wish that I could think of more positive things to add.For most US travelers, London is the trip of a lifetime. With the exchange rates as they are now, this is going to be a very expensive room for not much value. There are many other properties in the same price range. If you are using reward points, I would look carefully at other choices before booking; you may find that your level of reward is not as expected at this particular Hilton. If you are locked into staying at a Hilton property, Park Lane Hilton is just down the street and would be a MUCH better choice in my opinion."

52,799,"Oct 1 2008 	Great Hotel	I stayed her with my partner for one night with some concerns,having read some of the reviews.I needn't have worried.The hotel is a delight.Staff courteous and efficient.Breakfast perfect.Location perfect.Room not huge but tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean.I can't believe the things that people find to complain about:Creaking floorboards?Did they not notice how old the building is?.I call this character,as I do in my Victorian house!Highly recommended."
53,799,"Sep 30 2008	Excellent hotel convenient to all London sights	Can't believe all these bad reviews. My mum and I have been staying in the Green Park for 10 years now at least once a year and we love it!The staff could not be more helpful and pleasant especially Gil, one of the concierges.The location is second to none 5 mins to Piccadilly and Buckingham Palace and about 10mins to Harrods. What more can you want?"
54,799,"Sep 30 2008 	Good location small room dated	Hotel room was very small, needs to be updated, very old style. Room was very hot, had to keep the window open. Bathroom was also very old style. This hotel needs a face lift. To get to your room it is a maze. Ancient decor.The location is good and convenient to the tube. The price was a good deal but not really up to Hilton standards."
55,799,"Sep 12 2008 	Leaking Celing Hot Noisy 	Ok I think this might be the 1st time I have given a Terrible rating but this deserved it...The ProsLocationThe ConsOn night 4 the ceiling in centre of room started leaking out of the fire alarm, not just few drips but quite a lot, it woke both husband and me up.. we called reception at 1am and they came up and threw a towel on floor as solution.. we said the room may not be safe as feared electricity issues as water leaking right near light fitting and/or celing cave in but no spare rooms.. so was left listening to drips of water. We did get moved next day for our last night but it was to a even smaller room! They did credit us one night stay. But scary to think of bigger issues they have with this old hotel.Room was TINY and had steps, it creaked and it was SO hot in there, no air conditioning only a fan provided..Bed not that comfortable.NO Fridge!Room was NOISY, facing street on 1st floor. Woken every morning to garbage truck at 3am, so so noisy and also hearing drunks till all hours especially on sat night.Bathroo m - the toilet made a horrible noise when flushed, like it was going to explode.. so made flushing toilet in middle of night difficult. The toilet rolls were not in arms reach of toilet.. stupidist design ever seen.. No soap dish holder either.We were booked under work's hilton club members and being a 4 or 5 star hotel expected a lot more, was so disapointed and would never recommend or stay here again. Reception staff ok, breakfast ok.For the money - stay elsewhere. This place needs a major redesign and upgrade and some major repairs!"
56,799,Sep 2 2008 	good do better	this hotel is in a good location but the staff can be quite unpleasant especially in the breakfast rooms talk about if looks could kill maybe they are just not morning people.we stayed on a Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday morning the glass recycling wagon came round and kept us awake for quite awhile so maybe a room at the back of the hotel would be a good idea.on the whole the hotel was very clean and reception was very good but the staff in the dining area want a good dose of customer relations!
57,799,"Aug 21 2008 	Nice toiletries!	Very disappointing. After a long drive from France we arrived tired and hungry and were given the keys to our room on the fifth floor which was small but adequate - the carpet was very stained. We decided to have a quick drink and a quick dinner. I was expecting London prices but thought 7 for a glass of warm white wine in the bar was a little excessive. The dining room had no atmosphere, the tables were arranged around the room leaving a large open area in the middle. The menu was limited and uninspiring, we ordered the Thai burgers - they sounded okay and we thought they would at least be quick. We waited for an hour - they did offer us some bread to keep us going but it came with no aioli or tapenade which we would have enjoyed. The burgers, when they eventually came, were obviously frozen, as were the baps. The sweet chilli sauce had come out of a bottle - the salsa, which at least looked real, was the saving grace. It was a sad meal. The waiter, who was clearly a trainee, told us the reason for our hour wait was that they'd had a lot of room service orders! The staff tried but they needed more training and there needed to be more of them. After being back in the room for about ten minutes the fire alarm sounded - then went off. When my husband went down to reception to check that everything was alright he was told that they didn't even know it had gone off on the fifth floor.The bathroom turned out to be little better - the thermostat on the shower was broken - the water ran scalding hot then freezing cold. The Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries were lovely - the hairdryer only blew cold air. We didn't bother with breakfast - we went to Selfridges instead.It got to the point where it was so awful we were laughing hysterically but it wasn't funny. We weren't on holiday just needed somewhere comfortable to relax, have a nice meal and prepare for the next day - simple requirements which sadly the hotel failed to provide. It is in a fantastic location but, even so, we definitely won't be staying there again."
58,799,"Aug 6 2008 	Great Location - Good Stay	I too have read all of the bad reviews of this hotel and that may have contributed to low expectations leading to a pleasant stay. I'm also a Diamond HH Member and at this hotel it really doesn't help you much. There is no club/concierge floor and they do not include breakfast (which I think would be the least they could do for their HH Members).I had a small room on the 4th floor with a double bed and the large swamp cooling A/C unit that actually did a pretty good job cooling the room (I should mention the outside temp was around 70-75F). I had a little trouble at check in as I think they are a somewhat unorganized but overall I LOVE the location. I took the train direct to/from Heathrow (Piccadily Line) to Green Park and walked the couple blocks to the hotel. Hung out in the park while waiting for my room was a highlight on a great day. There's a map/guide called 'MAPEASY' that I've really started to like when travelling to Europe. It's waterproof/stain resistant and, in addition to popular sights, they locate great pubs and restaurants for you (the Dublin one is also great!). You have to enjoy a couple of histiric 'pub crawls' while in London and this hotel is in a GREAT location for that!! Happy Travels!"
59,799,"Aug 5 2008 	Good location rooms not quite Hilton standard	Good location for sights, shopping or business. On the positive side, the personnel was very friendly and attentive. However, the rooms are not up to Hilton standard. I booked an executive room, but was shown to one next to the elevator shaft. Aware of the noise I rejected the room and the only option was a standard room. Did not get any refund for the downgrade. The room was smaller, facing the rear. The fan took half of the wardrobe and there were stains in the bathroom due to moisture and poor cleaning. The bathroom curtain was really grey and dirty. On second morning (Sunday) we had to wait almost half an hour to get a table at the breakfast room. Apparently this is a very popular hotel after all! If the rooms were maintained a bit better, this could become my favourite London hotel."
60,799,"Aug 4 2008 	Never stay there again	My mum and I visit London every couple of weeks for a weekend, and we stay at this hotel 9 out of 10 times.However our last stay was sooo bad we will never stay there again.We are gold card holders for Hiltons and so always have upgraded rooms and superb service from them, so we were mortified to see our room was the size of a matchbox and had very old deco and curtains that actually fell off in my hand when i attempted to open them. However this we ignored as we were not intending staying in the room for anymore than to sleep.The room was like an absolute sauna, and had no air conditioning, again we were to fussy about this and tried to open the windows - which was impossible!We called a member of staff to open the windows (which i was afraid were going to fall straight through because they were so old) and he did so. We then went for a meal in the hotel and upon returning to the room at 10pm we could only hear screaming and shouting from outside the window, we were directly above an alleyway full of pubs and bars!The window wouldnt shut and so we spent the night awake by the constant noise from the alleyway one floor below us, and because of our window position the room had no air being blown in and was still boiling!By 11pm i had no choice but to ask for a room change to be told that the hotel was fully booked! My father had previously rung to check availability and was told only an hour before that there were plenty of rooms free for tonight so that was complete lies. The staff member was quite rude and didnt even ask what the problem was and wouldnt let me finish my reasoning of why i wanted to move rooms.Back to the room i went and attempted to go to sleep but to my utter disgust the bed was full of fleas!! Mum and I had flea bites all over us the next day and spent the whole night scratching.On top of this the food in the hotel was unacceptable and i waited 35minutes for a coke and 20 minutes for my chips after my main had been served, my main was therefore freezing and my guests had all eaten by the time i was able to eat. With regards to desert, i ordered a cheese board which apparently have 4 different cheeses, just to recieve four chunks of brie cheese and bread instead of crackers.Small inconviences like this caused this stay to be the worse one ever and to put us off this hotel completely."
61,799,"Jul 29 2008	The Green Park Hilton is getting a bad rap.... I liked this hotel!	I read the reviews of this hotel before I left the United States and was very concerned to the point of trying to change my reservations - I was plesantly surprized - a very nice place - While I agree the staff could be a bit more attentive -except for Gil who was very helping in getting us around - overall - the place was nice....I agree the place is noisy but you are in downtown london - overall, I think folks coming here looking for the typical high rise hilton experince might be disappointed - it acts more like a small uk botique hotel - they would benefit from installing more permanent aircon but the stand alone units work fine.Bottomline - the location is fantastic -the green park tube station very close - one thing not mentioned in many of these reviews is the wonderful street right behind the Hilton, Shepard's Market - there are 6-10 fantastic restuarants right around the corner - Again, keep in mind, this is not a five star hotel but they work hard, breakfasts are great. Try to getting the highest floor possible or a rear facing room - should cut down on the noise -I really think the reviewers are being too harsh -this is a nice place to stay!Cheers -"
62,799,"Jul 15 2008 	very bad experience	Not a pleasant stay. After a long day of site seeing - came back to the room - large wet urine smelling stain on bed. They made no apologies - sent someone to eventually change the bedding. Needed to book a ride to the airport - the conceirge handed us the yellow pages - offered absolutely no help. Did not open a door, nor hail a taxi. Find a different place to stay - this one is not worth the money"
63,799,"Jul 13 2008 	Adequate for 1 night but noisy!	Just returned from one night stay at this hotel with my daughter as we were seeing a London show. Read the reviews before we went but went with open mind. As previous reviews have mentioned the hotel is very convenient for tube station. Found the room to be fine,everything you could need. Can't understand why people moan about size of room, what do they want to do in there!!? Not much of a view we were facing the street. Main problem was at 3.45 a.m. when council lorry came to collect bottles/glasssware etc from somewhere below us. What a row! It was absolutley disgusting. Make sure you ask for room facing away from street, I am sure that wouldn't be so bad. It was also hot in there. Even if we had decided to close the windows the ac pipe would have prevented us from closing both. The breakfast was very nice plenty to choose from there. Staff that we encountered were all very pleasant. All in all good choice for one night but maybe not any longer."
64,799,"Jul 12 2008 	Still Wonderful	We love this hotel. We had an extended stay in 2007 and had a wonderful time. This year we stayed for one night before our flight home (we were traveling around GB). It was like coming home when we walked in the door. My husband was greeted by name before we even got to the desk to check in. Our room was upgraded and it was huge even by US standards. It had been recently redone with new furniture, big screen TV, pristine bathroom. Two floor to ceiling windows over looked Half Moon St. The free standing air unit kept the room almost too cool. We walked to Buckingham Palace and strolled back through Green Park taking time to sit and people watch. The concierge let us log in on his computer to print out our boarding passes for our flight home. The hotel bar was as cozy &amp; comfortable as we remembered. We had a fabulous dinner in Shepherd Market at the The Market Brasserieperfection. Breakfast was well prepared and fresh and delicious. We were sad as we got in our cab to leave. Incidentally the doorman ran down to the corner to flag down a cab for us. Service with a smile and a great location!"
65,799,"Jul 12 2008 	great location but don't stay here	We recently stayed here for one night after returning from a cruise. The location is excellent-wallking distance from the tube-GREEN PARK. However, the hotel does not resemble a Hilton in quality. Our room which was supposed to be 2 double beds was one bed and small. We had to then book another room to accomodate our party. The room cost $500 and did not have air conditioning. There are many better choices in London. I would not recommend or ever stay here again."
66,799,"Jul 2 2008 	Skip it	This hotel should *not* have the Hilton name on it. I'm a Diamond member and was appalled at the size of the rooms, service oversights and poor attention to detail. I stayed for one week on business and can report: no aircon (portable units only), uncomfy bed (not to Hilton standards), stained sheets most nights and no topsheet on 5th night, never a morning newspaper despite promise that it would be there, dirty carpet, dormitory-quality hallways, roach in breakfast room (didn't return for meals after that!), dead rat outside front door on street, non-stop smoker nextdoor despite sign that it is AGAINST THE LAW (and no staff in sight after midnight to care or stop him), smoke detector was set off by the steam from a 10-minute shower, only one bar of soap and no soapdish (c'mon, gimme something to put it on/in!), scratchy thin towels, shower curtain didn't contain water and slippers literally floated away, rocking toilet, no internet in either of the 2 rooms i tried (despite hours of help from onsite and phone tech support), laundry delivered later than promised with no apologies (had to argue to get it removed from bill). There's probably more but you should get the picture. I wish I could say something nice because I am usually enthusiastic about Hilton properties. But the only positive thing about this hotel is the location -- steps from Green Park and the tube. I probably would have been happier sleeping in the park or on a train. :)"
67,799,"Jun 7 2008 	great location	Stayed here for 1 night. The location is great and although the rooms were small they were clean and comfortable. No air con, but don't always expect that in UK, especially for a London hotel in this price range (we paid 100 for 2 peopole in a double room). We were suprised that we could not get a coffee from the bar at 11.40pm as they had &quot;already cleaned the coffee machine&quot;. Also no room service after 11pm and nothing nearby for a snack.As we had not eaten since lunch we were certainly ready for and not disappointed with breakfast the next morning. Set us up for the rest of the day!Perfect location for a 1 or 2 night stay for sighteeing, but not in the height of summer."
68,799,"Jun 1 2008 	Location isn't everything	The location of this hotel is great and the staff was very friendly and as helpful as they could be. However, the room (a deluxe double) was very disappointing. When we arrived, the temperature was pushing 100 as the south facing drapes were open, and the PORTABLE A/C was not on as the window was stuck shut, and the exhaust hose had nowhere to go. We finally got the window open with our own pliers before a staff person arrived and turned on the A/C. It did not cool the room by bedtime, and it was overly warm. Three times in the night it turned itself off with an alarm clock like beeping. The second night it stopped completely and we had to call the desk again. Also, the room was very inconveniently arranged with too much furniture in too small of a space. The toilet rocked because it was not completely attached to the floor and the shower head pointed either at the wall or at the curtain. The Park Lane Hilton, which is only a few blocks away is a much better choice."
69,799,"May 26 2008 	Great location awful room	There is no doubting the usefulness of the location. Across the road from Green Park, itself a pleasant stroll to Buck House and Whitehall. But the room was pokey, without air con, and positively stifling. Opening the window wasn't an option as the next room was filled with drunken Russians listening to Radio 1. The bed was too small for me (6'4&quot;, but few problems elsewhere!), and I got absolutely no sleep. When work intervened in the length of my stay, I was delighted!Breakfast is v. good, but the once stylish Hilton brand has degenerated as far as the tacky heiress who now bears its name. Like the Holiday Inn without the cheer."
70,799,"May 21 2008 	Great Location! Very Small Accomodation!	Awesome Location! Steps away from Picadilly Circus and Buckingham Palace. Perfect location to the nightlife, green park, convenient stores, cafe, restaurants, etc.Don't get caught parking at the hotel- 40 per night! Parking is free on the street from 6pm to 8am!!! The rooms are VERY small (by North American standards). 1st room we were given had a step down to the washroom, a 37&quot; flat screen on top of a dresser!?!?! and a queen size bed that looked like a king size squeeze into a hallway!The food at the hotel is excellent, the bar &amp; restaurant area is spacious and comfortable.The staff was just manificient! They had no problem relocating us to a bigger room- (3yr old son, couldn't even move around the 1st room).Recommended, but the room areas are quite 'cozy'Neil- Toronto, Ontario"
71,799,"May 9 2008	Pleasant Surprise	Stayed at the Hilton London Green Park for a three day holiday. I was pleasantly surpised by the hotel, it's staff, and location. This particular Hilton is a boutique class hotel and is far better than many of it's peers. The room types are either two twin beds or one double bed. (Maybe not the choice for a family vacation to share a room.) The location is roughly three blocks from the Green Park tube station and located in the prestigious Mayfair district. (only a short distance from the Ritz Carlton) The staff was very friendly and helpful with getting around the city. The rooms are not as posh as your typical Hilton, but for 119 pounds a night you can't find better. If you are looking for a hotel at a reasonable price and great location...don't look any further. I will stay at this hotel every time I visit London and would definitely recommend it to others."
72,799,"May 6 2008 	Great Hotel Great Location	This hotel is in a great location. We stayed here for the original Hyde Park Calling in 2006 and it was literally 10 minutes walk away. In addition, it is 10 minutes walk from various places such as the West End, Buckingham Palace and about 15 minutes from Oxford Street.The hotel was clean and the staff very helpful, especially the concierge and the barman who stayed up until 5.30 in the morning serving us and about 20 other party-goers when we had a very boozy night in there!!The rooms were clean, however, we did have to ask to be moved as the first room we were given overlooked air conditioning units from the bar behind the hotel and consequently, we had to keep the windows shut to reduce the noise. The next room was on the 3rd floor, larger, lighter and had a bigger bathroom which all round was a bonus.Breakfast was great with something to suit everyone.To sum, a great base for London and only 2 minutes walk from the Hard Rock cafe and their pulled pork sandwiches!!"
73,799,"Apr 24 2008 	Hothouse	This Hilton sits on a side road across from Green Park and just around the corner from the nice eateries of Shepherd's Market. So location is very good, and it is a five minute walk from the Green Road Underground, so one can easily get from all airports to the hotel just by Underground and a brief walk. Mayfair is a great area to stay in, but be careful of this place!We stayed in an upgraded room, and it was hot, with no way at all to control the temperature. The windows opened a little, but just did not help. The heat came out of the ceiling vent, and the bathroom was unbearable. The fan in the closet was broken. But everyone was very friendly and acknowledged that it was a bit hot. And a bit run down. And the concierge could not give good advice, When asked where to get a train to Brighton, he suggested several Underground stops, one of which you could not get a train to Brighton from. This is unforgiveable especially when you drag luggage up and own stairs and end up somewhere you do not want to go,Little things here seem a problem. NO newspaper even though we were promised one. Very expensive breakfast....but go around the corner to Shepherd's Market for many lower cost but very good alternatives.Overall, stay here for the location, pay alot for that, and do not expect the normal Hilton experience."
74,799,"Apr 22 2008 	Last time @ Hilton Green Park	Have stayed at the Hilton Green Park on several occasions for business. The rates are always competitive and the staff are generally helpful, but the rooms are cramped, noisy, and uncomfortable. Each time I stay I vow it will be my last. The convenience always brings me back. This last stay was it. The mattress on the bed was ancient, could feel the springs. Every morning at 7am I could hear the janitor bang the door and fill up a bucket of water. Anyone walking down the hall reverberated through the walls. Slamming doors and noise from the elevators was a constant. Next time I will be going back to Le Meridien Piccadilly, worth the extra GBP."
75,799,"Mar 26 2008 	Nice Hotel	Stayed there for one night in March08. I was pleasantly surprised to get an upgrade to Deluxe room plus a complimentary bottle of red wine and an assortment of fruits waiting in the room. Im only a mid-level Hilton Honors member (Gold) so Im really not used to being treated with welcoming wine bottle. This happens maybe once every two years (and I am staying in quite a number of Hilton group hotels over the year). Room was quite big (for London standards), including rather spacious bathroom. Room quite recently completely renovated, as was the rest of the hotel. There were some marks and stains from usage, but overall impression was still a good one. All the basic equipment found in the room, from flat-screen TV to ironing board. Didnt find WLAN though. Lovely old London style narrow corridors and squeaky floorboards indicating an old building, you dont get that anywhere else than in London :-) Nicely located near Royal gardens, even though theres no direct line of view. View from my 4th floor room was directly to another building across the narrow street, but in London Im not really expecting anything else. Location is good, plenty of seeing and doing in the walking distance. Tube station almost around the corner. Big Ben is only one tube stop away! Breakfast was good, lots of variety (unlike normal London hotels). Cannot comment about restaurant or room service quality since didnt try them. No executive floor for Hilton Honor members in this hotel. Would I return there? Yes, absolutely. Price seems to be normally a bit steep though, so have to hunt for bargains"
76,799,"Mar 2 2008 	Disappointing Room	Unlike other Hilton hotels, this one is unable to follow simple instructions made during the booking. This has happened to me on other stays and I have now given up!The room I stayed in was small and overlooked a noisy road - and was dreadful value for money.Most Hilton's are great - this one most certainly is not. I can only assume that they get so much local business they feel they do not need to try."
77,799,"Jan 31 2008 	A small Hilton - A nice change from the normal	I stayed at this hotel on business in early January 2008. It was nice to stay at a Hilton that was smaller than the normal Hilton hotels. Almost felt like a more family run hotel. It's situation was close to the London Underground (Green Park on the Victoria Line) so it made it very handy for most locations in London, but on a quite road. It did not have an Executive Lounge, which I am used to in Hilton's but it had a very nice bar. I eat in the bar on both nights of my stay and it again felt more of a family run bar than the business Hilton hotel I have stayed in previously in London. The bar food was of a good standard too. There was a resturant but I was happy to sit in the bar on both evenings.The rooms were again of a high standard and typical of the Hilton chain of hotels. As I work for a company with offices in Victoria, London, I would not hestiate at staying at this hotel again."
78,799,"Jan 21 2008 	return visitors	My husband and I have stayed here a couple of times, It is smaller and more intimate than the larger park lane around the corner, the rooms are warm, but if you turn the radiator off as soon as you arrive it cools down quite quickly, The location is great and the breakfast is wonderful, everyone is helpful and friendly even when you are on your sixth bowl of bar nibbles!! And the evening meals are beautifully cooked and well presented, This is a place where the pace is unhurried and you can completely relax, we are off again in a few weeks and cant wait!!"
79,799,"Jan 12 2008 	very good hotel	stayed 5 nights last week and have booked another 3 weeks at 4 nights each week for the rest of Jan 2008. I was very concerned given other reviews I had read beforehand but these reviews are very misleading. Hotel is all non-smoking now. My room was a double with small floor space but expected given it is an old Victorian building in London. Sufficient space to walk round each side of the bed with modern furniture, a very large flat screen tV (wall mounted); the bathroom is OK - white suite and has standard Hilton amenitiies. Breakfast choice was very impressive!! I could not fault the choice of hot cooked or cold options lots of fruit choice, cereal etc. Hotel location is great for tube (/metro) access and there are several local restaurants and pubs within 100 yards - Italian, French and an excellent bistro a 10 min walk - called Richoux on South Audley St. Our US visitors would find this hotel 'cramped' but remember it is central London and old buildings to us are pre-1900 not 21st century modern/large etc so it is full of charm and character. Staff are very helpful and friendly."
80,799,"Jan 7 2008 	location and value	My wife and I stayed here for a weekend shopping break, I studied as usual all the comments on this site before booking and can agree that the rooms are small, there is no aircon and certain areas would not reach the advertised standard, however overall for the price we paid, 198 for two nights with dinner on one night, breakfast on two mornings I dont think anyone would argue that given the hotels almost perfect (for shopping) location there is better value anywhere in London.We are fairly seasoned travellers and have been to London numerous times, this is a Hotel that is unbeatable in terms of value for money"
81,799,Jan 1 2008	Warning: Hotel has no Air Conditioning or ventilation	We stayed at the Hilton Green Park in June of 2006. At the time of our visit London was experiencing an unusual heat wave. When we checked into our room it was sweltering. We looked for the AC controls. Finding none we called the front desk to inquire. They offered to send someone up. When the employee came he pulled a small (24&quot;) tower fan out of the closet and explained that the hotel had no AC. The lack of AC was made worse by the fact that the room had one window opening onto other buildings windows. When we left the room for the day in the morning we closed the window shade to prevent the room from getting sun all day. When we returned at 7pm the shade had been rolled up by the maid and the room was unbearable. We asked the front desk to relay this to the maid staff and left a note for the maid on the shade; all to no avail as every day we would lower shade when we left and every day it would be raised completely and the room of an unbearable temperature. During our stay we were forced to stay out until 10 pm (when the sun was down) before we could return to our room. We never slept well due to the intense heat and no ventilation. Many guests were checking out early due to the room heat. This is not a hotel to book in advance for summer months in the event there is a heat wave at the time of your stay.
82,799,"Dec 19 2007 	Nosiest hotel i've ever stayed in	I stayed one night in the Hilton Green Park. Due to being a HHonors Gold card holder I was told i was being upgraded to a Deluxe room ... i would have hate to have seen the standard room.The room was tiny and boiling hot (no air-con). There was no mini-bar and the bathroom looked like it hadn't been upgraded since the 70s.The bed was comfy and complementary water (quite warm water) was provided.The main problem with this hotel is that the floors, walls etc are paper thin. I didn't have to get up early but i was awake from 6am with banging, crashing, shouting from staff. The walls are thin but the staff had no sensitivity to the fact they were working in hotel corridors where people were trying to sleep. I finally gave up trying to sleep around 8am when some drilling started outside my room!On the positive side the location is very central and the price was competative (for December in central London). But i would not stay here again."
83,799,"Dec 12 2007 	The Good The Bad and The Ugly	After reading numerous reviews on this hotel before travelling, I really was HOPING it would be better than expected. We've traveled to London before so I knew to expect small rooms, narrow hallways, and tiny elevators.... but this was a total disappointment.The Good: The location is excellent. You can walk to many key places from here. Shepherd's market was a nice convenience on eating options late at night. We LOVED the location. Our room was clean and in good condition. The bathroom and toiletries were also adequate. Breakfast was superb.The Bad: The odd stairs and sloping floors I expected because of the reviews. But the floors actually dip and have soft spots that can trip up even the sturdiest youth. The walls are thin, and we heard people talking in the hallways, and could hear guests in the room above us walking around. The Ugly: This hotel is designated as a non-smoking hotel. What a joke. The halls reek of smoke. It's in the very fiber of the walls and floors. At night I woke up three times thinking the building was on fire only to realize smoke was seeping into the room under the door. Then it occurred to me that people were probably going into the halls to smoke late at night rather than go out into the cold and the rain. It was not pleasant.The Extra: When we arrived we were greet warmly by a friendly staff. We had requested a deluxe large room since our 9 year old was with us. We were given room 129. Don't ever take this room. It was so small that we had to turn sideways to get around the bed. My daughter and I both banged our shins several times. My husband went to the desk and requested a larger room.... stating we booked a deluxe size room. By the time we left the hotel after 2 nights we were sick of hearing &quot;I'm sorry sir...but....&quot; They promised to deliver a small bed to the room for our daughter. We both busted out laughing. We could barely get ourselves and our luggage in the room - there was NO WAY a bed was going to fit. They apologized, comped breafast for the next morning and promised to move us. Now, if you've read any older reviews you will know there is a lovely view of a brick wall. This room has it! I actually laughed when we opened the curtain to a big gray cinderblock wall. Not to mention a glance to the right looked right into the window of the next room down. The 3 of us crammed into one queen size bed for the night - to tired to fight with the staff anymore. The next morning after breakfast they moved us to room 108. What a difference!!! This one looked out the front windows. It had tall ceilings, 2 sets of french door/windows, a sitting area, a chaise lounge, flat screen tv, and was very roomy. We were delighted! The only downside was the smoke coming in from the hallway at night. My summary. Don't take your kids to this hotel. It's probably perfect for a young couple who will spend more time out on the town than in the hotel."
84,799,"Dec 2 2007 	So fun and friendly!	I only stayed in this hotel for two nights, but I experienced the utmost comfort and courtesy! Even the smallest room has a large bath and comfortable bed. Any information I needed from the concierge was immediately available, 24/7. The whole staff are warm, friendly, and eager to help. If you have the opportunity, you should definitely stay here! It's only a block away from the piccadily line, a stopping point for many fun locations."
85,799,"Nov 24 2007 	Great Location	Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Green Park. The location was excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful. We got a cheap deal at the last minute and paid 63 a night, mid week, not including breakfast. If we had paid the full price, I guess we'd have been a little dissappointed, but we couldn't ask for more at the price we paid. I think we got upgraded to a larger room, prior to arrival, so the room was spacious and the decor modern, with a view over the quiet (for London) street. Our only negative comments are that some of the linen was stained and the walls and door frames in our room were very scuffed and flaky in places and could do with a repaint (everything else in the room seemed really new, so I don't know why they didn't paint the woodwork and walls at the time of the refurb). If you get a cheap deal, then I would definitely recommend this hotel."
86,799,"Oct 28 2007 	Not your Hilton class	The staff was nice and the location of the hotel is wonderfull. Nevertheless, if you are expecting to experience of good quality you may be disapointed. The hotel is located in old building, but that not explain dirty carpeting, holes in towels and dirty gray window treatments. First we've got the room at the ground facing the street, the noice was not acceptable, so we switched to the back room next to staircase that everyone used because elevatyors are very slow or not all of them working. Also we got charged $48 for 3 minute phone call to the London area cell phone. There is no free internet service in the hotel and such service actually cost $30 for one day use...uneceptable. The hotel was very pricey and the price did not reflect the services and accomodation...very disapointing."
87,799,"Oct 24 2007 	Handy for the buses	Good location for public transport and walking to numerous sites, on a quiet (for London) side street. Staff friendly, helpful and numerous. Bedroom very small, very dark, little drawer space, large TV. Bathroom OK, &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; towel policy negated by constantly replacing part-used toiletries. Breakfasts very good, large choice but no variation, twice in four days had to wait (up to 15 min) for a table but efficiently managed by head waiter. Dinners also very good (albeit overpriced but what hotel in London isn't) and adaptable to special diet. Just one minute walk away is an area called Shepherd Market, no market but 6 to 8 restaurants offering better value meals, we had an excellent dinner at Sofra, a turkish place very busy and friendly and also able to do a special menu."
88,799,"Oct 24 2007 	Mildly disappointing for the money	Stayed 1 night at the Hilton Green Park in London's Mayfair neighborhood. Quick review...THE GOOD:--Service was excellent all around, I was treated very well.--Location is great, lots to see and do in the area (though I was there on biz)THE BAD:--I was upgraded to their highest level room, and yet, it was a big disappointment. Floors were oddly sloping and uneven with soft spots,shower was laughably narrow, furniture was chintzy, walls VERY thin, and the room wasn't terribly clean.--Internet access costs more than $30 a dayGiven that I paid around 250GBP (around $550 USD at this time), I'd expect a lot more. Small rooms and limited services I'd expect in London, but the other stuff I don't. The place needs an upgrade on the rooms, and they should be embarrassed to charge that much for internet access."
89,799,"Oct 5 2007 	great location at the hilton green park	my husband and i stayed at this hotel from friday to sunday and got a good deal booking with the hotel directly which included buffett breakfast which was absolutely fantastic and 1st night evening meal which was also very good and quite alot of choice, the drinks are very expensive!! the staff were very helpful indeed. our hotel room was on the 1st floor a guestroom double which didn't have a very good view at all, but was nice, clean &amp; comfortable. it was our wedding anniversary while we were there, i mentioned this when booking and a complimentory bottle of wine was sent up to us just after arriving!!the location though is fantastic,and alot of sights within walking distance, or tube ride, green park tube station is a 2 minute walk away."
90,799,"Sep 20 2007	Great location upgrade your room for sure!	The location is great, right across from Green Park and walking distance to Buckingham Palace. The lobby is very small, staff friendly. I was first placed in a room that was on the ground floor, all the way to the back of the property, and up a strange set of stairs. This room was horrible, too small to move around, closet bathroom, no air. I was over a construction site and a bar, sleep was impossible the first night. The next day I was moved to a nice room on the 3rd floor near the elevator - what a difference! Much bigger room, queen bed, large bathroom, night and day. Definitely upgrade your room or you will be miserable."
91,799,"Aug 28 2007 	Great Location	Try and avoid room 127 - very small single and a view of a concrete wall, and no sunlight so the room is in darkness all the time. However a super team of staff and a great location."
92,799,"Aug 26 2007 	Way Below Hilton standards	When I checked into my room I could not believe that Hilton would actually put their name on this hotel. I had received a roon upgrade at check in, but even my upgraded room was well below the standard that you would expect from a Hilton.The rooms had no air conditioning, and the decor and furniture seemed very cheap. The rooms were small, but that is expected in London. I have stayed in another Hilton hotel with even smaller rooms, but those room were still of a much higher caliber than those at Green Park.My room was quiet,clean, and the hotel provided a decent breakfast. Location was good, but I would definitely hesitate staying here again unless the hotel goes through a major refurbishment of their rooms and airconditioning."
93,799,"Aug 17 2007 	Good location but I wouldn't stay here again	Nice location, just off Green Park, near the Underground. Staff were also very good, but I was not very impressed. Very small rooms (single beds!) with no A/C or bathroom fans. There was also construction right outside my window, so there was no sleeping in. Last, there was next to no TV channels, so if you are like me and up at night getting used to the time difference, I hope you like soccer...sorry, football. It was clean, so no major complaints, but there is better value for your money out there."
94,799,"Aug 13 2007 	A really good stay	We booked to stay at Green Park and mixed feeling's due to the reviews we have read. But on arrival we were shown two rooms and chose 343 which was very accomodating but as other people have said there is no A/C so very hot, but saying that we had a comfortable stay.The bathroom window overlooked the old Tavern Ye Grapes and was noisy but only for the Friday night and that was only untill 11.30pm.You will not get view in this hotel as it is down a side street but for location you cant beat it.If you have not got breakfast in you deal dont spend the 20 as there are a lot of eating places nearby example Katies full breakfast 4.We ate in the hotel restaurant on the 1st night and the food was excellent and being a hilton member I used my loyalty card for 50% off on the food but the drink was anothr matter 2 spritzers 16 well overpriced and they automatically take 10% for service. If you are looking for a cheaper drink look for Samuel Pepy's just around the corner from Tesco's.Saying that we would stay here again the staff are lovely."
95,799,"Jul 29 2007 	Good all round hotel	The best way to describe this hotel is there is nothing truly outstanding that makes you go wow, instead they do everything very well. We had two interconnecting rooms for three nights for a family of four. The children aged 9 &amp; 11 had to share a queen size bed even though two singles were requested. Our room had a king bed with a small two seater lounge. The childrens room had hardly any furniture and i thought our room had too much to the point that we moved it out of the way. The rooms were immaculately clean though there were some stains on the lounge. Both rooms had fantastic Plasma TV's and reasonably modern furniture. The bathrooms were a good size. The only fault with the rooms is there is no airconditioning (central heating in every room). We had a portable aircon unit that was new but took up awkward space and was rather noisy. Other than that the rooms were more than adequate. Breakfast was included in our room rate. We all absolutely loved the breakfast. Full english buffet. No complaints at all about breakfast, extremely well done. The staff were very helpfull especially the concierge who seemed to know the answer to every question including bus routes, tube stations, theatres the lot. This was very helpful. There was a mix up on check in with our reservation and only one room was reserved yet four persons was noted on our reservation with interconnecting rooms requested. Since we arrived lunchtime this couldn't be sorted until after normal check in time, this was not a concern to us. the hotel provided luggage storage and dual key safe facilities until we returned. We required a late 6pm checkout on our final day. The hotel offered us an extremely reasonable hourly rate until our departure. Location is 50 metres off Picadilly and about a three minute walk to Green Park tube station. Would definitely stay again."
96,799,"Jul 9 2007 	Worst Hilton ever!	Good location this may be, but an experience I would happily have missed. I'm a Gold HHonors member and booked two reward rooms at Green Park for a holiday break with family - unfortunately therefore not changeable, or I would have been out in a flash. Despite the Gold membership (supposed to give you upgraded rooms) the first room we were shown was dark, tiny,and on the first floor facing a working demolition site, with dust flying through the open window. Luckily the porter warned us on the way up about the construction! We were then moved to street facing rooms. Because of the different levels in the building a good portion of the room was taken up with stairs down from corridor level. There was just enough space to get round the bed, but &quot;cat swinging&quot; would have been impossible. The hotel had thoughtfully provided rubber guards on the exposed ends of the bed, as it was impossible not to knock your legs on the way past - an admission of defaet if ever there was one. A postage stamp bathroom had not even an extractor fan, never mind a window. The furniture looked like they bought up a bunch of Ikea rejects - a small desk which opens up to a dressing table mirror belongs in a boarding school, not a Mayfair hotel. No room to unpack into a three foot wide cupboard with one shelf, and not enough room for two suitcases to stand - the room may have done at a pinch for one adult, but was very uncomfortable for two. No airconditioning, London summer humidity and double glazing made the room like a sauna, day and night. An electric fan unit stacked into the cupboard worked only on one setting as the remote needed to operate it had no batteries, but was so noisy that you may as well have stayed at Heathrow. The worst part of it all was not directly the hotel's fault - after the traffic congestion charge ends at 6pm, the street outside turns into a short-cut racetrack for half of London cabs and cars, and particularly the Mayfair and Park Lane Maserati brigade, who accelarate as fast as possible from Picadilly past the windows. The problem was that with no aircon, the choice was living through the Grand Prix all night with a window open, in order to get some air in the room, or broil . Service was very patchy - the porters and concierge were excellent, front desk staff defensive and not very helpful (but probably exhausted by the many complaints which we overheard) and the bar staff downright rude. The only good thing - the breakfast buffet, which was world class. Never again, if you're determined to stay in a London Hilton, head for the Trafalgar or Paddington."
97,799,"Jun 25 2007 	Sub Standard Hilton Property	One star rating. Only positive and it is a minor positive is proximity to the West End and notice I say proximity as opposed to location.Checked into room 433, was told this was an upgrade.Outside the window of this room is a wall, you can see nothing but the wall, not that I imagine the view from of the front of the property is any better as this over looks another hotel. Billed as the Hilton Green Park I envisaged views over the park. They should call this hotel Hilton Piccadilly as this is a more acurate description of its location. The property is very tired as is the attitude of the staff. This hotel is in decline, it needs to be shut and refurbished. With the staff retrainedThe beds and the other furniture within the room have seen better days.There are much better hotels in the area for a lot less money and I will use one of these in the future. I regularly stay in Hilton Hotels (Diamond) and this is the second worse Hilton I have stayed in. The other is now no longer a Hilton (Manama, Bahrain) so there fore technically this makes this the worst.At over two hundred pounds a night it must have been Dick Turpin stood behind the counter because I was robbed.I could have chatted to the previous occupant of the room as most of him/her was still in the bath.Stay here if location is important and money and cleanliness is not."
98,799,"Jun 15 2007 	Location is about the only good thing!	This hotel has a great location, but that's about it! We booked three rooms in this hotel, all of which were extremely dusty and needed the carpets cleaned. After the first night, several of us developed a cough from the dust in our rooms. Additionally, this hotel does not have central air conditioning in the guest rooms, so the staff brings in a large unit that sits on the floor and is vented out the window, keeping the window open all of the time. This is an old hotel, with uneven, creaky floors, so that you can hear anyone walking by your room. We were extremely disappointed and would not stay here again."
99,799,"Jun 2 2007 	Clean and Comfortable Base in Central Location	Hotel is situated in a quiet street just off Picadilly. I stayed one night in May 2007 and was more than happy with the service. Rooms are clean and comfortable with modern decor. My room, a single, although quite small, had all amenties listed (except a Sony Playstation!) There is a bar and restaurant on site and the Hark Rock Cafe is just around the corner!Central location to explore London. A short walk past the Ritz Hotel takes you to Picadilly Circus, Regent St and Oxford St - a shoppers paradise! Hyde Park is close by and the upmarket Knightsbridge with Harrods and Harvey Nichols is a 10 min walk.A great base!"
100,799,"May 29 2007 	No room for your clothes.	A reasonable hotel, although we were on the fourth floor and there were four steps from the door of the room and bathroom up to the room itself, not suitable if you are old or infirm. The room was also quite small, and very little wardrobe/ clothes space. Also no air conditioning so beware in the summer.Breakfast and evening meals were good,and service excellent."
101,799,"May 26 2007 	Modern clean and a great location	I stay in London almost every week and I'm always on the look out for good value hotels. This hotel is very centrally located, spotlessly clean with modern fittings and decor. I got a very good price - about 135 p/night but it included dinner and breakfast. I was told by reception I couldn't get my dinner as room service, but when I went to the restaurant they told me this wasn't a problem - they need to get their stories straight! I was charged 3.50 to have it delivered - not a problem. The room I got was on the ground floor overlooking several heating units and looking straight into the windows of other rooms, but for the price, I wasn't expecting anything else. I would say though that if the weather had been particularly hot, the lack of air con would have made the room very uncomfortable. There was quite a bit of noise from local bars which is a problem if you need to keep the window open. I suggest when you check in, you ask for a room on the higher floors."
102,799,May 10 2007 	Just okay...nothing special	The hotel was just okay but certainly can do much better in London. It is right across from St. James Park and close walking distance to a few sites but it certainly wasn't anything that stood out. We got a pretty good rate because we booked in advance but when we wanted to add a night they wanted to charged us 200 pounds. There is no way the hotel was worth 200 pounds a night. The breakfast was fantastic but if you pay the menu price- its ridiculous because there are other great options just a short distance away for 5 pounds.
103,799,Feb 25 2007 	Good location but nothing great	I spent 7 days at the Hilton Green Park for Business. The hotel staff was very nice and they were able to check me in early which was very nice. The hotel is down a side street which is very nice because you don't get much traffic. The lobby is very small but it is very clean and nice. The elevators are incredibly small so if you are afraid of closed in spaces this is not the hotel for you. Once you get off the elevator and walk down the hall the first thing you notice is everything seems small. When you walk in your room you realize WOW everything is pretty small. Every review I had read prior to my trip said the seats in the hotel room had stains and guess what? Mine did as well and that had me laughing. The room was very small but it was good enough for me since this was a business trip. The bathroom was nice and the shower was very big and water was always hot. The bed was nice and big and the pillows were perfect for my head. The Bar and Restaurant were ok and I didnt have any meal that I could single out as great. The best part about this hotel is the location to all areas of London. If you are in London for a few days and want to see the sights this hotel is for you. You are going to pay a big price for an average hotel but this is London and you are going to pay anywhere.
104,799,"Feb 11 2007 	Great food and location room OK.	We stayed on a Hilton winter break for two for two nights with dinnerincluded on one of them all in for about 230. The location was excellent, close to the underground station and a very short walk from Buckingham Palace and Picadilly Circus. Not far from Oxford Street or Charing Cross. The food was excellent and the waiters were friendly and pleasant. The staff were generally great. The room was tidy, clean and fairly modern but not very spacious. That said, we didn't spend a lot of time in it.The hotel is down a side street so there were no noise problems from the London traffic.All in all we were very happy with our stay. The hotel doesn't have much in terms of facilities except the excellent restaurant. That said there is plenty to do nearby."
105,799,"Feb 2 2007 	Mayfair - almost	Location was great - one of the reasons for booking.Fabulous food. Staff very efficient rather than friendly, except for the waiting staff who went the extra mile. The room wasn't much to write home about - stain on the chaise longue and nothing but nets to cover the bathroom balcony window. Creaky floors too. Still, for the location and price it was a good deal and if you're after 5 star luxury there's always the Hilton Park Lane around the corner."
106,799,"Jan 31 2007	Good location so so hotel	I stayed here in early December and found the hotel to be decent. Actually, the location is all that makes it good; the hotel itself is nothing to write home about. It is very close to the bus and tube and easy walking distance to Piccadilly circus, Leicester Square, Buckingham palace, and most of the other central attractions. Because it was holiday season there were always people out and about, and even being alone I never felt unsafe, even walking back to the hotel at 3am! I stayed in 3 rooms over my stay, and all of them were small by American standards but decent for London, and quite clean. However, this hotel is historic meaning it is old and tired, even though they were doing restoration (I cant call it renovations because it seems like they were just painting and replacing carpet). The floors creak, the hallways are long and rambling, and even the double paned windows didnt quite keep out the street noise  although my second room was facing the back and was much quieter than the ones facing the street. I requested a non smoking room, and apparently they consider a room I wont be smoking in a non-smoking room. So, the first room I was placed in was on a smoking floor and the halls and room smelled horrible. When I complained they told me it was their biggest room. Whatever. Moved to a smaller room on a non-smoking floor which was much more pleasant, so if it matters to you make sure you specify that the whole floor should be non-smoking and not just the room while you are in it. The beds are quite comfortable, and the bathroom is decent sized with a combo bathtub/shower. The last room I was in (extended my stay so they moved me to another room, which was the smallest of the lot but still adequate), ehad problems with the shower curtain, and every time I took a shower water flooded all over the bathroom floor. At least there were enough towels to mop it up! Other reviews have mentioned this, but there is basically no way to control the heating in the rooms, and they kept the hotel excessively hot. Even though it was winter and cold outside, I would open up the windows for at least an hour before going to bed so I didnt sweat to death at night. The concierge was not even remotely helpful unless you knew exactly where you wanted to go and just wanted them to make reservations (and even then, they couldnt get you into popular places). I asked for a good Indian and was handed a restaurant guide. Totally not up to par with other hotel concierge services, in London or anywhere else in Europe.My rate didnt include breakfast so I didnt spend the money on it, with Starbucks and Pret right down the street. Shepherds Market is right around the corner and has wonderful reasonably (for London) priced restaurants. Still, for all of its flaws, I kind of liked the hotel, and just loved the location. If I got a reasonable rate I would stay here again with no hesitation."
107,799,"Jan 23 2007 	Put me off Hilton's	Myself, my boyfriend and two friends stayed at the Hilton Green Park for my Birthday. A friend booked it through a website for 100 each per night, this was a 'special deal' with a 'complimentary evening meal' on night of arrival and a 'complimentary' breakfast both mornings we were there. He chose a Hilton thinking it would be something special...not so.The receptionist didn't seem too friendly when we checked in. We arrived at 6.45 but the earliest evening meal booking they had for us was 9.30.The rooms were tiny and I banged my leg on the edge of the bed twice.They were clean rooms I can't fault that and if it was a case of 60 for the room and 40 for the food I wouldn't feel the need to write a bad review but I have stayed in much better hotels in London for less money. I don't think they should state that the food is complimentary when it's obviously included in the price.On the other hand, the food was excellent, the evening meal was delicious but then we did have to wait until 9.40 for our table to be ready even though it was virtually empty in the restaurant, so by the time we ate it was 10pm and we were all starving.Same with the breakfast, full buffet, anything you wanted, very nice, couldn't fault it.It was just the standard of room for the price we paid."
108,799,Jan 22 2007 	Good Stay Overall	We stayed between Dec 26 and 28 and the stay was pleasant. Check-in was easy (we arrived the hotel at 8:00am and they let us check-in early). Location is great and is close to bus and tube. Room is small but very clean. Breakfast was excellent. Our deal also included dinner on the first night and the meal was decent. We would consider staying there again on our next trip!
109,799,"Jan 6 2007 	Lovely Hotel great location but....	Don't drink in the hotel bar !!My husband &amp; I stayed here Dec 29th - 31st, got a great deal with londontown.com, 2 nights B&amp;B plus one evening meal for 198pounds inclusive, well worth the money, would not have eaten here otherwise, as breakfast was around 16 - 18 pounds, nice as it was , way to expensive.Checkin went very smoothly, staff, we found to be friendly &amp; helpful, our room was lovely, very clean &amp; modern. On arrival, as well as the usual tea/coffee making facilities, there was a beautiful fresh fruit tray in the room which had, banana, apples, oranges, strawberries, grapes &amp; star fruit, a really nice touch &amp; yummy. All in All we would stay here again, for all of the above, plus location, BUT definitly not for a drink !!!!! We invited friends for dinner &amp; drinks, met up with them, went to a bar close by for a drink before dinner, then headed to the Hotel , on arrival our table was not ready ( had to wait about 10 minutes ), so my husband ordered drinks, 1 whiskey &amp; coke , 1 vodka &amp; coke, 1 bacardi &amp; coke and a pint of beer, now in the bar we just left this cost around 14 pounds, in the Hilton Green Park this same order cost..........wait for it................. a few pence short of......30 POUNDS !!!! So beware, as much as we loved this hotel &amp; would not hesitate so stay there again, we would not be using the bar as I could never justify spending that amount of money on 4 drinks."
110,799,"Dec 2 2006	Super!	I booked this hotel from reading reviews on 'Trip Advisor' and comparing with others in the area - and by price. This wasn't the cheapest deal I could have found, but average for the time of year (20th Nov.). We stayed one night, but wish it could have been longer. Room was very clean, specifically bathroom which I think is beyond 'a must' as hotel accommodation goes. We had a street facing room, which wasn't a problem - you have to expect some noise in central London. The room wasn't small, neither the bathroom - much better than some &quot;couldn't swing a cat&quot; examples. Bed was comfy, seating adequate (one at desk/dressing table) and a large footstool type thing, not that that's important. If I were on business the desk would be a little on the small side, but not a crisis. A portable Air Con. unit was found in the wardrobe along with ironing board, iron, safe, usual laundry bits and extra linen/blanket. Lighting options were good. Toiletrees were by 'Crabtree &amp; Evelin' thus a nice quality and smelt rather good.Room service: quality/quantity of food was super, not overpriced but did take longer than the 20 minutes suggested by staff. Not a problem on this occassion.Location, as anticipated is EXCELLENT,close to lots of attractions, Green Park itself, shopping, tube connections (several), quiet (for London) and safe. Staff gave speedy service, were well informed, corteous, and offered good quality service. Will most certainly return - a credit to the Hilton chain!"
111,799,"Oct 27 2006	Decent accommodations fine location	Our room was large by European standards: a true double bed at one end, a sitting area -- with sofa, chair, TV set, and tables at the other. The bathroom was small, but included a tub/shower and many toiletries.The restaurant served a full breakfast at a high cost; it also offered lunch and dinner menus with rather good food. (Our first night coincided with the last night of a 'Malaysian Food Festival,' a buffet prepared or overseen by a chef from a Hilton in Malaysia. It was different, interesting, and delicious. The standard menu, a few nights later, was less interesting and less delicious.)"
112,799,"Sep 26 2006 	Hard to love easy to like	Now that the Trafalgar is getting too pricey for me, I decided to stay down the street at another Hilton. I stayed here for 3 weeks during the height of the summer heat wave. There are no permanent airconditioners in the hotel, but portable ones are avialable on request.Bar/lobby: traditional, clean, functional. Not air conditioned. Bar prices typical of hotels. Newspapers available.Restaurant: good variety of food, but typical hotel prices. Nice concept in style. I ate there three times and was happy with the food. I never had room service. The breakfast buffet is $$$, so go somewhere else for breakfast.Location: 5 minute walk to GreenPark tube station, 10 minute walk to Picadilly circus, the US Embassy (grovesnor square). 2 minute walk to the park to walk of your food (Buckingham Palace is at the opposite side), 5 minute walk to Bond street (luxury stores). The neighborhood is very upscale and you will find Bentlys and exotic cars commonplace - the Saudi Embassy is a 2-minute walk away.Concierge: I never used them, but were always present. Dry Cleaning: fast, good job, but they never got the starch instructions quite right...there is a dry cleaner across the street, but he doesnt do laundry.Food: a couple of grocery stores within 5 minute walk (tesco, M&amp;S). Many restaurants and pubs in Shepherds Market is right behind the hotel. Rooms: I stayed in 3 rooms over my stay, as I would take one-night jaunts over the weekends while there. Rooms are typical small London sizes. Every room had very poor TV reception and channel selection. Why they chose german infomercial channel to be one of the 10 stations you get is anybody's guess...definitely not 4 star material. The beds are comfortable with decent threadcount sheets. I never heard any of my neighboors, so the rooms are well insulated for noise. Not much streetnoise, but remember that if you suck in outside air for your AC unit, you will get more noise. The bathrooms were spacious, clean, well-light, but types of toilettries changed daily. Sometimes you get bodywash, sometimes you get moisturizer, but do get shampoo and soap everytime.The airconditioning is only an issue for 2-3 months in the summer. There are a limited amount of portable A/C units, so make sure you order one asap upon your arrival. The A/C units come with no instructions, so rely on your instincts. Also, they will turn off if you dont empty them of water. I hate it when it turned off in the middle of the night while I was asleep -- I woke up sweaty!I am thinking of trying the more modern Hilton Park Lane that is a 5 minute walk next time I go to London. Probably better for the business traveller, but not as romantic and quaint as the Green Park Hilton."
113,799,"Sep 16 2006 	Excellent location	Front desk staff was only slightly friendly. We always seemed to catch them at a bad time, no one seemed happy with their jobs. We had a problem with some changes that were made to the dates of our stay and it was a big ordeal to get it fixed.The concierge staff was great! Always willing to help point us in the right direction. Also, we were there when the unfortunate bomb plot incident happened, and they were more than happy to take us to the local Mail Boxes, Etc. around the corner and carry back our boxes! Not many people would do that! We were not thrilled w/the restaurant. Not much to choose from on the dinner menu, and the English Breakfast was a bit over priced. Needless to say, we grabbed a quick bite at Starbucks or PRET to start our day.The location was excellent! A beautiful stroll through Green Park and there was Buckingham Palance. The tube station was just a couple blocks over and the bus was right across the street. We rode the tube just about everywhere. I highly recommend getting an Oyster card! It's worth every penny!The rooms were nice. There were 3 of us travelling. Unfortunately no adjoining rooms, but luckily they were on the same floor at least. One with a double bed, very nice sized room! The other was 2 single beds. A litte small, but certainly a nice place to hang your hat at night. Bathrooms were nice, the only annoyance was the light switch being on the outside of the bathroom. No a/c in the shared room, but we did have a fan so that helped. The single room had a big a/c unit.There was some construction work going on while we were there. Windows were being replaced to double pane windows, so it was very loud very early in the morning. One good thing about that, we weren't able to waste the day sleeping! Too much to see and do!Overall, good experience. Would probably stay there again, mainly for location."
114,799,"Sep 13 2006 	Great location AC only available in King size rooms	The Bad:If you need Air Conditioning then you have to book a King size room to get one of the few portable AC units. There is only 1 ice machine in the hotel hidden on the 3rd floor. Hallways have lots of weird short stairs that go up a couple of steps and then back down a few steps later so anyone with walking problems should avoid any room not on the gorund floor. Take the small slow elevators because the stairwells are down right scary (kind of an outdoor stairwell with tin metal sheeting and no lighting).Hotel claims to be non-smoking, but there are no signs telling folks to refrain from smoking. My family put up with neighbors cigarette smoke, but called the front desk when they lit up stoggies (cigars). Staff did nothing other than tell me the room number of the offender and say they had called and left notes but no one answered (LAME). Damp towels under the door, making coffee to smell something else and opening the windows helped us get thru the nights.If small rooms or smoking bothers you then you should stay at the newer Hitlon on Park Lane a few blocks away. The Good:Was able to cut the price by booking first night with Hiton and the rest of the week with Expedia (Expedia said it was full if I tried to book the entire week). Opted for non-breakfast booking, but ended up being told breakfast was free anyways when we got there (great breakfast buffet).Hilton Green Park is in one of London's most desirable neighborhoods, the May Fair. It is one block from Green Park, one of the 3 largest green spaces in London, and a pleasant walk to Buckingham Palace. It has a underground tube stop just 3 blocks away.Starbucks and a Mark and Spencers grab and go food store 1 block away. So getting coffee and cheap internet access is close at hand.Coin laundromat to do your washing cheaper than the hotel is 2 stops away on the tube (Pimlico station on the Victoria line). Red &amp; White Laundries, 6 Lupus Street SW1V 3DY and another at 64 Lupus Street SW1V 3EQ"
115,799,"Jul 22 2006 	ok but not great	Pros: quiet neighborhood, great breakfastCons: no air conditioning, small roomsHilton Diamond member, family of four (two adults, two kids 5 and 10) stayed here (2 separate rooms) in July, during a serious heat wave. We sweltered, as the place didn't have any air conditioning. There was a snafu at checkin with a misplaced reservervation, but it was corrected on the spot. The hotel is near a subway line, Green Park (for the kids to run free), and had a good full English breakfast."
116,799,"Jul 9 2006	Bad hotel - great location	Excellent location but overpriced. We could manage with the small room, which was tastefully decorated, but no air conditioning was available - hotel provided a small fan. Only one window facing onto a noisy alley. Impossible to keep shower from flooding the bathroom and the towels we used to mop up the floor were later folded and replaced on the racks by housekeeping for reuse as if clean. This was our first and last visit to this hotel."
117,799,"Jul 6 2006	Not a Four Star	We are HiltonHonor Members and stayed here from 6-20-06 thru 6-23-06. The staff was helpful and check in went well. Upon check-in they were doing remodeling work in the lobby but did not think much of this. When we arrived to our room, it faced Half Moon Street, the French doors/windows did not open to let air in. The temperature was a pleasant 70 degreeduring our stay, so without the windows opening no air. There is no air conditioning in this hotel. There was mold around the bath tub, and in the corners of the bathroom. The door to the bathroom was on a spring and closed so we had to prop it open to get some light in there as there was only one light in there. The bed consisted of a mattress on some wooden boards, no spring. When we complained to the manager he said he would try to fix the windows, which he did but not until the next day. He also said he would try to upgrade our mattress, which he did not, He also told us he had some air conditioners and would try to get for our room. No air conditioner. The hotel is in a great location but if on vacation do not stay here."
118,799,"Jun 19 2006	Cramped	Other than location it would be hard to justify the cost of staying here. The rooms are cramped and by the time you have removed the ironing board, luggage rack, telephone directories there is scarcely room to swing the proverbial cat.The wardrobes are small as are the beds and the noise from the renovations to the building next door is horrendous ( not the Hilton's fault admittedlly), but we were not advised in advance. The window in the bathroom was cracked and the panel under the sink was held together by a series of sticky pads, not what youwould expect from a 4 star Hilton The food was good quality and well presented, we had some difficulty with the speed of service which the staff recognised by way of a complimentary drink. A &quot; discretionary &quot; service charge is applied even on drinks where you are at the bar so be aware of this extortionate add on.Not a hotel that I would recommend."
119,799,"Jun 18 2006	Good Location some issues	Great location however has some issues. No air-con although you can get a portable unit which is loud and big, however they only a few and on hot nights are all taken very quickly. If you need a good nights sleep, they provide a fan - which for a Hilton and at this price is just not acceptable. Rooms are small and stuffy but well presented. No room safes are in the rooms but you can lodge articles at the front desk which is a hassle. There is no gym (but there is a great park to run in at the end of the street) and lastly, the iron was faulty and when I asked for the front desk to have it fixed, no response whatsoever.Breakfast buffet was excellent and staff really good. . Actually all the staff were very friendly and very helpful which offset the above issues however as a business hotel should you need to get sleep and to make sure you look presentable in the morning, it is not geared up for this in a london summer. As a tourist hotel in the heart of London, great location."
120,799,"Jun 7 2006	Really Lovely Hotel	We stayed at this hotel during May for my birthday after getting a good deal from lastminute(-).The hotel is so close to the tube station which is really handy and when we arrived check in was very quick. The reception staff were very nice and asked if we were there for a special occasion, we replied that this was my birthday. When we got to the room we found a bottle of complimentary wine whichc was a really ncie touch.I found the hotel room to be pleasently decorated and actually alot nicer than some of the public areas.We really enjoyed our stay however this might be because we did get a great reduced rate, the full price does seem to be very expensive for what you actually get."
121,799,"May 29 2006	If this is the quaility for Honors members!	I have been an Hilton Honours member for 9 years and used to enjoy the stays accros the UK and Europe.I gave up staying about 18 months ago when the quaility and service started to drop.Having built up thousands of points i thought i would have a night in london and use some of the points.The Hilton in Half Moon Street Mayfair is a great location and close to all the sites. Check in is Ok but the room little bigger then the double bed (UK Double) dirty carpet poorly cleaned bathroom etc etc. Bearing in mind that Hilton Honours is the reward program for there regular guests i would of thought that they would at least ensure that on a reward night the room was of a resonable size, clean and inviting. (still, i should not complain i only spent approx 5000.00 with the Hilton group to earn enough points for this free(?) night)Apart from the location i can not think of any thing else to reccomend this hotel."
122,799,"May 28 2006	O.K. 4 Star Prices Not 4 star Quality.	We have just spent 6 nights at the Green Park Hilton in London. On a positive note, the hotel is very well positioned for all the sights of London, as the underground station at Green Park is only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. Buckingham Palace is about a half a miles straight walk across Green Park, and Piccadilly Circus, maybe a half an hours walk. Upon arrival at the hotel, our deluxe room was not available, so we were given complimentary breakfast which was excellent, and saved us 20 per person. However, the standard rooms we were given were overlooking Half Moon Street, and as the heating in the hotel was overpoweringly high, and could not be altered in the room, we attempted to open the windows. The windows would not stay open, and despite several requests for this to be corrected, six days later the windows had to be propped open with glasses from the bathroom. Unfortunately, as we had to have the windows open, the noise from Half Moon Street, throughout the night was often difficult to deal with. The rooms themselves were comfortable, but very, very small, even for London. The staff were very polite, but often unable to help. The restaurant staff particularly could often not understand requests as their English was inadequte. Maybe I would have had a different impression of the hotel if I had received a deluxe room. To summarise, I would have to say that the hotel does not, in my opinion come up to the 4 star standard that I have previously been accustomed to, but It is excellently placed for all the sights of London. However, the prices in the restauant and bar are very expensive, even for a 4 start hotel. I probably would not use this hotel again, if an alternative hotel were available nearby."
123,799,May 24 2006	Excellent location	We travelled to London on the 17th March for a 2 night stay with friends and booked the Hilton Green Park.We took the underground from Heathrow and got off at Green Park and the hotel was literally only a few minutes away - although our map reading skills left a lot to be desired and we were pointed in the right direction by a friendly doorman!!Upon arrival the check in was quick and hassle free and we were allocated our rooms. Our room was located on the ground floor on one of the wings. The room was large enough for us and clean and tidy. As per a previous review there was no minibar and to the best of my knowledge no vending machine for that late night soft drink - no way was I ordering room service for a coke!!Hotel is in a fabulous location with many attractions in walking distance. We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe on the Friday night and at a restaurant at Leicester Square on the Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised not to have to book and get a table straight away! On the negative side - the hotel bar was extremely pricey however no one is forcing you to drink there and there are plenty of watering holes nearby which are (slightly) cheaper!There was some redecoration taking place in the hotel duering our stay however it did not cause any disruption whatsoever.All the staff were very friendly and helpful and a credit to the hotel.Would definately recommend the hotel again and would also choose it for any further trips to London.
124,799,"Apr 17 2006	Wonderful staff!	We booked a Hilton King Deluxe for two nights and asked for a quiet room. The room was super and no traffic noise at all. Must be an achievement considering the Hotel is situated so close to Piccadilly! Hotel full but didn't feel particularly busy. No problems checking in or out.(A couple of very small points - bulb in table lamp and bathroom extractor fan not working. Didn't detract from the stay as fans annoy me anyway.)The staff were very helpful and the service in the restuarant was excellent. The food was good -breakfast and dinner. Our first evening meal was included but I found it a little odd that the menu didn't have any prices, so we decided to try else where on our second night. A lovely Italian restuarant off a side street - Down Street - in the direction away from Piccadilly Circus. Called Prezzo and very reasonable prices.Green Park Hilton only a couple of hundred yards from tube station and in an excellent position to visit everything. We walked to the London Eye, Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Sq, Oxford St and Covent Garden. Many theatres just up the road and no problems walking back late at night.I recommend the Hotel but didn't see the standard size rooms so can't comment on those. I will book the same room and stay there again."
125,799,"Mar 2 2006	Pluses and Minuses	Room was small and the decor/carpet a touch tired, but excellent shower - the most powerful I have experienced. And fantastic London location - with the beautiful Green Park two minutes away, and a multitude of tousist attractions on your doorstep. Comfortable bed too."
126,799,"Feb 14 2006 	Great location yet still off the beaten path	I stayed in this hotel for three weeks in early January before securing permananet accomodations in London. The room, even a deluxe, was small but adequate - very clean.The positives are the location and the breakfast buffet which actually may live up to the &quot;best breakfast in London&quot; claim. Traditional US and UK favorites.The wait staff in the restaurant is hyper-attentive, clearing plates within seconds. The bell staff - not so much - granted everyone seems to check in/check out at the same time here.The hotel is actually a bunch of townhomes pieced together on quiet street in Mayfair. So - depending on where your room is - you are likely to hear some floorboard squeaking from people above or around you - thats just the age of the structure."
127,799,Feb 13 2006 	Never Again!!	Booked deluxe room had to change rooms three times on first night due to numerous problems. Rooms small and tatty. However staff very friendly.
128,799,"Feb 2 2006	Great Hotel Perfect Location	Recently stayed at the Holton Green Park and was very impressed. When we arrived our room, although very nice was situated next to the lift and a certain amount of noise could be heard. After contacting reception they arranged 3 other rooms for us to look at and upgradred us to a superior suite. The new room we had was perfect, very large and spacious and with the best bedding I have had in a hotel for a long time. The breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice and the tiger brasserie was much better than expected. I have stayed at other Hilton's on the dinner free on first night deal but this is the only hotel where the food was menu based and not a carvery. I have to say the food was excellent. The location of the hotel is great. We did not have to use the public transport at all. Excellent hotel, would reccommend"
129,799,"Jan 16 2006	Very nice comfortable hotel	When arriving at the hotel the receptionist appeared at first not to be all that friendly. However when he realised I was staying there she could no have been more helpful.I was given a double room on the fifth floor at the rear of the hotel. However as it is on a side street I don't think any of the rooms would be subject to much external noise. The location of the hotel is ideal, being opposite green park and around the corner from the tube station and the Ritz if you fancy afternoon tea!The room itself was veery comfortable and, yes, by american hotel standards the room is small but unless you are going to spend most of the day in the room then you won't be disappointed with the size as there is enough room for a case and two people.The only negative comments I would say about the room which didn't really bother me but were not thought about when the rooms were refurbished was that the tea and coffee tray had to be moved to boil the kettle as the socket was nowhere near this. Also the bath was extremely slippery when taking a shower and there was no bath mat to put down.Breakfast was excellent with a great variety of food. The only thing that spoilt it a bit was the attitude of a female member of waiting staff who appeared quite unfriendly bordering on rude. But the other staff in the hotel were very accommodating and friendly with a bit of a personal touch.All in all an lovely comfortable and convenient hotel. I would definately stay there again!"
130,799,"Dec 31 2005	Very satisfied	We stayed here for a 3-day break between Christmas and New Year and were very pleased. We were on a bargain break deal and expected we might get an inferior room, but although it was pretty small, it was quite adequate and well appointed, with a good bathroom. We liked the decor in the public areas and the whole place had a very cosy, English feel to it. The buffet breakfast was really excellent, as was dinner in the restaurant. Drink prices are too high but only to be expected in central London. Also, the Concierge service was first rate, with really friendly, knowledgeable advice. Finally, what a location! Would definately go back."
131,799,Dec 23 2005 	Cosy well-located town house hotel	Hotel enjoys great location close to Piccadilly (the west end thereof) and (with a little zig-zagging) isn't far from Bond and Regent Streets either. Has a cosy feel to it and the staff are friendly. Breakfast is pretty good buffet fare though it isn't up to Hilton Park Lane standard as it doesn't have an optional a la carte menu (but your room is more expensive in the bigger HPL). Standard rooms in the hotel are on the small side and I was surprised to find no minibar - just tea/coffee making facilities. Just a bit of a pain to have to order a diet coke from room service! No in-house gym so had to go to HPL for that but again a function of its smaller size. I was in the front and can't say I noticed the noise. PS Why do some folks think they merit a room at a higher level than the one they paid for and then complain about it afterwards (see negative comment a few back)? I had no problem with any aspects of the housekeeping service. All in all I enjoyed the stay and would recommend.
132,799,"Nov 18 2005 	My glass is always half full is yours half empty....	Good room at the back of the hotel.Bar prices are bar prices in hotels, you have to accept that...if not drink somewhere else!Breakfast was the standard Hilton breakfast and as such was a good standard. Front of house staff were very polite and helpful as you would expect. Would stay again as good location. Just ask for a room at the back as I think that will impact on the noise levels."
133,799,"Nov 16 2005	Excellent Experieince	Having read several reviews before leaving for our trip and now all of them on return I find that a number of people had to be staying at a different Hilton Green Park. This was about our 8th trip to London in the past ten years and we have always stayed at different hotels in different locations. We would stay at the Green Park again in a moment! The location cannot be beat for what is offered in the immediate vicinity, and for the tube stop that is minutes away and has access to multiple lines, and especially for the street access to Picadilly Street and the theatre district a relatively short walk.The hotel was like many others in the London area, a series of buildings now linked together. We found the facilities, lobby, restaurant, and common areas very clean and almost new.I have to admit we used points to pay for the room and we did receive an upgrade to a large room in the front of the hotel. I will say that the noise from the street took a little getting used to, but the bed was so comfortable we had no trouble sleeping. The room was very nice, not overly done and the bathroom was very large. We found the staff to be extremely friendly, they were constantly checking to be sure we were happy. The front desk was friendly, we had to wait for a room as we arrived at 9:00AM (we knew this would happen) but they had one for us in the early afernoon. All in all we would not hesitate, and in fact will return to this hotel."
134,799,"Nov 6 2005 	Really Dissapointed the Second Time Around.	This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel and the second time I have written a review. My first review listed here raves about the hotel, however 11 months later I can now only complain. I arrived from Australia as we do early in the morning, however, had paid for the night before to ensure check in at 8am. I told the girl at reception (who refused to make eye contact with me)what a wonderful stay I had had 11 months ago and if I could possibly have the same room or at least the same type. The answer was no!! You did not book that type of room was the answer. She was not at all helpful, yet I was booked in for 7 nights. I went to the tiny room and found no towels,the computer connection broken and then the fire alarms kept going off. I unpacked and went straight to a meeting. When I returned i asked again saying that as the computer connection was not working, that I could not stay in the room. She agreed to move me , to the same size room. I had to repack and move myself. The hallways are grubby and the whole place has really gone down-hill in 11 months. I have recommended this hotel to so many people, but NOT ANY MORE. The hotel staff are not interested in making your stay enjoyable at all. Having said all that, the location is fantastic."
135,799,"Nov 3 2005	Excellent Choice	Myself and my husband have stayed at this hotel for the past 3 years on our weekends to London. We would recommend it to anyone. The location is perfect.They usually do special weekend deals that are very good value. The staff are very polite and professional. The rooms, although small(ish), are verycomfortable. The breakfast (which is buffet style) is the best we have ever had in any hotel.One small negative point, is the excessive bar prices,but this seems to be the way with most hotels.Will definately stay there again."
136,799,"Aug 29 2005	GREAT Location...... GREAT Hotel	Stayed here August bank holiday.Cannot fault the place in anyway whatsoever. Rooms are excellent, good size, comfortable beds &amp; a nice size bathroom. The dinner was absolutely SUPERB and for breakfast so many choices. The location is brilliant, just off Piccadilly opposite Green Park in a nice quiet street. Green Park tube station is a 3min walk.Cannot understand the not so positive reviews left."
137,799,"Aug 16 2005	Cosy hotel in great location !	We stayed at Hilton London Green Park for two nights in August 2005. We had booked two deluxe rooms through Hilton internet page and got a great offer ( 129.50 per room per night, VAT and breakfast buffet included). The room was large and very nicely decorated (white beds, light brown carpets and chairs) and the bathroom was huge. Dinner on the first night was included and was very good, breakfast buffet was excellent, with plenty of choice to choose from. And location was great, only 50 meters from Piccadilly and 7 minutes from Piccadilly Circus, in a side street with little traffic. We were very pleased with this hotel, which was the best from the three hotels we stayed at in London (the two others were Sheraton Park Lane and Holiday Inn Mayfair). The only down point was the fact that the restaurant did not have enough room for all guests, so that we had to wait for ten minutes to have dinner on the first night and to have breakfast the second morning."
138,799,"Aug 7 2005	Not great.	I really cannot believe all the four and five star postings. But before I rant I must divulge that we stayed there using Hilton points...so it didn't cost us anything. The only reason I could think of for the high ratings is price.This was a nice hotel forty years ago. It is essentially four or five buildings stuck together to form a hotel. Yes, the location is good. But the shabby lobby, dark and narrow halls, tiny rooms, no air conditioning, etc., do not make up for location. There is a very good Italian restaurant around the corner; Pappagallo. Expensive, like everything in London. Just grit your teeth and pay."
139,799,"Mar 14 2005 	Would not stay again	I stayed one night on business and was not favorably impressed. The room was small with a twin bed and was very cold (stayed 3/9/05). When I called the front desk to ask for several blankets, the person who delivered them asked if I had another person in the room with me! The bathroom was very clean and looked newly renovated. I found the staff to be indifferent, at best, and even on check-out was not asked how my stay was. I would not stay again."
140,799,"Feb 27 2005	Great location	Recently stayed for one night, staff very accomodating and pleasant. I had a room on the ground floor facing the road and although it had secondry glazing it was very noisy but what do you expect it is central london and if you want the location!!!!!!!!! Room comfortable and plenty of tea and coffee. Will definatly stay again."
141,799,"Dec 1 2004	Getting Better.	As in all real estate, Location! Location! Location! Walking distance to the Green Park Tube station. Convenient to the theater, museums, etc.This was our third visit to this hotel and our fourth trip to London. The urgently needed renovations were just completed in a minimialist decor. The rooms are still the same size. Clean and neat!Front desk staff expects you to believe them when they say there are no other rooms available to upgrade to. The first room, # 505, on the top floor, facing the rear and quiet was fitting for a Gosford Park servant with a twin and a half bed being used as a double and an ottoman as a chair.We were able to change to another standard room, # 114, , facing the front, noisy, across from the elevator, which had a queen sized bed and one real chair.The bathroom is large and bright. The amenities are minimal.The concierge staff is wonderful and can do anything on earth, except get you a better room.The bar is overwhelmed with cigar smoke and no air circulation. The bar staff prides itself on their motto, &quot;There is no way to get coffee, food or snacks after 11:00 PM, only liquor or beer.&quot;Ignoring all that, just stay at the hotel and send Erol a fabulous concierge my regards. Sincerely, Howard Newman"
142,799,"Nov 1 2004	GREAT VALUE DELUX HOTEL IN CENTRAL LONDON	i have staid at many hotel in london, including Hilton's.A few minor problems really. had booked a delux room but was allocated a standard due to lack of availability. Standard rooms are very small, have no a/c and very small beds. Having aired my concerns, i was upgraded to a junior suite (which i had to pay 40 extra for) but it was 40 well spent. a major improvment from a standard room. had to wait bout an hour for house keeping to clean the room. But a very spacious and tastefully decorated suite. very large lounge sitting area and huge bathroom. But again no a/c just a portable unit that did not work because it was full to the brim with water. asked reception to come and empty it, but never came. Apart from the minor service issues, a very pleasant boutique style hotel with good location to west end."
143,799,"Sep 21 2004	Nice place	We stayed at the hotel from 9/9 thru 9/14/04. I felt the hotel was a nice place...let's face it, many hotels in Europe are not up to our American standards. I knew the hotel did not have air conditioning (at least in the room I booked), so luckily it was not hot. We were given a room in the back on the 2nd floor with 2 windows. Though a bit small, we were very happy with it. The hotel was gracious enough to allow us to rest in an available room on the first floor facing the street when we got there, as we took a red eye over from the US. I would suggest you request a room in the back if at all possible, as the street was loud. The staff was accomodating, and the hotel is in a great location, just a 2 minute walk to the Green Park station, where you can pick up 3 lines on the tube. You can take the Picadilly line directly from Heathrow to Green Park, it takes about 45 minutes in rush hour...but I'm sure driving would take longer. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel."
144,799,"Sep 7 2004	New and zen	Been there from July 4th to July 6th 2004.I was given a newly refurbished room in a pure zen style, much more beautiful than those in classic english style advised in the photo gallery on the site of the hotel.The conditioning was very efficient, although provided by a portable air conditioner placed near the window. No minibar, but what's the matter?Very good breakfast, although air conditioned too high.Good restaurant and good service. Non existent concierge.Prefer this hotel than the other Hilton in the nearby (the Hilton London Mews).Overall, a good hotel wonderfully positioned in the heart of Mayfair, one minute away from Piccadilly right in front of Green Park.Unforrtunately, is not very close to any Wagamama restaurant: what means that I need to walk for twenty minutes before sitting for dinner!"
145,799,"Aug 17 2004	Lovely hotel in an excellent location	I stayed in this hotel in August 2004 and would highly recommend it. It is a nice small hotel with a homely feel and decorated in a contempary style throughout. The staff are great and could not do enough for us, even serving us a complimentary cocktail in the bar one evening. Breakfast was delicious although we did have to wait quite a while for a table one morning. The rooms are quite small but clean and modern. My only issues were the fact that there was no airconditioning in the room (although a fan was provided), or was there a minibar/fridge or safe which I find quite poor for a 4 star property. It is the location of this hotel which cannot be faulted. Situated on a quiet side street in the heart of Mayfair you can walk to all major West End attractions. We didn't have to use the tube once during our two day stay. There are also some lovely pavement bars and restaurants in a courtyard just at the back of the hotel. All in all, a great stay."
146,799,"Jun 29 2004	Spoilt by lack of air con	The hotel is in an excellent location and is well presented, with an impressive and welcoming foyer. Bedrooms are beautifully decorated, with contemporary furnishings and quality bathrooms. The staff is pleasant and anxious to please. Standards of housekeeping are high.The one big problem is the lack of air conditioning in the bedrooms (although it is installed in the attractive restaurant). This makes it difficult to sleep in the summer months. I was told by the reception staff that it is being progressively introduced and that all suites and deluxe bedrooms will have it by September 2004. I suggest that anyone thinking of staying here checks beforehand.If it were not for the lack or air conditioning, I would award this hotel four stars. Until then, it deserves only three."
147,799,"Jun 29 2004	Good value great location	We had a nice stay in the Hilton Green Park - an old hotel that has been given a nice contemporary feel. We were upgraded to a deluxe room which was very nice - slightly odd layout to the room, but again a clean and fresh feel, big bed and good bathroom.The hotel has also taken note of the a/c complaints, since we had a mobile a/c unit in our room, and a fan. The breakfast buffet which we had included in our rate was great, but the Friday night dinner buffet (also included) not really that worthwhile.The location is great - central for everything, but on a quiet street so there is little noise. If you are looking for a central, clean hotel with a good breakfast at a decent rate you could do a lot worse than the Green Park."
148,799,"Jun 28 2004	A little too old	This hotel is very close to central London (15-20 minutes walk to Piccadilly) and Green Park Tube Station (2 minutes). Nothing special to report. The room was small but clean, the bathroom looked dirty, but it was just old. 100% British style.It is not worth the money you pay."
149,799,"Jun 3 2004	A great experience....	We loved our stay here. A few minor irritants, but the hotel handled them very well. When we arrived last Saturday, they hadn't upgraded us, but when I requested an upgrade, they obliged to a nice room, but we overlooked the back alleys and there was some noise. I had asked to be moved when possible and the second night they did indeed move us. We were now in a fine suite, room 529, still overlooking the back alleys. But because we were now 5 levels above the ground, there was no noise. The rooms are stylish, clean, spare design. Comfortable king-size beds, great bathrooms, great water pressure. Breakfast was good. Breakfast was nice and the bar is probably the most comfortable place we found in our entire UK trip to sit and have a drink. It is spacious with comfortable easy chairs and couches. We sat by a window that we opened for fresh air and it felt wonderful to rest our weary bones with no smoke in a comfortable chair. Now the price of that drink is a bit ridiculous. 8 pounds for a glass of white house wine, translates to almost $15 for a glass of house wine! I was inclined to put up a fuss about that bill, but the following day they won me over with a very nice gesture. Due to high wine price at the bar, we'd bought a nice inexpensive bottle at a small shop, had drunk half the bottle before we left for the day. Upon returning, the bottle was gone. I called and asked where my bottle of wine had disappeared and they delivered a full bottle of much higher priced wine to the room within minutes. Not a terribly expensive gesture, but the kind of gesture which makes you appreciate a place.BTW, the location here is perfect. Quiet side street, within a block of Green Park, 1 block to Shepherd Street area behind the hotel which had at least 10 restaurant/pub choices for a nice evening, most of which served outside, 1 block to shop where cheap wine and snacks were available. We were able to easily walk to every sight we wanted to see with the sole exception of the London Tower and the Globe which we accessed by boat."

Over the road from Hyde Park very near to Kensington Palace. Never had problem checking in early after transatlantic flights staff always helpful.Breakfast faultless."
2,800,"Nov 23 2009 	Very hospitable!	The location is terrific, the accommodations very comfortable and the staff top-notch. Enjoy your stay!"
3,800,"Nov 17 2009 	Loved it!	We stayed here for 1 night and I was a little dubious after reading some of the reviews on here but I didn't need to worry. I booked this hotel for it's location (20 mins walk through Hyde Park to the Albert Hall or around 30 minutes to Harrods).When I booked online, I had the option to add a request (although requests are not guaranteed). I asked for a room overlooking Hyde Park if possible.When we got to the hotel we were told our room wasn't ready (despite being there 45 minutes after the time the rooms are supposed to be ready).The lady at the desk offered us a complimentary drink in the hotel bar while our room was prepared. We took her up on her offer and sat and chilled out in the bar for around 15 minutes before someone came in to say our room was ready.We were on the 2nd floor which we were told has been recently refurbished and indeed when we got to our room it overlooked Hyde Park.I'd just booked a basic room but it was really nice. Contemporary in design, and spacious enough for 2. Also it was not noisy as some have said on here. We live in the country and were expecting to hear loud traffic all night but we were pleasantly surprised.We had a lovely stay. The room was clean, the staff were very helpful, the breakfast was really tasty and we will definitely go back!"
4,800,"Nov 17 2009 	Very pleased	Recently stayed at this Hilton hotel for a week. Great location with beautiful views over Kensington Gardens. Excellent service from the attentive and polite staff (concierge, housekeeping, reception and restaurant). Room was clean, comfortable and quite spacious. I have truly enjoyed my stay at this London hotel and would not hesitate to return."
5,800,"Nov 9 2009 	Good location and reasonable price.	I booked the London Hilton Hyde Park mainly for it's location, knowing the standards of accomodation would be somewhat acceptable (rare to find in London!) and at a reasonable price.Well, the room was cozy, even though I got two twin beds even though I had asked and booked for a king bed. Nonetheless, breakfast was probably good though overpriced. So went for a coffee outside the hotel instead. When travelling by tube one can get pretty easy access from the hotel, as the location is quite good! That was really the most enjoyable part.Generally, I may stay at this hotel again, but I would definately look for other places as well. Nothing worse than staying at a London hotel."
6,800,"Oct 25 2009 	Decent hotel good location	Stayed for one night on a B&amp;B basis. Check in and departure was straightforward. Room was of a decent size, clean and adequately equipped and furnished. Breakfast was standard with the usual array eatables.The location was very good next door to the Queensway metro station. I had a room fronting Hyde Park. The view was nice however it was prone to some traffic noise. If i was returning to London I would consider staying at this hotel."
7,800,"Oct 16 2009 	Not a Hilton !!	Very dissapointing stay at this wanabee Hilton whilst on business for three days.Restaurant is pokey - no natural lighting and echoey - which is a problem when the chef is having an ongoing row with the solitary waiter throughout the meal!! Only 3 other diners but 25 mins to place order. Food bland and unimaginative. just three big lumps of Motzarella, three tired rings of tomato and the obligatory &quot;rocket&quot;, Not even a dressing on the salad and non available when requested !The steak was ok - but served with oven chips. AND NO MUSTARD AVAILABLE can you believe that - whats wrong with the Spa shop 50 yards away .Complained to surley supervisor.Woken at 10.30 ish by front of house who wanted to discuss complaintWoken at 5 ish by plumbing noises emmanating from bathroomNo Hot water available in morning - receptionist later claimed boiler problem had been sorted BUT WHY WASANT IT CHECKED IN THE FIRST PLACE!Told at check out that i would receive a discount and they would contact me Still waitingOh i nearly forgot - water is 3.50 a bottle and cheapest internet access 15 - rip off."
8,800,"Oct 13 2009 	took in a show	We have stayed here before so were happy to stay again.This is a really nice hotel which is very central to other attractions.We love the location as it brings back many happy memories for both of us. The hotel is very clean and the staff friendly and helpful. The breakfast will set you up for the day, believe me. The area is so diverse that its like trying to tune your radio into radio luxenburgh. ( those of us of this vintage will remember the various languages encountered ) We will return."
9,800,"Oct 8 2009 	Your classic average hotel	I don't know how anyone could rate this as either excellent or terrible. This is your classic &quot;average&quot; hotel. It's key positive is its location. Across the street from an entrance to Hyde park and near two subway stations. The hotel is clean and the rooms are of reasonable size. Some of the downsides include that it appears &quot;long in the tooth&quot;, the rooms can be noisy (especially if you overlook the park and the busy Bayswater Ave), there are very few spare electrical outlets in the rooms for one's electronics, the service is only average (not highly knowledgeable), the restaurant/lobby area are rather drab and uninviting, and the Queensway Ave. area around the corner is very tacky with lots of tourist shops and fast food joints..It is perfectly fine given its location and convenience. However, I wouldn't consider it for a personal vacation stay. Instead I'd opt to go to Notting Hill, just a mile away, to some of the more charming hotels with more proximity to better restaurants and shopping."
10,800,"Sep 26 2009 	Basic hotel	We stayed for 1 night this week, the room was fine, with a large TV, and tea/coffee facilities. We booked dinner, and was disappointed with it. I ordered Salmon and haddock fish cake with chilli dip, and a Rib Eye steak, and then to fish a chocolate fondant sweet. First of all the fish cake came (1) with No fish in at all, then the steak came and it definitely WAS NOT rib eye, more like a hamburger, I had to cut so much fat off. The chocolate fondant came and it was infact a chocolate pudding (like you get in Marks and Spencer, and much better than this) with a drizzle of milk chocolate around the plate. I did not complain because I had pre booked and pre paid for it, which I will not do again. I hate complaining, as sometimes it gets you nowhere, so I find it is better to just warn other people. We have stayed at Hilton hotels a lot and usually find the famous Hilton breakfast is all you need to set you up for the day, but not here!!! For a start the toaster was a 2 slice one!!! not the usual one where it goes in and other people can put more after yours. So you had to wait until the person in front of you had to do there's. Then it actually came out burned. The eggs looked as if they had been lying for ages, I myself like a runny yoke, but these were like rubber. We paid 165.00 for 1 night for this, and feel ripped off.We will NOT be staying here again."
11,800,"Aug 23 2009 	Great Location for this Hotel	Recently stayed three nights here while in London. It was in a great location: close to three tube stops, many restaurants, pubs and shopping in the Queensway area. Our room looked directly at Hyde Park: a beautiful view each morning. The buffet breakfast they served here was one of the best we've encountered on our UK travels. The staff was very attentive and so eager to please. We were given early check-in and maid service was prompt and efficient each day. The elevator is a bit small, so there is sometimes a bit of a wait to use it. We found the stairs to be faster especially in the morning hours. Rooms are quite spacious for European standards. They include desks with internet options, workspace and chair and additional sitting chair for relaxing. Hotel was very clean, complimentary newspapers each morning and friendly staff. The lobby is a bit small, but they have made efficient use of what space they do have with chairs and comfortable sitting areas. We enjoyed this area of London very much and will definetly use this hotel again."
12,800,"Aug 22 2009 	Not bad but disappointing for a Hilton property	I decided to try out two different Hilton properties on successive weekends in London this year. When compared to the Hilton Tower Bridge Hotel, the Hilton Hyde Park pales in comparison. The breakfast was merely adequate, there were no ice machines which meant calling room service a few times each day, and internet access was on the expensive side. Most listings I see show the Hilton Hyde Park as a 4-star property. I would give it three at best. There was nothing really wrong with the hotel, but nothing to recommend it either. For around the same money, I would advise staying at the Hilton Tower Bridge or the City Inn Westminster."
13,800,"Aug 21 2009 	Excellent Hotel...	Great hotel, great stay.... we were there for three nights in mid-Aug 2009.ROOMS:Well renovated and modern. Average size (based on London standards). Very clean and well kept. Internet available at 15 GBP per day. Nice view of Kensington Gardens. Overall very comfortable and clean.LOCATION:Brilliant... right across from Kensington Gardens (10 min walk to High Street Kensington, (through the park), 10 min walk to Notting Hill Gate, 10 min bus ride to Oxford/Bond Street). Right beside the Queensway tube station and 5 min walk to Bayswater tube station. Wonderful location to be in.BREAKFAST:Very large selection.... similar to a buffet breakfast at a hotel in America. The most pleasant surprise was the service at breakfast. The staff were exceptionally polite and diligent. It was truly comparable to service at a 5-star restaurant. Very happy with both the food and service.OVERALL:Would highly recommend and would stay here again."
14,800,"Aug 15 2009 	Disappointment*Worst Hilton Hotel ever*	The worst Hilton Hotel ever! stayed at this hotel for the first time and also my last. 3 nites at this hotel at the 6th floor room with a twin size bed. My first night turn out to be the worst night of my trip, air condition broke down in my room, called for help and waited for 30mins of no follow up from the staff until i called the 2nd time, 20mins later a staff showed up with a small fan, telling me they can't fixed the air condition and have no room to exchange. A fan in the middle of the summer night of my business trip.......They did fixed the air condition the 2nd day of my stay but it can only be 19c, no way to adjust thus my second night is freezing cold and the elevator broke down. Need to use the service elevator instead. But it can only take you to 5th floor, I was staying at 6th floor so I need to take the stairway. What an experience ! Sent a message to Hilton customer service after my trip, it took them more than 2 weeks and couple of follow ups before the hotel respond to my message. the result was the Hotel willing to comp me a free night for my next stay! A free night for my business trip dont do me any good, most importantly I dont think I can handle the torture anymore. One more reminder, if your room rate not include Breakfast then I suggest you go somewhere else instead of taking the breakfast at the hotel for GBP18. Good Luck!"
15,800,Aug 14 2009 	Good hotel for a weekend break.	We had a twin room on the 6th floor overlooking Hyde Park so pretty happy with that especially since I was using Hilton points to pay for the room. The room was clean as was the ensuite and beds were comfortable. Noise from the road or elsewhere in the hotel was not a problem. Location is good especially with Hyde Park across the road and Queensway and Bayswater tube stations are virtually under the hotel. We didn't have breakfast or use the bar area but there are a couple of nice cafes right next to the entrance and plenty of other eateries on Queensway just round the corner. Staff were friendly and helpful.
16,800,"Aug 10 2009 	BAD	We were hoping to enjoy Hilton Hotel hospitality but instead of that we had the very worst treatment that is possible!Me and my wife had a very unpleasant surprise in London. We planned a romantic weekend in London and booked and prepaid(from 22/07/2009) the hotel Hilton Hyde Park London. Some of the reasons that we booked that hotel were that it is located in an old beautiful building near a great park(Hyde Park). Unfortunately for some reason we were moved to a different hotel, that is not in the center, is a modern 3 star hotel and in a very small room. I have to mention once more... we had pre paid the room 20 days before! but for some reason there were no available!!! and despite that (which is thier mistake) we were downgraded to a diferent hotel !!! I will really consider in the future on staying in a Hilton Hotel !! Till now I have writen 3 letters to them and have received no answer! that is all ! thank you"
17,800,Aug 10 2009 	Not great but not as bad as some reviews might suggest	Booked this for overnight in London on business. Unusually did not check first with TA and was expecting worst having read reviews after booking. However reception area was small (can see some might call pokey) and lift was broken; not bode well. Avoid restaurant for dinner - bread rolls not fresh - but breakfast is good. Smallish room but not unusual for London and certainly comfortable. Not the best Hilton in London but better than the one at Olympia.
18,800,"Jul 6 2009 	Well located with excellent staff	To start with the best aspect of the hotel: its staff. I have rarely, if ever, stayed in a hotel where the staff were so friendly and helpful. Not just one or two, but every one we came across. As for the hotel itself, it is much as you would expect a Hilton in central London. It is in an old building and the rooms vary a lot in size. We saw three which varied from a a decent size you would expect in a newly build Hilton right down to small.The rooms are are all recently decorated and refurbished. The bathrooms likewise. Breakfast was reasonable and typical of this type of hotel, but unless we had got it included in our rate we would not have paid the 17 standard rate for it.The location is good, in that you are only 20 metres from Queensway tube station on the Central Line, which will take you directly into the heart of the West End in just 5 minutes or so."
19,800,"Jun 10 2009 	Charming Small Hotel with Very Friendly Service.	Just spent a weekend at this hotel. Got a very good rate at Priceline. Did not expect much. Pleasantly surprised at very friendly check-in. Small but very comfortable rooms with clean bathrooms and nice size tub. Although hotel is on a busy street, inside room was absolutely quiet.Hotel is literally on Queensway tube station and on several good bus routes that will get you to just about anywhere in Central London. The surrounding area is very vibrant and sports restaurants and cafes for every taste. Finally, hotel faces Hyde Park with opportunities for lovely strolls and a 15 minute walk to Kensington High Street.All in all a great little find!!"
20,800,"May 14 2009 	Where Hilton sends reject guests	My story - after a 14 hour plus working day, looking forward to getting something to eat and relaxing in comfortable room before pre-dawn start to Brussels - I arrive at my original hotel (Hilton Tower Bridge) and it's closed!!! Ok - burst water main, things happen, but despite having a pre-paid room, no one informed me (by email, mobile or text). Of course I call Hilton reservations to explain situation and arrange simple transfer... WRONG! From arrival at original hotel at just before 8pm, I am on phone with Hilton reservations for at least an hour - on hold for the most part and hung up on once! No one seems willing or ready to help; certainly no one is interested in making special effort to accommodate a customer stuck in London at 9pm with no room/bed, dinner or place to go... Eventually I am told to go to a Hilton hotel at Trafalgar Square - by taxi which I pay for myself... There a genuinely helpful person called Lisa Schwedt (thank you) eventually tells me while they had taken transfer from the Tower Bridge Hilton they are now full and I need to take another taxi - which I paid for - to the Hilton at Hyde Park... Let me tell you about the Hilton at Hyde Park - it is a DUMP... my room smells like a mini cab, no mini bar, filthy old bathroom, tiny - more like an Ibis than anything else. So in short having prepaid for a room at a hotel that I like and trust (returning customer) because I wanted a comfortable nights sleep, two hours later I am stuck in a hotel that is no better than a roadside motel. Thank you Hilton - I will not be staying with your group again and I will be advising my company, colleagues and friends likewise."
21,800,"May 13 2009 	Tiny room nice breakfast reasonable location	Reasonable for business travel - breakfast pricey like all Hiltons in London, but nicer breakfast room than many. Room pretty small (no bath) but otherwise OK - not sure if this is typical of this hotel. Small hotel meant slightly better service and general ambience. Reasonable location if you need to get to somewhere on the Central line."
22,800,"May 7 2009 	Excellent - no complaints - though only a short visit	Stayed here for one night only and I have to say in that very short visit I was impressed. Staff were very helpful and courteous, food was good, rooms were (for London) reasonably well sized and the public areas - lounge and restaurant - were comfortable. Having said that I've now stayed at Hilton Hotels so often that I have managed to worm my way through to 'Gold Card' level so I get upgrades, free breakfasts etc. so I'm not sure my experience refeletcs that of the non-Hiltonhonors member or if the rooms I am alocated are typical of the rest of the hotel. But from what I saw I would have no complaints - though I'm not sure it would be a great place to stay for any more than a two or three nights.One thing I have to say is that the position and accessiblity of this place is fantastic, Looking right out over Hyde Park and literally next door to the nearest tube (Queens Park) it is a dead easy to get to and has some of the best views in the capital (from the rooms at the front on the upper floor anwyay)."
23,800,Apr 28 2009 	small property	Rooms are small. not suitable for busines trips.
24,800,"Apr 21 2009 	Surprisingly good	My experience of London hotels hasn't been great so was expecting to be underwhelmed by The Hilton Hyde Park.It's situated right opposite what I think is one of the main entrances to the park and it's less than 15 minutes from the hotel to Kensington where I was working through the park - very pleasant. The reception area is small but checking in was fine with no delay, receptionist staff friendly. The lift was very small but as I was on the second floor it was no problem using the staircase.My double room was small but not claustrophobic. Good wardrobe space, desk, large LCD TV and an effective air conditioning unit. My view wasn't great looking over the inside courtyard of the hotel.Like the rest of the room, the bathroom was spotlessly clean. Again, quite compact but perfectly functional, lots of towels and toiletries and the the shower pressure was very good.Like just about every other hotel, room service food is a rip off - fortunately there are loads of restaurants nearby along with a Spar and Tesco Express.Continuing the rip-of theme, continental breakfast was 14. Totally unjustifiable. Internet access is 15 for 24 hours. If you can find alternatives to the extortionate food rates then this hotel is just fine,"
25,800,"Apr 17 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised	Booked a 4 night stay through Priceline. Once we got the confirmation we came to TA to look at reviews and were worried. I know everyone's experience will be different but we had none of the issues mentioned by the most negative reviews. Thought the hotel was nice and clean and the staff friendly. We had a double room which was roomy enough for a couple gone all day anyways. The bathrooms were clean, water hot, and had a nice towel warmer. No ice machines in the hotel but the staff was always pleasant to bring us a champagne bucket full of ice upon requet. Queensway Tube stop literally next door made travel easy. Also took the Fat Tire Bike Tour which meets right outside their front door. Had a great time and hope you do too!"
26,800,"Apr 17 2009 	good location decent hotel....	to tell you the truth i expected more from a hilton brand....while the location of the hotel was excellent, the hotel itself was just ok....the hilton hyde park is bang opposite the hyde park &amp; right next to the queensway tube station....there are a number of restaurants &amp; shops within walking distance from the hotel....oxford street is a 15-20 minute walk as well....like a stated before, the location is excellent....as my colleague &amp; i were in london around christmas for work, we managed to get a great deal of only 69 per night for 7 nights....my having diamond status with hilton helped as well as we were upgraded to a deluxe room....the hotel was quite small &amp; the rooms seemed a little dingy by hilton standards....there was also only 1 restaurant which was not open 24 hours &amp; had a limited menu choice....the hotel was clean though &amp; the staff was polite &amp; helpful....next time i am in london i would probably stay at the hilton metropole or the hilton paddington as they are both very centrally located &amp; having stayed at both those properties before i can easily say the hilton hyde park does not come close to either one of those two...."
27,800,"Apr 8 2009 	Tries hard... falls short	My wife and I were put in two single rooms for the first of a three-night stay owing to overbooking. Changed to a twin room for the next two days. Twin room was hardly any bigger than the singles, even with two beds. Hot water off the second night when we wanted to shower. Otherwise, great service from wonderfull staff, brilliant location (out of town, but 12 paces from the Queensway tube, and plenty of passing cabs). Directly opposite Kensington Gardens (but quite a way from Hyde Park), and a 30minute stroll to the Albert Hall. Excellent multi-cultural food a few yards away. Would go again, becasue having travelled the world, have learned to overcome small setbacks. For around 100 a night, very good value. They do try very hard, and I admire that - but human error can't be entirely factored out."
28,800,"Mar 28 2009 	This is a very nice hotel in a great location.	The Hilton Hyde Park gave us great service whenever we needed it. From storing our luggage even before we checked in to serving us (and even cranky guests) very kindly at its very good breakfast, all the staff at this fine establishment quietly made us feel quite welcome and comfortable. Sitting across Bayswater Street from Hyde Park, this is an older hotel, which was nicely made over in the Hilton image, and this provides an excellent location for sight seeing and enjoying the diverse population of this part of London. It nearly overlooks the children's playground dedicated to Princess Diana. It is literally just around the corner from a tube stop on Queensway Street, which provides access to all of London including King's Cross Station (think Harry Potter) and St. Pancras (international Eurostar trains) that share the same tube stop. Queensway Street also has innumerable modestly priced ethnic restaurants, a real benefit unless you really enjoy English food! It's also within a brisk 30 minute-or-so walk of Notting Hill (of same-name movie fame) and all the unique shops and atmosphere it has to offer. We really couldn't have asked for more in a location. Our room was more than adequate for tourists on the go who only required a comfortable bed to crash in and a good bathroom to clean up in. It did have a very nice flat-screen t.v. for use when we were unwinding from pounding the cobblestones of the Tower of London, which wasn't close at all to our hotel, but quite reachable by tube. Our room had a bay window overlooking the park and Bayswater Street, which was a bit noisy with the window open (it was unseasonably warm during our stay), but it wasn't enough to bother our jet-lagged sleep. We felt it just added to the whole experience, which was great. We intend to return to this hotel the next time we're fortunate enough to make a trip to this amazing country. London is one of the great cities of the world and the Hilton Hyde Park is a fine place to see it from."
29,800,"Mar 20 2009 	Good location reasonable hotel	Spent one night at the Hilton as I had a layover between flights. Good location, next to the Queensway tube stop. I walked from Paddington station and it took about 10 minutes though a mix of residential buildings and other hotels. Booked through Priceline and was very happy with the rate.The hotel itself is fairly typical London: A little tight at times, small check in area, reasonably sized bar/restaurant. The two staff members at the desk did a good job getting people in and helping answer questions for people on their way out. The room was small, but really not that bad. Two large closets with hangars would be nice for longer stays. As previous reviews note, it was very warm in the room when I got back at night. The cooling system was not working and opening a window didn't help much. It cooled a bit overnight and I slept pretty well. The double bed in my room was a good size although a little creaky as it was a mattress on top of a platform and springs.One minus with this hotel is lack of wireless internet. They do have wired internet for 15 per 24 hours, which seems steep."
30,800,"Feb 26 2009 	Pleasant surprise	Selected this hotel primarily for central location for business trip to London, and was wary as friends had been (admittedly a couple of years ago) and were not impressed. Very small reception area but warm welcome and very efficient check in. Was heading for dinner so did not get a chance to eat in the hotel, but had a quick drink in the bar and service was again good. Nice library bar area also quite compact but good selection of magazines and papers.Good night's sleep although one issue (which I heard other guests mention) was that the rooms and hotel in general were very warm. Breakfast was fine - again highlight really efficient and polite service.Check out also fine - all in order. Overall kind of a &quot;mini&quot; Hilton but no worse for that. Would stay again for a 1 night stop over."
31,800,"Jan 31 2009 	If you don't mind being in a youth hostel...	This hotel should not be considered a Hilton. There are certain standards, which I believe the Hilton name should hold - good service is at the top of the list. The moment I walked in, they couldn't find my name. I waited in the lounge for close to an hour as they kept taking other guests and after each one would say, &quot;we'll get your room shortly&quot;. Finally they found my name and took me to my room. If you've ever been in a hostel, you'll know what these rooms look like... small with no ability to change the temperatures. The breakfast the next morning took the cake. I was told the buffet is 17 pounds, but if I walk back out and go to the reception I can obtain a breakfast voucher and buy it for 10 pounds. So, I walked back to the reception, they couldn't find any breakfast vouchers and had to retrieve some from the back... then they said to walk back to the restaurant and give them the voucher so I could post it to my room. An incredible waste of services and my time for sure... the rest of the trip was pretty much in uniform with this type of service.... very very poor."
32,800,"Jan 12 2009 	Great experience and fantastic location	All I needed was a place to sleep that was quiet and in a good location. I was really surprised by the Hyde Park Hilton. The room was tiny by American standards, but I didn't care. I took the Heathrow Express from the airport to Paddington Station and then toook the tube only one stop to Bayswater. The hotel was just a short block away from the tube. I was able to check in before 3 (which was god because I was exhausted).As others have said, the neighborhood was really convenient. Restaurants, shops, Starbucks, a Catholic Church all within a minute's walk. Also, the Queensway tube station is right around the corner from the hotel (even closer then Bayswater!) so travelling around London was super convenient.Jorge was the one who checked me in and he addressed me by name every time he saw me. Andreja was another helpful staff member at the front desk. They made me feel welcome and special. This hotel has a great bar (the Library Bar) which looks like a comfortable old library in an English manor house. The bar staff was attentive and nice. It was great to come back to the hotel after a full day of sightseeing and just relax in the bar.The only minor drawback was a little bit of noise one night (the doors are not soundproofed), but otherwise, it exceeded all my expectation. I highly recommend this hotel."
33,800,"Nov 25 2008 	A Good Hotel	The hotel is situated at the NorthWest corner of Hide Park.Rather quiet place. If u book a room at the front side, u 'll have a Park view...just good.It is exactly besides Queensway station of Underground (Tube).So it takes 15 min. totaly (changing the necessary train lines) to the central places. e.g. BigBen , or Picadilly Sqr , or National Museum...The entrance-reception Area of the Hotel is small , however it is more comfortable at the Lobby &amp; Breakfast area.Breakfast buffet is really a BIG advantage of this Hotel.About the rooms, the most of them are rather small , without minibar. They offer u a bottle of water and the choise to make sth to drink using the evaporator of your room.The hotel is clean , as rooms , too.The staff &amp; the servise general is very kindly &amp; helpfull ! We'd stay again in the future."
34,800,"Nov 13 2008 	great vacation stay	well this place was all it said they were doing some remodeling but the room was very nice and clean and room service was great every evening when arrived back at room the bed was made and clean towels and they made sure when you got back to your room it was like you just checked into it great job. The room service was a bit high i suggest breakfast walk out the hotel go to your left and a block and a half good breakfast good price. Now as far as all other service at hotel hard to beat everyone there was ready to help with any question you had about the area or attractions they looked up times for us at differnet places to go do things and they told us what trains to catch witch was very helpfull due to this hotel is like a 2 mins walk to the underground tub station and right by bus station if you go to london make sure to check out and get the london pass and one pass travel card this will be very helpfull and worth the money in the long run but this hotel was close to very nice park, and alot of resturants, and shops. If you go to london you wont be disapointed at this hotel i read other reviews before i went some good aqnd some bad and to be honest i didnt see anything bad here and had a great stay and vacation there and i am planning on going back next year and will stay at this hotel again.  Thank You,  Hilton Hyde Park &amp; hotels.com"
35,800,"Nov 11 2008 	Dirty Small and basic things do not work (heating)	This Hotel has a brand that is supost to be the a leading brand in the world.Heating not working, the desk in the room could not be use even me i am 5 feet 10 not that high, due to room so small.The ruber rug to put in the shower for non sliping, has mildew all over the back and is so old this rug at least a couple years.I ask for a room change due to not heat working and they said that they could not, So I ask to speak to the manager in 5 minutes I was changed to another room. this other room againg filty and again no heating working, The hotel does not deserve to be in a Hilton Chain and worse charge 200  a night. I would never recomend this hotel"
36,800,"Oct 25 2008 	Nice Hotel	I liked this hotel. Was booked at the last minute so wouldn;t normally have choosen this Hilton but we were glad we did.When we arrived the hotel had scaffolfing up as they were having work done, but to be honest this didnt disrupt us.This hotel is within easy walking distance to the subway so getting about London is easy.Rooms were small, it was a single room but for one person it was enough space. It was very warm in London when we were there so the air con was fab.Staff were ok, noone really sticks out for giving great service to us though."
37,800,"Oct 12 2008 	Should not be a Hilton hotel	This hotel should not be a Hilton hotel. The rooms are very small (even for London standards) and very hot. When I arrived in my room all lights were out, the TV was on and the heating was put to the highest temperature. The windows cannot be opened. At 2AM in the night the fire alarm went off. It was totally unclear for me and some other guests what to do and what was happening. The next day I heard that it was a technical error. The staff is not very friendly and hard to understand because of their (East European?) accent. I really don't advice you to stay here, there are better places in London to stay for the same price (it is not a very cheap hotel)"
38,800,"Oct 10 2008 	Loved the Hilton Hyde Park and recommend it	We booked and paid for the hotel on the website months before our trip. Our stay included a special rate with breakfast and dinner included on the first night. We arrived around 8am on a Saturday morning from a 22 hour flight from Sydney, Australia and were greeted by a beautiful smiling friendly face. As it was so early we had expected that our room would not be ready and on checking in asked where we could freshen up, and to our surprise were told our room was ready for us. The staff both at reception and in the restaurant were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.The room was a double room and was very comfortable and clean and fully functional for our 2 night stay. The bathroom had a full size bath tub with shower and a large vanity unit.The double glazed windows keep out any noise and you wouldn't know you are on a main road. The view to Hyde Park is a bonus.We would definately stay there again, even for more than 2 nights. Highly recommend this hotel for comfort, affordability and convenient proximity to all forms of transport."
39,800,"Oct 8 2008 	Good Hotel Great Location	This is a good hotel. The rooms wont be the same size ANYWHERE in europe, as they are in North America, so dont even expect it. I had a double room, which was small, but I wasnt spending much time in the room anyways. For around 100 pounds, which is the MINIMUM you will spend in London, you arent going to find a better deal on a centrally located London hotel. Directly next to Queensway station on the Central line, or a 5 minute walk from Bayswater on District, its very easy to get around London quickly. Queensway St also has a ton of chinese, persian, lebanese, indian restaurants as well as your typical fast food, and convenience stores all open very late."
40,800,"Sep 29 2008 	Great Location but not a typical Hilton experience	We stayed here for 3 nights. The location is great !Bayswater and Queensway Tube stations literally around the corner. Notting Hill Tube station is one stop away. Main street around the corner has tons of restaurants, pubs, a Starbucks and souvenir shops. I felt safe walking around at night. Across the street is Kensington Park and the Princess Diana Memorial kids playground is right inside the park. The park is beautiful to walk around or just sit on a bench and write in your journal. The hotel itself was more of a &quot;boutique&quot; style hotel. The rooms were small and bathrooms small (typical of European hotels). The stay was nice and I would stay there again, it just wasn't as nice as some of the Hilton hotels in the US."
41,800,"Sep 24 2008 	Good Hotel for London	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights while visiting London. As far as London hotels go, and we've stayed at plenty, it was above average, but I feel it was not up to the standards of a &quot;Hilton&quot; hotel. The location is the best thing about this hotel, located right across from Hyde Park and close to two tube stations so it's super easy to get anywhere in London from here. There was a mix up with our check in, we had reserved a double room, but were told there were none available, so we were put into a room with two twin beds. It was extremely small and smelled simply awful, very moldy and stuffy. Even opening the window did no good. Fortunately, after reviewing our reservation the next morning, we were put into a larger double room that had room to move around in and didn't smell. We had no problems with this room, it was clean (I was very happy with the daily cleaning service too) and well ventilated. The staff of the hotel was friendly and helpful, but one of the receptionists did not speak good English and she was difficult to understand. I found that odd, thought that a Hilton hotel would for sure have an excellent English speaker at the front desk. Breakfast is good, includes everything you would possibly want for breakfast, but some of the foods were not very tasty, so it was not of a high quality. Overall, however, we were satisfied with the hotel and will probably stay there again when we visit London in the future."
42,800,"Sep 24 2008 	Pleasently surprised!	My mum booked this hotel recently for our three day trip to London Which was a slightly early birthday treat. I have to admit from reading the previous reviews before I went I was a bit aprehensive, but I really don't know why people are rating it so bad....and I can be quite fussy. The room was adequate enough (stayed on 5th floor)- nice decor, good lighting, bath/shower, ample storage space for belongings, comfy beds, iron/ironing board, safe, tv, hairdryer, complementary refreshments, toiletries, daily papers. They were cleaned to a high standard and there was ample enough space to move around our twin bedroom aswell. The staff were friendly and helpful and the meals which we had included as a special price deal were really good. It certainly worked out cheaper than eating out all the time.Breakfast consisted of a huge choice..full english cooked breakie, toast and pastries/cakes, fruit salad, cereals, tea, coffee, juice. Dinner you had a choice off a menu (starter/main course/desert all fullfilling/nicely displayed) and there was enough options for vegetarians and other dietary requirements. My only two gripes were that the room did get very stuffy and quite hot at nights and we was unable to change the air conditioning control..but having the window open slightly helps as does bringing along some vics vapor rub,lol. The noise out the front tends to quiten down considerably around 2am even at wkends. Also even though there was a shower curtain the bathroom floor still got slightly flooded so it's advisable to put a towel down (a few supplied already) . The hotel in itself is good value and is especially close by to a couple of tube stations, lovely parks, shops, restaurants all of which is very handy. Sure in a few places it could do with a lick of paint or the carpeting washed but nothing was that bad. After all one doesn't come to London to be holed up in their hotel all the time do they?"
43,800,Sep 19 2008 	Average Hotel at best	Pretty good location with 2 Tube stops really close. That was about the only good thing. It's a bit pricey for the quality even in London. Bathroom and toilet is way too small. Way below standards for a Hilton.
44,800,"Aug 28 2008	I really like this hotel but you have to work a bit...	I've stayed at this property twice. Neither was a perfect stay, but overall this is my favorite midpriced hotel in London. Best feature is location: Hotel is located adjacent to two Tube stops which give you quick access to a large portion of the city. Across the street from Hyde Park, and on Queensway, a busy street with many affordable ethnic restaurants. Try the Kebap House about a block and a half north of the hotel.The rooms are mostly recently painted and remodeled... I would recommend against booking the cheapest rooms. They are quite small. Others can be spacious, and still relatively affordable. I also like trying to get rooms on the back of the hotel. I found the rooms to be well insulated from exterior sounds... even when your window is above Bayswater, a busy road. I had an air conditioning issue... and have heard of others. The staff were appropriately apologetic and took action quickly to solve the problem. Made for a long night, but they made it up to me the next day with a room upgrade.Showers/plumbing are workable, nothing fancy, and fairly small.Breakfast buffet is &quot;eh&quot;... I prefer the place next door, which is also cheaper.Overall, the tremendous positive of the location, plus caring staff, make this one a keeper for my travels. I've had a tough time with London hotels in this price range..."
45,800,"Aug 27 2008 	Not up to Hilton standards but convienent.	Hitchcock used this hotel in the filming of Frenzy, and it this was a favorite place for the famous in the 60's and 70's---so says the brochure and tourbooks. Too bad the hotel hasn't been kept up to date.My first problem was my own. The hotel website says to use the Queensway tube station, turn right, go to the corner, turn right, hotel 3 minutes walk. Well, I made the rights and walked for three minutes. Then walked back. The hotel is just around the corner. The entrance is small, just beyond and ice cream shop. And if I had gotten of at the Bayswater stop on the Central line, came up to ground level and turned right, in about thirty feet I'd have been there. The check in person said yes that is a problem.The staff was friendly, and I liked the location, across from the northwest corner of Hyde Park, near Kensington Palace and Notting Hill. The room was quiet, but beyond that I should have saved my HHonors points and reserved a dorm room at a local university for a cheap price. The bath was dated and the tilework needed to be redone. I've been in much cheaper digs with better bathrooms. The room was tiny. I had about a foot and a half around the bed before hitting a wall or furniture. The air didn't work well, and the windows were hard to open, and let in the noise. I went into and checked out the Ramada up the street. It would have been a better choice.The saving grace was Queensway street. Full of a variety of ppeople, and ethnic restaurants. I especially liked the Thai place called something like Tam on the east side of the street.Next time I'll stay in he same area as it is great for transport and walking the park, but I'll try to get a dorm room at a local college instead. It will have more room, and the bath, while shared might be more modern, at a lower cost."
46,800,"Aug 3 2008	A horrible hotel.	This hotel is a joke. I was given a room in which in order to get to the window I had to jump over the bed. The desk was blocked by the bed. It was an absolutely horrible experience. The people at the front desk could not have cared less. I was offered a bottle of wine by three different people and the bottle never made it to my room. The safe deposit box in the room didn't work, and nobody could figure out how to fix it. DON'T STAY AT THIS DUMP!"
47,800,Jul 26 2008 	Nice hotel good location good service	This hotel was ideal for a sight seeing vacation in London. It sits on the Bayswater tube station (Red line) and the Yellow/Green line station is a short walk. The street of Bayswater is a bit of a tourist street but did not feel unsafe. The service at the hotel was very good - we had trouble one night with a bad A/C in the room but was moved to another room the following night for the rest of our stay without a problem. We had breakfast included and the meal was good each morning. The hotel is not really in the downtown shopping or theater area but is a short tube ride away to either location. The hotel was a fairly good price performance but still a little expensive - (most places are in Londan). I would stay here again - I would recommend the hotel as a median priced hotel.
48,800,"Jun 30 2008 	Great location Accomodating staff	Great location for getting around London on the tube. Queensway tube station on the Cental line just steps from the front door. Receptionist was very helpful in a complicated arrangement of four rooms some of which were paid for with breakfasts included and one dinner others were Hilton Honors rewards with breakfast for some of the days etc.. She took the time to get it right when we checked in.Good breakfast buffet statisfied hungry teenager as well as parents. Really good orange juice.Rooms are varied. room 223 too small with a set of steps inside the door and no place for more than one carryone on the floor. Room 410 very nice. Double paned windows on Bayswater cut the sound nicely. Rooms overlooking Queensway had some traffic noise.Hyde Park entrance directly across the street. A nice attraction for walking in open space in a crowded city. Would go back again, just be smarter about which rooms are given to you."
49,800,"Mar 4 2008 	Good Hotel - Great Location	We were very happy with our stay at this hotel. Our room was at the back of the hotel on the fifth floor , very comfortable and clean.Our room was very quiet . Unless you particularly want a view over the park I would recommend you ask for a room at the back as you get hardly any traffic noise !We found the staff to be very attentive and friendly. The breakfast service was not the best but we found the food and variety of choice to be of excellent quality.Our room rate included breakfast and at 120 per night for a double room in central London was an excellent deal.Location is fine with two underground stations within 5 minutes walk enabling swift travel throughout the capital. Kensington gardens immediately opposite for a nice quiet stroll. We walked into Oxford Street but that is a good 20 minutes brisk walk .Quite a lot of restaurants in the immediate vicinity and a Tesco Metro (open long hours).All in all a very good experience."
50,800,Feb 26 2008 	Great Position	My sister and I stayed here for four nights 16th to 20th Feb.I was a little worried by some of the previous reviews but was pleasantly surprised. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. The only gripe would be the water pressure in the shower.The position of the hotel can't be beaten close to two tube stations and buses right out side. Beautiful Kensington Gardens directly opposite.Would definitely stay here again.

52,800,"Jan 9 2008 	Never never accept Room 224!	What should you expect of a 4 star hotel in London when you are paying a very low price through a last minute (don't know hotel until booked) deal? Well, you certainly don't expect the executive suite but you don't expect a grim room either- there should be no grim rooms in a 4-star hotel. However, grim room is what we got.Beware Room 224 - never, never accept it! I asked for only one thing from my budget-price room - as quiet as possible. The deputy manager gave me such a spiel - no view (definitely right - rubbish on fire escape - view so bad they covered the windows with non-see through film!) but , he said, very quiet - indeed he slept in that part of the hotel when he needed to stay overnight.Is this man deaf? We were (I think) over the lift shaft of Queensway tube station. So, from 5.45 am until after midnight you could have assumed that the TWO lifts were in the room with you, so loud was the noise and so constant. I asked to change rooms but was punished by being offered a poky room which you could barely move around. I got the message - and as we were there for 4 days I took the noise and bought earplugs - which I needed all the time when we did not have the TV on to drown the noise.Plus points? Well, the room was relatively large, there was a flat screen TV and the chambermaid kept it as clean as she could. HOWEVER, it was scruffy (chair just about to get a hole in the upholstery, bath grimy around plug, grout coming away around the bath, cracked tiles on bathroom floor) and the flat screen TV showed only Channels 1-5 and Sky News.I paid only 69 per night for the room, which is cheap by London standards but cheap was definitely what I got. I got the impression that the cheaper the deal, the nastier the room you get, even if there are better rooms available as the hotel was far from full.And with breakfast costing 20 each (no, we didn't take it) and drinks in the bar at 5 each there is a definite feeling of rip-off even at that low price. No, I shall not be going there again."
53,800,"Jan 4 2008	Better than the reviews	Having read some of the reviews on TripAdvisor before going we were prepared for the worst: small rooms, dirty rooms, indifferent staff, mildew, lack of hot water etc. In fact we found none of these things and had a very pleasant night there in a smart, clean, warm, good size room which would have had good views over Kensington Gardens if it hadn't been too dark to see. We had booked it via lastminute.com so we didn't expect to get premium treatment, which only added to the pleasant surprise. We would definitely stay there again.John Jacobs"
54,800,"Dec 13 2007	Mediocre hotel with small rooms and mildewed shower	This was not value for money. Overall quality was poor: ignorant receptionist; room service trays lying about all day; grubby literature; decor exceptionally ordinary. All the signs of a slack establishment. The room we were offered was very small: it was impossible to walk round the bed easily; the bath was badly chipped. There was only one chair for two people. The second room we were offered was slightly bigger: it had two chairs but only a shower, no bath. The shower was filthy with mildew. Although promised in the voucher there was no minibar and no PlayStation. Not worth what we paid."
