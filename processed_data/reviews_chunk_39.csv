31,881,"May 19 2009 	Watch out for coach parties!	HiStayed here on Sunday 17th and Monday 18th May.I have used Jurys Inns quite frequently before (particularly in Newcastle) and I have generally been impressed.This was my first and last time in this particular hotel. Positives:Friendly staffReasonable location (less than 10 minutes from nice bars / restaurants)Decent sized roomsNegatives:Dowdy barThin walls between rooms, leading to everything being heard from adjacent rooms if you have noisy neighbours (no worse than Travel Inn type rooms though)Main concern: During my 2 night stay there were two coachloads of foreign visitors staying, who effectively &quot;took over&quot; the restaurant at breakfast time. Appalling table manners, shouting across restaurant repeatedly and leaving food strewn over tables and spilt on the floor did not make for a pleasant and relaxing breakfast experience.In fairness, it did appear that the restaurant staff did their best to cope with the situation over the two days of my stay, but ultmately it appeared there was little that they could do.Fellow guests (who were not part of the coach parties) were openly voicing their discontent to each other, so I do not feel that I was alone with my concerns.Ultimately, I believe that the hotel needs to make a concious decision as to whether they want to attract repeat business travellers and also individual / small groups of private travellers, or whether it intends to seek revenue by accommodating large groups of rowdy, poorly behaved coach parties.My recommendation: avoid"
32,881,"May 19 2009 	Great location comfy room attentive staff -- will stay again!	This was a mixed-purpose visit for us -- my husband had some business meetings to go to and my mother, brother and I used the occasion to have a mini-reunion. This hotel was perfect for us -- centrally located, reasonably priced and with very friendly staff. We had friends join us at the adjoining pub on a couple of occasions and found it to be surprisingly pleasant and cozy. The breakfast was also a surprise -- usually we go out for breakfast when we're staying in London, but we ate in almost every morning. Great selection for both the continental and hot breakfasts. Overall, this hotel had superb value for money. Would definitely recommend!The only negative critique I would have is the price for high-speed internet. We were there for 6 nights and at 10/day we chose not to use it as much as we would have liked. A weekly rate would have been appreciated."
33,881,"May 16 2009 	Nice Clean Hotel..Friendly Helpful Staff..Great Location	I was visiting family staying in London in the Islington area, so I was hopeful to find a reasonable priced hotel in that particular area. Fortunately, this hotel met my location requirements. I found it very clean with an extremely helpful staff. The management and front desk staff are top-notch. They appear to truly want you to have an enjoyable stay (which I did!). This hotel is conveniently located to the Angel tube stop. I highly recommend this establishment. While staying there, I had the opportunity to meet both managers, and was very impressed. Thanks to everyone at the Jurys Inn Islington for making my visit enjoyable!"
34,881,"May 14 2009 	Disappointing	Very handy Kings Cross/ St Pancras. Room grubby looking, top bed cover wanted cleaning also carpet, or at least a good hoover. TV, tea/coffee making, bathroom OK. Had a meal in adjoining restaurant, good and reasonably priced, breakfast was quite good. Staff pleasant.Booked through Superbreak, Paid 117 for B&amp;B for two people +17.50 p.p to upgrade to DB&amp;B, but were told our allowance was 15 p.p, usually when you pay in advance you save money, so be warned."
35,881,"May 5 2009 	Awful - needs an upgrade	I appreciate London hotels are a little more pricey, but this hotel needed a revamp. The rooms are very dated.The first room I checked into had no toilet roll and had dirty surfaces. The room looked like it hadn't been hoovered in a while. The management gave me another room - at least it was clean!Its two minutes walk from the tube. Bar even though it wasn't that busy had plates and glasses on empty tables - the whole place could have done with a good clean!! I wouldn't stop here again"
36,881,"May 5 2009 	CHEAP AND NASTY	Everything about Jury's Inn in Islington is cheap and nasty the room overlooked a car-park and was really noisy, the furniture outdated.The staff are friendly and did open a bottle of wine for me and they were very friendly also and the location is very close to Angel tube station"
37,881,"Apr 19 2009 	Great hotel and great location	10 of us booked this hotel for 2 nights from the 15th of April to the 17th. There was a bit of confusion when we checked in at midnight when it appeared that one of our rooms had been accidentally cancelled but this was sorted out reasonably quickly. The rooms were quite big and the double rooms all appeared to have a double bed and single bed in each room, which was surprising since we had heard that rooms in London were generally quite small. One of the rooms was a family room for 2 adults and 2 children on a separate floor and on the first night there was quite a lot of noise from football supporters that were staying on that floor. The next morning we complained about this and were moved straight away to a different floor and to a much larger room, so no complaints there. The hotel was about two minutes walk from the nearest train station, the bus stop was right around the corner and there were quite a few cafes and bars close by so the location was excellent. The hotel bar was also quite nice to sit in and grab a bite to eat. Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and would stay again. Only (small) complaint is that breakfast is a bit pricey, it wasn't included in our rate of 89 pounds per room per night, but since we were quite pleased with the price we didn't really mind that much and so we had breakfast at cafes close by instead."
38,881,"Apr 15 2009 	Its clean comfortable and in great location	I am in room 542 presently and cant complain! I have no idea what people are on about complaining. Its simply decorated in the rooms, but clean and comfy and modern. Infact, its a bargain for such comfort in London town. The front desk staff are brilliant.I wandered outside the hotel to grab some food and see what was happening and there is a bustle of high street shops, a market and some cheap eateries. One i have to mention, that i have just finished quaffing is the Tortilla, a kind of mexican Subway. Yummy and cheap burritos and half the cost.The cinema is a 5 min walk, as is the buslte of shops including Karen Milen, Gap etc.The only quarm i have, is the internet access is 10 for 24hrs. Lucky im on business and work will pay when get back. Great hotel and great location. I will come here with my partner for pleasure at some point soon."
39,881,"Apr 14 2009 	No close Parking and Decor resembled an old peoples Home!	Didnt stay for the purpose of the London sights, only for close proximity to Islington which in itself is a nice little area. Nevertheless we knew there wouldnt be any parking but was advised that parking was &quot; Nearby&quot; [HA] On arrival we 'popped' in to ask where exactly the 'nearby' parking was and was given directions 'around the block' [HA] After two wrong turnings that took us the length and breadth of Islington we eventually found an underground car park that displayed the sign &quot; Full&quot;...Great. proceeded to look for an alternative- couldnt find one, so decided to give the last one a try...success. Worn out, stressed and forlorn we had to walk all the way back to the Hotel with all our bags- ten minute walk. Not something you want to have to do after encountering a 2 hour journey and London Traffic.Reception staff not very sympathetic..if anything found our little dilemma amusing .We had spent the night previously at a Copthorne Hotel in Windsor for 56, which for the price was absolutely fantastic, including a Car park on site, and beautiful rooms etc.Which was why , when the doors of the Jurys lifts opened we couldnt believe it. Had we walked into a time warp or was the Old Peoples Home decor what they intended?I completely agree with the critique of IHearttravel79 before me that it really did resemble the coridoors of a hospital or prison!! The room was even worse!- was it decorated in 1987? it was spoilt by the fact that they had put an extra 'put me up' double bed on the floor next to our small double bed and covered it with an old primative cream blanket...it just looked awkward there on the floor .I must admit Ive stayed at better Travelodges for less money so cant understand how this hotel charges what it does considering its not even really in the centre of town.Nvertheless our breakfast was indeed excellent and made up for the previous gripes, but this was only in preparation for our painful walk back to the car............."
40,881,"Mar 31 2009 	Would not recommend	First impressions of this hotel are great. Good location near to Angel tube, the amenities of High St Islington and very near Kings X / St Pancras station (5-6) in a cab, also the lobby area is nicely furnished with marble floors and large chandelier. Once past the lobby however, it is a different story.We stepped out of the lift onto a corridor, which I immediately said reminded be of a prison or hopsital corridoe....the carpet was old fashioned and the walls tatty and tired, the room doors were painted a nasty green colour that really didnt look good.The room was not much better, a bright red, old carpet greeted us as well as a room that was in desperate need of a make over. It was a corner room that had seen better days in terms of old, shabby decor. THe bathroom was clean, but towels seemed ilke they were years old, greying, thin and hard, as well as quite small.It was not the type of room that you'd like to go back to to 'enjoy' and relax before an evening out, i just wanted to get in and out.Had problem with the hairdryer which kept cutting out after seconds of use (overheating I assume), so had to wait ages for it to 'click' so that it could be used again, only to cut out again - called reception, who promptly brought up a plug in dryer (the one in the roomwas wired into a drawer), which once plugged in and switched on blew up and smoked in my hand I dropped it to the floor where it cntinued smoking and smelt of burnt electricals!! Great!! Staff on reception did not seem to concerned about it, however a new dryer was in the room when we returned from our day out.Overall, not great. Good location, but rooms leave a lot to be desired especially given that the price is not that cheap. Premier Inns I have used are much better for the price, more modern decor etc."
41,881,Mar 29 2009 	Brilliant hotel - staff and room first class	My wife and I have stayed in Jurys Inn Islington in 2006 for an extra four nights after a Trafalgar tour . We could not have been happier with the room and service. In 2007 we stayed there again for two nights pre and and extra four nights post Trafalgar tour. The service had not changed and could not fault the room that we were in. We were put in a corner room on the top floor with a lovely outlook towards the London Eye. The staff were always pleasant and nothing was too much trouble. The location is great with both tube and bus almost outside the front door. We had no complaints about the breakfast of a morning and the meals in the Pub in the evening were first class. Last year unfortunately we had to stay in another hotel chain prior to tour and did not stay in London after tour and we were disappointed with the other hotel.We will be going on tour again in August next year (2010) with Trafalgar tours and will definatey be spending another week post tour at Jurys Inn Islington on a Trafalgar tours week in London. Keep up the good work and we are definately looking forward to staying in the hotel again next year.
42,881,"Mar 29 2009 	nice hotel recommend to anyone	Stayed here for one night (in a theatre package from SHOW AND STAY and could find nothing to complain about, Booked two rooms, both fine, clean and comfortable. Had drinks in bar after theatre show, prices reasonable and bar was really cosy and nice. Would recommend to anyone to stay here ."
43,881,"Mar 13 2009 	Perfect value for money great 	Compared to staff in other British hotels in this price range, the staff of Jurys Inn Islington was simply great; fast, efficient, very friendly and helpful. I'd definitely stay here again."
44,881,"Mar 8 2009 	Excellent Hotel Great Location Modern and Clean!! Recommended!	We stayed at this hotel from 5th-7th March. Our visit to London was to visit the theatre and see some sights :-)We chose Jurys Inn Islington mostly due to its location. Its about a 5 minute walk from Angel tube station which is just one tube stop from Kings Cross St Pancras which was perfect. The local area was good, sainsburys near by which is good for snacks! Lots of other good shops like boots, starbucks, Macdonalds. A little shopping area is nearby. As well as a &quot;The Angel&quot; Weatherspoons pub which is good for cheap good quality food especially breakfast as the hotels is much more expensive!!All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful! Check-in was quick. Our rooms werent ready when we arrived at 1pm but we were able to leave our luggage and come back later which was good. The rooms were modern with a double and single bed. Very clean with usual facilities like phone, tv, hairdryer (very basic I would take your own!!!). Beds very comfy :) Shower is greatttt!! Overall a very good hotel and I would defo recommend it! :-) We will be going back next time we visit London!"
45,881,"Feb 10 2009 	Standard Jurys Fare	This is a standard Jurys Hotel. If you've stayed at a Jury's before this is similar the the rest of them.Large rooms, clean bathroom, decent air conditioning.Breakfast is help yourself buffet style, and the food always looks fresh.The bar shows sports and will show what you request if they have right the channel, prices are about what you'd expect to pay in London.Some of the rooms can be a bit noisy during the day, but it goes quiet at night.It's ideal for both business and leisure.The reason I booked it is it's location in Islington. It's not far from the tube station which is only a few stops from the City. It's also handy for Kings Cross and Euston Stations. Islington is a good part of London to stay in with plenty of places to eat and drink with some decent bars to be found.I've stayed here before many times and will no doubt stay here again in the future."
46,881,"Feb 8 2009 	Not a 4 star....	I stayed at the Jury's Islington in Feb 2009 as it was near a gig I was going to in the evening with an old school friend. We booked a twin room, and arranged to meet up with some other friends in town. First impressions were good (nice lobby and speedy check-in). However, things went downhill from then..The room had a nasty musty smell, the twin bed turned out to be a z-bed put-you-up (complete with a grim-looking pair of socks under the frame!), and there was only one set of towels...When my friend tried to check in later, he was told that I had two sets of room keys (which I didn't), so he had to leave his bag in reception.Post gig, we found out that the z bed didn't come with any bedding, so we had to wait for housekeeping to sort this out.Definately worse value for money than a premier travel inn (which are usually clean and smell-free)"
47,881,"Jan 27 2009 	Will definitely go back!	Stayed with my sisters in a triple room both January this year and January last year for three nights each time. Found the hotel to be ideally located, clean, comfortable and perfect for what we wanted. This year we even checked into our room a few hours early and there was no problem. Staff were very helpful. Bar food was gorgeous although we never used the restaurant. Will definitely go back!"
48,881,"Jan 24 2009 	Good hotel for good price!!	Stayed at the Jury's Inn in Islington for one night and had no problems at all....Check in staff were helpful, friendly, efficient in their jobs and good at dealing with their customers requests.Rooms were clean, spacious, tidy and well served their purpose. Breakfast was of good quality and restaurant staff were more than helpful.Business Design Centre literally 5 minute walk away so was perfectly positioned for what we needed it for.Would definately use this hotel again!!"
49,881,"Jan 16 2009 	Value for money	We have stayed in this hotel twice and found it excellent value for money, expecially for a city like London( booked through superbreak both times).The staff we encontered were pleasant and efficient , the rooms are of a good size and are spotlessly clean ,the bathroom is pretty basic but does the job.There is a good choice in both the cooked and continetal Breakfast buffett ( can be slightly haphazard though as they are slow in replenishing items which they have run out off)The location is only a couple of minutes walk to Angel Tube and about ten to Kings Cross and there are plenty of bars, restaurants ,shops and cafes in close proximity"
50,881,Dec 27 2008 	Great hotel	Lovely hotel with nice rooms. It's expensive but everything in London is. The room was lovely. It wasn't a huge room but normal standards but bigger than what you would normally get in London. The staff were excellent. I was able to get into my room hours before check in which was a benefit. It's not far from Angel tube station and it's a very quiet hotel.
51,881,Dec 7 2008 	best service with affordable price	the room was clean and the staff very friendly. Overall I would say this is probably one of the best hotel in London with the price of Pound 70.00 pernight.
52,881,Nov 17 2008 	weekend break	booked a week-end through superbreak. The hotel was excellent the rooms were clean and comfortable.The breakfast was more than adequate with plenty of choice both continental and full english.We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful and enjoyed our stay. The hotel is well place for public transport into central london. We would certainly stay here again.
53,881,Nov 17 2008 	Clean hotel	I stayed in Jurys fron the 14th until the 16th November. I found the rooms to be clean and the price 99 for 2 nights was good. At check inn i didnt find the female receptionint very friendly but having spoken to 3 male receptionists i found that they were very nice and professional. I had a problem with the shower and when i reported it they sorted it out straight away. The bar was clean but the staff were not very friendly or chatty and we were waiting for over 15 minutes to order food so we went elsewhere. I would recommend it for basic accomodation and if you are planning to go shopping
54,881,"Nov 17 2008	Nice Hotel shame about the poor service	Nice clean Hotel with some very friendly staff. We asked for a quiet room and got one at the back of the Hotel, albeit overlooking big piles of bin bags and the place where staff stood around to smoke.The plug in the hand basin was one of the metal ones integrated into the plug hole and annoyingly kept getting stuck solid. The Hotel handyman freed it once but then it got stuck again about five minutes after he left. We ended up having to use the bath to wash our hands!On our last day our room wasn't cleaned. We left our room to go shopping at 10.00am and said good morning to the chamber maid as we left. On our return at 4.00pm we found that the chamber maid we had greeted as we left hadn't serviced our room! I called reception to ask that our room be serviced.Reception called back to say that the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign was on our door and that was why our room wasn't serviced. After pointing out that this was NOT correct and insisting the room was cleaned we were offered another room! After persisting that our room be cleaned, a very apologetic housekeeper turned up with a cleaner to sort our room out. We decided to go the Hotel bar for a drink while our room was cleaned.The bar was empty apart from a family enjoying some fish and chips. There were empty glasses on the bar and on the tables too. No bar staff in sight. We waited and waited, popped our heads around the doors and despite three staff at reception enjoying some social chit chat with the handyman, no one seemed to want to come and serve us. We gave up and sat in reception waiting for our room to be cleaned.So if you want a clean basic Hotel with poor service go here, if you want a Hotel that makes you feel welcome go somewhere else!"
55,881,"Nov 14 2008 	handy and pleasant hotel in London	Although next to a busy road this is a quiet place and requesting a room at the back is a good idea as its even quieter there ! Spacious accommodation in the double room with table and chairs too. Nice public area and good restuarant area for breakfast. Adequate continetal breakfast although my husband did not like the coffee. The &quot; pub &quot; food was not so good, rather bland and a long wait for a simple dish of fish and chips ! Walk over the road and get the 73 bus to Kings Cross or to Euston, they arrive every few minutes and drop you back at the hotel on the return journey. Handy for restaurants and for general travel in London. No free wi fi but very cheap internet cafe just up the road."
56,881,"Nov 14 2008 	What it says on the tin..	Stayed at the Jury's inn for a night in November, on business, as the normal hotel was fully booked.Front desk service was polite, excellent and efficient.In general it was exactly what was expected - normal standard 3* hotel room, basic ensuite with tea and coffee facilities. If you just want a base without any luxury frills, this is the place for you.The only complaint was the noise of the air-con system but i just used it to heat the room up and switched it off when i wanted to sleep.Ate in the attached pub at night, food was fine, typical pub fayre and not overpriced in the context of the capital.Handy for the tube station (Angel) which is just down the road and equal distance between Euston/King Cross and the City which left it perfectly placed for my requirements.All in all would recommend as a suitable trip for a short business/leisure trip for those not concerned about frills!"
57,881,"Oct 31 2008 	Room overlooked by office workers!	Booked through Superbreak - I expected Jurys to be bog standard, ensuite, TV and kettle type of room, which is what i wanted. It was clean and tidy with all usual things supplied.The breakfast was a buffet style, with both continental and cooked to choose from, although had some odd arrangement with a token that was given to me for cooked breakfast which i then gave back to man who issued it to me - not sure of the point of that? Anyway food was good and plenty of it.Only real problems were that the room was cold and the air conditioning unit was complicated to work out - lots of symbols but no proper instructions on how to encourage heat rather than freezing air to blast into room. The towels were bit scratchy too and the sink had a crack - but could live with that.What really shocked me was that in morning when i opened curtains (i arrived at night - curtains already closed) was that i was directly opposite a huge glass fronted office - with people facing me looking at me! There are no net curtains in room and absolutly no privacy. Luckily i was wearing clothes!! There must be rooms at back of building but no idea what is facing them?i would return but not in the rooms at front of building."
58,881,"Oct 28 2008	Very clean and quiet hotel	Stayed here for one night and was very impressed. 2 minute walk from Angel tube station. The room we had was very quiet on the side of the hotel (overlooking an office car park) and was very clean and offered everything we needed. The beds were really comfortable, the shower was first class and the breakfast was good quality and good value for money.Overall this was a very good value hotel and I would highly recommend it."
59,881,"Oct 27 2008 	Highly Reccomended	Its a great deal in London, would go there again.."
60,881,Oct 7 2008	Great	Great hotel. Very clean. Close to Angel tube. Good Breakfast. I recommend it especially for the reasonable prices.
61,881,"Oct 5 2008 	Very Nice Hotel	You know what your going to get with a Jurys Hotel and this one is very good.The hotel was very clean, in a decent location less than 5 mins walk from Angel tube and about 10 mins walk from Kings Cross.You can get in to Central London in 10/15 mins on the tube.The rooms are good, the usual Jurys standard. The prices are usually good if you can get a deal, which is not always possible. I booked through hotelconnect.co.uk.The breakfast selection is also very good, if you book with the continental breakfast included, you can get the full hot breakfast for an additional 2.50, which is good. If you don't want to eat at the hotel, there are a lot of places locally to eat and drink.I would encourage anybody to stay here, its more than adequate for a London hotel."
62,881,"Sep 24 2008 	Excellent value if you can get a deal	We got a great deal through otel.com which was 20 pounds cheaper per night than the price on the jury's inn website. At this price it was great value for money.Large size rooms for London with a full size ensuite with bath. Continental Breakfast was included and was fine, it was very cheap to upgrade to cooked breakfast if required.Location was great, not far from Angel tube. Plenty of buses also in all directions.For the price we paid this was great value - we have paid more for much less in King's Cross. Staff were helpful and the room spotless each day."
63,881,"Sep 17 2008 	Exactly what we wanted	I travelled to London in July of this year for a girls weekend of shopping, seeing a show and doing all the touristy stuff.We got a good deal on a triple room in the Jurys and were pleased to find that it was reasonably spacious, with comfy beds and a good powerful shower - all must-haves when 3 girls are on holiday together!!The hotel is in a nice leafy area of the city and the closest tube station, Angel, is only a few minutes walk away. There is also a nice bar just next door with a roof terrace.We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as we wanted to explore the nearby cafes.The reception staff were very helpful as were the bar staff.I would recommend this hotel as it would be easy to get ripped off in London and this place strikes the balance between cost and comfort."
64,881,"Sep 15 2008 	Visiting the Capital	We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August. The hotel is in a good location 10 minutes walk from Kings Cross Station. The room was fresh, spacious, well equipped and clean. The hotel was nice and quiet. Breakfast was a buffet and the food was nice and there was plenty of it. We did not rate the ticket service at breakfast as this made it feel impersonal. We would have preferred traditional table service rather than a buffet but for the price we cannot complain!Overall we had a very pleasant stay at Jurys Inn and will be considering staying at one of their other hotels when we go on other city breaks."
65,881,"Aug 25 2008 	Fab Hotel Fab Staff Fab Location Stay Here !!!!	dear all, please dont be put off by some comments on here, i have just returned from a 2 night break at this hotel, and i have to say we were totally happy with our stay from beginnng to endwe arrived on saturday at approx 12 noon, check in was quick and efficient, i was greeted by Amit on the reception desk, now i had booked myself and my husband in for 2 nights and our friends for the 1 night, we did arrive early before checkin at 2pm, and we asked if we could have a room at this time 12pm, firstly we were told no rooms available, but then yes we could have a room at this time, which really pleased us as we were going to a matinee perfomance of dirty dancing so needed to freshen up, we were both on the 2nd floor, the rooms were lovely, spacious, clean, air con was a blessing, bedding clean and fresh, towels clean and the bed was so comfy !! the staff here are very pleasant and will do anything to help you, the location is brill just a few mins walk to angel tube, felt .safe in this locationthe only downside i would say is the cost of the breakfast 9.95 ea we normally wouldnt pay this, but hey ho its London ! think they should include breakfast like xpress hol inn but never mind what we had we really enjoyed all was cooked cant complain reallyall in all a great hotel great location and i wouldnt hesitate at all to return to jurys islington, infact its the only hotel i would stay again in London !!! well done Jurys ! :-) we will be back !Dawn Webb,Yorkshire"
66,881,"Aug 21 2008 	Ok if you don't stay at the top floor.	I went to London to attend a conference at the Business Design Centre (BDC). I chose Jury's Inn Islington because it was the nearest affordable hotel. I could walk from there to the BDC in 5 to 10min and also to the Angel Tube Station in 5min. The other option was the priciest Hilton which is door to door to the BDC.When I got there late night and after a 4 hour trip (plane, heathrow express and tube) I was a little bit tired and I just wanted to go to my room. However the recepcionist didn't find my reservation and politely asked me to &quot; wait by the bar where I could eat something&quot; while they would solve the mistery of the missing reservation. First problem... But ok, it happens! After 10 minutes or so I was told that there had been a problem with my reservation but they managed to get me a room and I was sent to the top floor. I finished my quick meal at the bar and headed to my room.The room was ok and met my expectations with the exception of the old CRT TV... I don't know about you but I'm less and less used to see that kind of TVs in hotels. I noticed the air conditioning was making some noise but I could live whith that too. I watched some TV, prepared myself for the conference and then I went to bed. Lights off! Ok... Sweet dreams... Wrong! The air conditioning was turned on and it was noisy! Lights on! Get up! Air conditioning off! Go to bed! Lights off! Sweet dreams... Wrong again! The noise was still there but the air conditioning was off! This is a problem... I decided to try to sleep anyway and if I failed to achieve it in the next half an hour I would have to go to plan B: get up, get dressed , pack everything and ask for another room which probably they wouldn't have. Not a great plan... Zzzz...Next morning I found out there was a big air conditioning system just above my room (check the photos) which was responsible for all that noise! I left in a hurry after breakfast (nice!) and I thought I would ask them to move me to a different room as soon as I would get back from the conference. During the conference I met a guy from Islington chain and I told him about this. He apologized for the inconvenience. It's ok, I said! After the conference I went for a walk and arrived once again quite late at the hotel. I decided it was too late to switch rooms and as I was very tired I would probably fell asleep just like the day before. And so it was... Zzzz.... My last noisy night there!While doing the check out during next morning the recepcionist called the duty manager because someone had told him I had some problems during my stay. The nice guy at the conference had warned him/them. I told him my story and he said they were sorry about it and I was free to go because everything else had been taken care. They didn't give me the traditional invoice and as I didn't asked for it I thought they wouldn't charge me because of all that had happened. A few weeks later my credit card was charged and I had to request the invoice to justify the expense.My overall experience wasn't terrible so I guess I have to rate it as &quot;Okay, but some problems - if you stay at the top floor&quot;. I won't say I won't stay there again because as I said before the hotel is well situated and affordable and probably I was very unlucky with my room."
67,881,Aug 16 2008 	BASIC HOTEL MAINLY FOR TOURISTS	Stayed here for one night and would agree for tourists is ideal for location and transport.Clean and basic with local bars &amp; eateries and bar inside.We had booked for a theatre break(hotel choice was not ours) but was disappointed with our location as cost  15 to get to theatre-didnt fancy tube late at night!Limited menu and breakfast was not great-continental was a choice of 2 roll choices or mini croissant with no slices of cheese or meats etc-worst I have had in a hotel-so if not part of package go elsewhere!!Would recommend an hotel nearer to town-both for UK and overseas visitors.
68,881,"Aug 13 2008 	Is the Jury Inn or Out?	I stayed here a few weeks on a business trip. The hotel was comfortable but not particularly memorable. Location is convenient for Angel tube on the Northern Line - and a short ride from connections to other lines at King's Cross or Bank.The front of the hotel is on a busy road, I suggest asking for a room at the back where traffic noise is minimal. Mine was bright, was not overlooked and had a view clean. However this will on your position in the U-shaped building.The room was clean, and was kept clean. Walls are not completely soundproof - loud music from a neighbour troubled me twice but in general the hotel is quiet.Room temperature was fine and there is air-conditioning. the bed was comfortable except the pillows were to skinny. The coat hangars were the annoying hotel-type so you can't easily hang a jacket or short in a steamy bathroom to get rid of creases. Why do hotels do that ? Are hangars really so expensive? - Otherwise dry cleaners wouldn't give them away.The biggest shortfall in the room is the lack of a fridge - for a long stay in future this would lead me to look elsewhere. There was a kettle, tea, coffee and UHT milk,The (wired) broadband internet in the room was GBP 10 for 24 hours - a reasonable rate if you are using it frequently for business. I was double-charged for one day - watch out for this on your bill. The connection was fast enough for streaming video. For the techies amongst you - no smtp email server address is provided so you might have to your outbound emailing using webmail.The TV was the old fashioned CRT type taking up a lot of desk space and had only a few channels. There was no radio in the room - no way to listen to the BBC except via computer if you have one.The bathroom was clean. The shower is the in-bath type - and consequently rather cramped and inconvenient. The contorl was very hard to turn off - when wet it required forceful use of two hands. There was no wash-cloth, and the towels were very thin.My key became disabled twice and I had to traipse back down to reception to get it restored. Laundry was return promptly the same day. However the room cleaner usually forgot to supply a new laundry bag and form, which meant I had to raid the cleaning carts or visit the front desk. The only cleaner that I discussed this with spoke no English.The buffet breakfast is Ok for variety - but had the worst, diluted orange juice I've tasted in a long time and was barely drinkable. Why they had to cut costs here I don't know. Free newspapers (Daily Telegraph) were available at breakfast. The dining room is rather soulless and I didn't try it for dinner or lunch. The Inn has no real ale and I didn't eat there either. Meals were not available after 10pm.On the bright side, there are good dining options nearby - the best being Rooburoo - just at the end of the side street adjoining Jury's Inn. (I made repeated visits there) There are also several pubs within 2 minutes of the hotel, and one immediately next door. There is a Sainsburys supermarket in the backstreets and plenety of other shopping and dining on or near Upper Street only 5 minutes walk to the east."
69,881,"Jul 29 2008 	Oh Dear	Well I put that we stayed here in July 2008. We did not stay here because they had &quot;overbooked&quot; and therefore made us stay elsewhere..We wanted to stay in London near Kings Cross so we could go to the theatre and then get up really early the next morning and walk down to St Pancreas (King's Cross) to get onto the Eurostar. This was the whole reason we picked this hotel..On arrival, after a nice walk (It was a rather hot day), all we wanted to do was check in, take a shower, grab some food and head off to the theatre to enjoy the evening, before our european break. However the lady looked horrified when we handed over our reservation.. She asked us to sit down on the seats and she would be right with us. The manager than came over and gave an excuse that the computer system was down, and that they had overbooked.We had booked weeks in advance, so were a little confused. Maybe because we got there around 4ish (Train was delayed into London by 2 hours) they simply decided they could check someone else in.. This was a real pain, as we were hot and bothered and wanted to get something to eat. They said that they would book us into another hotel 10 minutes away, and upgrade us to get a breakfast (which we wouldn't be able to eat anyway because of the check out). We managed to get to get them to give us a free taxi into the City and to the train station the next morning, however we were left with a 25 bill from the City to hotel after the theatre. This is rather a lot when it wasn't budgeted.The hotel that they moved us too was called the Day's Hotel, which was rather nice, however more than about 20 minutes from Kings Cross. So we needed to get up earlier etc. This was a real nuisance to be honest, and when we got to the Day's Hotel they said they didn't know anything about the free taxi's, so we needed to ring the Jury's Inn Hotel back up (After asking the new hotel for the telephone number), to try and get a taxi. We felt like we were stranded in a part of London that we had never been too.We would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I understand these things happen, however moving us out of the area we had planned to stay in caused as a few pains, and since it was a short stay it compacted it even more. If we were staying in London for longer, this mix up would have cost us a substantial amount more simply to travel where we would want to go."
70,881,"Jul 19 2008 	Comfortable room and just what we expected for the price	Stayed here 3 nights midweek in July with my teenaged son who was in London for some work experience. Having read these reviews carefully, I confirmed my booking the day before and requested a quiet room. Check in was swift and efficient and we were given a room at the back of the hotel, so no view, but it was quiet for a London hotel. I had contacted the hotel directly to make the booking and paid 129 a night for the room, but couldn't find a better deal elsewhere as the hotel was full.The room had two beds, which were comfortable with white linen and duvets. The room and bathroom were clean, with freshly painted walls, plain tiles in the bathroom. It had tea/coffee making and TV with limited number of chanels. Internet wi-fi was available at a cost. The airconditioning worked fine. The room was nothing fancy, but a good standard and all that we required. This is not a luxury hotel so there is no room service, but the housekeeping provided an ironing board and iron as soon as I requested.We were pushed for time and didn't feel like eating breakfast, so we bought some food from the Sainsburys supermarket which is a short walk away and ate it in the room. On two evenings we ate locally on Upper Street. First night at The Fine Burger Co, a little place more like a cafe than a restaurant, but with good, homemade burgers, fries and salad, very wholesome and tasty - recommended. Second night we chose an Italian Restaurant called Ask, which served good food in large portions, perhaps not very memorable but nothing to fault. Lots and lots of restaurants of all descriptions to try in Islington, as well as branch of M&amp;S and Sainsburys very close.I had chosen this hotel to be near Kings Cross, with good public transport links to the City and Canary Wharf. Angel Tube station is two short blocks away. I liked this hotel. It met all my requirements. It was clean, comfortable, the staff pleasant, and I felt safe in the immediate surroundings, even if Upper Street seems incredibly busy and cosmopolitan when you come from rural Scotland. There are good tube links to the City, Thames Embankment, and the West End. I was pleased with my choice."
71,881,"Jul 18 2008 	Great Value Convenient to Tube Nice Neighborhood	I and my teenage son and daughter stayed here Sat-Fri (Jun 28-Jul 4, 2008). Booked it last fall for 75 pounds/night. Daughter used one full-size bed - son and I shared the other. We were on 3rd floor in back and it was quiet. The hotel was a lot more modern than I was expecting for the price. It was clean and staff were courteous - helped my make a call at front desk to confirm airline flight. One can walk to King's Cross/St. Pancras station in about 15 minutes or walk 5 minutes to the convenient Angel Tube Station. Found numerous delis, bakeries, grocery stores two blocks north on Chapel Market street. Islington High Street/Upper Street (near the Angel Tube station and going north from there) felt safe - just folks out enjoying themselves in the neighborhood. With the value of this hotel, location to Tube, and 7-day Oyster passes for Tube, we were easily able to get around London for the week."
72,881,"Jul 16 2008 	Great stay	Recently stayed in this hotel for two nights. Reception staff were very welcoming, efficient and helpful. The bedroom room was large, comfortable, very clean and quiet. Excellent air conditioning. A very good breakfast is supplied. Close to Saddlers Wells Theatre and the Angel tube station. There is a pub attached to the hotel which is useful when arriving in late. I really enjoyed this hotel."
73,881,Jul 13 2008 	Noisey - don't stay here if you want to sleep	The location is good but perhaps that is why we got no sleep. Young people were partying in the corridor and shouting. Nightporter was ineffective at resolving the problem.
74,881,"Jul 4 2008 	Great Locatioin	The Jury's Inn Islington is about a mile from Kings Cross Train Station (12 min walk) and about a block and a half from the Angel Tube Station. This is why we picked this hotel. We either walked to Kings Cross or used the Tube to see London. It was very convenient. Hotel Pub was very good. Hotel staff was friendly, helpful and professional. No problems, aside from figuring out how to work the shower (just don't turn it on too far). Anyway, a block from the hotel is Upper St. where all the resturants and pubs are located. The area was not threatening, and there was even a Starbucks around the corner (however we could have an interesting discussion on black or white coffee (they pour the milk)). The hotel was basic, nothing special and not a closet. It was clean, functional and it was a great starting point for the day and a good ending point. The only bad thing was that our room was on a side street, which I thought would be ok, however it was busy until 2am (so traffic noise). However, I was so tired from walking for 8-9 hours I only partially noticed it and then went back to sleep. Ear plugs might be the solution, if you are on this side. Otherwise, the hotel was great. We went from London to Scotland, back to London and then did a day trip to Paris. So location was important to us. There is also a Dominos Pizza about a block up the street (one of the best meals we had in London - you don't go for the food)."
75,881,"Jun 8 2008 	Good budget Hotel	We stayed here for 2 nights, Fri and Sat, on bed and breakfast.The rooms were basic, but very clean and comfortable. We had a room on the 5th floor which had good views over the City. Due to an incident late Friday night early Sat morning in the street running alongside the Hotel, we were constantly woken up with the sound of police sirens.Saturday night was much quieter, and slept uninterrupted.Breakfast was, on the whole very good, with a buffet style help your self.The staff were very helpful and cheerful at all times. The deputy Manager in particular was most helpful when we found they had no record of our booking, so a phone call or two later had us booked in. Thanks for that.Will definitely use again when we want to come to London for another show ."
76,881,"Jun 7 2008 	Good value location 	Stayed here for just 1 night with my daughter who was starting a business course the following day. It was a last minute booking as our arrangements had changed, which I made through the hotel website and paid 85 for a triple room which I felt was pretty good value for this part of London. Didn't really know what to expect but I need not have worried, the hotel is very modern/contemporary and kept beautifully clean. Having booked the triple room meant that I got to have the comfortable double bed and my daughter the single - there's got to be some perks for the payer. The rooms are quite spacious and again are modern and clean. We were on the 5th floor and had a pretty good view across this part of London.My only negative comment is that the Inn Bar (which serves very nice &amp; reasonably priced snacks) appears very dingy in comparison to the rest of the hotel - I think this is some sort of concession to the foreign tourists who perhaps expect this sort of thing (e.g the mock antique look).I must though praise the reception staff who really bent over backwards to help. Having arrived quite late in the evening I was a bit concerned about where I would be able to park my car but the young lady who dealt with us had words with someone in the office and I was allowed to park in the staff car park to the rear overnight and as my daughter was staying with another group from the following day it was arranged so that she could remain in the same room that we had both occupied - First Class service for which I thank you very much."
77,881,"Jun 2 2008 	Good value for London	My daughter and I took a trip to London in April to go to a show, shop and eat in Fifteen ... we wanted a decent hotel which was accessible and represented value for money ... as with other Jury's Inns, the Islington property does exactly what it is supposed to. No frills, friendly welcoming staff, clean well maintained room, decent breakfast ..."
78,881,"Jun 1 2008 	over priced	We stayed at the hotel one night to go to the Bruce Springsteen concert, so didnt spend alot of time in the hotel. The room was large and clean, and the bar and reception areas were pleasent.However I did think that 129 for a room with no breakfast was a little high, even for London. We recently stayed at a hotel of similar rating on the Strand, which is a far better location, yet is 10 cheaper and included a brilliant breakfast. Both hotels were booked through the hotels web site's with no special offers.We had a problem with obtaining the discounted parking rate and I am awaiting a response from the hotel, but be wary if going at a weekend."
79,881,"May 30 2008 	great place	The staff at jurys islington is very accommodating. Our travel agent told us that she booked us there including our continental breakfast, but apparently that was not the case. Jury's staff was very accomodating and helped us figure out the problem. The rooms are nice and clean, spacious. They also have tea in the rooms. The hotel is a couple blocks away from the tube which worked out great for us. The staff and the accomodations are wonderful."
80,881,"May 26 2008 	Clean and modern with good service.	I stayed here on 24th May for a romantic break with my husband and we were wary about what to expect since many London hotels often have very poky rooms. However, I was very pleasantly surpirsed by everything about this hotel. It is a 10 minute walk from Angel tube and the short cut takes you through the bustling Chapel Market in Islington and is very near shops and bars. The reception area was bright and modern and the staff checked me in efficiently with no waiting around. Service was polite and friendly and I was on my way to my room in seconds. We had a fourth floor room which was surprisingly large with a double and a single bed. The en suite bathroom was clean and white and my only criticism is that there were only soap dispensers, no shampoo, so remember to take some. There is also tea and coffee making facilities and a hairdryer. There were about 9 TV channels and radio stations and beds had crisp white sheets. Breakfast was the usual hotel fare- full English breakfast buffet and cereals/pastries/ fruit etc. Very impressed for the money we paid and liked the large room with a semi picturesque-ish view over Northern London. We paid 54 each including breakfast and considered it value for money."
81,881,May 22 2008 	nothing exceptional and overpriced	stayed overnight the hotel was fine but nothing exceptional my name was mispelled and they could not find my reservation eventually all was ok the hotel had obviously some operational problems as the food and beverage manager was doing check in at the reception and there were lots of &quot;graduates&quot; in the hotel - this is a new job description for hotels Single room was small breakfast was rich but not spectacular Pub next to the lobby looked inviting for 135 B&amp;B i found it overpriced - but this is london Broadband in rooms 5 per hour 10 per dayBUT I am really impressed by the management responses on tripadvisor complaints - clearly the Deputy GM is listening and responding - but it is evident that there are operational issues So all in all s
82,881,"May 17 2008 	Staff let the hotel down	I've stayed at the Jurys Inn several times, mainly due to the locality to particular events.I asked the hotel to book a cab for us at around 5am as we needed to get the Eurostar, and was told, no problem, all done cab will be here at 5. When we got up in the morning, we found that no cab had been booked, and when they went to do it, there was a delay, we ended up getting a black cab, not that easy at that time of the morning, rushing around and nearly missing our train. Exactly what we'd tried to avoid. We just wish they'd been honest with us when I'd asked about booking a cab the night before.Staff let the place down.Other than that, standard chain hotel, clean rooms, good location."
83,881,"May 16 2008 	Great hotel great staff great location...	Stayed here twice now, loved it both times.The location is great, just outside of the busy centre part of the city, a short walk from the Angel tube station, only a short ride from Leicester Square, Oxford Street, The London Eye, The Zoo, The Aquarium, and so on... Our stay included Continental Breakfast, there were 4 of us and 2 of us upgraded to Full English each day for 2,50 p/p so we could share the eggs, tomatoes, bacon, etc. The breakfast lady always told us we could go back to the buffet to get some more if we weren't full yet, even though the 2,50 was only supposed to be for 1 plate of food. Food tasted good, always fresh fruit, plenty of cereals, cheeses, yoghurt, bread, etc.The rooms were clean, cleaners did an excellent job on keeping our rooms clean, changing the sheets every other day... The only remark I have here is that apparently not all cleaning ladies know about the fact that the hotel asks their guests not to throw newspapers in the bin... because when you put the papers next to it or even put the bin on top of the papers they simply just leave them there.Was a bit dissappointed at the lack of little soaps, shampoos, etc.We were lucky enough to get rooms facing the main street, so we had a pretty nice view. I've read comments of people complaining about the police/ambulance-sirens, but I can't say I really found the sirens disturbing.The entire hotel was very well maintained, very clean, and all staff members were very friendly and helpful.Another big plus for us was that when we got there at 11AM both of our rooms were ready, even though &quot;offically&quot; your room doesn't have to be ready until 3PM.All in all we had a great stay and would definately stay here again."
84,881,"May 7 2008 	OK hotel	I have stayed at this hotel before and knew it was an ok hotel I'd come to. The stay itself was good, but the shower was a bit broken (could not adjust the height). You could not combine hot and cold water in the washbasin either because it had two single taps. So the main disappointment with the stay was the bathroom. I think the bathroom was ment for wheelchair users too because of the armrests beside the tolilet and the very low sink. We had not booked a wheelchair friendly room, so this was weird.The rest of the stay (service, area, breakfast etc) was good."
85,881,"Apr 23 2008 	Great Location great deal!	Booked this through lastminute.com - one of their 'top secret hotels' 3* in islington - slipped up by saying the bay was called The INN! googled it and found it to be the Jurys InnWe got it for 100 a night and it included full english breakfast AND evening meal! for two people! the breakfast should have been 15 each and evening meal (2 courses) should have been about 45 - we stayed two nights as well. Bargain we thought.Room was really big, although the bed quite small for such a big room! nice and clean and bathroom spotless, great shower.There was some noise from drunken people on the friday but not the hotels fault and didnt last long.Great location for Angel tube and 5 in taxi from Euston - 5 mins walk from Kings Cross too.Would definitely stay here again! Friendly staff, pub was good for watching the football before we left on our last day too."
86,881,"Mar 30 2008 	Clean comfortable convenient .	I spent Easter here with my partner and teenage son, my son was most impressed to see members of a band he had just been reading about in New Musical Express hanging about in the lobby! Easy to travel about London from - buses and tube stations very close by. The staff were friendly and helpful.The only problem we had was with the booking - it may have been my fault, but I had booked on the hotels website and hadnt noticed that I hadnt had any confirmation.......so when I rang on the day we were to arrive I discovered that there was no record of our booking - for some reason it hadnt gone through (as I said above, it could easily have been my fault not theirs!). Luckily they fitted us in at the price we would have paid, but would advise making sure you have got a confirmation that you have actually booked!!"
87,881,"Mar 25 2008 	Comfortable and in a good loaction	Check-in was friendly and quick, the room was nothing to write home about, but of a good standard. A pleasant view over London and a decent shower made up for the slightly tired-looking bathroom.For the price I paid, I have no complaints. The room was spacious, the bed comfortable and the aircon responsive and quick to warm the room up after a night sleeping with the window open."
88,881,"Mar 19 2008 	Eventually a Pleasant Stay	After two room moves, which were arranged in good spirits, had a pleasant overnight stay in a remarkably quiet (for London) hotel. Great location for the Angel on the Northern Line and Bus Services. Room was clean and to an accepteble standard with white towels (not too thin). Bed was comfortable although the same can't be said for the pillows which were thin and lumpy. Standard buffet style breakfast was uninspiring but plenty of it."
89,881,"Feb 26 2008 	Good value for London	Visited London for midweek break. Hotel basic but clean. Speedy check in and friendly staff. Area is very safe at night. Did not eat in hotel, however number of restaurants on Islington High Street which is no more than 5 minutes walk from hotel. If possible request a room away from the front of the hotel on Pentonville Road as can get very noisy especially with police car sirens throughout the night. Angel tube station minutes away from hotel and no more than 15 minutes walk to Kings Cross / St Pancras station. Well worth the charge of 75.00 per night and would definately stay again when in London."
90,881,"Feb 24 2008 	It'll do - but certainly nothing special...	I stayed here for business when attending an awards ceeremony in central london - i picked the short straw as some of my colleagues stayed at The Cumberland. Nothing awful about the hotel, just a bog standard hotel, no frills or whistles but clean and has everything you need.I was less impressed with breakfast though - was booked in on a B&amp;B rate but the gent at the entrance to the doorway insisted i was not and i would have to pay extra...i just said ok as knew i had a copy of my booking confirmation so would fight it out on check out if needs be...but once inthe 'restaurant' feels much more like a canteen than a hotel - tables are bare and you even have to collect cutlery, napkins, sugars...well everything. Food itself was fine, just reminded me of my uni refectory..."
91,881,"Feb 17 2008 	For London excellent	This hotel gets all the basics right and I got a good night's sleep. My only gripe was that the bathroom was a bit smelly, although everything looked clean.After shopping around various websites, I found a pretty reasonable rate.If you don't know London, this is a good area with good transport links."
92,881,"Feb 15 2008 	Great Hotel	I stayed at this hotel in February on a trip with my family and after a long and tiring trip we were cheered by the friendly staff that greeted us upon our arrival.Check in was very efficient and the staff were friendly and explained all our dining options and details about the rooms. The rooms were a good size, spotlessly clean and there were plenty of towels.We used the bar in the hotel twice and both times the service was again efficient and friendly and the food was a very good quality hearty meal. We didnt eat in the restaurant as there are lots of resturants near the hotel as it has a good location to Upper Street, however the restaurant looked modern and was busy( normally a god sign!!!!)I look forward to staying again at this qualiy hotel in the near future."
93,881,"Feb 12 2008	Solid Value 	- Great location near the Angel stop on the Northern line- plenty of excellent places to eat and drink near this hotel- centrally located, but away from heavy tourist areas- I lived at this hotel for about 8-9 weeks- reasonably clean- breakfast was average- it is not the hilton at islington which is lots more $$$- but it is not the hilton at euston which is worse- in the US this would not be 3 stars, but if you need location, affordability and decent room sizes this is it"
94,881,"Feb 11 2008 	So so	I stayed here for a night on business. Jury's Islington is in a great location and very close to the Angel tube station, but the carpark is a good walk away from the hotel. Reception and the bar and restaurant downstairs are clean and modern, but stepping out of the lift on the 3rd floor was like walking back into the 1970's. Very old fashioned decor going on! The room was clean and well furnished but again was dated and the bathroom was akin to that of an older Travelodge.My room overlooked the carpark belonging to next door's block of flats, but I got a good night's sleep. My colleague had a room overlooking Pentonville Road and was awoken twice during the night by police cars going past, sirens screaming.My television did not work - no picture. When I pointed this out to reception the following morning I was advised that the cleaner sometimes knocks a cable out when dusting and I should have had a look and tried to put it back in....!I would stay here again on business if I had to, but 129 a night excluding breakfast is poor value for what you actually get and if I was paying myself, I'd look to stay somwhere else."
95,881,"Feb 3 2008 	Not Impressed at all	We arrived at around 2.30pm, checked in fine and were allocated room 307, we went onto the 3rd floor there was a nice clean smell in the hotel.As we entered our room the bedding was just dumped on the bed, As we looked around the room there was a bottle of wine and a glass on the desk...this was not a complimentry bottle of wine this was an empty bottle of wine from the previous occupier, The room had not even been attended to so was left how the prev occupants left it. (SEE PHOTO'S)I rang reception and they told us to return to reception, we were then allocated room 303 on the same floor.We got into the room and there was no electricity..again we called reception and were advised to put our room card in the small white box as near the front door, we done this and then after 5 mins it went off again..as we were on our way out we asked reception about this and then they informed us that we had to leave the card in there for the duration of the time that we were there.I spoke to the manager about the issue of our initial room not being ready, she apologies and advised she would investigate this and added complimentry breakfast to our stay as we were room only.The walls are VERY thin, and i could hear the whole convo of the room next door, i even knew when they were having a shower!We were woken by the room next door but one as they seemed to have a little party going on, i knocked there door and told them to keep it down which they did :-)Doors were very heavy so were being slammed at all hours!!The breakfast!!!Was Awful!We were given a ticket which entitled us to ONE full english - every other hotel i have ever stayed in are usually as much as you can eat breakfast buffet.So once you put what you wanted on your plate that was it...no more.And as for the breakfast itself it was awaful, i have never seen so much grease and fat.The Full English breakfast bard consisted of:SAUSAGE: Very greasy, they needed bread at the bottom of the tray to soak up the greaseBACON: This was just in one big heap and all i could see was fat not baconTOMATOESEGGS: Again, very greasyBEANSHASH BROWNS: Very overdone and greasySCRAMBLED EGG: This looked very soggy and mushy  although i helped myself to a plate i really could not eat it so i opted for the continental.there was no-one to assist you at breakfast so we had to try and find our way round.FInally checked out and could not wait to get out of there!This sounds like one big moan but unfortunatly this is how my stay was at the Jury's Inn..Good Points:FREE PARKING :-)"
96,881,"Jan 28 2008 	value hotel	Reception is impressive, rooms are Premier Inn style, functional, clean, average size but bland.We had room 426 with views towards the London Eye and St Pauls, a bit of noise from the road but nothing to keep us awake.Angel tube is just around the corner but the bus was equally as quick, take the 38 or 73 which take you right into the centre of London.At 75.00 a night it was pretty good value, certainlly worth considering for a short stay in Islington, which is a ok place in itself, and only a short ride into town."
97,881,"Jan 21 2008 	Not Great	Booked this hotel as we were going to the emirates stadium. Booked in late, reception were fine got room quickly. The room itself was very very basic, the bed was a small double with terrible quality bedding. No nice soaps, or biscuits!! The walls were very thin, and decor very 80's. Would not stay again, could get somewhere nicer for 85 a night."
98,881,"Jan 7 2008 	good hotel	stayed at the Jurys Inn Islington on 27th Dec for 1 night. The hotel had been shut over Christmas and only re-opened that day. The Reception staff were very efficient and friendly and explained that as the hotel had been shut the rooms would be a little cold. This was not a problem as we simply put the bags in the room and were off to explore London. The hotel is in a great location for the Angel Tube station so travelling around was very easy. On return to the hotel later that evening, we had a meal in the Bar, which was ok, then retired to our rooms which indeed were quite cool. Again not a problem to us as we only used the rooms for sleeping 1 night. The only problem for us was that our room overlooked the busy main road and was very noisy. If I stayed here again I would ask for a room facing the back of the hotel as these would probably be a bit quieter. When we left one of our sons left a bag behind, we phoned the hotel when we got home and the posted the bag on to us within 3 days!"
99,881,"Jan 2 2008 	Good value would stay there again	Stayed here for 2 nights, and would go back. Room was a good size, clean and nicely laid out. You don't get fancy toiletries in the bathroom, but I wasn't expecting to. The view from our room (at the front) was nice - over the park across the road and as far as the London Eye.The restaurant and bar were quiet in the evenings, but there's lots of choice close-by in Islington High Street (about 5 minutes walk) along with a nice pub next door that serves food.Good transport links are close-by - Angel tube station, and Kings Cross just down the road, as well as lots of buses passing the door.Beakfast was good too - both continental and full English available - buffet style, so lots to eat.Staff were friendly and helpful - both a check-in/out, and for general queries.Overall, not the fanciest place I've stayed, but comfortable and very good value for money."
100,881,"Dec 6 2007 	Good Hotel	The Jurys Inn Islington was a good choice for an Anniversary/theatre weekend in London. The reception area had an expensive feel about it, and the staff were always helpful. We also got free carparking in the hotel car park. A real plus in London. Angel tube was within 100 yards of the hotel and main line rail stations Kings Cross St Pancras and Euston just a short walk. The rooms were up to date clean and not small. The shower/bath was hot and powerful. The only down side was lack of hot food in the evening. We arrived just before 10pm on a Friday to be told the restaurant was closed and the bar were only doing sandwiches. Saturday evening the restaurant was closed due to a function booking. Overall good value for money and would use the hotel again."
101,881,"Nov 15 2007	Lovely hotel	From the very moment I stepped into this hotel I felt welcome. All the staff were without exception lovely and friendly. I'm not an easy customer, and always find faults with the room or the service. This hotel was really good. Exceptionally clean, spacious and comfortable. As a single woman I felt very safe. I had a problem with the first room I looked at as there were two single beds and I wanted a double one. Nothing was too much trouble for the people at the desk. They were quick to show me round another room with a smile (they were fully booked and very busy, but they never made me feel I was a bother). Very sound proof rooms (and I'm a light sleeper!) Breakfast lets the side down a little, (overcooked hash browns and soggy bacon) not great but lots of choice, not disgusting like in some hotels - I guess a bit like service station food. But it does the job. Wonderful water pressure! Great location. Much better than the four star novotel down the road (and the breakfast at novotel really was disgusting!!!). I'm used to luxury hotels. This isn't luxury, but so comfy, I would highly recommend it. So, to sum up: Basic but immaculate rooms, breakfast not great, but five star service with a smile! Lovely! Don't be afraid to book this hotel - if you have any problems, be sure the staff will go out of their way to fix it!"
102,881,"Nov 9 2007 	great hotel	one adult and three kids,needed a good hotel and location. hotel is 5mins from angel tube station. when you walk into reception you know its more than a 3 star! The room was a good size and the shower was great. We had a meal at the bar later and was suprised at the size of portions for the kids as well as the service.Again the breakfast did not disappoint.A good selection for the kids and all very tasty!! Have stayed in quite a few hotels and this one is as good as it gets. Will definately be back. Overall a great hotel and location."
103,881,Oct 30 2007 	Good Overnight Stay	We only stayed for one night and was impressed with the good location (100 metres from Angel Underground) and the cleanliness of the rooms.The hotel facilities are average and the rooms are not too small. The view from the room that we stayed in was terrible (a brick wall - literally).The breakfast was good if you opt for the full english breakfast but very poor if you opt for the continental option.All in all this is a good hotel for an overnight stay!
104,881,Oct 26 2007 	Average hotel but good for london	This hotel is clean and is well located beside the tube. It is fairly new so the rooms are quite modern and airy which is something you struggle to find in london. I will probably be back as its a safe bet.
105,881,"Oct 17 2007 	Great service in difficult circumstances.	When I arrived at Jurys Islington there were fire engines outside and I thought &quot; Oh no, this doesn't look promising&quot;. I was met at the door by a member of staff who informed me that the hotel had suffered a mains water burst and at the moment had neither water or electricity and I was free to cancel my booking without charge. If I decided to wait an hour ( this turned into 2 hours ) I could wait in the bar where complimentary drinks were being served. Being tired and feeling a little under the weather I opted to wait. Some guests made rather good use of the free drinks! The staff were trying their best to keep people informed and happy but one or two guests were more than a little disgruntled. After a couple of hours all seemed to be well and I joined the long queue for check in. The member of staff that had previously greeted me at the door noticed me in line and saying &quot; You've been waiting rather a long time&quot; whisked me to the desk and checked me in herself. This was exemplary service and proved that they really were on the ball. A letter of apology for any inconvenience was pushed under the door an hour later.The rooms at Jurys are of a reasonable size, I had one with a double and a single. Everything worked and the room was spotlessly clean. There was an entertaining gurgle from the sink in the bathroom ( see my video ). They advertise the hotel as Budget Accommodation but I would rate it better than that for general comfort. The buffet dinner in the evening was OK and relatively cheap for the area. Breakfast had a good selection and the staff worked hard to make sure food was replenished and tables were cleared quickly. My room was at the front of the hotel so there was a fair bit of road noise when the window was open but it was OK with the window closed. All the same, I'll ask for a room at the rear when I stay again. Checking out was fast, friendly and efficient. The staff of any hotel can make or break the whole experience. Top marks here to everyone.Overall I'd recommend this Jurys and will be using it again in a couple of weeks."
106,881,"Oct 15 2007 	great hotel	Very good, clean hotel with a good price. I booked it due to the proximity to Sadlers Wells Theatre. Everybody was very happy to serve you, down to the cleaner who was very cheerful. Will definitely stay again if visiting London."
107,881,Oct 14 2007	Very average	Very average hotel. I was able to get a price of 102 instead of 155 which was being advertised everywhere else. Even at the lower price feel it was over priced - but hey this is London. The hotel was very near to the office I was attending a course at which saved a lot of hassle. Room smallish but ok. Smelt a little &quot;tabby&quot; (as in tobacco not cat!) which is suprising given that somking in public places is banned in the UK. Bathroom was functional but shower door was hanging off. Continetal breakfast was reasonable and public areas good and staff polite and helpful.
108,881,"Oct 7 2007 	Comfortable stay at Jury's Islington	I stayed one night at the Jury's Inn Islington in October 2007 while attending a conference at the nearby Business Design Centre. My company travel agent arranged the booking on my behalf.I arrived about 7pm to find my room ready for me, and after a very quick check-in proceeded to the second floor where my room was at the end of the corridor. It was a comfortable room, with a small &quot;sofa&quot; (see photos) as well as the bed, table, TV, tea/coffee and the bathroom area. It doesn't quite compare with Marriott hotels I've stayed in at a similar rate in London, but there was certainly nothing wrong with the room decor, size etc. The bed wasn't quite king size, but that's not a problem for a single occupant.My one complaint about the stay was the noise created by plumbing in surrounding rooms. I woke at least two or three times during the night to hear pipes rattling above or below me, though in fairness I think I was always going to have a fairly restless sleep in any case. It wasn't anywhere near the level that would cause me to complain to the hotel or ask to move room etc.Breakfast was served in the restaurant area, and I found it well presented and very filling. It's self-service, and if you are to have a full English you are given a ticket at the desk to exchange with the person behind the desk at the cooked breakfast part of the buffet. The seating area is spacious and there was certainly no feeling of being rushed to leave, the way you sometimes are in Marriotts and elsewhere.Check-out was uneventful.Overall I'd recommend Jury's Inns, and I'd say I was very satisfied with my experience staying there. They aren't quite 5* deluxe hotels, but they're comfortable and will meet your needs for a quick stay away from home - or a longer stay when you're paying the bill for yourself!"
109,881,"Sep 8 2007 	Brilliant hotel would stay again	I stayed in this hotel with two friends at the beginning of September for one night. My experience of the hotel was totally positive- our train to London arrived at 12.30pm and, as our room was not yet ready for check in, the hotel provided a left luggage facility in a code protected room. After spending the day in London, we arrived back at the hotel at around 6.30pm and checked in with no problems. Our room was quite large considering it had a double and single bed and the bathroom was very clean. We stayed on the second floor and, although there is a bar situated close to the hotel, noise was not really a problem other than the occasional piece of traffic, which is only to be expected in London. We all had an excellent night's sleep and the shower facilities in the bathroom were excellent- very powerful. We ate at the restaurant in the evening which was exemplary, especially when considering the hotel is supposed to be 'budget.' All the waiters were very attentive and helpful, ensuring we had everything we wanted. We ate the 'buffet' dinner, meaning a choice of starters, main course and dessert for around 15 and it was all you can eat. Even though we were allowed to help ourselves, the waiters were very friendly and helped us throughout- very professional. The hotel gave us a telephone number for a taxi company the next morning, which came promptly at 9am to take us to Covent Garden- about 10 with congestion charges but we didn't really have much choice with the underground strikes. The hotel is in prime location, with King's Cross Station only being a few minutes walk down the road. As my visit was based around tickets to be in the audience for a TV show filmed in Elstree, close proximity (about a 5/10 minute walk) to King's Cross Thameslink was also particularly useful. The entire hotel exceeded my expectations, even down to the decor in the reception and lifts- I would never imagine myself to be in budget accommodation. From my experience, I would recommend this hotel to anyone and intend to stay again."
110,881,"Aug 31 2007 	Fabulous Hotel!	We chose Jury's Inn Islington for a weekend of shopping and partying in London recently. From top to bottom the whole experience was fantastic. We were greeted by courteous and efficent staff at check-in and, on hearing that we were in London for a good time, gave us a corner room with lovely views of the city. The food in both the bar and restaurant was of the highest standard and every part of the hotel was spotlessly clean. Our time in the hotel was really made by the attitude of the staff towards us. From Management down to the cleaners, we were greeted with smiles and a 'Good Morning'.We will definitely be recommending this hotel to friends and family.Being experienced travellers, we hace stayed in all types of accomodation all over the world from Los Angeles and Bangkok to Sydney and Beijing. This is how a hotel should be run."
111,881,"Aug 21 2007 	Great room crap location	We stayed here before we started a tour. The room seemed quite luxurious after the hostel accommodation we had been staying in but it was also much more expensive. Food and drinks can be bought downstairs in the restaurant and bar. We had soup and it was delicious. Although the location is close to the city, I really disliked it. The street is packed full of noisy traffic and the pollution was overwhelming. It was also quite a hike with our bags from the nearest train station."
112,881,"Jul 28 2007 	Comfortable if bland hotel in great location	This is 5 minutes by taxi from King's Cross station, but with the huge advantage of being in Islington, rather than the sleazy King's Cross district.The hotel itself is modern, with comfortable rooms - nothing particularly stylish or unusual, but absolutely nothing to complain about either. Ours had a great view over London. There's a street market just round the corner, plus hundreds of bars/restaurants/cafes in Upper Street and around - also just round the corner. When we stayed, this hotel also had smoking rooms available - another huge plus in these puritanical and prohibitive times. Prices are very reasonable for an extremely expensive city - and look out for special deals/seasonal offers etc. Staff were fine. We didn't try the food - you don't really need to with such a wealth of places round about, but the bar stays open late."
113,881,"Jul 5 2007 	Great hotel shame about the bar staff!	I booked a 6 night break at Jurys Inn, Islington through superbreak, which worked out cheaper then going through the hotel itself.It also included breakfast.First impressions of the hotel were very good, the lobby was bright and welcoming. The room was quite a good size, I was surprised that the childrens bed wasn't made up and it was a sofa bed that was hard to figure out.We had to ask for extra towels and although there were 4 of us in the room only 2 mugs were provided.The bath was fairly small, the shower was very difficult to turn on and off and difficult to get to a right temperature.The walls of the room were very thin and on the first night we had the misfortune of having a neighbour that had opera music on very loudly after midnight.The beds were very uncomfortable, especially the kids sofa bed where the matress was only about 3 inches deep and underneath was wooden slats.The breakfast was great, self service and eat as much as you like. Most of the time we had to wait for toast and cutlery, it didn't seemed to be replenished very quickly.The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the Angel tube station or about 10 minutes from Kings Cross. There are lots of good shops nearby, including Sainsburys, Marks and Spencers, Boots, Woolworths etc. There is also a cinema nearby and a market.The main downside that I found were that the bar staff were very infriendly, most of them spoke pidgeon English so it was quite hard to order from them. So if I went again I would stay away from the bar.I would go to the hotel again as it was central for everything."
114,881,"May 26 2007 	Good value for business traveller	stayed at the Jury's Inn as part of a special rate negotiated by the organizors of a conference I was attending at the London Business Design Centre (128 GBP w/ English breakfast / night). The hotel is conveniently located fairly close to Angel tube station and within a short and plaseant walk to the Business Design Centre. Incidentally, Islington is a nice area full of restaurants and shops, and is fairly close to the centre, Soho, etc.The room I had was large and very quiet. English breakfast was OK.All in all a good value for a business traveller."
115,881,"Apr 25 2007 	excellent service	We recently stayed for 4 nights bed and full breakfast which we booked through the superbreak website as we had (after extensive research on trip advisor) decided on this hotel and this was the only site we could get booked on. Myself, husband and daughter aged 9 were in London for the marathon which my husband was running in and as my husband would not be doing the tourist thing we wanted an area where myself and my daughter would feel comfortable and safe. Islington is a thriving and busy area with lots of shops, resturaunts cafes and pubs all within minutes of the hotel and the Angel tube station is 5 mins away although for 2 of the 4 days we were there it was closed due to scheduled repairs but Kings Cross is a 10 min walk at most and has links to quite a lot of other lines. We have stayed at a Jurys Inn before so knew what to expect decor wise etc, everything was clean, fresh and was in good order. We had a requested a non smoking quiet room and this was granted without a problem. On the first day we had to request extra towels as there were 3 of us, these arrived at our room within 10 mins and we had extra towels for the duration of the stay. Breakfast each morning was fresh and warm. We had our evening meal 3 of the nights we were there in the resturaunt. The bar served food also but we decided against this as there did not seem to be a no smoking area as there was in the resutraunt, the service was way beyond that of a 3 star hotel, polite attentive without being over-bearing, nothing was too much trouble. We would not hesitate to book this hotel again and the management are to be commended for their wonderful service......"
116,881,"Mar 20 2007 	good hotel pleasant stay	Just back from a vacation in London.Stayed at Jurys Inn Islington w/gf for 4 nights.Basically, it's what a 3* hotel should be like.Nothing special, decor a bit worn, staff ranging from super-attentive to indifferent, water system a bit ... phlegmatic (hey, it's the UK!).But it was clean, the double room was spacious by London standards, everything worked as advertised,the location is nice (it's close to Angel, a Zone1 Tube station, so it's easy to connect to the city, but Islington seems to be a nice place to look around as well). And we got the &quot;half board&quot; offer via Lastminute - meaning English breakfast in the morning and buffet dinner in the evening - and at 75 pounds a night I think it was a good deal. At that price, I recommend it and would stay there again."
117,881,"Mar 14 2007	Great for families	My family stayed here March 2006. We had been booked in one of the old hotels near Victoria (which was a nightmare). We felt lucky to find a family room available and found the Jury's a welcome change. With the Angel tube station 2 blocks away, it was very convenient. Daniel and his staff were very accomodating."
118,881,"Mar 13 2007	Nothing much wrong nothing much right	Beyond an attractive reception area there is some ugly decor on the way to your room. Mine was perfectly serviceable notwithstanding thin bedding and cheap, small, bath-towels. Everything was clean. In-room internet didn't work with my Mac, but lobby area wifi was fine.Breakfast ticked many of the right boxes visually but everything was cheap and tasteless; white bread for toast, tomatoes tasting only of water, scrambled egg tasting of nothing. However.....the room was cheap for central London as was the breakfast - each around half the price of the Novotel or Hilton equivalent. So what right do I have to expect a Hilton quality room or Novotel quality breakfast?! I'd probably say this was 3.5 stars because of the price/location combination."
119,881,"Feb 27 2007	Good Family Accomodation	My wife and I and two young sons stayed for 2 nights in February. Had booked accomodation on internet based on best value family accomodation and trip advisor reviews. We were expecting an average hotel but were very pleasently surprised by the modern spacious lobby and the friendly reception staff who greeted us. We requested and got a quiet room at the back of the hotel. The room was fine for the money paid, very clean, comfortable bed, although a little bit cramped with the double camp bed for the boys. The bathrooms are probably in need of minor refurbishment, shower was very squeaky and we could hear other guests showers squeaking aswell. Breakfast was okay - a few mushrooms with the brekkie would have been nice, but again staff very friendly. To finish off a very pleasant stay when we were checking out, the lovely lady at reception produced our youngest sons favourite power ranger which we thought he had lost. All in all would definitely recommend."
120,881,"Jan 19 2007 	good value spotty service	I've stayed here before, because of its proximity to the Business Design Centre, but this time stayed here after a conference at another hotel, on a couple of free days, because I think it's a very good value for the money and nicely located. It's very near (1 block) to the Angel Tube which makes getting around town very easy, and the immediate neighborhood has lots of restaurants, bars, shops, etc. if you don't want to go far for dinner after a busy day. The hotel has a nice lobby, and pleasant if not luxurious rooms ( I didn't use the bar). The bath is quite stark, but was large and clean, with a nice big tub for soaking a sore back. I stayed two nights, and unfortunately, my room was missed for cleaning after the first night. I returned about 5:00 pm and the room was just as I had left it. Since I was travelling alone, there wasn't really much disrupted, so I just made the bed and left it at that., but it did seem a big mistake on the part of staff. I booked through hotel.com at a rate of $126/night. I think this place is a great value for that cost in London. Breakfast was not included, but there is coffee in the room, and lots of breakfast options nearby, as well as a Sainsbury's (supermarket) so I stocked up the night before with juice and pastry!"
121,881,"Jan 18 2007 	Good location 	I stayed at the Jury's Inn in Islington, while attending a conference at the Business Design Center. The hotel is in short walking distance from the center, therefore for that reason only, hotel was excellent.My room was above average size - for London standards. Cute decor and nice room amenities. Very comfy bed! The hotel staff needs to brush up on their English, though very nice overall. The hotel itself is situated in a nice area. Islington offers great shopping, bars and cafe's. Starbucks is also around the corner... what more do you want?"
122,881,"Jan 4 2007 	Great budget hotel and great location	My family and I just returned from a week long trip to London, and we had an excellent stay at the Jury's Inn Islington. The location was great (only 1 block from the Angel tube station) and the hotel clean and comfortable. We all thought the continental breakfast was above average -- fresh fruit, yoghurt, croissants, rolls, etc. The staff was also very cordial and helpful. I would definitely stay here again!"
123,881,"Nov 15 2006 	Good value in a great location	I stayed at the Jurys Islington for 1 night in October whilst in London to attend a conference. The hotel booking was last minute &amp; I was pleasantly surprised with what I got for the money paid for a hotel in London! The room was clean &amp; spacious with all the amenities you would expect. Also a lovely view from the bedroom out of the front of the hotel &amp; could spot lots of the London tourist attractions! The breakfast, which was included in the price I paid, was buffet style &amp; basic but sufficient. The best thing about this hotel though has to be its location  in trendy Islington &amp; within walking distance of the tube &amp; lots of bars &amp; restaurants. I would not hesitate to stay here again."
124,881,"Oct 24 2006 	No Frills Whatsoever.	Found easily but directions to car park not good. Room very bare, cheap curtains, small bed, bathroom very basic. First room rejected due to uncleaned toilet (use your imagination!) told to come back to reception to change rooms only to be given room next door (why they couldnt come up and give us the keycard for the new room is beyond me).On a sunday morning, housekeeping knocked on the door 3 times before 10.30am. Checkout is 12 noon. Why do hotels do this? why cant housekeeping wait until reception tell them the guests have checked out?Ok for a night i suppose. 69 is cheap in london i suppose. Wish i'd paid a bit more for something a bit better though."
125,881,"Oct 19 2006 	Central Location	Stayed here just for one night as part of a football package trip. Spotlessly clean, huge reception area, large bedroom with TV, tea/coffee, etc. Standard but nice. Staff were friendly although the English wasn't too good from a couple of them but we got there in the end! The bar downstairs was my favourite - loved the stone decor and nice pints too! Best of all was the breakfast - you could pile as much as you wanted on your plate and this was included in the price. Perfect after a heavy night! Hotel is only 5min walk from Angel tube which is on the Northern Line - links with all other lines to go into central London in about 15 mins. Upper Street around the corner is full of shops, restaurants, bars and a street market. Perfect spot for tourists and overnighters alike."
126,881,Oct 8 2006 	Good value for London	Stayed here for 4 nights In October. Like other Jury's Inns it's low on frills but the bedroom was larger and better kept than most more expensive hotels I have used in London. The staff were helpful and efficient. Broadband access was an extra 10 for 24 hours but the connection was really fast and easy to set up. A nice touch for Irish guests is that the Irish Independent and Belfast Telegraph are available. My only complaint was breakfast - the pallid toast was made in batches and turned luke-warm and soggy quickly. And coffee seemed to be instant - unforgivable in 2006.
127,881,"Oct 3 2006 	A great accidental discovery!	I stayed here for the first time in June 2006 on a business trip, only because the hotel I normally use was full. I haven't looked back.A great location, close to Angel tube station, and with bus routes outside the front door. Islington is a pretty trendy part of town, with lots of nice restaurants and bars.The hotel itself has a nice welcoming foyer, and staff were very attentive. The food in the restaurant was not great, but the food in the bar is very good, and well priced. The bar itself is homely and open until late.Rooms are quite basic, but clean, and bathrooms are great. This is now my hotel of choice when in London, as it combines a great location with good food and drink, lovely staff, and good value for money."
128,881,"Sep 21 2006 	Great hotel	I stayed for one night on business this week. Very handy, just a few minutes walk from Angel tube station, which itself is only one stop from Kings Cross or a ten minute walk. My room was absolutely fine. Everything in the hotel was clean and the staff were all helpful and welcoming. Breakfast was fine and good value.There were lots of little restaurants, shops and pubs close by. Altogether a pleasant, interesting and relaxing experience. Great value at the price."
129,881,"Sep 5 2006	Okay for a short stay	My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights from Sep 1st-Sep 3rd to attend a wedding in London. The overall decor of the hotel is okay, and the rooms and communal areas are very clean.We stayed in a double room, which is the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. As were only there for 2 nights, this wasn't much of a problem. The bathroom was clean and rooms come with a TV, air conditioning, hairdryer and kettle. There are extra pillows/blankets if you require them.We had the continental breakfast on Saturday morning, which was very unimpressive. It consists of bread rolls, fruit ,yoghurt, various cereals, cheese and croissants. I only ate the croissants, but my partner enjoyed his breakfast. We ate out the next morning! There are plenty of cafe's and restaurants serving a reasonably priced full English or vegetarian breakfast nearby.We found the staff very pleasant and helpful, nothing was too much trouble.Islington itself is a wonderful area, plenty of shops, restaraunts, bars etc. I would probably not stay in this hotel again, but the only reason would be because the room was too small. If you're not bothered by this, then go ahead!"
130,881,"Aug 27 2006	Comfortable hotel friendly helpful staff	My family of four stayed at this hotel a total of two nights during our week long European vacation. We were very pleased. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful, answering all of our questions, letting us borrow the front desk phone to call Virgin Airlines when the lobby phone was out of order and arranging all of our &quot;extras&quot; within a very reasonable time. When my husband needed a special adapter for his laptop - &quot;no worries&quot;. When we needed a taxi reserved for us - &quot;no worries&quot;. When we needed the sofa bed pulled out, set up and made - &quot;no worries&quot;. They told me there would be a crib in our room, when it wasn't there, they showed up within 5 minutes with the crib, set it up for us, put sheets down and then brought us everything else we requested (extension cord, extra towels etc) within just a few minutes. We decided to order food from the bar the first night we were there and our family of four ate for only 20 pounds. The next night we ordered dinner and dessert from the restaurant and it was very good and reasonably priced as well. Even the bartender was friendly and helpful. Our 5:30 am wake up call was on time, the air conditioning was easy to use and worked great. The room was very clean. The walls are a little thin, so I stressed a bit when our daughter cried at night, but I wasn't bothered too much by any other guests staying in the rooms near us. The elevators were large enough for all of us and our luggage, which is hard to come by in Europe. The walk from the Anglel tube station wasn't too far but with luggage it was quite a pain, so we opted to pay extra for a taxi the next time we needed to get to Paddington Station. Overall, we were pleased with the Jury's Inn and would recommend it for other families."
131,881,"Aug 14 2006 	Good location good hotel	When I booked the hotel I looked up some information to see if this was worth the money or not. I came to this website, and with the positive reviews here I had a good feeling to go to this hotel.We travelled with Eurostar, and booked the journey with the hotel coming to a  300 for 4 nights each (2 persons). We arrived very early, it was very simple to get to the hotel, it's close to the Angel tube station. I think it's in a 3/4 minute walk in a slow tempo.We had to wait till 2 o' clock to check in, they offered to keep our lugage in the storage room and they gave us 2 smartsave street maps (which has a retail price of 2,95) for free and indicated where we could walk and shop in the surrounding area.Also, with these maps you get a code which can save you 20% in a few restaurants and attractions. (I recommend Bella Italia)You have a small street behind the hotel with a market, a little shopping centre and lots and lots of restaurants. So it was a great location to stay. You even have a gaming arcade across the tube station.Clean and big rooms with airconditioning, friendly people. ANd you also have an ice-machine on every floor, but I didn't know that until the last evening.Too bad there's isn't a little refrigerator in the room.Also, with my reservation, I didn't have all-in. So no breakfast for me, and at the price of  9,50 per person for a full english breakfast I didn't have the heart to spend that much on a breakfast. If you want a cheap and good breakfast, you can go to the street behind the hotel I mentioned earlier and get your breakfast there."
132,881,"Aug 2 2006	Great experience	On a former trip to London, I stayed in a hotel 10 paces from Victoria Station, so I was a little disappointed when I saw the location of the Jurys Islington. But as another reviewer has stated, the hotel is a short walk from the Angel tube station and we found that most convenient. Also, just a short walk from the front doors leads to a great variey of resturants and shops so it turned out to be a great location after all!We arrived a little early (11:00 a.m.) and were told we had an hour's wait for our room. However, 10 minutes later, the front desk rep took the time to find us in the lobby and gave us the good news that our room was ready. In our room, I found that my suitcase had been locked with no keys attached to the handle as they were when I checked the baggage. I called the front desk and within 10 minutes, a very friendly member of the maintenance team was at my door and got the lock off. Great customer service!The room was a good size with a double and single bed. The linens were clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was a little lacking in space for toiletries by the sink, but the tub/shower was large and roomy. Our tour obviously did not purchase the full breakfast, because the lady working the buffet literally barked at me when I took a spoonful of beans, asking for my coupon. Feeling like a fool, I spooned the beans back into the bin. What we ended up with was prepackaged cheese, butter, rolls, cereal, milk, and very watered down juice. Wholly adequate to get the day started.As with every European hotel in which I've stayed, the television is very limited. Granted you are not spending much time in your room, but don't expect to come to your room after a day out and find any familiar programming. Kind of strange in this day of satellites, etc. With the exception of an inebriated guest who wandered the halls in his underwear and finally ended up sleeping in the hall outside our door (the front desk staff did a great job corralling this guy and getting him back to his room), we really had a good stay here. I would definately recommed it to family, friends, and business associates."
133,881,"Jul 4 2006	I'd Stay Here Again	My daughter and I stayed here for the last 3 nights of our Trafalgar tour. The hotel is clean, the food is good, the staff is courteous and helpful, and the rooms are big, clean, and comfortable (compared to the really small rooms in the hotels in Italy). The hotel is near the Angel entrance to the Tube and you can walk to small shops and restaurants. On my next trip to London, I would definitely stay at the Jurys Islington."
134,881,"Jun 21 2006	Clean 	My boyfriend &amp; I stayed at this hotel for one night as we were going to a party nearby. We booked it for just 39 for the room (not each) through a well-known last minute website. At such a budget price I had some reservations, but as we were just going to sleep there after the party, I figured I could tolerate most hovels for a few hours. In actual fact I was very pleasantly surprised- although the rooms are not what I'd describe as luxurious, they were very new and comfortable. The decor was fairly plain and inoffensive, and the rooms were really immaculately clean. It is definitely a grade up from your typical 'travel-motel' with a smart &amp; comfortable lobby where we relaxed for a little while after checking out. The bathroom has a tiny bath, but an excellent shower, the room was air conditioned &amp; had a tv, hairdryer and the usual things you would expect. There was a single bed &amp; a double bed, (both had hard mattresses- which I find the most comfy) so it could be incredibly cheap if there were three of you sharing. The hotel is set back from a fairly busy road, but this wouldn't be a problem if you request a room at the back of the hotel, or just shut the windows and have the air-con on in summer. I have paid a lot more money to stay at other similar hotel chains outside of london, and they proved to be nowhere near as clean or pleasant as this. The deal didn't include breakfast but we went to a great turkish cafe round the back of the hotel to the left of chapel market where a full breakfast with a drink was around 5."
135,881,"Jun 13 2006	Service leaves a lot to be desired	We booked into Jurys Inn on Friday evening and the room was fine - nothing special but clean and more than adequate. Our window looked out on the yard at the back of the hotel but it was quite quiet. On Saturday morning at 7am I heard voices that sounded quite loud - it turned out that other guests were given a key to our room and were in our hallway, they scurried off apologising in broken english and when I rang reception they couldn't find our booking on the system but apologised. As a result of this mix up our room wasn't serviced that day. I rang reception for towels and an hour later there was still no sign so I had to track down housekeeping myself. Also when they cancelled the Japanese guests keys they cancelled ours and as we were in and out at seperate times each time we came in our keys weren't working as they would cancel them all and only provide us with one new key. When we went for breakfast we were informed that there was only one person staying in the room, which reception confirmed. I had to get them to take out our booking confirmation that listed us both and again a short apology was all we received. On the whole the hotel is nice and we love the location, there are some lovely shops and bars around Islington, but because the service was so bad we wouldn't stay there again."
136,881,"May 26 2006	Amongst the best deals in London	Was in London last week for 3 nights. Due to the very last minute nature of the trip and highly limited hotel availability all across central London for this week, I stayed in a different hotel each night. The Jurys Inn Islington was the best of the three and, at 69 GBP, it was less than half the price I paid for the hotel for the first night (which was a pretty decent hotel to begin with). The hotel was immaculate, the rooms were above average in terms of space (for European hotels), clean, and just seemed fresh. The room colors were a little loud, but that's hardly a giant complaint. Decent restaurant onsite, friendly bar too. Dozens of pubs and restaurants all within a 2 block radius. About a 4 minute walk to Angel Tube."
137,881,"Apr 27 2006	Very nice place	Stayed here on bank holiday a couple of weeks ago. Booked the room directly from their website and got the excellent last minute price of 39 (total) - was very pleased with this.Hotel is very close to Angel tube stop (few minutes walk) and has a bus stop literally 30 seconds from the hotel too - so great if you've had a night out and don't fancy trying to flag down a black cab or are prepared to get an &quot;illegal&quot; cab either.Hotel reception and decor was very nice and modern looking - I was expecting somehing &quot;shabby&quot; for what I paid. Room was pleasant also, fairly decent size for the 3 of us. Large double sized bed and large sofa bed too that could easily sleep 2. Shower/bath was nice size too, with what must have been the most powerful shower I have ever experienced! Very nice.The only down side was when I checked in, and I'm sure many others have experienced the same thing. Because I booked the room only a few hours before we arrived, the booking was not showing up for some reason. This was quickly remedied after about 5 minutes or so. Overall, I would definitely stay here again. Be sure to check out their website on the day you intend to stay as you can get very, very good prices."
138,881,Mar 16 2006	excellent in every way	I stayed here in March this year and was very impressed with the price 39 for a triple!! off a late website and the quality of staff and rooms. The staff could not have been more helpful if they had tried. well done
139,881,"Mar 13 2006	somewhere to crash	Four of us stayed here on a saturday night in November when we travelled down to a friend's 30th birthday party. The hotel was really well positioned, walking distance (although up hill!) from Kings Cross, really reasonable (I think we paid abut 35 a head for one nght, room only). Jury's Inn are functional and clean hotels, perfect for somewhere to recover from your hangover that wont break the back. I'd recommend this place if you're on a budget, so many London hotels are disappointing but this one does what it says on the tin."
140,881,"Mar 4 2006	Good value for the money helpful staff	Over Thanksgiving vacation I and my yound daughter travelled to London to visit family. We chose Jury's Inn based on the favorable reviews and were not disapointed.O.k, this is not a luxury hotel and by American standards, the rooms are small and without lavish amenities.However, the profesionalism and attititude of the staff more than made up for this. The front desk saff were extremely helpful and allowed us to check in in the morning after a night flight from the States. This was a huge perk to me as my daughter was exhausted.The location is honestly a little challenging. There are no little shops within easy walking distance, or at least we didn'r find any.This wasn't a problem though as public transportation is frequent and takes you right into central London. As I know London well, staying at this slightly out of the way hotel was fine. But for first time visiters, it might be easier to stay somewhere a little more central."
141,881,"Nov 26 2005	Lovely Hotel Good Location	Stayed for 2 nights last weekend with my mother, sister and brother. Check in was fine. We asked if we could have adjoining rooms as we were a family and this didnt seem to be a problem at all. Rooms were fairly large, In one room we had a double bed &amp; Single bed and other room had double bed and a fold out sofa so plenty of room for us. We paid for continental breakfast when booking however no hassle with upgrading to full english if you want. But be warned, continental breakfast is 7.50 and full english is 9.50 however when upgrading it costs 2.50. I know it only 50p but it was not displayed anywhere, just the prices of the breakfasts themselves. Breakfast was fantastic. Anything you could think of was available and the food was delicious. Location was brilliant, Angel tube station literally a 5 min walk. Very handy. There is no room service in this hotel however we rang down on our second night and ordered food from the bar and they ring back when it is ready to be collected. This food was very tatsy also. Check out was quick, we paid our bill (for breakfast upgrades &amp; food) by cash. Upon checking my creditcard bill online this week I noticed that the hotel still had a hold of Euro113 on my card even though I paid everything up in cash. I had to contact the hotel and ask them to remove this. It was only taken off yesterday, 5 days after leaving the hotel. I had stayed at this hotel previously and thats why I picked this hotel again. I think next time though I might try somewhere else."
142,881,Nov 19 2005	Great Hotel Great location	Got a great bargain on this hotel from Last minute 80 for Friday and Saturday night. Clean and spacious room with spare bed good power shower and the room was cleaned to a high standard during our stay. Helpful staff large restaurant available and a great pub within the hotel which stays open late at weekends. The best thing for me was the location 5 mins from the Angel Tube 10 mins walk to Kings Cross and a great choice of restaurants pubs and shops in Islington. Will definately stay here when in London again.
143,881,"Nov 8 2005 	over expensive for a hard mattress	Far too expensive for a very, very hard mattress (I thought we were sleeping on the bed base) and right above your bed is the fire sensor with 2 red flashing lights (not indicating a flat battery). The furnishings appear to be fairly new, as was the carpet which we thought was probably responsible for the odd smell. However, the windows do open sufficiently to give the room a good airing. Also, it's another hotel with a wide gap between the bottom of the room doors and the floors despite there being a hook outside for newspaper delivery.There are ice machines on most floors and, a big plus, machines selling cold bottles of mineral water.The staff were very helpful and pleasant but some of them had very limited English. Suggest you take something to cover the flashing lights &amp; to block the door gap.Well located for the tube, buses and a short taxi ride from Kings Cross Station."
144,881,"Sep 5 2005	excellent value	We stayed for 2 nights, great hotel,new and modern with nice rooms, good airconditioning.Breakfast was very good . We had a bar meal one night in the hotel pub which was nice and good value again. 5 mins walk to the angel tube station or the no 38 and 19 bus which takes you through to picadilly circus, takes about 15/20 mins.Would stay again and highly recomend this hotel."
145,881,Jun 7 2005	Great value for the money	We stayed at the Jury's Inn Chelsea early June 2005. We booked through their web site and got a great deal. The rooms were clean and nicely furnished. I would rate this a 4 star. The only problem was location. It quite a walk to the subway. Breakfast downstairs was a little confusing. 9 quid for the continental breakfast and 12 for the complete breakfast with eggs. There were buses nearby but of course you can't use them until you already have a ticket. All things considered even if you take a cab from the subway back to the hotel and visa versa it is still a good value.
146,881,"Jun 5 2005	Comfortable and cheap but watch your credit card	We booked this over the internet, had a few moments a check-in with a trainee on the desk, but the room was large and comfortable for my husband, myself and small child. Problems came on checking the credit card bill afterwards - to be found we had been charged twice! (They had booked us into two rooms) - Getting the money back was like pulling teeth but occurred in the end (but with no apology).Would stay there again but would be *very* careful about how many people got to touch our card and check the credit card statement carefully afterwards."
147,881,"Apr 4 2005	Worst hotel experience ever	I use hotels extensively and this is the worst experience I have ever had. I turned up on a Saturday evening with my room prepaid to be told there was no room for me as they had overbooked. I could, they said, go to a substandard hotel in a nasty area.That left me, female, with heavy luggage, on a Saturday night, left alone to find accommodation.I would storngly advise against booking because there is no customer service ethos or feeling of responsibility for customers."
148,881,"Mar 21 2005 	Islington Jury's Inn	Contrary to previous post, I thought one of the best things about this hotel was the neighborhood it was in. Close to the Angel tube stop, the neighborhood had it's own shops and scene going on, as well as a number of restaurants, pubs, and even a movie theater. A 5 min walk got you transport anywhere and everywhere.Rooms were average, no great shakes, but not awful. And the hotel pub stays open til 1:30, which is not common."
149,881,"Mar 18 2005 	Eh....more like a glorified motel	I checked into the jury's inn Islgington for business purposes. The lobby was nice enough (no gourgeous, but basic and nice), but the rooms were like glorified dorm rooms from college - but with prettier color paint on the walls. They were drab and small, very very basic with no ammenities. The bathrooms were the nicest part, but they so drastically didn't match the rest of the room - since the rest of the room was so basic. Was more like a pension than a hotel. The bed was very uncomfortable and small, with sheets that felt like sandpaper. The hotel was loud, with paper thin walls. This was not a hotel that I would pay my own money for, let a lone my company's. I checked out after one night. I later found out that it is not the best part of town. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is expecting more than a 2 star hotel. I would compare this to a 2-3 star hotel in the states - not quite a holiday inn, maybe more like a motel with a fancy bathroom."
150,881,"Mar 16 2005 	Great business trip	Stayed on a recent business trip, staff very attentive, and the attached pub a nice touch as well. Just a pity no ice machines on the landings"

171,881,Nov 16 2007 	De lo mejor de la ciudad
1,886, terrible and it is a disaster to stay there. It is dirty anf filthy. We would not dare tp sit on any chairs in the room. It was so dirty that we would not want to touch anything inside. Management was rude and tried to grab the money for the entire period we intended to stay fearing that we might want to check out once we have seen the conditions of the rooms. Unless you want to have a very unpleasant stay
2,886, who was then asked by reception to share with strangers. When questioned the manager asked if our guest thought he was jesus Christ!!! When I said this was unacceptable I asked the cancellation policy and was told there was no refund
3,886, carpet and furniture were very very dirty
4,886, the photos on the property's website are not what will greet you upon check-in. The apartment we had was threadbare with dirty and stained carpets
5,886, hoping it had improved. we stayed there in 2003 and it was filthy and the host really a cheat.It is such a great location but I am sorry to read it is still the same. i will never
6,886, I sent a reconfirmation note to the property. I recieved nothing in reply. I then reviewed my statements and found they had never billed for the deposit. In a panic
7,886, but when I reached the property
8,886, we saw that the room was actually a very cramped single room that was dirty and had virtually no ventilation (window looking out on a light shaft). In addition
1,890,"You get what you pay for	We wanted a cheap, clean and well located London hotel for one night and that's what we got. We had no expectations about frills (there are none). I would recommend it if the hotel and its services are not the focus of your time. Like other reviews the key card didn't work initially."
2,890,"Just one or two problems!	I stayed here with my 3 children and my mum for 5 nights, the hotel reception is how it states on their website, friendly very helpful and 24/7. Tea/coffe making facilities are avalable 24/7, and the staff do not mind if you get up at 0300 to grab a hot chocolate either, Although be careful with the cardboard takeaway cups when using the lift, we was on the second floor!Problems-1- window lock broken! Although reported twice, not fixed at all during our stay which meant i couldn't take my eyes of my children (all aged under 8y.o) for a minute.2- Had to use the clean towels to dry water up from the floor after shower, no clean ones given3- Bunk beds!!!- We booked a family room, Family room for 3 children under 8 years old, mum and myself = Set of bunkbeds, 1 double and 1 camp bed at side of double, NOT a double bed and 3 single beds, or 2 double beds + 1 single bed has we was told would be at time of booking. 4- The TV was hung on the same wall has the bunkbeds which meant that whoever was in the bed under the window had no chance of watching anything has the end of bunkbed stopped the viewing. Also whoever was on top bunk kept catching their leg, knee, elbow, head on tv bracket or the tv on their way up and down the bunk ladder.5) Breakfast is cereal, in a pot, similar to twin muller yogurt pot, (cornflakes one side, milk the other) and fresh juice in glass bottle, to be eaten in you're room at a charge of 5.95 per person!6- Doors banged when closed, not good at 0300 Good points?- These have to be the comfiest beds i have slept in, like sleeping on a cloud!..The hotel staff was excellent with the children. Rooms was moderate clean, although we had no room to move let alone actually see much of the floor.The hotel is nowhere near Kensington palace but is within about 15min walk from the tube station, which is easy to find once you found it once. There is loads of shops about 15-20mins walk from the hotel, A big play park for the children with a lovely welcoming atmosphere from the local parents and children. The hotel doesn't mind if you take food back with you to you're room, i recommend you try the Chicken Inn Takeaway, great prices and best roasted chicken i ever tasted!To sum this hotel up= Great for cheap night stop, Friendly, happy, chatty staff, child friendly, situated just nicely from everything you need, great for a short night stay, although the hotel needs to re-think it's family room and placement of tv's in relevance to all beds.DONT walk back to hotel after around 2100, people will stop you in the street asking for money."
3,890,"Nov 23 2009 	I would not recommend this ""Hotel"" to anyone	Booked a twin room. On arrival found that twin means bunk beds. The so called room was not much wider than a corridor and about as long as a prison cell. Accessing the top bunk would have been lethal so therefore spent a very uncomfortable night sleeping on the floor. No where in their literature of pictures does it mention bunk beds but does show a narrow angle shot of twin beds which I am lead to believe are in a family room. The receptionist was working her first day and been left on her own. I was assured that someone would get back to me re the room, no one did. I have demanded a refund but looking at other comments I don't hold out much hope. Watch this space and please consider very carefully whether you really want to stay here. I have only given a one in the review because the site will not let me give zero."
4,890,"Nov 16 2009 	It's a no-no from me	Thought it was a hotel, but was little more than a hostel, a hostile hostel at that. Luckily it was for just one night as a quick getaway for a west end show otherwise I would have cancelled and moved elsewhere. Room is tiny (I'm a UK size 14 and had trouble turning around in the bathroom), the door was wedged open on arrival, the staff knew about this but made us go to the room to allow us to return to tell them the key did not work, no alternative rooms were available, and it was clear they were not going to help. We had to be allowed into our room by a member of staff...each time. There were no curtains only a see through blind that was broken, on one hand I was glad it was winter so that it was dark at night, but the street could see you with the light on and there was no room to change in the bathroom.Nightclub on corner of street is VERY noisy at 3am. Other than that, good value but you get what you pay for."
5,890,"Nov 10 2009 	Having trouble with your booking you see we have 2 Jennifer's tonight	I've never had a hotel stay that so exactly matched the Trip Advisor reviews!We checked in at 2300 after a show, and they had trouble finding out pre-paid lastminute.com booking. The excuse: &quot;We have 2 Jennifer's staying here tonight, and we don't know which room has been given to the other Jennifer who checked in earlier.&quot; The clerk had to go find a room that was unoccupied to give us, and they had us register using the other Jennifer's card. I crossed out every piece of info that didn't match mine, just to be safe, and didn't sign the part saying I'd be liable for charges.When we got to our room, there were no towels, but my partner went back down to the desk, and quickly got some. The key never did work, we just knocked and let each other in. The noise from outside wasn't bad, even after bars closed, but any voice in the hallway seemed to be amplified and played louder right in our room. The fire alarm went off once, and we ignored it.However.......the room was sufficiently clean for me, with no smells or bed bugs. The ensuite was also clean, and not as small as others I've stayed in. The shower was hot with good water pressure. As a place to stay between 2300 and 0900 it fit the bill."
6,890,"Nov 7 2009 	Reconsider staying here	Rooms the size of prison cells, breakfast containing only Corn Flakes and milk (?!), the smell, keys not working, unsafe location during nighttime, no change of towels or sheets ( we stayed there for three nights and had to share the same two towels the entire time) and not so nice employees.I would really reconsider staying here..Oh and bye the way. I forgot my brand new glasses there and have repeatedly asked them to send them to me (i live in sweden) but they never answer emails unless its regarding booking."
7,890,"Oct 28 2009 	Wouldn't recommend to anyone	We arrived at the hotel at 8pm after attending an all day music festival to be told that our reservation had been cancelled because our payment had not gone through. We had reserved the room on our credit card which unfortunately got stolen during the trip so we had to cancel the card. We had thought that the room was prepaid but when we got there the staff said that they had tried to process the payment that morning and given the card had been blocked, they cancelled our reservation. No-one at the hotel tried to call us to see whether we had another credit card or could make alternative payment arrangements, they just cancelled it without notification, The guy at the desk told us he had emailed us to let us know the room had been cancelled (he hadn't, and even if he had, who checks their email every day when they travel?) and there were no rooms left at the hotel. He half-heartedly tried to find us another room that night in the area but I ended up finding a room myself at a Travelodge we had stayed at on our last visit to London. We only booked this hotel because it wasn't too far from Knightsbridge where the festival was held, but I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. Two rooms of people came down to complain about their rooms while we waited for the guy at the desk to find us another hotel room, and there are signs in the street outside warning people about the danger of getting burgled - we didn't see signs like this anywhere else in London. I'm actually glad we didn't stay there, but it was very stressful trying to find at hotel at 8.30 that night.The irony is that they have a digital photo frame at the desk encouraging people to log on to tripadvisor and rate their hotel - it doesn't rate in my opinion."
8,890,"Oct 16 2009 	Absolutely Disgusting	We stayed here overnight on a business trip and would not in a million years recommend it.First there were problems booking in as we did not have the paperwork but did have the credit card.Next we were given a key for a family room when we booked two triples. We were then given the family room which by all accounts was ok and a triple which was not.As soon as we walked in the smell of mould hit us and on opening the portaloo, sorry bathroom, door the smell of urine which did not go away when flushing but got worse.We went back to complain and the receptionists could not even get into our room and once he did he sprayed something to cover the smell.We decided to stay in there and put the shower on to warm up, on opening the door the fire alarm went off.The receptionists came to our room and we explained what had happened and he locked our door whilst it was open and said that we could not close it until we went out, so we had to get changed with our door not completely closed.Later that night on returning from having a meal the smell was back.We have since returned home with small insect bites and have contacted the hotel but with no response.This is the worst stay I have ever had - budget should not mean dirty."
9,890,"Oct 9 2009 	Definitely a ""budget"" hotel.	We stayed on two separate occasions. The first time the bedroom was impossibly small for a double bed but the ensuite bathroom was good. On the second visit the room was a larger one but the ensuite bathroom was miniscule! On both occasions we found the facilities clean and adequate, the beds comfortable and the noise levels reasonably low. There has been an on-going problem with the swipe keys for the door locks which we were told was under review. The hotel is conveniently situated to the West Kensington tube and several convenience stores, as well as a laundrette."
10,890,Oct 5 2009 	B	This is NOT a hotel it is a B&amp;B so I will not rate it as a hotel. Booked a double room and was given a room you couldn't swing a mouse in never mind a cat. The smell of raw sewage from the bathroom was stomach turning and if you could stick it long enough to have a shower the fire alarm would go off in the 'so called' bedroom because of the steam. The side of the building has a large sign down the side that says BED &amp; BREAKFAST but they're cute enough not to show that side in photo. The room key never worked so you had to get the reception to keep opening it.WON;T BE BACK!!
11,890,"Sep 30 2009 	Double room booked and paid for - got a cupboard with bunkbeds	This trip was booked for me and my girlfriend. I was about to go away to Fiji on an expedition for 3 months as a volunteer research assistant - I had to attend a briefing in London. We arrived at hotel to be told there were no doubles available and they took us to the room which was basically a cupboard with bunkbeds. The area was full of house parties and kids hanging around, we did not feel safe. I moved to another hotel. On trying to get our money back I was informed that the Night Desk Operator showed us a double room and we said it was not suitable - THIS IS A TOTAL LIE. I believe they let our room go to someone else I WOULD NEVER EVER RETURN OR RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE. If my elderly grandparents booked this hotel - how could a 74 and 83 year old get into bunkbeds. Disgusting. To date I have not received an apology or refund so in total one nights stay in London - without breakfast cost me over 200 as I had to move hotels. BEWARE do not stay here."
12,890,"Sep 23 2009 	Good budget hotel if you don't mind small rooms	Clean hotel in ok area, close to tube stations. Service at reception slow (receptionist was new though I think...) and key cards had a habit of not working (not good when no-one is at reception!). Room small but clean, and perfectly ok for a nights sleep."
13,890,"Sep 21 2009 	There are better deals out there	This is the fourth time I have travelled to London, and all four times I stayed in a different hotel. I was very disappointed with this particular hotel. One of the main reasons I chose this hotel was the fact it had WiFI but the Wifi connection was horrendous. I had to purchase a pay-to-go broadband modem in the end from 02. Even after I had raised the matter up to the reception, there was no improvement (to be fair, i guess all she could do then was just to reboot it).We stayed in a room for 5 then a room for 3 when 2 of our party left earlier. The room for five was cramped but that was expected. What was not expected was a window that could not be closed (and the hotel is fairly near a very busy road), a sink so tiny that brushing our teeth was a challenge (plus it clogs) and a bath tub with shower facilities but no shower curtain? I seriously think there is not much point in advertising about their 'branded' shower gel when a simple thing like a shower curtain was not provided for. The room for three was better, esp the shower faciliity.Free hot choc and coffee is nice, but I could have gotten free breakfast and a room for four in Oxford hotel for the same price i was paying for a room for three. Plus the fact that the hotel was in zone two and that added quite a bit more to our travelling expenses. Worse of all was the staff. During my stay, I had come into contact with four different receptionists. Only one was friendly and efficient. All were foreign (and I am not being discriminatory as I am from the same part of the world as them), and do not take the time to listen to their guests even though their command of English was questionable. They initially refused to check my party in as I had made the booking under my name and I arrived later than the rest (even though I was told by the hotel during reservation that it would not be a problem). A few other niggling problems as well but too lengthy to detail here.The impression I got from this hotel was that the owner was not very invested in its management and left it to part-time staffers (mainly students). I would not recomment it to anyone because there are definitely hotels of equal, if not better value, in zone 1, considering their WiFi is really non-existent. Restaurant choices is practically non-existent around the hotel, which again made it inconvenient."
14,890,"Sep 14 2009	new clean but staff not helpful	We had a room for 5 adults and location wise it is OK about 5-10 minutes walk from the tube station. There is no breakfast included but there is a free coffee machine downstairs but the guests. The rooms are clean and new but our sink was partially clogged and the bath area had no shower curtain which made it a little hard as by the time 5 adults bath, the whole floor was wet. The staff were not very helpful and definitely not friendly. Most of the questions asked they had no idea and we had to borrow their luggage room for half a day which they let but upon arrival to collect them, they left us waiting at the luggage room until we had to go down and ask them again to come up (they already knew we were waiting)The website says free wifi connection, it is true, but the connection is weak and I had alot of trouble getting connected. And when I do, it bumps me off saying there is another user using the IP address. So apart from the cleanliness and location, I dont really feel this was very worth it. Dont bother about the free coffee, it wasnt that great to compel us to stay here again. I'm still sore about the internet..."
15,890,"Jul 5 2009 	hotel	I stayed in W.K. for a week. My room was very small, but incredibly CLEAN!!!!! it's a good place if you need only a bed to sleep in and then go out in the morning for the whole day :) Staff is really nce and helpful. They called a cab for me in the middle of the night and helped with the luggage. Bathroom is tiny but still, it has a wc, sink and shower - what else is needed? ;)"
16,890,"Jun 19 2009 	Location 	Hotel/guest house was near to underground station, clean, recently refurbished. Staff very helpful &amp; friendly. Rooms small but adequate. Hotel is ideal if you are just looking for a clean bed for the night. Area initially intimidating, but incurred no problems walking around with a young child, though very noisy on Saturday night but then it is London. Overall I paid for what I got &amp; was very pleased with the Kensington West."
17,890,"Jun 17 2009 	Cheap Clean and Cheerful	I needed a place to stay for one night in London. Not looking for anything luxurious, finding somewhere cheap was my main goal, hence I stumbled upon the Kensington West (under the confusing guise of the &quot;Olympia Rooms&quot; - but is the same place!) on laterooms.Trust me - for 45GBP (double room) you will not find anywhere as clean, safe or friendly as this in a decent part of London. The receptionists were friendly and helpful, and there is room to store luggage. There are free drinks in reception and free wi-fi. The rooms, albeit small, are meticulously clean and quite modern. There are also toiletries in the bathroom and a small LCD TV on a pivot above the bed.This isn't a luxurious hotel, but it is very functional, and the price reflects that. Breakfast is not included, but there are a few cafes nearby or you can buy cereals at reception. The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from West Kensington tube station (hence only a short hop into zone 1) and is in a quiet, non-threatening residential street.Many cheap London hotels are grotty, dirty and unfriendly - but this is not one of them. I shall certainly look no further when needing a no-frills overnight London stay."
18,890,"May 30 2009 	Great for those on a budget; otherwise you can do better.	Like many others, I found this hotel after scouring the web for a non-sketchy budget hotel in London and booked a double room and a quad room for my family for 6 nights. Though it worked out well for us, if you have high standards and are not willing to be flexible or make compromises, this is not the hotel for you. My impression was that it has been recently refurbished (new paint, new fixtures in the bathroom, overly elaborate motion sensored lights in the hallway), but that it was not being kept up very well - for example, our shower head sprayed water all over the bathroom, and for most of the trip the bathroom smelled of sewage. If you can shrug that sort of thing off, then this hotel is worth the price. The rooms themselves are small and tidy - just enough room for you and your bags. No fridge but there are rather new TVs, and free wireless Internet. Neighbourhood was generally pretty low-key. Only a handful of restaurants nearby, but head one tube stop over to Earl's Court and you'll find a variety of places to eat, including some of the least expensive menus I've seen in London. As a student on a tight budget, I would come back and stay here. The big rooms would be a nice upgrade for backpackers who are sick of hostels, but unless you are trying to save money, splurge a bit for somewhere a little better located and better maintained."
19,890,"May 27 2009 	Pretty good for the price.	We stayed here for 4 days during a trip across Europe. It took forever to find a suitable place to stay in London as most places are either extremely expensive, or cheap with horrible trip advisor reviews.In this case, the price is right, the location is fine (a 5 minute walk to the West Kensington Tube station which is no big deal), and most importantly the room was clean. I'd absolutely recommend this place for the budget traveller. We had a problem with the TV, and the attendant came to check it out right away. We had fresh towels each day, and the beds were fine (although of course not the most comfortable things in the world)"
20,890,"May 9 2009 	Not much Fun	Walking distaance to Kensington West tube station but the neighborhood made us uncomfortable. Seven doors to access our room, three required the key card. Hot beverage provided in the lobby. Not much variety available for meals nearby so eat before you come or bring your own food. Had to ask for bath towels. No hand towels, washcloths or bath mat provided. Just one sheet and a comforter on the bed which was lumpy. Locked out of our room twice in three days. Reservation was lost. Awakened by fire alarm in middle of the night apparently a false alarm."
21,890,"May 2 2009 	What you see is what you get	This was our first trip to London, so finding a hotel was quite a feat. The thing that worried us most was cleanliness (not what London hotels are famous for). After searching through zillions of sites we decided on the West Kensington. I must say that the various reviews were quite accurate. We had a quad which was really microscopic (like the bathroom) however the hotel was SUPER clean, close to the tube station and the area was quaint and pleasant. As the weather was quite cool in the evenings we kept the windows closed so all noises were shut out. Staff was very helpful and friendly, they booked us a cab (at three in the morning), gave us a wake up call and even helped us by re-printing our plane tickets (which we had lost!!!) free of charge. Though I can't really compare it to other hotels as far as prices go (this was our first visit ever) I definitely reccomend it!"
22,890,"Apr 29 2009 	simple clean and cheap	After searching through dozens of hotels on tripadvisor we settled on this hotel. It was no more or no less of what you could ask of a budget hotel in London. The hotel room and bathroom were incredibly clean +++, which is my first priority. The hotel has a lift, a complimentary 24 hour coffee/tea machine in the foyer, a luggage room to leave your belongings if you have a later flight/train the day of check out and pleasant staff. The location was ideal to walk (with or without luggage) to either Kensington Olympia or West Kensington Tube stations. The neighbourhood felt safe enough (for London) and quiet (excepting the occasional drunken singers walking home). Sure our room was simply that - a room with a double bed, small desk and ensuite but for the price and cleanliness who would argue?"
23,890,"Apr 12 2009 	A rare find for the budget conscious traveler!	After staying in London budget hotels at least a dozen times, I've come to realize a good value &amp; great hotel when I find one. Most London hotels are small, smelly &amp; just a complete rip-off. But, this hotel is a rare find.1.) VERY clean. You couldn't have asked for a cleaner hotel.2.) Great for the budget conscious traveler. It's a perfect find in a very expensive city.3.) Free coffee/hot chocolate/tea/mocha in the reception area... available all day &amp; night.4.) Within a 5 minute walk from West Kensington station, with easy/quick access to the sights.5.) Elevator available for those who need it.6.) Nice, new refurbished rooms &amp; bathrooms (no shower curtain, but that wasn't a problem.)7.) We had a room to accommodate 4 people - and was plenty of room. They actually had an extra bed to fit 5!8.) The front desk / reception workers were very nice &amp; helpful.9.) Quiet rooms &amp; quiet neighborhood in general. No traffic noise.Book this place... it truly is a rare find for those on a budget!"
24,890,"Mar 31 2009 	Long weekend in London town	I've book this hotel because was one of the few hotels with family rooms. The accomodation was confortable for 5 dults, with 4 sigle and a double bed. Small bathroom with a tiny sink, bath tube and wc. For was who want to use the hotel just for sleeping I think that is enough. Cleaning and friendly staff. The hotel has an elevator which I think is essential especially if the room is at the higher floors. I recommend this hotel to couples and groups of young people who want to stay in the center and have a low budget. The hot drinks like coffe, chocolate, tea are free and available 24 hours in the reception, it's possible to have the breakfast pack that inlcludes yogurt, chocolate and other things for just 3.95 gbp.The only inconvenience we had and that I consider serious was no hot water for 2 days (we have passed in the hotel only free nights), The staff was not able to resolve the problem, they apologize and ask to us to patient. At the end we left the hotel and the hot water not yet available. I think that in a city as London it's possible to solve any kind of problem any day of the year even on Saturday and Sunday."
25,890,Mar 21 2009 	On the Fence - But Cheap	Just returned from staying 4 nights. Got a quad which was 54# per night. Was a double bed and two twin beds that were hung from the wall and lowered when needed (like bunk beds). The beds were OK. The room was very clean and I thought it was quiet (my wife would disagree with me as she says there was some noise). Observations (1) Adequate heat if needed but no AC. May be a problem in the summer (2) Area is not real nice but we did not feel unsafe. There was always people walking about. Not one of the nicer areas though as all was old and trash was everywhere (3) bathroom was too small. I am normal size but if you are a plus size person then this hotel is not for you. I would have to think twice about staying here again simply due to the bathroom size. It was smaller then those on cruise ships. It was adequate but very very small. (4) a short walk to the west kinsington tube and thus location is not bad. (5) no breakfest but there is a place on the walk to the tube that sells a nice english breakfest for 4 pounds. (6) Hot Choc. machine (Coffee too) was very good. (7) Wi Fi hotspot is not very good as you can connect about 20% of the time. In summary if you can fit in the bathroom and all you want is a clean place to sleep this is a good cheap hotel. Recommended but would still look at my options for the next trip.
26,890,"Jan 31 2009 	Spotless	I would like to say few things about this hotel. My sister stayed at this hotel and I made the reservation for her. I was concerned about a couple of bad reviews I saw on this site. Well the hotel is absolutely an excellent value for a very little money, and the bad things that has been said on this hotel are simply not true. I belive also the bad pictures I saw was created at art. My sister came to visit me and this was the second time she was travelling on her own, so I was concerned about the cleaness and the safety of the accompdation. Here my surprise the room was SPOTLESS, very clean from the catpet to the bed. The toilet was immaculate. I've travelled myself a lot and I've never found something like that with that money. The LOCATION was my second priority for my sister and I have to say was excellent. Very quite neibourhood and first of all SAFE. My sister was alone and she felt perfectelely safe. Very close to the tube station ( district line ) and close to hammersmith road, where the bus number 9 goes to the town.The reception was very kind with me and let me see the room for my sister the day before.One thing the rooms are small but was perfect place to sleep safe clean and quite. Is a bed and breakfast! For the little money my sister paid would be hard to find a place as clean as this. Honestly!!!PS: I would like to suggest to the person who left the bad review about this hotel and was so disappointed to spend a little more money (than 30  per night) and go straight to Her Majesty the Queen of England and ask if she could rent out a room in Backingam Palace."
27,890,"Jan 11 2009 	Excellent low cost hotel in a great location	I booked this hotel after searching for a cheap hotel to stay in after a night out in London. I was intending to book a 'secret' room in a 4* hotel but after reading the reviews on this hotel I decided to book here. I was not disapointed. We stayed in the hotels smallest room with bunk beds and a pod en suite bathroom. The room was clean and larger than I was expecting but still very small. The bunk beds which folded down from the wall were very comfortable making this a better option than a hostel room at the same price.The hotel staff were very friendly and the electronic entry system worked really well. I would book with the hotel direct as this saves you money. There are a few restaurants, a bank and tube station near by. When looking at a map this hotel looks a little difficult to find but is actually really easy.For a night out in London this hotel cannot be beaten"
28,890,"Dec 22 2008 	Great value!	Myself and 4 friends had two rooms in this hotel. Location was great, 10 minutes walk from West Kensington subway. Was quiet at night and the reception staff were friendly. Rooms themselves were small, so were the bathrooms. BUT- the shower worked, so did the toilet, tv and bed (which is quite large). Yeah there was no breakfast, but if you're paying 36 a night and want free breakfast then you're probably a cheapskate.The hotel was everything it advertises... I can't understand the negative feedback some people leave. I'd imagine they're probably the same people who complain about the service on RyanAir :P11/10."
29,890,"Nov 30 2008 	Just what I needed!	I needed to stay somewhere in Central London for one night and still hadn't booked it the night before I was heading down south! Was looking on lastminute.com which showed me cheap rooms, and 38 didn't seem too bad for such a short-notice deal, especially since I had read reviews for other hotels that were a few pounds cheaper that seemed terrible! I looked directly on the Kensington West hotel site and for some reason, a double room with en-suite cost the same as a single room (38), and reviews were good, so I booked up for the following evening. I arrived at midday and was able to leave my case in a secure luggage room until i checked in later in the evening, when I returned to the hotel. The staff were very helpful and directed me to my room. I was surprised at how clean the room was, it looked very contemporary and had everything I needed for the night. I had no problems with noise at night and the bathroom facilities were clean and above average. The next day, once I had checked out, I was still able to leave my case in the luggage room until I was ready to collect it on my way back to the train station that evening. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Kensington West hotel and would definitely recommend it. Next time I'm in London, I will certainly use this hotel, its location was perfect and the value for money was excellent!"
30,890,Oct 31 2008 	Great Value	We were looking for a hotel to stay in whilst attending open day at university with my daughter this hotel was just what we needed cheap cheeerful great location access to tube cafes' and a few local shops rooms were clean and staff helpful would defo stay again
31,890,"Oct 1 2008 	Not what I expected	After reading several reviews from this hotel I was expecting a lot more! The room was overprized and I just feel their hands slipped into my pocket. Not even free breakfast for the price!Negatives: The toilet's so small you can't do anything there, you can't even wash your face in the sink. But hey, at least it has one! The tap wasn't working so I only had (very) hot water and there was no towel hanger. You can hear everything on the top floor of the room. There are no blinds in room's window so it is so bright at night as by day and everyone can look inside. No top sheets on the bed - just a blanket! The room floor was never cleaned while we were there.Positives: very nice and helpful employees; cleanness; very charming; excellent location.I honestly liked the hotel. Really. If it just had the correct price..."
32,890,"Sep 19 2008 	At last!!	After 5 years of searching for a reasonably priced, clean and comfortable room in the Kensington area I have found it!!I work just around the corner three days a week and stay in London on average two nughts each week.The hotel (more of a bed and breakfast really) is clean, modern and the staff very welcoming. Why is it that most other 2/3 star hotels in Kensington and Earls Court just don't get it!! What we want is CLEAN, modern and staff that can communicate in English and are empowered to sort out problems.Not that I had any problems.Minor gripes - TV reception (in my room) was hopeless and the towels are perhaps a bit frugal.I note that some of the reviews seem to have concern about the area. Don't - I have never had any sort of problem in 5 years and I would feel much happier walking around here late at night than the West End. Its not Kensington High Street but there again you would pay through the nose for that part of the world.A couple of tips - the best pub/gastro pub in London the Cumberland Arms is a 5 minute walk away. A further 2 minutes will take you to Hammersmith Road where you can find Mirabelles the best Italian cafe/take away in London - try the Number 1 salad.I don't know why I am being so positive I want to be able to book in here on a regualr basis and if it gets too popular..................."
33,890,"Sep 10 2008 	Very affordable and great place and great staff	Hello folks,We had booked 2 rooms in the hotel through Gulliver's Travell Association..It was a great experience in the hotel the staff are pretty nice to the guests and mainly the guy by name Daniel Neagoe was really helpful.We stayed at rooms 3 and 9 for 21 days from 17th august till 6th september 2008."
34,890,"Jul 22 2008 	A Truly Great Way to Visit London	Have stayed in London several times before and through a friend had heard about these Castletown Lettings apartments www.castletownhouse.co.uk available in West Kensington and contacted them directly for booking. Found the total experience excellent in every regard. Pricing was well below a good hotel with many more amenities than the hotel had offered. The rooms were fully equipped (big screen flat panel television, wireless internet, full kitchen with oven microwave, large spacious bedrooms, and living room as well). Couldn't have asked for a better location. West Kensington I think is the &quot;in&quot; neighborhhod in London, it's clean elegant, safe and convenient. We were ~5 minutes from a tube stop, and five minites from some great dining spots. Really enjoyed going out to a Thai restaraunt one night for dinner and being able to store our leftovers in our own fridge, and the two minute stroll to a great cafe for morning coffee. Couldn't recommend them more highly. Clean, roomy, ideal location, and most importantly felt at home!!"
35,890,"Mar 25 2008 	Clean comfortable base for seeing London	We booked Kensington West through the Eurostar website, along with our train tickets from Brussels to London. We chose it for the price, and because we could get a quad room on short notice (we booked 3 days before we arrived).For a budget hotel, this is a good option. It's not necessarily near any places on the to-do list, but it is only a 5 minute walk to the West Kensington Tube station, with easy access to everywhere via Tube. The neighborhood seemed to be very working class, and the hotel was a few blocks from the nearest busy street. We did not feel uneasy about the location, but a woman on her own might not feel the same way. As with every hotel where we've stayed in London, there was conversation noise from outside until the early hours of the night.The hotel was clean and recently refurbished. The kids loved the fold-up bunk beds, which were ready made with clean linens. As with all London hotel rooms, this was small, but it was easier to move around in than our last quad room in London, and more smartly laid out. The minimalist wardrobe had no doors, so it was easy to stow our stuff without having to rearrange the room. The room is equipped with a good, flat screen tv for your BBC viewing pleasure, though it's really only visible from the double bed.On check-in, our room for 4 only contained 1 towel, but the front desk clerk took care of that reasonably quickly. They don't have keys to the linen closet after the cleaning staff leaves, so check that you have what you need as soon as you check in. The light fixtures were cracked from being screwed too tightly, and the bathroom shelf was missing, but the room was otherwise in good repair. I didn't see any air conditioning, but we don't visit London in the summer...There are free hot drinks in the lobby, but don't expect much from the add-on breakfast. It appeared to be yogurt and a granola bar. It was not really overpriced, just not quite what we wanted for breakfast. We simply purchased breakfast food from the grocery store and had that before heading out for the day. There weren't many places to eat nearby, but it was easy to find grub near the places we were visiting, so that did not bother us.Overall, we were happy with this hotel. For a place to sleep between forays into the city, it was very adequate, and we would consider it again."
36,890,"Feb 28 2008 	Stay away from this place!! Not sure what the good reviews are...	I have read reviews from here and trip advisor. All had medium things to say. First this is not a hotel but a Bread and Breakfast. I attempted to check in at 1:30 and was told that checkin was at 2:30. There was noone in the hotel at all, they must have had rooms. Second, nothing worked at front desk, credit card mach., phone, internet, wireless etc. Third I was checked into a closet, seriously I have stayed in London many times before, this was a walk in closet; with a suitcase you had to step on the bed to get to bathroom. The door would not open fully from the bathroom as the bed is 6 inches away.I requested another room, after some serious grumbling I was sent to antoher room. Larger size, bathroom was ridiculous small. The toilet was in the shower, YES it is!!! The shower curtain had so much mold it was HARD!! YES!! The mattress is basically a box spring, all night metal springs poking you.I booked 3 nights and left after one. Expedia could not dial international to attempt to refund the difference. I have stopped payment. STAY AWAY!!!"
37,890,"Dec 31 2007 	it's ok	the location is good. close to the tube station, and a quiet and not at all dangerous area. the room was very small, but at least it was very clean. the staff helpful. we stayed only for 2 nights. we booked this hotel from an internet hotel website, so we didn't pay the normal hotel rates. i advise you to do the same thing, since the normal price is too much for this hotel. no problems with noise."
38,890,"Oct 26 2007 	Don't do it.	This was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, the customer service was horrible and the hotel double charged our credit card and refused to give us back our money. I would not recommend to stay here. The beds were dirty, our room smelled like a toilet and there was no heat, along with a broken lift. Please think twice about staying at this hotel. It's not worth the money or aggrivation."
39,890,"Oct 17 2007 	Small but at a great price	Any clean, bright room with newly painted walls, modern bathroom and a bed with clean linen for only 50Pounds (for a Queen bed) to be had in London wins high marks from me. 5-7min walk to West Kensington Tube took us through a quiet neighborhood that some may mistake for shady, but I would describe as just a little shabby, as one would expect of London, but no unsavory characters in sight. Multiple doors did not bother us as this is the standard in London due to fire safety regulations. But from previous reviews and my own experience, it seems like the lift is permanently out of order! This may be a problem if you are stayingon the higher floors (my second floor room was accessible) and have to lug your suitcase up the narrow staircase. So guests may wish to request a room on the lower floors.The room is very very small! Once we opened our samsonite on the floor there was hardly space to walk around. We had to shimmy past each other sideways and if I sat on the edge of the bed, my knees almost touched the facing wall.... There was no wardrobe to speak of,only a metal bar in an open wooden compartment 1.5ft across, but withhangers for use. The bathroom was clean and modern with black and white tiles. But once again, the sink was tiny to properly brush my teeth over. No towels or toiletries were provided, which was a bit ofa disappointment. However, the lovely high ceilings, easy-on-the-eye pastel green wallsand sheets, new carpeting really made this a good deal for the night.No problem with the wifi connection and people at the front desk werehelpful and printed out the e-tickets we needed for our onward journey. This is not a luxury hotel, but new, good and clean and that's all we needed to rest our heads at night."
40,890,"Oct 9 2007 	Had a great experience. Would definitely go back!	OverallWe stayed at this hotel for a week in September and overall had a great experience. The rooms were clean and it did seem as if they were newly refurbished which was nice. The rooms are rather small, but this is London and that's what you get. The room was mostly taken up by a bed and the dresser/desk, but the two of us were able to get around the room without any problems. There was a flat screen TV on a bracket that was convenient to catch the news or a movie on, but not in the way or taking up valuable space. The room served its purpose for us, which was mainly as a place to sleep between busy days sightseeing. I would reiterate the comment others have made about the stairs and doors. You do go through a few doors and probably one or two flights of staits on your way in and out so I would consider that if you think about staying here. At the end of the day, this was a pretty good hotel for the money and we would definitely think about staying here again.StaffThe staff was very friendly and helped us on a few occasions. First we needed to check in early and this wasn't a problem at all. Secondly, we needed a wake up call one morning to catch a train and when we discovered our room had no phone outlet, the front desk clerk (who was as surprised as us about the phone) volunteered to come by our room and knock on the door at 6AM so we could catch our train. LocationWe felt the location was great! It was a five minute walk to the West Kensington tube station which allows you to take the District Line to almost all of the major tourist attractions. It's not hard to switch trains in London, but if you can avoid it, why wouldn't you? There weren't a ton of places to eat near the hotel, but there were enough to get by if you had to. There was a pub/bar, a Chinese restaurant, and a few cafes that were open for breakfast and lunch. We mostly ate closer to the City Center, but on the few nights we were near the hotel we ate in the area and it was great. Finally, we definitely felt safe in the area, even walking at night from the tube station to our hotel."
41,890,Sep 25 2007	good budget accommodation	Myself and my friends stayed here for a weekend on a girly weekend. We found the accommodation perfect for our needs. Booked in at around 10 at night. We had two family rooms. One room had a double bed and bunk beds and the other room had 3 single beds and 2 bunk beds. We had more beds than we needed. Our rooms and ensuites were very clean. The hotel doesn't have a bar or a restaurant. We got hungary the first night so we just phoned down and they ordered a pizza for us no problem. There isn't much in West Kensington. There is a lovely cafe down the road for breakfast and we just got the tube to everywhere else. The tube station is only a 5 min walk away. This is a great place for a group of friends to stay.
42,890,"Aug 12 2007 	Ignore the bad reviewa!	After reading some of the previous reviews we were slightly apprehensive about what to expect but were VERY pleasantly surprised.Firstly, can I reassure you that the area is very pleasant and unthreatening. It's residential and there were no signs of the drunk men and hookers roaming the streets as the previous reviewer suggested! (In fact, our daughter lives just round the corner and found this very amusing!)The people in 24 hour reception were curteous and welcoming and everywhere was extremely fresh and clean. Our room was small but adequate - the bed was clean and comfortable and the shower room was sparkling.Best not to take advantage of the packed breakfast but there are a couple of cafes a few minutes' walk down the road where you can get a very well priced breakfast instead.We will definitely stay here again the next time we visit our daughter."
43,890,"Jul 23 2007 	Excellent value for money! Would go back definetely!!	I booked this hotel through Venere.com - booked for Olympia rooms - not sure why they differentiate, it's the same hotel. We paid 100 for a room for 4 people (room only, they do not offer breakfast but have coffe machine with free capuccino, expresso, hot chocolate, tea, etc).The hotel has been renovated recently and looks lovely. The staff are very pleasant and helpful, it was possible to leave our luggage in a secure room after the check out without extra charges.The room was of good space, considering there were one double bed and two single beds. The bathroom was great, spacious, new and very clean. Beds are comfortable.I would only say the window could be bigger and the curtains a bit darker, as the room was too hot to sleep (we were in the third floor and manage to sleep with the window open). Also the lift was out of order and no one offer to take our luggage up (we were four women, one being a senior).The location is excellent, near the underground, and seemed safe to walk during the night.There are a couple of places nearby to have breakfast in the morning (the 'continental' one - green building, was very good!).We would definetely return there."
44,890,"Jul 15 2007	Bad experience!!	The fine arts students at my school went on a field trip to London. We were all so excited. The day before, the chaperones told us our hotel was changed because our Comfort Inn was overbooked. I guess West Kensington is where you go when your hotel is overbooked.... So yeah...we all saw pictures on their site and they were random like, a light, a faucet, no pictures of the actual rooms really. There was one picture of a room that had a computer in it and looked really nice, but that room was nowhere to be found in the hotel. So, when our group first got there, there was a mountain of garbage outside of the front. Not very nice looking.... So, when we first got there, we were told our room wasn't finished being built, so we had no room to freshen up in after a 10 hour flight. So, 6 of us had to go in a 2-person room and all use that tiny bathroom. When we got back that night, our room was built. So we went down the nail-littered hallway with blood on the stairs, and got to our room finally. But, the room key didn't work. So, we had to go all the way back down the not-finished hallway with no carpets and wait for them to help us. Then when we got in our room, we noticed our only, minimal floor space was soaked. We complained to our tour guide and she told the staff who said it was &quot;just bleach spilt&quot;. So they put some towels on it for a bit and then left. So, we slept in that bleah-smelling room all night, not opening the windows because we were afraid of the area the hotel was in because it had hookers and drunk men yelling at us (we are only 17). The next day, we woke up late because our phone didn't work for wake up calls. We took our showers only to discover that the room was indeed JUST finished on account of things falling off the shower walls due to the heat. After one of us showered, we discovered we had no towels because they used them to &quot;clean&quot; up the bleach. So one of us went down to get more, but the person at the desk said he didn't have the key to get to them. So some of us had no towels. Coming back that night we were happy to hear we had a new room. We tried to watch the TV, but the remote was attached to the other side of the room which couldn't see the TV, because the bunk bed was blocking it. So we had to go up to the TV to change it. I had troubles with my bank and had no money so I had to call my mother in Canada, but the phone in the room wouldn't make outside calls and they wouldn't let me use their phone at the desk because it was their only line and they said they had to keep it open incase people wanted to make reservations. Nice. I had to walk down that scary street to a payphone to call and get it straightened out. It went on for a few days so every time I had to go to that payphone. Another person that was staying in another room had a horrible experience as well. He and his roomates admitted they broke the toilet seat. They received a bill for a toilet seat along with a shelf. They had no shelf in their room so they wondered what shelf they could be talking about. They told him it was the shelf in the bathroom. But, one remembered that the shelf was there one day and gone the next; the &quot;maid&quot; probably was wiping down the shelf, and the shelf being newly built, broke off. And they had to pay for it. A similar thing happened to another girl, her shelf fell off because it was newly glued. So, they charged him for a shelf he didn't even break.  Their &quot;lift&quot; didn't even work, although on their website they said they had a FULLY WORKING lift, so we had to lug our suitcases down the narrow hallways, marking up the walls, and almost fell down the stairs while trying to bring them up. The breakfast was not a breakfast. They made them up at 12 midnight and left them out until we came and got them around 7. It was orange juice, yogurt, and a crossaint from the corner store up the street. My friend was lactose intolerant, so she had nothing to eat. The &quot;housekeeping&quot; was terrible and probably non-existant. Our &quot;breakfast&quot; that was left on our floor (because the garbage can was too small) was there for our whole stay.We even moved them so the housekeeping would have to step over them to enter the room, but they still didn't throw them out. We had rotting orange juice and yogurt in our rooms the whole time. They also took my soap that I brought from my home because I have sensitive skin. I left it on the wonderful shelf and when I went back that night, it was gone."
45,890,"Jul 15 2007 	Fills a Niche - Recommended	I booked on lastminute and got a single room for 109. The room is small but full functional. The door from the corridor opens straight into bedroom. The room is taken up with a large queen or maybe king bed which occupies about 50% of the bedroom floor space. This might sound cramped, but it's fine. A flat screen TV is on a movable wall bracket above the bed. The bathroom/shower is in a seperate room, and is also pretty small, but clean and functional. There's free hot drinks from a machine in reception.Like a previous review, there's a lot of fire doors and stairs (especially if the lift isn't working), so I wouldn't recommend it for people who have difficulty climbing.Lastly, as also mentioned in other previous reviews, it's obviously been recently refurbished. You can still faintly detect the smell of fresh paint.This hotel is not luxuruous. But it is clean and functional. In my opinion, this place is great as a central location - 5mins from West Kensington tube - you probably won't find better."
46,890,"Jul 5 2007	okay...	hotel seems newly renovated. we thought we could smell paint (or a cat liter box) in one of the hallways.The hotel gives an interesting impression. the paint colors are white and greens (like the greens used in some schools and public buildings in the USA for a time). there are at 4-5 doors to walk through in the 20 feet from the front of the hotel to our hotel room, with multiple security locks. The bathroom in our room was a modular fiberglass unit. When in the hotel room the bathroom walls looked normal, but inside the bathroom it felt like a plastic box within the hotel room. the floor connects to the shower and walls and all were fiberglass. a great practical idea -- no way water will leak out because the whole bathroom is like a big piece of fiberglass Tupperware.The 'free' internet didn't work reliably at all and required watching ads to get started. the phone in our room didn't work either, and we ended up having to make calls home from the phone at the front desk.The single person at the desk was pleasant and helpful, but clearly was not an owner/manager and was limited in what could be done.The hotel is 5-10 minutes north of the West Kensington tube station.I wondered if breakfast was included after the fact, but we were not aware of it at the time. If we had eaten there it might have improved my view of the value of the hotel.This is not a terrible hotel, but I know that there are better."
47,890,"Jul 2 2007 	lovely hotel	I felt I had to write a review as i was a little anxious on my way down to london after reading some of the other reviews. 5 of us were staying in 2 rooms.Firstly when we arrived we were greeted at the reception by friendly,helpfull staff. We were given our swipe cards and off we went to our rooms. The guys room had a bathroom, tv and a double and single bed. Me and my fiance went into our room next door to theirs and found we had bunk beds! one phone call and ten minutes later we were transferred to a room with a double bed. There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms but there was a free machine in reception which had a wide variety of hot drinks, better than just the tea bags and sachets of coffee you usually receive in your room. Also there is no breakfast room, but you can buy a continental breakfast pack from reception to take to your room. Or there is a cafe round the corner that serves a good full english and pancakes :o)Rooms were fairly small but plenty big enough. Pull out flat screen tv's on the wall and comfy beds. Fire doors in corridoors were silenced so didn't bang everytime people opened them and didn't hear any noise from other rooms.I am guessing it is a recent refurb, very clean with nice fresh decor. Overall, a fabulous trip to london in a fabulous hotel :o)"
48,890,"Oct 16 2006 	very central	I stayed here in a triple room with my two sisters, for a long weekend. It only cost 120 for the room per night, including breakfast. For that money, it seemed good value, we couldn't find anything cheaper that was that central. It was an ideal location , close to Oxford Circus underground station. The room was fine, we got what we paid for. There were two single beds and a camp bed in the bedroom, and 2 comfy chairs and a tv. there wasn't much room for anything else in the room. The decor was a bit dated, but the room was clean. The bathroom was fine too, there was plenty of hot water, and the toilet was separate to the main bathroom, which was handy when sharing with 2 other girls. The breakfast room was quite small, but we got a table within 5 minutes every morning. Breakfast was buffet, and there was lots of food, so we were happy with that. On the second night we came back we were told that our room had been flooded so they'd moved us to another room. The second room was exactly the same as the first, and they'd put all our stuff exactly where we'd left it in the other room, so that was ok. The rooms were really quiet at night and the beds were quite comfortable, except for the campbed, which hadn't been put up properly, so it collapsed when someone sat on it. But we put it up properly, and it was fine from then on.Overall, I'd go back to this hotel. It was clean and well located and good value."
49,890,"Dec 6 2004	Never Again	It was as a result of being unable to book into my normal hotel (just across the road from the Aston Court) that I booked a night's stay at this hotel...The bedroom stank of stale tobacco smoke, the lavatory in the bathroom was not properly fixed to the floor and the shower curtain was due for a long overdue cleaning or replacement. The hotel itself was drafty, cold, unwelcoming and generally shabby. My twin room without breakfast was 95 for one night - if they halved the price it would still not be worth staying there! A truly unpleasant experience"
50,890,"Nov 29 2004	Not so great...	Ok in a pinch, but not someplace I would choose to stay again. Everything felt old and not so well taken care of. I wasn't happy with the feel or neighborhood of this place. Also, this was not a great place to stay if you were into walking to tourist attractions. On the plus side, the bathroom was decently sized and had great water pressure. There was also a great pizza place close by, and an awesome Sports Bar up the road."
51,890,"Aug 13 2004	What a Dump	The Aston Court Hotel is a dump. I don't mind staying in a low rent place if there is one good thing to redeem it, however, in this case there was not. It is in a poor location for experiencing London, the workers were not friendly or helpful, the room was cluttered, the bedcoverings old and worn, the hot water in the tub was a trickle. Do yourself a favor and do not stay here."

2,891,Jun 10 2006	Cheap but dingy	The staff was friendly
3,891,May 14 2006	Awesome for the price	I have seen so many bad reviews about this hotel - and they have all basically been because the people were obviously expecting a 5* hotel - get real people - it is pretty much the cheapest hotel in London - and I have to say I was pretty impressed.It was in a very green area of West London - very peaceful.We arrived at about 7.00pm after phoning ahead to get directions

1,900,Nov 25 2009 	Really nice week end break in beautifull hotel	A nice and friendly hotel in very convenient location. We really enjoyed our stay and will come back. The room was very good size with decent amenities and staff made us feel very welcome.Would recomment this hotel.
2,900,"Oct 28 2009 	Very Good Hotel	Good Location, in a nice quiet cul de sac, with the hustle and bustle only minutes away. Hyde Park not too far as well. Had after noon tea with the in-laws which was nice. We had a superior room which was very nicely decorated and comfortable. The guys and girls who worked there were also very friendly, offering us champagne when we arrived early and the room wasnt ready. Although this is probably not standard practice :-)Expensive hotel - but about average price for a london 5 star."
3,900,"Oct 15 2009 	Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful!	I stayed at the Knightsbridge hotel for 3 nights with my mom and sister. The triple room was spacious and extremely clean. The bathroom was HUGE and had a towel warmer. The service was impeccable and ambience was comfortable, yet stylish. The location could not be beat....very close to Harrod's but on a very quiet street. Also close to the Knightsbridge tube stop. The hotel is so quaintly and stylishly decorated, pictures are very close to reality. I would high recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting London."
4,900,"Aug 12 2009 	Immaculate Property	My friend and I stayed here for a week, each in our own single room, and it was a great experience. The staff was very accomodating and eager to help in any way possible to make our stay enjoyable. the room was small, but that was expected, the bathroom was very nice and the room and bath were kept SPOTLESS by the housekeeping staff.Great location for shopping and museums."
5,900,"Jul 28 2009 	Great service wonderful hospitable people neat as a pin superb location insulting and expensive Internet policy	We have stayed here before and this time was another example of what a boutique hotel can be like. We stayed here 6 nights between May and June, 2009. We enjoyed Immaculate, colorful floral arrangements, with a gracious polite staff which is always there to help, lovely room decor, excellent concierge service. And, as is often commented upon, beautiful bathrooms, not that you live in them, but they are luxurious and kept spotlessly clean as in your own home. Obviously, the location is wonderufl and we always stay in Knoghtsbridge. The hotel and the bar services are a little pricey, but you expect that in this neighborhood. What you don't expect is a 20 pound daily charge for Intenet services, ,even though it is contracted out to a provider. Since Internet is provided free at many pubs and lesser hotels, this outragious charge is an insult. For an establishment like this,internet should be considered part of the service, like hot water. It's a utility, not a profit center. And burying a 20 pound daily charge in the room rate is not a soluton. At most, I would put a value of 5 pounds a day on the service and include that rate in the room charge -- but not 20!!! This was a major irritation that was with us every day. The rest of the hotel's attributes more than balanced this out, but I give management a thumbs down on this issue to mar an otherwise lovely experience."
6,900,Jul 24 2009 	An Exceptional Gem	We discovered this beautifully designed boutique Hotel when we visited London to attend Wimbledon. We stayed at many extraordinary hotels on this trip but Knightsbridge is by far one of my favorite hotels of all time. I will go back for another visit when I am ready to drive in London again. Great restaurants nearby and of course Harrods is a bonus but the design of this hotel is what made it such an extraordianary experience and the Staff was wonderful!
7,900,"Jul 2 2009 	Excellent	We stayed here at the tail end of a long trip to Europe - and it was exactly what we needed. Like (as someone else mentioned) a home away from home. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. The rooms are well thought out and adorable. The location is great for shopping - Harrods, etc. I will stay there again next time I am in London. As one minor negative, the check out time of 11 needs to be changed to 12."
8,900,"Jun 9 2009 	Excellent 5* boutique hotel near Harrods with a homely feel	I spend 2 nights in the Knightsbridge hotel in March 2009 and really enjoyed my stay. The hotel location is great as it is off Brompton Road (with Harrods and other shops just 2 minutes away), in a very quiet dead-end street. The street is really nice as there are trees and all buildings are white with this charming typical English architecture.The hotel has a unique homely feel and has been decorated with elegance, style and originality. Each room has a different decor, which makes you want to come back and try a different room every time. The quality of service is excellent and the staff are all professional and helpful.The only down point in this hotel is that there is no restaurant. There is a 24 hour room service (with good quality food) however; and if you don't feel like eating your meal in your room or want to meet some friends, you can go down to the lovely Library room or the Drawing room. The clientele was quite diverse: families, couples, business men, etc., which is always a good sign for a hotel (I beleive).I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London."
9,900,"May 6 2009	Home away from home	An excellent hotel, providing first class service from the moment you walk through the door. The rooms are extravagant, and 'homely', with the food tasty and simple.The staff - fantastic, knowing exactly the kind of service you're after. Located near all the major shops in Knightsbridge, ideal for the shop-til-you-drop weekends, but also in a quiet road, for those relaxing breaks. A hidden gem in the world of hotels and I would highly recommend it."
10,900,Apr 28 2009 	Worth the Money	Well positioned yet quiet and convenient. Comfortable rooms which offer a restful night after a busy day in London. The reception team are pleasant and courteous.
11,900,"Apr 16 2009 	Great experience	My husband and I stayed 8 nights at the Knightsbridge Hotel around the Easter weekend. We told them that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and found champagne, chocolate coated strawberries and a bouquet of flowers in our room - a lovely surprise. we stayed in room 502, on the top floor, which is decorated in tones of green, pink and lilac. The romm had a huge, very comfortable bed, and a very large sitting area (it is actually one of teh larget room in the hotel). The bathroom is all marble, with a great shower/tub combo. The room faced the street that the hotel entrance is on, and I was surprised at how quiet it was, considering you are only a few hundre meters from Harrod's! Service was excellent; even if everyone working there is foreigner, they were very competetnt about directions and gave good recommendation for places to eat. We took every breakfast in the room, and even with a fully booked hotel, service was always thorough and on time. We actually dined in the room once, and the food was once again excellent. I loved the honesty bar system, very well stocked. The common area include the lobby, a sitting room and library (basically another, slightly smaller sitting room); all are very tastefully decorated, and we never found them crowded (howevr, we did not get back until 11pm or later most nights). Overall, a lovely stay, and a place I woudl recommend to friends and family."
12,900,"Feb 17 2009 	Loved the Location!	I recently stayed at the Knightsbridge hotel for 5 days in Jan for Business. What can I say, the location is the best! If you are looking for something close to shopping, cafe's, etc without staying in a crowded tourist run location, This is it. The rooms are on the small side, I highly encourage you to get the upgrade to suite. decor is fabulous and the Honor Bar systems is fabulous! staff is friendly and helpful! We will return!"
13,900,"Feb 6 2009 	wonderfull stay a gem	i will start by saying that on jully i am going back and i will stay there again. first of all the hotel is in super location near harrords and bictoria line that is the most convinient. the rooms are wonderfull, beatifully decorated with marvelous bathroom. the hotel is colorfull and vivid and the front desk is superhelpfull. the area is quiet despite being in the center and both the hotel and the area are clean."
14,900,Dec 25 2008 	Excellent Service	I stayed through a reccomendation of a friend who had previously stayed here. The hotel is in a calm area of knightsbridge. I stayed in a deluxe room which was very delightful and had ample enough of working space. All the staff were genuienly nice and helpful. Definetely looking forward to my next stay.
15,900,"Dec 17 2008 	Looking forward to the next visit!	I stayed at the Knightsbridge over a weekend, and can highly recommend the Hotel. It is very central for shopping and easy access to central London for Business. The Hotel had a great relaxed atmosphere and the room was very well presented and comfortable. It is highly recommended for the discerning guest. All the Staff were friendly and helpful, which makes for a more easy stay as an international traveller and I look forward to my next visit."
16,900,"Dec 7 2008 	Fab Boutique Hotel	This was our fourth stay and feels like &quot;home away from home&quot;. Can't say enough about this hotel, especially decor, staff and location right in the heart of Knightsbridge. Nothing has changed over the 3 years we have stayed here.Although the hotel may be busy, it is always seems to be a calm haven. At this time of the year it is wonderful to come in and sit in front of the fire in the lounge. We often met friends here and felt very comfortable sitting in either the lounge or library and being able help yourself to a drink from the honesty bar. Room service is a little pricey !"
17,900,"Oct 20 2008 	Fantastic	Really loved this boutique hotel. Right in the centrer of Knightsbridge, close to Harrods, but quiet. Very friendly and helpful staff in every area. Nothing too much trouble. Will stay there again next time."
18,900,"Jul 5 2008 	A Gem!!	The Knightsbridge is an amazing boutique hotel. My husband and I stayed here celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary - it is an ideal romantic hotel! The hotel and rooms are warm and inviting and decorated well. The staff was very accomodating and we received water and chocolate every night when we returned home. The location cannot be beat, just minutes from Harrods and excellent restaurants. It's a bit pricey but worth it if you want a memorable stay!!"
19,900,"Jun 29 2008	Fantastic hotel	We stayed in the Knightsbridge Hotel, Beaufort Gardens, for only one night in June. Everything was superb from the brilliantly friendly and helpful staff to the beautifully designed and furnished bedroom and guest rooms. It is a fabulous hotel in a great location with great staff."
20,900,Jun 27 2008 	More to do	Great location and staff. Room a little crammed but clean and well maintained. Two nice lounges and an honesty bar well stocked. Breakfast disappointing and not up to other hotel standards. The price structure of breakfast is misleading. Nice stay hotel can improve.
21,900,"Jun 11 2008 	Great Stay	My husband and I recently spent a weekend in the Knightsbridge Hotel and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived we really felt that the hotel was a peaceful, relaxing haven in the middle of London. Our room (luxury double) was very comfortable and had lots of extra little touches that really made our stay enjoyable and memorable. The breakfast menu was extensive and although not exactly cheap, we thought it was well worth it. We also had a few drinks on one evening from the well stocked honesty bar, and spend a very peaceful hour in the drawing room.The staff were helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. They were only too happy to help when we asked for directions and we found them courteous and pleasant in all of our dealings with them. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Knightsbridge Hotel, we'll certainly return."
22,900,Jun 8 2008 	Very High end	What a great hotel. We booked the Knightsbridge as the final two nights of a two week vacation. It was definitely the nicest place we stayed (and all were great places). Our room was a little small but was overall a great room. It was expensive but I blame that on the exchange rate and W.
23,900,"May 19 2008 	Convenient and Cool	An eclectic, nouveau hip well-located boutique hotel in Knightsbridge, steps from Harrod's, a few minutes from Kensington Gardens, etc. My only complaint is the ridiculously over-priced wireless (20 pounds an hour??)."
24,900,May 6 2008 	Nice hotel watch the breakfast costs	We stayed last weekend and were very disappointed with the lack of communication about the actual costs of breakfast.We found this at best confusing and at worse deceptive.On the booking confirmation it indicated that breakfast was included.On the breakfast request card there were no prices.The only prices were in the room service pack which we had not read.There was no kettle in the room enabling us to make a hot drink. On ordering tea the cost was not 4.00 as stated but actually 4.43 why not list it as this on the price list.The hotel itself was attractive but the breakfast fiasco spoilt it for us.
25,900,"Apr 1 2008 	FANTASTIC location 	We were a party of 5 celebrating a birthday and thoroughly enjoyed our Easter stay. From the fresh water and chocolates every night, to the complimentary champagne for my birthday, to the bottle of wine to apologise for a small accident in the bathroom... you couldn't fault their service. Excellent rooms with attention to detail, quality fittings and much needed complimentary umbrellas! Food was very good too and the honesty bar was fab. Would definitely recommend and be back when in London!!!"
26,900,"Mar 11 2008	Wonderful experience	Our four night stay at the Knightsbridge made our holiday in London all the more memorable. The hotel has a real warmth which you notice as soon as you walk in the door. Our room was fabulous. All of the staff were superb, always friendly and nothing was a problem. Special mention must go to Per, the head concierge, who went out of his way to help us with anything we needed. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to have a fantastic London experience!Brett and Amanda, Gold Coast, Australia"
27,900,Jan 21 2008 	Wonderful Hotel	Perfect location for shopping and although the hotel has no restaurant room service and food is excellent! Could not fault the staff who were so friendly and helpful including a lady on reception who helped us out when my husband was ill. Would definitely stay here again.
28,900,"Jan 4 2008	Loved this hotel	The property and staff were lovely. I felt chic as soon as I walked in. The three lobby spaces are beautifully decorated-modern but not minimalist. Each evening I had a drink in the library and felt like I was staying in a modern english country house. Most importantly for me, the hotel felt very new and very clean. My room, a superior single, was small but beautiful-exactly what I expected from the website. The closet was large, there was a good place to put my suitcase, the bathroom was big and beautiful, though there was no tub, just a shower-be sure to request a tub. The location was perfect-walk to Harrods, Harvey Nichols, the V and A, the natural history museum. Close to underground. Really a perfect place to stay. My only recommendations are to request a room on the front-I chose a back facing room thinking it would be quieter, but the from street is very quiet and a nicer view. Also ask for a tub if you want one. The staff is young, friendly, and tech savvy. One guy checked my fight home for me online so I didn't have to hold on the phone.I would go again tomorrow if I could."
29,900,"Jan 2 2008 	Cute and convenient	This is a cute hotel in a very convenient location in Knightsbridge. It is a quick walk to Harrods and the museums. The hotel itself is intimate and boutique style with an interesting &quot;honesty bar,&quot; which is a well stocked pantry in the lobby that you take what you want and just sign on a sign out sheet. The hotel is decorated very tastefully with interesting art and the room is both attractive and comfortable. I would classify it as casual luxury. One warning; I got the superior double and it was tiny! I would definately stay here again."
30,900,"Nov 22 2007 	Great Experience!	The Knightsbridge Hotel was recommended to us by a friend, the location is superb, the rooms and accommodation first class. The staff were warm, attentive and very professional. The rooms have an english charm and it is the little details that makes it like no ordinary hotel. We have stayed on two seperate occasions and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that appreciates comfort in a stylish setting."
31,900,"Oct 18 2007	Great Hotel	We stayed at the Knightsbridge for 4 nights Oct 4-8. The hotel is very well located on a quiet street right near Harrod's, etc.. We walked everywhere. Our friend lives in Chelsea and it was only a 20 minute walk. The hotel also booked a private car for us to tour around a bit.The room was spacious and very affordable (for London standards, still $650/night). The bathroom was big and we got a newspaper every morning. The hotel lobby has a very nice sitting area with fireplace. Very comfortableI would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again."
32,900,"Oct 2 2007 	Quiet Gem overlooking Harrods	Travelers from San Francisco AreaWe arrived at the Knightsbridge Hotel very early on a Sunday morning expecting to drop off our luggage and drag ourselves around London until our room was available and we could nap.Much to our surprise we were immediately shown to our room, a bit on the small side but big on charm. Everything in the room, from the lamps to the bath sachets translated to cool! We had a wall of windows overlooking the Harrods' dome which is lighted at night! One would expect such an area to be noisy and crowded but the Knightsbridge is halfway down a cul-de-sac, which insures quiet right in the heart of Knightsbridge!Breakfast was included and served in our room at the appointed time. Although a simple breakfast it was some of the best food we had in London. The bath was large with lovely bath products including a delightful box of bath sachets.I just wish our dollar were stronger so we could return more quickly to the Knightsbridge."
33,900,"Sep 24 2007 	Highly Recommend	Myself and my husband stayed in this hotel last week. We stayed two nights. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough, the room was gorgeous, the staff really helpful, it's really near the tube, harrods, harvey nichols etc. I will definitely be staying in this hotel again."
34,900,"Aug 29 2007 	Concierge sucks...	The rooms are very nice (except that our a/c was loud), the location is great BUT the concierge sucks!!! when my husband and I travel we like to stay in nice hotels not only for the rooms ect but for the concierge and hotel services. We tried to book tikets for a movie one night and it was such a to do they could not do it.. I can't imagine if I tried to book show tickets through them. Overall its a nice hotel but I probably won't stay here again. Eat at amaya its a fabulous indian restaurant..."
35,900,"Aug 21 2007 	Another great Firmdale Hotel	This is our 3rd stay in a Firmdale Hotel and I'm starting to sound like a paid sales rep. We have already tried Soho and Covent Garden and now Knightsbridge. Once again this hotel hits all the marks. You have two choices for parking, next door at the Harrods car park or directly outside where the concierge will feed the meter until 6pm whereafter its free. They take care of the congestion charge as well - all makes for a hassle free stay. The rooms and interior decor are just beautiful. There is no dining room as such but you can take breakfast in one of the ground floor rooms. We chose breakfast in bed which was a real treat. The staff are wonderful, extremely helpful and very courteous - I think Firmdale must be cloning them somewhere. The location for shopping is brilliant being tucked away in a quiet close but immediately between Sloane Square/Kings Road and Harrods. There are numerous great restaurants around. If you are fed up with the ubiquitous Hilton/Marriott/Shearton blah blah then these hotels are just perfect. Same price but in a different league."
36,900,"Aug 6 2007 	Well looked after	We stayed with friends at this hotel just a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Normally we stay in the large chains such as Hilton but for a change we decided to taste the boutique experience. We are glad we did, the Knightbridge had a home from home feel about it and although has no formal dining rooms has lovely comfy lounges perfect for that pre-show/post shopping glass of champagne. The honesty bar is well stocked with everything from champers to cocktail making kits. Breakfast is served in this room too however we chose to take it in our room which was far more self indulgent. The staff were polite and attentive. Dino the concierge was very helpful and nothing seemed too much trouble. Even though this hotel is just off the main road it feels very secluded.The down part -Our friends room although beautiful and spotless were small, however this was made up for by the frette linen and miller and harris products. Our room was fine so its pretty much luck of the draw. I will def be staying here again."
37,900,"Jul 16 2007	Excellent boutique hotel Excellent Location	Stayed at this hotel for two nights. Had a great experience. I would highly recommend this hotel to tourists to London.Hotel is small but extremely well designed across a couple of large traditional London townhouses situated in a quiet square just off Knightsbridge in central london. Its a fantastic location for leisure travellers: easy access to harvey nicks, restaurants, museums, cabs, tube.Rooms are well designed clean bright. Bathrooms were large and well equipped. Staff were helpful, enthusiastic and polite. Concierge was excellent. Communal areas chic and clean. As a boutique hotel they didnt have a formal bar but the communal honesty bar was extremely well stocked - hagen daz, snacks and any and every drink you could think of. (I didnt use room service so couldnt comment on it)Previously stays in London have been at the Berkley, Claridges, Dorchester, The Parkes hotel and the Met.This hotel as a boutique hotel i'd rate very favourably against any of them. I would highly recommend it. For London its extremely good value for money."
38,900,"Apr 8 2007 	Excellent stay	Recently stayed here for two nights. Great hotel with excellent service and location. We ate breakfasts in the common rooms which were stylish. Although no gym, it's close to Hyde Park for those who like to jog. Only minus was the small size of the room which was small even for London. The room, however, was very nicely appointed and spotless. Other minus was the wireless internet which was very slow."
39,900,"Feb 18 2007 	Great Times	I would recommend this hotel to anyone - great location, very quiet &amp; peaceful, beautifully decorated, great attention to detail, pleasant &amp; helpful staff, good food..."
40,900,"Jan 17 2007 	What a wonderful hotel!	My husband and I stayed at The Knightsbridge recently for three nights. The hotel was absolutely lovely; our room was beautiful,and the granite bathroom was well appointed. The lobby and drawing rooms were charming and cozy, with the fireplaces lit and comfortable sofas and chairs.I have never stayed at any hotel where the staff were as warm, friendly and courteous as this one.They were extraordinarily helpful and gracious, and wonderful with recommendations and reservations.It is located on a lovely, peaceful street, perfectly located near Harrods, and certainly within walking distance to many attractions.There is not a restaurant, so you must take your breakfast either in your room or one of the drawing rooms, but that was not a problem for us at all.It was a wonderful stay, and I look forward to returning! I highly recommend this lovely hotel."
41,900,"Jan 7 2007 	One of the best hotel experiences ever	We stayed here over Christmas and it was one of the best hotel experiences ever. The staff was extremely helpful and attentive. They even left us gifts on Christmas! The sitting rooms were warm and inviting with fireplaces, mulled wine and library."
42,900,"Jan 4 2007 	Brilliant Design Hotel In Knightsbridge	The Knightsbridge Hotel is beautifully appointed design hotel only a block from Harrods and a short stroll to Sloane Street shopping. Very nice lounges with adjoining honesty bar. Smart decor. We stayed over New Years for three nights in a junior suite at about $700.00 US. Nicer accommodation than most New York hotels. Gorgeous, though small granite bath. Large room with all the bells and whistles, great design, flat screen tv with dvd, comfortable seating and good lighting. Great food and service. Breakfast included in the rate--either set offerings or a la carte--not a typical English breakfast with many different offerings from eggs benedict to Canadian pancakes. Excellent service and very friendly, cordial staff. Would highly recommend. The only tip is to carefully review your bill upon departure as sometimes the honesty bar charges are totaled for the day and added as a single line item or entered indvidually. Breakfast is included up to GBP of 16.50 per person; again, charges can appear individually. All over charges were handled discretely and politely."
43,900,"Dec 18 2006 	A pleasant stay	We stayed two nights in December, and paid 200 GBP per night for a standard double. The hotel lobby was pleasant but we didn't spend any time there as it was always too fully occupied to get a seat on the plush sofas. Perhaps this is to be expected during the weekend before Christmas.We arrived on Friday at 2pm, the stated check in time, as did a number of other guests. The staff seemed unable to cope with the rush, and asked us to sit in the lobby, where we waited for 10 or 15 minutes to be checked in. However, the staff were always pleasant, and helpful. I liked the free DVD rental from the front desk, and the DVD players in every room.Our room was small but very comfortable, and spotlessly clean, overlooking a quiet street at the back of the hotel. The bathroom was a delight, with bathrobes and lots of fluffy towels. The only odd thing was that since the hotel has no restaurant or breakfast room, you are obliged to have breakfast in your room. Ok, no problem, except our room was so small, it had no table or chairs, meaning we had to eat sitting on the bed. This wasn't a problem, in fact it was quite nice to have breakfast in bed with the (complementary) Sunday papers.Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. It was always a pleasure to turn off the busy Brompton Road into the quiet tree lined cul-de-sac, and return 'home' for a rest."
44,900,"Nov 24 2006 	Loved the Knightsbridge	I took my mother for a surprise birthday present to London and we stayed at the Knightsbridge after reviewing several hotels using Trip Advisor. The Hotel itself is in an excellent location, very close to the major shops and close to the tube but it is in a very quiet road. Inside it is simple but beautiful. The staff were very friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome. Our room although not huge was wonderful, the decor was beautiful and just like what they show on their website. The bathroom again was not big but it was immaculate, there were plenty of big bath towels and the shower was lovely and powerful. It was the little touches as well that made our stay so special. They came and turned down the bed and put slippers out for us, complimentary bottles of water and a newspaper in the morning, a hairdryer that was not connected to the wall, an umbrella in the cupboard for us to use during our stay, also, my favourite, hangars that come out of the wardrobe so you can hang your clothes properly without having to struggle. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and my mother has already decided that she would like to go back with my father and some of their friends."
45,900,"Oct 25 2006 	Loved this hotel!	This hotel is wonderful and Ive recommended it to many people. It is a warm and charming hotel with a great location; close to the bustle of city life but a block away so it is a quiet location. We arrived at 10am after a 9-hour flight from Dallas and were offered early check-in so we were able to get into our room upon arrival. The room itself was very comfortable (nothing generic about it  decor is charmingly distinctive) and the bathroom was spacious and modern. The room comes with a mini-bar, hairdryer and even an umbrella for inclement weather (we hadnt packed one). We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast and it was always wonderful  it was as good as what wed get at a restaurant. Because wed had such a long flight we went to bed early our first night there (about 7pm) and our room was so well insulated that we didnt hear one peep from another room around us. The staff was superb and extremely helpful with reservations and suggestions. One thing we didnt like is that it that smoking is allowed in the lobby and common areas, as is the case in most European cities (weve learned to live with it). We will be back to London and will definitely stay at this hotel again!!"
46,900,"Oct 24 2006 	Cozy bright boutique hotel in Knightsbridge	Beautiful upscale boutique hotel with terrific, friendly service, tasteful and amusing decor and nice location, very close to Harrods, Hyde Park. Pricey, but that's London. Can't think of a single thing to complain about, it's that nice. Room service wasn't bad at all, the beds are really comfortable. Beautiful street, quiet and relaxing. Apparently all the hotels in the Firmdale group are excellent."
47,900,"Sep 9 2006 	Lovely Stay	This is a great hotel on a quiet side street two blocks from Harrods. I stayed in a single room, which while small, was really nice and comfortable. The Miller Harris toiletries were great. The turndown service was lovely, with nice linen sprays and aromatic oils.I have also stayed at their sister hotel Number Sixteen, which I liked but had such thin walls as to be absurd (I could hear my neighbors whispering). This was a much more pleasant experience and I can't wait to stay here again."
48,900,"Sep 5 2006 	An Oasis in Busy Knightsbridge	I had the pleasure of staying 6 nights at the Knightsbridge while on business in London. The Beaufort Gardens location is peaceful yet just a half block from the bustling shops and restaurants of Brompton Road. The Piccadilly Line was easily accessible via the Knightsbridge Tube Station by Harrod's.Although small by U.S. standards, my room was comfortable and the bathroom was large with a wonderful bathtub. The hotel staff was friendly and solicitous. Upon arriving early for check-in, I was served a lovely tea in the drawing room while they prepared my room. A nice touch and welcome after the long flight.I will look forward to staying at the Knightsbridge again for business travel but must confess it would be too expensive for a family trip."
49,900,"Aug 27 2006	Wonderful Hotel	My wife and I stayed at the Knightsbridge Hotel earlier this month. Our room was beautifully decorated, quiet and had a nice view of Beaufort Gardens. The location is excellent. While expensive, it was reasonable by London standards. We would definitely stay there again."
50,900,"Jul 5 2006	Don't think we'd go back to the Knightsbridge	This hotel's location on a quiet tree lined street is one of it's best assets. The rooms are smartly decorated, although small, and the staff are quite attentive. However, some of the extras that we were charged for were a bit over the top. Five Pounds for a bucket of ice in our room? It's small details like this that will prevent us from recommending the Knightsbridge to friends."
51,900,"Jul 4 2006	Still Exceptional	The most amazing part of staying at this hotel is how you can step off busy Brompton Road and find yourself in a quiet, sedate street that seems miles away from the traffic and commerce. The owners continue to find young, friendly staff and the hotel standards are as exceptional today as they were when we were among the first guests a few years ago."
52,900,"Jun 28 2006	Once again a wonderful Firmdale hotel!	My wife and I spent a night at the Knightsbridge last week on our stop through London to meet friends. We had spent nine nights at Firmdales Soho Hotel last year and loved it. Due to our limited time in London this year, we decided one located closer to where we needed to be made more sense. Even though the Knightsbridge is in a row of converted townhouses, it still maintained the gently edgy feel we liked so much at the Soho. It would placate the chintz crowd better than the Soho might, but still in a quiet, subtle way. As we expected, we arrived from the airport ahead of the posted check in time and were politely told our room was indeed not yet ready. When we offered to leave our bags and return later, the staff made a call to housekeeping to put us first on their list and had tea, coffee and biscuits arranged for us in the lounge (these refreshments never appeared on our bill). The room was much like those at the Soho, bright, clean and large by London standards. We did miss the full wall of glass the Soho offers, but the same high quality of the room was there. Check out was just as smooth with a taxi arranged at check out and we found it out front, our luggage loaded precisely on time. We are looking forward to trying out the next Firmdale opening in the fall on our next visit."
53,900,"Jun 12 2006	Fantastic	I just returned from a couple of days at the Knightsbridge. We stayed there on the recommendation of a friend. As always staying at a new hotel, I was nervous about what to expect. The hotel was truly fantastic. I have been lucky enough to stay at some amazing hotels around the world, including many boutique hotels, and this ones holds it own against any of them. We checked in and were put in a room in the lower level. It was a beautiful, huge room but I was concerned about the noise. I asked to change and the staff could not have been more helpful. They moved us to a room on the fifth floor overlooking the street that was incredibly light filled and beautiful. It was slightly smaller but still a large size for a city hotel. The appointments were very well done with a large comfortable bed and sitting area.The public rooms are simply beautiful. Modern and well done yet very inviting. The honesty bar is a nice addition and it was great to grab a drink and hang out in the salon. Friends were staying across the street at the Parkes hotel and spent most of their time with us in the salon talking and having a great time. It is like staying with a very fashionable, incredibly gracious friend who is hosting you in their house. Finally, the staff. They are young, energetic and could not have been nicer or more helpful. They helped us out on a number of things ranging from some business issues to recommending places to eat. I strongly recommend this hotel and will staying at this or another Firmdale hotel on my next trip to London."
54,900,"Jun 2 2006	Wonderful hotel great location	My family and I stayed here for seven nights and really enjoyed this hotel. Our rooms were spotless and large, and the decor was lovely. We liked the dressmaker's mannequins (small and large) in every room (useful also for draping raincoats over!). The hotel is on a lovely quiet residential street but right off busy Brompton Road for easy access to cabs, bus, tube and stores/shops/restaurants.We booked the only adjoining rooms so my husband and I could be next to our fourteen-year-old daughter. This was her first &quot;solo&quot; room and she loved it. If you have girls, they will love Room 1 (which can be adjoined via an small indoor passage to Room 5 - each room has a glass door to the hallway so my daughter could stay up late watching MTV UK and we never heard the TV, but she still felt connected to our room). Number 1 is a lovely deep pink room with a gorgeous wild-poppy floral pattern on the bed, draperies, etc. My two big sons shared a luxury double with two twin beds (joined like a king which freaked them out at first) but made up separately for their individual use. The only downside to our room, (#5) was that the windows were at street level and cars going into an apartment complex were often driving around right outside --or loading in passengers -- felt less than private with draperies open! Our room , like the others, had, in addition to the bed, a sofa with coffeetable and an armchair. Televisions had cable access and a DVD player in each room was welcome, especially because the hotel had a large DVD library from which you could borrow for free! Another nice touch -- bottled water by the bed after turn-down service.The bathrooms - - magnificent. Spotless, huge, marble, with bidet and toilet, heated towel racks, large tubs, terry robes, slippers, Miller Harris amenities. The location cannot be beat -- steps from Harrods, just a few steps more to Harvey Nichols, and in tony Knightsbridge with fabulous shopping. Tube stop (Knightsbridge) just by Harrods, so convenient (though check your schedules...the Brompton Road exit from the Knightsbridge station -- the one closest to the hotel -- closes late at night and parts of the weekend. You just have to walk a little father from the Sloane Street exit.).Close casual dining options (good for kids) are Wagamama and a Chinese place (the Good Earth?) and Pizza express. A McDonalds on the corner if you must... Also apparently a very good Thai nearby though we never went. Several little french/gelato places steps away. Went to a great (expensive) fancy Japanese restaurant on the recommendation of the hotel...The honesty bar and (small) public rooms were lovely and a welcome touch. Though the hotel has no restaurant, the room service was delicious and prompt. My kids loved the pancakes and bacon...bacon in London is different from the US and particularly wonderful!Coffee was divine with double cream -- if pricey at 4.00GBP (about $8.00!)Only small downside -- the staff, while VERY nice and accomodating, didn't seem to know a lot of things you'd expect front desk/ concierge staff to know. (Notwithstanding the one good dinner reservation above). Often the front desk staff was overwhelmed with guests, and the &quot;concierge&quot; might not be available. The &quot;concierge&quot; didn't know Harrod's hours, didn't know some well-known restaurants, couldn't help us with some day trip issues, but at least they TRIED. (They were mostly very young and good-natured, and many of them were non-natives and seemed to know little of London.)This hotel was quite spendy -- especially with the terrible exchange rate. But it was a wonderful place. We would definitely stay there again."
55,900,"May 12 2006	Charming quiet boutique hotel	The Knightsbridge Hotel is an oasis of calm in the large and sometimes overwhelming city of London. Set on a quiet street near the famous Harrod's department store, it's the perfect place to get a sound night's sleep or recharge your batteries after a long day of sightseeing or shopping. The lobby, drawing room and reading room are all very intimate and stylishly designed. The honesty bar is stocked with a wide range of spirits, wines, champagnes and snacks. The rooms are a bit smaller than I expected, especially considering I paid 200 pounds a night for a &quot;luxury&quot; room. But they are very beautifully designed. The staff is mostly very attentive and helpful, even packing breakfast for us to take on a day trip outside of London one Sunday morning. But due to the small size of the hotel, the staff can easily become overwhelmed at the front desk. If the phone is ringing and more than one guest is at the desk seeking assistance, it can take several minutes for your needs to be attended to. The concierge made some excellent restaurant and tour company recommendations, but in person, the concierges sometimes seemed a bit uninformed. We are a younger couple in our late twenties, so we might have appreciated a hotel with a more active lobby and social scene, but it really was a nice place to be for three nights. I would recommend it to any discerning couple or tourist seeking a quiet, stylish place to stay."
56,900,"Jan 6 2006	Simply-Lifetime Best Hotel	Although it has been many years, the experince of this Hotel stays in my mind. In a word, Perfection. Everything a proper hotel should be - quite, small, exquisitely and originally decorated with a staff you only wish would marry into your family. This is a tastfully, understated slice of heaven."
57,900,"Dec 7 2005	a truly lovely hotel	we stayed at the Knighstbridge for three nights and we were sad to leave. The rooms are beautiful and bathrooms well-appointed. I'm a very picky hotel person and I loved everything about this place. The location is superb. The public rooms are perfect for meeting friends, or reading the newspaper. They will even deliver your breakfast to you there and you can sit by the fire and enjoy your tea. But more importantly, the service is excellent. This is what separates good from great, in my mind. We asked to switch rooms after our first night...the bathroom was a bit chilly and the weather in London had become quite cold the week we were there. The front desk staff was very kind and immediately changed our room, upgrading us to a larger double. Throughout our stay, everyone at the Knighstbridge was gracious and helpful. Absolutely a delightful hotel."
58,900,"Nov 28 2005	A little Gem!	What can I say about the Knightsbridge Hotel, other than &quot;Near Perfection&quot;. We stayed here on the occasion of our 25th Wedding Anniversary, and could not have wished for a more pleasant place to start a memorable trip.The Location is great if you love to shop. It's just around the corner from Harrods, and multitudes of chic boutiques. Unfortunately, it's that proximity to fantastic shopping venues in the area, that takes this wonderful hotel from Perfection to &quot;Near Perfection&quot;, as it can be difficult to get to if you are driving your own vehicle. The welcome we received was outstanding. We arrived early, our room was not ready, but instead of letting us fend for ourselves, we were treated to tea and cookies in the lounge. Nothing beats a cup of tea, in a comfy chair, beside a crackling fire. The Concierge's were about the best we've seen. Small or large requests were handled with &quot;My pleasure&quot;. A big one for us... They arranged to have our car parked when they noted that we were a bit &quot;frazzled&quot; from our drive in from Heathrow. They also sent up some small gifts to welcome us, and wish us a Happy Anniversary! Very thoughtful. Our room - 108, was beautiful. The decor richly simple and elegant. The bathroom can only be described as a woman's fantasy... Bright lights, makeup mirror, and a tub so big I could float. The complimentary toiletries were of top quality, and small touches such as cotton swabs and makeup removal pads were just icing on the cake.Breakfast was superb. &quot;Seasonal Berries&quot; garnered me a huge bowl of fresh strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries. My husband had the Full English Breakfast, and didn't need to eat until Dinner. We definately recommend this hotel! It's wonderful!"
59,900,"Nov 25 2005	Perfect in every way	We only stayed one night, but everything was so perfect and even better than portrayed on their web pages. Food brilliant (we had a lunch in the Library and a lovely breakfast). Our rooms were artistic and spotlessly clean with everything we could possibly want. All the staff were so helpful, courteous and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble and we would definately stay here again."
60,900,"Nov 25 2005	wonderful time at the Knightsbridge in London	We spent six nights at the Knightsbridge Hotel (part of the Firmdale Hotels) which is located one block from Harrods, on a quiet side street. It is a lovely hotel, just the right size for us, about 40 rooms. Although they do not have any type of food on site, that was no problem, as there are so many wonderful places to have a meal or grab a cup of coffee. We stayed in a double deluxe room, which was rather small, but I don't think that is unusual for London. It had a wonderful down duvet, queen size bed, flat screen tv, desk and couch in the room. The bathroom was completely granite with a large tub/shower. The closet was rather small but served us well, there was a great mini-bar (expensive, as they all are) and in-room safe. We were delivered a paper every morning and they did a beautiful turn-down in the evening. They are great about details including a hand written welcome note from the manager. We were quite pleased with everything and don't have one bad thing to say, we would stay at ANY Firmdale Hotel after our experience!"
61,900,Nov 23 2005 	stayed many times always great!	Over the past 3 years I've stayed here atleast 8 times for business &amp; pleasure for anything upto a week at a time. Staff are always friendly and helpful &amp; room service always delivered on time. Location is great for shopping - Harrods etc down the road &amp; also more interesting shops on Beauchamp Place &amp; Brompton Cross. Rooms are great - comfortable &amp; cozy. Standard double is too small for a couple staying more than a couple of nights though. Great hotel - highly recommended &amp; I'm fussy!!
62,900,Oct 18 2005 	Perfect Haven	Finest boutique hotel I found in London. A perfect off-beat location. Extremely attentive staff. Nice comfortable rooms. A place to come back to
63,900,"Oct 11 2005 	Some credit	The hotel is nice and in a hip location as wellUnfortunately, due to miscalculations I was without accomodation for one night in London. I tried to check in using my debit card but...The hotel wouldn't accept it as a guarantee (I can understand that) and could only get aproval by calling the bank (which is not enough for a debit card).I had to rush to a Barclays in Brompton Rd to get the money in order to finaly check in to the hotel. Have I mentioned it was pouring?The ways of payment should really be more up-to-date"
64,900,"Jun 14 2005	Fantastic	The Hotel is tucked away on a quiet, residential street in Knightsbridge. Harrods and other high end shopping stores are only a few blocks away. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and courteous. The rooms are nice, clean, bright but small. The Hotel offers two sitting rooms with fireplaces and an honesty bar for late night cocktails. The Hotel attracts locals as well as out of towners. I highly recommend the Knightsbridge!"
65,900,"May 6 2005 	Lovely	Really nice boutique hotel on a quiet side street near Harrods. Our room was really nice, wonderful bathroom. The service was superb (almost scary how well they anticipated our needs). The downstairs lobby/sitting areas were very cozy. The location was very good. A short walk to Hyde Park and to Tube stops. Good restaurants, but not a huge number. Luckily we were on a business trip. I don't think we could afford it on our usual budget, though."
66,900,"May 5 2005 	Excellant Location and atmosphere	This hotel is in a fantastic location very close to Harrods, but it's off the main busy road, so traffic noise isn't a problem. The staff are very friendly and after a long journey the little things like arranging for tea and coffee to be delivered to the room was a nice touch. The breakfast &quot;to-go&quot; is a great idea as I had an early start the following morning and my tea, orange juice and danish were all packed ready for me when I left.Highly recommend this hotel"

10,904,Oct 25 2008 	Very good	I stayed in the youth wing- the accommodation is basic but was the best basic accommodation I have seen for a long time. Everything was spotlessly clean
11,904,Jun 18 2008 	Life Saver	When the hotel we were booked into turned out to be really no good
12,904,May 19 2008 	Very Basic Hotel.	This is a very basic hotel but good value at the price. It is very conveniently located near Lancaster Gate tube station and is within short walking distance of Paddington mainline rail station. I was there on my own for two nights and the hotel fulfilled my requirements of somewhere clean and safe in which to stay. The best description of the room is spartan. There were no touches of luxury (nor was I expecting any at the price) nor were there tea/coffee making facilities
13,904,May 14 2008 	Lucky second option	After arriving from the airport at 7am to find our original booked hotel closed (had advised our flight times
14,904,Feb 28 2008 	Great hotel!	My husband and I stayed at this hotel last summer with our son
15,904,Jan 6 2008 	Clean and basic with a good location and price	I stayed in a youth wing room (shared bathrooms) for a week last January. The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing and is very quiet and clean. The morning continental breakfast is nice. The shared bathrooms were cleaner than I usually find in places with shared bathrooms
16,904,Jun 19 2006	Can't believe it's the same place	From a regular business traveller in the UK. I just stayed at the Lancaster Hall Hotel
17,904,May 29 2006	Fabulous friendly and affordable	I stayed with my husband and 3yr old daughter for a week in May and had a thoroughly fantastic time. Our room was exceptionally clean and was light and airy

20,904,Nov 17 2004	Clean as a whistle great location and great breakfast!	Just great
21,904,Jul 25 2004	Superb value for money - and a good breakfast	I have stayed in the Youth Wing a number of times and find it clean and excellent value for money. I am a 50yrs old and its fine to stay there when travelling on a budget.The staff are very efficient and friendly. I like it there and will always go back as my first choice.The breakfast is also very good.

1,907,Oct 15 2009 	Perfect family accommodation in London	This is a lovely establishment which is located conveniently for travel. The staff offer a personalised service to each guest and we received great care. Felt like being at home without having to do anything! I would advise those travelling for businessor leisure (with or without a family) to consider The Langorf. The manager is an exceptional lady who always aims for excellent customer service. Great value for money in the Hampstead area.
2,907,"Sep 29 2009 	Great hotel	The Langorf Hotel is a very nice hotel in a quiet area but still very central only a five minutes walk from the nearest subway. the rooms a very nice you can get rooms facing a beatiful garden, and they offer wi-fi in every room if you bring your laptop. if you dont have a laptop with you it is not a problem because there is internet acces in the hotel. the staff is very kind they allways greet you with a big smile and are ready to help in every situations. the breakfeast is exellent and it is served in very warm surroundings. so a very nice hotel which i definitely will visit again."
3,907,"Sep 26 2009 	Nice residential location	We've stayed three times in this hotel. Main reason being the location in recidental area in a not touristy district still providing easy access to centre and also to the Wembley events. It is an adequate tourist class hotel but the interior decoration is shabby and out-dated. Compared to other London tourist class hotels the rooms are bigger. The cleaniness is ok but not excellent. Breakfast consists of rolls, croissants, toasts, cheese, ham, eggs, cereals, yoghurt, tea, coffee, juice and fruit salads. Simple, tasty and fresh. No lettuce or any other vedgetables.They seem not have any customer registry as each time the room we have recieved has been worse. This time we got room 408 which was smallest so far and next to the elevator. The insulation is poor. We could in the first night hear the love noise from room next door luckily they left and a couple with a child stayed there instead. They have a computer in the lobby but the access to internet is not provided for free. This is so unusual nowadays that they should rethink the policy. Recommend to walk uphill to Hampstead for village kind of athmosphere: nice walks, shopping (little stores) and eating in restaurants. We've twice eated in Silva's portugese restaurant on Heath Street. Tasty food from fresh ingredients with excellent portugese wine and superb"
4,907,"Sep 19 2009 	A little over-priced but we've stayed in much worse!	Our stay was generally a favourable experience, which we would be likely to repeat in the future. Staff members were friendly and helpful and provided everything we needed, including continental breakfast. The hotel is near 2 tube stations, a 24-hour Sainsbury's, a cinema, pubs and lots of restaurants, so it's convenient for most things. The hotel does not have its own car park, but it is possible to use the car park for the O2 shopping centre across the road at a cost of 10.50 for the duration of your stay. It's also very quiet, as it is located on a back street just off Finchley Road.On the down-side, the rooms are quite small and our room had a rotten window-frame with a broken catch, which leaked when it rained and you could see daylight through the wood at the bottom. Also, our tea and coffee supplies weren't replenished every day, so we had to ask for more.On the whole though, it was quite a good hotel that was an ideal base for discovering London!"
5,907,"Jul 23 2009 	Reservation and billing problems	My wife and I have stayed twice at Langorf hotel. The location is convenient for places we go in North London, and the rooms - though basic - have met our needs. Unlike some other reviewers, I've found their reception staff friendly and helpful.Beware of problems with their reservation and billing systems. I booked the room through the hotel's own website, but when we arrived they had no record of our reservation. Fortunately they still had space for us, but some other travelers with reservations for longer stays were being turned away. The staff was aware that the on-line bookings didn't always reach the hotel, but obviously they'd not solved the problem.A month after our stay, I received a credit card statement billing me a second time for the same stay. The hotel didn't respond to my inquiry, and I've had to ask American Express to resolve this."
6,907,"Jul 15 2009 	good value -- within reason	By the standards of London prices, this is a reasonable hotel to stay in. However, our room was small and a bit shabby (e.g., bits of wallpaper had been torn off the wall -- why?), but the bathroom -- fairly large and certainly modern -- made up for this. Breakfast was quite ample, and included in the price. The staff were certainly friendly -- but a bit clueless (forgetting taxi orders, newspapers, etc.) On the other hand, the location is within easy walking distance of the Finchley Road station on the Jubilee Line, and a long uphill walk to Hampstead High Street --through a quiet residential area. Be warned, howecer, that there is no air conditioning, and on a hot humid London day, the [small] room can get pretty stuffy."
7,907,"Jul 8 2009 	Nice place to stay	If you plan a week end in Hampstead, this is the place to stay !"
8,907,"Jul 8 2009 	Decent place for an extended stay	My family went to London and Paris for a total of 12 days in 2007. We were on our own personal sightseeing death march.We booked an apartment at the Langorf which we used for 4 days, left for 5 and returned to for another 3 after we returned from Paris.The apartment had two bedrooms, a couple sleeper sofas and a dining table for 6. There was a bathroom (actually pretty nice). There was a small kitchen with a full sized fridge, stove with oven, microwave and the requisite pots and pans. There was even a washing machine for clothes. [No dryer... but there was a drying rack]The Langorf is close to a supermarket... near the scale of a suburban American market, so food was easy to get and there was plenty of choices.The hotel let us check our extra luggage while we were in Paris... at no charge if I remember correctly."
9,907,"Jun 4 2009 	Unexpectedly good value	I used to think that all budget hotels in London are nearly the same. You are getting a small room to indulge your claustrophobia (the tiniest one was in Cardiff Hotel near Paddington Station) a very spare breakfast and that be all. Well, Langorf is way better although room price is not exactly bottom-low. Outwards it looks like all of them - a red brick house on a side street near Finchley Road tube station. The area is nothing to write home about (I was hoping it'd be within reasonable distance to Hampstead Heath, but no). The lobby is tiny and crowded but my room (basement) was surprisingly big and comfortable. It was quite and I felt myself at peace after a busy day.You can get your breakfast in the morning, it is Contintental but somewhat above the bare milk, toast and cereal variety. To sum up: - it is near a tube station (though not exactly close to the center, train runs just one stop from Baker Street, but it's rather a long one)- it is near a high street where you can find shops and entertainment if you want. There is even a Russian deli.- it is clean and comfortable and the reception (thank you, Monica) was friendly and helpful.Not too bad for London, really."
10,907,"May 27 2009 	The apartment is lacking some essentials.	The Langorf is on the outskirts of London in a working class neighborhood. We spent a week in one of the apartments. When we entered, we immediately noticed a musty smell, but we were initially impressed with the roomy living room. We found the beds to be clean but with hard mattresses, and there were only 3 hangers in each of the two closets. The TV had 6 local channels, and we were surprised to see that the only US channel was The Bloomberg Channel with lots of financial news but not much else. Our biggest disappointment was in the kitchen which was lacking in what we consider some basic essentials such as plates, drinking glasses, and hand towels. So, we made our first trip from the apartment to the local Sainsbury's store and bought paper plates, drinking cups, dish soap, paper towels, a cork screw, and a new electric kettle as the one in the apartment looked very old and dirty. There is no microwave, and the fridge is small. The wireless Internet access worked well once we got the correct password from the front desk, but it cost one British Pound per hour to use. The daily maid service was a nice feature with fresh towels, but we were led to believe that breakfast was included with the price of the apartment, but it was not. The guests in the apartment above us came home late and were very noisy. The apartment is a short walk from the Finchley Road subway, and the charming village of Hampstead is just up the road. The apartment did not meet our expectations, and we wished we had found a better place to stay for a week. The price of the apartment was also 10 British Pounds a day higher than what was quoted over the Internet."
11,907,"Apr 17 2009 	A hotel in need of a makeover.	Location is the best thing about the hotel. It is 5-6 minutes from the tube and has a good supermarket and local shops close by.The breakfast selection is limited and i advise you to get to the breakfast room early as when some food stuffs run out, such as eggs, the kitchen staff would not cook any others. In fact, the kitchen staff were particularly unhelpful and spoiled what would have been a good visit.The hotel had no ice, as the ice machine was supposedly broken, and when we asked for an ice bucket we were given a china bowl! Not the best or elegant thing to put your wife's birthday champagne in!The decor and condition of the room we stayed in was somewhat dated and tired, in need of a little refurbishment and modernising.The front desk staff were friendly and helpful.Despite the criticisms the price of the room was very reasonable and its location was handy for travelling in and around London."
12,907,"Apr 1 2009 	A charming and friendly hotel	I'd recommend this hotel to anyone on a business or pleasure trip who wants to stay somewhere quiet, on a reasonable budget (for London), within easy reach of central London. The reception staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, and seemed to really enjoy serving people. My double room was charmingly decorated and very cosy - although as a single traveller I must say that it would have been a squeeze for two people with luggage. However the staff had made it ready for me for early check-in; had I arrived later I probably would have been given a larger room - there were many. But for one person it was perfect.The hotel is in a very attractive and quiet road, 5 mins' walk from Finchley Road underground station, which is only half a dozen stops away from Oxford St and other central London attractions.I stayed there for two nights and I really didn't want to leave! The only downside is that the hotel doesn't serve a cooked English breakfast, but the continental one isn't bad at all."
13,907,Apr 1 2009 	A very pleasent stay.	A small clean and quite hotel in a good area. we will come again.Nili and Dorith from Israel
14,907,"Mar 9 2009 	Would stay there again	Just spent one night in the hotel while visiting a relative in London. The location, as other guests have stated, was perfect for Hampstead Heath and the tube into the city. The room was more than adequate, clean and comfortable for a couple of nights and it was a change from chain hotels with long corridors. The bathroom was not huge, but larger than many and had a very efficient heater and hooks on the back of the door! It was generally very clean, but the shower surround had seen better days and let it down a little. However, the shower itself was very effective and there was plenty of hot water. Unfortunately we stayed when there were howling gales and the window did rattle until we wedged it with a serviette! Problem solved.Breakfast was more than sufficient and there was a large choice of cereals, fruit, breads, pastries, meats and cheeses. We arrived for breakfast around 8.45 on the Sunday and there was plenty of space. We did not feel hurried in any way, because on that particular morning there were no queues.We found the staff very friendly, professional and helpful and could not fault them at all. Particularly at breakfast time, they went out of their way to please. Having stayed in numerous hotels throughout the British Isles, I have to admit this is one of the better experiences."
15,907,"Mar 4 2009 	Farcically bad service: avoid like the plague	I don't think I have ever encountered such bad service at a hotel. I did wonder if I'd wondered onto the set of Fawlty Towers. I stayed at the Langorf for one night with 2 friends, one of whom was getting married at Kenwood House the next day. The staff treated us like an inconvenience throughout our stay. On arrival at the main reception, laden with bags and luggage, a staff member glanced up, told me my apartment was up the road and left. I wondered down the street lost and unable to locate the place and had to ring my friend to find out where to go. Would it have been too much trouble to walk me to my room, maybe grab one of my bags while you're at it? There was insufficient linen in the room and the hotel wouldnt supply more. I slept on a matress with a blanket and no sheets. There were 2 towels to share between 3 guests.There was no hairdryer in the room. I rang reception to request one. A staff member knocked on our door - not to bring a hairdryer but to search our cupboards to check that there wasn't a hairdryer before sending someone else round with one. I mean - why would we make up the fact that there wasnt one?Staf at the main desk couldn't speak enough English to understand me when I went to ask for a safety pin.The final insult? We had agreed on booking that we would check out at one, rather than 12, as my friend was getting married at 1.30 pm. On the morning of the wedding, staff asked us to leave at 12 o clock - even though there were no guests moving into our room - they wanted the bride to wait in the road for an hour on the morning of her wedding so they could clean the room. My friend who was nervous anyway was nearly in tears. We basically refused to leave until the preplanned time but they were not happy about it.I imagine they are this rude because there are not many hotels in Hamspead so there is no competition. Avoid like the plague."
16,907,"Feb 25 2009 	Perfect location	This hotel is perfectly located in a residential street just a 10 minute walk from Hampstead High Street and tube and 5 minutes from Finchley Road tube. We were going to an engagement party in London on Valentines and only booked this hotel a week before. We got an excellent online rate, 75 B &amp; B with a bottle of wine. When we checked in we were upgraded to a one bedroomed flat. The hotel is actually 3 town houses next door to each other and the flat was in the end house. It was very clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is continental buffet style and there was plenty of choice, cold meats, cheeses, eggs, fruit, pastries etc. Only one negative on our stay, breakfast was very busy and we had to wiat 10 minutes for a table, that said, it shows the hotel is popular. The hotel has a bar and the reception is a comfortable place to read the dailies. I would recommend highly for a city break trip to London, excellent value if you want to stay centrally without getting ripped off."
17,907,"Oct 28 2008 	helpfull staff	We had an enjoyable one night stay to see a show.Although the room was small, it was clean and adequate.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and all were very friendly. The position is close to the tube and parking at a nearby supermarket is convenient ( 10.50). Breakfast was good and served till 9.30. We would certainly return."
18,907,"Aug 11 2008 	Pleasant Hotel	We stayed at the Langorf for 3 nights in the two bedroom apartment. Requested the ground floor apartment because of experience in other Euro hotels not having lifts (elevators). Little did we know ground floor is below street level. However the accomodations were clean, tidy and freshly painted. Staff we encountered were very pleasant, informative and accomodating. Area is easily accesible to Finchley road tube and other amenities in the Finchley Road area. Continental breakfast in the morning is more than suffice to get your day started. Only negative comments were inconsiderate guests in above apt, who stomped across the floor very early in the morning and late at night and guests who chose to smoke outside hotel and toss cigarette butts over wall onto steps leading to apt. although these minor issues would not deter us from going back"
19,907,"Jun 29 2008 	Quiet and Homey But Near Everything You Need	More charm than a chain hotel, with decent furnishings and clean bathrooms. We stayed in a room on the third floor that fronted the hotel and slept with our window open every night. No bugs and amazingly, in London, no noise. The street is as quiet as a suburban road in the U.S. Our three kids shared a room down in the ground level, with a bow window facing the garden. We didn't spend a lot of time hanging out in our rooms, as we were in London to &quot;see and do.&quot; For three nights, the accommodations were perfect. Longer, and with more time in the room, it would have felt too cramped. The location is ideal, with Hampstead up the hill, and Finchley Road downhill. We caught the Metro at Finchley, a five minute walk to from the Langorf. We ate a couple meals at the &quot;O2 Centre&quot; (mall) down on Finchley Road, and could buy anything we needed, fruit, nuts, snacks, from Tesco, located there. We really liked Nandos, the Argentinian restaurant at the O2, even though it is a chain. Wheat, a restaurant up at Hempstead, was a pleasant surprise."
20,907,"Jun 11 2008 	Fourth Stay - Same Fun Family Stay	This was our fourth stay at the Langorf and we still enjoy the place. We have stayed in their apartments as well as hotel rooms. Its clean and maybe a little worn but it has character and a nice way about it. We are not the type to use room service and do not expect amenities here. Normally, we would buy our own goodies and use the dining room for some snacking. On this last trip, we went downstairs to the bar area and ordered some wine and cheese. Frankly, the individual behind the desk fell over himself trying to accommodate us and we were surprised with the quality of our cheese plate. We would have expected something very ordinary because we don't use this hotel other than a base of operations to be near some London-based family members. We were a group of five this time and became larger when family visited. Its relaxed environment allows us to bring in our wine and sit in the dining area to the early morning hours talking and laughing without feeling that we are bothering anyone.It seems to have new management or ownership. I'm not sure which but the front desk people were helpful and friendly. I'm sorry to hear that some people did not like their visits. For some reason, I'm not surprised about some conditions but feel they would be addressed if brought to management's attention. In any event, its a great value. We have stayed at other locations in this neighborhood but continue to go back to the Langorf."
21,907,"May 23 2008	Grotty little hole	How can anyone in their right mind think it is acceptable to give guests a bedspread with obvious bloodstains on it? Add to that an unfixed broken window, a filthy carpet which looked like it hadn't been cleaned or replaced in twenty years, a broken toilet seat and extremely dated decor. I am amazed this place has had such good reviews off others - was I spectacularly unlucky in the room I was allotted? In my opinion, hotels which show this kind of contempt towards their guests deserve to go out of business. Only stay here if you are desperate."
22,907,"Apr 22 2008 	excellent servicehigh standard	From the first approach till check out I had a very positive opinion about the Hotel.reception is well organised,helpful,kind,rooms are absolutely spotless,nicely refurbished.We had a quite spacious room comparing to other hotel rooms in London.The location is perfect,10 minutes from centre,but still nice residental area.I recommend it to all who are planning to travel to London,and wants to get a high standard for their money."
23,907,"Apr 18 2008 	Good value for money	Staff really friendly, clean and cute room and good position of the hotel. Lovely, terrific."
24,907,"Apr 5 2008 	Gone downhill	This was my third stay at the Langorf in the last 3 years. I must say that although it is still good value for money, it desperately needs to be refurbished! The chair in the room had a few nasty stains on it and the wallpaper was peeling off in the corners. Never the less, the room was clean and comfortable. The lift was out of order in the morning. The service also has got worse and when I asked for an ironing board for the room I was told they did not have time to deliver it so I would need to collect it from the reception. I wouldn't mind if this was said in a polite manner but the receptionist seemed very rude. However the other staff seemed friendly and when we got back from a gig in the evening it was nice to be able to have a few drinks in the hotel bar. A word of warning: if you want a late night snack, go elsewhere as they can only provide what can be only described as toast made out of 'value' bread with some 'plastic' cheese and tomatoe!! I stay in Finchley Road area quite often and this is still the best value hotel in the area so I will probably stay again."
25,907,"Mar 11 2008	Well above average	I found this an excellent small hotel of its type - independent, unpretentious, quiet and comfortable. The room I stayed in was just fine, clean and spacious. Nothing showy about it, but for the price that's all I wanted. Breakfast was good enough and served by friendly staff. A couple of tips: there is a good public pool in Swiss Cottage, 15 minutes walk away, and excellent shopping on Finchley Road. The tube at Finchley Road can take you to concert halls, shopping &amp; museums in 10/15 minutes, or there is the overground train from Finchley Road &amp; Frognal which can take you around the city from Richmond at one end to Stratford at the other. I can't explain the comments of the person who hated the apartments - I didnt see those - but for a clean safe overnight stay, especially if you want to be out of the centre of the city, this is definitely recommended."
26,907,"Mar 8 2008 	who took the photos for the web site?	I have just stayed at this hotel...langorf, we had an appartment...which was described as two bedroom...top floor 5 flights of stairs, no lift , one of the rooms was 'a shoe box' with a tiny single bed in the eaves you could not sit up in it..the tiny kitchen was absolutely filthy....the sink did not work in the bathroom and the grime around the walls, shower and sink was a disgrace, it was the same for the all the rooms. there was nothing goodfor this the fee was 170 per night. the web site is very clever!!!!I have never in all my life stayed some where so bad...needless to say we checked out early curtailing our stay in london.not recommended."
27,907,"Feb 12 2008 	Great Stay	Great Stay! We reserved on-line and were happy to see that our reservation had been received by the hotel. Location is great (no more than 5 minutes to the tube) and out of the more expensive core of London. Friendly staff, delicious breakfast, clean rooms and bathrooms. Internet access for 1pound (=20 minutes). 24HR front desk, and 24HR Pizza parlour down the street for those suffering from jet lag. :)Our room could have been considered slightly small if travelling with a lot of luggage, but friend's room was spacious. Stayed 3 nights, and would definetely go back. (our only concern was the security - you must leave your room key at the front desk. (unusual for NA hotels). No problems though - had a great experience, although I would not leave valuables in the room)."
28,907,"Feb 9 2008 	Langorf has the friendliest staff	I stayed at the Langorf for 2 days. I chose it for the proximity to the Royal Free Hospital which I was visiting. Room was not large - but clean and welcoming.The staff were so friendly and fulfilled all my requests with a smile. I found out once I was there that the o2 centre with some reasonable choices for family restaurants was a bonus. If you are flying, the Luton and Stanstead express buses pass by on the Finchley Road"
29,907,"Nov 8 2007 	Great Hotel lovely staff	Great place, great location great staff.This is not one of those hotel chain where everything looks the same regardless the country you are visiting. This hotel has its own character and is unique. The staff is very friendly, professional and always available.I have been coming to the the Langorf on a regular basis for the last two years and I higly recommend it."
30,907,"Sep 30 2007 	Good hotel	We enjoyed our stay at the Langorf - it was well located and a good price. The breakfast, considering it was a 'continental' buffet was also very good and the staff were friendly. The room was fairly small, but it was quiet and comfortable. Our main complaint would be were that we were denied breakfast after 9.30 on a Bank Holiday Monday, despite it being advertised until 10.00 on weekends and holidays. I would definitely stay here again."
31,907,"Jan 22 2007 	An Okay Stay	Arrived at 6 p.m. on a Saturday and luckily found street parking right outside. First impressions from the outside were good. Reception is small and a bit dowdy, but my wife &amp; I were booked in quickly and efficiently. The room and facilities were basic, but it was clean and resonably comfortable. I slept well although my wife was kept awake by a noisy party across the road, but I can't blame the hotel for that! The continental breakfast choice was good. Staff were friendly &amp; efficient. So for a one night stay we were happy with our choice for the rate we paid. We'd go back again. A reasonable hotel at a reasonable price."
32,907,"Nov 19 2006	Let Down by Poor Service	Wanting to stay in North London, in a good quality hotel, we were attracted by both the Tripadvisor reviews and the hotel's own website, appearing to depict a hotel that was striving to provide a professional and reliable service.Although initially reassured, on arrival, by the good location and pleasant reception, on entering our first room, we were confronted by an umade bed, a dirty ashtray and an uncleaned bathroom.Mistakes happen, so we were pleased to be promptly offered a new room, which was fine, even though for the price the worn curtains and battered side table were a bit dispiriting.We would have left the Langorf with a relatively positive impression, had it not been for the what lay in store when we went down to breakfast. Arriving at the breakfast room at five minutes to ten on Sunday, having been told breakfast was available until ten, we were abruptly and dismissively told we were too late and that the kitchen was closed as they needed to prepare for a conference. We were disappointed not to be able to get breakfast, as this was a consideration in deciding whether the hotel was a good deal. However, it was the way in which the hotel staff appeared totally unconcerned by our predicament, making it quite clear that preparation for a conference was far more important to them than treating their guests with civility, that really upset us. On explaining how we felt, the reply was that as the manager would not be in till Monday, there was nothing that could be done.We left the hotel very disappointed; for somehere that is aspiring to be a notch above a standard local hotel, it needs to pay far more attention to providing its guests with basic good service and consideration."
33,907,"Oct 31 2006 	Good Accomodation just out of the centre of expensive London	Our family of four, stayed for 5 nights in an apartment, remember that London is one of the most expensive places to get accomodation, so just 10mins on their wonderful tube system, and a 5 min walk ,made the GBP$150 per night an affordable option. We had breakfast once and at GBP$13 per person, considered other budget options, the apartment was fully equipt with stove, toaster and kettle, so getting your own supplies from the corner store reduced the cost considerably. The apartment was located on the top floor of three with NO lift and a very narrow staircase, so our numerous heavy bags provided quite a workout, I would not recommend the apartment to someone who is physically challanged. Close by is a supermarket , numerous takeaway stores ( pizza, chinese and hamburger), 7-eleven type store and a couple of pubs"
34,907,"Sep 24 2006 	Good for families	My wife and I stayed with our 9 month old daughter for a week. As the hotel was busy we stayed in both a 1 bedroom apartment and a studio apartment as we couldn't book the full week in either. The staff were helpful and polite, the rooms were very clean and tidy. The 1 bed apt could have done with renovation as was looking a bit dated, but as said was clean, tidy and comfortable. The studio was much more modern, and having seen both rooms would book the studio over the 1 bed apt. Staying with a young child, it was a bonus to have a proper kitchen in both rooms, as it made eating a lot easier as well as dealing with the baby bottles, and both rooms had clothes washer/driers. Baby bed and high chair were provided. My only small complaint is that I was told there was a wireless LAN available, however this wasn't the case. There is internet access available, but you have to go to reception and plug in a LAN cable. Overall I would say that the Langorf is good value for money, good for families and is in a good location to for public transport. Would stay there again. By the way a black cab driver told me that the name of the hotel comes from the street it's in. Frognal spelt backwards!"
35,907,Jul 25 2006 	Quite a gem	My wife and I stayed for just one Friday night in July. For the price we found the hotel to be clean &amp; quiet and in a beautiful position. 5 minutes walk from Hampstead village. A 4 bedroom house backing onto the hotel was on the market for 2.2 million! The hotel is meant to be simple and we hate paying for facilities that we won't use. We would go back to the Langorf anytime. Can't understand the whingeing reviews. Glad I don't know the girl who couldn't get into a Hilton.
36,907,"Apr 12 2006	Ideal Location	Stayed with 4 friends in one of the Langorf apartments for a week. The location was ideal for us - 5min walk to the tube, and so many facilities on our doorstep - pubs, sainsburys, restaurants &amp; take-aways. We had a ground floor apartment, and the shower broke on the 1st day, but they fixed it promptly. The kitchen was well serviced, like a home away from home. The rooms were clean and well-sized, though perhaps could do with a bit of a face-lift. Ideal for a group of young friends sharing I'd say."
37,907,"Apr 7 2006	OK	Hotel was pleasant in nice area within easy walk of Underground. There were good restaurants, groceries, and a nice shopping center within a block. Rooms were a bit small and beds were not comfortable."
38,907,"Dec 10 2005 	Never again	I currently travel to London on a weekly basis and the company I work for normally book me into Hilton/Holiday Inn/Novotel etc. However this particular day London was very busy and the hotel agency could only offer the Langorf Hotel. I looked at their website and tripadvisor and thought it looks ok - it was only for one night. What a mistake!! When I arrived at the hotel I checked in and went to my room which was chinzy but clean, however there was an awful banging noise coming from somewhere so I went to reception and was told it was the boiler which was faulty and suggested I turned the radiator knob down as this might stop it - it didn't. Whilst I was at reception I enquired about an evening meal - the receptionist said they really don't do meals but took me to the kitchen and offered to make me a cheese toastie!! being a female on my own I was very reluctant to find somewhere to eat so I accepted her offer. Could it get any worse?? I was awoken at 1.00am by someone hanging around outside my bedroom door. I phoned reception who came and I heard them ask this man to move and get out!!.After trying to get back to sleep I was then woken by the banging of the boiler again at 5.00am - at this point I decided to get up. I was going to have their continental breakfast but it didn't start til 7.30am so I asked for the bill and went to work early. I would not recommend this hotel."
39,907,Nov 9 2005 	Very pleasant stay	A nice clean friendly hotel. Breakfast very basic but this is reflected in the excellent price for B&amp;B.The last review was a bit harsh. All the staff seemed friendly and the main noise came from emergency sirens in the nearby Finchley Road.A good position for public transport. On street parking not so good.If you prefer a chain type hotel this is probably not for you. Owners have recently aquired a bar licence and there is 24 hour room service.All in all a lovely hotel.

41,907,"Dec 26 2004	Great!	Excellent value, very &quot;british&quot; ... A very warm welcome too and nice breakfast!But avoid coming with your car as the parking is very expensive..."
42,907,"Sep 29 2004	A quiet retreat	We stayed at Langorf Hotel in Hampstead which is 5 miles from the centre of London close to major train stations. It is a wonderful area full of majestic old homes and the renowed Hampstead Heath which could be explored for days. The apartment was very comfortable and quiet and still only a bus trip or tube ride to all the major attractions. Hampstead is very cosmopolitan and stylish with many restaurants and galleries as well as well stocked supermarkets. It was a great choice with children as we had more flexibility in planning meals. The only criticism was that the small kitchen did not have a microwave. If carrying heavy luggage, make sure you ask for an apartment on a lower floor. Breakfasts were great and are usually extra but you might be able to negotiate it in the price of the apartment. Our apartment was 150 Sterling per night for 2 bedrooms which was very good value compared to other London accomodation."
43,907,"Aug 3 2004	typical english country house in london	I really liked my stay at the Langorf. The hotel is in a quiet street off busy Finchley Road.There you have great public transport (still in the cheap tube zone 2- off peak travelcard available)via two tube lines and several buses (incl. night buses ) to the West End or City or even a train station (Finchley Rd and Frognal)with direct trains to beautiful Richmond on Thames and Kew Botanical Gardens. Oxford Street (Bond Street Tube stop) just 3 tube stops away. A big advantage is the bus stop for the coaches from Luton and Stanstead Airport right around the corner, 5 min walk.. This means you do not have to go to Central London from the airport to get to your hotel (heavy traffic) which saves you time.The room was nicely furnished and really quiet. Breakfast was served in a really nice breakfast room with view into the back garden. You really felt like in a country house and not in the bustling capital city. It is a nice walk to Hampstead village, one of the nicest parts of London and there are lots of shops, supermarkets and places to eat around Finchley Rd. tube station.Probably my favourite place to stay in London in this star rating category and I go to London regulary and used to live there."
44,907,"Mar 8 2004	Small and Welcoming Hotel	I've stayed here three times on various visits to London and have always had a wonderful experience. The Frognal is a quiet and charming hotel that looks and feels more expensive than it is, both on the inside and out. The morning breakfast buffet is abundant and fresh. Both the bathrooms and the room itself are very clean. The only downside is that it's near the St. Johns Wood tube stop which you can see on a tube map is a bit of a ride from most tourist attractions in central London. You won't exactly be in the center of the action, but you will be in a quiet and charming neighborhood."
45,907,"Jan 21 2003	Great bargain	Whenever I travel to London, I always stay at the Langorf Hotel because it is a very nice hotel, close to a tube stop, and in a quiet neighborhood. The rooms are bright and comfortable and the staff is very helpful. It feels like a much pricier hotel than what it costs to stay there. There are also very nice restaurants within walking distance."

2,910,"Nov 6 2009 	A Charming Hotel	I stayed here in September 2009 for one night. I only needed one night because I was traveling as a student and I could not move into my dorm until the very next day. I was a bit worried since I was not used to the hotel quality in the UK. When I arrived it was about 10pm. I was buzzed in by the receptionist. She was very helpful especially since I was carrying a backpack and 2 pieces of luggage. She led me to their Annex building across the street and a few buildings down. I was afraid to see what I got myself into, but to my suprise, I found a very charming and clean room. The room had a gigantic bed with lovely curtains. The room was complete with a flat screen tv which includes cable, a playstation 3, and free wifi internet. Just make sure you let the receptionist know that you want to use the free wifi so she can give you the password. The showers were remarkable, it was more like a wet room with marble floors and newly renovated shower walls. The toilet and sink was located in another part of the room. The room comes complete with amenities such as cookies, figs, drinking glasses, knives, soft drinks and soda. But keep in mind if you eat or drink any of it you will pay a reasonable price. I loved the free continental breakfast. They deliver it right to your room. Breakfast includes, orange juice, pastries, toast, coffee and milk, cereal and jam. I dont know why some of the reviewers on this site gave it such a bad review but perhaps they just had some misfortunes during their stay. I highly recommend this hotel especially since its in central london. The value for this hotel is superb. If you want to stay in a 4 star hotel, expect to spend half of your savings especially since this is central london. The more central in London you are the more expensive it is. The hotel is convienently located a short 7 min walk to Baker Street station which is the a hub for most of London's underground lines. The hotel was a bit noisy in the morning primarily because most of the residents were getting up to check out or what not. The receptionist was very helpful in calling a cab so it can take to the college grounds. One word of advice though, if you are arriving into central london from Heathrow airport, avoid taking a cab. You are looking at spending about 80 - 140 pounds due to the fact that the cab drivers charge you with the meter. They keep charging you even if you are at a stop or stuck in traffic. And central london is very congested during the day. So to avoid that problem, take the Heathrow express tube line to paddington. Then switch to the Bakerloo line to Baker Street."
3,910,"Oct 12 2009 	Do Not Stay Here!!!	My Husband and I visited London on our Honeymoon this past September. When we booked our hotel stay with La Suite back in March, there were great reviews everywhere, but the night before we left, we were looking online and saw some pretty awful ones posted recently. Seeing as how it was too late to do anything now, we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they would be awesome...not the case. When we got there, they were over booked and so they started calling all their current guests to see when they would be checking out because they needed the room. We were asked to wait, which we did. While we were waiting, several more groups came in to check in and you could see panic start behind the counter.After about 30 mins, we were told our room would be across the street at the &quot;Annex&quot;. This is what we had read bad reviews on, so we asked to see the room before we signed anything. They escorted us and our bags across the street and down a few buildings to an apartment building that they had redone a few rooms in for the hotel. Our room was on the first floor facing the street. (We had nice privacy curtains, but it was still very noisy). The hotel staff showed us the &quot;amenities&quot; of the room and left. After discussing it, we walked back over and asked to see the room we had booked. Mind you, we hadn't seen anything that resembled a picture we saw online yet! They assured us that the room we were in was the nicest they had to offer and was a substantial upgrade from the room we booked online. They showed us a tiny room, tucked under the stairs with no bathroom and told us that was what we had booked. We decided to stay in our room. The stay continued to get worse. The fire alarms went off 3 times one morning with nothing so much as an apology or even a courteous call to say they were working on it and to disregard. The walls were so thin you could EVERYTHING going on in the entire building. The hotel staff didn't speak hardly any English (strange for England) and was less than enthusiastic to help with directions or maps of any kind. We never received clean bed linens the entire 5 day trip. But sadly, this was not the worst of it. On the first morning, I was in the shower and was mildly electrocuted by a current under the shower. When I touched a towel that had gotten wet and was sitting in the corner, I got a small shock that went up my arm. Then I realized the entire edge of the tub was carrying the same current. I reported it to the front desk and requested they send someone to check it out immediately and was told that it was only static electricity and that it wasn't harmful! This is absolutely unacceptable!Please listen to all the people who have recommended staying elsewhere if you still have time to make other arrangements. This is not a 4 star hotel, much less a 2 star hotel. It is cheap; the service is awful, and it is not clean."
4,910,"Oct 8 2009 	What a Pity!	We spent a Weekend at the la Suite Hotel in September. The location is great, walking distance about minutes to M. Tussauds and Baker Street station ( 3 stations to Paddington from where Heathrow Express departs ). As it is in a side street is is rather quiet. Close by are Oxford and Regent Street where you can do all your shopping.The hotel itself is eqipped very modern and stylish, flatscreen tv and bose sound system. The Hempel duplex suite is very stylish, too but also very small! And the idea of serving breakfast in a basket in your room is very niceWhat disappointed us that much is the fact that theres a hugh lack of cleanliness. We had 2 rooms, both werent clean. Mold in bathroom, fingerprints on the closet, the dinnerware and cutlery havent been washed in a dishwasher as they were still crusts of msli and other residues. Even the bowls served with the breakfast were crusted, the cutlery had wiping marks and the glasses were about the same.We did not use the computer in the room when we saw the keyboard, it was disgusting. It is really a pity as otherwise it would almost be a 5* hotel. Houekeeping is less than 1*.The staff at front desk is very friendly and helpful."
5,910,"Sep 7 2009 	La Suite - Small.....but Chic!	I stayed here for 4 nights in a Deluxe one bed suite, on the top floor of their building across the road (expansion in business). It was extremely small, you would not manage to fit on the loo if you were, can I say, overly on the generous side as the bathroom is so cramped. You'd get stuck between wall and bath, seriously. However, beautifully designed and if you get the right price, its a fabulous spot round the corner from Marylebone High Street. A decent sized and good quality buffet breakfast is brought to your room but obviously it lacks space to eat if you are in 3 (I bought my two older kids, there was a sofa bed) but it would be fine if you are just 2. The staff are helpful and uncomplaining as they trudged up and down stairs which brings me to a negative....the lift was out of order for most the week and we were on the top floor. I don't mind a bit of exercise but sometimes I came in 4 or 5 times a day. The staff I believe tried hard to get this sorted and gave me small discount as a goodwill gesture. Overall, I am not complaining at all. I would definitely stay here again but of course, if you want a full-on deluxe hotel experience with all the frills then this is not for you. Having said that they sorted me some tickets, kept my luggage, had a nice coffee machine in reception and kept the place very clean. Eva the manager was always around and I would recommend this aparthotel."
6,910,"Aug 1 2009 	Get the right room	My bf and I booked for a studio suite for 9 nights. We were given a really small room across the street (I think it's the so-called La Suite Next Door Hotel ?), literally had to step out of the bathtub onto the bed to dry ourselves. Completely different to what was shown on their website. If I were traveling alone for a short period of time, I wouldn't mind staying in that small room since the room was afterall well equipped, with Sony TV, playstation, laptop (gotta rent from the staff), rainshower, Elemis bath products etc. But we were there for 9 nights and after enquiring, they moved us back to the main building with a much bigger room just as shown on their website. After that, everything was excellent. Computer and free internet worked fine, bed was very comfortable, breakfast was delivered ontime, and microwave and DVD machine available (though we didn't use them). There were two occasions where we requested for tea for breakfast but they gave us coffee, but those were just minor issues. Overall, the hotel is good."
7,910,"Aug 1 2009 	Lovely hotel shame they didnt keep their promises!	My husband and I visited La Suite Hotel for our first wedding anniversary in July 2009. The hotel was just as depicted on their website. The room was small - as is to be expected of a central London hotel, but they have made very good use of the space they have. The rooms are clean and well presented with modern decor and good 'kitchenette' facilities.The continental breakfast in bed was a lovely touch. The location is also very good. A slow crawl to Baker Street tube station, Marylebone High Street, Oxford Street and Regents Park.I must clarify that the hotel is located in two separate addresses; both on Nottingham Place. The second premises is an expansion of the business and has recently undergone refurbishment (which may explain some of the confused reviews on here and other similar websites).There were builders outside our bedroom window on weekdays, but they were not in any way intrusive or noisey. We were out of our room for most of our stay anyway. Our air conditioning broke, but thankfully British summer was not to hot!The reason for my poor rating of the hotel is that they failed to fulfil their promises. I contacted them beforehand to request a personalised cake and flowers to surprise my husband on the anniversary of our wedding. They said that it would be fine but they would charge 15% for their services. The requested sponge cake emerged as being a cream cake once it had been cut open several days after having left the hotel; obviously the cream was rancid and the cake inedible. The cake had not been refrigerated by hotel staff (because sponge cakes - which we thought we had - shouldn't be refrigerated as it makes them hard) the night before in preparation for the morning it arrived and could not fit in the fridge in our room even if we had been told it was a cream cake. There were no labels to indicate. I contacted the hotel to challenge the fact that I had paid 86.74 for something that was not as it was described in our original contract. They refused to take responsibility and stated that I should contact the cake shop they had bought it from. They have not offered any copensation or an alternative. The manager has instructed staff to tell me that she has popped out / is taking a two week holiday. The childish behaviour from the manager has been appalling. The cake ordering may have been an innocent mistake made by a staff member (all of whom had Eastern European accents), so the hotel should have accepted responsibility."

I have been emailing regarding late departure and baggage holding room etc which was all agreed, with everything booked, we were all excitedly awaiting the day, when out of the blue on 17th June (9 days prior to our trip) I receive an email from La Suite saying they could no longer accommadate us, I was absolutely stunned at this, and couldn't believe that a hotel could treat a customer this way without giving any explanation what so ever! why would a hotel leave it that late to notify a customer especially as it was booked so far in advance, I think this was totally unacceptable and would worn any future customer to stear clear of them as I get the feeling this happens frequently.Tina West Surrey"
10,910,"May 6 2009 	Birthday Disaster	We arrived at the hotel to be told, rather accusingly, that we should have received an email. Apparently, there was a 'technical problem' (which was never explained) which meant that we would be moved elsewhere. We never received this email.This was made worse by the fact that it was my girlfriend's birthday, as we indicated when booked, and it did not seem that the hotel were particularly apologetic for essentially spoiling an expensive part of the trip. In fact, we did not receive any apology at all.We were moved to apartments relatively far away from any underground station in a (albeit free) transfer taxi. We were then told that we could, at our expense, go back for the 'complimentary' breakfast or eat at a nearby cafe (also at our own expense).The apartments we were moved to were below the standard expected, with many faults and unexplained key procedures, which we only had explained to us when we were locked out of the building. We would have declined the offer had it not been for the fact that we had booked to do other things during our stay.Overall, the hotel were unapologetic and we have been throughly dissuaded from staying in London again.We tried submitting this review on Expedia on our return home. It still has not been accepted!"
11,910,"Apr 16 2009 	Absolutely fabulous! Perfect in every way. bad reviews were a mix up with another hotel	I realized why this hotel mistakenly go a couple of bad reviews when our cabbie dropped us off one block down at a hotel called la place suites. When I checked the address I realized it was not la suites. LaSuites looks just like the pictures. The room was small but not by European or city standards. My husband and I and our 2 kids ages 7 and 13 stayed one night on our way down to Brighton) We had Suite #1 which has a bedroom with TV separated by a glass partition from the living room, which has another TV with video games and a large business desk with computer internet and printer/fax. The sofa turned into a small bed and our older child slept on the floor (the desk clerk gladly brought up a matress for her) The bath had a sauna steam shower but no tub. There was also a small kitchenette mini bar with complimentary teas/coffees and other snacks/drinks for purchase, some refrigerated. The hotel is very boutique and historic but with modern amenities. The breakfast was unbelievable! Youghurts, brie, stilton, and camembert cheeses, butter, bread, three types of jam/honey, a variety of gourtmet granola cerials, milk, coffee, fresh queezed orange juice,...and they brought four of everything (except the cheeses which were huge pieces). I have attached a photo of the food! Also in the gorgeous lobby is a complimentary cappucino machine which instantly makes mocha, cappucino, latte, espresso... teas, cookies, etc. The staff was so wonderful! They offered us a late checkout and the concierge booked us tickets for Madame T's which saved us hours in line. They also set up our cab and were so friendly and helpful. This was perfect for our family, great location and great value - booked online for 189 pounds with vat total 218. Unbelievable!"
12,910,"Nov 1 2008 	Misleading website	We have just spent a weekend in London and booked this hotel as it seemed reasonably priced and from the website looked very nice. On arrival there was ' a problem' with our room (which was never explained) and we had been booked into another hotel round the corner. Having no other choice we went to the other hotel (Durrants which was extremely nice). On returning the next day we were shown to our room and were extremely disappointed...we were right next to the reception at the bottom of the stairs, the room was tiny and the bathroom minute. There was no kitchenette as the website had suggested and a very small desk shoved against the window. The storage was inadequate and almost no hanging space. There was no mirror in the room so almost impossible to dry hair. The bathroom was marginally bigger than that of an aeroplane bathroom; there were no towel rails and we had to drape the towels over the shower screen. At every turn in the bathroom you banged into something. The one plus point was the breakfast and the speed of delivery however on the second morning only one breakfast was brought and when items that were missing were requested from the girl who had delivered it she replied ' I don't speak English'. There was no where to eat breakfast as implied on the website pictures and we had to sit on the bed. The air conditioning unit was very noisy but had to be kept on as the windows were sealed shut. This was most definately La Suite Hotel and not another hotel as suggested in previous reviews and maybe your stay is very dependent on the room you are given. My suggestion is that you should ask to see your room before you commit yourself. I cannot believe that this hotel describes itself as 'four star, luxurious, excecutive' I would suggest that it is more like a glorified hostel. Good luck to anyone that chooses to stay here despite reading this, but believe the bad reviews!"
13,910,"Mar 2 2008 	A real gem	Trying to find a hotel in London that's well located, comfortable and a sensible price isn't easy, but La Suite fills all the criteria.We arrive two hours early but the receptionist made us both a coffee and the room was made ready in 20 mins.A request of a hight floor was met and we were given a one bed studio on the 3rd floor (118). The room was a very good size with seperate kitchenette/sitting area and screened off bedroom. The bathroom is small but perfectly OK and that power shower is just fantastic!Location wise the hotel is in Marylebone village which has a real nice atmosphere, there are plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants withing just a few hundred yards.Baker St tube and buses are equally as close, although Oxford St can be reached by foot in 15 mins (Marylebone High St and just keep going straight on).Is there a down side? Not much, the lift is probably the smallest and slowest you will find and didn't quite go high enough to avoid a short flight of steps to our room, no problem at all for us, maybe so for some.There are a couple of reports on here giving the hotel one star, I just can't see how it can be the same hotel we just visited. However, we did walk into the reception of a similarly named hotel a few doors away which looked set in a 1950's time warp, could this explain anything? Anyway I can assure anyone that La Suite is just fine, certainly worth a return visit."
14,910,"Jan 8 2008 	Great location and nice accommodation	Nice place to stay with minimum fuss. Just spent 2 nights there and we liked the way you checked in and then were more or less left to your own devices. Our room was great - two TVs, a computer, docking station for I-Pod, nice little kitchen area with microwave, sink and fridge. Good location - handy for tube, restaurants and central London. Staff very helpful and pleasant. Towels a little threadbare, dressing gowns seen better days and power shower not very good, but excellent value for money and would certainly stay there again."
15,910,"Dec 7 2007 	Secret gem in London	First things first: The 2 reviews from 11/06 which give this hotel a 1 rating must be talking about a different hotel (or they have been delivered to the wrong place, or walked into one of the nearby hotels by accident) .. This place is very modern, with a touch of Japanese simplicity and beauty. The breakfast, while no big variety nor hot items, is of great quality (e.g. freshly pressed OJ) and is brought to your room (this way they saved space for a breakfast room, a coffee, tea, hot chocolate machine is available all day in the lounge)The rooms are small-ish, but that is to be expected in London, but they made the most of it, by even putting in glass dividers so that papa can still work at the desk, while mama and kid sleep undisturbed nearby. (The free internet is great, I did not use the terminal / pc thingie they also have in the rooms, i just switched the ethernet cable to my macbook and without any setup or passwords I was good to go). We also had a pull out couch, a 32&quot; flatt screen LCD, a DVD player and an iPod dock (how cool is that?) for our entertainment. Lots of overpriced mini bar items which we did not touch, there is a Tesco nearby (open until 11 PM) and a Waitrose down on Marylebone for essentials.Our room felt like we should have paid 50 GBP more per night.There are very few nitpicks we had: -The mattress was too soft (We heard later that in the UK the rule is 'the softer - the better'). -The very fancy hydro-shower is only as good as the water pressure you get ... I tried during different daytimes .. it was always fairly low. -The reception staff was very professional, but lacked knowledge about nearby eateries (but hey, for that you get the free internet connection)All in all we loved the stay, the location and we even got lucky with the weather ... and we surely would return. If you arrive in the evening and don't know where to go eat, down the street are a Greek and 2 Indian places. The Greek and the Bombay something were indeed very nice."
16,910,"Sep 15 2007 	One of best in London	One or two reviews scoring below 4 just cant be the right hotel. Honestly this is lovely hotel in a great area. Amazing value fab bathrooms and beds-avida toiletries, flat screen tv, kitchen. Its the best we have stayed in anywhere for the price (should be double!!!)If not sure and I really cant believe why or how the 1 score got on-maybe they had refit or something since that visit. Its always been spotless. Relax its great......"
17,910,"Sep 3 2007 	Nice place comfortable beds good location	I read the review (and saw the photos) of the person who stayed at about the same time my husband and I did (November 2006) and I think they have the wrong hotel! The first set of candid traveler photos (of a very nice room and bathroom) is what we experienced and we had a room in the basement! The breakfast is bland, but a not horrible and it's nice they include it. The bed was very comfortable and the hotel is in a great location."
18,910,"Aug 24 2007 	Absolutely perfect!	My family and I reserved 3 rooms at this hotel for 3 nights in July. My husband and I had planned our wedding in London for one year and decided to stay at this boutique hotel as it was very close to our ceremony venue. It was a great decision. The staff was very polite and helpful, we arrived early in the morning and we only had to wait 10 minutes to have our room prepared (they don't have to give it before 13:00 but they did). The rooms have everything you need and are exactly what you see at the webpage. Bed was very comfortable, you have a small kichenette which we used quite a lot, the bathroom is really nice and the shower incredible. Everything is very new. The breakfast is delivered to the room 5-10 minutes after you ask for it and for us it was complete enough.The surroundings are also nice. The tube is very close (Baker Street) and there are plenty of cafes, restaurants, pubs, etc. Using the tube you are close to Oxford Street and two of the main train stations (Paddington and Euston).I can only recommend to go and enjoy it! I hope I can stay at it again sometime in the future!!"
19,910,"Jul 13 2007 	Fantastic Hotel!!!! Amazing Stay!!!	This hotel was a fantastic getaway for 2 nights. Had an executive suite which was pricey at 240 for 2 nights, but was worth it. We had a good sized room, that had a big bed, lounge area, kitchenette, 2 tvs and pc with free internet. The en-suite was great, had a special shower and also and jacuzzi bath. Both mornings we recieved a continental breakfast, which was brought to our room at our specified time. Was a nice touch. We got to the hotel at about 11am as we wanted to go into london and shop etc, so they looked after our bags and when we got back they made us a drink as we had to wait about 5 mins for our room to be finished off. The reception wasvery stylish and comfortable. The location of this hotel is fantastic, very close to Baker street station, Madame Toussauds and the Open air Theatre in regents park, which is why we stayed as we went to watch Jimmy Carr live. Overall, a fantastic hotel!!!"
20,910,"Mar 27 2007 	there are 2 hotels being described in these reviews- take note	I'm not sure what's going on here but it seems there is a mix up. This hotel does not have shared bathrooms- as one reviewer describes (and shows pictures). There are two seperate hotels being described here, i can assure you.The La Suite I stayed at was beautiful, modernly designed and white and pristine. The bed was insanely comfortable and the shower experience was amazing. I can't recall the type name or brand of shower, but it's luxurious and swedish. so great!There's a PC in the room with internet and a quite large flat screen tv. we also had a kitchenette area with cutlery and plates etc. We ordered food with the front desk who recommended a local curry takeaway and delivered it to our room. brilliant! i know it all sounds like an odd layout- but it is designed in a way that everything fits and it is cozy and comfortable.this hotel is a gem. i am still unsure of why it is so inexpensive. it's a great deal for brand new facilities and a lovely staff. i would and WILL stay here again when we are back in London."
21,910,"Mar 6 2007	Perfect!	We just came back of a 3 days city trip in London, what a lovely days. The city is great and very busy (what we like!).We stayed in La Suite, Nothingham Place and this made the weekend incredible! Perfect service and an excelent room where we found the rest in a super bed, with watching a nice DVD, after a busy day and to get the power for the next long day! Debbie en Erik, Rotterdam, Netherlands."
22,910,"Nov 24 2006 	La Suite Hotel is awful	Read before considering this hotel. It is not anything like the picture!!!! Beware!!!! Totally misrepresented!!!!La Suite Hotel37 Nottingham PlaceLondon W1U 5LT[----]We were supposed to stay at the Hotel La Suite for 6 nights beginning on the 13th of November. We arrived by Taxi and once we were inside and looking around it became clear that this was not the hotel that was described on their website. The hotel is totally misrepresented on their web site. Prior to booking I had made several direct phone calls from the US asking questions. They assured me that this hotel was elegant and of four star quality. We visit London 3 times a year and have stayed in several four star hotels including Melia White House, London Landmark, The Cumberland and several Thistles (in the London area ). Frankly, over the past 6 years we have been quite pleased with our stays in the London area. The La Suite Hotel is unfortunately nowhere near that calibre and is grossly overrated at 4 stars. I request that you take a bit of time and investigate for yourselves. I do not wish for this kind of experience to happen to other people who may be visiting London.Upon seeing the lobby and lounge (so called?) my husband wisely requested to see the room and after viewing it and the rest of the hotel (and smelling the odour) we decided that we could not possibly stay there. My husband left and summoned a taxi while I stayed requesting to speak with the manager.The manager did not show up for almost 20 minutes and upon being informed of the problem became angry and abusive, yelling at the young lady behind the desk, telling her she should not have shown us the room in advance! He then turned on me and told me that he would charge me for one night whether we liked it or not. They do have a 24 hour cancellation policy but we did show up and would not have left if the hotel was the way it was represented. $313.88 US was a hard earned lesson to be careful choosing hotels in the future.Interestingly enough, our sympathetic taxi driver told us that our case was not all that unusual."
23,910,"Nov 3 2006 	Truely Frightful	How this truly frightful establishment has the gall to call itself a hotel is beyond me, let alone an executive place to stay. This shabby block known as La Suite hosts about 12-15 rooms. The majority of rooms have to suffer the shared bathrooms  something I would wish only upon my worst enemy. Please have a look at the photos Ive uploaded to see the true extent of the horrific shower and toilet facilities the residents have to put up with on a daily basis  thick orange grout in the tiles, decrepit loos (frequently left with deposits from other guests). Don't be fooled by the photos on the website - the reception is lovely, quite where the bedrooms in the pictures are, I have yet to discover.On several occasions I found vermin in my room  rats or mice I am unsure, but the manager told me to get used to it, its London after all. I argued for a re-fund  nothing was given. I decided to investigate further, and took a look at where the food was cooked. If you decide to stay at La Suite, even after reading this review, then I beg you, do not eat the food. It is cooked in the most unsanitary conditions  croissants are baked in the oven which is housed in the basement next to the bins  with a window that is open all day and night (free for all the vermin and roaches to come in).The bedrooms are small with enough room to slip down the side of the bed and use the sink. Theres no matching furniture, and I was never brought fresh towels. Like another reviewer mentioned  the walls are paper thin, and having to listen to the squeaking bed whilst my neighbours relieved themselves soon became rather unpleasant.All in all, this place was horrendous and I would never return  in fact I packed up my bags and left early. The manager kept my payment as thats the sort of business he seems to run, however, I was too distressed to make a big issue of it, and soon found another hotel nearby which was much more accommodating."
24,910,"Oct 9 2006 	Funky fresh and modern - something a little different	If you want something a bit different to the usual 'corporate' hotel, then this may be the place for you. La Suite is near Regent's Park, on a quiet side street. It has been totally refurbished, and is modern and funky. ROOM: I was in a pretty small double room, but it was very clean and well set out. The bed was very comfy (Tempur mattress, I think) with a duvet (no horrid blankets and sheets!) and the power shower was superb!FOOD: There is no restaurant. However, there was a microwave, fridge and kitchen sink in the room, interesting snacks and the continental breakfast brought to my room was lovely (fresh orange juice, fresh coffee, museli, continental breads and jams...very tasty)STAFF: Very polite and helpful.Overall, any negatives (no restaurant, small rooms) were outweighed by the positives (clean, modern, good facilities and breakfast)"
25,910,"Oct 4 2006 	Central and brand new	This is a great hotel, near Marylebone High St. (very hip) and a few minutes walk from Oxford St. Baker St. tube station is the nearest and has three lines including Circle Line. The hotel is new: staff tells me it was completely refurbished in Feb 2006. We had a kitchenette and a little private terrace where we ate a fantastic breakfast (which is brought to you every morning). The decor is high in standard and has all the mod cons: free unlimited broadband access, tea/coffee making, microwave, flat screen TV. The bathroom has a sophistated shower with sauna and Aveda beauty products. Over all impression is very good. Good room rates as well."
26,910,"Jul 18 2006 	Great Hotel Brilliant Location Lovely Staff	I stayed here for three nights (July 11th - 13th) and was really impressed from the moment that I walked into the hotel. I paid 120 per night for a small suite.The front door is constantly locked and can only be opened by either your room card or a member of staff or security, so this made me feel comfortable from the start.Check in was really fast and the gentleman at reception showed me to my suite, carrying my case for me also. He explained everything fully and showed me how the electrical items in the room operated.The room itself was compact, but extremely well appointed. I had a small suite, with a kitchen area, living area, sleeping area and bathroom. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the bedding was beautifully white. The bathroom was also small, but very modern, and came with a superb shower unit that offered a sauna facility also.I ordered food from the delivery serive that the hotel offers, and the food was lovely and arrived within 45 mins as promised and was then delivered to my door.There was FREE broadband internet service via a provided computer within the room, a large plasma TV and a DVD player. The small kitchen area offered drinks and snacks to purchase, a microwave and a fridge, as well as a supply of cutlery and crockery.The hotel was extremely close to Baker Street and all of the main tube links, as well as being close to lots of shops and restaurants, all within a few minutes walk from the hotel.I might regret saying this - but I highly recommend this hotel, and will be staying here again, but I hope that this doesn't mean that it is always fully booked when I need to visit London!Stay here and find out for yourself how lovely it is and really good value for money!"
27,910,"Jul 10 2006	Great place!	This hotel has been recently renovated into a number of suites. Each is decorated in a simple but modern style, is elegant and quiet [a real bonus in London]. The suites have a mini-kitchenette and every room has broadband and a tv etc. A group of us stayed in the largest suite [118] and 117. Everything was clean and comfortable [even the sofa bed!] and the staff were really helpful and friendly. The hotel doesn't have proper aircon, so they had freestanding units with tubes out the window. These seemed to vary in efficiency but it's a minor problem [even though it was 32 degs in London when we were there!].A great location and a good bargain - go there before it becomes too popular!"
28,910,"Jul 7 2006 	Friendly well-located and a good value	This small hotel located in trendy Marylebone offers a lot of extras in the price - free computer with Internet, kitchenette, power shower, and legendary Hastens mattresses. I particularly enjoyed the low-cost calls - USA for only 20p for 15 minutes is a steal, plus a DVD library at reception. The owner was in the hotel and showed me around, and there are free umbrellas to borrow by the door - all in all a good experience!"
29,910,"Jun 9 2006	Great Place	We stayed at the La Suite Hotel for 7 nights and were very happy with our accomodations. It is a small hotel, newly renovated in a modern decor. The room was large, containing a sitting area and mini-kitchen, and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was modern, clean and the shower was excellent. The staff was very friendly and efficient. We liked the location on a quiet street very near the Baker Street tube station and Marylebone High street for restaurants and shopping. Breakfast was brought to the room every morning five minutes after we phoned the lobby to say we were ready for it. Great stay for a great price."
30,910,"Jun 4 2006	Same name -- different hotel?	I just read the three reviews of &quot;La Suite&quot; hotel on this board and it seems we're describing very different hotels with the same name.My wife and I spent 4 nights at the &quot;La Suite Hotel&quot; on Nottingham Place, 2 blocks from the Baker Street station. The hotel is a small converted town home that appears to have been open (or reopened) only since February, 2006. There was still some minor construction in progress. The location is excellent.The decor is modern and clean, appearing exactly like the pictures shown for the hotel's website. Each room has a LCD television and a computer terminal with broadband connection. The first night we were in the smallest (and cheapest) room available, back of the 1st floor. The room was small, but tidy. The next day in the afternoon our room was dusty from the construction in the back, and we were upgraded to the top floor mini-suite. The lift is tiny and the stairs rather narrow, but the suite was very nice with an excellent shower, small microwave, 2 TVs and a set of dishes -- very handy for a light dinner.The staff is from Czech Republic (I think) and very nice. We were both very pleased with our 4 nights stay at this hotel."
31,910,"Oct 22 2004	Institutional and Uncomfortable	This enormous hotel packs in the travellers in their boring &amp; depressing rooms. The lobby is usually clogged with a large group checking in and for this reason getting an elevator can be difficult--so be prepared to lug your suitcase up and down the stairs. Each floor is so large that you have to take a long walk down the hall to reach the common bathrooms. A few of the bathrooms didn't have locks during my stay. The absolute worst part was the fire alarm tests, which would occur each day at about 11am. We weren't told that this was a test however and were unsure the first time whether we should run down the stairs or just keep hanging out in the room. The only favorable attribute is that this hotel is in central London and across the street from the Piccadilly Tube Station."
32,910,"Mar 24 2004	Never again	I have recently (17th - 21st March, 2004) travelled to London on business. I usually stay in the 4* Tower Thistle Hotel, however this time it was fully booked. Because of that, I used the SimplyBookIt website to find another hotel and I decided to stay at the Prince Regent Hotel which is situated in the centre of London.Since the hotel is rated as 3* in some articles (just one star less than Tower Thistle Hotel) and it is privately owned I expected a nice little hotel, perhaps with a bit of character. However, my experience of staying in Prince Regent Hotel were rather bad:? On arrival, I had to wait a long time because there wasn?t anybody around to check me in.? After a long wait in I was told that a cleaner will show me to my room and they will do the check-in later.? The cleaner was not able to unlock the door on my room because of the lock was damaged. It took a while to fiddle around with a key to unlock the room.? The real shock, however, was the state of the room ? small, dark, with a small window, broken showerhead, broken hot water tap, dirty carpet, and damaged and scuffed furniture.? TV set was equipped with aerial giving poor quality picture? The worst, however, was yet to come. The mattress in my bed was so worn out and uneven that I did not get any decent sleep that night.I have immediately complained to the hotel manager and he offered a solution ? if I stayed in the hotel one night (17th of March) and paid ?50 for the night he would cancel the reservation for the second night. I agreed.However, when trying to check-out the next morning I was told by the receptionist that they will loose ?50 because I have booked a room through ?SimplyBookIt? for two nights but only stayed one night ? despite that it was previously agreed with the manager. I wanted to contact ?SimplyBookIt ? in order to resolve the situation, but the receptionist told me that he does not have any contact number for the company, which I find very hard to believe.The receptionist still wanted a charge of ?100, and only on my unrelenting he telephoned the manager of the hotel who told him I would only need to pay ?50. Finaly the receptionist charged my credit card by ?50 + ?10 (cancelation fee).Since I am working in the IT industry I have preferred to book my hotel through the Internet rather than directly and I have chosen SimplyBookIt. This turned out to be a rather bad experience with no possibility to speak to someone at SimplyBookIt and amend my booking. I am not sure whether I will ever use services of SimplyBookIt to book my next stay in London. I would not most certainly recommend it to my friends."

1,911,Sep 30 2009 	No frills but excellent value and everything you need	If you want a reasonably affordable hotel in London which is clean with functional facilities and gives a basic but good breakfast this is a good choice. After some minor issues with the bathroom we were treated very friendly and prompty moved to another room (without even have to carry our luggage). Everything you need.
2,911,"Sep 26 2009 	Clean but avoid the breakfast!	Very friendly staff and excellent parking facilities as I had a LWB Transit also had 3 coaches parked there too.Clean spacious room which were at a high standard with a nice view of a sprawling garden to observe squirrells! I avoided the breakfast after the first day due to asking for poached eggs on toast,and the lady coming over and proceeding to dump a full English on the plate which looked very shabby.My work mates experienced this all throughout the week.Said that I reccommend this hotel for workmen with vans as the parking on the street is a mare,just avoid the breakfast!"
3,911,Sep 4 2009 	ok	the hotel was very clean and the staff at the front desk were very helpful. Our room was a good size however the shower was a bit on the cold side. The area where the hotel is situated is not a nice one. We had two asian women come up to the car one stood in front of the car while the other started to clean our windows we said we didnt want it done but we couldnt move because we were stuck in traffic and the woman stood infront. Theres a lot of that sort of stuff that goes on in that area. Nice hotel to stay at if your just passing through but i would aviod it next time just because of the area its in.
4,911,"Sep 3 2009 	clean place to stay but noisy rooms	hotel was very clean and the staff helpful.the room was nice and well kept, but the walls never kept out any noises from nextdoor. you could hear everything, from people going in and out of their wardrobe to people having a shower.when we went down to breakfast, it was very disapointing indeed. you had to helpyourself, and the lady cooking the breakfast was doing unhygienic things, which i wontmention. the toast didnt taste of bread, and i left breakfast feeling it was not clean enough."
5,911,"Jul 7 2009 	clean but a little bit noisy at night	I stayed with 2 friends at the Leigham Court Hotel for 2 nights, starting on july 4th 2009.We booked a Triple Room, and it was OK: three good beds and a modern bathroom with a shower.It's a bit far from the town center but Streatham Hill rail station is down the road (5 minute walk), with trains to Victoria Station every 16 minutes (monday to Saturday) or every 30 minutes on Sunday.There is a little car park before the hotel, with just enough room for the guests.The only inconvenience is that the hotel is a bit noisy: you can hear the cars passing by at night and what's going on in the neighbouring rooms. Fortunately, we had reasonably quiet neighbours.Staff looked a bit dull and depressed, except the chocolate-faced man, who has been nice and helpful to us.I would recommend this hotel, because it's not too expensive (75 pounds per night for 3 persons) and has with no major drawback."
6,911,"Aug 26 2008	excellent value and clean	Just got back from a pleasant 2 night stay at Leigham Court. We were greeted by a friendly receptionist and directed to our room in the extention part of the hotel. The room, including the large bathroom, was very clean. We had booked a family room for 4. Our room was a triple with an extra bed but still adequate space in the room. It did get quite hot at night and we were pleased that there was a large fan in the room.Hotel was very easy to find - 2 minutes from Streatham Hill main line. We actually got a tube to Clapham Common and then a bus to Streatham Hill - 5 minute bus journey, buses every 10minutes. Bus stops outside hotel and it was quick and easy to get to centre of London on tube from Clapham Common.Cooked breakfast was good. There was also cereal, toast or ham+cheese (all of the 'value' type). Tables were in sets of 8 so we had to share with other guests but the tables were big so we didn't feel crowded. We've stayed in other similar priced hotels nearer central London and found the Leigham to be cleaner and more spacious than other 'quad' rooms we've stayed in. Because of its closeness to public transport we also found it more convenient for central London and Kings Cross ie. no 10 minute walks to tube stations with luggage. I'd definitely stay here again."
7,911,"Jul 9 2008 	good location	we have stayed at this hotel for 2days in 2007 and 2008,visiting wimbledon tennis championships.value for money was our theme,and this hotel provides that.rooms are clean and tidy but a bit dated,and the breakfast is a bit of a free for all,with long bench tables and &quot;help you self&quot;.reminded me of the army mess,but nevertheless the food is ok,including the cooked breakfast.location is good,with plenty of parking space at the hotel.short walk to bus and train links to cental london.in short,you will have a job to find anywhere of this decent quality for the price.[we paid 30 a night each]"
8,911,Jul 7 2008	was a comfortable stay	my husband and i stayed here for 2 nights with our little 2 year old. The room was a god size and was comfortable.Felt unsafe to leave windows open as we the windows opened on to a roof which was easily accessable to others. windows was very high so we had no veiw outside. Other then that it was fine the breakfast was ok although they forgot about us on one day and it was half an hour wait.Was nice when we got it and was good size very satisfying for the day ahead. The staff where helpful and car park was good size got parked there easily enough although can get busy.My little boy got ceoliac disease and they where good working round this.Overal a good stay and we will use the hotel again as it was value for money.
9,911,"Oct 28 2007 	would have been ok for a smoker.	the hotel was a convienent distance to the train and in general nice enough. The room was big the bathroom was tiny but fine for one night. Breakfast was confusing, no instruction of what to do and no one came over so had a bit of toast and left? The main problem was the smell it was like trying to sleep in the lung of a sesoned smoker - overpowering to say the least! when i got to the room the window was open but because of the traffic noise it was hard to sleep with it open but the room was so hot i had to try. Left the next day stinking, all my clothes my hair - yuck. A real shame, but a real smell!"
10,911,"May 7 2007 	Lack of Family Rooms	I booked a family room. When I arrived, just before 3pm, the room was not ready. Bearing in mind Check-in is at 2pm. The room consisted of a double bed and 2 single beds and spelt of stale cigarettes. One of the single beds was put up against the wardrobe, which meant that we had to move the bed to gain access to the wardrobe. My dad was booked into a double room, which was the same size as our 'family' room. I asked at reception if we could be moved into a different family room. I was informed that the hotel only had 2 family rooms. I don't advise families stay in this hotel!!!"
11,911,"Feb 28 2007 	it's ok	The hotel is fine for this price, 30 pound per night. The reception during the night had a good manner and was helpful but the day shift wasn't friendly and helpful. The room was ok but the wall seem to be so thin. I could hear people who lived next door talked and could hear their TV. Even their phone vibrated at night, I could hear it just like it was in my room."
12,911,"Jan 26 2007 	Poor service really!	The counter staff have really bad manners! Rooms are small with an awkward layout. Reception is weak, so you can forget about tv."
13,911,"Nov 6 2006	Noisy with roaming teenagers	The hotel is easy to find, well sign-posted. They said that there would be room in the car park if we arrived before six and there was. We were in the extension at the back of the hotel, a long L-shaped corridor with single story rooms. Comfortable rooms and warm. Might have been very acceptable except for the 40 or so young teenagers from abroad who roamed the corridor, now a source of echoing noise, and gathered in various rooms until well into the small hours. The adult supervisors were obviously somewhere else in the hotel. The only alternatives to a boring cooked breakfast were corn flakes and white bread toast. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from Streatham Hill station which is also a major bus stop. The 417 bus runs from outside the hotel to Clapham Common. This could have been a good place to stay, at a modest price, but if they are targeting groups of young students and similar, to fill their rooms, you won't get a good night's sleep."
14,911,Mar 5 2006 	Location And Value	Almost didn't stay here after seeing some reviews but much better than some suggested. 45 a night B&amp;B and upgraded to very pleasant en-suite double room with far more space than you might expect.Hotel situated in a quiet ? residential street in Streatham Hill on south side of city. Streatham Hill Rly Station a couple of minutes walk away with a train every 15 minutes for Balham (Northern Line) and London Victoria. Can't get much better than that can you? Lots of pubs and all types of eating places within 5 minutes walk. Staff friendly and helpful.Drawbacks? Breakfasts a bit basic but unlimited toast and coffee that actually tasted of coffee (something even expensive hotels can't manage). Oh and the shower took a couple of minutes to warm up but after that was fine.
15,911,"Aug 9 2005	Once again a great hotel	Second stay at the hotel this year, same as last time. Brilliant service, lovely clean room, lots of tea and coffee, missed breakfast as overslept, but the first time round it was lovely so am sure it would have been again. Would definitely stay in this hotel again if I am in the area, we were there for a concert at Brixton Academy and it was a 5 minute bus ride away, very convinient. Well done! A budget hotel that isn't a total mess!"
16,911,"Mar 16 2005	Felt very safe and it was very clean	Our stay here was very nice. Very secure and clean. Rooms were large and staff was extremely friendly. Breakfast was a fulfilling. Hard to find, but a good location after you find it, easy access to train travel."
17,911,"Nov 1 2004	What you see is what you get	No frills - This place really is just for sleeping and it fits its purpose perfectly. Have stayed a couple of times and recommend the rooms in the Annexe as they are better. Breakfast is fine; a basic full english, endless toast and hot /cold drinks, cereal or continental (I agree that the continental brekkie does leave a lot to be desired). Central heating seems to be a constant theme, it was permanently on during my latest stay although this is no bad thing at this time of year!"
18,911,"Mar 23 2004	Avoid the breakfasts!	Rooms clean but far too warm. My radiator thermostat was broken and I slept with the window open all night in Winter. Handy for the railway and the southern end of the Northern Line.Avoid the breakfast, esp the Continental (one slice of Dairylea, one slice of Tesco economy ham). Lots of places to eat (and some to drink) within 5 minute walk at Streatham Hill"
19,911,"Oct 29 2003	Adequate - clean 	This hotel is an adequet place if you are planing a a short trip to London cheap, clean, and freindly staff, and if all you want is somewhere to lay your head you should have no problemsRooms - clean- the towels were changes on all 3 days we were there and they also made our bedsBreakfast - fine they don't mind you having extra toast etc. unlimited tea &amp; coffeeStaff - friendly and helpful esp. the ladies who make your breakfast.only problems was there are no tea/coffee making fac. in the rooms unless you pay 20 deposit And the radiator was very hot and because the switch was broken we couldn't turn it down - but as soon as we informed reception 20mins someone was up sorting it outWe are a young family of 4 and we enjoyed our stay."

4,914,Jul 7 2008 	Very very basic.	I stayed at the Lidos hotel for 2 nights in at the beginning of July 2008 with my family.The hotel is extremely basic
5,914,Apr 18 2008 	Not the best but great location	I stayed here with friends during the Christmas holidays. It looked like a quaint little place from the outside
6,914,Jan 20 2008 	Very Basic	Just returned from a 1 night (thankfully) stay at the Lodos.The hotel staff were very nice and friendly and after hiking to the 3rd floor was a little disappointed with the overall state of the room. I knew it was going to be basic from the price we paid
7,914,Jan 4 2008 	Gross	When booking I knew it wasn't going to be fancy but I expected it to be at least clean. The staff were very friendly and it's ideally located right beside Victoria Station. Our room looked fine on first glance but then I realised the carpet looked like it hadn't been hoovered in 5 months and when I had a shower it hadn't been cleaned. I had the delight of showering in a shower with pubic hair all over the walls. The shower head was fixed to the wall so I couldn't wash the hair away.The plug hole was completely blocked (by what I suspect were more pubes) which meant it over -flowed all over the bathroom floor. The pole on which the shower curtain hung was completely lopsided so I couldn't pull back the curtain without it sliding back. Needless to say I didn't have another shower for the remainder of my stay. If the room had been cleaned initially there wouldn't have been any problems. It's a shame as the staff were most pleasant and helpful.	
8,914,Nov 14 2007 	very basic	Very basic 
9,914,Nov 8 2007 	Value for Money	Hotel is exactly what you would expect for the price we paid this close to the main attractions. You are literally a 5 - 10 minute walk from Pimlico station and around 15 min to Victoria.The hotel itself is quite dated but spotlessly clean and staff (in the daytime) were lovely
10,914,Aug 23 2007 	Cheap clean and very good located	Very good location (10 minute walk from Victoria station). Nice welcome by the staff who provide us with a lot of informations. We got a small but nice room in the basement: it was clean except for the bedspreads that we promptly removed. Expect to pay an extra fee if you want to pay by credit card. The breakfast was abundant with jam
11,914,May 18 2007 	Horrible	Stayed in February .Paid £35.00 b and b. Knew it was not going to be a Palace at this rate but I was definitely surprised
12,914,Oct 28 2006 	Small but clean and good location	I stayed at the Lidos with three friends. We arrived at about 11 pm. We were happy with the location of the hotel
13,914,Oct 10 2006 	Not all that it is made out to be..!	I made two bookings for the Lidos on separate nights. The first night we arrived close to 10pm
14,914,Sep 13 2006	Cheap and clean	For those looking for a clean place to stay on a budget in a good neighborhood close to Victoria Station
15,914,Sep 6 2006 	Not recommended	I stayed in this hotel for one night
16,914,Jul 31 2006 	Great staff room as expected	The room was really nothing fancy at all... a closet at the top of four flights of stairs. The private shower was a bonus. The bathrooms were not attractive
17,914,Dec 6 2005	Tiny rooms but at least clean	I was travelling with my two adult children
18,914,Nov 15 2005	Small but cheap	Apparently

1,919,Apr 5 2009 	It is Crap- DO NOT STAY THERE	My partner and I stayed for one night. We booked it at the last minute. It looked lovely from the outside and it was in a good location. The room was not brilliant the carpet was dirty. We had a shared bathroom and it was a nightmare to get a chance to use it! when we finally managed to use it there was no toilet paper and no one at the so called 24 hour reception to ask for toilet paper. We recon they are so tight that they only leave one roll in the toilet at a time!Then we went for breakfast oh i wish we hadn't! YUK!! It was THE WORST BREAKFAST EVER!! when it arrived on our table it looked pathetic it was a spoonful of beans one bacon one egg (which you needed a steak knife to cut it with) and the tiniest sausage Ive ever seen. But then i actually tried it and i was nearly sick! it looked like it had all been reheated a 100 times! A breakfast well worth missing!!
2,919,"Jan 5 2009 	Nice little hotel!	Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel from 31/12/08 for 3 nights. It is in a great location on a quiet street and about a 2 minute walk from Kings Cross/St Pancras stations so ideal for the underground. We had a basic double room and I was expecting it to be small but it was quite large and had a washbasin in it. The room also had a fridge with a small freezer compartment in! This was ideal for keeping our drinks in. The room also has a tv with a dvd player built in too. We didnt manage to have any breakfast so I can't comment on what that was like. Overall it is a nice hotel and it was cheap considering we went over new year. It is not a luxury hotel but it is in a good, quiet location and I would stay again."
3,919,"Jul 16 2008 	Great Location..... Served its purpose	I booked this hotel at the very last minute an event in London. I was looking for a cheap comfortable hotel as close to the centre of London as possible. The location of this hotel is fantastic as its only a 2 minute walk to Kings Cross Station.I booked this hotel on a third-party web site however upon arrival they had no booking for me. They were very friendly and found me another room which was available.The rooms are very small however they had ensuite facilities (shower dribbles) and television in the rooms. The hotel web site says parking is available outside the hotel HOWEVER it is 6 pence per minute and please take note that you can only stay for MAXIMUM of 2hrs with no return. On Saturdays after 1330 and all day Sunday it is free to park there for as long as you like. Another point to note if driving, both ends to Argyle Street are no entry as its a one way system. I found my way in via Crestfield Street and Argyle Square!I went out in the evening and didn't return until the early hours of the morning. The hotel is 24hr access however I had to stand out side ringing the doorbell for 15 minutes before anyone answered!For a cheap hotel this is a fantastic stay. I only paid 50 for a double ensuite room and I must say even though there were faults, you definatley get value for money for central London.Overall, a good clean basic hotel which is fabulously located only 2 minutes from Kings Cross Station. The staff are very friendly and helpful."
4,919,"Jul 14 2008	Dont book this hotel	Dont trust the people who run this hotel!! Booked a room through TravelStay.com just over 3 months in advance. On the morning of our arrival they telephoned my home address to see if I still wanted the booking. Yes i replied.On reaching the hotel I was told by the receptionist that my room was already taken and that because they didnt want to lose my custom, they had booked me into another hotel just around the corner. the receptionist led us there. She took us down into the basement where the room was located. It smelt of urine and body odour, the light fitting was hanging off the ceiling, the windows and mirrors hadnt ever seen a cloth, the bedding stank of body odour etc etc...To put the smell problem right, the receptionist went back to the LISA COURT HOTEL and returned with some air freshener which she promptly sprayed around the corridor, the room and then into the carpet!!! Unbelievable..Having read the reviews on TravelStay I was looking forward to a clean and pleasant stay, not to be led to a hovel round the corner."
5,919,"May 28 2008 	Dirty Sheets	The price was cheap so we did not expect luxeries for our stay there. It was centrally located and quiet at night. Shared bath facilities was clean. Saturday night was a battle to get near the loo though but otherwise it was ok. We stayed there for 3 nights. On arrival the room had clean sheets , coffee and tea sachets etc..However the room was NOT cleaned for 3 days. No clean Sheets..NO fresh Towels and NO extra coffee and tea bags. The bin overflowed with rubbish. The window was BROKEN and to open it we had to prop it up with a coke can or the trash bin! The TV was a waste of time because there was zero signal..Pathetic. The breakfast consisted of a hot dog and baked beans and an egg..not what I call english breakfast..but again for the price..the toast was good.Would I go again? No! no matter how cheap and convenient..clean sheets and clean towels is a MUST. I see they have now increased their price . I really hope that includes an upgrade in the service and sheets offered!Cheers"
6,919,"Apr 7 2008 	Don't Go	I had to stay in London overnight and had read reviews on this hotel and thought I would take a chance. My room was single with no en suite which was fine. The room was very small, TV didn't work and one of the socket had blown. The bed was okay and the sheets clean and it was quiet. The toilet didn't flush, the second toilet had no toilet paper (so take tissues or toilet paper). The breakfast, well, I don't consider baked beans, one fried egg, slice of ham, and a thin hot dog breakfast. I was asked if I wanted tea or coffee, I choose tea, it was delivered in a cup with tea bag. I was grateful for a roof over my head, but suggest to look somewhere else. I know I paid 35 pounds, but at least make sure the appliances work, walls are painted and it doesn't look like a slum room."
7,919,"Mar 24 2008 	Lisa Hotel - Cheap but...	I booked this hotel for 1 night (Saturday) - a single room was only 30, which is very cheap for such a central location and many hotels in this area won't accept a one night booking at weekends. On the positive side, despite its central location, it was actually quiet at night. I knew that the room wasn't ensuite and for 30 I didn't expect it. But there weren't enough bathrooms or toilets and the water flow was very poor so that it took ages for a toilet cistern to re-fill once it had been flushed. Also, it's a small hotel without a lift and I had to go down 2 flights of stairs to the nearest toilet, so it's not suitable for a disabled person. The lock on the bedroom door was very flimsy and could easily have been forced with a hard push. The wardrobe had no hangers whatsoever. The hotel website advertises that the full English breakfast is served until 10 am on Sunday mornings but when I arrived at 9.30 I was told that they stopped serving at 9am. I was offered tea and toast but no discount. I'd probably try somewhere else next time. There are a lot of cheap hotels in this street and the adjoining ones, so it's worth looking nearby."

1,921,Sep 14 2009 	Hot box	Stayed in the coverted council flat (aka apartment). Needed a &quot;ladder&quot; to get in and out of bath tub. No soap. Pixellated 12&quot; TV. No air conditioning. Would be OK in winter with the heat coming through neighbours wall and through water storage heater in hall requiring windows to be kept open all night and door during day. Curtains falling off. Kitchen drawers with no handles. Access to other part of unit locked off - why??In general lack of detail however staff in the &quot;hotel&quot; in the main street friendly and nice. Unit cleaned and serviced daily ! Close to amenities and can easily walk to town! Pub meals in area very good.
2,921,"Aug 28 2009 	noisy but otherwize perfect	Stayed there for 2 nights. Nice and clean rooms, friendly staff. Close to the station. We will go back on our next trip."
3,921,"Jul 3 2009 	Excellent value	I stayed here when I was in London for business and I was very happy with it. Itmight not look so great outside but inside it's well appointed, I had an ensuite, tv and radio and it's clean as a whistle. As I had a room at the back, it was quiet too. If you ook breafast it's served ithe little Italian cafe below, which is good value and has pleasant and efficient service. Soutwark is a great part of London to stay ith a good city vibe, Borough Maeket and the Cathedral near by, good range of restaurants and about 15 minutes to the Tate, Millenium Bridge etc. Previously I've stayed in big, anonymous London hotels but in future, I'll stay here."
4,921,"May 21 2009 	Noisy but good!	Hotel room has lots of space, beds and bathroom are nice. Very good for the price you pay. I can only complain of the noisy outside. Either ask for a room in the back of the hotel or walk a lot around London to fell asleep as a brick ... :)"
5,921,"Apr 29 2009 	Very clean and well maintained	The room was a single without a bathroom, so very small, but the place was spotlessly clean, and the communal shower room was also spotless. I don't think you will find better for the money."
6,921,"Feb 6 2009 	Fantastic Little Hotel	Stayed to cover a late night and early start in the office - fantastic little place recently decorated, very nicely fitted out with the biggest towels I've seen in any hotel let alone a budget one! Hotel is good quality, excellent price and great location - definitely worth staying if you're on a budget. Also - although they don't have internet, if you have a room at the front, you can pick up the signal from Starbucks across the road!"
7,921,"Oct 28 2008 	spotlessly clean	stayed here on a business trip, primarily because it was right next to the tube and i was arriving late in the evening. staff were friendly and room/en suite was spotlessly clean. room was comfortable and would stay again.could have done with a plug socket nearer to the bathroom so it would have been easier for straightening my hair in a mirror but the extension lead reached just about."
8,921,"Sep 5 2008	Great hotel	Stayed here for one night as part of a two day trip 2 London. Was so easy to get to and had no trouble finding it at all. We were impressed with the room, (a double) which was clean and looked newly done out. Nice bathroom with a big shower and very clean!! Also provided tea and coffee facilities which was good. Didnt see many staff but when i did they were very friendly and helpful. Overall a good hotel, quite central and easy to get 2 most major tourist attractions. Would definitely reccomend!"
9,921,"Feb 21 2008 	Clean convenient 	Booked a twin room for one night as we were on a business trip in this area of London. The location was ideal - right next door to the entrance of the Borough Underground station. The price was reasonable but I was a bit concerned that it might be a bit ropey - having stayed in lots of budget London hotels before!!Very pleasantly surprised!! The lady that greeted us was very friendly and the room was very clean and looked newly refurbished. It was also much bigger than I expected. The bathroom looked newly fitted too and was much bigger than in most smaller hotels. The best bit was the extra big shower cubicle - I can't stand those tiny, claustrophobic ones you normally get. This was at least twice the size of a normal cubicle. We were at the back of the building so there was no road noise at all. Only minus I would mention is that there was no mirror in the bedroom which was a bit inconvenient.There's no restaurant within the hotel, but it's directly above a nice little cafe that has an extensive, reasonably priced breakfast menu. Also there are several restaurants within a couple of minutes walk for your evening meal. We went to a Greek called Tas and it was divine! In summary - clean &amp; convenient. Ideal budget hotel."
10,921,Jul 3 2007 	Nice little hotel	Just returned from London and stayed in this hotel. It is a small hotel located in a business district within walking distance of London and Tower bridges. It is also right next to a subway stop so traveling around is very convenient. The hotel is reasonably priced and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The staff was very helpful. There is no phone in the room so you'll have to use a cell or the payphones across the street. There is coffee and tea in the room and a nice little cafe downstairs for breakfast. My boyfriend and I were referred by friends who live in Greenwich and we were very happy with the hotel. We plan to stay there again on our next trip to London.
11,921,"Jun 7 2007 	Small Clean Convenient	Stayed at this small but pleasant hotel in March 2007 in a twin room with my son.Outside of hotel is not impressive, being located in an old building above a coffee shop, and the hotel itself is on the first floor (no lift).Once inside however, the place is immaculately clean and newly decorated as advertised, with welcome in-room tea-making facilities (there is no breakfast room, and no breakfast is offered).The staff we met were helpful and polite, and the room was pleasant and quiet, with en-suite facilities.Bathroom contained a large shower, and the facilities are all new looking and spotless.Borough underground station is right next door, which is undoubtedly handy for getting in and out of central tourist areas, but this station is hardly manned (ticket office shut on sunday also) and there is lift access to the platforms. Since Borough High Street is not a tourist area at all really, and quite deserted in the evenings, we found it a bit unnerving to be the only people getting off at the 'Borough' stop at 10pm and ascending up from a deserted platform, and had I known it would be that quiet I would have taken a taxi back to the hotel...This is not relative to the hotel itself, which was absolutely fine inside, but I think is useful information for anyone planning a stay there (especially women travelling alone?)."

1,924,"stay somewhere else	We spent 2 weekend nights at the London Guards and could not wait to leave. The receptionist barely spoke to us when we checked in..we had to ask about breakfast times, check out etc. and were given one word answers. We stayed in a quad room that smelled like my grandmothers attic. Luckily our next hotel in Edinburgh had laundry facilites because our clothes all smelled musty. My daughter fell badly on a wet floor coming downstairs one morning (no signs posting it was wet) and the 3 employees who were watching didn't say a word or try to help. Unbelievable. The Lancaster Gate tube stop was also shut down so it wasn't even convenient. The breakfast was sufficient and the servers were polite. This is about the only positive thing I can say about this hotel. There are too many other options in London to stay at this hotel."
2,924,"Nov 18 2009	Best cost hotel in London	Its not the Ritz, but in my opinion the best value London accommodation. Larger than normal rooms which are clean, have tea/coffee facilites, a safe with breakfast included."
3,924,"Nov 1 2009 	decent	The hotel is in a great location. walking distance from Padington station. The room was clean and there was a fridge, but the shower was old and not the best experience. for one-two nights in a low price I would recommend, but not more than that."
4,924,"Oct 26 2009 	Safe location next to Hyde park	I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a nice, quite, reasonably priced for the area, place to stay in London. The location seemed very safe for tourists. The rooms were large and clean. The continental breakfast was nice. It is close to the Swan Pub for excellant fish and chips. The steps to get into the rooms were quirky, but it was definitely better that I had been led to expect for this type of B&amp;B in London. I would definitely stay there again!"
5,924,"Oct 20 2009 	Dissapointed If I'd Paid the normal rates	Easy to get to from Paddington Train and Lancaster Gate tube station and a stroll from Hyde Park, a few local shops and a Fullers pub. Arrived to a reception full of luggage and the guy on reception assumed that as I was within earshot of the previous guest that I wouldn't need to have the same info repeated when I checked in i.e that the bar was shut beacuse it was Sunday. Double Room on the ground floor was average size for a London room and it soon warmed up once the heating was on. Agree with previous reviews that the hotel/rooms could do with bit of TLC inc the bathroom and the portable TV in the room must have been around for a bit as all the symbols had worn off the remote! (thought a LCD TV was a given in this star hotel). Saying that the room was clean and laid out with fresh folded towells and toiletries in the bathroom. Not the quietest room (G3) including the fridge in the room which whilst useful did wake me up a few times during the night. Got a double room for 45 (against the 135 rack rate) which was a bargain through a Hotels site (via Trip Advisor) so the rating is based on that price and it was last double room available. If I'd paid the full rate, I would have given it a 2 rating and I'm not convinced staying longer than a couple of days would be a great experience"
6,924,"Oct 16 2009 	Charm and character	We spent a week at the London Guard and had a great room on the top floor! This is an older building with wonderful charm and character. The beds were firm and comfortable and everything was clean. The lift worked and we didn't have to walk down miles of corridors to get to it. The continental breakfast was more than adequate including a variety of cereals, yogurt, fruit, toast and croissants. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. Internet was available in the lobby for 1 pound for 30 minutes. We have stayed at several London Hotels and this is definitely the best for the money."
7,924,"Sep 20 2009 	London Guards is on guard for your comfort	Thank you to those whose positive reviews led me to this great value hotel a stone's throw from Hyde Park at Lancaster Gate. It may be a little worn, and the lobby may be navy blue and pink, but this is a very clean, honest, budget hotel with staff who are friendly and helpful, even after working a double shift...We booked a twin, and got an L-shaped room (301) with a double and a twin, tv, desk, and spotless bathroom with a bathtub. Towel rack heater in bath was a plus, as was the mini fridge. Paid 50 euros on Hotels.com.Breakfast, served in the basement, includes a great choice of cereals, toasts, and nutella. Orange juice is industrial-strength gut rot.Tip on flushing the toilets there - push the lever down hard, and hold...hold...hold.Coin internet, passable but a bit slow - there is a big internet caf near Bayswater tube station."
8,924,Sep 18 2009 	Great location - comfortable enough	We stayed at the hotel for 2 weeks - the breakfast had enough that you could go several days before it got boring. The location was awesome! One block from Hyde Park to start or end the day with a relaxing stroll. Close to Paddington Station to walk once you take the train from Heathrow.The room was nice and clean - and had lots of space for luggage and purchases. We had our own bathroom which had a tub with a shower.We don't really ask a lot of the staff at the hotel - clean the room and make the bed and we are happy. The front desk was useful the one time we asked for information.This hotel is great for having a great location and a comfortable place to sleep. If you are looking for a place to relax and spend lots of time in then not the place for you.
9,924,"Sep 13 2009 	Nice location old hotel can't complain	When we checked in the desk clerk couldn't find our reservations, luckily we'd brought our reservation confirmation and they were able to find us a room. Our room was very small and it had only one double bed for my wife, 5 yr old daughter and I to share. The carpets were stained and looked dirty enough my wife wouldn't walk around barefoot. The bathroom was small, but the shower had maybe the best water pressure I've ever experienced in a hotel. The rather cramped bed was comfortable.We liked that the room had a small refrigerator. The maids gave us fresh towels each day. At night it was very quiet. There is a complimentary continental breakfast.The best thing was its location. It is only a few minute walk to the Lancaster Gate Underground station and Kensington Gardens (which is a great place to take kids who are tired of sightseeing). From the airport it is a single transfer on the underground (from the Piccadilly line to the Central line) to get there. Notting Hill is 2-3 minute underground ride or a 15 minute walk. This puts stores and inexpensive restaurants nearby. If we go back to London we'd consider this hotel again but probably only stay here if it offered the best deal."
10,924,"Jul 30 2009 	Other reviews are accurate - I got what I expected.	I chose this hotel based on other tripadvisor reviews and I was not disappointed. I have no other experiences with London hotels, but it was pretty much as expected: clean but tired furniture and decor, a lift, plumbing that worked, a basic continental breakfast in the basement dining room, and staff that were reasonably pleasant and helpful.Our quad room on the ground floor (semi-basement) was next to the main airconditioning units which were noisy, and the bathroom was a bit musty, so we asked to be moved to another room, which they did. I think that this room was probably one of the poorest located in the building, so we were a bit unlucky. The replacement room on the first floor was excellent. Note that the double beds creak loudly and are a bit on the firm side. Very quiet neighbourhood, plenty of cabs down the street, great central location, and a variety of restuarants &amp; shops in close walking distance. Given the price and the age/style of the buildings, I thought this was fair value with no major annoyances or disappointments to spoil our stay of 6 nights.."
