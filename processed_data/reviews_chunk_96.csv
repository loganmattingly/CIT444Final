360,2030,"Jul 21 2003	Poor poor poor	We went to the Clift on honeymoon. The rooms were minimalist and stylish, but the walls are paper thin and you can hear the person snore in the room next door. It's massively overpriced, the space is cramped, and anyone who wants a boutique hotel experience is best off finding it elsewhere. There are plenty of better hotels in San Francisco I am sure"
361,2030,"Jun 2 2003	Never Again	If you are into dark and trendy then this is the spot for you. Blaring techno music from the bar floods the foyer when you walk in. The front desk people have no more personality than Ken and Barbie (which they strongly resemble). The bathrooms are small and the shower curtain cheap (it will keep attacking you and not stay in place when you shower) for 300-400 a night you would think they could get better. The worst part was the &quot;valet&quot; parking where they fail to tell you it costs $40 a night to park in the garage, I could have gone around the corner for $10. Make sure you check the price list BEFORE you even think of eating anything in the room a box of animal crackers 3.75, give me a break!!! Next time Im in San Francisco I will be staying somewhere else."
362,2030,"May 17 2003	Great beds and great service	We enjoyed our stay immensely at the Clift May 1-5, 2003. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. It is true that the walls are thin and the bathrooms are rather small. However, it was meticulously clean. Some of the reviews said the staff was snooty. I didn't find that to be the case. They were very friendly. The concierge gave good restaurant recommendations. You can get a great pot of coffee from room service for $10 after all the service charges -- but there's a Starbuck's across the street. Great Pacific Tours stops at this hotel and they offer a wonderul all-day tour of the wine country. There's also a great diner called Lori's just around the corner for a terrific breakfast. We were on the sixth floor. The decor might not be for everyone. The lobby lighting is dim, but there were ample lights and lamps in the guest rooms. Overall, a terrific place to stay. I paid $150 a night from Expedia. I recommend it."

1,2031,"Nov 23 2009 	Good value for a clean and comfortable room.	The location is good for this hotel in the financial district. It is close to the Embarcadero BART station, which makes getting around pretty easy. The rooms are comfortable but no frills. A nice touch is the free bottled water by the elevators and free wireless internet. A great value!"
2,2031,"Nov 16 2009 	Efficient	If I had to describe this hotel in one word it would be &quot;efficient&quot;. I booked this hotel on Priceline, name your price, for $75/night for a Friday and Saturday in November. After reading the reviews I was a little worried but I was pleasantly surprised. Hotel - Located almost next to the Embarcardero Center in the financial district. If you are visiting for business it is perfect and it is just fine for a leisure visit. We took a cab to Fisherman's warf but walked back with no problem. There is limited parking in the area so be sure to carefully read all the signs. The free wifi was a nice feature and was helpful with the iPhone. Check in and out was quick.Room - Yes, the room is small...but not that small. I have stayed in smaller rooms in Europe. The room is laid out well which does not make it seem small. I am 6' and my husband is 6'2&quot;, so if we can feel compfortable other people should not be complaining. If you are booking a hotel to enjoy the hotel ammenities then do not go here. If you just want a nice clean room while traveling then book away. The free purified water is a nice feature. The walls are thin but I guess we had quiet neighbors so it was not a problem. Yes, the hallways are on the more narrow side but you are not spending time in the hall. No view to speak of but ours was not horrible. The tv is in a more awkward spot and could easily be remidied with a flat screen mounted accross from the bed but that might not be what business travelers are looking for.Bathroom - Small and only a shower, but like I said if you want to relax and enjoy the hotel room then look elsewhere. The water was hot and the water pressure strong. The only strange thing if that there was a gap between the door and door frame so you could see in and out...should really be adjusted. Overall the bathroom was fine and very clean.Parking - We parked in a city garage a block away and thought we got a great deal, but oh were we wrong. The sign said $7 evenings and weekends. We confirmed our interpretation of the sign with the garage attendant when we pulled in and parked at about 8pm Friday night and pulled the car out Sunday at about 10am expecting to pay $21. We were charged $50!! We thought we had confirmed with the attendant that we would pay $7 for friday night, $7 for Saturday and the full $7 for the partial day on Sunday. However, they charged us as though we parked all day Friday. The new attendant said that we only would have paid $21 if we pulled the car out Saturday morning and reparked it immedately after. In what universe does this make any sense. Friday night rolled into a weekend so I have no idea why I was paying for Friday (day) when we were never in the garage. Since it is a city garage I can almost guarantee we will never see that money again so we will try to dispute the credit card charge and see if they have a better shot. BEWARE!"
3,2031,"Oct 23 2009 	Cheap and great location	This is a really basic hotel in a great location. Pluses: te rooms are clean, beds are comfortable, free wi fi.Cons: outdated tv, workout room is small dirty and worn."
4,2031,"Oct 17 2009 	Clean. Safe. Affordable.	I gave it 4 stars for being everything I wanted: cheap, CLEAN, and safe. It's really probably a 3 star hotel in terms of amenities. This hotel is meant for the utilitarian business traveler who has no need for the frills of a fancy hotel. However it has very uptodate modern and to the point decor which probably helps keep costs low and maintain a high standard in terms of the overall hotel. It's in the business district but who cares in SF you have plenty of transportation options."
5,2031,"Oct 8 2009 	Fair for the price	The hotel matched the price. It is definetly a business travelor hotel. The room was tiney, but the location was perfect for us. It was right next to The Punch Line and close enough to BART and MUNI."
6,2031,"Oct 6 2009 	Sara (Senior Manager) Dropped The Ball	I stayed at the San Fransico Club Quarters the first week of October. I found the hotel to be centrally located to everything I needed to commute to. I stayed in room 721 which was supposed to be a king but was actually a queen bed. The walls were thin and a bit noisy at night with people coming and going. The kitchenette was not like in the pictures but was very handy. I had no view from my room. If I left it at that I would rate my stay a 3 or 4 but upon check out the front desk hit me with an erroneous charge on my bank card and held funds that I needed on my next leg of my trip. I called the hotel and they tried to put the burden of resolution on my bank. As the merchant Club Quarters needed to release an authorization they kept calling a charge / refund but would not. There was no charge or credit, just a pending authorization. This killed my chance to visit the Grand Canyon from my next destination Las Vegas. I will never stay at this location and will never live this down. In all my travels my concerns have never been dismissed like Sara did. Being senior manager I would think that she would go the extra mile. She didn't even meet me half way. Stay at your own risk."
7,2031,"Sep 29 2009 	A Bit Basic but Good	When I stayed here in the past, I got a teeny, tiny room. This time I got a room with a king bed and it was very nice. Bathroom was a decent size, not like a cruise ship bathroom. Bed was comfy. Floor space was adequate. All the other amenities were as others described. Two things I'd like to add. The coffee in the club room is much better than in your hotel room - worth a trip downstairs. And the washer and dryer were FREE. I worked out a lot that week, and I was very pleased to discover the laundry room was complimentary. You could buy detergent from the vending machine for $1. So I got all clean clothes after that nice surprise."
8,2031,"Sep 27 2009 	Totally great accommodations	I've never written a review on a hotel, but after reading the negative reviews on here, I want to give my story. All the usual good hotels were booked a month ahead due to a convention, and a travel service booked me at CQ. Reading the reviews, I thought it was a fleabag hotel and I'd be miserable. Imagine my surprise. Efficient, friendly, helpful check-in ladies, I was in the room in 5 minutes, with a friendly reminder that &quot;we're a full-service hotel, so call us for anything you need&quot;. The wireless internet didn't work, and 10 minutes after my call they'd brought a Cat-5 cable and hooked me up. The room was great -- clean, comfortable, nicely decorated, with kitchen (stove top, oven, sink), study area, nice tv and DVD player, etc. I even had a great view of the bay -- stay in room 1105 and you'll see what I mean. I simply could not ask for more. It was a great stay and I'd be happy to visit CQ again any time."
9,2031,"Sep 9 2009 	Good Location - Nice Hotel	We came to SF during the Marathon this past summer. My husband and I had a room and we also traveled with friends (who were the actual marathon runners!) and their children.The atomosphere/decor at the hotel was nice. Somewhat modern and in good shape. The rear area of the lobby had 3 computer stations, a TV, tea and coffee. I hear there is a nice rooftop area, however, we never made it up there! It's adjacent to the pub next door, which we had a light lunch at after the marathon.A plus is the chilled water stations when you exit the elevators. You can grab fresh bottle water 24/7.Our room was small, but just enough for the weekend. The bathroom and closet doors were this neo-metal style - fun and different. The bathroom was equipped with a shower (no tub). There is free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel -bonus!!Our friend's room had a mini-living room area (not seperate) with a pull out sofa bed for 1 and small table. They had a bathroom w/ tub and a small kitchenette area (sink, micro, coffee maker and small fridge).This hotel is within walking distance of the Embarcadero Shopping area, the Ferry Station and Market Street. We walked to Union Square and could have walked to North Beach as well.It's not a touristy area, so after 5/weekends, it's a bit quieter. But easy to get to all of the good spots. I recommend this hotel for a short weekend stay (for tourists) and definitely for members longer stays."
10,2031,"Sep 6 2009 	Well worth it!	After reading the negative reviews of this hotel, I booked it anyway because of the price and proximity to the local transportation. After staying here, I will definately come back if the price is right. The check in takes seconds as you enter your credit card into a kiosk and it kicks out your room key. The room that I got was for a solo traveler and met my needs perfectly. The A/C / heater worked fine, the bathroom was very nice (a bit small) but the shower tile although clean, looked a bit dated. The shower head was AWESOME especially compared to other hotels. The room included a desk for your laptop, an ergonomic chair, a television (older tube type), a microwave, a coffee maker, closet and a small fridge. Every floor has a purified chilled water dispenser with empty sealed plastic water bottles for you to fill. I have never stayed at a hotel that offered you unlimited free water! There is a restaurant downstairs (Elephant &amp; Castle) and a Starbucks about thirty feet from the front door. The elevator requires a room key which helps to secure the hotel. There is also a sun deck on the 11th floor and a &quot;club&quot; room with televisions, coffee and computers. I have visited San Francisco many times and the hotels are alwasy EXPENSIVE until now. The Embarcadero Center is right across the street and the BART is about 3 blocks away (cable cars stops located next to the BART station). Great location, within walking distance to downtown and the Embarcadero. The only downside is the parking. You need to park across the street in an underground structure for $39 a day ($49 a day if you want in/out access). Most hotels in the Union square area charge about $50 a day so it's on par."
11,2031,"Sep 4 2009 	good value	i arrived here mid afternoon after a long flight from england,it was close to embarcadero bart station and easy to find,thestaff were polite and professinal and the room was spacious,clean, and quiet. all in all a bargain for the 55 i paid on hotels.com!"
12,2031,"Aug 13 2009 	Great Visit Outstanding Service	I don't write reviews on hotel stays very often, but felt compelled to this time. There are some very negative reviews, but I wonder if the people really tried to have their situation rectified by the front desk. I booked through Priceline for $99 and was very worried with some of the reviews. My wife, brother and I were all planning on sharing a room. The day before I called and requested 2 singles thinking my wife and I could sleep on a single. When we checked in it was my wife and I, and my brother was coming in later. The check in staff was super friendly, and they informed us we had a gift bag someone had dropped off (we were there for a family wedding). When they gave us the bag we commented that it was nice they dropped it off, and there was a bottle of wine inside. The manager saw there was a bottle of wine and immediately said, &quot;We'll send up a couple of wine glasses and a corkscrew in case you want to open that tonight&quot;. I told them my brother would be checking in later, and they took his name and got a key ready. When we got to our room it was smaller than a normal US hotel room, but I think some of the small room complaints people have never stayed in hotels in NYC or SF. Even in the large expensive chains rooms in these 2 cities can be very small compared to anywhere else in the US. The room was plenty big for what we needed, had a clean bathroom, and as we were putting down our luggage the wine glasses and corkscrew arrived. We had saw the singles looked a little small, so we asked the guy with the wine glasses for a rollaway. Not much longer and he was back with a rollaway that was the same size as the 2 singles. The beds were comfy, and our pillows were very nice, and we are very picky on pillows. All this alone and I would have felt to give a good review to counter some of the negative ones (if my bathroom stunk, I'd ask for a different room, if the front desk doesn't accommodate then I'd leave a bad review). Everything was cleaned nicely for our 3 night stay. To top things off, and what really made me give all 5 stars was the value the front desk service added. We had a late night flight on the day we checked out, so we slept in. We weren't bothered and checked out around 1 without any extra charge or hastle. Then we asked if we could keep our bags there and they said ok. We went off and got some food and a bottle of wine at the ferry building, and were going to have a picnic. I remembered that I saw the hotel said it had a rooftop sun deck so I thought maybe we could go up there. We went back to the hotel, and the manager said sure, he gave us 2 wine glasses, another corkscrew, and a key that had access to the top floor so we could go on the deck. This is all after we checked out! The views from the deck were nice, and it was the perfect spot for mid afternoon wine, cheese, salami and bread we had picked up at the Ferry building. There is also a work out room that my wife used, and stations with bottles and filtered water you can fill up on most the floors. Sure the rooms aren't that big, and some of the furnishings might not be what you'd get at a 3.5 star hotel in other cities, but the value for the money and service offered made this a fantastic stay for us."
13,2031,"Jul 12 2009 	Don't do it.	Forget the positive reviews here. No way, no how this is a 3.5 star hotel. Yes, San Francisco is a place that you spend your free time outdoors. However, when you're indoors, you need a hotel that accommodates your needs, like working, reliable wifi, key cards that work in your doors and elevators, and comfortable beds. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. I booked on Hotwire (never again) and got the rate at 99.00. I would gladly spend another 20 to 50 in order to get 1) INTERNTET CONNECTIVITY FOR WORK, and 2) a comfortable bed. My bed has clearly never been rotated....the indention is like the grand canyon. I cannot wait to leave this place. If this rant even posts, I'll be impresses because for 1/2 day I've not been able to connect. The front &quot;desk&quot; acts exasperated in you request to connect. Oh, and my &quot;bathroom&quot; smells like a wet sponge. I had to out to Walgreens to buy Lysol. It's disgusting. DONT DO IT."
14,2031,"Jul 3 2009 	I'm loving it	I have been here 5 weeks now and find this place to be very comfortable and safe - a real plus for a woman alone. I am in a &quot;small one bedroom apartment&quot; with a patio/terrace which makes it all seem so much bigger. I am able to cook in the pullman style kitchen - it's all I need. I wish there were more than 2 washers and dryers on the lower level but again - not a big deal. For the price, this place is great for a long term stay. The staff is very friendly and helpful - my few complaints have been handled very promptly and completely. The weekly maid service and twice weekly trash pick up is adequate to keep it clean. The biggest drawback was that the Elephant and Castle Pub next door is supposed to give me a discount and they can never ever get it right and their service is slooowww"
15,2031,"Jun 25 2009 	Great Hotel but you get what you pay for!	To everyone who has give this a bad review, to everyone who has complained that the rooms are to small, Too dark, too noisy at night, too much external noise, or that there was one to help carry your bags, Ill say this, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!! A lot of reviews want Fairmont standards in a less than $100 a night, that not going to happen. What I paid for and got in return was fantastic. There are a lot of reviews saying that the rooms are to small, which to a certain degree is right (they are not Fairmont size rooms), however do you go to San Francisco and sit in your room all day complaining about the size, most people only stay in their rooms to shower and sleep, then does it matter what size the room is? Our room had a bedroom and a separate living room, we had two TV , a large desk, sofa bed, kitchenette and over looked the ferry terminal building!! This hotel is supposed to have a 3.5 star rating, that is not the case. 2.5 - 3 maybe, at a push. The reason that this hotel is so cheap is because they do cut back on certain standard hotel items such as the number of towels you have in the room, the frequency that they renew the shampoo etc in the washroom etc. I booked through price line and got this hotel. After reading the reviews on this website, I was a little nervous about staying here, but after my visit I would book this hotel again. This hotel is great value in a great location, what more can you ask for, for about $100 a night??"
16,2031,Jun 18 2009 	Disgusting Dirty	Bathroom smelledSheets never cleaned Not even comforterWhen we arrived the bedding smelledEvery morning they'd fix sheets and the same stains were still thereBedding sticky you could even smell people residue on them upon arrivalHalls dark and dingy
17,2031,"Jun 3 2009 	Met our needs perfectly	I definitely don't think this place is a 3.5 star for Priceline, but it met our needs perfectly. We paid $114 for one night. Since it's in San Fran (downtown...location worked well,) we weren't in the room much. The room was much larger than expected after reading some other people's reviews. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom had room to put our stuff down. It's not a fancy place, but it met our needs perfectly and I'd be happy to stay there again."
18,2031,"May 26 2009 	Stay away from this hotel if you can!	Priceline booked me at Club Quarters in San Francisco, which it reflected as 3 1/2 stars. Our experience at this hotel is awful. I traveled with an infant and my wife. The bed was too small for even two. Hotel desk asked me to sleep on the floor. Being with no options, I opted to and requested a Bedsheet and a Comforter. They did not provide either an extra Bed Sheet or a Comforter. The staff was rude and highly non co-operative.This hotel experience was a nightmare, spoiled my entire trip."
19,2031,"May 4 2009 	Not the Greatest Thing on Eartch	My husband and I live in the East Bay. We had a one night certificate from our stay at Club Quarters in London. The entire hotel had water problems one morning. Since we have the certificate we decided to have dinner and spend the night at Club Quarters in San Francisco. The location is very close to Embarcardero and BART. Well, the room was clean, but we felt that we were spending the night in the closet. The San Francisco's Club Quarters was no comparison to London's. The common room didn't have wine/ soda hours. The floor didn't have a water dispenser with individual. The front desk staff was rude."
20,2031,"Apr 10 2009 	Good business hotel	Pros$80 a night, so inexpensive for SF (thank you, Priceline)close to the embarcarderoclose to the BART stationloved the guest comfort stationwonderful front desk personnelCons:When we checked in, our floor was fine. When we came back after dinner, our entire floor smelled like an Indian restaurant was in full production. Blech! That smell lingered for 3 days.Thin walls"
21,2031,"Mar 30 2009 	You'll get more for your money elsewhere.Truly not at 3.5! MAYBE 2!	Got this room by bid, which was the biggest ripoff of of my life. I could have booked this supposedly &quot;member only&quot; room on booking.com for less than priceline charged me. I am infuriated and they will hear from me. Also, this hotel is not even the level of a Holiday Inn Express. It seriously looks just a bit more than a lowest level Carnival cruiseline stateroom. Weird doors, walls that are cubicle like boards. You can hear everything going on 2-3 rooms around you, on top and below. The service, is fair to poor. Ordered food through a sponsored 3rd party, and although it is not the hotels fault that the restaurant forgot silverware and napkins, you think that the front desk could have sent us up what we needed in a before our food got cold. They did not do it all. The 11lth floor sundeck which was little more than a 8 x 8 concrete pad with a big vent, had a dozen questionable looking young men smoking pot there. No king beds, and you will not get two beds unless they are twins(BEWARE OF THIS, if you are traveling with a person you do not know well). No fans in bathrooms. Not enough towels. You will not sleep until 2 or 3 in the morning because of the street noise. JUST STAY AWAY. I can usually find something good in all places, and this place had a couple of good points. Clean, good free coffee downstairs, a decent little workout room, free bottled water on all floors, and good books in the rooms(you cannot take them). Too bad, this might offset the bad value of the rooms. The location is central but not really close to anything of leisure, good only for those who are working in financial district. I guess you can get free shuttle to the airport I hear, and they did hold on to our bags for us while we shopped after checkout. Don't go hear unless you are by yourself, are a good sleeper, and have business downtown anyway. Hopefully you can get a rate for less than $70 a night or less, 'cuz it is just not worth it. Oh yeah, bring your own amentities b/c what they give you is scant."
22,2031,"Mar 13 2009 	Definately a business hotel	My husband and I stayed at Club Quarters several times over a six month period in 2007-2008. We finally decided to look for other accomodations, so I though I'd write the pros and cons to help others decide if it is right for them.It is definitely a great place to stay for a few nights if you are a single business traveler and have business in the Financial District. The price is much lower than other hotels in the area. But the rooms are also small and rather unremarkable. The decor is various shades of dark blue, so the rooms are not what I would call &quot;cheerful&quot;. Staying for a week or two at a time, it actually became depressing.Also, for a long stay, there are not many restaurant choices. The main meal in the financial district is lunch, so if you want breakfast or dinner, your choices are limited without going for at least a 20 minute walk in any direction.Pluses are that the hotel is safe and very clean and staff is very friendly. They arranged for me to use one of their conference rooms at no change when I needed to hold a business meeting and then have amenities helpful to a business traveler like being able to print documents from your laptop.But I wouldn't recommend it for a vacation or honeymoon."
23,2031,"Feb 16 2009 	Clean not overally ""luxurious"" but good location and value if you get it cheap	Firstly, after reading other reviews some things I would like to avise to those looking at this hotel.1. The walls are thin.. no maybes. You know when you hear this your thinking: &quot;Ohh well maybe it was just they're room and we'll get away with it..&quot; NO.. they are thin haha. Its no too bad and thankfully we were on what seemed to be a pretty quiet floor. But you can still hear people walking around outside your room around 12-12.30 so if it really bothers you, I would recommend against this place because that factor is there.2. It isn't a &quot;luxury&quot; hotel by any stretch of the imagination if you were hoping for that. Having said that it was nice and comfortable. Definitely like a Hyatt Express or one of those. We got it for $75/ night for 2 nights so that was pretty good for Valentine's day wknd in the Financial district I think. It did have free refillable water bottles, Wireless, Coffee and computers down stairs with printers.. cant complain about that. But the rooms were basic.. we were in 615, had a Queen bed, little fridge and microwave, small tv in an almost &quot;college style&quot; desk setup with everything on or around it. The Bathroom was actually quite nice, big shower, decent sink and space etc. - Staff were friendly and helpfull.. gave us a 6pm check out as we had a light flight for $35 instead of $75.. and generally were good with questions and stuff we asked, although did seem very overwhelmed at check out time with only 2 staff.Anyway, aside from those things I would say its a good hotel to stay if you can get it cheap. Otherwise I would definitely try and find something a bit more upmarket if its going to be too much more expensive.Hope this helps..Cheers"
24,2031,"Feb 7 2009 	Just right for business travel	If you would rather open your own doors, carry your own bags, get your own extra blankets and pillows and store your own snacks and beverages in your room refrigerator, then this is the hotel for you. Because of the great price I spent a little extra on the kitchenette which consisted of a sink, fairly large refrigerator, microwave and plates, bowls and silverware. If you don't have time to shop for basic snacks and beverages, you can have the hotel shop for you for from a limited grocery list for a service charge of $2.50. A coffee maker, coffee, coffee mugs and real half-and-half were also provided.The room itself was spacious and comfortable. The queen size bed had down pillows and a down comforter. Room climate was controlled by a thermostat control in the room. The window opened so I was able to let in some fresh air. There was a comfortable workstation with easy-to-access electircal outlets and a desk lamp. They even provided a couple dictionaries and books to read. The clock-radio had an easy-to-set alarm and even gave me the option of plugging in my iPod or other MP3 player (it was not a docking station, however).The bathroom was small but very clean. It had just a shower stall with an adjustable height hand-held sprayer. A magnifying cosmetic mirror, hair dryer and basic amenities (shampoo, soap, mouthwash) were adequate.There were 2 small nightstands with 2 drawers that were large enought for me to unpack my entire week's worth of clothes. There was also a padded hanger and standard wooden hangers in the closet. I personally don't iron, but for those who do, the ironing board and iron are located in a &quot;guest closet&quot; down the hall, along with extra blankets, pillows, coffee, creamer and sweetener.There were also nice amenities in the hotel. The bottled water station was very convenient as was the coffee station in the club room just off the lobby. The club room was a comfortable spot to meet in the mornings before heading off to the office. If you don't want the standard hotel coffee, a Starbucks is right next door.The front desk clerk, Peter, was very helpful in recommending restaraunts within walking distance. He suggested a French bistro, Jacks on Jaunte, which was fabulous!One evening we had drinks at the attached Elephant &amp; Castle. It was a nice pub and the prices were affordable. Checkout was quick and easy via one of the three self-serve kiosks in the lobby.I will definitely be staying at Club Quarters next time I'm in San Francisco on business. I would not stay here with family, however, as the rooms were really not large enough for more than one or two people."
25,2031,"Jan 22 2009 	Good location but 3 stars at best	The Club Quarters makes the most of what they can offer. I booked the hotel via priceline by bidding for a 3 1/2 star or higher hotel. This hotel is not equal to a Hyatt or Marriott. It is 3 star at best. It is very similar to a Hilton Garden Inn or Residence Inn. The bed was soft and a queen only. The sheets were normal to thin and only two pillows on the bed. The room was very small and the bathroom even smaller. The two towels provided were stratchy. Overall, it simply didn't match what I was expecting for a 3 1/2 star priceline hotel. Everything was very clean and felt very fresh. However, the rooms are dated with small tub TVs, and older microwaves and frig. All was in great working order and again very clean.Location: The hotel is in a nice location about 5 blocks from BART and across the street from Embarcadero 1 which is a nice outdoor shopping area that extends 4 blocks to Market . There are plenty of restraurants nearby including a starbucks right next door, a bar/pub attached, a Pete's coffee a block down, and a Chevy's a block away.. .Free Extras: The cllub quarters does go far to try to please. The staff was very friendly, the area past the entry/elevators is a nice comfortable gathering area with couches, fresh flowers, TV, and free coffee/tea. 3 computers with free internet are provided and wireless runs through the building for free. There are irons, extra blankets, and bottled water next to the elevators provided free of charge.Families: The rooms are much too small to have more than 2 people in the room. They are ideally set for 1 person. However, the rooms were clearly larger rooms in a past life and it looks like many could be connected at the entry. So, a possible solution for families is to check on connecting rooms. For the price and location, this is likely the cheapest way in this part of SF to stay separated from the kids.Overall, I truly can't recommend this hotel as our expectations were higher. We would definitely stay at the Hyatt Embarcadero over Club Quarters every time even if the price was twice as much. However, with Priceline picking the location, I didn't have that option. I would recommend club quarters for folks on a tight budget and want a great location in SF."
26,2031,"Jan 5 2009	Bathroom a disappointment	Staying here is like staying in an upscale college dorm. The ambiance is basic but with a nod toward the plush. It's obviously geared toward long-term business travelers. My one big concern was the bathroom. It was not up to a three-star standard. The ventilation system is almost nil. Worse yet, the gap between the bathroom door and the frame was ludicrously wide, offering little privacy in terms of noise and, ahem, odors. A real disappointment."
27,2031,"Dec 6 2008	Enjoyed Club Quarters	We just got back from a one-night stay at Club Quarters. Lots of pluses but one very big minus, which is why I didn't give it four stars. We Pricelined the room for a very good price, so didn't indicate any preferences. We apparently got a room on a smoking floor, which I didn't even know existed anymore in San Francisco, and after we left I felt like I had just smoked two packs of cigarettes! I know I should have asked to change rooms, but we weren't going to be spending much time in the room at all so I decided to suck it up. Anyway, if you don't like smoking rooms, be sure to ask for a non-smoking room because they do not do a good job of covering up the smoke smell.That negative aside, I like the Club Quarters chain a lot. We have also stayed at a Club Quarters near Wall Street in New York. The rooms are small but functional. We like the Club Room, open to all guests, which has free coffee, tea, magazines, newspapers and internet. They also have a self-service laundry, which is very unusual, and a small but nice fitness center. The location is good for public transportation options. You can walk to BART, Muni, Chinatown, North Beach, Union Square, Embarcadero area and the financial district. It is primarily a business area, but tourists may enjoy it. I didn't particularly because I work in the area so felt like I was still at work. There is a movie theater showing independent and foreign movies across the street at the Embarcadero Center that is quite nice."
28,2031,"Nov 27 2008 	Nice Hotel at a Great Location	This was my first stay at a Club Quarters hotel, and I chose it for its location at the Embarcadero area of San Francisco, which I find to be a terrific location for a base to explore the city. The hotel is quite nice. I found the bathroom to be surprisingly small for an American hotel, though. They serve great coffee in the lobby in the morning, and there is free internet access in the lobby from a statinary computer they have. Also, the hotel has no parking, so if you rent a car be prepared for very high parking rates at area garages. Generally, you don't need a car in San Francisco, necessarily, but I was on a business trip, and had to travel to the suburbs as well."
29,2031,"Nov 11 2008 	Very comfortable for the price	My girlfireind and i just got back from a girls weekend at San Fransico. We had a great time.....our room was a kitchnette on the fifth floor. We asked for a quieter room in the hotel and i believe we ended up on the west side of the building. Every day we ran into our maid and she was very polite and asked us each day if we wanted our room done.....we were helping conserve water and put the do not need service door hanger on, but she wanted to make sure we were taken care of.....very polite and all other staff was very helpful in answering questions. I would stay there again...."
30,2031,"Oct 19 2008 	CQ SF exceeded my expectations.	My wife and I live in the South Bay Area and attended a weekend wedding in SF (Oct'08).For some reason there were alot of events in the the City that weekend and every hotel I tried was sold out. I then managed to book Hotwire for 3.5* hotel (plus it was a good price)... I got the Club Quarters hotel. I looked up CQ on Trip Advisor and after reading some of the reviews I was slightly nervous that the Wife would be angry at me for lack of romantic stay in SF.I pre-warned my wife I wasn't able to book a super romantic hotel. I called CQ in advance and asked for quiet room as high up as possible. When we arrived the Clerk was very polite and gave us room 1105. Upon entering our room we were pleasantly surprised (helps to lower your expectations in advance). I think they upgraded us to a suite. We had views of City skyline and partial view of Bay. Queen bed, kitchenette, couch, etc. Nice breezes when the windows were open. Starbuck's next door made for easy mornings and kitchenette handy for some late night snacks. The hotel back corner we were in was very private and quiet and we enjoyed our weekend stay (especially for the &lt;$200/weekend_night price I paid). The Wife is a tough customer but she actually really enjoyed her stay and said she would stay there again.I found free parking pretty easily around the corner on the street (most SF hotels $30+/night for parking).I think alot depends on the room you get. I got lucky (for a change). Overall, the hotel is not one of these swanky uber-hotels but it was clean and fairly new, the staff was always timely and courteous, and great location in Financial District."
31,2031,"Oct 18 2008 	Value for money if you're a member	I checked into the club quarters when I couldn't get a room at the Hyatt Regency for a conference I was attending. Club Quarters admits both regular visitors and also members of its club, who get a discounted rate. Overall, I think the place provides pretty good value for your money, especially if you are a member. It is well located in the heart of the business district and very close to china town and the embarcadero. I loved the free internet; it always amazes me that the more expensive joints (yes Hyatt, that's you!) always stick on these little ticky-tack extra charges; at Club quarters, it is clear their goal is to provide clean, efficient hotel rooms at a good price. The room was pleasant in a mod sort of way, and it seemed designed in a practical way, with a nice desk for work, and a shower-only instead of a space-consuming tub. The other reviewers are right about the noise although - you can easily hear people in the hall outside, though I didn't notice much noise from my neighbors. I think they get a pretty considerate bunch of guests, who seem to be pretty quiet. I will consider joining the &quot;club&quot; to try out other branches of the hotel."
32,2031,"Oct 13 2008 	Paper Thin Walls	You know it's bad when you sneeze and the people in the next room bless you (actually happened). We could hear the lightest of sounds from both of our neighbors, and they weren't loud people. I can't ever imagine staying here again; it's the biggest lack of privacy I have ever experienced in a hotel."
33,2031,"Oct 12 2008 	Not for Light Sleepers but Good Overall	I stayed here for 3 weeks for a business trip. I specifically asked my travel agent for a hotel close to Embarcadero Center with a kitchenette and that's what I got. The location is really great, and I was able to eat somewhat normally during my stay thanks to the Safeway a couple blocks away. The hotel is adjoined to Elephant &amp; Castle though for those Strongbow and Shepherd's Pie cravings. And this Seattlite was thrilled about the Starbucks on the corner for my morning fix on the way into the office.The room was kept clean yet complied with common-sense environmental concerns (sheets/towels not changed daily). I really liked that they had water bottle refill stations on the floors to minimize plastic in the landfills.The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, and didn't judge me when I asked for that extra complimentary box of delicious cookies. :)I really only have two issues:1.) Considering the length of my stay I was disappointed that I wasn't given a better standard room (like one with a decent exterior window) or even perhaps a free upgrade. To be fair I didn't ask, but I would think some system to recognize long stays would be in place as part of a standard client-service program.2.) The walls are ridiculously thin. The weeknights weren't too much of a problem since the hotel mainly caters to business travelers. But I could literally hear the conversations of the people in the next room just as though they were in *my* room and that was a problem one weekend night at about 2:30 am when my neighbors got home from the club."
34,2031,"Sep 30 2008	Good location good value	I liked this hotel. The location was good. You can walk to Chinatown in 10 minutes, to the Embarcadero Bart station in 10 minutes, to the Powel /Market Street cable car in 15 minutes. Union Square was about 15 minutes walk away. THere were lots of coffee places nearby. THe room was a little on the small side, but acceptable. The bed sheets were really comfortable, and the bed was also really comfortable. There is free unlimited purified water with free bottles you fill yourself. THe adjacent restaurant Elephant and Castle was good and not expensive for what it was. There is free internet in the lobby lounge, and free wifi throughout. My room was quiet, but the room doors were not as solid as you might want. Nice amenities in the bathroom: great soap, shampoo, mouthwash.THere is a nice desk/work area. The financial district location was good for me. Others may prefer to be closer to Union Square, but it wasn't too far away.THere was a sign in the lobby that sometimes you can get an upgrade to a suite for only $25 a night, most likely on weekends."
35,2031,"Sep 14 2008 	Good hotel in a great location	Firstly, if you know what you are in SF for, you should choose your spot in the city (or outside) accordingly. Different parts of the city tend to provide better access to different areas; though the city is a mere ~25 or so Sq. Miles, so walking anywhere is always an option if you're into it (bring good shoes). But be aware that the Financial District (which is where this hotel is) is a BUSINESS location, so the immediate area effectively shits down after 5/6pm and on weekends -- this includes most restaurants and shops. You'll have to walk at least 1/4 mile in any direction to find things open.- Location &amp; what to doThe Club Quarters (CQ) is smack dab in the center of the Financial District, litterally next door to the Trans America building (the Pyramid). It's approximately a 1.5 mile walk to the famous Fisherman's Wharf and Peir 39, where all the touristy restaraunts and great food (and Sea Lions) await. You can also grab some live entertainment for various panhandlers and performers. Walking staight down Clay street towards the bay will take you directly into the Ferry Building, an historic building with some more GREAT food and even small fresh food markets with locally grown/harvested/baked foods. You can also catch a ferry from here to pretty much anywhere on the bay -- Sausilito, Berkley, etc. On the way there you will see a huge open square where the weekends will sometimes provide you a small open market and some other spontaneous activities in the park. I caught a large group of people dancing on the large pavilion to loud music and everyone, performers and spectators alike, where dancing around. Later, it broke up and everyone (performers included) just went along with their business - pretty cool.Going west from the Hotel will land you at California st. which is one of the more famous Trolly rides that goes up one of the steepest hills in SF with a main road. BEWARE: trolly rides ar 5 bucks each person, each ride, regardless of how long you ride - PER TROLLY. The tickets do not transfer you to a new trolly. A little further west gets you to Market Street where you can spend all of your money in very short order.You can also walk to China-Town and Little Italy for somwe different foods and cultures. A really nice walk to buy souveniers if you're into that.A short drive away is also Muir Woods. if you're in town for a shot while with not enough time for Yosemite or the Sequioa forest, this will get you a VERY excellent view of the great redwoods in a relatively small forest compared to the two above, but large enough to offer several trails directly through the redwoods and over a rive a few times. It also has miles of trails the coast for some excellent views. This is a must do for the nature lover to get out of the city for a few hours. It's just north of SanFrancisco, over the Golden Gate a little ways. LOOK IT UP!- The HotelThe Hotel is a nice, small, hotel. The rooms are nice, but not very spacious. You'll need to understand that you're not buying into a large and luxurious room, here, but rather one that gives you a great location with a reasonable price that doesnt fall off the end of the quality scale by any means. The CQ is a different kind of hotel that caters to business people during the week and only allows recreational guests on weekends... supposedly. That said, the rooms are nice &amp; efficiently equipped. The Queen beds are not luxurious, but they gave me a good nights rest. There are extra sheets and blankets at the end of the hall for guests to take at will. There is a desk and a standard boxy hotel sofa-chair in the room. There is a rather small tv placed as from the bed as possible, which made for some less than ideal TV viewing when i was slumming, but i got used to it. There's good lighting and pretty darn good AC in the room. There wasnt really enough storage for my clothes which meant i used by suitcase for storage a lot. My room was an outside perimeter room with a view into the alley -- this made sleeping challenging at first since they seem to empty a LOT of garbage in that alley all night long.The bathroom is a shower stall with a very accomodating shower head with great pressure, a sink and counter and a toilet, all in a room roughly 5 x 10ish. You've got plenty of room to do what you need to do with relative comfort.Other Amenities - At the end of the hall there is a wonderful purified water machine that dumps tastey water into sealed fresh clean bottles they provide there for you to fill at will.Laundry services are free with a vending machine that sells soap and fabric softener along with other basic toiletries and medical supplies (tums, asprin, etc). There is a sun-deck on the top floor which gives you a neat view of the city and a glimpse of the bay between the high-rises. Good enough for two bathers and a couple of people around a round table.fitness services where respectable with the same water machines in the room along with a TV and the basic equipment. One really nice feature of CQ is that they will bring a stepper or cycle to your room for free.The attached Elephant &amp; Castle restaurant offers English and American pub food with a really nice english breakfast and some pretty decent foods. A nice selection of beers are also offered here with what appeared to be good selection of wines and a full bar.The checkout process was the easiest i ever had. I slid my hotel key, clicked a few on-screen options, slid my credit card and it spit out my itemized hotel receipt. I wish they could all be that easy!!I paid a negotiated company rate around 160 bucks a night, which was reasonable comsidering my great location in downtown SF.Overall Review:A Good hotel at a decent price in a great spot. The convenience meant i didnt have to pay for a car. Public transportation was easy to use and not invonvenient, and CHEAP if you use the MUNI system. The staff was pretty invisbile, which was fine for me. I would stay here again."
36,2031,"Sep 9 2008 	Not Bad	This hotel was average, the rooms were basic and adequate. There was only one bed, so my friend and I had to share. Parking was ridiculously expensive, but that's SF. I would recommend this hotel for business travelers."
37,2031,"Sep 2 2008 	Great for the price	Room was clean albeit small. Bed was comfy, there was a desk and chair, and quiet for us on the 4th Floor. Parking is expensive in SFO--$30, but since we only paid $140 total for room per night, we can live with it. At the Hilton--$50 parking!Neighborhood seemed safe, drug store and Starbucks nearby. Walk to cable car or Chinatown or embarcadero.Desk people helpful, next to pub with office workers for happy hour and breakfast."
38,2031,"Sep 2 2008 	loved it	free bottled water in hallway was awesome.the hotel was clean and great.we upgraded to a suite upon arrival.the only thing that was bad, was rooms only have 1 bed. me and my friend had to share a bed, but luckily we are both small females.i would definetly stay there again.walked to many locations closeby,chinatown &amp; embarcadero."
39,2031,"Aug 29 2008	super clean and very comfortable	we stayed at club quarters san francisco for one night at the end of an awesome trip around san francisco, lake tahoe and santa cruz. we checked in pretty late and they upgraded us to a suite. tons of space, front desk was very nice, free bottled water, very clean, great area about a 5 minute walk to the waterfront market.will stay there again and will use other club quarter locations."
40,2031,"Aug 26 2008 	Businesslike and clean	I was at a conference at the Palace Hotel last week (really nice - but full) so was looking for a mid range alternative within walking distance of the main SF attractions (my wife was staying with me too). Club Quarters was pretty easy to find but doesn't have it's own parking lot so you have to pull up outside, check in and then park at 1 Embarcadero across the street ($30 a night).Our room was pretty small but clean and comfortable. The bathroom was also small but the shower was oversized so overall not too bad.The location is fine. Close to Chinatown if that's your bag. Close enough to the Business district, Union Square etc. Someone commented that Fisherman's Wharf is 3 miles away. It really isn't. It's probably just over a mile to Pier 39 and another half mile or so to Fisherman's Wharf. However, as Fisherman's Wharf is something of a tacky nightmare, proximity to it is of questionable benefit.I kind of knew what to expect with Club Quarters and have to say you get what you pay for. However, this property is in no way a let down - it really is fine for the price and assuming you get a higher floor, quiet. The only improvement I would suggest is a slightly warmer welcome from the front desk. The guys were, well just a little clipped in their style. Fine for me but not very welcoming to some people."
41,2031,"Aug 25 2008 	Ok stay nothing special- kind of weird	We stayed here for the San Francisco Marathon... and it was a great location for that... I can imagine this place is good for business travelers who are in the financial district... but it left much to be desired in the way of warmth. Everything is VERY sterile here... and the rooms are the oddest shaped I've ever seen, and had we not opted for the superior room, we would have been staying in a hole... all the lighting is very institutional... I also felt very itchy in the bed, perhaps the sheets were too rough, or perhaps there were bugs- not sure."
42,2031,"Aug 21 2008 	Should of been called ""Close Quarters""	I recently attended a training course with a work colleuge at this hotel, which lasted four days. It was a long four days. When we arrived, we were encouraged by the stylish lobby, and well appointed communal area. When we reached our shared room, however, any excitement we may have had quickly evaporated. The room was clean, and nicely furnished, but very tiny. There were two twin beds that were about two feet apart. We could not open the front door, bathroom door, or closet door at the same time. The bathroom had a door similar to a shower door, which did not have a knob but a magnetic catch, leaving space between the wall and the door. It did not feel very private. Our window looked out into an alley, where we were entertained daily by the homeless folks who liked to feed the pigeons, or engage in some other activities which I will spare you from. Some of the other people attending the course with us, and also staying in the hotel, were not so lucky. More than one person had to change rooms due to insects. One poor girl woke up with bug bites! The meeting room was below the lobby, so below ground. There were no windows, so spending eight hours a day in there was not enjoyable, no matter what material we were covering. The a/c was very loud, and made hearing our instructor difficult. I did like the location of the hotel, being within walking distance of many tourist attractions. However, I will not be staying there again, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
43,2031,"Aug 11 2008 	Loud Loud Loud!!!	I'll get right to my biggest complaint. This Hotel is loud! You can hear everything that is happening in the hall, and I mean everything. I have never stayed in a hotel with so much hallway noise, and believe me, I've stayed in some busy hotels in places like Bangkok and Paris. I had to find a pharmacy so I could buy earplugs. I don't think I can emphasize enough how loud those halls were! The hotel is clean and the staff is professional, but if you are in San Francisco for pleasure, in particular, there are probably better places to stay. The hotel is very close to China Town which is nice, but it's also in the business district, so many of the small cafes and restaurants are closed on the weekends. That was disappointing! The hotel claims it is only 1.5 miles from Fisherman's Wharf... it's actually a little over 3 miles away. The Golden Gate Bridge, and Golden Gate Park are also quite a ways away. That's all fine and dandy, just don't advertise you're closer to tourism landmarks than you actually are. I will be staying somewhere else when I go back to San Francisco."
44,2031,"Aug 8 2008 	Would stay again	This was a very nice hotel with a very practical room. It was easy to find parking nearby. We parked the car and walked or went by cable car or Muni.There is 3 computers with free internet connection, free coffee and a nice lounge on the groundfloor.The gym was ok.We would surely stay here again if we could find a good price."
45,2031,"Jul 21 2008	not 3.5 stars but ok	While not worthy of the 3.5 stars given it by hotwire (2.5 to 3 are more like it), there's nothing really wrong with this financial district hotel, if you can get it at a reasonable rate. Rooms are smallish, but adequate for a business stay, or a weekend, tho romantic, it ain't! The main problem is that it just isn't close to anything. Tadich Grill is the only &quot;name&quot; restaurant nearby, altho the hotel's own restaurant isn't bad, if you like beer and pub food. Skip the expensive breakfast there and go to McDonald's a couple of blocks away. Hotel is close enough to Muni and Bart so it's easy to get anywhere. A couple of desk clerks didn't speak English very well, and/or were very busy, so it was easier to go across the street to the Meriden and ask the concierge there for assistance.I'd stay here again for the $89 Hotwire rate, but I wouldn't be excited about it."
46,2031,"Jul 7 2008 	Great location but...	*** 2.5 rating ***Pros : Terrific location, and it seems to be easy to get some prices that are a deal for a room in downtown SF (~$100 on Hotwire and such sites), clean functional rooms.Cons : Noises from the halls come straight into the rooms which can be fine during the day, but not at 2 am ! The air conditioning system in my room was a disaster : Stop it and some kind of irregular beat would start emerging from it. When on, it was quite loud, not exactly the sweetest sound to sleep to. The covers the room designers have chosen for the beds is one of the saddest ones I've ever seen, military style in all shades of ugly green.Overall, if it wasn't for the location, I would say &quot;avoid it&quot; But if you need a room in downtown SF, this is not a bad choice. Just don't count on it being romantic and pack your earplugs..."
47,2031,"Jul 6 2008 	Club Quarters SF a great find.	We visit SF often and were thrilled to find an inexpensive place in a great location (walk easily to Ferry Building gourmet world, Chinatown and North Beach) at a reasonable price, especially since the building was new and very clean, as compared to the vintage lower priced hotels. The complaint about small room and small bed must have been from two people trying to stay in a single person room; we had a standard, with Queen bed, and it was large enough. Nothing bumped into anything and there was room for luggage next to the bed and next to the easy chair and next to the work desk. True, few amenities, no luxury, and since I never depend on hotel shampoo, who cares if it is mediocre. Our towels were very fluffy, even though we only got one washcloth. When we asked for extra toilet paper (my mistake; I didn't see the extra roll already there) two rolls were delivered within 5 minutes. The air conditioner and heating unit worked perfectly (from the thermostat on the wall) and was unusually quiet. And by the way, new buildings in San Francisco are not allowed to have windows that open, because of the overuse of utilities that would occur. Noisy guests can be found in any hotel, even 4 star hotels. As for the restaurant downstairs, why would anyone eat there when there are dozens of Zagat rated and dozens of moderate restaurants nearby, including a dozen in the Embarcadero Center across the street and in the Ferry Building 3 blocks away; do your homework!! iIn short, we will return to Club Quarters in San Francisco whenever we can."
48,2031,"Jul 2 2008 	Great stay except for the wi-fi	Loved the location, decor and price. The only real draw back was the wi-fi that went in and out of service. There is a wonderful work desk, good tv reception, nice toiletries, free osmosis water machine in hall, good pub on site, felt very safe/secure, in-room delivery from excellent restaurants nearby, nice staff, and incredibly great pillows! Room decor feels like Japan or a cruise line -- low ceiling, metal doors, shower only (no tub). Loved the fact that I could walk to Tadich Grill, North Beach, Chinatown and the Ferry Building Marketplace.Hotel across the street is Le Meridian and charges four times the price. Embaradero Center cinema complex is also across the street."
49,2031,"Jun 9 2008 	Decent Hotel Small Rooms	Location: If you're looking for nightlife you can walk to, don't stay here. Since it is in the financial district, there is not much to do after business hours or on the weekend. I made this mistake - thought everything was hopping everywhere in San Fran. Not true for this neighborhood. However, it was a quick walk to Pier 1 which has a great farmer's market and a good selection of restaurants. There are plenty of places to eat/get coffee during the day.Rooms: I reserved a standard room. It was tiny, tiny, tiny! It was like a shoebox and there was really poor air circulation - it got quite stuffy. If you stay here, try to get an exterior room and ask if they have any spacious rooms.Decor/layout: This hotel is pretty clever in this arena. While it's small, it makes the most out of it's space and provides modern furniture and fixtures. The front desk is attractive as is the common sitting area. The bathrooms are modern and clean. Ironing boards and irons are housed in a cabinet by the elevators for all to use and then return - there are several and I never had a problem getting one. The hotel also provides complimentary water bottles and filtered water to grab whenever you need.Extras: An Irish restaurant/pub is just on the ground floor so that's convenient. They have a large menu. Food is decent. A laundry room is provided - it's darn cheap. Free internet."
50,2031,"May 20 2008 	Great location so so service	The hotel is located very conveniently near Columbus Avenue (North Beach restaurants), Union Square (shopping), and the Ferry Building. There is also easy access to the BART system and cable cars. The hotel is clean and comfortable with free internet and free bottled water which was great. They are, however, slightly light on the amenities as we only received two towels and a fairly horrible 2 in 1 shampoo. The bathroom is very small and there is also a lack of face cloths and hand towels. On the second night, the cleaning staff forgot to clean our room entirely which we noticed upon returning to the room at about 6 PM. When we inquired at the front desk, the night manager became quite uptight and tried to blame us essentially accusing us of forgetting to remove the do not disturb sign which was not the case at all. We did not get so much as an apology and he was rather rude. Individuals like this should not work in the service industry or should be confined to 1 star hotels next to the highway. Upon returning to our room again at 11 PM we noticed that he had dumped a couple of fresh hotels on the bed but did not bother to even remove the used ones from the floor of the bathroom. This individual gets a rating of &quot;terrible&quot;, and knocks the rating of the entire hotel to a &quot;neutral / average&quot;.Still the rates are quite good for a downtown hotel and if they actually remember to clean your room it is almost like staying in a nicer place."
51,2031,"Apr 26 2008 	Not bad great location	CQ is not a bad place to stay if you're not looking for comfort. We stayed here for a weekend wedding at the City Club. We were on the 4th floor. Location of this hotel is great, right by Embarcadero, china town, little italy. So, if you're not one to hang out in your hotel room much, this is the perfect place to stay. The biggest complaint we have is the towels. They are so worn that they practically scratch your face when you're drying yourself. A couple of our neighbors and some outside noise in the alley really wasn't bad. We'd stay here again for this price. Oh, they still have the old school TVs. You wont find any plasmas or LCDs here."
52,2031,"Apr 17 2008 	Good choice for business traveler	I booked a room at Club Quarters before reading some of the negative reviews here at TripAdvisor. I had selected the hotel based on location and price but a couple of recent reviewers had really roasted the place, so I arrived with some apprehension. My experience was uniformly positive, so I'd like to offer a counterpoint. When I checked in the staff was courteous and pleasant and I was informed that I had been given an upgraded room which turned out to be a small suite. The room was clean, everything worked (including the HVAC), and I never heard a thing from my neighbors. The complimentary WiFi connection seemed quite fast and never dropped out. I found the bed comfortable and the linens fresh.Don't get me wrong--this is not a posh place. It's utilitarian and doesn't offer a lot of frills. The bathroom counter tops are not marble, but the things that mattered to me were just fine. Since I had a suite I can't answer the complaints about room size, but for someone like me, who just wants a comfortable, safe place to spend the night rather than a hotel &quot;experience,&quot; the Club Quarters fit the bill exactly."
53,2031,"Feb 5 2008 	Great financial district location	Hotel has not parking, we were told that it would be 37 dollars per day, however because we stayed at Club Quarters on a week-end we were able to park on the nearby street for free !Our room 534 was on a non-smoking floor, facing a quieter street. Decor is spartan, room is very clean, nice bed, large shower only. Towels are changed every other day. Extra pillows and blankets are available in the hall-way although get yours early as the linen closet is not refilled during the day. There is a filtered water fountain with plastic bottles. The TV is dated. The clock-radio is more recent. The room is small.The window DOES NOT open and we did not like that. The heating system is probably 30 yrs old and difficult to adjust.The Club Quarters is 2 blocks from the end of the Embacardero, 20 minutes walk to fisherman's wharf and the retro trolleys are nearby. Chinatown begins 4 blocks up from hotel. The front desk staff is efficient and correct, not friendly, just very professional. There is a restaurant attached to the hotel, buffet style, for 14 dollars. Okay food, nothing great, ours had to be sent back to the kitchen as our french toasts were so cold the butter did not melt. Our request was meant promptly.Still, if you only want to spend 100 dollars per night and be close to the water and the ferries to Alcatraz Island, you would appreciate this hotel. The business center was very plush, 3 computers and printers with local newspapers, obviously catering to business people in the financial district of SF.Micheline and JordanSeattle, WA USA"
54,2031,"Jan 16 2008 	Doesn't Deserve a 4 star rating AT ALL	While the property is in a good neighborhood, and has excellent neighbors (Le Meridian is across the street) this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Period. Strictly speaking of San Francisco, I have stayed there many times in the last 10 years, and usually keep to hotels I know will provide good service, value, and a resonable room size. Upon checkin, I went to my room (there was no one to assist with luggage at the time) and when I opened it, it was literally the size of a broom closet. The bathroom door had to be completely shut in order to enter and exit the room, and the bed was up against the side wall next to the window. There was a small desk with a chair, but when sitting in it, the chair knocked against the end of the bed. I contacted the front desk and asked for a different room and was told that the hotel had been completely booked...this was the only room available.Normally I'm not a claustrophobic person, but this room was so small that I felt that I had to leave immediately and walk around. I spent most of my time across the street in the Le Meridian and down the Embarcadero at the Hyatt (both of which I've stayed numerous times) in their lobbies conducting business and working on my laptop as the room itself was only suitable for sleeping in and showering.I've since seen other Club Quarters in other cities and have intentionally not stayed with them for fear of a similar disaster. There is no way that this hotel deserves anything more than a 2-star rating, especially in a city like San Francisco that has so many exlemplary places to stay that are in the same price range.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this hotel. It truly is the proverbial wolf in sheep's clothing. If you need to stay in the Financial District, go to the Omni, the Embarcadero Hyatt or Mandarin Oriental and you're bound to have a much better time."
55,2031,"Jan 1 2008 	We couldn't run out of there fast enough.	First off, I'd like to thank Hotwire for &quot;negotiating&quot; this hellhole for us. The hotel (if you want to call it that) lost our reservation too, and if we had known what we were getting into, it would have been better off left lost.Everything about this place is so horrifying that we almost couldn't believe it. We spent upwards of $200 for a room that must have been 100+ sq ft, and barely fit the double bed. My boyfriend and I had to continually stand up and switch positions so that one of us could move around the place. The TV is hooked onto one of those 80s TV wall mounts because there isn't a spare inch to put the thing. Our window faced the garbage, and didn't open (you would understand this gripe if you knew what the ventilation and A/C were like).There was one towel in the bathroom and the closet was like a stand-up coffin. Our door was maybe 1 foot away from the door next to us. Our neighbors did provide endless entertainment - screaming down the hallways, bringing security guards to the door, and one drunken person who thought our room was his and tried, persistently, to open our door.The one luxury they offer is a complimentary &quot;bottled water&quot; vending station, where they stack washed water bottles and you get to fill them yourself with tap water. The receptionists were nice, but that's about it. Needless to say, when the sun came up, we ran. Fast."
56,2031,"Dec 24 2007	Great hotel off the beaten path	I stayed here at the beginning of December after getting a deal from Priceline. I discovered Club Quarters for the first time in Chicago last summer. Before that, I had never even heard of this hotel. From what I gather, it's a membership hotel, but they open the hotel to non-members on weekends. All the rooms are clean, comfortable and modern with free internet access and water; and all the rooms have a shower versus a tub. This hotel had a 24 hour fitness center, but I didn't have the opportunity to use it. The hotel is nice, but one thing you should be aware of is that every room is different. Some rooms are very small, some are larger. I've stayed at the Chicago hotel twice and the rooms and layout were different. I don't think this hotel has a parking valet - at least they didn't the night I stayed there. I was here on a Saturday night and chose to street park, which ended up working well since after 6pm and all day Sunday, street parking was free. As for the location, if you're looking for the hustle and bustle of Union Square, you may want to rething this area. It's in the Financial District, which I guess is more happening during the workweek. Right across the street from Embarcadero Center, it's about a 10-15 minute walk to Union Square, and is right next to the Transamerica building. I did a lot of walking to Union Square, which is about 10-15 minute by foot, and also would walk over to the Civic Center area which took about 35 minutes. If you know where you are going, you can map out a route in which you avoid some of the infamous San Francisco hills. As for safety, it can get pretty quiet at night and mostly what you'll see is homeless and tourists. Since once I parked, I kept my vehicle in one place, I walked everywhere and had no issues walking at all hours of the day and night.As far as price, this is a great alternative to Union Square and I give this hotel high marks for it's individuality. It's like a very nice boutique hotel."
57,2031,"Nov 14 2007 	Convienent and clean	I stayed at this hotel for a conference at the Moscone Center; it was significantly less expensive than the hotels closer to the Moscone Center even with the special conference rate.I arrived quite late the first night and was given a room at the very end of the hall; it was a smoking room, despite having requested a non-smoking room through Expedia. There were no more non-smoking rooms available that night. However, the front desk called the following morning by 8 am to let me know a non-smoking room had become available for me.The rooms here are definitely small, but it also seems to be dependent on where the room is located. My first double was so small that the bathroom door, room door, and closet door all opened into the same space, but my second double was quite comfortable, albeit still on the smaller side. Cable TV is a plus, as well as the complimentary wireless Internet access (which, incidentally, may vary in signal from essentially nonexistent to reasonably strong.)A significant perk of the hotel is the complimentary refillable water bottle dispenser near the elevators on each floor. These are plastic sealed bottles which can be opened and filled with cold filtered water. Another perk is the club room on the ground floor, where I was able to use the complimentary computers with Internet access and also print documents, including ones that I sent to the printer via laptop while in my hotel room and then used a unique document code to print out once I was down in the club room.It was about a 10 min walk to the Moscone Center from the hotel and about 3 min walk to Chinatown. The nearest BART station was about 5 min away, even with luggage. I would easily choose to stay at this hotel again."
58,2031,"Oct 28 2007 	Do not fall for this trap! Not worth 3.5 stars!	Booked this hotel via Hotwire since the price was OK for a stay in San Francisco. The hotel was rated as a 3.5 star equivalent to a Hilton. I was a bit apprehensive at check in due to mitigated reviews I had read. Although the hotel is clean (the least really you expect), this is in no means comparible to a 3.5 star rating Hotwire has. The rooms are small and only have twin beds or a single queen. As mentioned in other reviews, the accoustics are pretty bad. Although the hotel was fairly fully booked when I stayed we thankfully had quiet neighbours, but indeed the least amount of talking in the hallway can be heard in the rooms. The beds are more military style with the actual cover that doubles as blanket, which I doubt if cleaned after every guest. Ammenities are a pure minimum, If you do not care giving in on quality of your stay, this is probably a decent choice. But please do not let the star rating fool you, this hotel is certainly not worth more then a 2.5 star rating!"
59,2031,"Oct 19 2007	disappointed with stay	Not sure why this hotel is ranked so high on the list. the hotel itself seems okay but the room i stayed in was absolutely tiny and i kept mistaking the bathroom for a closet. the area is convenient in that it is near the bart but is otherwise not in a particularly desirable area and does not have any good restaurants close by. it was incredibly cramped, the staff were not helpful, and i certainly would not stay there again."
60,2031,"Oct 12 2007 	Wonderful location and perfect long weekend hotel	My husband and I stayed at Club Quarters San Francisco for a long weekend and we highly recommend this hotel for its location, nightly rates, and it is also well maintained. We are seasoned travelers and we were at first uncertain about staying in a smaller scale hotel, but it was a pleasant surprise and we'll definitely stay there again when we visit San Francisco in the future!"
61,2031,"Oct 9 2007 	Great value	My thoughts based on other reviews here.... I stay in SF about 10-12 times a year, so I'm familiar with the Kimpton hotels, etc.Couldn't stay at any of my regular places because I was only there one night (on a Friday) and all were either booked or required a Saturday night stay. It was fleet week (unbeknownst to me) so the city was incredibly busy.Rooms seem to be average in size. What the place lacks in personality it completely makes up for in business amenities. I especially like the fact that I can order from numerous local restaurants via room service. Also like that I requested an early check-in (arrived at 1PM) and they were able accomodate. There are also levels of late check out that you can pay for, which is a life saver for those who may need to leave town late but want to grab a shower or a nap on the way out. Location is good if you need to be in the Embarcadero or Financial Districts, but you'll need to take a cab to get to most other places. It's central, s not more than 5 minutes from most destinations like Union Square, Nob Hill, etc.Only real problem is that getting a cab quickly in this location is not easy. Plan on walking a few blocks or have the front desk call ahead. Overall the service was as good or better than I've experienced at other higher end boutique hotels in SF."
62,2031,"Sep 24 2007	Small Rooms but Convenient Location	I was looking for a cheap 3 star in the city and Hotwire gave me CQ for $99 a night. I was very happy about this deal until I called the hotel and found out parking would cost $33 a day nearby. Oh well, that's the big city for you! Us country bumpkins from the OC just ain't used to payin' to park our tractor of an SUV!Rooms are small but clean and comfy. Perks include free wi-fi and bottled water. There's also a laundry and a gym with weights. A British-style pub and Starbucks are right next door. Pro: Walking distance to the Ferry station, Embarcadero Center, Cable Car station, and Chinatown. Con: Few staff members in lobby as it's expected that you check-in and out by yourself. No bathtub. Trivia: When the hotel was being built, the crew found a Gold Rush- era trading ship buried underneath! Huzzah!"
63,2031,"Sep 23 2007 	good value in SF	The hotel is located next to Le Meridian hotel in the financial district. It is very quiet there on the weekend and everything is near if you are a good walker: 45 mins to Pier 33 or 30 mins to Union Square. I got a queen room shower stall only for $130 (no view, very business like in the room). For the price, I highly recommend if you are visiting to see the city. The room is not for a romantic weekend or an anniversary."
64,2031,"Sep 20 2007 	Smart hotel good location	We stayed here on the first night of our holiday in the US having flown from the UK. Having been to San Francisco before and simply using it as an entry point to the US, we simply wanted a comfortable easy to reach hotel where we could sleep off the jetlag!Club Quarters was very reasonably priced for central San Francisco, and it's easily reached from SFO using the BART to Embarcadero station, which is five mins walk from the hotel. Cable car lines are also nearby and Union square is 10-15 minutes walk.The room was smallish but fine for the two of us for one night., the bed was comfortable and the shower adequate. The front desk staff were helpful and efficient.The only downside we had was that our room was as far from the elevator as it is possible to get, right round the other end of the building, which meant it took a while to get to and from the room. Also the wi-fi signal wasn't very strong - i wonder if that was due to the room location.For the amount paid (about $100), this is a decent stopping point in SF."
65,2031,"Sep 19 2007 	Great for single business travelers...	I had a pleseant stay at the Club Quarters. The hotel itself was a 15 minute walk from the Embacadero BART stop, which was a $5.15 dollar ride from the airport. It was very close to Chinatown and Union Square with the Wharf relatively close (20-ish minute walk). The actual hotel was nice. The rooms were tiny, but they were very clean and modern. The bed was comfortable and the wireless internet was excellent. They have three computers in the lobby with internet/printers, a nice gym and a little observation deck at the top floor with a view of the San Fran skyline. Room service was very nice and the front desk staff were professional and very accomodating. The front desk staff is excellent, and went out of their way to help me when I had a sticky situation. When I return, I will definately be staying there again!"
66,2031,"Sep 16 2007	Liked my stay but would recommend that travelers keep looking	The biggest downside is that I would have preferred to stay somewhere closer to the BART station. That said, the hotel stay itself was nice. We had a small but cozy room. Average for what one would expect from a business traveler's hotel."
67,2031,"Sep 12 2007	Excellent Hotel	This is a great hotel in an excellent location! Everything you need is within easy walking distance including a large supermarket. Excellent restaurants are also close by. The rooms are very nice and although on the small side, they are average in size for San Francisco. The lobby is a real plus as it is very large and a very comfortable reading or lounging area. Coffee is provided in the morning as is many newspapers and magazines. A large screen TV is also available plus 3 free computers with printing capability. I read all of the previously written reviews and was concerned about some of the negative comments about the hotel staff. And of course some of the staff was better than others but on average they were very helpful and courteous. Peter was the best at helping with restaurant recommendations.You can't go wrong with this hotel."
68,2031,"Sep 4 2007 	Affordable and Great place	We stayed in club quarters during labor day week end. The hotel and location was just great.. Every thing is so close by.The Embcardo center is just opposite the hotel, which has couple of good places to eat. Easy to get cabs, munis etc. Union square is about 15 min walk, China town is very close by. The location just rocks!!!. The rooms were neat.. bit tiny.. But we hardly spent time.... No complaints!!!!! and of course Affordable when compared to other hotels aroundl...."
69,2031,"Aug 30 2007 	Nice affordable choice	Found a great deal online for this property, as it was much cheaper than others in the area. Room was setup for business as is mentioned in earlier reviews. Not a big deal. Everything seemed to be in nice shape. Bathroom was a bit cramped and tv was a bit small, but it wasn't a big issue. I wasn't planning on sitting in the room much anyway! Found the front desk/check in to be extremely easy and quick. Top marks for this."
70,2031,"Aug 24 2007 	Nice hotel lacks customer service.	After having stayed at the Club Quarters in Rockefeller Center, we decided to try our luck at the one in San Fran. We really enjoyed our time in the New York hotel, and thought that this experience would be similar. The hotel itself was not as impressive as their New York branch, but the stay itself was pleasant, no complaints about noise or the room.However, the main reason we booked a stay here was for the weekend 'deal' available to CQ Member company employees. The advertised rate was 69 dollars a night for Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. We booked about 2 months in advance to ensure we would be able to get the special rate. My boyfriend spoke on the phone with their main booking agency and they were very helpful, but told us that there was a special event going on Saturday evening, so that we would not be able to recieve the discounted rate that night. We were OK with that, but the rate was expected to jump to around $130 for that one evening. However, upon checking out, serious flaws in their &quot;seamless check-in/check-out&quot; was made apparant. The most serious problem I see with the electronic check in check out that they have is that their staff is totally un-oriented with their own hotel policies when a problem arises!! We checked out electronically, and our reciept was for 450 dollars, and had quoted totally wrong prices for each night. The staff we discussed our problem with was friendly, but had no idea that they even OFFERED a special rate to corporate members on the weekends. He seemed to think that we should have been paying more on a weekend, and was totally confused with something that is clearly displayed all over their website. Frankly, I was extremly upset, since we had stayed in the financial district on a weekend -- obviously not the most exciting place to stay in the city, but we had done it for the special price. We could have stayed somewhere nicer, with close attractions, not payed a lot for cabs, if we had known earlier that we would not indeed, be recieving a special price. We even showed the clerk our confirmation that quoted the prices we would be paying. He said that prices were subject to change based on room availablility. That's pretty much BS, since you can't charge someone MORE for a service once they've booked it. The whole experience left a very bad taste in my mouth, and I found it insulting that if you went to the clerk for check-in/check-out, they directed you to their electronic machines for check in. The Motel 6 will personally check me in, but not a hotel room that I end up paying 160 dollars for?! Come on Club Quarters, have some class."
71,2031,"Aug 3 2007	Great stay !	Great location, easy walk to the embarcadero where you can walk along the piers with views of the bay or catch a trolley to Fishermans wharf. Also short walk to Chinatown, a little longer but still mostly flat to North Beach for Beach Blanket Babylon &amp; tons of great restaurants as well as a few jazz clubs. I spent 3 nights here with my teenage daughter &amp; was totally comfortable walking around late at night, even though the area is on the quiet side. Rooms were small but adequate, bottled water available in the hall &amp; ice in lower level made lack of refrigerator a non-issue .We both appreciated the public use computers in the lobby for directions, checking flight status, &amp; e-mail. It was an easy walk to Bart station &amp; from there to SFO. Front desk was very helpful &amp; offerred directions &amp; maps readily.Overall I would recommend this no frills hotel highly."
72,2031,"Aug 3 2007 	Great location 	My husband chose this hotel because of the location-he ran the SF Marathon and wanted a place close to the start of the race. We arrived early, and thought we would have to leave our bags and explore the city until 3pm check-in time, but Shawn was able to check us in immediately. We asked for a fridge for my husband's medication, but none were available, we were told to check back. Later, Peter was extremely helpful in relocating us to a room with a refrgerator, and even gave us a complimentary breakfast for the trouble. The hotel room was extremely clean, and so convenient to everything--tons of restaurants, Starbucks, etc... It's in a good part of SF, so we felt safe. The complimentary bottled water was great, but they need to consider recycling receptacles for the discarded bottles--that's a lot of plastic.We would absolutely highly recommend this hotel to anytone traveling to the Bay area. Yes, the rooms may feel small, but are spotless and while you're in the city-don't spend so much time in the room! The hotel staff was top notch, we loved San Francisco, and the hotel was a big part of it!"
73,2031,"Jul 3 2007 	Great Stay at Club Quarters	I spent three nights over a weekend at the Club Quarters San Francisco and had a great experience. The room was clean, comfortable, and very nicely furnished. The property is a bit different from other hotels. The hotel isn't set up for every feature to be a profit center and there are good deal more self-service options than you would find at a comparable property. The room was not the most generously sized, and might have been an issue if I were on a business trip where I was doing a great deal of work in my room. For my purposes, however, (a place to sleep and relax) it worked very well. There was a bit of a noise issue as others have mentioned, but nothing that interrupted my sleep at all. Also, the bathroom only has a stall shower, not a bathtub, so if that's an issue this may not be the place for you.The room had a good desk with plenty of available light, outlets available at the work station, and two phones in the room, one of which was cordless. Each room has its own direct-dial phone number, which is a nice feature.Vending and the ice machine are located on the lower level along with the fitness center (treadmill, stationary bike, and a rack of dumbells) and complimentary guest laundry facility. The ground floor features three computers with high speed internet access, a complimentary guest print me printing station, a nice guest lounge and the check-in desk. Each floor has a water dispenser with empty bottles for complimentary chilled water. Most of the stuff one would expect to pay for at this level of property (internet, laundry, printing, etc.) is provided at no charge, but the trade-off is the self-service nature of much of the facility, including self-service check-in and check-out. That being said, any time I had a question the folks at the front desk were great and very helpful! The location is accessible to many of the tourist areas on foot or via a short cab ride. It's also within blocks of a BART station for service to SFO or OAK airports. If you're on an expense account and looking for all of the 4-star bells and whistles this might not be the best option, but if you're looking for good quality accommodations, great service, and if you're a bit flexible, this is a great place to stay! I plan to stay here again when I return to the City."
74,2031,"Jun 8 2007 	Wonderful! - some advice	My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon in May. We went ahead and went with the upgrade to a queen sized bed, which is still a great deal! The room was a bit small, but not as bas as I had imagined it by reading other reviews. The bed was really comfotable and the staff kept the room very clean. We thought it was awesome that they offered unlimited, free, filtered water, along with bottles to put it in. We saved a lot of money because of the water. We would each fill up a bottle before going out to site see and it would last us pretty much all day. Another great thing about the hotel was the 11th floor sun deck. After a long day of site seeing, we would go up there and relax and just take in the view. The security is great! You feel very safe because you need your key if you want to go anywhere in the hotel. We loved it!The location is perfect. China town is about 3 blocks away and the all the bus stops were very close so we saw everything we wanted to see. The restaurant that is attached, called Elephant &amp; Castle is pretty good! They have a pool table and lounge area downstairs. A little piece of advice...the best thing we did was buy city passes. You get unlimited city transportation and if you buy the $54 pass, it includes admission many museums, the aquarium, a bay cruise, and much more. Our honeymoon was wonderful and we will definately stay at Club Quarters when we return."
75,2031,"May 19 2007	Try it for yourself.	In early May I stayed for two weekend nights so got a great rate... $62 pn. I had read a number of reviews here so was prepared for noise and a small room. Perhaps because of that expectation I was very pleasantly surprised: no noise at all and the room was more than adequate for one or two people who are not planing to live in the room. The free wireless connection was great and the desk in the room was perfect for laptop use. The plastic bottles and cold water in the corridor are a real bonus. Check in was easy and despite arriving at noon I was able to move in to the room immediately. Clean, comfortable, central... all very good and I doubt you'll beat the value for money."
76,2031,"May 14 2007	Loud A/C	The hotel staff was great. We arrived early before 1100 AM and immediately had a room. The room was small more for business but we weren't in it very often. The room was very, very clean and looked remodeled, however ours had a shower only. Great location for sure if you plan on walking alot or going public transpo. Our room's A/C woke us up a few times but if you can stand traffic noise then open the window. They have a really neat water machine at the end of the hallway and a pretty decent pub next door. I reccommend this hotel for those who need to budget somewhat."
77,2031,Apr 15 2007	One of the BEST !!!!	They went out of their way to recommend restaurants within walking distance of the hotel . We had a family member stayingat a hotel in a city nearby and they made arrangements for themto and from our hotel. The staff was beyond friendly almostlike family. The food in the restaurant at the hotel was very good.We will be staying at this hotel in the future. The rooms seem to be smaller than average but was perfect for two people.
78,2031,"Mar 16 2007 	Great Rates	My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Club Quarters, however, be advised that the standard rooms are too small for two people for a stay of more than a few nights. For San Francisco, you can't beat the rates, though, and the rooms, while small, are new and clean. We stayed 5 nights so we took advantage of the laundry room in the basement, which is where the ice and vending machines were located as well. My wife is disabled and in a wheelchair full time. We found the accessible bathroom to be excellent with a roll-in shower and an ADA toilet with grab bars. Also, the sink was elevated for wheelchair patrons. Strangely, the accessible rooms were located at the far end of the hallways, once you leave the elevator lobby so, if you're traveling with a walker or someone using a cane, beware. In addition, since the room was a too small for two people, we tried to upgrade to a larger room but the only accessible rooms are the standard ones. The hotel is across the street from the Embarcadero, which harbors shopping such as Banana Republic, Victoria's Secret and other mainstream stores. An ATM is located in the first set of buildings facing the hotel. The hotel does not have an ATM. In addition, there is a Tony Roma's there and a Chevy's, if you're desperate. Otherwise, you can try Schroeder's restaurant, an old German restaurant dating back to 1893, which is a few blocks away on Front Street. Also on Front Street is the Irish bar Harrington's. If you want to venture out, try Scoma's down in Fisherman's Wharf. The prices are too high but it's fun to eat by the water and the food is good.In closing, the Club Quarters is great for the lone business traveler. Upgrade to the bigger room if you're traveling with two or more people and, if you have disabilities, call in advance to quiz them on the room. Perhaps they have some that are closer to the elevators."
79,2031,"Mar 2 2007	Very clean and comforable	The Club Quarters gives you a very inexpensive, but still clean and comfortable option in San Francisco's financial district. Picture a corporate dorm--the rooms are a bit smaller than your typical business hotel, but are very clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower is a small alcove off the small bathroom (no tub), but the water pressure was fine and it got the job done. Other than some doors closing in the hallway, the room was pretty quiet.The location is convenient to the downtown landmarks--it's about a 25-minute walk to Moscone Center (it's all flat). My conference didn't offer shuttle service directly to Club Quarters, but I was able to catch buses back to nearby hotels. And it's across the street from Le Meriden, so you can get a cab there if you need one. Parking is around the corner at the Embarcadero Center for about $30 a day--not sure if there are cheaper options in the neighborhood or not. I didn't check out the attached restaurant, Elephant and Castle, but some local friends had eaten there and said it was pretty good. Overall, Club Quarters is a nice choice, and well worth the bargin price."
80,2031,"Feb 6 2007 	Great location VERY clean and quite cozy	We went to San Francisco on business and stayed at Club Quarters on Clay Street for 2 nights. We arrived and found our room ready as promised -- clean and well appointed. The rooms are smaller than your run-of-the-mill room, but it felt cozy to me.The linens were spotless and the pillows were divine. The bath was smaller than most but well laid out with ample shelving/counter space. I really enjoyed the non-tub shower; it was all-tile with silver fixtures and a very adjustable shower head with wonderful water pressure (rare in bay area hotels sometimes). There was also a nice large mirror with great lighting for getting ready.I know others who have stayed here mentioned that their room's window didn't open, but ours did and it was great to be able to let the bay breeze and watch the bustle on the street below. Maybe just ask the desk clerk if you prefer a room with an operable window?The small sun deck on the 11th floor had a great view in both day and night, it was an enjoyable place to sit and relax."
81,2031,"Jan 22 2007 	Great Value/Great Location/No problems	We stayed here for 5 nights in January for around $90 a night. The location is terrific. It is close to several restaurants, 2 wine bars, a movie theatre complex and within short (relatively flat) walking distance to many of the major sites. We avoided the attached restaurant, but walked to other options within 0-3 blocks. Our room was modestly furnished but it emphasized the clean feeling of the space. The free internet access was very convenient as were the various newspapers available in the main floor lounge. We received polite service including the arrangement of transportation to the airport. The hotel is across the street from the Le Meridien, so if you need a taxi or a fancy restaurant, you can catch it there. The walls are thin but we didn't hear much except for the door--2 door rooms are arranged right next to each other in an entry &quot;alcove&quot;. We will return on our nexxt visit."
82,2031,"Jan 17 2007 	Great place good service nice people	I usually stay at Club Quarters Embarcadero when visiting San Francisco. I lived in SF for 15 years and so know the city well and like the location, which is downtown. Very safe, clean and convenient. But, ready yourself for it being quiet (not festive) at night. (Another thing I like about it.) However, it is near BART transport and an easy walk to North Beach and Union Square. The rooms are very comfortable, not fancy but have everything you need and well appointed. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They have free computer access and coffee in the sitting room, with CNN on the TV. The only black mark is the restaurant/bar. Just don't go there - bad food, too expensive, poor service. Use their in-room fridge and buy breakfast in advance, using the in-room coffee maker. Also, get their advance rate by booking early, which I usually get at around $110 per night, incredible for SF."
83,2031,"Jan 16 2007 	Far exceeded expectations	I've been traveling to San Francisco on business for roughly seven years and have stayed at a large variety of hotels there. This my my first time at the Club Quarters and I was a bit leery due to the rate of $89. Wow was I impressed! This hotel was much better than many of the boutiques I've stayed in and even some of the well-known historic hotels in the city. The room was small and only a double bed, but I did expect that. It's the perfect place for a business travel -- very close to Market Street (and even a Starbucks a mere 20 feet away). The one suggestion I have is to bring your own shampoo, conditioner, etc."
84,2031,Jan 15 2007 	Excellent Place to Stay!	The ease of check in and check out was superb! The dollar value for the room was excellent! The location was great!
85,2031,Jan 7 2007 	Great location good value.	Safe and ideal location for a vacation to San Fran. The free internet computers in the lobby was a nice perk. The only drawback was that the walls are very thin and the rooms are close together...so if you are a light sleeper this may be a problem.
86,2031,"Jan 5 2007	Most basic business hotel	Stayed here a while ago. Room is small but clean. Window faces the wall! Restaurant breakfast is so so. The only great point about the hotel is free internet.Okay, one more great thing was on the following day when I needed to catch a cab to a business as well as later on needed another cab to go to a different hotel, they had a town car waiting for me as complimentary! Of course when I needed to go to the airport a few days later I called for the service and gave them a big tip!!"
87,2031,"Sep 8 2006 	No complaints	This is a no-frills but clean, modern and comfortable hotel clearly designed for the business traveler -- the male business traveler. Room decor, colors used, furniture, bathroom, etc., were very masculine, but nice. I don't know if they're all this way, but ours had a shower stall only. The hair dryer was the small, wall-mounted type. One major recommendation I would make to women staying here is to definitely bring your own toiletries. Rooms were smallish, but my husband and I did not feel cramped in the least. In fact, I was impressed with how space-efficient this hotel was. Why do you really need tons of floor space in a place where most of the time you're there you're in bed asleep? I was concerned about the noise problem other reviews here mentioned. I specifically asked for a quiet room and got it. I did hear room doors opening and closing, but that's it. I guess I lucked out. One little bennie we discovered: a computer and printer in the lobby we used at no extra cost. Great for printing out our Southwest boarding passes! Enjoyed our one night and would stay there again."
88,2031,"Sep 5 2006	Great hotel location and amenities	Club Quarters San Francisco is a great travellers hotel. The hotel is clean and modern. There is free high-speed internet access (you can bring your own lap top or there are computers downstairs in the common area.) The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was a bit small, but my fiancee and I are both over 6ft tall, and we never felt cramped or in each others way. Check-in was a breeze, and the staff was excellent. I actually saw one of the desk attendants walking a party from the hotel around the financial district to help them find a place to eat on labor day eve...talk about service!!! The room had a microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker. (I'm not sure if all do, so you may need to request.) In addition to all of this, there is a gym with some pretty decent equipment and a roof-top deck w/ somewhat restricted views of the bay. I read some negative reviews about the location, and I'm not sure what those people are smoking. The hotel is about 3 blocks outside of North Beach. It is also about 5 blocks form market street, along which there is access to muni, bart, busses and ferries. In my opinion, that's a damn fine location. Booked a last minute trip to San Francisco for labor day weekend. I am not sure of the exact price that was paid for the hotel as it was a package deal, but based upon my guesstimation and arithmatic, it was probably around $65-$75 per night....an absolute steal for this beautiful city."
89,2031,"Aug 25 2006 	great hotel at a great location	I was very happy with the location, very close to china town and also to the embarcadero. We walked to dinner most nights in chinatown and little italy. I was a little worried when I saw the reviews saying that the rooms were small, I can tell that the people who wrote them never stayed in new york city hotels because our room was twice the size of the average hotel room in nyc. The room was clean and more than enough space for two people. I was also happy that we did not have the homeless people hanging out near the hotel like many of the other hotels had. I felt secure here."
90,2031,"Jul 21 2006	I left my love in San Francisco	We stayed three days in San Francisco . It was the first time I visit that beautiful city with my boyfriend. We visit Fisherman Wharf, Cliff House, Planetarium, Mission Street, Downtown, Chinatown. It is a big city with so many places to go nearby. We visit Berkely, Oakland and Sausalito , too. We took also a Golden Bridge tour. We keep the Alcatraz tour for a second visit. We spent two night at the Hyatt Regency in Burlingame and one night at the Club Quarters. The first hotel is big and confortable with a beautiful view of the bay. The second is an ideal hotel at downtown, everything is near!!!! I strongly recommed these hotels, they are not expensive, 3 star hotels and extremely clean and comfortable."
91,2031,"Jun 25 2006	EXTREMELY THIN WALLS!	Club Quarters is a hotel chain that contracts with large companies for discount hotel stays during the week. On the weekends, they lift their &quot;private club&quot; restriction and allow other travellers to stay at relatively inexpensive rates.We found that this Club Quarters, in San Francisco, is in the financial district - a great location for business travellers during the week, but on the weekend the entire neighborhod is completely dead. The hotel has no parking at all. Guests are instructed to park at a pay garage around the corner - for $28/day. So much for saving money on the hotel. Our other complaint was that the walls are paper-thin. Other reviewers have mentioned that there seemed to be a party going on all night in the hallway, and this was definitely our experience. If you're looking for a party atmosphere at 2 am in a low-cost hotel, this is the place! But if you were hoping to get some sleep, you're out of luck. In addition to screaming, yelling, laughing, and slamming doors, we could also easily hear &quot;normal&quot; noises (tv, talking, flushing toilets) from the rooms on either side, above, and below us."
92,2031,"May 30 2006	It's only business	CQ bills itself as a business hotel, and it is that, but nothing more. Most of the rooms are VERY small, with double beds, small bathrooms and only one hand-towel. We spent one night in a room that was more like a cell--its window looked out at a bare concrete wall just 3 feet away. And it reeked of tobacco! But the second night we were moved to a much larger room on the top floor, with great views, and no smell. On the holiday weekend we were there, most of the patrons were foreign tourists and youf couples. We had no issues with noice. Being in the financial district, there was always street parking available, which saves about $35/night."
93,2031,"May 24 2006 	OK Place - Be Sure That You Like the Neighbors in the Next Room	Stayed here April 30 - May 3 as a good alternative to the Hyatt down the street, where my meeting was located. The place is nice and the room is adequate for a single traveler. The savings averaged $50 per night over the Hyatt. However, the walls are so thin that you can hear the TV and the conversation of the people in the next room. Be sure that you like them, because you will hear everything that they have to say."
94,2031,"May 23 2006	Good hotel great location	I just got back from a trip to San Francisco and a stay at Club Quarters. I found the previous reviews to be very helpful. It was in a great location and the room was fine - clean and met our needs. I agree they were a little skimpy with the bathroom towels, but immediately brought up a couple more when I requested them. We had to find an blanket in the guest closet in the hallway (the bed only had the top sheet and bedspread on it) - which was fine; I just hope they clean those blankets regularly! The staff was easy to deal with and allowed us to have a late checkout, which we needed. The only real complaint I have is with the parking - parking is at the Embarcadero Center garage, which is fine, but expensive. Even with the parking expense, it was still cheaper to stay here than anywhere else downtown. I didn't have any trouble with &quot;thin&quot; walls, but I travel with a white noise machine anyway since I'm a light sleeper. I also liked the free internet access - helped with getting directions to places outside of the city and just to check on a few things. All in all, I would defintely stay at Club Quarters again."
95,2031,"Apr 26 2006 	Staff Needs Friendliness Training!	I spent four nights at the Club Quarters in April 2006. I arrived at 1:30 (after a long flight from the East Coast) and was told that check-in time was at 3 - ergo, room not ready. Fine. I had a nice lunch in the adjoining restaurant. Came back at 2:45 or so. Nope - room not ready. Went for a walk down by the Bay. Returned at 3:30. The desk staffer, a young woman of Asian heritage, was extremely rude in informing me that the room was still not ready. Funny, don't I start paying for the room at 3 pm? I must say that the young man who had to inform me of the room not being ready the first two times was very helpful and professional. The young lady, however, could not have cared less that I had to sit around waiting for my room. This was NOT a good way to welcome a first-time visitor, and certainly doesn't make me want to direct return business to this hotel. Too bad for them, as I was here specifically seeking a location for extensive group business. As for the room, it was sort of small, there were not enough pillows, and they're sort of skimpy on towels and bathroom accessories. And, yes - very thin walls! The bed was extremely comfortable, however, and the water pressure in the shower was absolutely wonderful. The hotel is also in a great location."
96,2031,"Mar 13 2006	Good deal for the Price	Spent two nights in San Francisco and went for this hotel as its cost was competitive in comparison to most of the other San Francisco hotels and in a decent safe area.The rooms were smaller than a standard room in the US but were very clean and still large enough for two sharing.The staff were helpful and courteous and the free internet access is a bonus.For a tourist wishing to get around the city, the hotel is slightly out of the way from the main sites as it is in the business area but Fishermans Wharf was walkable and took approx. 20 minutes. Most areas were between $5-10 dollars to get to in a cab and the Embarcadero centre is right across the street for those of you looking to shop.The pub next door was pretty good for a drink although the food was not that great. Traditional English Fayre but lacking in flavour. Having said that, if you are jetlagged and in want of something on the doorstep it would suffice and again staff were friendly and helpful.I would be happy to stay here again if visiting S.F. although a hotel more central to the main tourist areas would be preferable id they could match the price."
97,2031,"Feb 23 2006	Nice cozy place	Nice, cozy place, right by the financial district. It's also a short cab ride to downtown, Little Italy, and Fisherman's Wharf. Chinatown is walking distance, but you do have to climb hills! It's nice little place, I would stay there again."
98,2031,"Feb 20 2006	Great Accomadations - As Usual	This place is a great place to stay if you want a location where you have access to all the sights and sounds of San Francisco. Three blocks from Chinatown, Two blocks from the Famous Cable Cars and Four blocks from BART and a heafty walk to Pac-Bell SBC (AT&amp;T) Ballpark. My girlfriend and I took our three grown children for the Chinese New Year's Celebration weekend, and were able to walk back after all the festivities without having to fight the massive crowds. The next day, we hopped on the cable car to ride down to Fishermans Wharf for sour dough bread, clam chowder, chocolate and to see the Sea Lions at Pier 39. Then we took the other line back up to Chinatown for &quot;dim sum&quot; and walked down to catch BART to go under the trans-Bay tunnel. This place is a private, members only establishment during the business week because its in the heart of the business/financial district. But on the weekends its open to those who know about it. Rooms are neat and clean but a little small for a family trip (that's why we needed two rooms), but the location is worth the cramped space (esp. if all you need is a place to sleep.) Parking is $28.50 per day in the Embarcadero Center underground garage, but the security is really good there."
99,2031,"Jan 20 2006	Great Hotel for Business in the Financial District	My stay at the Club Quarters San Francisco was great and exactly what I hoped and expected. The hotel was booked solid when I arrived, fortunately I made reservations ahead of time. Due to the solid booking I was upgraded to a suite! The location is best for those traveling to San Francisco on business, particularly if your meetings are in the financial district. I walked to every meeting and only needed to take BART twice to get to and from SFO. For those with good health and light luggage, it is an easy 4 or 5 block walk from the BART Embarcadero stop. If you enjoy running - the hotel is two blocks to the Embarcadero drive, allowing you to run along the bay.Each room has free and easy internet access too - a huge plus for the business traveler. All was clean and aestetically pleasing, comfortable bed.Attached to the hotel is the Elephant &amp; Castle restaurant which makes eating easy when you are too tired to go out and find something. The restaurant is open for three meals."
100,2031,"Nov 16 2005	good value for the money	I stayed here on a weekend at a discounted/weekend rate for government employees. The hotel is in the Financial District, so it is not as close to the tourist stuff as Union Square. If you are familiar with the MUNI bus system it is not that big a deal-- as you can get away from the area fairly easy. Not the Ritz-Carlton, but a good value for the money. Internet in the lobby was good. My one person room had a shower but no tub. It would be nice if one could serve croissants with the morning coffee, but I guess they wanted to promote the elephant and castle pub next door. Unlike other budget hotels, there was a temperature control in my room. I would stay again for the weekend rates."
101,2031,"Nov 15 2005	Better than Expected	I did not know what to expect after all the reviews. However, after staying there this past weekend for the Cal-USC game, I can say this was a lot better than I would have imagined.The place was very clean and was roomier than expected. Yes, the TV was nothing special, but I can watch TV in the bar downstairs.The place was very modern, free internet, and very clean. It reminded me very much of the HOTEL at Mandalay Bay - not that big and without the flat panel TVs."
102,2031,"Nov 9 2005	A great room	I moved here to find a cheaper location in SF. It's a little claustrophobic compared to the posh high end hotels, but I find it sort of 'european'..an economy of space. My room had everything i needed, desk, office chair, easy chair, and a very comfortable bed. The shower is walk in w/ a hand held spray, very nice!My only complaint is windows you cannot open, and a very lint/dust clogged AC filter. Security is nice, requiring a room key to use the elevator. And my favorite thing, free use of computers in the lobby. They also provide coffee maker in room and in lobby. and a nice place in the lobby to sit, read, watch tv. I highly recommend it."
103,2031,"Nov 8 2005	Great Value and location...but	..as just about everyone here has mentioned, the walls are paper thin...my boyfriend and I felt like we were sleeping with the couple next door. Definitely bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper."
104,2031,"Nov 1 2005	Average quality but nice	The Club Quarters Hotel in San Francisco is a little bit hard to review. It has qualities of both a business hotel and a budget motel.Physically, the rooms are very small, but very clean. They are well appointed, but with the quality of linens you would expect to find at a Motel 6. The bathroom is the smallest Ive ever seen in a hotel. The hallways of the property are very narrow with low ceilings, so it's a bit clausterphobic, if that kind of thing bothers you. I could hear every conversation and person going by in the hallway, but could not hear from other rooms, so thin doors, thick walls.The lobby area is a nice area to relax in and is well appointed. The facility is clean throughout. The location is right in the heart of the financial district, so it is very good for business travelers. MUNI and BART are a few blocks away. I would stay here if traveling alone, and maybe as a couple if you dont mind being in cramped quarters. This hotel would be better than any 2* hotel in the city, likely at a similar price. It is hard to describe, but picture Motel 6 making an attempt at an upscale property - clean and well-appointed with cheap material."
105,2031,"Oct 25 2005	Small Efficient GREAT PUB downstairs!!	My husband and I travelled to San Francisco for the Nike Women's Marathon Oct 22-24 and stayed at the CQ for 2 nights. We had two rooms, and although I requested adjoining rooms when I made the reservation, when we checked in, we were unable to get them. Instead, we were given rooms that were sort of across the hall from each other. The hotel is located across from the embarcadero center, so we spent a lot of time walking through the shops and just enjoying the sights and sounds.The hotel is clean and nice. The front desk was friendly and check in/out was a breeze.The rooms were definitely small. They weren't as tiny as I'd feared, but the smaller of the two rooms we had was not something I would choose to stay in again. There are either two twin beds in the room or one queen- much smaller than most of us are used to.The door to the bathroom was odd- even fully shut, it had a noticeable gap that you could see through, or worse, smell through... sorry to be graphic, but this is a terrible feature of this hotel. This hotel is definitely geared toward the business crowd, with high speed internet free in the rooms, as well as internet on tv for a fee. I would think if a businessperson had a co-worker/client/etc to their room the bathroom door would be a real inconvenience. did i mention the bathroom doors need to be replaced?!I also was disappointed in the walls. They were very thin, and when the person in the next room didn't shut off his alarm clock for 30 seconds at 4:50am, I got the pleasure of lying awake listening to him get up, take his shower, and get ready for his day. I had my 18mo son in the room with me, and I can only imagine his crying in the night must've interrupted our neighbors' sleep as well. Also, the hotel is literally around the corner from the fire station, so although this is a nice safety feature, be prepared for sirens at all hours-- more sirens than normal, anyway.The bathrooms/bedrooms were very clean, and the showerheads were wonderful. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel if you're travelling on business. Otherwise, I'd suggest something a little more comfortable for a vacation."
106,2031,"Oct 3 2005	Great value very clean	I've stayed at several SF hotels in the past and this is a great hotel for the price. We upgraded our room to a room with a mini fridge. Our room was about the same size as many rooms I've stayed in other SF boutique hotels. So it was small as I expected but comfortable. We had breakfast and dinner once at the Elephant Castle next door. It's a little expensive but it's a good. There are several great sandwich shops around but most are closed on the weekends. We walked 10 min to North Beach for some good italian dinners a few nights. Viva is our favorite for Italian. The Specialty Bakery &amp; Cafe on Sansome St had the best sandwiches and cookies.The area around the hotel is very safe and very quiet on the weekends. The Bart station is just a few blocks away or walking to Union Square, North Beach, Chinatown, etc is about 10-20 min walk.The Club Quarters is a great hotel that fits my budget and we'll be back again soon."
107,2031,Sep 29 2005	Handy hotel in beautiful City	Spent ages on the internet trying to find a suitable place to stay in S.F. Every time we saw something that seemed O.K. the reviews were terrible. Husband had stayed in the Club Quarters in London and a workmate suggested here.Stayed here for 4 nights in Sept. Check-in was slick. We travelled with our daughter and had two rooms they were on the 4th floor in a little corner and we heard a little noise from the street but that's all. The rooms (both slightly different) were O.K. for size. They were clean and well serviced.  Bed was very comfortable. Only downside was that the bed was not properly made. The mattress cover had elastic at corners to fit on to the mattress and this was not secured properly! A quick bed make was all that was necessary. Incidently we stayed in 4 different hotels whilst in the US and the bed was not made properly in any of them. Maybe that's the American way!!We had breakfast in the Elephant and Castle on two mornings and could not fault it.The internet access was great as it meant we could keep in touch with our son easily without having to send expensive text messages.The Club Quarters is in a good location for the Bart system to and from the airport. Also it is an easy flat walk up to pier 39 along Embarcadero. It is not too far to Union Square and Chinatown. All in all we would recommend this as a base whilst in San Francisco.
108,2031,"Sep 15 2005	Great location nice hotel	This hotel was nice, and really met our needs. We traveled to SF for a long weekend to visit my parents. We booked an efficiency queen room, which was nice, because it provided a kitchenette and little extra space. We had no view, which wasn't really a problem since we spent little time in the room.  THe hotel is located in the heart of the Embarcadero in the shadow of the Transamerica Pyramid. It's a great location just a five minute walk to BART and the MUNI subway. It's also walking distance to Chinatown and Jackson Square. We hiked all the way to North Beach, Coit Tower, and Pier 39.  The hotel reminds me of a European hotel more than a standard American hotel. The room was clean, servicable, and nicely decorated. It was also small, and certainly not luxurious. Expect what you would find in a mid-priced, modern Paris chain hotel. The room service was really delivery from the restaurant downstairs, and was very reasonably priced and quick (imagine that in a &quot;regular&quot; hotel) The drawbacks are that the walls are VERY thin. We heard the neighbors, everyone that walked down the hall, and sadly, they were subjected to our baby crying quite a bit. This is not the place to stay if you want quiet. However, if you want a clean, safe, nice place to sleep between excusions into the city, this is a great place to stay. You really can't beat the location or the price. A note for anyone travelling with a baby: bring your own crib. The portable crib they provided was little short of frightening. It was metal and looked like it would collapse at any moment. The sheets and blankets for the crib were stained. Needless to say, we didn't use it."
109,2031,"Aug 24 2005	Great stay ... again	Stayed for the third time this year. Nice, compact room. Very clean and stylish. Comfy bed. Powerful, effective aircon. GREAT free wireless internet access that's easy to access and use. Staff helpful.. open the gym for me at 2am and kept laundry behind front desk so as not to disturb my afternoon sleeping habits. As before I went to the Hyatt for breakfast as it is pretty grim in the hotel's pub/bar. This hotel is great value and real find and would recommend it to anyone on business."
110,2031,"Jul 20 2005 	Club Quarters great value-recommended	Having stayed at the CQ in Chicago (on Wacker Ave) I was glad to find one conveniently located in the Financial District in SF. The rooms are comfortable, well-appointed; guest services were great; nice observation/sun deck in the shadow of the TransAmerica tower.Like other reviewers, I think the whole parking situation needs to be explained or documented better. That was the only reason they didn't earn an &quot;Excellent&quot; from me. I read someone else's account of having difficulty, so I phoned ahead and had them explain it. It was quite easy to stop in front, unload luggage and drive just around the corner to the entry, but the in/out policy, need to prepay and have a yellow slip, discuss the need to keep the slip with the attendant each time...it was a hassle and cost us a bit the first time out because it was not explained when I phoned. I don't usually get a car in SF anyway, so it won't keep me from staying here, but be sure you get the full 4-1-1. Also, no attendant was there Monday morning and we had to exit using the entrance ramp or miss a flight; the posted hours were 5am to ?? but no one there at 5:15 and no one answered the call button."
111,2031,"Jul 18 2005	A++++	I highly recommend anyone working in corporate America to find out if their company partners with Club Quarters! Basically employees like myself are entitled to VERY REASONABLE rates on the weekends in all locations across the USA and in London. I stayed at the Club Quarters San Francisco and the service was great, room was comfortable and clean...all for $114 a night!"
112,2031,"Jul 8 2005	Great for the price!	We too stayed here at the $75 weekend Priceline rate. We got the standard Priceline room - no view and airfreshener obscured smoke. But we'd stay there again at the price. Room was small, but very chicly decorated in spare and clever way. Bed was comfy. Not too soundproof though. We also liked the cool automated check in and out and convenient location. The service didn't dazzle us, but we didn't really require much so it sufficed."
113,2031,"Jul 6 2005	Great Stay!	What a surprise! Hotel is clean and very modern in a cool, business-like way. Front desk was very efficient and helpful with restaurant recommendations and driving directions. Room was clean with decent space for 2 people. The bed was very comfy with crisp sheets. Bathroom was clean with nice towels. Great location...close walk to the Embarcadero and shopping. Many parking garages close-by. If you want breakfast eat at the restaurant downstairs (elephant &amp; castle?)- there aren't many options in the area since it is the financial district but the food is good so you won't be disappointed. The hotel is a great value!"
114,2031,"Jul 4 2005	Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....don't tell anybody!!!	This hotel has to be the best kept secret in town!!!!! The room was great for one....stayed for four nights. It's in a great, safe neighborhood. It's quiet (no street noise). It's very clean. The staff is friendly and accomodating. What more could you want??? What if it's more geared to the business client? What difference does that make? Seems to be more of a plus than a minus to me. One drawback--no tub in the bathroom. Big deal!! I always use a shower anyway. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and I would recommend it unconditionally to anyone!!!"
115,2031,"Jun 12 2005 	Limited Use of Free Stay Coupons	I have been staying at this hotel on and off for 9 months, building up plenty of &quot;night on the house&quot; coupons. I was fine with this as it's a great location, a big enough sized room for one person and relatively cheap compared to other hotels in the financial district. However I when I tried to use my night on the house coupons this month I was informed that they aren't valid for May and June. I will no longer be staying here and will switch to another hotel where I can actually use my points!"
116,2031,"May 17 2005	great hotel	Loved this hotel. Great location, very clean, staff very kind and helpful.Sure the room was small but laid out very efficent. Very secure felt very comfortable and safe staying here.Great balcony on 11th floor with wonderful views of city and bay.Food in adjoining restaurant was excellant, has a huge bar with a pub atmosphere. When we return this is where we will stay."
117,2031,"Apr 25 2005	Fantastic for the price	My wife and I visited San Francisco April 15-18th. We stayed at Club Quarters 2 nights and the Palomar 1 night. Of course the Palomar was more lavishing but you need to determine how much time you actually spend in a hotel room. We are in our mid 30's and travel approximately 2-3 times a year. We like to site see from dawn to dusk and rarely spend much time in the room except to shower and sleep. Although Club Quarters rooms are small, they are extremely, extremely clean. Our room had a modern look to it with a desk and internet access if needed. The bath room is tiny with a stand-up shower (no tub) but like I said, it too was very clean. The walls or floors are thin because we faintly heard a couple somewhere around us. The front desk was very freindly and offered assistance when needed. The cable cars are only 2-3 blocks away and the F-line to Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 is only a 5 minute walk. All in all, for the $75 a night we paid through Priceline, I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
118,2031,"Apr 13 2005	I like it ... but	Hmmm ... this is an interesting and different hotel. Boutiquey and feels small and intimate - but not stupid prices. Very much focussed on the budget business traveller and not really for the family. Positives:Easy, electronic checkin. Nice furnishings, art and touches. Limited gym, but open 24 hours (if you ask), Good shower and basic room amenities ie. TV/Coffee etc.. Unlimited free wireless broadband in room. Very friendly and staff try very hard to accomodate. Location is great. Good value. Powerful aircon for a cold room at night.NegativesNo minibar (vending machines in basement), No Iron or board in room (you have to go to your floor's guest storeroom - where they had run out of irons when I stayed - so grab early!). Rooms are quite small, but actually fine. Walls do seem a little thin - I could hear next door's television. I liked it over all and will definately use the club again."
119,2031,"Apr 7 2005	Nice no-frills hotel	CQ San Francisco is a nice, no-frills hotel. Good location in the financial district - walking distance to attractions and easy access to public transportation. I was familiar with this chain through work (CQ is a business-travel hotel) so I knew to expect small rooms. However, if you're more interested in seeing the city than a posh hotel room this is a great choice. The room was very clean and included a small coffee maker (with all necessary supplies), glasses and coffee mugs. They also have a fitness center and computers with free internet access available for guests' use. All service people I encountered were helpful and courteous. Couldn't beat the price and location."
120,2031,"Apr 5 2005	Stay some where else!	The rooms are very, very small! (My bathroom is bigger) Not a good location for families. There were no in room amenities (glasses, ice bucket, towels, etc.) The parking is not at the hotel and is $30.00 per 24 hour period. The staff is very snotty and not helpful. I would not stay there again and I would not recommend this hotel."
121,2031,"Feb 2 2005	Not Bad	Rooms are small but clean, the staff were not very helpful or knowledgable. No parking for this hotel and they send you to the parking Garage across the street which charges 35.00 a day to park!!! (I almost had a heart attack when I heard that) Located in the financial district, 5 minute walk from China town and about 25 to Fishermans Wharf. Because of the location nothing is open on the weekends, I was shocked to find that even the Starbucks nearby was closed!"
122,2031,"Jan 22 2005	Location... Location... Location.... Parking... NOT!!!!!!!	Well here's the deal. $65.00 per night on Priceline for Jan 14 - 17. Can't beat the price. Paid $115.00 extra (total, not per night) to upgrade to a suite. As I have stayed in the Club Quarters Hotels before, it is VERY NECESSARY to upgrade so that you can turn around in your room without hitting anything. The suite is nice with a full bathroom double/queen bed and refrigerator. The room is well appointed. Wireless or wired broadband is available FREE. PARKING IS IMPOSSIBLE!!! Hotel has a deal with the Embarcadero Center across the street for Garage parking (in and out allowed) but the garage is NOT 24 Hours!!! There are NO 24 HOUR GARAGES around. Meters must be paid every day except Sunday and they start at 7AM. Street parking is available but as I said, the meters start at 7AM and many parking zones with meters are for trucks only during daylight hours. If you are driving or renting a car pay extra and stay somewhere else (Or park across the street at the Park Hyatt at night for about $40.00 for valet (plus tip) - no in and out allowed) and on the street any other time. If you are not driving the hotel is fine. Service is ok. Hotel staff is not very knowledgable about such things as where you can park, etc. Hotel is only a few blocks to the middle of China Town."
123,2031,"Jan 2 2005	Very nice hotel	We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel in Dec 2004. First, let me give a location info for others. This hotel is located in financial district right across a shopping mall called embarcadero. During the weekends and holidays, since all offices are closed, the area is almost empty. It is close to market street. once you get there it is not a problem to get anywhere using MUNI (the name of public transportation). we didn't have any problems with safety during our visit.It seems the hotel is for business people who will stay there for short periods. Yes, the rooms are small as mentioned, but after all how much time will you spend in your room other than sleeping? The room was modern and it was very clean.Staff is friendly. We had a heating problem in our room and someone came promptly and solved the problem.There was a guest closet on the floor which had ironing tables, irons. Also there were tea, coffee bags. There is a coffee machine in each room. Overall we enjoyed our stay."
124,2031,"Dec 10 2004	Not bad at all!	I was pleasantly surprised by club quarters after reading some of these reviews. The hotel was nicely done, the rooms were clean and were not that small at all- but maybe we got lucky. Yes, you probably couldn't open both the front door and the bathroom door at the same time, but why would you need to do that? The room was comfortable, well equipped, nice big bathroom, all in all, GREAT value! My only complaint would be that yes, the walls are pretty thing- you can hear whole conversations, but it was only in the morning, so it didn't really bother us. Great location, nice staff.. would definitely stay here again."
125,2031,"Dec 10 2004 	Clean 	I stayed in a Director category room, equipped with microwave and mini-refrigerator (thankfully not stuffed with expensive liquor and candybars). Other rooms may not have the microwave and refrig. My colleagues and I agreed that the rooms are the cleanest we have ever seen. Ok, the rooms are on the small size, but my room was perfectly fine. A real high-back desk chair, free wireless internet (though frequently very slow). Better to bring (or borrow from the front desk) an ethernet cable to connect to the data port. Warning, internet using the phone line with a dial-up service is not free and can ring up a hefty charge. Ironing boards and other amenities located in the guest closet on each floor. Very tiny excercise room is almost worthless; free weights only, two treadmills, one bike, one eliptical machine. Friendly front desk staff loaned me an umbrella. Located in the heart of the financial district within walking distance of the Ferry Building, Union Square, Chinatown, and Little Italy. BART station 4 short blocks away. California St cable-car line 2 short blocks away. I spent a week in San Franciso on business and enjoyed my stay at the Club Quarters. It is a place to spend the night, not a resort destination. No pool or lush grounds, but a very nice lounge area with two free computers to access the internet if you don't bring your own computer. If you usually stay at the Ritz you won't be happy. If you stay at Holiday Inns, you will love the Club Quarters. I usually stay at Hyatt or Marriott and I was happy here (although if the company would pay for the Park Hyatt across the street I would stay there). Great value!"
126,2031,"Nov 30 2004	Nice Room fine value	I thought the room was very nice, though small. I had to ask for some of the toiletries: lotion, for example, was not in my room to begin with. But overall I liked the hotel. The common room w/ big screen TV and free Internet computers downstairs was a nice amenity. The location was perfect for what I needed (near the Embarcadero Center)."
127,2031,"Oct 26 2004	No Frills!	The adage &quot;You Get What You Pay For&quot; lives on at C.Q. I was excited to stay there after receiving a $75.00 per night rate through HOTWIRE, which identified C.Q. as a 4 star hotel. Although it was obviously a great rate for S.F., do not be fooled by HOTWIRE's rating system. This is no 4 star hotel. The rooms (AND HALLWAYS) are reminiscent of life on a submarine! The rooms are so small, you are unable to have the bathroom door and front door open at the same time, since they will ram into each other. The t.v. set-up reminded me of a hospital room, in which the t.v. is suspended above one's bed by a metal arm. The room service was pathetic. It's offered by an adjacent bar and restaurant and took 45 min. for cold pancakes and bacon Sun. morning. In sum, this is actually a good deal at any rate under $150 night, considering it's located in an excellent spot 2 blocks from the Transamerica Building. However, other than being clean and well kept, there is nothing more to write home about. Definitely not for the claustrophobic!"
128,2031,"Sep 26 2004	Just what we were looking for!	We stayed in CQ Sept. 10 - 12. We had been hiking all week in Yosemite, so it was great to be in such a clean place! The rooms are a bit small, but ours easily accomodated the queen sized bed and our hiking gear. For the price - you can't beat this place! We enjoyed how close it was to everything, and public transportation to those that weren't so close. The afternoon cookies in the lounge were awesome!!!Only complaint - the walls are a bit thin... we had to complain about our noisy neighbors - but one call was all it took to get someone to come and calm them down. We immediately fell back asleep - no harm done.If we go back to SF, we'd definitely stay here again."
129,2031,"Sep 21 2004	More Bang for Your Buck at CQ	My friend and I stayed here on Sept. 11. I personally like the Club Quarters. It's a nice, clean, up-to-date hotel. Being a budget traveler, it is rare that I get to stay somewhere this nice so inexpensively. It was easy to get to Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf from here, and when it was time to go, the BART station was only 2-3 blocks away. I would definitely recommend staying at CQ to anyone traveling to SF, or to any city w/a CQ. The Financial District is quiet on the weekends, but it's easy to travel to other places in the city using Muni."
130,2031,"Sep 17 2004	Pleasantly surprised	After reading some of the negative reviews, I bit my nails when Club Quarters popped up my screen after a Hotwire purchase. On our recent visit (9/10 and 11) we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived to find modern accommodations, free wireless internet access, helpful staff, and ample street parking if we did not feel like being robbed by the parking garages. The location was great; in the heart of the financial district, close to Chinatown and the Ferry Building (excellent outdoor farmer's market on Saturdays). The only downside is that the walls are a bit thin, so if you have a noisy neighbor I can see how sleep may be a problem. Perfect for a business trip or short stay. I'll definitely stay there again."
131,2031,"Sep 8 2004	Short Stay Just Fine	My wife and I stayed from Aug 27-30th in a room with a Queen bed. CQ was just right for us. We toured SF heavily and only used the room at night for sleeping. The property is in the financial district, so it was very quiet on the weekend. The bed was comfortable and everything looked new, modern, and clean. We only take showers, so not having a tub was no big deal. The free internet was great. I was able to do some SF research and print directions to attractions. I would only recommend CQ for short stays. Also, don't bring large pieces of luggage. These cozy rooms don't have much storage and you'll be stumbling over your gear."
132,2031,Aug 2 2004	Worked fine for us!
133,2031,Jun 20 2004	Should be Called the Tight Quarters Its Like a Cruise Ship in Hotel Form!
134,2031,May 31 2004	Not a 3-star property
135,2031,Mar 15 2004	Functional
136,2031,Mar 11 2004	Pretty Good!
137,2031,Sep 29 2003	Wonderful stay/teriffic location

140,2031,Jun 5 2009 	???????????????
1,2036,"Nov 9 2009 	Good hotel had a great stay. Wish all courtyard's could be like this.	Stayed here for a quick stay over in San Francisco. At check the friendly desk staff gave me a nice room with a view. The room was spacious, clean and well equipped. The only thing missing was a safe in the room. A large flat screen TV was present but the really cool thing was that the connections for the TV where available from a wall socket. So plugging in your laptop to play a movie on the big screen is easy ! The hotel is quite spacious and has a Starbucks attached to the entrance. There's a bar on the other side of the lobby as well. Also the lobby has a small outside square which is great to get some fresh air. The hotel is situated in walking (10 mins) distance from all the shops on market street &amp; union square. A shuttle server to the airport is available for $16 p/p.I'll definitely come back here again."
2,2036,"Oct 19 2009 	Confortable Stay	Pros- Comfortable modern hotel (like all other Marriotts)- Nice beds and room decor (quiet with no street noise)- Lots of taxis right outside the door- Most rooms have a sofabed and either a King or 2 Queens so you can accomodate 3-4 adults in a pinch-Free internet access - staff were attentive, courteous and professionalCons- Location - too far from the happening Union square area and is consequently dead at night- Breakfast is not included so you're stuck with their overpriced buffet (avoid at all costs - the pastries were old and stale) or alternatively head into the Starbucks and grab a morning snack. Unfortunately, due to their location there are no breakfast eateries close by.BottomlineI would have no problems recommending this hotel or staying here again on a future visit to San Francisco."
3,2036,"Oct 13 2009 	Awesome view	This hotel is located in downtown San Francisco, very convenient for shopping. My room was nice and clean and I had a great view. I'd book a room here again."
4,2036,"Oct 13 2009 	Very nice hotel in the financial district!	I stay at this hotel often for work. It's a great location and very easy to get to and from. The rooms are always very clean and my stay is always very nice. Their pool is kind of in the dungeon-y basement area, but it's a nice sized pool for relaxing at the end of a long day. I look forward to staying here every time I'm in San Francisco."
5,2036,"Oct 7 2009 	Met our needs and it was inexpensive	I can't say i enjoyed staying here like i have at some other marriotts I have stayed at but at the end of the day it met my expectations. Those expectations were that it was clean, quiet, it supplied a crib for my 3 month old son, and it seemed relatively safe. As a bonus it is close to almost everything I wanted to see. (Fisherman's wharf, market, ferry to Alcatrez, etc...) Parking very expensive but we found that you can pay for a day in their parkade starting in the morning and don't have to leave until the night of the next day. Almost a two for one deal:-) Otherwise we found parking on the street although my husband mentioned he didn't feel altogether safe walking back alone to the hotel after parking. Overall a good basic hotel that gets the job done."
6,2036,"Oct 6 2009 	Does its job well.	Stayed for 5 nights in SF.Hotel is just off Market Street in a quiet area, well it was when we stayed - Bay Bridge was closed for repairs.Close to Market Street to fully utilise SF's good public transport system. Buses, Cable, Trams etc.Close to AT&amp;T park as went to see the Giants one night.A few good restaurants close by we checked out - Umbria (Italian) &amp; Anchor &amp; Hope (Seafood)Room we had was very large, very clean and caught the morning sun.Not expensive and value for money."
7,2036,"Oct 5 2009 	This is a Courtyard? Really nice hotel downtown	Wow, this hotel was such a nice treat. Great public areas, great staff, super nice room (big).The food in the restaurant was great, nice bar, and a happening Starbucks. For a really good price. I highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure."
8,2036,"Oct 4 2009 	Central location great weekend rates.	We stayed here for a long weekend trip and were very pleased. The Courtyard by Marriott is excellent for a quick weekend getaway in San Francisco without having to rent a car. This location is primarily intended for business travelers and has few tourist amenities. The rooms were clean comfortable and affordable. They feature large flat screen TVs and free wired Wi-Fi. In the lobby there is a Starbucks that is open during the day till 2pm. Our room was on the top floor and had some nice bridge and city views. The hotel also has a small snack bar next to the front desk. The hotel restaurant and bar looked much underused on the weekend but San Francisco has too many good food choices in any price range to consider hotel food. We did try an Indian fast food restaurant and a Chinese restaurant that were two blocks away and open weekends. Both were very good and inexpensive.The Hotel is very centrally located in the financial district. This means on weekends, restaurant choices are limited and the streets are quiet in the evening. The hotel is walking distance to a trolley line, bus lines and the Montgomery BART station. We purchased a three day MUNI bus and trolley pass at the airport and had no problem getting to all of the sights.If you are a tourist seeking a clean, comfortable inexpensive place this hotel fits the bill. Be sure to check out the special weekend rates."
9,2036,Oct 3 2009	Very nice hotel	This was a very nice hotel. The rooms were a good size and very nicely decorated as well as very clean. One the lower floors there is street noise so if you are sensitive to that I would request a higher floor. It is near the financial district so we took cabs to most places we went but it was also quieter and away from the hussle and bussle on some busier streets. Overall I feel it was a good value. Breakfast in the morning is very overpriced. Go elsewhere if you can.
10,2036,"Sep 22 2009 	Nice hotel comfortable beds	We stayed at the Courtyard for a convention at the Moscone Center. It was about a 3 block walk from the hotel to the convention; not too bad, there is one block of a steeper incline that can challenge those that are less physically fit. The Powell/Hyde cable car line is about a 5 block walk to get to, the F line trolley car lets off at 2nd street and its about a 2 block walk and there are several bus lines that run a few blocks away. The only transportation we did not utilize was the BART (subway) or a taxi. The shuttle transfer from the airport and back was very convenient and easy to use. Our room was on the top floor, #18. We very rairley heard neighbors; the only noise we heard occaisionally was the wind but we got used to that after the first night. We had a nice view of the AT&amp;T stadium and a cruise ship docked at port. Our room was always clean and neat and I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful on all occasions. We used the pool and hot tub several days during our stay...we never saw another soul using the facilities...amazing for such a large hotel; the hot tub felt great after a long day walking around the city. We took a long bus trip out to Yosemite park...a must see if you manage it. I loved the park and want to see more, the few hours we had was not enough. Overall I had a fantastic time in SF, the people were friendly and there were lots of things to see, it was easy to get around and I enjoyed the hotel."
11,2036,Sep 9 2009 	I love this hotel - service is spot on	I have stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Downtown San Francisco. This is my 6th time at this hotel over the past two years.The rooms are always clean and comfortable and there is free high speed internet. If you didn't bring your computer they offer free computers in the lobby.They offere a small indoor pool and great hot tub that is in doors as well.It's nice having a starbucks in the lobby.Ask for a room tier 22 on a high floor for a great view of the bay bridge
12,2036,"Sep 9 2009 	Good Hotel for All Around Visit to SF	Stayed at this hotel, very nice property and the room was reasonably priced. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful, two room suite was very clean and well appointed. Since I had not spent a lot of time in SF I generally wasn't aware of the cost of the city. Very high, everywhere, especially for food, that's not of the fast food variety. In the hotel itself, $16 for a room service burger and $18 for the breakfast buffet. Strangely, the Starbucks in the hotel and 24 snack bar were priced very reasonably. There are generally no pizza chains such as Round Table, that I could find. We ordered local pizza and had it delivered to the hotel, which was very good but expensive ($58 for two pizzas with salad). We went to a Giants game, ATT park is only .7miles from the hotel and there is a very cheap all day parking lot for $8 which we parked at for the game. Bought tickets the day of the game (ATT Park is awesome). Giants tickets are not overly expensive except for behind home plate ($77 compard to $43 or so at Coors Field). Most hotels in the city have a parking fee, the Marriot's was $50. It's a valet service with unlimited privileges and I can say that SF is one of the worst places to take a car and then try to find parking. All in all a great hotel with great service. We went to many other locations in the city and didn't really feel like there was someplace else that was better in terms of location. SF is fairly easy to get around in with a car. Lots of boutique type restaurants and many are hidden, local knowledge is helpful to a good dining experience."
13,2036,"Sep 9 2009 	Very good but not so good as the others marriot	Ive chosen that hotel because Ive always been enthusiastic about Marriot hotels. However that one wasnt like I expected. OK, the room is very clean and comfortable. Internet with printer at the reception (nice facility). However we were 4 and everyday we were obliged to ask for more shampoo and bath-soap (they just put one for each day). One day the service room entered in the room 5 seconds after knocking the door. They could have waited a little bit more, I dont have time enough to open the door by myself. The swimming pool was broken and I couldnt manage to get miles because the reservation was in my fathers name Ok I prefer the NHs Hotels in Spain. Similar category, but some details are better.Despite of all (which I consider minors problems considering the global quality of the hotel), I still recommend the Marriot and I think that is a very good hotel. Pd. Better find a parking nearby, we managed to find one with a really good price (we stayed 5 days). 45 dollars is too much expensive! I dont remember the place but we managed to pay just 20 dollars and it was 5 min. walking."
14,2036,Sep 1 2009 	Very Pleased	My wife and I stayed at the Courtyard for 4 nights and we were very pleased we choose this property for our stay. We asked for a high floor on the off street side which was accommodated by TJ with no problem.He gave us a 16th floor end of the hall suite overlooking downtown and it was perfect..We didn't hear nothing for the entire 4 night stay!!We literally thought the Hotel was ours alone for the duration of the stay. All the staff was friendly when we seen them and the room was defiantly among the top we have stayed in San Francisco...Its 4 blocks to the BART Montgomery Station and AT&amp;T park is 4 blocks the opposite direction.We have been to San Fran many times and this is one of the places I would return to with no Hesitation.
15,2036,"Aug 31 2009 	No notice of closed pool for renovation!	We reserved our room at the Courtyard by Marriott months in advance for this family vacation. One VERY important element of any of our hotel reservations is that the hotel must have a pool for our kids. Well, we arrive at the Courtyard by Marriott only to be told the pool is closed for renovation. Are you kidding me?? The staff apologized and said that we could use the pool at the Conference Center Marriott (a 10-12 minute walk) for a fee of $10 per person. Are you kidding me?? After stating my displeasure they said they would pay for the Marriott pool fee for us - thanks but no thanks. Why not notify us about the pool renovation in their confirmation email we received just days before our arrival?? This is the second year in a row we had issues with a Courtyard by Marriott hotel - last year we arrived at another Courtyard by Marriott only to find out they gave our room away and had no room for us..."
16,2036,"Aug 29 2009 	Average hotel bit disappointing and wouldn't stay here again	Booked the hotel online for a reasonable rate and had expected a good hotel for the Marriot name. Front desk staff were helpful and friendly and check-in was smooth. The room however was gloomy, smelly and was not attractive. I was pretty disappointed. Internet was free though. Bathroom was equally unimpressive.Used the gym which was okay but given that the hotel was very very busy, there was often a wait for a machine (there were very few machines). Never used the pool. Location was not the best. I was in San Francisco for work and didn't have a car so walked a lot (which is fine in San Francisco) but south of Market can be pretty quiet and a little bit eery. Had a strange experience with the concierge when organising a car to take me to a business meeting. He seemed intent in booking a car for me for the return journey when I only needed one way and also to the airport when I wasn' t sure I'd need it a few days in advance. When I didn't use the return journey with the care service (and the car driver knew this and hadn't expected me either) I received a phone call from the concierge asking me my whereabouts and if I had used a car service etc for all of my journeys. I'm not really used to having to explain my whereabouts to a hote! Given his keen interest in my travel plans I can only assume he receives some kind of fee if I used the car service he had called for me. It was pushy and not a positive experience. The restaurant was fine, breakfast was good and staff were generally very helpful and friendly."
17,2036,"Aug 25 2009 	Total Let Down	So first thing we check in, and on the counter is a letter stating that the pool is down for maintainence, which I thought, if it had been planned, couldn't they have told us, or if it was unplanned it was ok, BUT THEN, they had the audacity to say that we could use the Marriott on 4th's pool FOR $10 bucks a day. That was ridiculous.Second, my partner and I forgot Q-tips, so I call down to the front desk to ask for some &quot;We don't have any, but you can PURCHASE some from the Marketplace&quot; Really? I've stayed at many Marriotts and never not been able to get basic toiletries from the hotel if I've forgotten them.Third, the Starbucks on-site, in what was a crowded hotel, which caters to business travellers and tourist who are in and out all day, closed at 2pm on the weekdays and 12pm on the weekends. And they were the only Starbucks for a couple blocks. Not customer friendly.Fourth, there was no WiFi in the rooms. I have never stayed at a Marriott without WiFi available.This was the worst Marriott hotel I've ever been to and will not return to this location."
18,2036,"Aug 19 2009 	Great downtown location and great package value	Our family of three traveled to San Francisco in mid-August for vacation. We wanted a downtown location to provide a different type of experience and the convenience of the cable cars and other tourist areas. We booked our hotel through Marriott's site which was the best deal. I specifically was looking for a 1 bedroom suite and the room we stayed in was fabulous. We purchased the escape romantic package as value of the complimentary valet parking each night, breakfast for two both mornings, and complimentary bottle of champagne far exceeded the normal price for the room-alone. We only paid $30 more per night for these amenities.The room was a corner suite on the 12th floor, and was by far the largest suite we've stayed in. It had a large coach and chaise lounge, huge bar area. The dressing area between the bedroom and large bathroom as quite large as well. You have to use the valet to park unless you choose one of the parking lots nearby. Since it was included in our package, we obviously used it. We didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes at any time to get our car. The breakfast is buffet style and kids 12 and under eat free. They have quiet a variety and it was easy to get in and out of quickly. The bar and grill area is small. Don't be in a rush for drinks or dinner, though -- the service was quite slow. The wait staff seemed more interested in talking to each other and guests, than actually providing service. It does close down fairly early (10pm) I believe, but you can get individual beers at a very reasonable price in their small market area. The food was OK -- not much selection and we only opted for it as we got in late and didn't want to wander out. If given a choice, I wouldn't recommend it as there was not much to offer, especially for kids, and the price was a bit high. The lobby area was quite large as it offered nice seating area, the convenience of Starbucks, and a nice outdoor seating area. The location is good as it is very convenient to Hwy 101. All-in-all, it was a great location, very well-kept hotel, and the value was excellent."
19,2036,"Aug 11 2009 	Great Hotel	This is an absolutely recommendable hotel for your stay in San Francisco. We stayed there for 4 nights. Very nice and clean rooms, very safe, but centrally located area and a nice pool and gym area (That all sounds enthusiastic, but I don`t get payed for writing this, I am from Germany and was travelling with my family through CA. and we really enjoyed our stay there). The parking was very expensive : 49 $ incl. tax, so you better look for a public parking, that is only half the price. Staff was very friendly, all in all: absolutely recommendable !"
20,2036,"Aug 6 2009 	perfect location for SF Giants fans	we originally booked the Courtyard at Fishermans Wharf so were hesitant when told that we were moved downtown, however we never regreted the stay - its got all the amnities you are used when travelling on business expect for a fridge - anyway a HUGE PLUS for SF Giants fans from abroad as this hotel is located just a stroll away from the AT&amp;T ballpark and in fact you can see many people walking back to the hotel after the games...&quot;"
21,2036,"Aug 4 2009 	A Good Choice At A Reasonable Price	We stayed at this hotel for a week at the end of July. It is a little bit further away from the crowds in the main part of the city, but is only an easy 5 minute walk from the shops and BART/MUNI in one direction and about 10 minutes from the AT&amp;T stadium in the other.We booked one of the suites and were really glad that we did. The lounge area had 2 large sofas that were great for chilling out on after a hard days sightseeing. Another plus is the free internet access that is provided, and if you dont travel with a laptop there is internet access available in the lobby/lounge areas.We actually ate breakfast in the hotel most mornings, even though it is the traditional american buffet, it was always well cooked and hot and the service from the staff was attentive at all times. There is also a bar which we only went to once as it seemed expensive.Because this is a business district there didn't seem to be many places to eat in the evenings locally, there is a fantastic italian restaurant across the road which is well worth a visit as the food is top quality and a decent price - just be aware the manager (?) is a little unusual!!!!!"
22,2036,"Jul 20 2009 	Great Location for Giants Baseball	My wife and I came down from northern California to see a Giants baseball game on Saturday. Marriott.com had good specials for the weekend and we booked online. It was a little hard to find, probably because we're not used to the city, but once there everything went smoothly. The place is located right down town. We walked right to the ball park. We felt like we had a great location to walk to just about anywhere to get food and drinks. Very nice, clean stay. Quiet room.Keep in mind:$50 to park, unless you get a package deal, vallet only.Lounge closes at 11 and is not a place I'd recommend.Staff was great, helpful, friendly."
23,2036,"Jul 9 2009 	Return was Good	I last stayed here before I started writing reviews for Tripadviser. I am happy to see it is still a good hotel. Check-in was welcoming, and I didn't even have to ask for a high floor, they gave me a room on the 15th, which was really comfortable, I relaxed in there for 3 hours before I went out again. The rate of $129 a night was a bargain for such a big-size room with a view, and free Internet. It was relatively quiet in my room and on my floor. Very relaxing. The bed was comfortable, especially the back rest. Only inconveniences and they were slight, was that the thermostat in the room was hard to control. Also, the location of the hotel was further from the Bart than I remembered, but once you get to the subway, it is a quick ride to the airport."
24,2036,"Jul 8 2009 	Marriott Courtyard A Good Choice	Very nice hotel, and got a great rate.Traveled with spouse and extended family, with two little ones. We had adjoining rooms and were very comfortable. Beds a bit firm for my taste, and the room a bit stuffy. Starbucks in lobby was convenient and courtyard was nice for eating breakfast. We parked on the street, which was great."
25,2036,"Jul 7 2009 	A very nice hotel in SOMA.	A very nice hotel in SOMA. We prefer staying in hotels not in the touristy area and this is a very good choice. The parking is very expensive, but there is free street parking on Sundays which I recommend."
26,2036,Jul 6 2009 	Excellent Staff Clean and Convenient	Spent two nights at this hotel over July 4th holiday. Staff was very accomodating and they keep the place clean and comfortable. Valet service was particularly good and I was impressed that the staff did not seem to expect tips although they accepted them greatfully when offered.
27,2036,"Jun 22 2009 	I don't know how it could have been better	Clean, comfortable, very nice, new-feeling rooms. Free broadband internet is a big plus. The hotel is a very do-able walk from just about all the tourist areas except Fisherman's Wharf -- but with SF's great public transportation system, getting around really isn't an issue. It's in a quieter area, which I find more pleasant than the busier locations. It's close to AT&amp;T Park. Also close to two excellent brew pubs, 21st Amendment and the Thirsty Bear. Check them out. This property seems to be priced below the market rate, but don't let that fool you. It is a very nice hotel... the price makes it a real steal."
28,2036,"Jun 19 2009 	Nice hotel convenient location	Nothing amazing, but clean and comfortable. Decent little fitness center and a small pool. I stayed here three nights and walked to Moscone (West) and back each day for conference. Took a little over 5 minutes to walk. It was also close to the Montgomery BART station which made it easy to get to SFO when my stay was complete."
29,2036,"Jun 17 2009 	Awesome Hotel Choice!	Clean, friendly, nice rooms, safe, convenient location, free wi-fi, close to transit systems, street parking is free on weekends. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit."
30,2036,"Jun 16 2009 	Nice Spot	I just returned from a two night stay at this Courtyard Marriott. I frequently travel to San Francisco, but this was my first time staying in SOMA (South of Market). The hotel itself was quite nice, very new and clean. Staff was courteous at check in/check out and were helpful and friendly even though it was a hectic two days for the hotel with a big event. We were in a smallish room with a queen bed and a pull out couch. We had a bit of a view on the 12th floor and could see the Bay Bridge. One odd thing was that they do not have wireless internet, you have to actually plug in. Granted they provide you a cord to do so, but it is 2009 and I haven't been tethered to a desk in a long time, it didn't seem to fit the new hotel vibe. The area is definitely a weekday type place, as it is where many office buildings are. If you are there on the weekend be warned that many of the coffee shops, sandwich shops etc. are not open. On Saturday you are within a 15 minute walk to the Ferry Building Farmers Market, which is a can't miss event. In addition, you are about a 10 minute walk to AT&amp;T Park to see the Giants play, which seems to be a huge draw for the hotel. Fisherman's Wharf is walkable, but it's a hike, about a 45 minute walk, moving quickly, but there are always trolleys and other means of transportation. Also if you have kids the Yerba Buena Gardens are about 4 blocks away and they have a great playground and grassy area. Parking as is the case with any San Francisco hotel is quite expensive, about $50 a day. They do have a gym, which had some cardio and weights and a pool and jacuzzi. We did not try the restaurant or the bar. There is a great Italian restaurant a half a block away, you can see it from the front entrance of the hotel, and it's called Umbria. Very nice food!"
31,2036,"Jun 10 2009 	Good choice for families	We stayed in a 1-bedroom suite for 3 nights. Front desk staffs were prompt and professional. The suite was spacious, clean and comfortable. It has a microwave, a small refrigerator and ample storage space. We travelled with 2 young boys (6 &amp; 8), and they slept on a queen size sofabed in the sitting room comfortably. The hotel is about 5 minutes walk to Market Street, and 15 minutes walk to the cable car station and Union Square. We like this hotel because it is not right in the center of a busy area. It is in a quieter area, and it is more pleasant to walk around compared to Union Square and Chinatown where there are constant flow of traffic and pedestrians during the day. It can be a little unnerving walking with kids during peak hours. We also walked to Ferry Building from our hotel (about 15 minutes) to check out a farmers market (which opens on Sundays only, I think??) Great place to go to if you are a food lover/adventurer. If you walk towards Market Street from the hotel, you will find a few restaurants and pubs (sandwiches shops, pizza, Thai, Japanese). There is also an Indian resturanant (food's ok) and a convenient store directly across the hotel. We also liked the fact that the hotel has an indoor pool (only 3 ft deep; great for kids!) in case we had to stay in due to bad weather. Room service is fast, pricey and only of average quality (considering the price). And YES, we will definitely return to this hotel again when in SF. We paid $179++ for the 1-bdrm suite, and we thought it was a good price compared to other hotels in the area at that time."
32,2036,"Jun 9 2009 	JavaOne Conference	It was exceptional quality service. Though I had done an online booking, I did not have to wait once I reached there; it was as if they were waiting for me to arrive. I really liked it."
33,2036,"Jun 7 2009 	Clean new hotel with great location	We arrived 2 hours early hoping to just stash our bags, and were pleasantly surprised when told our room was ready. The room itself was comfortable, with an LCD tv, comfy king bed, sofa, coffee maker, but no fridge. The room was moderately sized, bigger than many of the older hotels in SF. The heated indoor pool and jacuzzi were a nice plus. The room rate was very reasonable, but valet parking cost us over 1/3 of what we paid for the room itself. Even so, the combined cost was still a pretty good deal. I would stay here again."
34,2036,"Jun 1 2009 	Excellent deal!	We got a $103 rate for two nights - the place was quiet and very comfortable, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and the location granted walking access to museums and the farmer's market/Embarcadero.In/Out Parking is expensive - but that's true for any place you stay.Amazing!"
35,2036,"Jun 1 2009 	Pragmatic Stay; typical Courtyard experience	My stay here at the Courtyard by Marriott San Francisco Downtown location was for a single night. I was able to check in early with no problems (not always the case due to availability) and did not request a late check out, nor did I interact further with the staff, other than the housekeeper who came initially around 9am to see if I had checked out yet, which was not an issue at all.This is a downtown hotel; is is within walking distance to a BART station. This was handy as I arrived into SFO airport and left the area on the BART system the next day. Hotel is short distance to Walgreens. I can't attest to parking rates or policies since I didn't have a vehicle.Internet in room is wired and free. I didn't use this hotel for anything other than a single night stayover. (Breakfast is NOT complimentary.) Overall, nothing fancy; but clean, modern and up-to-date."
36,2036,"May 31 2009 	Pleasent stay at the Courtyard!	I stayed here for a conference that was being held at the hotel. I usually stay at the Hilton San Francisco though because the meeting was being held at the Courtyard I decided that it was easiest to stay there. For $199 I got valet parking privileges and the room all included. Check-in was fast and easy. Even though I have no status with Marriott I got one of the rooms on a high floor. The room was very nice (much nicer then Hiltons) with a plasma TV, comfy bed, nice furnisher, and my favorite: free wifi. I also got a 2pm check-out with no problem. I loved the indoor pool and Jacuzzi as well!They had some free on-demand movies/you tube clips on the TV which my collegue and I really enjoyed. 'David at the Dentist' anyone?I think next time I would still stay at the Hilton just because I am a gold member there so I get a free full breakfast and upgrade. Also, they are usually a bit less expensive even when you include parking. Nonetheless, I still had a very pleasant stay!"
37,2036,"May 19 2009 	Great Value in Pricey City	I've previously stayed in the Fishermans Wharf area but wanted a change without breaking the bank. The good price and reviews lead me to try this hotel. If you are not familiar with San Francisco it may seem a bit out tof the way but we walked most places with no problems. It's only 15 minutes to Union Square and we walked to Pier 39 in about 45 minutes. If you are comfortable walking or using the local public transport the location is fine as a base. The room was fairly quiet considering the city centre location and it was spacious and clean. Overall I was happy with my choice, I would have paid much more for the same standard of accomodation in a more popular &quot;tourist&quot; part of the city."
38,2036,"Feb 27 2009 	A good value hotel	We stayed here with 2 children 8 and 6 for a week in February. We booked it because of the price and the indoor pool. When we got to the hotel we upgraded our room for $50 a night to a King Bed suite- the kids slept on a sofa bed in the living room! Excellent - lots of space and privacy! The kids liked the pool that opened at 5am, as they were on uk time, they had already been awake for 2 hours so it was a perfect way to while away some time before breakfast. I don't understand why people say it is not near anywhere, it is a 5-10 minute walk from the Museum of Modern Art, the Yerba Buena gardens, which has zeum, a great museum for kids, bowling and an icerink. It is 10 minute from union Square. 5 minutes from a bus stop that gets you to all the waterside attractions. There are restaurants all around. It is a good city hotel for the money you pay,"
39,2036,"Feb 19 2009 	Disappointing	We returned from a two night stay at this Marriott Courtyard. The hotel itself has some positive features to offer, however, the service is terrible. Our stay started out fine, but ended on a very sour note.The pro's:- Clean newer hotel- Starbuck's inside the hotel (although it closes very early)- Computers/printers in the lobby area for guest useThe con's:- Small rooms- Thin walls- Location- not within walking distance to anything interesting- Parking fees- $45 + taxes a day- Rude service- from the bellman to the front desk- Indoor Pool is more like a small &quot;wading pool&quot; as it's only 3 ft deep and small- The restaurant prices are over the top- good food, but very expensiveWe encountered an issue while staying at the hotel- they closed the pool for practically the entire time we were there- making a very unhappy 6 year old, especially since it was cold and rainy outside. When we brought our complaint about specifically booking a hotel with an indoor pool (and we even called ahead to make sure the pool was open) the front desk manager was not at all concerned, nor did they offer any acceptable solutions- except to tell us that the pool was just an &quot;amenity&quot; and that we could transfer to another marriott - and pay a higher rate- totally unacceptable.I will definitely stay at another hotel when I return to SF- due to the poor service, the bad location, and our overall experience.Avoid headaches- stay at the Hyatt or Hilton instead."
40,2036,"Feb 14 2009 	Very impressed with this Courtyard Marriott.	Great hotel in downtown area, within walking distance to most attractions and business needs. Staff was exceptional. Rooms very clean and spacious. Beds comfortable and with two teens, it was great to have a pull out bed. Only one warning: Restaurant prices are over the top. For example, there was no buffet available during our stay so we had to order off the menu. Everything is priced separately. Sample price-two eggs, toast, homefries and bacon will run you about $25 a plate. The service and quality of the food was excellent, however, the price was not in line with traditional restaurants in major cities. The only other tip is to be prepared for the $50 per night parking charge. (after tips) Very typical for most cities. (our room rate was $134 booked via Marriott website) Overall: Highly recommend this hotel."
41,2036,"Jan 3 2009 	Modern and Clean with Pool	I stayed in 3 properties while on my vacation in SF and I have to say that this was my favourite property, the one that I would choose to go back to. The upside of this hotel is that it is very modern and fairly new (built in 2000). It felt refreshing to be in the room, after a long day. It has a swimming pool and this is quite a rare find in the core SF area. The gym was also adequate. The room was spotlessly clean and the staff I encountered were professional and attentive. Complimentary internet access in the room was a plus, considering many of the hotels of this scale do charge. The bed was also comfortable and room was decent size. There is Starbucks on site, as well as Jasmine's for breakfast. There is also a bar and lounge called Whispers, great for business travelers looking for a drink in the evening.I think it's a great hotel for someone looking to be near the convention center (Moscone). It is also walking distance (8-15 min) to BART station and Westfield Shopping Center.Overall, a nice stay, I will stay at this hotel again when I'm in SF."
42,2036,"Dec 25 2008 	Great convention hotel	I stayed here 4 nights for a scientific / medical convention. This was a great choice - it was $40-70/night cheaper ($50-90 when you consider internet access) than the bigger hotels next to the Moscone Convention Center but only 2.5 blocks away. The hotel is relatively new, and the rooms are large, newly decorated and comfortable. I had a king room with a sofa and coffee table. The room had a large flat screen TV and free wired internet. The only downsides were the small bathroom and the lack of view of my 6th floor room (it stared right into the offices across the street). The staff are friendly and competent. It is about 2.5 long city blocks from the nearest BART station and 10-15 min by foot to Union Square and 15 min to Chinatown."
43,2036,Dec 11 2008 	Nice Hotel in SOMA	Rooms were comfortable. Walking distance to the Moscone Center and shopping. Close to public transportation. Only negative was that there was no wifi in the rooms. Would have been nice to have that.
44,2036,Nov 25 2008 	Comfortable hotel near Moscone Convention Center	My husband and I stayed in a suite at the Marriott Courtyard. It had a king bed in one room and a nice size sitting area in the other room. There was a door to close to the bedroom. I had to get up early for my conference and I could sleep while he stayed up. The price was the best I could find for a suite near the convention center. The staff was helpful. The seating area in the lobby was functional. There is a bar and a restaurant which was over priced as are most hotels.There is a Starbucks off the lobby and a tasty India restaurant across the street. It was a three block walk to the convention center. The whirlpool was not working in the hot tub. There is a nice little balcony with seating by the pool. We would definitely return to this hotel.
45,2036,"Nov 9 2008	Management is tops	We stayed at the Courtyard for the San Francisco Nike Women's Marathon. We found the staff, and bellmen specifically to be FAR above par. They went the extra mile in EVERYTHING to make sure that we enjoyed our experience and to ensure that we felt &quot;at home.&quot; They were very efficient with handling our luggage before check in and prior to check out. The hotel has a Starbucks in the lobby, a well kept work out facility, fresh complimentary water and coffee, and a VERY clean atmosphere. The beds were wonderfully comfortable. TV's are updated and a great size. The location is perfect. Within a mile walk of Fisherman's Wharf and the entire &quot;Pier&quot; experience...a streetcar ride away from all of the the listed above. A short walk to the well known &quot;Union Square&quot; shopping...and very central to all public transportation. The bellhops had superb directions/ maps, and more to offer on suggestion than most &quot;upscale&quot; concierge services even offer!"
46,2036,"Oct 21 2008 	Excellent business choice	I stayed at the Courtyard for four nights for a convention at the Moscone Center. I chose the Courtyard because it was less expensive than other business and branded hotels within a few blocks of the convention center. I booked through the Marriott website and had a rate of $199 per night.The hotel looks to be newer. Everything is clean and working perfectly. The lobby is inviting. My room was on the 8th floor and faced northwest. My room had a king-sized bed, a couch (pull-out sleeper), and a desk. The room was comfortable and had plenty of room. The bathroom was also larger than I expected, but it looks to be ADA compliant, hence the extra room. The bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of pillows.The hotel was quiet. I never heard any noise outside my room. The desk staff was friendly and helpful. Check-in was quick. I asked for a restaurant suggestions one night, and I was given several options from which to choose.The hotel is 2.5 blocks from the entrance to the Moscone Center. It's 3 blocks from Market Street and the Montgomery BART station. There are plenty of restaurants within a few blocks.While I think nearly $200 is a high price for a hotel room, this was cheaper than many rooms in the area, so I will consider it a good value based on the local market.I reserve giving a full 5 rating for truly exceptional stays and values, and this Courtyard comes very close. This hotel has easily earned my rating of 4 and then some. I would definitely stay here again. (CS)"
47,2036,"Sep 5 2008 	Highly recommend Coutyard Marriott downtwon San Francisco	Excellent location, renovated rooms, clean, good value except parking at about $45 a day. But San Francisco parking is expensive everywhere. Car rentals are expensive, but airport taxi is even more. There are a number of restaurants in walking distance."
48,2036,"Sep 2 2008	Pretty Dang Good	My wife and I stayed both at this hotel and the Courtyard at the Warf and based on just hotel quality, cleanliness, and comfort the downtown Courtyard is far superior."
49,2036,"Sep 1 2008 	great stay away from the crowd	We stayed 5 nights in a one bedroom suite. We had the King bedroom and our teenage girls had a fold-out couch and roll-away in the sitting room. Plenty of room and other than a little street noise it was pretty quiet. Some neighboring guests decided to host a party at 4am one night and one call to the front desk shut them down pretty quick. There really are many good restaurants within walking distance if you look. The area was clean and as safe as any big city can be, much nicer than union square area. We bought muni passes and got around easily. The buses and underground were fastest. We hit the Starbucks every morning but baked goods are only delivered weekdays. One problem was wireless didn't work in the room so my husband had to take his laptop to the lobby to work. They had two computers for guests but there was always a line waiting and they caused nothing but bad feelings, if you were using. one someone was always giving you the evil eye waiting or vice versa. Most requests and questions were answered quickly. Pool area was small but nice. We had drinks and snacks in the lobby/bar/restaurant area and it was good."
50,2036,"Aug 26 2008 	Spacious comfortable in-city option	Our room at the Marriott was, for an in-city hotel, very generously sized. We had 2 Q's plus a sofa bed: just perfect for our family that includes teens of opposite genders. The beds are lovely--comfie, great linens (all cotton, triple-sheeted) and the whole room was clean and showed that it's a relatively new place. The location was quieter than some places in the city, but a good 15-20 minute walk from Union Square. Not a problem for our long-legged kids but for little ones, it might be a hefty walk. The hill to the hotel is gentle however, especially compared to hotels on the other side of Market. There are not a lot of eating options in the neighborhood on weekends, as this is a part of town that seems to be where there is more activity Mon-Fri. We found the breakfast too pricey at the restaurant, but there is a Starbuck's in the lobby. We found a cute place in South Park, about 10 minutes walk, to have breakfast one day for about half the price of the hotel restaurant. The kids did order room service for dessert one evening and were pleased with the quality. Front desk staff busy and professional. Clerk named JP was super helpful in getting us the room configuration we needed. Cookies in late afternoon at front desk a bonus! We didn't know there was a pool at the hotel until we got there. A small indoor pool but the setting is nice, with a courtyard off the back. There was also a small excercise room. Parking is very expensive, compared with the rates at this hotel. The attendant told us it was $43/night plus about $6 in taxes--in and out privileges allowed via valet. Since we were not planning to use our car at all for 2 days, this seemed too high. We asked him for other options and he pointed to a building across the street that was $22 per day. No in/out privileges but good for just a safe place to stow the car. We did take our car out on Sunday (paid in the lobby of that building as the garage was closed to enter) and when we returned parked on the street in the same block as the hotel, which was free until 7 a.m Monday. Car was fine in the morning but the meter maid was waiting to make sure we but money in the meter!The Courtyard was a great choice for our family and a good value for the rate paid ($169/weekend AAA rate, booked 3 months in advance)."
51,2036,"Aug 14 2008	Nice Option	Stayed here for 2 nights on business - I heard it was fairly new and the location seemed good. I thought the front desk/lobby area was very efficient and modern, although it always seemed to be noisy because of all the glass and marble floors, etc. Check-in was extremely efficient, I think I was in my room within 5 minutes of walking in the front door. The room was very spacious and one thing I really noticed was the excellent lighting, especially for business travel when you're working in your room at night! Big flat screen TV and very comfortable bed.The only complaint I had is that the walls are pretty thin - one night I was up all night because my next door neighbors were talking very loudly and coming in and out of their room (banging doors) - and I mean all night - til 5:30am. They weren't out-of-control partying, just loud, and I could hear it all! Didn't use the hotel restaurant or fitness center, but I am planning to return next month. Overall a good choice - good restaurants within a few blocks and easy access to taxis and public transport."
52,2036,Jul 25 2008 	clean 	We originally had a room booked at the Courtyard Fisherman's Wharf. They oversold the hotel and sent us to the Courtyard Downtown. The staff at the Courtyard Downtown was professional and processed our reservation quickly. The front desk gave us a good recommendation for a pizza delivery and upgraded us to a King Suite for our troubles at the Courtyard Fisherman's Wharf. We were very appreciative of his efforts. The King Suite was very large and clean. There is free internet access in the lobby. Prompt Valet service.
53,2036,"Jul 22 2008 	great hotel for family group of 5	We were a family group of 5, parents plus 3 older kids 18, 16, 12. The one bedroon suite offered was perfect for us for the 4 nights. Plenty big for comfort; bigger than average one-bed apt in Dublin. 2 rooms, living cum 2nd bedroom with microwave, fridge, sink, coffee machine. Bedroom had a comfortable king. Kids found fold out bed and roll-away bed in living room were comfortable too. A TV in each room which was fab. we were on holidays so not spending too much time in the room but all 5 of us were very pleased with the hotel. Staff absolutely first class. breakfast was only meal we had in hotel.opted for the buffet and it was grand. enough to tide us over until dinner really. walk to union square was about 20 mins.this didnt bother us.had no problem getting taxis if we needed and they were a reasonably priced option - outside of rush-hour anyway! We would stay here again and recommend it highly."
54,2036,"Jul 6 2008 	Great location and an indoor pool too!	My family and I (wife and 6 yo son) stayed for 7 nights. We selected the hotel because of its proximity to Moscone Convention Center and the presence of a pool. The indoor pool was a big plus, because the weather in SF was about 50 degrees - the pool (and the fitness room) were well kept and opened very early (5 am for the pool) which was very helpful for travelers from the East Coast.Overall the facilities were clean and well maintained. Front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The room was clean with a decent view.The restaurant had a buffet breakfast which was good, although pricey. I ordered something off the menu (ie avoided the buffet) and it took quite a bit more time for preparation and did not come out very appetizing.The location was within a few blocks of Moscone and a few blocks of Market Street. It was about a 15 minute walk (25 minutes with a 6 yo) from the Ferry Building."
55,2036,"Jun 29 2008 	Perfect location good weekend value	I've stayed at this hotel numerous times when visiting San Francisco on weekends. It is typically a great weekend value compared to other San Francisco hotels, it is clean, there's free WiFi, a Starbucks downstairs, and really the location cannot be beat - 3 blocks from BART/Muni, and Market St. Many of the rooms have great downtown views too.As someone else noted, the gym is not worth going to unless you are a cardio-only person."
56,2036,"Jun 9 2008 	Not bad	Courtyard (by Marriott) is located just north of the Moscone convention centre. It is still a distance to walk compared to other hotels such as Intercontinental, Marriott and W Hotel.It is near to the financial district but further to Union Square compared to many other hotels but it is within walking distance to Market Street where you can take streetcars, trains, buses etc. It is possible to walk to Union Square and chinatown though.The hotel is near offices and it is quiet unlike hotels near union square where you can hear cable cars and sirens etc. The rooms are simple. You don't get a fridge but they do have a nice flat screen TV. Internet is part of the room rate (at least for me, which is good for business travellers)I was staying at the Hotel Nikko. I thought it was cheaper and clearly better. Having said that, Courtyard by all means is a decent hotel too.The beds are comfortable with good pillows.I didnt try any restaurants in the hotel. So cannot comment on the food.Front desk provides prompt and acceptable services."
57,2036,"Jun 4 2008 	Clean good food but gym rats beware	I stayed here for a business trip for 2 nights in June. It seems rather newly refurbished or built as the bathrooms have granite and the TV is a flat screen. It was a pretty standard courtyard but the food (dinner) was better than most courtyards. However the food was pricey. The breakfast buffet was 20 bucks and nothing extraordinary. My only real complaint was the gym. It was smaller than my hotel room and had 3 cardio machines, two weight machines and some dumbells. The pool was tiny as well (not a lap pool). So long as your not the buisness type that likes to workout not a big deal. Tip: If you are new to San Fran and would like a view of the Golden Gate bridge while dining there are actually very few choices. The one I tried was Greens at the Fort Mason Center building A. It's about a $15 cab ride away. It's a vegitarian restaurant so it won't be for everyone the food was excellent and the view was amazing."
58,2036,"Jun 1 2008 	Great stay at the Courtyard	We really enjoyed our 11-night in the Courtyard: as a combined business/leisure trip, we found that the hotel catered perfectly to both groups of travelers. The city view room was spacious, comfortable, and clean. The complimentary high-speed internet always worked; staff and housekeeping were very friendly and efficient. The lobby was also handy for working, with free wifi."
59,2036,"May 22 2008 	Mediocre at best	When I arrived there was a obnoxious drinking crowd at their bar &quot;whispers,&quot; ans whilst at pool and jacuzzi, forgetting my bathing suit, but tightly wrapped in a large towel became a security beach! I realize this is Northern CA, but lay off the prude Victoreanism. Reporting this to Security &amp; San Francisco Police authorities has become joke's on you. Lighen up, will ya.Thanks for the hospitality."
60,2036,"May 19 2008 	Comfortable Convenient and Friendly Downtown San Francisco Hotel	May 14 to 17th 2008  Attending a trade show in San Francisco, I had the opportunity to spend three nights at the Courtyard downtown hotel. I really enjoyed my stay and recommend the hotel highly.Check-in was very fast, taking less than a minute. I received my preference of a room on a high floor, room #1423. The room rate was $229 per night with taxes adding an additional $32. The town was full due to the Heart Rhythm Society meeting.Something that impressed me during my entire stay was how fast the elevator service was. The hotel was full, but I never waited more than about 15  30 seconds for an elevator.Room #1423 faces Southwest, towards Moscone Center, two blocks away. It was one of the quietest hotel rooms that I have ever stayed in. I never once heard any noise from either adjacent room or the hallway; amazing! The room was large and seemed very open, probably due to the full wall of windows. One window opened allowing fresh air in, which I appreciated.The room was decorated very nicely with black and white photos of the area on the walls. The bed was very comfortable and lighting excellent. My room had a super comfortable chair and ottoman from which I watched some of the NBA playoffs on the 37 flat-screen TV. I did feel it a shame to have a large high-definition TV without any high-definition programming. The hotel offers a large channel assortment as well as pay-per-view programming.My room had a large work desk with complimentary wired internet service by Ibahn. Download speed was about 4mbs and upload 2.2 mbs when tested with the Speakeasy internet speed test. The office-style chair was comfortable and desk lighting good.The bathroom consisted of a small vanity area and reasonable sized bathroom with a combination tub and shower. Water pressure was excellent and hot water flowed immediately from either the shower or sink. Towels for four were provided. The in-room coffee maker was located on the bath vanity.My colleagues and I had breakfast each day in the hotel dining room. A full menu was available as well as both a full (hot) buffet and continental buffet. I chose the continental buffet which included everything except eggs and meat. The buffet offered four fresh fruits and a large assortment of breakfast breads. The hot buffet was $14 and the cold $11. Both included coffee and juices. Besides the restaurant, there is a full service Starbucks in the hotel.The hotel bar was friendly and comfortable. We watched some of the NBA playoffs on the three large screen TVs. We did not eat in the bar, but quite a few others had ordered food.There are many good restaurants within a couple of minute walk from the hotel. We ate at Mefil, an Indian restaurant right across the street from the hotel Food and service were excellent! We also had a great Italian dinner at Umbria, a short block away. A good meal was enjoyed at a Thai restaurant on 2nd Street as well as an inexpensive Japanese lunch at Tempura House also on 2nd. There are plenty of good eating choices less than two blocks from the hotel.The hotel has a small, but nice, indoor swimming pool and hydrotherapy pool. Next to the pool is a very well equipped exercise room. All of the equipment looked brand new. Each of the machines had a LCD TV attached to help pass the time.The hotel is about three blocks from the Montgomery BART station, a five minute walk. I saw that valet parking was $43 per day and not much less for other lots in the area. I was glad that did not have a car.Everyone that I came in contact with at the Courtyard was very friendly and helpful. I asked for an early check in and my room was ready. I needed a late check-out and it was granted. I thought the service was excellent and the associates friendly and helpful."
61,2036,"May 10 2008 	Not a bad stay	I stayed in this hotel with my family while attending JavaOne 2008. There are a lot of positives for this hotel and a few disappointments.Positives 1- It's in a great location. Easy to get on to I 80 and head to Oakland, easy to get to the water front and easy to get to 101 to head to Silicon valley. It's also a nice walk to the Moscone Center 2- We could sleep 5 comfortable in the room (2 queens and a sofa-bed) 3- Great price. For the other hotels in the area, this was a good value. 4- Helpful front desk staffDisappointments 1- The poll is small. The deepest end is 3.5 feet (yes, just a little more than a meter). The shallow end is 3 feet 2- Parking is expensive. $50/night once you include taxes 3- 2 of the 5 nights we had to call housekeeping to get sheets for the sofa-bed. One time it took 3 hours for them to arrive 4- The day we arrived the street that the main entrance was on was closed making it very difficult to get to the hotel."
62,2036,"May 5 2008 	Great Location!	Good Room, nice location. Kind of sterile furnishings.I couldn't understand why they bothered putting HDTV in the rooms since the TV reception was the worst I have seen in a city. Any city."
63,2036,"Mar 29 2008 	Ok Hotel	Hotel is located on a very busy roads, we were on the 11th floor and were awoke by road noise each morning - early!! Not very nice when you are on holidays. Tried to use Marriott Uk Pound vouchers on check-in which the clerk stated they did not accept - strange as the vouchers state they are accepted at 2600 hotels. After pointing this out the clerk who referred this to the FO manager Barbara who said that they did not accept foreign currencies etc but would check with their accounts dept on Monday 2 days after my checkin and get back to me. An international hotel in downtown SFO not accepting foreign currancies strange - especially as they were vouchers issued by Marriott themselves. Eventually they were accepted but at a rip off rate of 1.79$ to 1. Would not stay again due to location. Only stayed here as the SFO Marriott was undergoing a refurbishment and did not want to be woken by noise in the morning.Breakfast was ok and staff friendly in the restaurant. which only opened for breakfast. Very limited restuarant service for dinner in the bar area with very poor seating and tv's showing sports channels.Noticed parking very expensive( seems to be typical in SFO hotels) - try parking in local lots near the hotel which are just down the street and cheaper.Booked a suite which was basic but spacious. Was told it had been just refurbished - but had stains on the furniture and curtains. Bathroom was very basic for a suite."
64,2036,"Mar 13 2008 	Spacious comfortable stay in San Fran	Stayed at the Courtyard Marriott San Francisco Downtown for 3 nights in late January with 3 other adults (group of 4 in total). In a 2 Queen bed room for about US$220 a night. Loved the size of the hotel room. Very spacious and comfortable room. The beds were very comfortable and easily shareable between two people. Free internet was a big plus. Hotel pool and gym was pretty reasonable too.We arrived to check in just after midnight, getting in from Oakland airport and were checked in within minutes of arrival. Reception was helpful in suggesting some places to order dinner from at the late hour.The starbucks in the lobby is very convenient for the time limited tourist, we ended up getting bagels with cream cheese and our daily fix of caffine there every morning. A cheap and no-fuss breakfast. Also love the idea of a 'market' thats open 24hrs, selling snacks ranging from sandwiches, candy and drinks.The hotel itself is not right in the heart of downtown, its about a 10min stroll to where all the main shops area in the downtown area (and the cable cars to fisherman's wharf). We enjoyed the morning stroll down there, so was not a problem for us. Not many restaurants near by, but there is a great italian restaurant (suggested by a cabbie) to us, called Buca di Beppo, which had gigantic proportioned dishes at very reasonable prices. The food there was finger licking good. Its a couple of blocks away, so good to work up an appetite and then walk off the dinner.Hotel is also close to Moscone centre, so idea for the business traveller who has a convention etc there. Overall, a decent well priced hotel not quite in the hustle and bustle of San Fran - not too close but not too far, just right. Would recommend staying here."
65,2036,"Feb 29 2008 	Wonderful Stay	I had a very pleasant stay at the Courtyard Marriott. Though SF is known for its &quot;boutique&quot; hotels, I was skeptical of staying at an independent hotel after reading some of the reviews on here. I'm very pleased with my decision! Though a little pricier than other hotels, the extra money is worth it to be in a clean room and a great location. The lobby staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful (the concierge held my luggage while I went out for a meal and called me a car service when I left). I stayed in a queen room on the 12th floor, and my room was very spacious with an excellent view. I couldn't hear any street noise. The bed was really comfy (Courtyards are known for this!) and the shower pressure was great. My room was well-cleaned every day and new linens are always available upon request. Though there aren't many extra frills, I felt the Courtyard provided great value for the money.Best of all, the hotel is very conveniently located -- just a few blocks from public transport, and within walking distance of the SFMOMA, Yerba Buena Center, Ferry Building, cable cars, and lots of good shopping &amp; restaurants.The only complaint I have is that they seemed to be doing work on the floor above me. After a delayed arrival late at night, I had been looking forward to sleeping in, but a loud banging noise woke me up at 9 am. However, this seemed to be an isolated incident, as it was only an issue for one morning, and the rest of my stay more than made up for this minor inconvenience. I would certainly recommend this hotel!"
66,2036,Jan 29 2008 	Nice visit.	Good Location if South of Market is where you want to be. walking distance to Moscone Conv Ctr and some nice restaurants. Right next door to CNET headquarters and close to JPMorgan Chase.
67,2036,"Jan 21 2008 	San Francisco weekend	We had two rooms with family and a 13 month-old baby. Staff, especially Sam, were very efficient, courteous and cheerful. Our rooms were quite large and impeccably clean. The decor and furnishings are current and very tasteful. The food and staff in the grill and Jasmine Room were excellent. Overall, it was a wonderful stay in San Francisco"
68,2036,"Jan 19 2008 	Top Notch Hotel	The room was very clean, and large. I checked out some friends' hotels, and yes, mine was LARGE. The bed was very comfortable. The shower was, like most hotels, pretty lousy and at the right height for a child. In room internet fluctuated between 400kb/s download and 50kb/s. Room service did a good job each day. Supplied soaps/shampoos etc were quite good also.The hotel gym and pool looked pretty good - although I didn't use either. A laundry room is available for guests, which I rather like.It's pricey, but a nice hotel, in walking distance to the Moscone centre. Surrounding streets appeared safe at all hours of the day and night. Views were impressive."
69,2036,"Jan 19 2008 	Excellent clean hotel good location but you will walk a bit	An excellent hotel and a good location, but like a previous reviewer mentioned, you will have a bit of a walk to MUNI/BART but I personally love the location.I was here on NYE and the hotel's computer system broke down; the staff were working so hard, always courteous and truly apologetic and making sure everybody was taken care of in turn. I've stayed at this hotel several times now; the value is great, there's some great restaurants very close by, and it's always clean and the staff are first rate."
70,2036,"Jan 15 2008 	Clean Comfortable Great location	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Marriot December 27 - December 31, 2007.I am originally from the Bay Area (East Bay) and enjoy flying back to San Francisco for the fun city/tourist attractions.That being said, I did not want to stay near Fisherman's Wharf as it is a little 'too touristy' for me...but I didn't want to stay in a desolate part of the city either.I was EXTREMELY impressed with the Courtyard Marriot. The lobby is clean, modern, and feels brand new. Starbucks also shares the lobby with the hotel which is convenient and an added bonus. The rooms are spacious with a King bed, loveseat, desk, coffee table, dresser, etc. I had no complaints with the room.It was only a 5-7 minute walk to Union Square and other attractions. We walked down the street and found plenty to eat also. Bodin bread bowls, local taverns, etc. It took us only 10 minutes to walk to the W hotel for a trendy cocktail for happy hour and other upscale martini bars. It is easy walking places because there is so much to see while doing so. Late at night we took a taxi back to the hotel which is very inexpensive.It is a great hotel considering you will pay the same amount of money (if not more) for an older, rundown, outdated hotel near the wharf/Union Square areas. This hotel is extremely clean and well worth the price.I will definitely stay here again when returning to the city!"
71,2036,"Jan 9 2008 	Great hotel if you don't mind a little walking	Great hotel. Clean, comfortable, quiet, friendly and helpful staff. Big room. The only downside was that it's kind of off the beaten track. But if you don't mind a 10-minute walk to/from public transportation each day (BART and MUNI), I would definitely recommend this hotel."
72,2036,"Jan 8 2008 	surprisingly luxurious	Courtyard by Marriott as a brand is schizophrenic: In the suburbs, they offer a bland, standard experience, but some of their big city hotels approach luxury. I've now stayed in two that surprised me: this hotel and a Courtyard in Philadelphia located in an historic building that was formerly a courthouse.The Courtyard San Francisco downtown is located in the uber-trendy South of Market district, surrounded by dot com businesses. It's walking distance to the Ferry Building and Union Square, but barely. (warning: I walk all over San Francisco and think Fisherman's Wharf is walking distance from downtown, so I've attempted to put myself in your walking shoes while writing this review.)Unlike suburban Courtyards, they offer room service, a lobby restaurant and bar, and even a Starbucks. In other words, expect a big-city hotel experience. Of course that also means you'll pay extra for parking and internet.Courtyard has entered the &quot;signature bed&quot; competition, and while theirs is not as nice as Westin's &quot;Heavenly Bed&quot;, theirs was a definite upgrade from hotel standard and quite comfy.I picked this hotel for one reason - price. But now that I've stayed there, I'd go back for the service."
73,2036,Dec 26 2007	Great Stay even with construction!	This hotel was great for location for downtown but if you are shopping or going to restaurants its not a good choice for location. We were very pleased with the staff and the cleaniness of the whole property. There were a few stains on the couch and chair in the room but that is expected with normal wear and tear on the rooms. I thought the Front Desk staff was great. Check in was fast and easy. We did not know at the time of booking the resrevation that there was construction going on so they infromed us at check in. I would have never known about it if they didn't tell us. There was no noise and not a sight of construction workers there. We would come back to this hotel any time. I think the only thing that was outrageously ridiculous was the cost of parking. I think it was $40 for one night. Crazy!But all in all it was a wonderful stay!
74,2036,"Dec 24 2007 	Very nice!	We are just back from a 4 night stay at the Courtyard. We took the Bart from SFO and walked with our suitcases 3 blocks on a slight incline to the hotel. The hotel is very clean and nice, we had 2 adults and 2 teens in a King Suite, there was plenty of room. We had a great view, the bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean and neat. The staff was also very helpful. My only complaint is the noise from the outside. We were on the 14 floor facing 2nd Ave, the sirens, car horns and construction noises in the morning and during rush hour was horrible. Directly in front of the hotel is the route to the bay bridge, this is where all of the traffic comes from, there is also lots of construction going on in the immediate area. Other than the outside noise, I would recommend the Courtyard"
75,2036,"Nov 10 2007	great modern clean city hotel	how could virtually every hotel room be booked in San Francisco in Nove ? well they were and no deals to be had for a somewhat last minute booking. I tried Priceline for several days and had bid up to $200.00 for a 4 star before gaving up! (we got a room at the Meridien for under $150 back in the summer).Anyway, so had to fork out a total of $364.00 !! ouch, that really hurt! I'd a been lucky enough to have gotten a room here a year or two ago through Priceline for about $120.00 so knew the place was very clean and modern. this a very nice hotel, very fast check in, large spcious lobby, modern adequate rooms, clean and quiet. on the down side, I would never stay agian at that price, the room was $279 + parking at $40.00 + a parking tax ! of $5.60 + city tax of another $40.00!! ... this is theft ! Staying in the city is a rich mans hobby ! when you throw in dinner and all the other extra's it's an extremely expensive night!"
76,2036,"Oct 23 2007 	Great stay at the Courtyard San Francisco Downtown	My wife and I were attending a conference at the Moscone centre, and this hotel was the cheapest within the region ($250), likely because it is a few blocks away from the real action (Union Square, Westfield Shopping Mall, Moscone centre). However, if you are capable of walking a few blocks (5-10 minutes) you can reach all of the above very easily, and we quite liked the location. We took the BART train from the S.F. airport, and got off at Montgomery St station, which was a four block walk from this hotel. Even with baggage this wasn't bad. I went for a run a couple of times - just headed down Folsom St for a few blocks and was at the Embarcadero which is great for jogging.As mentioned in many previous reviews, we were genuinely impressed with the service offered here. Very helpful staff. We did not eat at the hotel's restaurant at all, because we had other plans. There is a Starbuck's right inside the hotel lobby, which was handy for a quick breakfast.The room was huge - especially for San Fran! The big bathroom was also very much appreciated.In contrast to a previous poster, we did not have any technological gadgets in our room. Just a plain (non-flat screen) TV. The free Internet was nice, and the Ethernet cable is in the closet.Overall, we were impressed with this hotel, and we would return, especially if for another conference at the Moscone Centre. That being said, if shopping is your thing, other hotels are much closer to Union Square. We had to take a cab back to our hotel a couple of times since we had so much stuff!"
77,2036,"Oct 7 2007 	Great Location Great Comfort	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights so he could attend the dental convention at the Moscone Center. This hotel was perfectly located for him to walk to the convention, and for me to walk to public transportation in order to visit all the &quot;touristy&quot; sights of San Francisco. We loved being in the center of town, and I loved being walking distance to the Tram buses that went to the wharves (including the Ferry Building and Pier 39) and, of course, the Cable Cars. Buy yourself a 3 day pass for the MUNI bus/tram/cable car system while you are there for $18. Now for the hotel itself: the staff was extremely kind and helpful. We had breakfast every morning at the hotel restaurant. They are very efficient, and very willing to go out of their way to get you what you want (we shared a breakfast 2 mornings as the portions are generous). The front desk staff greeted me every time I walked back in the door from my touring around. Even the maid stopped to thank me for leaving her a tip. The room itself was large for San Francisco, with 2 queen beds, a couch, desk, etc. Very clean. Bed was extremely comfortable, which for me means, not as hard as a rock. Wanted a view room, but they were packed. Never heard a sound from the rooms on either side of us. Free internet (cable is in a plastic bag hanging in the closet). Overall an excellent experience in San Francisco. If you are planning a visit, go in October. We've been there twice at that time of year and the weather is excellent. Sunny and 70 most of the time we were there. Have fun!"
78,2036,"Oct 7 2007 	Clean Comfortable and in a safe area	I stayed at the Courtyard Sept 27-30 for a business trip. It was the weekend of the ADA Convention so the room was $354 a night! The room was typical Courtyard style with not much frills. The pictures on the web showed flat screen tv's and modern furniture...I had two different rooms and neither looked like the pictures. Both rooms had regular tv's and plain looking furniture. Although I must say both rooms were spotless and very quiet.The hotel is in a pretty good location, several blocks from good shopping (Westfield mall) and about 4 blocks to Moscone. If you are going to SanFran for a convention at Moscone I reccomend the W, the Westin Market St, or the Marriott. All are MUCH closer to Moscone......I tried to get in these places but all were booked. If you can get a good rate and have great walking shoes, I would recommend this hotel. But it wasn't worth $350 a night when they are plenty of other great hotels in the city."
79,2036,"Sep 4 2007 	Fantastic hotel!	This hotel is a terrific place to stay. It's relatively affordable and is walking distance to the ferry/farmers market. It's also near a Bart station. I love how the rooms are huge! We got a king size bed and there was an area for a pull out sofa bed. The bathrooms were extremely clean. The front desk staff and valet attendants are very friendly-- you could tell that the hotel values customer service. The rooms are quiet, and their amenities are great. They have a pool and a jacuzzi (although the jacuzzi wasn't working when I was there, boo), an exercise room and a restaurant and bar.I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in downtown San Francisco!"
80,2036,"Aug 29 2007 	High-Tech Amenities	I stayed at the Courtyard San Francisco Downtown for a few days in August 2007. The rooms are clean and large for city standards (300+ sq. feet). The bathrooms are unusually large. The toilet is at least 3-4 feet from the shower, which is a nice change from those closet bathrooms. The sink area (only one sink) is outside of the bathroom, but has space to put your toiletries. The room has air conditioning and the view is decent (I had a city view). There is a sofa bed in the room too (full size bed).The best part of this hotel is the high-tech gadgets. My room had a flat panel LCD HDTV. Internet service is free, but make sure you bring your own Ethernet cable because they didn't provide one in the room. The desk is huge. It has a pull-out desk which pulls out from under the main desk. You can place your laptop and a stack of papers on the pull-out desk and still have room on the main desk behind it to store even more papers, etc. The office chair is very comfortable too. The back of the desk has a power, A/V and network/phone panel. You can plug a phone cable, ethernet cable, audio and video (RCA jacks, audio mini-plug, S-video, HDMI and VGA) plugs, 4 power plugs, and a USB port into that panel. The clock radio is modern and you can plug in your IPOD into it.Since the hotel is on 2nd and Folsom, it is not in the middle of the tourist area. If you want to be in downtown/Union Square area, try the Marriott on 4th and Mission St., the Four Seasons, the Palace Hotel, etc. However, you will be paying at least 2x more. Union Square is walking distance away (about 8 long blocks) and the Metreon/Moscone Center is about 4 blocks away. There are some great restaurants near the hotel. Try Bong Su (Vietnamese Fusion) and Cha Am (Thai) on 3rd and Folsom, Mehfil (Indian) across the street, Osha (Thai) on 2nd between Folsom and Howard), Azie (Asian fusion) and Lulu (Mediterranean) on Folsom between 4th and 5th."
81,2036,"Aug 20 2007 	Wonderful Modern Lovely Stay	We spent two nights at the Courtyard in San Francisco and really enjoyed our stay. The staff was polite and very accomadating. Our room (we were in a king suite) was perfect for our family. It had a large sitting room with a modern-looking sofa bed, lounging sofa (which also could be made into a bed), as well as a large seperate bedroom with a king and a bathroom with two sinks, as well as a seperate shower/toilet area. The sitting room had a nice LCD, flatscreen, TV in it, and the bedroom also had a TV. The pool was nice and kept clean and the exercise room was well equipped with great workout machines (each of the treadmills, stairsteppers and bicycles had there own TVs built into them). We ate breakfast at Jasmine's on both days of our stay. The buffet was always fresh and delicious. The location is in the business district of San Francisco, but we walked to the farmer's market and piers, but it was a bit of a hoof . For those who aren't walkers, cable cars and buses are a short stroll from the front entrance. For those not wanting to eat at the hotel restaurant, San Francisco has great cuisine that definitely needs to be had. During our visits to the city in the past, we've enjoyed great Chinese food (China Town), as well as lots of other ethinic types. Across the street from the Courtyard is a great Indian restaurant whose name I forget, but it's literally across the street and can't be missed. In the Ferry Building in the Slanted Door. We decided to dine at this hip Thai restaurant. It was delicious. It's not cheap, but we found it definitely worth the splurge. The Courtyard is very up to date with wonderful staff and all at relatively good price. We'll be back!"
82,2036,"Aug 1 2007 	Quiet relaxing and friendly	Stayed at the hotel for a long business/pleasure weekend and was very impressed. The property is very clean and upscale, while the staff is friendly and accommodating. Room service was the fastest I've ever experienced at a hotel and offered a nice selection for breakfast and dinner.Room wise, the plasma TV was great and the mini-fridge (as opposed to a stocked mini-bar) is fantastic...allows you to keep what you want (there's a nice liquor store right across the street from the entrance for stocking it).The one thing I did notice was that the mattresses are not very firm. Not a problem for me personally, but it wasn't to my partner's liking.Yes, parking is expensive, but it's SF. Every time I called for my car, it was there in less than 5 minutes, so that was great.Overall, it was a great place to stay, just a short (about 10-minute) walk from Market Street and Union Square."
83,2036,"Jul 31 2007	Wonderful hotel and staff	The staff is great and the hotel is very nice. We stayed a week and everyone at the hotel was very nice. Nicole made sure we were happy with our room and changed our locatin, at our request, to a different floor. Our room was always clean and beds were wonderful. The only hotel that we found with 2 queen beds. We found the location ok, because we used public transportion and had to walk several blocks to catch a bus.A wonderful stay."
84,2036,"Jul 24 2007 	Great Location and Great Service!	Great Hotel, and Great Location! My husband and I used Marriott points to stay at the Courtyard this past Saturday and could not have been happier with the room and the service. The room was basic and standard for a Marriott. However, the location cannot be beat. The hotel is blocks away from the Sony Metreon Center, the Moscone Center, and the new SF Ballpark. Our favorite thing about the neighborhood is the fact that there are several great microbreweries just blocks away. The pool is a nice feature at the hotel, but it was too packed with screaming brats for us to enjoy. Overall a great find of a hotel in SF."
85,2036,"Jul 20 2007 	Quiet!	We (2 adults and two young children) stayed here for a week.The hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful. Our room was two queen beds and one sofa sleeper. Spacious, quiet and clean. There are several good restaurants for grown-ups but not for the family around the hotel. Valet parking was $43 a day!"
86,2036,"Jun 21 2007 	Great Service Expensive Parking	I stayed here for business for 3 nights. The rooms were great, the location was great, and the staff was excellent. My only complaint was the $30/night parking fee. I know parking is a premium in San Fran, but when it costs a 4th of what you are paying for the room, that is a bit ridiculous."
87,2036,"Jun 18 2007	Great staff	Excellent and helpfull staff, good location, expensive but good quality valet parking. Good nearby liquor store and restaurents."
88,2036,"Jun 4 2007 	Loved the Courtyard	We've stayed at Courtyard's before but this one was really great. Nice lobby,outside courtyard &amp; lounge. The restaurant was pretty expensive for what you get &amp; the waiter wasn't very good either. We liked breakfast from Starbucks better, which is located by the front desk.The employees at the front desk were helpful &amp; friendly, especially Richard. We asked for a refrigerator &amp; one was brought to our room right away.As others have mentioned the location is great, especially for the price of the rooms. Our room was spacious,quiet &amp; very clean (12th flr). View wasn't great but we were only there to sleep.You can't go wrong staying here"
89,2036,"May 9 2007 	Awesome Hotel and Location	I stayed here the 1st weekend in March and enjoyed a unsually warm SF weekend. The hotel is extremely clean and in a great location. It is within walking distance to the new shopping mall, Union Square, Moscone, SOMA district, museums and Chinatown.There is a small indoor pool, nice courtyard on the lower level, along with a restaurant and Starbucks. Everyone working at the hotel was very nice. Valet parking is $40 per day, in a covered garage. Worth the fee since parking is difficult to find in the area. I would stay here again next time I visit SF, especially since the price is so reasonable!"
90,2036,"Apr 14 2007 	Great time at the Marriott Courtyard San Francisco Downtown	Nice hotel and great location. My friend and I (2 ladies) felt safe walking around. However, just note that skid row is on Mission, between 6th and 7th street. Only about a 15 - 20 mins walk to Chinatown or Union Square. Ample of shopping close by. Excellent location for transportation since it is a close walk to the BART, cable cars, trolley and MUNI stations. The only thing we did not like about our room was the bathroom since the sink was located outside the bathroom and the view. We were on the 7th Floor and when we looked out the window, the view was blocked by the office building next door. Try to get a higher floor. Other than that, it was very clean and comfortable. Great value for the money we paid."
91,2036,Apr 4 2007	loved the Marriott Courtyard on 2nd 	This is not only a better than average hotel but the location was great too. We booked through Expedia (air &amp; hotel combo) so it was a great price. It is only 3 blocks from Market and a10 minute walk from Union Square (major shopping area). We ate in the bar/restaurant and had a good meal. The Starbucks hours of operation are less than appealing but that didn't diminish our feelings about the hotel. VERY comfortable beds (they have just upgraded all of the beds) and ample sized rooms. The workout room is great but you have to get there early.The whole experience at the hotel was delightful.
92,2036,Mar 28 2007 	Great Place to Stay	I had a wonderful time at the Marriott Courtyard. It is located in a safe area and is in proximity to a lot of restaurants. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The only bad thing about this hotel is that there isn't a mini refrigerator in the rooms.
93,2036,"Mar 19 2007 	Great Hotel Great Location	We stayed here two nights over a weekend and at $90 a night in the center of SF you really can't beat it. It was super clean, comfortable and with excellent Marriott service. I've stayed at other hotels in the area and paid a lot more and gotten a lot less. Last time we paid the same amount and didn't even have a private bath! We will definitely stay here again. I think during the week it is more expensive due to it being a business hotel. We got a &quot;weekend rate&quot;. Highly recommended hotel. The only downside is that parking costs $40 plus tax! Crazy. But we beat this by parking in another part of the city for free and got to the hotel on foot. We used the extra $40 on dinner."
94,2036,"Mar 19 2007 	Great location and value	Excellent location, short walk to Market, off 2nd and Folsom, easy access to all areas of San Francisco and highway.Great value booking through Orbits, 89$ for two queen beds, one week in advance prepay.Parking is extra, 38$ per day plus tax, only valet available, but great value for area as unlimited in/out privileges. Well equipped small fitness room, pool is only 3.5 ft deep so for kids only, no steam room/sauna.Starbucks on siteHigh speed cable internet complimentary"
95,2036,"Mar 19 2007 	Great stay great price	I first booked a king room on Marriott's corporate site for $99. I browsed on Expedia and saw the same room for $90. Fortunately, Marriott Corp. has a &quot;Best Price Guarantee&quot; where they will honor the lower rate, and take an additional 25% off. My room ended up to be $67 per night ($77.10 with all taxes).Pros:1) Free high-speed internet (cables are in the closet).2) Clean basic room3) Prompt front desk, with numerous agents to help.4) Speedy elevator5) Starbucks in the lobby6) 3-4 city blocks to the BART &amp; Muni lines.7) Liquor store across the st., 24 Hour gym, Quiznos within steps of the lobby.8) Speedy check-outCons:1) As with all hotels, egg breakfast is $17.99"
96,2036,"Mar 5 2007 	Great place to stay in SOMA	I stayed at the Courtyard Downtown for six nights during a business trip. The hotel is nicely located, a few blocks south of Market Street and an easy walk to the financial district, Union Square, and the Embarcadero. It is a surprisingly nice hotel for the price, especially so close to downtown San Francisco. The whole place feels brand new and is very clean and bright throughout. The rooms themselves are big and comfortable, and well appointed with little touches like free high-speed internet and Bath &amp; Body Works products. The front desk staff were also extraordinarily helpful and friendly. The airline lost my bag on the flight over, and the front desk staff was very accomodating with the various packages from FedEx and the airline that I had to receive over the first few days as I was waiting for my bag to be delivered. The only drawback to the hotel is that there aren't a lot of services, like pharmacies and restaurants, on the immediate surrounding block. The walk from Market Street back to the hotel is also a little quiet at night, but never felt unsafe.I highly recommend the Courtyard Downtown for anyone looking for a nice, modern hotel at a much lower price than comparable hotels in the neighborhood."
97,2036,"Feb 22 2007 	great convention location	I had a very nice stay at this hotel for a convention at the Moscone Center. I don't like fancy or glitzy, so this place was just my speed. The room was clean, really big, great price for its perfect location-- safe, and a short walk to work. The longer walk to shopping/restaurants at Union Square was a good way to stretch my legs after a hard day's work. I highly recommend the Umbria Restaurant a block way. The pool and hot-tub were great, good exercise room, too. Free internet service a huge plus. The bellmen were exceptionally helpful, even arranging a car to deliver my luggage to where I'd be working late in the day (not at Moscone) and take me directly to the airport, so that I did not need to return to the hotel to p/u luggage. I work in SF a couple times a year and will definitely stay at this hotel again."
98,2036,"Jan 15 2007 	Great value in downtown	Wow! This was a fabulous hotel in the heart of the city. Located in a relatively new area of SF close to the China Basin and within walking distance of the heart of downtown, cable cars, and public transportation. The accomodations were wonderful. I thought we were staying at a five star hotel.Only slight downside is that you will walk 4-5 blocks to get to most tourist areas but that is expected in SF and actually is part of the fun part of being there. If you are attending a Giants game this is the place to stay (only 10 minute walk) and very safe.Hotel accomodations are great. Nice and comfortable rooms, nice indoor pool (which is hard to find in SF), and Starbucks right in the lobby. Lots of restaurants and nightlife in the vicinity.Would recommend this to anyone."
99,2036,"Jan 8 2007 	Good Location Great Value	My wife and I stayed in the hotel from December 28 - January 1. We were very pleased with almost everything about this hotel.The check-in desk was very efficient and friendly. Our room was ready for us upon arrival at 2:00 p.m. Location: The hotel is not in a highly touristed area, which, in some ways, worked to our advantage. We never thought we were mobbed by other tourists all trying to do the same thing. Having said that, Market Street and Mission Street were just a few blocks away.Hotel Amenities: There is a small Starbucks in the hotel lobby. It was, unfortunately, only open until 3 p.m. which seemed too early. Perhaps it had special hours because of the holidays. There was a lobby bar that was open from 5 p.m. - 11 p.m. The food was expensive but they had a good beer selection and the staff was super friendly.We did not try the restaurant for breakfast.There was a small fitness center and good sized swimming pool. The pool area was a little dark, however and didn't lend itself to hanging out. The pool was warm and the hot tub was welcome after a day of sightseeing.Room: It was a very typical &quot;Courtyard&quot; room. No refrigerator and the TV was in a surprisingly awkward location for watching from bed. Excellent heat/ac system. We had a king bed and the room also had a love seat. If we had a complaint about the room it was the the light switches were in confusing locations and there were too few electrical outlets for the various laptops, cellphones, battery chargers, etc. that we had with us. Marriott should be commended for the high speep internet access that they provide for free in the rooms. Very useful for checking flights, looking up museum hours and ferry times, etc.Other items: There are a number of good restaurants nearby. We had New Year's dinner at The Fly Trap, less than a half block away and it was excellent. There is a liquor store directly across the street. There were a number of &quot;fast food&quot; places within easy walking distance (beside the Starbucks, the closest was a Subway and a local Mexican place). Taxis were almost always available outside and the valet also had towncars available. Gray Line picked up and dropped off in front of the hotel if you book a tour with them.This hotel is a great location if you are doing things in the vicinity of Yerba Linda Gardens, the Moscone Center, the Metreon, and the Westfield Mall. They are all within 6 blocks or so.This Courtyard seemed of a much higher calibre than the one near Pier 39/Fishermen's Wharf."
100,2036,"Nov 24 2006 	Very Nice Courtyard	My husband and I stayed at the Courtyard for 3 nights in October. We were in town for a conference and didn't want to stay at the two main hotels for the conference. Courtyard was our 2nd choice, but we were happy with our pick. This Courtyard is one of the largest that I've stayed at and I thought it was slightly more &quot;upscale.&quot; There is a pool and gym- small but adequate. Our room overlooked a courtyard, was a nice size and the furnishings were in good condition. The one negative was that the walls are a bit thin.........Staff was very friendly and helpful. The weather was wonderful, so my husband didn't mind the 5-10 minute walk to the Moscone Center for the conference. The Courtyard was a 10-15 minute walk to the Ferry Building and Union Square.All in all, we were very happy with our stay. We would stay there again and would recommend it."
101,2036,"Nov 10 2006 	Short but sweet stay	I, my sister, and our husbands stayed at this hotel as part of a whirlwhind tour of CA. We only stayed for 1 night, but the hotel was a very pleasant surprise.First, this Courtyard feels more like a full-service Marriott in that it is in a single, high-rise building. It is a very busy hotel, but service was very good.Our room was a 1 bedroom suite. It was extremely large, and very comfortable. The layout was a bit strange in that the access to the bathroom was through the bedroom portion of the suite. Accordingly, the privacy of the bedroom was somewhat diminished.The king-sized bed in the bedroom was very comfortable. Furnishings throughout the suite were in excellent condition. Carpets were very clean, and the suite itself felt very clean. Sofa pull-out bed was fairly comfortable.The living room portion of the suite was large, with a fridge and large bar area. We order room service, which came promptly and was tasty for hotel food. Prices were about average for hotel and the area in general.The lobby area always feels extremely busy. There is a Starbucks in the lobby; it too was busy, busy.In short, this was a good hotel, with most of the amenities available in a full-service Marriott. I would not be surprised if Marriott ceased operating this as a Courtyard location. I would stay here again."
102,2036,"Oct 19 2006 	The place to stay!	We were supposed to stay at the Warwick Regis, but they were 'double booked' so they sent us to the Courtyard by Marriott. We were very happy with the vallet, the front desk and the cleanliness and shape of the room. The front desk was very accomodating for all of our needs. When they realized we were sent from another motel and that we were on our honeymoon, they set us up with a room with a gorgous view of the city. They were perfect for answering questions about tourist sites, they let us check out late and the vallet let us leave our car there 2 hours later than we should have. The vallet even took items to and from our car for us. If I ever travel to San Francisco again, I will be staying at this motel."
103,2036,Oct 9 2006 	Great hotel	Loved the Courtyard in San Fran... It was a nice walk to the city centre and from there we were able to catch the cable car to Fisherman's Wharf. The staff were couteous and helpful and the room was clean and spacious. This is a great spot to stay and has a fantastic little bar near the lobby.
104,2036,"Sep 13 2006 	good value !	We stayed 6 nights last august. This stay has been booked on Priceline (great value : 65 USD). The hotel was very good : clean, large room, baby crib on demand, Starbuck on the lobby...The only &quot;bad&quot; thing for us is the location : not really in the financial district (10mn walk) - not a lot of restaurants around (good Indian just in the front of the hotel)."
105,2036,"Aug 30 2006 	Good location	The bad first: We stayed two nights and were shocked by the cost of parking at the hotel - $38 a day. We did so anyway, since we were told by the valet that nearby outdoor parking lots required us to move the car out at 6:30 every morning and there was no street parking available. We didn't want the hassle.Now for the good: The hotel is located in a busy area of downtown but not in the center which is a 10 minute walk. The decor of the lobby was nice and clean and check-in was easy. Our room didn't have a view but it was comfortable and cozy. The concierge was friendly and helpful in recommending nearby places to eat and we enjoyed getting our coffee at the downstairs Starbucks every morning. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay, except for the parking fee sticker shock. The best thing to do is not to drive into downtown San Francisco if possible. We would stay here again if we didn't drive."
106,2036,"Aug 29 2006 	Safe and friendly	Our family (2 adults and 2 teenagers) stayed here for 3 nights at the end of July. The room was fairly typical and nothing special but it was clean. The hotel is in a very safe area and we felt perfectly happy walking around at night. The staff were incredibly helpful. The hotel has interesting touches around the lobby, bar and lounge areas which are copper/brass items placed around, e.g. a pair of slippers in front of the fire and a cat curled up. The pool was very nice (if smaller than I expected) and there was a small terrace outside that overlooks the central courtyard. The courtyard itself was a pleasant place to sit and all the public areas were well kept up. We didn't eat in the hotel as it was expensive but there were lots of places within walking distance to eat at. I would recommend this hotel."
107,2036,"Aug 14 2006 	A little better than your typical Courtyard	I'm a big fan of Marriott properties and have stayed at Courtyard hotels all over the west coast. While I usually like Courtyard, I loved this property.While most courtyard hotels are 3-4 stories, this Courtyard is 18+ stories tall. It does have a courtyard area, and the rooms facing the courtyard are very quiet, with no street or traffic noise. For some reason, if your room faces the courtyard, you cannot open the windows. However, if your room faces the noisy street below, you can open your windows.The check in area is more nicely appointed than most courtyards. The breakfast/restaurant area is better too, and includes an omelet bar and waiter service that is more typical in a restaurant than in the courtyard. Unlike most courtyard hotels, this property has room service that will prepare and deliver hot meals. They have a business center that allows you to access the internet and print pages free of charge.We stayed in one of their courtyard facing rooms for one night and then moved to a street facing suite for the second night (because I like fresh air and wanted to open the windows). Both rooms were nicely appointed and clean, but there was noticable street noise from the second room, even on the 15th floor. Unlike most courtyard properties, both rooms offered a heating and AC system that was more like a residential unit, as opposed to the &quot;in wall&quot; system that you typically find in a Courtyard property. This was important to me because the in wall systems are quite noisy, while the system in both rooms were very quiet. Both rooms were a bit small compared to what a Courtyard usually offers, but the room size was quite typical for SF at a more reasonable price.Be warned that they charge about $45 per day for valet parking ($38 plus tax, I think) and have no self-parking, but this is typical of all downtown San Francisco hotels. The per person breakfast charge was higher than most courtyards ($18 per head), but children under 12 eat free. In SF, everything is more expensive, so I was willing to forgive both.In all, I liked this property a lot. The decor was modern, clean, and pleasant. The amenities exceeded the typical Courtyard amenities. The price was quite reasonable for San Francisco, which is generally a very expensive City to stay in."
108,2036,"Jul 25 2006 	Just another Courtyard on the inside	Let me start by saying that I stayed here using Marriott Rewards Points from July 20 to July 23, 2006. So I cannot judge the value of my stay.If you have seen one Courtyard hotel room, you have seen them all. Furnishings were fairly new but uninspiring. Bathroom was basic. Sink area was too small for two people. Typical Courtyard with basic features. Nothing new to report about this Courtyard.The property itself is kept very clean. Check-in was a breeze. Although, I did request to be upgraded to a suite but the front desk clerk informed me that they were completely booked. I did not challenge the clerk, but I logged on the Marriott website before arriving and it showed availability for suites during my stay. I am an elite member and they choose to ignore my request. We had a nice City View with a view of they &quot;pyramid&quot; building on the 14th floor.Soap and shampoo were no name brands unlike other Marriott properties which use Bath and Body Works products. If you are picky about hair products like I am, be sure to bring your own.The Courtyard is in easy walking distance to AT&amp;T Park and the Muni/BART Station (15 to 20 minutes). If you are walking from the Muni/BART Station, I recommend walking on the north side of 2nd Street. For some reason, this side is more developed and nicer. The homeless tend to stay on the southside during the evenings. Union Square is one Muni/BART station away.We found a great Thai restuarant on 2nd street a couple blocks away called Osha. Roys is also a couple blocks away also. Starbuck in lobby is convenient but hours limited. You can charge your drinks and food to your room.To summarize, a typical Courtyard. Room very clean and comfortable. Free wired internet in the rooms."
109,2036,"Jul 14 2006	Loved it!!	Traveled to SFO last month with my husband and daughter. We had conisdered 5 star hotels, but they are not kid friendly in SFO, so we ended up at the Courtyard. We reserved a 1 bedroom suite and were thrilled! The living area was huge, with fridge/micro, tv and computer access line, it had a large window looking across the street at another building. The bedroom had its own tv and 2 large windows, one of which looked out towards the skyline. We loved that all windows could be opened to allow fresh air. This Courtyard had the standard Marriott set up in terms of excellent mattresses, choice of down or foam pillows, white linens that are washed for every new guest. My daughter stayed on the fold out sofabed in the living room, which was fine. The only thing I would say to management is that in such a large room, why not put 2 of those couches? it would be good for both extra seating and sleeping. OK, so the decor is a bit plain jane, but very pleasant and non-distracting. But the place is SPOTLESS. And the service from everyone was amiable and efficient. One morning our daughter put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door on our way out without telling us. When we got back around lunch time the room wasn't made up, of course, but within minutes we got a call from housekeeping asking us if we'd like the room cleaned. They showed up at the appointed time and everything was sparkiling as usual when we got back. Coming from the east coast we had a late check in, and it was nice that room service was available so late. Even here the staff was so sweet--they brought vanilla ice cream instead of chocolate, and when I pointed it out the waitress offered to run down and bring an EXTRA scoop of chocolate. Lovely doormen and parking valets. Do yourself a favor, though--don't park there--it really is $50 per night. There's a lot across the street that's self park and much less. And yes the bottles of Fiji spring water are $4 each, but you can get the same exact water at a Walgreens on Market St. a few blocks away. That Walgreens also has snacks and breakfast food, which worked out because the very nice breakfast buffet is $17 per person. We made out though--one afternoon the computer broadband line was not working, and then the cable box was not working either, so the repair person not only replaced everything, he gave us buffet vouchers for breakfast the next morning. Nice touch. Also nice was the indoor heated pool (a big deciding factor for us-many of the 5 stars don't allow kids in their pools) and a small gym, perfect for a quick workout and dip and good incentive to keep the daily whining to a minimum (as in &quot;Walk up the hill and then you can go for a swim when we get back&quot;). I can't say enough good things about this hotel--we will definitely go back there. Even the pricing was reasonable considering the level of service and location."
110,2036,"Jul 4 2006	Great for family of 4	Definitely excellent choice for families if you have a car. Stayed for two nights over a weekend at the Courtyard. For $169 on Marriott got a 2 room suite, corner room. It is true that the location is safe but not in the middle of all the expected tourist locations....so it was very nice to have our car. The location was also very quiet which is great for napping toddlers. Could see SBC park where the Giants play from our window, about 5 blocks away. Room very clean, service prompt and extremely friendly. Front desk personnel almost overcome with sorrow that they only had one serving of free Colgate toothpaste...no problem just used the kids' that we had brought. Restaurant personnel engaging, unobtrusive. Although the breakfast buffet was expensive ($19/person), selection great and they didn't charge us for the kids! Room service excellent, prompt and in line with what one expects room service pricing. After exhaustive research for us the best deal for 2 room suite with a door between us and our kids. Only downside $37/day valet parking (seems to be pretty standard for the area). Will definitely stay there next time I'm in town."
111,2036,"Jun 14 2006	Great Location Awesome Beds	Stayed here the weekend of June 9th, 2006. Great location, close to all forms of public transportation, we didn't have to rent a car. Take the BART from the airport. Three blocks from hotel. Starbucks in the lobby. Rooms were very clean and the beds were unbelievably comfortable. Spent most of the time seeing the city so this hotel was perfect for us. Close to great shopping and restaurants. Great rates as well. Would definitely go back."
112,2036,"May 29 2006	Excellent Hotel	Just got back from one night in SF at this hotel. Good location (although many hotels in this area are near to everything, so don't choose this just because of location). Excellent staff--very courteous. Stayed on the top floor (18) with a nice view. Room was spacious and clean, all you could ask for. Price was significantly better than other hotels--actually booked on priceline bid and stayed for about 75$ including tax--see ----. Market St was only 4 blocks away (about a 5-10 min walk), then you can take a street car (1.50$) down to fisherman's wharf to see that area. Otherwise, all the shopping, etc. is near to the hotel."
113,2036,"May 28 2006	Great location and quiet	Spent a week in May 2006. Great location, came directly from the SFO airport using the BART because the Montgomery station is only 4 blocks from the hotel. Only 10 minutes walk from the Cable Car, 5 minutes from the streetcar and buses on Market street. Overall it was a very convenient location. Rooms are simple but spacious and very clean. And QUIET. Did not here a thing all 7 nights we stayed there. Breakfast buffet is good and practical for an early start to explore the city. Staff is very courteous and friendly. Used a safety deposit box at the reception desk for passports, there are no safes in the rooms ( minor detail). No fees . Great thai restaurant 2 blocks from the hotel ( Osha Thai Restaurant ). It's opened late even on weekdays. Excellent food.Enjoyed our stay and will recommend it to others. A good value for the money paid. A little bit more expensive than other hotels around but it was worth it for the tranquility, location, nice rooms and friendly staff."
114,2036,"Apr 23 2006	Great Location	This is a great little hotel. We were there for 1 night on a weekend. The location is the best, and we had a great veiw from the 10th foor. The King bed was nice and comfortable and the room clean. I had a good sleep and the hotel was quiet. It was so convenient to be able to walk to the Metreon and Union Square. They do have a Starbucks in the lobby, but I never got to take advantage of it because it was always closed. I don't know what the hours are during the week, but on Sat., it closed by 3 pm, and then on Sunday by noon. I believe that they only stay open for breakfast. Anyway, we had a great stay and I would recommend this hotel."
115,2036,"Apr 11 2006	Loved the Courtyard at Downtown	We stayed there last week of March-first week of April 2006. Incredibly great hotel. Service is excellent. We arrived late at 12.00 A.M., already let them know while booking. The front desk person was very helpful. We asked a high floor room with a view if possible. He gave us a room on 18th Floor-with VIEW!! And he also asked us if we had dinner, we were really late, he gave us the menu for a nearby pizza place and Chinese res if we want to order and have it delivered. Great. Room was really CLEAN and SPACIOUS! The hotel is in a great location itself. Only few blocks from Market street, Union Square is probably 15-20 min short walk (depending on how fast you walk!!). Oh and also China Town is not that far too! Once you are in Union Square add another 10 min of walking! We went there walking. BART station is only 4/5 blocks away, Montegemry(sp?) station. If you don't have much luggege you don't even need to waste money on cab fare to airport. We took BART to Oakland Intl' Airport! And it cost us for 2 $10.70, in cab it should have been $60.00!!! And to SFO (SF Int'l Airport) the fare was $40.00, so you save HUGE!! So yeah the hotel has the added bonus of being in a great location! All in all a great hotel. Definitely we will stay there again and again!!"
116,2036,"Jan 19 2006	Lovely and Reliable	Had a lovely one-night stay in the Courtyard Marriot in SF's SoMA district. The streets around it are rather dead on the weekend, but it still felt safe and was quiet at night. Good views from the 12th floor. Room very...roomy..and clean, of course. Hotel staff was very very courteous and accomodating (early check-in, luggage storage, etc.) Starbucks in the lobby was wonderful for a quick breakfast before heading out in the morning. Only a short walk (4 blocks) from Market St. and Union Sq also close by. SFMOMA, Yerba Buena Gardens, Sony Metreon all around the corner. Take the BART from the airport...the station is not too far of a walk. Oh, and great Thai restaurant on 2nd st. just steps from the hotel. Overally a very reliable choice for staying in the city."
117,2036,Nov 21 2005	Great hotel !!!!	We stayed at this hotel for one week in novermber 2005. The staff was very friendly and the rooms are very clean. The location of this hotel is fantastic. it's close to union square and close to sbc park and the ferry building. the breakfastbuffet was good and very friendly priced. I would recommend this hotel to everybody. It was a very pleasant stay in this great city.
118,2036,"Nov 15 2005 	Great place great location!	My wife and I stayed at the San Fran Courtyard Downtown for two nights this past week and it was just amazing! Now, given, it's not the Ritz, but if you're looking for a great place to mix business with pleasure it was ideal. The entrance to the bay bridge was just few blocks away for me to make some work appointments on the east bay and Union Square was just a very safe 8 block walk for my wife to do some shopping. We even made the 15-20 block walk down to Pier 39 and it was an easy 25 minutes. The rooms were clean and comfortable, everything you'd expect from a Courtyard. The breakfast buffet is a must, $9 a piece, but you'll be so full you'll skip lunch."
119,2036,"Nov 14 2005 	Very nice hotel and staff	Stayed here for a weekend in November. Probably one of the best beds and sheets at a chain hotel. The staff is extremely friendly. The hotel is very clean. Almost gave this an &quot;excellent&quot; rating but I had to knock it because though the wired internet is free in the rooms, the WI-FI is not free in the lobby. A very petty gripe but it takes it down in my book.Location is good. It is a nice 10-12 minute walk to Union Square. Safe location as I walked back the 10-12 minutes after midnight (Friday night). Walking towards the hotel from Market down 2nd St does not have as much &quot;people traffic&quot; but I still felt safe. A taxi from Union Square to the hotel will run about $7-$8. Make that about $10-12 for a ride to/from Pier 39 (Fisherman's Wharf area).The buffet breakfast was good. It was included in the rate so I don't know if it's a good deal or not. Coffee was nice and strong.Overall, I would stay here again. I'm including a picture of the view my room had (14th floor). It looked even better at night."
120,2036,Nov 6 2005	Great time at the Courtyard	We stayed at the Courtyard for 5 nights at the end of October / beginning of November and we really liked it.Our room on the 11th floor was very spacious - 2 double beds - nicely decorated and very tasteful. The beds were comfortable but perhaps a little soft for our tastes.Room was immaculate every day.Staff helpful.Location excellent - 10 minute walk to Union Square. Fantastic Thai Restaurant - OSHA - a couple of blocks down.Only gripe was the Starbucks - we arrived at 6pm on a Thursday and it was shut - very limited opening hours.Overall - very impressed. We got the room for 60 a night through Octopus Travel and thought it was a bargain for the quality of the hotel.
121,2036,"Oct 18 2005	Great place to stay in SOMA	I've stayed at the Courtyard Downtown several times and every time it gets better. The staff is very friendly, rooms clean and restaurant choice fair. I would like to see another restaurant but there are several within walking distance.If you are going to SF and don't need to stay near Fisherman's Wharf, this is the place to stay!"
122,2036,"Oct 17 2005	Very basic hotel	Part of a hotel chain that offers basic accomodation to travelers. Efficient services, a rather convenient mini-store, &amp; the use of coin-operated laundry room for longer stay. Should request for rooms above 9 floors, as lower-floor rooms are rather noisy. May improve on in-room amenities. No issue with internet speed."
123,2036,"Aug 31 2005	Great stay	My husband and I went to San Francisco to celebrate my birthday in August. Being the ultimate bargain hunter, I secured a reservation at the Courtyard Marriott Downtown on Priceline for $80/night for three nights($140/night on their website). The hotel was a bit further from the Union Square area than I had hoped originally, but that actually worked in our favor. The hotel was located in the financial district and very safe, we felt safe walking around the hotel and the adjoining areas at night and we actually didn't bump into any aggressive homeless persons as other travellers reported around the Union Square hotels. The valet parking was also slightly less expensive in that area ($40/day vs $45-$47) and if you had the energy to move your car in the morning at 7AM when the meters went into effect, there was plenty of free overnight street parking as well.The hotel staff were remarkably courteous and helpful. We asked for a room on a high floor with views of the city and were put in a room with a king bed on the 11th floor with a very nice city view. The room was quite large with a sitting area and work area (the hotel is mainly caters to business travellers). What I particularly enjoyed was the fitness room and pool/spa which were free of charge (other hotels charged their hotel guests a fee to use their fitness center!). Both were quite adequate too. There were also two computers in the hotel business center with free internet access and free printing which was convenient to print our airline boarding passes, although the connection was fairly slow.Overall, had a great stay there. Mariiott quality and hospitality were excellent."
124,2036,"Aug 30 2005	Wonderful for a Courtyard	I stayed here for two nights in August. We had a Flex Award, so our room and breakfast was covered, so I may have a more favorable opinion because we didn't pay very much.The lobby, bell staff and valets are very nice and helpful. They were always offering help and provided me with some very usful info on using mass transit.The lobby of the building is very nice, well decorated. There is a Starbucks in the lobby which has very limited hours on the weekend (closes very early). But there are several within walking distance that are open.Breakfast was very good, we had the buffet. I don't know if it's worth the money (ours was free), but it's as good or better than many Sheratons and Marriotts i've stayed at in the past. Good coffee and fresh omletts made to order.The room was very clean and resonably nice. We were on the 14th floor and it was very quiet. No street noise and no noise from other guests. We had a nice view of downtown.If I were spending the money on it, (usually close to $200 or more) I think I would pick a smaller boutique hotel. Especially a hotel that had cheaper parking, $40/day is outrageous but there aren't any other good options. You don't really need a car in San Francisco, the transit system is top notch. So if you can avoid driving, I would."
125,2036,"Aug 23 2005	Nothing Special	Location was decent, staff was helpful, and the lobby was nice. The rooms though were average and the bathroom was actually on the smaller side. My biggest complaint though is that the supposed high-speed internet connection was slower than molasses. Not just my room connection either, the business center was just as bad. Fairly annoying to say the least."
126,2036,"Aug 12 2005	Terrific	I stayed there mid-July and was very pleased with everything. Yes, the parking can be expensive, but worth it. They had the car there within 5 minutes the few times we needed it. Yet, it is only a few blocks from the BART station, and close to bus lines (which I highly recommend). It was a nice walk down to the Ferry Building for a casual dinner and an easy walk to MOMA. The room was very clean, with a nice view of the hills. Our maid was so accomodating and provided extra toiletries without asking. Food is so-so in the restaurants, but convienent. My 20 year old son met me in SF, so I appreciated the coin laundry....! The concierge and the front desk were very friendly and helpful. I definitely appreciated the fact that I made a reservation at a chain I had used before and it didn't let me down. If you want a clean, reliable hotel with a decent location, this is the one for you."
127,2036,"Jul 18 2005	Courtyard Downtown - wonderful	Spent 4 days at downtown Marriott Courtyard and it was very nice. While it is slightly off the beaten path (BART and bus stops about 3-4 blocks away) and further walk for cable cars, it is a VERY nice hotel. Room was a good size (although beds were rather firm), we had a nice view of the bay bridge, free breakfast in Jasmine's which was decent. Nice outside courtyard to sit in patio - wonderful fireplace inside hotel livingroom area.(which in SF it gets chilly). ALSO, they have 3 computers tucked near vending machines which guests can use for free to check email, etc... - nice surprise. Indoor pool VERY nice and water temp warm - girls loved it. They also have a Starbucks Coffee Shop inside Marriott - which I did not use - but certainly many guests did. FYI there are not too many restaurants in the closeby area - many close at dinner time. Liquor store across the street from Marriott - great if you want to get a bottle of wine - cheaper than drinking at the bar in the hotel. We used public transportation so we would walk every morning to bus stop - so did not have to pay high price for parking. Recommend MUNI passport for 3 days. Adult $15 - child $10 which is good on all public transportation (bus, cable cars, and electric trolley - NOT ferry or BART) and a GREAT deal."
128,2036,Jun 28 2005	Great Hotel	This hotel was very nice. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly. The location was great. Lots of shopping near by and the bus stop is accross the street.
129,2036,"Jun 17 2005	Overpriced parking.	Typical courtyard. Great business-traveler location. Expensive parking ($35)!!! No complimentary breakfast, which was disappointing. The staff was okay although the weekend we went, it was busy and they seemed pre-occupied. Not what we expect from the Marriott. The rooms were nothing special. Might stay there again."
130,2036,"Jun 7 2005	Great Staff	My husband and I just returned from a great weekend in San Francisco. Since we live only a couple of hours away we are able to go often. We decided years ago to never stay in the same hotel in San Francisco...even if it was a very good one. There are sooo many wonderful hotels there. We enjoy experiencing them all. So this was our first visit to the Courtyard Marriott. Every staff person we encountered were absolutly wonderful, professional and friendly. It made walking in the door after 5 hours of walking in Chinatown seem like coming home. The location is not bad, though, not right on the cable car line, it is close enough. Be sure and visit the hotels &quot;partner&quot; restaurant, the Fly-Trap. It is just around the corner. Nice place for a martini and their 3 oysters on the half shell starter while enjoying very smooth live jazz. The room was extremely clean! Spotless! Not fancy at all...just what you needed. The sink area outside the bathroom was very small. Not a bad size room for the Union Square area. Really enjoyed the outside courtyard in the lobby area. Never a problem getting an elevator. Service was extremely fast in all areas. Inside the hotel itself was very quiet. I like the fact that the window opend a bit..not much but just enough to feel the outside air. We live in the mountains and enjoy the noise of the city which is so different than home. We did not find the street noise bad at all. Only two things that I was disapointed with...The pool area was sans decor. Looked like it was planned to be hosed out 5 times a day. Very stark and cold feeling. With a few people there it got very loud. The best times to go to any hotel pool seems to be early in the morning and later at night. As someone had mentioned before, the pool water was not warm but after getting in, it was refreshing. It was very nice not to have to pay more to use the exercise area. Actually we were happy to have the pool and spa, not many hotels have a pool in this area. I think only 5 or 6. Again very clean.The one place I would have to give the hotel a black mark would be with the food. We ate breakfast in the Jasime room. Again the staff were lovely...but the food was not excepional. The menu was dull. The second day we ordered breakfast in our room. The fruit plate was dried out and looked very nasty. The Warwick Regis has an amazing fruit plate! Now, that hotel has the best chef! San Francisco has so many fantastic places to eat who would want to eat room service in your room? We do on occasion and this is not the place to order it! For dinner, hop in a cab and take a 5 minute ride to John's Grill for the Oysters Wellington. Ohsogood! I recomended this hotel as high as I did mostly because of the staff and the cleanness. And if we ever finish all the hotels in the area I will go back to the Courtyard looking forward to a nice stay and a new hotel chef for them to hire."
131,2036,"May 8 2005	Good value. Nice clean rooms quiet.	I got a good AAA rate. Nice Courtyard for an urban location. I was on a high floor but just a basic city view. I think few rooms have great views of the bridges etc. But my room was very bright, clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is pretty desolate on the weekend because it is near the business district. As a female solo traveler, I took cabs back to the hotel at night or friends dropped me off. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk up a slight hill from the Montgomery Bart station which I took from SFO airport. Good Deal! I rented a car nearby for my trip to wine country at the same rate as the airport rate. Parking is expensive so if you can try to rent a car in the city when you need it or park somewhere else. Otherwise you can get around with public transport. One thing, as a Marriott Rewards Silver guest I would expect some voucher toward my breakfast. Breakfast was not a bargain. Hilton Honors Gold gives vouchers or has free breakfast at some properties. I had a food stash from the Hampton Inn- Airport I stayed at the previous night ! A Starbucks is opening in the lobby. Not much in the immediate area for eating. Not real close to the major tourist attractions but the price was good! The hotel does provide free coffee and a free internet computer station."
132,2036,"May 4 2005	Great Hotel	This hotel was great. It was in a really convenient location for us - about 10 minutes from Union Square (and all the shops) and 10 minutes from Chinatown. The rooms were bigger than expected, and very clean and tidy. The staff were friendly and very helpful, especially when we had asked to park outside the hotel briefly to collect our luggage from the luggage store (normally, if you want to park at the hotel, it's valet parking only and costs about $30 per day)."
133,2036,"Apr 29 2005	Horrible Parking!	My fiance took me to San Francisco for my birthday and we stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Downtown in San Francisco. When we pulled up, they had no parking unless you wanted to pay a rediculous amount for vallet which was about the price for the entire hotel stay. So we found a meter outside and we had to wake up at 6:45 am to put money in the meter. It would only take money for 1 hour so we had to keep going back all morning and the front desk said we had to move our vehicle, not keep feeding the meter. Unfriendly staff and horrible parking! Do not recommend this property!"
134,2036,"Apr 17 2005	Excellent	The hotel is fantasic value. I paid 100USD a night in January. The staff are more than helpful, I visited the hotel a few days before my stay to confirm my booking and they allowed me to select a room, I asked for a high room and they offered the top floor (18) and even a choice of view city / bay bridge.The location is good, there is a Metro station at the end of Second street, which is about a 5 minute walk.There was no mini bar in the room just bottled water but at $5 a bottle bit of a miss, but otherwise it was perfect, a sofa, coffee table, desk and chair, tv, king bed, tv, separate toilet/bath/shower and free high speed internet, complete with cable! Some pictures attached. Very clean hotel."
135,2036,"Apr 2 2005	Comfortable stay in San Francisco	My family and I stayed at the Courtyard San Francisco Downtown between 3/19/05 and 3/23/05 so I could attend a conference at the Moscone Center. After considering many hotels, we selected the Courtyard Downtown and were very pleased. Pros: Within walking distance of the Moscone Center (~ 3 long blocks), Metreon and Yerba Gardens (~ 4 long blocks), several restaurants, and public transit (1 to 4 blocks depending on where you want to go). If you don't mind walking a bit further (~ 6-9 blocks), you can hit some decent shopping. I found the hotel to be in an area with less of a homeless problem than hotels closer to the Moscone Center and Union Square. The hotel is fairly new---only a couple of years old. The rooms were clean, quiet, and had excellent beds. Two conveniences we appreciated were the guest laundry (one each on the 15th and 17th floors) with free soap and reasonable charges for washer/dryer ($1/load) and a business center off of the lobby with two computers for guest use and an ATM machine. The lobby was attractive with a fireplace and a pleasant adjacent bar area for drinks in the early evening. We ate breakfast at the hotel and had room service for a late dinner one night and were pleased with the food. Parking is expensive ($35) as is the case at many hotels in San Fran. There is only valet parking on site, but there is a self-serve parking lot on Second Street at Howard (~ a block and one-half from the hotel) that is under $20. In spite of the cost, we did use the valet parking for its convenience and I can tell you that all experiences we had with the different valet parking employees were positive; I don't think we had to wait more than 3 to 5 minutes for our vehicle at any time. In fact, we were very pleased with the service and helpfulness of all employees we encountered at the hotel.Cons: Although the pool is inside, my husband and daughter found the water to be on the cold side. The only other thing I thought would have been nice would be to have had a small refrigerator in the room.All in all, we were very pleased with our experience and would definitely stay there again."
136,2036,"Mar 29 2005	Highly recommended	Just back from 4 nights at the Courtyard Downtown = excellent, newish hotel = large nicely furnished room, big bathroom = good service at the front desk and in the bar . Only downside , the area is a bit dead at night and at the weekend as it is situated in the financial district and public transport is a 5 to 10 min walk to Market St but taxis always available outside.Rack rate 199$ but if you shop around you can find this hotel for 100$ including tax.I can highly recommend this hotel"
137,2036,"Feb 27 2005	Superb value	Stayed at this hotel Feb15th for 5 nights and can not praise this hotel more highly.The facilities are top class-lovely heated swimming pool and hot tub nice lounge with coal fires and beautiful comfortable bedrooms.The staff are absolutely excellant,really friendly and helpful without being gushy.Nice location near to Union Square and the SFMOMA.For what I paid I was completely satisfied and would recommend this hotel to anyone.I really enjoyed my time in San Francisco and would love to come back and if I do I will look no further than this hotel.Forgot to mention the breakfast here is also very good as is the room service.You would have to be very picky to find fault with this hotel."
138,2036,"Feb 21 2005	What a great hotel!	My wife and I traveled on 02/16 for 4 nights to this hotel. We had a great time. The staff was very friendly and courteous as well as very helpfull. We requested a room on the high floor and we got it. We had a great city view of the financial district and the Transamerica tower. The room service, like any other hotel, was expensive but delicious. The lobby was beautiful. We never got a chance to try the pool or fitness center. The hotel is just 3 blocks away from public transportation pickups. (Bart, Muni, and Cable car) I would definitely reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for a very clean, neat, cozy, and inexpensive hotel. We will definitely be going back."

1,2041,"Oct 8 2009 	Perfect for the price room was quiet and clean and staff was nice.	We usually stay in 4 and 5 star hotels downtown....San Francisco was booked this last weekend and this was our best bet. I was very pleasantly suprised...it was quiet and clean and the staff was super nice....the parking was free and felt very, very safe.....the only drawback was I am sensitive to perfumes and there was a strong 'cleaning product' smell to the room. Other than that it was great for the price....and we might even stay there again!!!"
2,2041,"Sep 23 2009 	I do not care to foster goood feelings between you and Days Inn.	Most Hotels send your confirmation emails or some follow up emails to make sure that the traveler and the hotel are on the same page. I was under the impression that it was just held temporarily and that I would need to call back to get a reservation. I recieved no confirmation information. I got charged 115.49 for a stay that did not happen. I concluded that I did not have a reservation or that it was canceled so i booked a room elsewhere. When I called and asked Andy Suthar about their procedure and how they handle errors and mistakes. WE do not send any follow up emails since that is not our job. I asked for a credit to fix this problem and to help foster good feelings between me the consumer and Days Inn. Andy Suthar said, I don't care.&quot; After reviewing the reviews of this hotel it was a blessing in disguise that we did not stay there and never will. It is too bad that Days Inn will have to suffer just from one rogue operator who geuinely does not care to keep traveling consumers happy. Bye."
3,2041,"Sep 23 2009 	Alcatraz swim	The hotel staff was kind and friendly. The rooms were small but very well kept and clean. The location was great for shopping, nightlife, swimming and beaching. Great experience."
4,2041,"Sep 9 2009 	Great Value for the price!	I stayed at Days Inn for the Labor day weekend and I found it to be of great value. I paid $75.00 a night and for that price you can't get a better deal in town. Check in was a breeze and I received no attitude from the front desk during my entire stay. I don't know what the others were complaining about. There was enough parking and the room was clean. The room was also very quiet. I stayed in room 21 which was a non smoking room on the bottom floor toward the back. Breakfast did not have much to offer - pastries, bananas and hot drinks but why complain at this price point? With the money you save on not having to pay for parking, you can walk across the street and go to IHOP, if you want a heartier breakfast. I agree with all the other visitors who said if you want 5 star service and amenities stay in a 5 star hotel! I will definitely rebook at this hotel the next time I'm in town."
5,2041,"Sep 2 2009 	Great! Very friendly staff good location free parking pet friendly.	After reading all negative reviews I was ready to see horrible place with unfriendly staff. But my experience was completely opposite! I was very surprised to find friendly staff, responsive to our special requests.The place is pet friendly, not easy to find. Free parking is a great, considering street parking is almost impossible to find.The room is small, but clean with plasma TV. Street noise level was not bad at all.Location is great with a lot of great restaurants and businesses. Walking distance to Exploratorium. Short bus ride to Fisherman's Wharf.Bottom line: If you expect to find Ritz Carlton amenities this hotel is not for you. Otherwise its a great inexpensive place to stay."
6,2041,"Aug 13 2009 	TERRIBLE PLACE---STAY AWAY!!!!!	I have never had a worse experience. This place is just awful. Let me quickly list some of the details:1. They overcharged me. And not just a few dollars. They charged me 20X's the amount they should have. And they did it on two separate cards.2. The place is very noisy. Unless you get a room at the very back, be prepared.3. Some of the outlets didn't work in the room. The refrigerator didn't work. It was dimly lit, probably because it was missing a lamp.4. Linens were filthy---smoke burns in some, stains in others.5. The room stunk. They used some spray to mask a foul odor, and that made the odor only worse. 6. Continental breakfast? Ha!!! Just terrible. Don't touch it.There were other things too, but these are most of the more memorable highlights.BEWARE!!!!!! Not sure why Days Inn hasn't terminated the Patel's franchise."
7,2041,"Jun 2 2009 	Greatest experience	I was in town for my high school reunion and booked a room at the Days Inn for 1 night while I was in town. I stayed in room 117, very quiet ! especially for a hotel on a busy street. No traffic sounds, no people going up and down the stairs like in some other places I have stayed. The room was very nice and clean. The man at the counter was so sweet and helpful. I paid only $69.99+tax for the room for a sunday night during the Memorial Day weekend. Loved the flat screen TV, the sky light in the bathroom and the PARKING! which is a big hassle in the city. Definetly a place I would stay again."
8,2041,"Jun 1 2009 	perfect for adventurous young couples (and everyone else!)	The Days Inn on Lombard street is the perfect value hotel for travelers visiting San Francisco. I had a very good experience from a planning perspective; it was easy to find the exact room I needed (we booked a smoking room, something that is difficult to find in the often 100%-smoke-free city) and the price was excellent for us... it was $71.99/night at the end of May, plus free parking! The other hotels we looked at were far more expensive with the added price of mandatory valet parking or no parking at all. So the Days Inn seemed perfect on paper.When we arrived, check-in was easy and stress-free. The room was really nice, especially for the hotel being such a deal on price! We got a king bed. There was plenty of walking space in the room, rather than all the furniture being crammed in like other places we've stayed. The bed was springy and the pillows were soft. The bedspread looked clean and the sheets were clean too. The room was a smoking one but it smelled nice, not musty.We got free Wi-Fi, there was a coffee maker, fridge, and microwave, and a nice flat-screen TV with plenty of channels. The only problems with the room were that the lighting was a little dim (which didn't really bother us) and that the bathroom door didn't close all the way---not a problem for a young couple because privacy isn't really an issue.The hotel is a hearty walking distance from Fisherman's Wharf--I say hearty because you will have to walk up one of the steepest hills in the city! But it was doable. My guy and I walked all the way down to Pier 39, up Columbus Street and back... we are very out of shape so if we can do it so can you! Otherwise, there's lots of great public transportation in the area. Parking seemed to be an issue for a few people. I think there are more rooms than spaces. But we had very good luck and were never wanting for a place to park when we got back from our drives; and it didn't seem to matter what time of day we came back during, there was always at least one spot. We saw two people having to wait, without spots, but the manager seemed eager to solve the problem. It's better if you have a compact car.The street was packed with plenty of eating establishments. There's a liquor store down the way and a Walgreen's. We were only asked for money by two homeless people and they were very polite. It's a safe area. The parking is inside so I knew my car was safe. I would definitely stay again if the prices stay low and I would recommend to family and friends!"
9,2041,"Apr 14 2009 	Hotel just cancelled the booking	Might seem a little strange to write a review for a stay that never happened, but the behavior of the hotel is worth mentioning. I went through and booked a stay via daysinn.com and got a quite good rate. Two days after I just wanted to check some information in my reservation and pulled it up on the daysinn.com website. There it stated: &quot;Your Reservation Has Been Cancelled&quot;. I had gotten no email or notice whatsoever. I called the central reservation line for daysinn.com and they told me that the hotel had cancelled the reservation but the could'n see why so I had to call the hotel, and then the fun began: (In the meantime the rates had gone up...)At first the attendant couldn't find any reservation on the date and name (understandable since it had been cancelled), but he claimed that my booking probably hadn't gone through. I emphasised that I had in front of me a conformation email with a conformation number so it most certainly had gone through. I then quoted the confirmation number, twice, only to get back that &quot;That is not a conformation number, our numbers are different&quot;. I told him to stop making a fool out himself and pull up the reservation, which he finally did. (I really, really hate being lied to...) Then he blamed the computer for giving me an incorrect rate and that no way he could sell me that room for the price in the confirmation email, he could however give me a &quot;special price just for you of $89,99&quot; since my reservation had been cancelled. I said that I wanted him to honor the original agreed upon rate and that I could get cheaper rooms elsewhere. And now for the best part; he started telling me that I couldn't compare his place with the other cheap hotels, he ran a &quot;four star hotel, ocean view, walking distance to almost everything, top-of-the-line&quot; so $89,99 was a fantastic deal. Anybody been here before knows this is complete rubbish....After also being served a lie like &quot;We couldn't send you an cancellation email because we didn't have your email-adress&quot; (Ok, so how could you send me an order confirmation? At least he know admitted that he had cancelled the hotel room...) I basicly just gave up and decided I didn't want to stay there no matter the price."

11,2041,Feb 21 2009 	Rubbish.	pre-booked well in advance and was told on arrival that i hadnt confirmed the booking (which i had) just so he could then charge me more for the room (as it was Fleet week there were very few rooms anywhere). heard the staff do the same to another couple to. avoid at all costs.
12,2041,"Jan 24 2009 	Expectations exceeded	This motel was a very pleasant surprise and brilliant value - much cheaper than we expected to find in this area of San Francisco.The location is great for visiting the Marina, beach and Presidio on foot.The bed was very comfortable, with good quality linen. The temperature of the room was easy to control, the bathroom was adequately equipped and clean, and there was a large, brand new widescreen tv. The check-in clerk was very friendly and helpful; athough the car park was full when we arrived, he made the effort to ensure we got a space. Although located on a very busy street, the rooms were quiet.Just one reservation - the 'continental breakfast' included in the room rate was self-serve from the reception area and offered only a slightly tired danish pastry and a small selection of fruit, although the coffee was good."
13,2041,Dec 30 2008	Terrible experience!!	Having read the recent reviews for this place i cant belive the amount of people that have been lied to by the staff at this Days Inn. After a wonderful experience in another Days inn on our road trip we were delighted to find another that was located pretty close to the Warf. The staff told us we could have the room for three nights and then in the morning said it was no longer available and swore he never said anything about three nights. We had the inconvenience of trying to find an alternative and ended up having to cut our stay in San Fran short as a result. Very rude and abusive staff and the place wasn't great either
14,2041,"Aug 8 2008	This is a place NOT to stay in SF!	Sometimes when you find a place, a little hole in the wall place, a place you can count on time and time again--it's the right price, located in the right place even includes free parking and free Internet, you take for granted that it will always be this place. But nothing is forever... and once it stops being that place, it's hard for it to ever recover. Because once trust is betrayed there is forever doubt...This is a story of such a place that betrayed our trust. And because they made it so miserable for us, challenging us by saying things like, &quot;tell whoever you want, we never want for business!&quot; we would like to remind people that such betrayers of trust are defiantly out there! They think we the people are powerless against them and their poor service, that we don't have choices, that our voices won't be heard nor our warnings heeded!

15,2041,"May 20 2008 	Great Neighborhood	We actually explored the neighborhood a iittle more this visit, and found it to be full of restaurants and markets and movie houses. It was great. And the hotel was fine. It was clean and you could get a free banana and coffee in the morning. I had enough towels, and they gave you shampoo and lotion. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, but the front desk was helpful when I needed them to be. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
16,2041,"Mar 7 2008 	A bit out of the way.	We stayed only one night at this motel and it was quite ok. The room was small, but clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.We chose this motel mainly because we needed a place with a parking space. The location is not ideal and we ended up having to take a taxi when going out at night. In retrospect it would probably have been just as easy to find a hotel with a parking space more centrally located and the next time I am in SF I will choose a hotel closer to union square. Like most motel chains the breakfast was poor, but there is an Ihop just across the street so we ate there instead."
17,2041,"Feb 25 2008	Great Location Good Service Nice Room	All the bad reviews that this place has been given did not deter me from keeping an open mind. My companion and I were comfortable, treated fairly and cordially, I made several requests that were attended to immediately with kindness and overall, it was a very very good stay in a convenient location. Go in with an open mind and gentle heart and you will be treated well, and enjoy your stay at this location. We paid $70 and I didn't bother to check for lower rates but at San Francisco prices I think it was a good value."
18,2041,"Feb 1 2008 	Worst Experience Ever	After having a satisfactory experience with the Day's Inn on our road trip, we had the misfortune of staying one night at this location. The location is definitely not to acceptable standards. It was dirty, old, moldy and in poor repair. The attendant was rude, lied to us and unpleasant in his demeanor. I would not recomend this location to anyone. I have also advised the Day's Inn Head Office people of our experience and I would advise other travellers to do the same."
19,2041,"Nov 25 2007 	The worst experience ever	We booked through Days Inn directly, and for a good rate, pre-paid with a no cancellation policy. The experience was the worst in our 30 years of traveling. We were lied to, the place was filthy, my wife was called a &quot;whore.&quot; We had been regular customers at another Days Inn in the city with generally good treatment, but this particular place is unique --in the world. We complained to the company; it referred us to the motel directly; we got in contact with it; it bumped us back to the company. And so forth. Avoid at all cost."
20,2041,"Nov 9 2007 	Excellent Location	There are a lot of complaints about this hotel in Trip Advisor Reviews and as a result we were very nervous about staying here. We found the reception staff very pleasant and helpful. They had our reservation at the price we expected and when we wanted to book again at the end of our stay in the USA they were very obliging.Whilst the hotel is undoubtedly quite old, with paint peeling off the walls in some areas, the room was clean and more than adequate for our family.The breakfast advertised was disappointing and you should not make your choice based on this inclusion. However, excellent restaurants are located only a very short walk away. There are also small grocery stores around where it is possible to buy breakfast cereals etc.Overall a good choice for the budget minded traveller wanting a hotel in an excellent location. This hotel does not deserve all the bad press."
21,2041,"Oct 23 2007	This motel gives Days Inn a bad name	Pretty much the same horrible experience as other guests. The manager lied about our confirmation. He was rude. And yes, the poor service, we also had to get our rollaway bed. Rooms were dirty. The front desk area smelled. All in all, it was one of the worst lodging experience in my 30 years of travelling. Wish I had read the reviews before booking. Days Inn franchises their hotels/motels to private parties, so there is no quality control. I will also avoid staying at Days Inn."
22,2041,"Sep 24 2007 	Bad smell old torn furniture unfriendly personnel - why stay there?	I have not much to add to the reviews you can read below. I can confirm the bad reviews entirely. It started with a completely ignorant hotel manager.I had a reservation for a king, he gave us a double queen with the remark that the 2nd bed was free. What a [--].If you want to share a bed with your girlfriend a double queen is not the same as a king. Anyways prices for both any of those two arrangements are mostly the same wherever you go. This guy thinks he is funny. The room was equipped with old torn furniture, old mattresses and there was an intense bad smell in this hot steamy room.We decided not to stay there and pay anyways (advance rate, not refund).Worst experience on a 3 week trip through CA, AZ,NV.The Days Inn on Sloat is a lot better. We stayed there 5 nights."
23,2041,Aug 17 2007 	Very bad experience	We reserved two rooms with two beds. The owner told us we only booked room with one bed. It is impossible. I booked with my colleague together. He did not tell the truth! We have to get another bed from storage room ourselves. Room not clean and bad smell.Never book Days Inn anymore!
24,2041,"Aug 17 2007 	Scam - Beware!	At checkin they refused to honor my confirmed reservation (via email), saying they were booked solid. I did not receive notification that it was bad before I got there. After looking the place over and seeing the street noise and quality of the building, I was relieved, even though put out at suddenly not having a room. They sent me down the street to an Econo-Inn that was worse, at a significant upcharge. Days Inn customer support put me on perpetual hold - I never got through."
25,2041,"Jun 19 2007 	Not so bad but...	We chose the Days Inn, Lombard Street for several reasons. Firstly we have stayed at Days Inn in different cities and it always seemed to be the best value for money (Cheap, clean, sometimes pool and full continental breakfast included)Second, the situation on Lombard street seemed quite centraland third, the parking was free.However, the rooms were slightly smaller and shabbier than on earlier occasions. There is no pool. The parking is free but very small and tight. The distance from the hotel to Fisherman's Wharf is actually very far. It can be walked but too far for us. There is no direct bus to the Wharf, so we took two busses.(For the evening, there are a lot of restaurants at the Wharf that, if you eat there, you get 3 hours free parking right at the waterside (eg. Pier 39 parking lot) )The breakfast was here only bearbites (pastries) and tea/coffee, nothing else.The worst thing was the smell of Indian cooking all day long at the reception area. The management (doing the cooking) was not very professional. Tried to help us with a room change but ended up making quite a mix up, even giving us the wrong room key which gave us access to someone else's room where we could have stolen anything we wanted. And on the second morning, we wanted to make an early getaway but the reception and breakfast area didn't open until 8am although it was supposed to open at 7am. A sleepy receptionist (owner?) let us in saying that it was normal because they didn't open until 7:30am!All in all, budget minded people will have an enjoyable stay here, but the mangagement should get a serious shaking up by &quot;Days Inn&quot;"
26,2041,"Feb 16 2007 	They were wonderful!	I booked another motel on line for Christmas week. It was terrible, so I started looking around and found the Days Inn about 2 blocks away. They were so nice! Even arranged for me to check in at 11:00 AM after my one nights stay at the other place. The room was large, clean, and the staff went out of their way to be helpful. When I went next door at ask a question of one of the maids, I found her on her hands and knees vacuuming under the bed. That is going the extra mile! Manger explained the bus routes for me, drew me a map, and even gave me his cell number if I were to get lost. I WILL certainly go back there."
27,2041,"Oct 17 2006 	New owners doing their best to run service into the ground	The person I stayed with here has been staying here for a dozen years at least. It's perfect for coming up from the South Bay and dining around this amazing neighborhood for the weekend.However, the ownership changed three months ago, and after our first night with the new people, we will never go back. They are rude, combative, and let the cleaning staff steal whatever is left behind. I went back for something and was actually told that there was nothing they could do if the cleaning staff had been by. Of course, my item was missing and the owner just shrugged.Our toilet didn't flush, our door didn't lock, and our things were stolen. All of these things were our fault according to the management. They told us to come get a plunger, just shut the door tightly, and tough luck for leaving anything behind.When we said we'd be writing a review on my site, he said go ahead. He didn't care that he'd lose loyal customers because, &quot;We never lack business.&quot;Read the entire review on[--]"
28,2041,"Oct 14 2006 	dirty moldy room free parking great location	The room was gross with alot of street noise, but its cheap and parking was free. Its also within walking distance to fishermen's wharf etc. so if you just need a place to crash its ok. The hallways are outdoors and are cat-walk like, so expect noise when others walk by."
29,2041,"Jan 6 2006	Will never stay at Days Inn	I never actually stayed at this hotel, but I must let others know about my unfortunate experience with this specific hotel for future reference. I made a reservation to stay at this hotel with my travel agency, AAA. I cancelled the reservation four days in advance and was given a cancellation #. While I was in SF on my trip (and staying in another hotel) this Days Inn held money on my account because they claimed that I did not cancel the reservation. This money (almost $80) was later taken out of my account by Days Inn. When I provided them with the cancellation number, they claimed I would have to wait until they could investigate it. I must add that the entire process of dealing with the hotel was awful. I dealt the a manager who was very rude named Jack. He told me this was not his problem, never once apologized for the inconvenience of erroneously taking money from me, and hung up on me. My husband had to call him back and talk to him because he was so rude to me. After numerous phone calls to corporate office, I was told I would have to make a claim. I was also informed that since this specific hotel was privately owned, corporate Days Inn couldn't really do much about it. I was then told I would have to wait 10 days to give them time to investigate it. Waited 10 days and was then informed that my travel agency was the guilty party and that they had made a double reservation, which is highly unlikely because I watched the agent make it. So, instead of just reimbursing me money that I was owed for a false charge made by them, they now want to place the blame on AAA. So now AAA is going to reimburse me the money because its easier than dealing with Days Inn. So this unprofessionally run Days Inn gets to keep my money that they wrongfully took from me and that rude manager never gets to learn from his error. No justice. Hopefully this awful experience is useful for someone someday!"
30,2041,"Jul 12 2005	Good location room very musty	This is one of a number of inexpensive hotels/motels in the Marina District of San Francisco. The room I got had a strong mildew odor, could have been either the carpet or the shower area, I forget which. Otherwise the room was OK, not spectacular. On the other hand, the neighborhood is very lively and safe. Lombard St. in this area is a major arterial street, mostly full of fast traffic, fast food and other cheap hotels. But you can walk two blocks north to Chestnut, or a few blocks south to Union and find yourself in a very nice shopping/restaurant area. Access to public transit (Muni and Golden Gate buses) is also very good."
31,2041,"Nov 24 2003	Would recommend	Stayed here for three nights while exploring San Francisco. While the hotel is not located near any of the major sights (well, the Golden Gate Bridge is a short 10 minute drive away), I enjoyed my stay here. I got an excellent rate of $55.00 a night plus free parking. Since I booked this hotel in advance and knew what the rate was, I was a little worried that it would be a rat trap for being that cheap in San Francisco. As soon as I got into my room (all rooms were outside corriders, which I don't really care for), I checked it over completely to make sure everything was O.K. - no bugs in bed, clean sheets, water was clear, not brown and dirty, and the air conditioning/heat worked. Satisfied that everything was O.K. I unloaded my car and enjoyed staying there the next three nights. I didn't have any problems at all. The area was pretty safe as there were plenty of other hotels and a few restaurants close and the hotel is located off of a major street (Lombard, which is also Highway 101 a major street that cuts through San Francisco). The hotel was pretty far from most attractions, but was along a bus route (though I never used the public transportation in San Francisco so I don't know if it is any good or not). One night after dark I walked back to my hotel from Fisherman's Wharf, thinking that it wasn't that far away, and ended up walking 2 miles! (I drove the same route the next day and clocked it to see exactly how far away it was.) I would definetly stay here again when in San Francisco based on the price and the fact that it wasn't a complete rat trap for that price."
32,2041,"Jul 1 2003	Horrible	Horrible service, the attendants were rude and unprofessional. When we arrived, they payed little attention and gave us a hard time when we asked for help. We've even said good morning without replies except with cold glances. We were extremely disappointed by the manners of staff and the rooms did not have hot water constantly. I would definetely not recommend staying here."
33,2041,Nov 6 2007 	Muy bueno
34,2041,Sep 28 2007 	Nie wieder dieses Motel!
1,2052,"Our Favorite Motel Gem in SF	We've stayed here 3 times over the last 2 years and will be back again when next in SF. The upgraded rooms and furnishings are well above any comparable national chain and kept very clean., It's very fairly priced for the quality received at this motor court motel. Managers Henry and Emma are great."
2,2052,"Nov 23 2009 	Much nicer than expected excellent value!	Excellent value!, paid under $70/night. Room was very clean and MUCH nicer than expected with upscale bedroom furniture and stylish granite bathrooms ... a nice surprise after a long day of travel. Some road noise could be heard, but felt safe overall. Several restaurants and a few party stores were within a block's walk, convenient. &quot;Continental&quot; breakfast was offered in the a.m. which consisted of a basketful of prepackaged cinnamon and pecan rolls (better than nothing) and coffee/OJ/Cranberry juice. Rooms also had small coffee makers."
3,2052,"Oct 18 2009 	Convenient Location Clean and Safe	I rated this one as a very good stay given the great location, low rates, and the other stuff, like free wireless, fridge, microwave, iron etc. Room 215 was clean and quiet with a nice marble shower and comfortable bed. There is an abundance of cafes and stores in the area and you are a short walk from the Presidio and Golden Gate Park. Parking if you need it is in the courtyard right outside your door."
4,2052,"Jun 29 2009 	Wonderful Motel Great service Fantastic Location	We were in the city to see the TUT exhibit ( just a few blocks away at the De Young) and found The Geary Parkway Motel a perfect location, the price is right, free parking, continental breakfast and Henry at the desk is wonderful. The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable and we had no problem with noise. - Visit the Geary Parkway Motel, you will well taken care of."
5,2052,"Apr 26 2009 	Great Room Great Value Great Service	I too was leary about staying at this hotel with my elderly mother and sister. We had read bad reviews on the web but this hotel was reasonably priced and an easy bus ride to the VA hospital. When booking the hotel over the phone the manager was very friendly. Once we arrived the manager was once again very friendly and helpful. Room 106 with 2 double beds was very clean and comfortable. The room was a bit small but still a comfortable stay. Also, very close to many choices of resteraunts and bus 38 was quick and easy to catch."
6,2052,"Mar 25 2009 	Great Accommodations	Room 206 with a King Bed was clean and quiet . The management was very helpful in answering questions. Lots of different Ethnic Restaurants in walking distance. Also less then a 15 minute walk to Golden Gate Park to visit the De Young Museum, California Academy of Science, Japanese Gardens and more. Bus 38 was a quick ride(Less then 30 minutes) to Downtown. Most importantly the price was very reasonable. Enjoy"
7,2052,"Mar 1 2009 	Much better than previous reviews indicate	We picked the Geary Parkway Motel primarily because of its close proximity to the home of friends we were visiting in the Richmond District of San Francisco, and its very reasonable price (for that city), but were kind of dreading our stay due to the negative comments about customer service posted by prior reviewers. We were pleasantly surprised. The attitude of front desk staff, especially Henry, was professional and helpful. The room, although on the small side, was very clean, and had better than basic appointments: microwave, cube refrigerator, fairly comfortable king bed. The free parking was also a &quot;bonus&quot; in San Francisco. We will definitely stay here again when we visit our friends."
8,2052,"Aug 28 2008 	Bad Idea!	I thought I would save a few bucks by staying here. Nope, they are pricey, and not to mention, rude. I will not stay here on my next trip to wonderful San Francisco. Besides this motel, everything in San Francisco was wonderful. If I can help one traveler from staying here, I will feel like I didn't help enough."
9,2052,Jul 15 2008 	Stay Far Away From This Place	I just need a place to stay for a night on my way through to Souther California. I wish I would have driven a little further. The people that work there are the rudest I have encountered in the Hotel business. The non-smoking room smelled like someone just finished smoking a pack. They charged me a higher price than they told me on the phone. Their bedding made me itch. The location is no good either. There is nothing to walk to except the park. Save yourself the misery that I endured so that you won't have to.
10,2052,"May 15 2008 	Best value	We've stayed at this hotel whenever we come to SF. We've been doing it for 2 years. We used to live in the city and feel it's a real gem for it's location and price. It's sometimes noisy but it's obvious since it's on a busy street &amp; next to a bus stop. The best thing is that we've gotten to know the manager &amp; his wife. They have always been accommodating, friendly and professional."
11,2052,"Apr 9 2008	Pleasantly Surprised!	I recently spent 5 nights at this hotel, and after reading the reviews on this website, I had pretty low expectations. If it wasn't for the price and the fact that it's the only location within walking distance from my relatives, I would have skipped it, but I'm glad I didn't. From the moment I checked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality of the staff. I arrived early and the man at the desk went up to have the maids finish my room immediately. It was clean, comfortable, and I never needed anything. Even my relatives commented on how they wanted to stay there instead of their own homes!The staff is also very diligent about keeping up a &quot;positive&quot; image, which I appreciated. For example, my sister had acciendtally taken my room key, and I told her to drop it off at the front desk until I got back, which she did. Later she tried to pick it up again so that she could get some things she had left in my room the night before, and they wouldn't return it to her because a) she was not listed as staying in the room and b) she had her boyfriend with her, and as I was told when I came in a few hours later for the key, they &quot;don't run that kind of hotel.&quot; I know I was happy to hear that they are strict about their policies. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone needing a cheap, clean place to stay. It's not Ritz Carlton, but it definitely does its job well!"
12,2052,"Feb 13 2008	Horrible	I have a three month old and was walking with her in a baby carrier when the belt harness suddenly came loose. I stepped inside the office of the motel to ask the woman if I could put my baby down on her chair while I fixed the carrier. She told me I couldn't and it wasn't her job to help me out. When I said I hope she doesn't do business like this, she swore at me. I couldn't believe it! Even if this place is cheap, it doesn't deserve to be in existence with someone like that working there."
13,2052,"Oct 6 2007 	Be Careful	Made a reservation online last Sunday to stay at the Geary Parkway Motel this weekend. Before making the reservation, I called the motel directly to inquire about room availability since this weekend is Fleet Week - quite a busy time. Was told there was availability, but the price quoted was higher than the online price. Decided to go with the online price (which was discounted because it required paying in advance). Completed the booking within minutes of speaking with the motel reservation agent. Upon returning from work on Tuesday, I had received a message from the motel that they were overbooked. When I spoke to the motel's agent, he explained that they could transfer our reservation to another motel, the Presidio Inn and Suites, about 5 miles away. Initially, I appreciated the effort to help, but when I checked Trip Advisor for reviews, there was nothing above a 1 on the first page of reviews, and a 2 overall. It was also too far away from where we needed to be. I became worried about a &quot;bait and switch&quot; tactic, so I called the agent again and let him know that The Presidio Inn would not work for us. I explained the situation... that I had called the motel before booking to make sure there was availability and that the overbooking situation had apparently occurred after my reservation, and asked if there was anything he could do. He said he would check with the hotel desk person and call me back the following day.... didn't happen, so I called the online booking agency and cancelled through them on Wednesday. The motel rep I had been speaking with finally called me back Friday and said he needed to know if we were keeping our reservation at the Presidio Inn.... 2 days after I had cancelled the reservation with the booking agency. Beware - communication between the online reservation agency and The Geary Parkway is sorely lacking, and &quot;paid in advance&quot; does not guarantee your reservation at this establishment. You may find yourself without accommodations, as we are. I am waiting to see if my bank card account is reimbursed."
14,2052,"Jun 27 2007 	Spotless!!! convenient	This was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in. I kept thinking that the entire bathroom was wet, but it was just SUPER SHINY and polished. Really nice place, cozy and conveniently located right near the bus stop."
15,2052,"Jan 21 2007	Extremely rude staff	I stayed for one night at this hotel and specifically chose it for it's good location. But would never recommend it to anyone because of the extremely rude behaviuor of the motel staff. They do not honor their online coupons at google and are extremely rude denying it.Their toilets are dirly with rusty panelling and moist floors. They also do not provide complementary breakfast they so proudly advertise.Bottomline, they know people would come because of the location and it shows in their extreme arrogance."
16,2052,"Jul 23 2005	A bit noisy but great location	Yes, it's noisy, but close to everything you want to see. Also, for the price (very reasonable), you can't expect peace and quiet. Room was clean. Very close to Golden Gate Park"
17,2052,"Mar 17 2004	Crummy hotel in a decent area	This hotel has great potential since it is in a nice, friendly walking neighborhood that is just a 10 minute bus ride from everything that is great about this city. The rates are decent for this area as well. However, the poor customer service of the staff/owners, noisy parking lot and somewhat questionble character of other guests there (fights in the parking lot in the middle of the night and several really noisy neighbors partying all night) make it a place I would not stay again. The Greenwich Inn in the Marina area is much nicer for about the same price."
1,2053,Aug 11 2009 	GOod once I found it	Has now been renamed the Citigarden - shame nobody toldme! It's in the process of being re-furbished and my room had recently been decorated. A good sized room and only a few minutes from the airport. Asked for wake up call was on time and there was somebody at reception to check out at 5am. Eat in a pizza place in South San Francisco which is worth checking out if you want a change from the chains.	
2,2053,May 19 2009 	Auto hit and run park and fly	I left my new vehicle parked in a handicap parking space that was under their survalance camera. I asked if that was a good place to park for security and ok for park and fly. I was told that was a good spot. When I returned several days later
3,2053,Dec 29 2008	Great hotel for a family on a Budget!	My husband and I with our 3 kids stayed here and found the experience better than expected. It was simple but clean and comfortable. They offer a simple breakfast of cereal and toast with coffee and juice
4,2053,Dec 12 2008 	2star. bad guest relations	Nice rooms
5,2053,Dec 2 2008 	Not bad at all for a night	I stayed in the hotel for a single night after one of my flights was canceled. I thought it was fine; comparable perhaps to a Red Roof Inn. Everything was spartan but clean. I got the room for only $50/night (including taxes and fees) on Hotwire
6,2053,Oct 22 2008	DIRTY HOTEL	I booked this hotel through Expedia and one night is about 62 dollars. Before I thought it's a cheap price to stay in but after I lived there for 4 nights I felt the price I paid for was not worth it. The carpet is really old and dirty
7,2053,Oct 21 2008 	Well you do get what you pay for. Won't be staying here again.	I had a mixed reaction with the front desk personnel. An old woman at the desk was quite abrupt and rude. A male receptionist I spoke with was very nice though. I woke up the last day with bed bug bites
8,2053,Sep 30 2008 	NOT AS BAD AS I EXPECTED	After reading all the reviews of Good Nite Inn
9,2053,Sep 23 2008 	Good value for money	I Stayed at the hotel for 1 night at the end of August 2008.Do not expect too much from the hotel
10,2053,Aug 22 2008 	Do not stay here - They left us at the airport	They left us stranded at the airport for over an hour. Their shuttle does NOT run every 1/2 hour and we called FOUR times asking where it was. Each time a new answer of oh it will be there in 5 minutes. After more than an hour we took a cab. The staff was rude to us when we returned and told us no one had called - a blatant lie and would not reimburse us.This all goes without saying that the room was gross and it's worth 10 more dollars to stay where the people are nice and the room is clean.	
11,2053,Jul 22 2008 	Good for 1 night	I used hotwire $50/night to stay here. Didn't had a choice since Priceline hotels were booked up that Thursday night. I figure I can rough it out for one night after reading the bad reviews.The lobby is beautiful
12,2053,May 20 2008 	Bed - Hard as a rock	Bed as hard as a rock - pillow very lumpy. Bus driver couldn't take me to airport - his bus was reserved for a tour group. I had to have the desk clerk call for another bus for me. The IHOP restaurant listed across the street was about a block away. Not a very pleasant experience.	
13,2053,Apr 20 2008	Cheap room	The hotel was close to the airport
14,2053,Mar 26 2008 	dont stay there	ok seen the samples and dont agree!!!!!!! the hotel is [--]. had problems after booking over the internet and the staff were in no way inclined to try and help to sort the problem out!!!! ended up walking to find a new hotel....	
15,2053,Mar 21 2008 	What do you expect for $60!	This hotel is exaclty what I expected for $60.Pros: Convenient
16,2053,Jan 26 2008 	OK for a few hours	We booked this hotel on Expedia because we only needed a bed for a few hours and the cost was under $50. We landed at SFO at 9:30 PM
17,2053,Jan 19 2008	Gross	We booked this hotel on the last night of a 5 day vacation because it was cheap and very close to SFO for our 6 AM flight. I was in the room about 10 minutes before I started crying. The door opens to the parking lot
18,2053,Jan 9 2008 	Bad customer service	I purchased a room at the Good Nite Inn SFO through Expedia for $60. We had an overnight layover in San Francisco on a Friday night before we were to catch our next flight out Saturday afternoon.We never did make it to this hotel. Our flight from out of the country into San Francisco was delayed
19,2053,Nov 22 2007 	Sleep with the Rats at Goodnite Inn San Francisco	Filthy rooms
20,2053,Oct 2 2007 	Where to begin....	First do not rely on your GPS to get you here. It will get you to the street but then send you the wrong way once you are off the highway. The receptionist did walk me through the directions and got me to the place finally. Then we got our key card and it didn't work. They wanted us to come all the way back up to the lobby to get a replacement. We were staying up stairs and in the back. I was traveling with my mom and daughter so there was no way I was leaving them outside by themselves to watch the luggage while I went up front. We had to call back to finally get someone to come to us. Did I mention it was freezing?!! Also
21,2053,Sep 15 2007 	A GOOD PLACE TO STAY OVER NIGHT	I drove up from San Diego to see a Giants game. I did not want to spend a lot of money just for one night. I did research and gave this place a chance.Room: it was small but clean and it had the basics. One touch from the the past it had the shower massager attachment haha. The TV was adequate. The most important thing was that the room was clean.Grounds: Well kept and landscaped.Lobby: Gives you false impression how nice your room is going to be. It is really nice
22,2053,Sep 15 2007	Real bargain	We had to look for a bargain overnight stay near SFO due to the weekend closure of the Bay Bridge and our early morning flight to Puerto Vallarta. We found this place online and booked the &quot;park and jet&quot; package on September 1 - one night stay and 7 day parking for $99.38 ($60 plus tax for hotel stay only.) A real bargain
23,2053,Sep 6 2007	Not a good night at the Good Nite Inn	Having read the reviews of others
24,2053,Sep 3 2007 	Good Value- clean well-kept	Good place for the price. It was a former Ramada and has at least as good of quality. Very clean and well-kept.	
25,2053,Aug 24 2007 	Place to crash- Stay away from breakfast!	This hotel is just a place to sleep and fly!Pros:Clean roomCheap rateClose to airportCons:Breakfast is disgusting! Not just the food (a loaf of bread
26,2053,Aug 21 2007 	Good Value For The Price	The staff was friendly and cooperative
27,2053,Aug 1 2007 	Eh!!!!	This is a VERY budget hotel but pretty lobby. No baggage help. Front desk is extremely incompitent and try to fill out the rooms on the far side first so make certain to request a room near the lobby. All rooms are same sizzed no matter where you are (or king vs. two queens). Bathrooms are large but amenities are lacking. The floors are filthy and your feet turn BLACK with soot on carpets (needs renovations). If you like walking barefoot in your room
28,2053,Jul 17 2007 	Good Nite Inn is OK	It is good for value. Do not expect much but when considering price it has a good value. You will get what you have paid. Acceptable clean room and comfort(ie aircondition) Good location for SFO and there is also free shuttle Good for fly and drive. Poor breakfast but it is free
29,2053,Jul 6 2007 	In one Word Horrid!	Customer service was lousy. Told callers that checked in guest was not there
30,2053,Jun 28 2007 	Hotel okay customer service miserable	The hotel was adequate. We stayed there because we could park and fly out on our vacation
31,2053,Jun 13 2007 	far from Good Nite Inn	This place is a joke. First
32,2053,Jun 8 2007 	Does what it says on the tin	I had a late flight into SFO and an early flight out the next day and was looking for a cheap hotel close to the airport. Expedia threw up this hotel and it delivered exactly as it promised.It's easy to find from SFO if you're driving but there's a complementary shuttle which picks up every half hour from the airport. The transfer only takes a few minutes. It's quite a large complex and if you get a far room and have a lot of luggage
33,2053,Jun 5 2007 	decent inexpensive location for trips to SF	If you have a car
34,2053,May 5 2007 	Very convenient accomodation!	This room is very handy if you need to be near the airport. The beds are very comfortable
35,2053,Apr 10 2007	Good cheap 	This is the best bargain near the airport. It's a 2 story hotel and the rooms are clean. Even though it's a mile from the airport
36,2053,Mar 2 2007 	Great deal for park and fly	We also booked this hotel through a park and fly website. Overall
37,2053,Nov 7 2006 	Good value for a park 	I booked this hotel through a park &amp; fly site and was very pleased with the experience. The room was &quot;no frills&quot; but clean and comfortable. The breakfast was not fancy but got us throught the morning and the shuttle was prompt
38,2053,Oct 23 2006 	Fine for one night	We stayed here for 1 night (6 October) and paid around $50 for a room with a king size bed. As we were arriving at 11pm from the UK and driving to Yosemite the next morning

1,2058,Awesome and the best!!!	Great hotel. We are going to visit this hotel once again when we come San Francisco.The bed was luxurious but the heater was too slow in heating up the room but it was OK!This is one of the best hotels to stay in San Francisco INDEED!!
2,2058,"Nov 16 2009 	Good Value Accomodation in San Francisco	We stayed 2 nights in a studio suite which included 2 queen beds, a sofa bed and a small kitchen, which was great for preparing simple meal. The building is a little old, but it is nice enough inside and most importantly it was clean. Sure there are some scuff marks here and there but we werent too fussed about that. The front desk staff were friendly and quite helpful. The location is good - about a 10 minute downhill walk to Union Square. The walk back from Union Square is quite steep but nothing a reasonable fit person couldnt handle. You could always take the cable car back if you needed to, as they stop at the end of the block. The included breakfast is very plain (cereal, pastries/muffins &amp; juice/coffee) and is barely edible, but its better than nothing. If you book online at their website you can get an online rebate of $20 - $25 per day which is applied when you check-out. A previous reviewer said that this rebate is already included in the prices on their website, but this is not the case  I did actually get the rate discounted by the amount of the rebate, so it was very good value. I would recommend this for anyone looking for reasonably priced accommodation near downtown San Francisco."
3,2058,"Nov 1 2009 	Grosvenor Suites; Great Value for Money	We stayed at the Grosvenor Suites for 10 nights; 2 adults and 2 kids under 6. Room for our porta cot too. The hotel staff were excellent; we arrived and they asked if we needed to park a vehicle while we got settled (used a shuttle) and they also asked if we needed a cot for the todler. We were on the 15th floor in a suite with two angles of the city scape. The view was awsome; right infront of the Mark Hopkins and diaginal from the Huntington Hotels. The location is excellent; 1 block from 2 cable car lines; Powell and also California. I marked location down by one as the hills are a challange after a long day out. The room was well equiped with full kitchen including large frigde and freezer plus toaster, coffee maker and micromave. Every morning breakfast was included on the ground floor from 6am till 9am; we used it most mornings to get started. The decor is fine; i read reviews were the decor was slammed; it's fine although not a 4/5 star hotel this is a well equiped vacation appartment and very comfortable. There's a Walgreens two blocks on Powell or a smaller store just one block on Powell. It's location is recommended as everyting is central including Union Square and China Town"
4,2058,"Nov 1 2009 	FIRST IMPRESSION NOT GOOD	We stayed here based on tripadvisor reviews. We were slightly disappointed given the reviews at first. The room smelt musty and the walls were knocked around with people moving luggage in and out all the time. But after opening all the windows and going out for the afternoon, it seemed a bit better. The rooms are clean with a kitchenette and laundry on site. Breakfast is included but is basic. Wireless works well. Parking I think was $35 but we didn't have a car in any case. Being in Nob Hill I don't think was the best base to stay for the three nights we were there. Around the Wharf would have been better, but much more expensive. Homeless people are everywhere, but they tended to leave us alone, although the ones around union square can be more troublesome. The homeless problem lets down what is otherwise a beautiful city. For around US$160 per nite this place is pretty good value, but for another $100 a night I might try down near the wharf next time."
5,2058,"Oct 28 2009	Grosvenor Suites on Pine St	Since a member of our party was attending a 4 day conference we needed a place that was a few blocks from the Moscone. Unfavourable reviews of some of the budget accomodation were the reason for looking at suites. They provided a better quality self contained apartment style accomodation for a group of 3 or 4 at a more affordable price, than the reputable Hotel chains.The Grosvenor Suites did not disappoint. We had a suite on the 18th floor.There is no restuarant, but a modest breakfast is included. Each suite has fully equipped kitchen, but patrons will need to purchase their own provisions. Grocery stores are about a 10-15 min walk away. The restroom is tiny, but adequate in the circumstances..The location is close to all the action and walking distance to Chinatown, the Cable Car Musuem and Market st, if one is able to cope with the steep hills.!"
6,2058,"Oct 26 2009 	A great San Francisco stay	I had a great 10 day stay at the Grosvenor Suites in October. The room didn't look quite as nice as the picture (I was really attracted to the bedding in the picture) but I believe they are upgrading all the rooms. However, the bed was really comfortable and the room was clean, and stayed that way. The service was great, the staff very helpful. Very often my room was made up by the time I finished breakfast.I didn't have a bay view, but then I didn't pay bay view prices, and the night view over the city was just magical.I loved the location, the hills looked daunting but were a challenge (therefore fun).  Breakfast was a bonus. The options were mainly too sweet for my tastes. But I could grab a juice a bagel and a coffee and be happy with my start to the day.Internet worked perfectly 99.9% of the time. I would certainly stay there again and I reckon it deserves full marks for price. I had a very comfortable stay."
7,2058,"Oct 20 2009 	Stay Away!!	Stayed at this hotel in July because it offered a suite at a reasonable rate. To say is was gross and dumpy is an understatement. It looked like a metropolitan fishing/hunting camp for men. Do not stay at this motel. The people in the room next door would cook with unusual spices, which was sucked right into our suite. The decor is lousy, the location is lousy (near the highest peak, but no view, only a walking workout), and the smells from the neighbors were lousy. Do yourself a favor and stay in Union Square at one of the clean hotels that has standards. And don't fall for the &quot;on-line cash rebate&quot; offer on their website, because the prices listed on their website already include their &quot;rebate&quot;, so there isn't actually a &quot;rebate&quot; or savings of any kind. Their &quot;business center&quot; had one old and outdated computer. Could not get the internet to work. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone!"
8,2058,"Oct 19 2009	Good and Bad	ProsLocation - 2 minute walk from Union Square, cable car stop just down the blockBreakfast - included in pricePrice - cheap for San Fran (but as I learnt you get what you pay for)kitchen facilities - in case you need themConsLocation - up two very steep hills which makes it a pain to get to (I'm 37 and fit and even I tired)Rooms/Decor - outdated 70's decor. The room was huge but its well worn. The other problem was the windows were single pane so there was tonnes of noise from the traffic early every morning. We could never sleep in as a result. We moved here after a one night stay at the Courtyard Marriott (on 2nd Street) and it was a huge downgrade!Staff - Unattentive, Rude, unhelpful. The staff at front desk changed often and the service faltered as a result. One got the impression that most of them were part-timers just doing this on the side and not thrilled about it either.Smells - this is a hotel that mainly does long-term rentals so people actually do cook in their units and there are some very strong and unpleasant odors as a result. If you're sensitive to smells then be forewarned.Breakfast - they have a lady serving you the pastries and jams from behind a counter. Unless you tip her a few bucks be prepared for surly service. I asked for some extra jam and she refused saying I had enough!!! I complained to the front desk (Antonio) and he actually laughed and basically told me tough luck. I was so flabbergasted I didn't know what to do. So its not a complimentary breakfast .... its a breakfast where they tell you what and how much you can eat. I didn't realise one bagel, one muffin and 3 small packets of jam was considered over-eating! I've never experienced this in over 27 years of travelling! Including to eastern bloc countries! Ridiculous really.The other thing I found particularly unprofessional was the manager and other staff members walking in during breakfast and helping themselves to the food at will.Bottomline:Its cheap but theres a good reason why its cheap (decor, service, street noise). If they could charge more they would ... but for what they offer they cannot. I would not stay here again. If you are well-travelled and discerning (i.e. do not consider a HoJo or Days Inn quality accomodation) you would do well to heed my advice and stay away. However if you are a low budget traveller and your sole goal is to save a few $$ and are not incovenienced by the negatives outlined above then you may well enjoy your stay. To each his own ......"
9,2058,"Oct 9 2009 	Ideally located in San Francisco	Stayed for three nights and extremely satisfied with the accommodation and facilities provided. We had a two bedroomed corner suite on the thirteenth floor and used the hotel garage for the last night. Reception was good, service was good and location was excellent (as long as you are physically able to manage the STEET streets of Nob Hill. Only one block away from the California and Powell St cable cars, and only four blocks from Union Square. Excellent alternative to a hotel, particularly for families."
10,2058,"Oct 5 2009 	An incredible clean comfortable hotel with amazing value and location.	I had crawled all over hotel reviews for San Francisco. I came across pretty good reviews for this hotel and when comparing them to my budget, I decided to take the chance. It was just my husband and I for a little bit of business and a ton of pleasure. We spent the extra $10 a day for the corner suite. TOTALLY worth it. We had 90 degrees of floor to ceiling windows and a tiny balcony. The full kitchen was so nice to have and made leftovers an option from all of the incredible restaurants we dined at. The first thing my husband said was, &quot;Wow. We have a hallway on the inside of our door.&quot; The size was amazing. We had friends paying double what we did for a room at the Grand Hyatt. They had a tiny bathroom and tiny bedroom. We had a tiny kitchen, tiny balcony, small bathroom, small dining area, huge living room, tons of closet space and a decent sized bedroom. Everything was incredibly clean. It was like when I would stay at my grandmas. The furnishings were outdated, but SUPER clean. I'll take that with space to move about over brand new, tiny and overpriced with a fancy lobby.The location was incredible. We were literally a block from the trolley's and walking distance to several options for food, shopping and entertainment. I can not recommend this place enough. We could have easily had 4 adults, more with the roll-a-bed that they charge $10 a day for. If you're staying more than a day, do yourself a favor and book your trip here. You will not be disappointed."
11,2058,Sep 30 2009 	Great location and good value	Stayed for 3 nights at the end of July 2009. I picked this place because of the kitchen and location and wasn't disappointed. Not flash but how much time are you going to spend there? Near trolley stop or easy to walk to shops and restaurants (although the hills may be too much if you are unfit). Grocery shop near by to purchase milk etc. I used the laundry which is also used by cleaning staff to wash to sheets etc. They always made sure a machine was available for me to use. Didn't try the free breakfast but other people seemed to make use of it. In room safe and lots of hanging space. I would stay here again on my next visit.
12,2058,"Sep 29 2009 	Excellent hotel with a superb room	The suite was excellent. The decoration was not very modern but I was surprised with the size of the room, living room and small kitchen. Good view as well and very well located just 10 minutes walk from union square. Definitely next time I'm travelling to SF will stay at this hotel"
13,2058,"Sep 16 2009 	the perfect place to stay	If you're going to San Francisco, make sure (apart from wearing flowers in your hair, as the song goes) to book your stay at the Grosvenor suites. I found this to be an increadibly good deal n this expnsive town.the location is just super: it is in Nob Hill, near Union Square and the cable car Powell- Mason line.The hotel is a 20-story building composed of fully-furnished apartments. Youcan book an apartment for a couple of nights as we did.We got a room on floor 13, which had a balcony and a great view of the city center. It also featured a small bathroom with hairdryer, a bedroom with two queens, a kitchen and sofa room. the room is equipped with wi-fi cpnnection. All was very big and bright, and clean. The good thing is you will have room service, maid service and complimentary breakfast, as if you were in a normal hotel.the recetion was great, we needed checkout at 5 am and they organised a shuttle car for us.I'd definitely return here should I be in SF again and I siuggesyt you do the same."
14,2058,"Sep 8 2009 	great location unbelievable views	Just got home from staying here 9 nights and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Although the place is a little dated. It was very clean and you couldn't beat the views and the location. Walking distance to the Cable cars which bring you down to Wharf area or to Market street where you can catch the street car, bus or subway going anywhere in the city. Staff couldn't have been nicer. Friendly and full of great suggestions on where to go and where not to go. Stayed in a one bedroom suite with my husband and 2 teenagers and there was plenty of room to move around and have some space if you needed. Continental breakfast was perfect to get you started and out the door in the morning. Very happy with Grosvenor Suites and would definately stay there again. Walking distance to union square and to China town. I am so happy with my choice."
15,2058,"Aug 23 2009 	Just a solid great place especially for families	We stayed here for 4 nights, a corner King suite with a pull-out sofa bed for our 9-year old. Here are a few highlights:- We made our reservations online and saved a huge amount of money - it averaged $120 a night, an almost scary rate for San Fran. If it had not been for TripAdvisor, we never would have chosen this place, and would have assumed that based on price it couldn't possibly be safe or tolerable. Thanks to everyone for all the good reviews.- We stayed on the 17th floor - with amazing views, 180 degrees of windows. - The place was frankly a bit worn in areas, not brand-spanking new. But clean, comfortable, well-maintained. - We flew in from the East coast and were grateful to have a kitchenette where we could heat up dinner the night we were too exhausted and jet-lagged to go out.- Front-desk staff were great, even offered to help with our bags when we arrived.- Breakfast was good for us - continental, good assortment, and we brought a tray to our room each morning, and made our own coffee.- No need to A/C! Open a window for about 5 minutes, get the place chilled out, end of story. But we didn;t see a daily high above 66 while we were there.- Cable car got off right in front of the hotel - well, 1/2 block down.We were barely in the room except to sleep. On this particular trip, we also went to Lake Tahoe and stayed at a Hyatt about 3 - 4 x the cost of this place, and it was nice, but hardly worth 3-4x more.- I didn't hear a peep out of another guest during our stay - it was like we were in the hotel alone and I KNOW that wasn't the case.I can;t think of a reason you wouldn't want to stay here - maybe if you prefer things a bit more new/modern/polished.... but honestly, this was lost of us as we looked out the 17th floor at spectacular views. I expected to be disappointed, and no way. Great value."
16,2058,"Aug 20 2009 	Outstanding Value! Would Stay Again . . .	It is hard to add to all the other POSITIVE reviews. We are a group of 4 women that came to SF to see Wicked. We had a one bedroom corner suite , yes, the bathroom is small, but the rest of the &quot;apartment&quot; more than made up for it! there was a FULL size refrigerator, there were FOUR huge closets, the view from our 13th floor was just as good as the Mark Hopkins across the street! The cable car was a half block away on Powell. The continental breakfast was enough to get us started (bagels, donuts, cold cereal, coffee, juice, hey, what do you want for free!!) a tv in the bedroom and one in the front room. Staff was friendly at the desk, in the halls, in the garage. I can not say enough good about this place. BUT don't expect the luxury decorator touches like the $300+ hotels in town, but DO be prepared for big, quiet, clean rooms with views. Look at the pictures others have posted, they say it all. Don't read the OLD reviews. And go see Wicked with your girlfriends! ENJOY, we did."
17,2058,"Aug 12 2009 	Good value	We stayed for a couple of nights in July/09. We were in 6 adults and I had a reservation in a different hotel where we booked 2 rooms. Looking at trip advisor I saw that this hotel offers a room that would accommodate all of us so I cancelled my first reservation. My niece and nephew slept on the sofa in the living room that opens up and was big enough for them. We save a lot of $ staying in the Grovesnor Suites. The furniture is old but we had a lot of space, stayed together all in one room and have a good place to rest after going up and down all the hills in San Francisco. I booked our reservation by the hotel website and got a credit at the end of our stayed (U$ 25.00/per night). They offer a continental breakfast (the place is small but you can take your breakfast to your room, basic but free...) and the front desk helped us with the info we needed. If you are in a big group and want to save some $ it's a good place to stay..."
18,2058,"Aug 6 2009 	Great place to stay great location!	Our family stayed at the Grosvenor Suites for 4 nights. We had a huge room on the 19th floor with a view of the city. We had two queen beds and a sofa that made into a bed. The beds were very comfortable, although I thought they could have had better pillows. There was a large TV, a large table with two chairs, and the lighting in the room was good. The bathroom was small, but adequate. There was a closet and there were drawers to store our clothes in so that we did not have to live out of our suitcases the entire trip. We also had a kitchen, and it was nice to have the refrigerator to keep our wine and soft drinks cold. We never cooked there, although there were pots and pans, a toaster, coffeemaker, utensils, etc. The staff at the front desk were always polite and extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the area. Checkout was at 12 Noon. Our flight was at 10:00 p.m., and we were delighted when the staff offered to store our luggage for the day while we continued to see the sights of San Francisco. They have a computer in the lobby for public use, and we were always able to use it when we wanted. They also have wireless internet in the rooms. Free continental breakfast consisted of several juice choices, coffee, milk, assorted cereals, assorted bagels, danish, donuts, and apples. I would highly recommend this hotel--I thought the price was very reasonable and the location was perfect. They charge $30 to park your car for the day, but we found a free spot on the street very nearby."
19,2058,"Jul 17 2009 	First time TripAdvisor has been wrong	Usually the reviews on here are accurate, but not this time. They first put us in a smoking room, then claimed it wasn't. When they moved our room the keys didn't work, and they went upstairs to show us we were wrong. Then claimed that the machine was malfunctioning. The bathroom had hair on the shower walls. The dishes in the room had food stuck to them. If we didn't get in late with two small children we would have left. I would never return. Stick to something close to Fisherman's Wharf and pay the difference!"
20,2058,"Jul 9 2009 	Excellent room price service and location in downtown San Fracisco	You can't find a better deal in any metropolitan city than the Grosvenor Suites in San Francisco. Our family of six, with twin 2-year-olds, had a wonderful four-day stay here at a rate of $87 a night after the hotel's online rebate, which was figured into our bill. When you go here, regardless of the number in your party, request one of the hotel's corner room suites, luxurious apartment-like, one-bedroom spaces with two queen beds and a hide-a-bed in the living room. The view is tremendous on two sides of your suite, and one side has a sliding door balcony (careful with little ones, we never opened ours til after kids were in bed). The staff here was amazingly friendly and helpful every step of the way and even arranged a $15 per person airport shuttle. Hotel is two blocks up from Chinatown and you can see Macy's on Union Square from upper level balconies on the East side. Hotel is at Mason and Pine. The continental breakfast was a bit lacking, but we didn't really care. Parking is kind of expensive, however, at $30 a night, perhaps why they can afford the low room rates, but we turned in our rental car and went mass transit all week.We will definitely return to this place."
21,2058,"Jul 6 2009 	Great value and comfortable accomodations in downtown San Francisco!	I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel. The front desk staff was always cheerful and friendly, very helpful. Stayed in a two room suite, had two separate bathrooms, a kitchen, and a living room with a flat screen TV. Each bedroom also had a separate TV. Room had no air conditioning, but I quickly found that in this city you do not need one, just open the window at night until the room is cool enough for your taste. Hotel was clean, included onsite coin-op laundry, had an excellent continental breakfast, and was very convenient to public transportation, the cable car stopped at the far corner of the block. I would definitely stay here again."
22,2058,"Jun 30 2009 	great room but beware of service	We stayed in a King corner suite and the room was great. SF was hot buteven with no AC there was plenty of breeze through open windows. I loved the hotel but won't vouch for the HONESTY of the staff. My son left his treasured Alcatraz tin cup in the dish drainer. We were gone no more than 10 minutes and I called the desk to ask to have it mailed. It was 6 am so I am sure the room had not been cleaned yet. The desk said to leave the info with housekeeping. When it was never mailed to us, I called again and spoke with John. He GUARANTEED me he would mail a cup and get back to me within a week... Well, John, I am still waiting for your call.... you broke a little boys heart. jan"
23,2058,"Jun 24 2009 	Great value	Four of us stayed here for 3 nights on our trip to San Francisco. We had a corner suite, which was no extra cost. The room was HUGE. There was a bedroom with two queen beds, a living room with a pullout sofa with a queen-sized bed, a little kitchen area with a table and 4 chairs, plus an awesome balcony. Breakfast was available every morning, which had a decent selection, nothing fancy. The hotel was older, but well-maintained. The service was phenomenal and everyone was very helpful. It wasn't the best neighborhood if you're a tourist, but we were right by a cable car line, so we just got 3-day public transportation passes and hopped on and off freely. There was a computer in the lobby and we were able to print out some of our trip info. The kitchen cabinets even had 4 wine glasses so we were able to sit on the balcony and enjoy our Sonoma wines. (Be sure to bring your own wine tool.) This hotel is a steal--it was pretty cheap for San Francisco, and it was a great experience."
24,2058,"Jun 18 2009 	Inexpensive and plain; beware no air conditioning	Stayed there two nights in late April. It was unusually hot in SF and the room had no AC and the windows only opened a tiny bit, so it was very hot. The suite was big, but felt old and bit worn. Not particularly comfortable. Location on Nob Hill was great, though that hill is steep. For about $190/night including parking, you can't complain too much, but not a great place to stay."
25,2058,"Jun 18 2009 	It's just like your home!!!	Grosvenor Suites is a great place to stay - for days, weeks and months, if you so desire. The corner suite offers awesome views of the Nob Hill and surrounding areas. The bed and bathrooms are not only good but pack enough closet space that I can move in here permanently without disturbing the ambience of the room. The small but effective kitchen, complete with a big refrigerator and cutlery makes you feel at home. The living room is spacious as well as functional. The big TV and working desk can be stations for people enjoying entertainment &amp; work simultaneously and without disturbing one another. Free wireless internet, breakfast and parking facility add to the overall experience. It's also very close to all the action in this city. Be it eateries, shopping, sightseeing or just the tram rides - everything seems to be a stone throw away. Only thing that you'd need to be wary of is climbing the hill, but then what's the fun of being in SFO if you haven't walked through the picturesque houses and streets."
26,2058,"Jun 14 2009 	Really convenient location...	I stayed in a corner suite at the grosvenor in april and really thought it was a great stay considering the good price. It's really all about the location. 2 blocks to union square shopping and right on the cable car line. As far as rooms go it was actually pretty decent...good little kitchenette with full sized fridge, dining table and living room area with seperate bedroom. Bathroom was tiny but well laid out. It was also freeeezing out and the room was always nice,warm and toasty. Good tv reception. We also had a nice big balcony but I would def think twice about letting kids out there..we were pretty high up (level 14) and it didn't feel all that well enclosed. Also probably got hit about 10 times by the curtain pulling rod thingy on the way back in...The beds were super comfy too.Location wise it just can't be beat. grocery store for basics on the corner of powell and we ate at uncle vito's pizza a couple of times which was really awesome pizza and only a block away...you can get delivery to the hotel too.Breakfast was provided downstairs free of charge...pretty standard but hey,it's free.The cable car's to fishermans wharf tend to be packed especially on weekends so sometimes it's worth walking down to get on at the union square turnaround just to make sure you get on.Saw alot of people trying to get on to no avail.My only one word of warning would be it's called Nob Hill for a reason. If hills are tricky for you look elsewhere cause it is a pretty decent almost vertical at some points hike back from Union Square...tonga room at the fairmont is only a block away too (a very steep one block!)...def don't think twice about booking the grosvenor. It's a really good bet. We had great, polite service from the desk clerks everytime with one guy in particular who was an absolute sweetheart. Free wifi too!"
27,2058,"Jun 7 2009 	Comfortable stay great service very happy.	I stayed here for 3 nights with hubby and 3 kids, from April 29. We found the Grosvenor to be in a good location and it was easy to walk down into Union Square. The rooms are dated but were very clean and comfortable with 2 queens beds and a fold out queen bed so there was plenty of room. The room had 2 large storage cupboards and a kitchenette which was handy. The staff were friendly and helpful and there was a complimentary continental breakfast each morning. I would recommend this hotel to others and I would stay here again. Very family friendly."
28,2058,"May 22 2009 	A great place for families to stay in SF	We (me, my hubby, and 5yo) stayed at the Grosvernor Suites for 9 days (7 of the days we were there with my parents). We all stayed in a corner, one bedroom suite (separate room with 2 queen beds and living room with a sleeper couch). You can tell that the building is older, so there is wear and tear (e.g., a small rip in the couch cushion and trim along bedroom floor coming off the wall). However, the structure itself is very sturdy. I believe that the place was originally a condo (there are currently some residents who still reside there), so the walls are thick and we never heard our neighbors (although I could hear from the hallway that they had a young and loud child). Given the bedroom, the dining area and the living room, we had plenty of space for the 5 of us. The rooms also have a small kitchen with full size refrigerator, small stove, sink, toaster, and other necessary kitchenware. We were in a corner suite in the 13th floor and our views were fabulous (we had windows on both sides). It was great to see the fog rolling in and out of the city. Overall, the service was pretty good. Front desk staff was extremely polite and helpful, on the phone and in person. They were very helpful regarding sites and places to visit, making sure we had extra towels/pillows, and allowed us to check out late (2pm rather than noon). They were very accommodating: I had a phone meeting at a time when everyone else in my party was napping so they opened the breakfast room for me to use. Housekeeping staff was o.k.; I definitely didn't get the same friendly vibe and they were not as responsive.The location was great. Very safe (Nob Hill is considered one of the high ends of town). One block from both the Powell and California cable lines, about 3 blocks from Chinatown, and two blocks from the Grace Cathedral and a great little park. The park has a playground and is the place where local Nob Hill residents take their dogs to play. We took our 5yo to this park a lot to burn off energy and watch the antics of the dogs playing with each other. As other reviewers have noted, it is on Nob 'Hill', so you get a great view, but even if you take the trolley, you will have at least one block of an uphill hike. Given how much we ate during the vacation, this wasn't a bad thing for us. Speaking of places to eat, other than Chinatown, we didn't find too many places really close by (although you can easy access them by cable car). The exception is the Nob Hill Cafe which is about 3-4 blocks and has great Italian food. The hotel offers a continental breakfast, with juices, cereals, bagels, and fresh pastries every morning. The pastry person will load up your tray with goodies for you to take back to you room if you don't want to sit in the breakfast room. There is also a laundry room in the basement with 5-6 washers and dryers. There is a gated parking area behind the hotel isolated from the street. It wasn't cheap to park, but you can enter and leave as much as you want. In addition to a computer terminal in the very small info room by the front desk, there is free wireless in the rooms. Compared to other places that we have stayed at in SF and given all the amenities, we got a pretty good deal. I did make reservations way in advance and I did it directly from their website (they offered an online rebate for multiple nights so we saved $20-25/per night). For reservations not made in advance, I heard a front desk person telling another potential customer to check the online travel websites for just-in-time deals that would be better than booking with the hotel directly. What I liked most about the hotel is how attentive they were to our needs as a family (given the location, kitchen/refrigerator, breakfast, and laundry). It was a very comfortable and convenient place to stay. The thing that they could improve on is fixing up and updating the interior a bit, but for us, this wasn't a big deal at all."
29,2058,"May 11 2009	Couldn't have asked for more	This hotel is seriously awesome. Their slogan is &quot;Every room has a view,&quot; and although I can't speak for every room, ours certainly did. We stayed on the 8th floor and it gave us gorgeous shots of the city. Nob Hill is such a cool neighborhood too, right in the middle of everything. The cable cars run one block from the hotel and they take you either directly into Fisherman's Wharf or the other way into Union Square, the Tenderloin/Civic Center, and Market St. Chinatown, North Beach, and the Financial District are all within walking distance. If you want a further trek, Russian Hill is about 15-20 blocks north. It's a nice walk though (I did it many times). And many cabs circulate this area, so it's easy to flag one down and be driven to other parts of the city. If location is your main thing, like mine was, this hotel is perfect. Nob Hill is just amazing. It's also a clean and kept up place. Our room had two queen size beds, a sofa bed, a kitchenette (fully stocked), 2 walk in closets, and a bathroom with a shower, plus an incredible view I mentioned earlier. I really can't see how anyone could be disappointed with a place like this. Absolutely wonderful. I'll be staying here again for sure."
30,2058,"May 5 2009 	A great Nob Hill experience	I spent three days here and was concerned about my decision based on some of the reviews here. I had a studio suite with a balcony on the twelfth floor. The queen bed was very comfortable, the TV had Comcast cable and the kitchenette had all the utensils I needed. The morning continental breakfast has a staff-member on duty to assist. The location is on the same hill as the Mark Hopkins. The Powell St. cable car line is a block away and is the best way to get up/down the hill after check-in (don't try to take luggage on the cable cars - I used Super Shuttle for airport trips). Buy a Muni pass at the booth at the cable car turntable at the bottom of Powell St. or at the airport info centers. These passes include unlimited bus, subway and cable car rides for 1,3,or 7 days for less than twenty dollars."
31,2058,"Apr 27 2009 	Good value/location	Pleased with the size of rooms. We had a corner suite with 2 queens in bedroom and a double sofa bed in lounge (uncomfortable for an adult). TV in each room and kitchenette. Staff helpful, washing machines in basement useful, quiet. Easy walk downhill to Union Square/muni/buses etc and near small playground opposite cathedral. Near cable cars or a few dollars in taxi to some other sites. Negative is a basic breakfast and a bit dowdy in decor but perhaps that keeps price down! Suited us - 2 adults 2 young children."
32,2058,"Apr 23 2009 	Not for business travellers	First the good things: the hotel ist best located near downtown SF, has a good neighborhood and some rooms have spectacular views. You can get an affordable parking lot, the appartments are big enough and have a full kitchen (!). Staff is friendly.But don't use the Grosvenor, if you want a warm room in winter or cool room in summer. The heating is a joke and air condition doesn't exist. Windows are absolutely leak and it's windy and noisy in the room. The offered wifi mostly does not work or has the worst performance I've ever seen in american hotels, so this house is not usable for business travellers. TV-Quality is poor but has a lot of channels. If there is something broken or defective it will never fixed. I was here for 3 times in 3 years, always in the same room and found the same defects. Nobody comes if you complain. They have old ethernet adapters in the rooms but they don't work and nobody of the staff knows anything about it. Local calls are free, says an info sheet, but another sheet demands 0,75 $... There are lots of details, which could work much better, with competent, not only friendly staff."
33,2058,"Apr 14 2009 	Good value but not near the main tourist attractions. On a big hill!	The hotel was clean and comfortable. Decor a bit dated but our room had a full kitchenette with cooking utensils which was a surprise. Continental breakfast was adequate--bagels, pastries, cereal, beverages--which saved time and money. The staff was helpful. The biggest issue for us was the location. We did not have a car. The cable car line was nearby which was what swayed our decision to rent here, but to get to the tourist attractions by the warf (Alcatraz, Pier 39, double decker bus tour, bike rentals, etc) we had to take the cable cars every day. This was fine going TO the wharf, but coming home meant we had to wait in long lines for the cable car. We chose Nob Hill to be centrally located, but most of our transportation ended up being on the streetcars and busses which run along the Embarcadero so we had the daily trek to the wharf by cable car to catch them. Grosvenor is on Nob Hill, and it is a BIG HILL! If you have baby strollers or moblility issues, this is not the place for you. After a long day of touring, it was not pleasant to have to wait 30 minutes for a cable car then hike uphill a couple blocks from the cable car to the hotel. I thought the wharf would be noisy so we didn't pick a hotel there, but mostly everything closes at 10 pm, so it would probably have been ok to stay there. They do have parking for $35 per night at Grosvenor, so if you are using a car, this would be a different experience. Have fun in SF!"
34,2058,"Apr 3 2009 	Amazing value and comfort	I picked Grosvenor Suites based on Tripadvisor.com reviews and its very, very low price (with extra discounts if you book online). With a teen, we wanted a suite with some privacy. We had a huge living room/kitchen where the teen was very comfortable, a very nice bedroom, and it was a corner suite with views north and east - spectacular. It was clean, comfortable, friendly, quiet, fantastic location, and the simple complimentary continental breakfast was just right. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants great value in a moderate, solid, comfortable accommodation."
35,2058,"Mar 30 2009	Perhaps I hoped for too much?	I've only been here for one night [of a 12 night stay] and have had to settle into what this room actually is as opposed to what I thought it would be.I am here with a friend who has to work during this trip and I wouldn't call the Free Wireless &quot;High Speed&quot;. We've both had to restart the connection several times over just to use it at certain points. Again, I've not been here for even 24 hours yet.I am staying in a one bedroom with a queen size bed and a queen size pullout couch. Both are like sleeping on a sack of rocks. My friend is sleeping on the couch in its standard form because if the springs don't get you then the sinking into false points of the frame will. The bed in the bedroom has no sort of give unless you're sinking into springs. I think my friend has the best sleeping arrangement at this point.I was advertised a TV in every room, though there is only one in the living room area. This is fine, but I just thought otherwise. The suite, itself, is spacious, accommodating (for someone with my needs) and very clean. The staff is delightful and helpful.It has a great, centralized location that makes walking a great option for seeing the city and getting things done. If you're not planning on spending a great deal of time in your room then this place is great and really good cost for the area."
36,2058,"Mar 25 2009 	A Great Deal	Stayed 5 nites 2 Adults and 3 teenagers corner suite load of space for 5 with 2 TVS Great location on cable car line best deal 3 day travel pass$22 covers bart all buses and cable cars for unlimited rides try the F Trolley train to Fishermans Wharf and get No 28 Bus from Whraf to Golden Gate Bridge and walk across.

Uncle Vitos Pizza the best Italian food Iv ever tasted also Lefty O Dowds for carvery lunch $10 A good hotel ,great location, super views over San Fran from 17 Floor at $100 per nite for a family You can!t go wrong"
37,2058,"Mar 24 2009 	Clean centrally located and great family value!	My spouse and I, and our 2 kids, ages 1 and 4, stayed in a 1 bedroom suite at Grosvenor Suites March 11-13, 2009. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. A crib was provided for our little guy. The 18th floor suite (of 19 floors) was spacious, and had wonderful views of the city skyline. The king bed was comfortable. The pullout sofa in the living room was ok, given that it is a sofabed. The suite was quiet too.Free continental breakfast was basic; juice, pastries, apples, coffee.Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with info about cable cars. When we paused out front of the hotel to determine if we had the right place and to figure out where to park, the hotel asst. manager came out and gave us a parking pass, so that we could park at the hotel prior to checkin...excellent!The suite was clean, though the carpet appears to be somewhat dated. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking. There is access to laundry in the hotel, though we didn't use it. There is also a vending machine for snacks and a small grocery store nearby.The hotel is centrally located. It is only 1 block to either the powell st cable car line or the california st cable car line. It is also only a couple of blocks walk from China town for great shopping!Overall we had a really good experience at this hotel, and we would definitely return in the future. Be sure to take advantage of the rebate program...the value can't be beat in the Nob Hill area of San Fran!"
38,2058,"Mar 22 2009 	Good place to stay	roomy, confortable, quiet, not far to main shopping area and a good walk to fishermans wharf without the expense of a closer hotel. The rooms have a ktichenette with Microwave, fridge, oven/stove, coffeemaker and toaster. continental breakfast included in the price. onsite parking for a fee which i got discounted when booking through the hotel. it was cheaper to make reservation directly rather than through a website such as rates-to-go. we walked most places from here but beware the hills around town. the cable car is 1 block away. we would stay again if visiting San Francisco"
39,2058,"Mar 15 2009 	Value for money with handy amenities	We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment over Christmas 2008. The apartment was absolutely huge! We had much more space than we could have possibly needed, but that was a good thing. We were on the 5th floor which didn't have much by way of views but aparently the 19th floor has fantastic sweeping views of the city. LOCATIONThe hotel is located on Pine Street atop Nob Hill. It is about 2 blocks downhill to union square. Getting back up the hill is a bit of an effort. We are quite young and fit and occasionally we would be puffed getting up the hill. So if you are unfit or handicapped, the location may not be the best for you. We walked to fisherman's wharf one day which took us about 40 mins at a brisk pace. We also walked to Coit Tower - that took about 40 minutes also. ROOMSAs I said above, we stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment. It had plenty of closet space to hand clothes and store other items. The bedroom was a separate room which was quite large. The bed was king size, however the matress was not firm at all and was quite uncomfortable. The linen was clean, but worn. The sheets were very thin as was the blanket. The quilt also was very worn. I must emphasise however that all linen was clean. There is also a TV in the bedroom. There is a large living room with TV, TV cabinet, 3 seat sofa which folded out to a sofa bed, an arm chair, coffee table, phone table/desk, round glass table with four chairs, an additional 2 decorative chairs.The kitchenette was useful. Only issue we had was with the oven which did not get very hot. After two hours of it being on, it was still not hot enough to cook our christmas roast. To give an example, I had boiled potatoes and then put them in the oven to roast - after 2 hours in the oven they still had not roasted. We ended up having an awful christmas lunch because of that oven! The microwave did a better job of the roast veggies. Also, there were no oven trays - so the oven was practically useless! We had to buy disposable foil oven trays so that we could use the oven. The bathroom is very clean and has everything you need. Toiletries were filled up every day by housekeeping. The bathroom also has a large storage cupboard. It is a little bit pokey and small, but other than that, nothing wrong with it. HEATING/COOLINGThe room tended to get quite cold and there was no heater. There was an internal themostat thingo, but you couldnt turn it up. It got quite cold in the room. There was no airconditioner too, so this may also be a problem in summer. OTHERThe room had an electronic safe which was very useful. Breakfast is complementary and is served daily in a room on the first floor. There is a coffee machine, juice dispenser (orange and guava were served), cereal, pastries and bagels. There were three sets of tables and chairs in the room, however you were able to take a tray up to your room if you didn't want to eat it in the room. There is a computer and printer just off from the reception. This was quite reliable and quick. There are several washing machines and dryers on the ground floor. These are coin operated. We used these twice and found them very new and reliable. There is also a vending machine on this level. Overall, the hotel is very good value for money and one of the only hotels in the city with kitchen facilities. This is the primary reason we picked the hotel since we were staying over christmas. If i went back to san fran i would probably stay closer to union square, but i would consider staying at Grosvenor Suites again. Great value for money and ideal if you have a family since you are able to keep costs down by cooking your own food. There is a small deli on the corner of the block to get groceries from, but it doesnt have a big range. We went to a safeway near Japan town, but we had to catch a taxi back (about 5 minute drive) to the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel if you are handicapped or cannot walk very far. If you are young and spritely, Grosvenor is a great value choice."
40,2058,"Mar 2 2009 	Big room and big view	This is my 3rd stay at this property - and I'm still amazed that it is still such a good value. I booked through their website and with their rebate program, the total cost per night is less than $80, can't beat a deal like that - especially in SF.Pros:1. The rooms are big. The studio that I booked is probably about 500 sqft. It's very hard to find a room that big on a Nob Hill hotel for under $100 a night.2. Location - 1 block from both Powell and California cable car lines3. Full kitchen - great for saving money, get some real Chinese take out from any place off Stockton and you get yourself a tasty feast.4. Great view - I stayed at Mandarin before at their bridge-to-bridge room and it has possibly the best view in the city, but Grosvenor comes close, especially if you're on the higher floor. I stayed at the top floor on a room facing North. The view is Financial District skyline, SF bay and Coit Tower.Cons:1. A bit old - the interior is probably an 80's vintage, so if you're looking for a luxurious room design - don't come here. 2. No safety net on balcony - it's great that some rooms have real balcony but it's a hazard for small kids"
41,2058,Feb 8 2009 	So good!	The room is huge and confortable! The breakfast is very simple.Parking is expensive but the location is ok.
42,2058,"Feb 1 2009 	Good Value	We found this hotel with good reviews, and booked it through Travelocity. We had a late arrival, and I called ahead to let the hotel know when to expect us. The staff was courteous and we had no problem checking in around mid-night. The room was as we expected, clean with a decent view, and there are plenty of closet space. The kitchenette was really nice for heating up those leftover. We stayed for 5 nights, and it was great! I would recommend this hotel because it's clean and didn't cost us a fortune. It is close to the Union Square and Chinatown area, but it's on a hill. If you are not use to walking around or walking hills, you may want to reconsider."
43,2058,"Jan 27 2009 	Great Value San Francisco Hotel	Stayed at the Grosvenor over last Christmas. This hotel is great if you have a little one as you have the luxury of two separate rooms. The pricing of this hotel is excellent, especially by San Fran standards, you will not find better value. I read some of the poorer reviews of this hotel on the site, and I think that the reviewers standards are a little high for the price you are paying and the amount of space you are getting. Sure the place is dated, but the rooms were clean, bed extremely comfortable, excellent location/neighbourhood, and the views amazing. There was some very interesting grout work in the bathroom, but as I said you are not paying for 5 star here. I recommend this place to anyone, especially those with family. Booking through the hotels website gives you a further discount!"
44,2058,"Jan 23 2009 	Something good and something bad	Picked up a bargain with Expedia and considering the excellent location this was a good choice, but we had some problems related to our room. The WC was broken and we had to call the staff 5 times in 3 days. They weren't able to repair the damage, and this thing makes me think that there's a deep problem due to the age of the structure and that they need to call Joe the Plumber to repair the entire tube-system.The room in general was suffering from age, with a teared down look and a general impression of chaos: a door impossible to open due to a table in front of it, ac plugs covered by furniture, and so on...Aside from this, there's a private parking, but it's very expensive (22$ a day, pretty standard for SF I think). We payed 44 insted of 66 as a partial refund for the problems mentioned above. Good if you can get a bargain like me, but probably not so good if you pay the full price.And now the goods:the location in absolutely amazing, and if you are lucky enough you can have a great view of SF from your room's window. Just two blocks from Union Square and well served by public transportation.There's a free internet connection near the hall, and the staff is always helpful."
45,2058,"Jan 11 2009	Huge suite great location and views	This was excellent value. We were on the 19th floor, with spectacular views, and a huge suite with a separate bedroom.The kids slept on the sofa bed, and there were 2 double beds in the main bedroom.Clean, accessable, fabulous location 6 blocks from Union Square, excellent restaurants nearby. Very safe neighbourhood, and centrala great place to stay"
46,2058,"Jan 9 2009 	Excellent Value in San Francisco	Yes its true, the Grosvenor does need a facelift however the dated decor and building does add a certain unique charm to the place.Located on Nob Hill, the veiw from our room of the city skyline was sensational. The beds were comfortable, the suite was clean and a continental breakfast is included. The suites are serviced daily.The location cannot be beat, cable car just a short 2 minte walk if that, in one direction Union Square, in the other Fishermans Wharf. Chinatown was within walking distance.It was nice as a family of 4 to spread our wings after a week in hotel rooms. The suites are well laid out.BARGAIN BARGAIN BARGAIN.....but lets keep this one a little secret so there's availability next stay :o)"
47,2058,"Jan 8 2009 	Nice hotel - Attitude problem at front desk	I totally agree with the previous poster.Not much to add, we must have checked in with the same person at the front desk at night because the experience was the same. We had asked for a room as high as possible months earlier and what we received was one on the fourth floor, which disappointed our kids quite a lot. When I commented about this to the lady ay the front desk the reply was like listening to a tape recording: &quot;We try to listen to our customers requests but sometimes this is not possible, you can try to change after New Year&quot;. That's it.The room in itself was very nice, nothing to complain. A few more shelves for storage of clothes would have been nice though.Can't say we enjoyed the breakfast very much as it mostly consisted of pastries. We didn't see any bread or cereals.Taking these issues into consideration I could still consider staying here again. After all the price was very decent and hopefully the other issues would be better at another time."
48,2058,"Jan 6 2009	Good location great value but poor welcome!	We stayed at the Grosvenor between Christmas and New Year in a one bedroom suite on the nineteenth floor with two queen beds in the bedroom and a sofa bed in the living room. We were travelling from New York and rang ahead to let the Hotel know that we wouldn't be ariving until around 10pm. Our welcome on arrival was bereft of any warmth to say the least. An extremely surly front desk employee signed us in and her manner was such that we were made to feel more like an impositon than guests. As there seemed to be no porters to help with our luggage and in the absence of any suggestions from Miss Surly we comandered a dormant porters trolley to get our luggage to our room after having already carried it. up stairs from the street to reception. Fortunately other staff we encountered during our stay were more helpful. The room and facilities were dated but adequate for our family's needs. The single bathroom was tiny but functional, there was a television in the living room and small kitchenette with full size fridge, oven/hotplates and microwave. The room provided some nice views over the bay and would benefit from having a second tv in the bedroom. A complimentary continental breakfast is available each morning and provides a good selection of cereals, breads, pastries, coffee and teas.The hotel is located at the corner of Pine and Mason Streets just below the top of Nob Hill. This is an excellent location for getting down to Union Square and Market Street and there is a cable car stop less than a block away at the corner of Pine and Powell Streets. You can also catch the cable car from here to the Fisherman's Wharf area. There are also plenty of cafes and good restaurants within a short walk of the hotel.As for the $$$ the Grosvenor is excellent value and despite the welcome we received we are happy to recommend it particularly to travelling families."
49,2058,"Nov 30 2008 	Tired and dated but good value for money in expensive SFO	I stayed for 7 days while attending a conference at the Moscone Center.The Grosvenor suits in a in fabulous location on Nob Hill. Safe neighbourhood and only a block to a cable car line, a 6 minute walk downhill to Union Square and about 15 minutes to the Moscone Center.It is certainly tired and somewhat shabby but still decent. Decor was once very nice but now dated. Suites are serviced daily, the kitchen cabinetry has been updated even though the stove is old. Kitchens have a full size fridge. The kitchen was very poorly equipped with only one very large saucepan and fry pan - and only a few utensils so any serious meal preparation was not practical.The weather was mild during my stay which was fortunate as there was NO airconditioning and the baseboard heating looked as though it probably didnt function. There was a pedestal fan in the hall cupboard.Staff were very helpful and friendly. I didnt partake of the continental breakfast so cant comment.The basement has a row of new &amp; clean commercial washing and drying machines. Very reasonable rates for using these machines. There are also snack vending machines down thereThe other advantage is that it has plenty of off street PARKING. $35,00 per day but worth it in this city where parking is very difficult in most areas.Would I stay there again? Most likely - if it wasnt high summer or mid winter. Despite its drawbacks, I thought it good value in an expensive city."
50,2058,"Nov 24 2008 	Great Location great staff	I have just returned from a 13 night stay at the Grosvenor, and couldn't recommend it highly enough.The location is perfect, handy to everything in San Francisco; views are fantastic and rooms are fitted out to a very high standard and excellent value for money. Their was no air-conditioning in my room, which might be a problem at some times of the year. The staff (particularly John and Tony) are exceptional, friendly and (with the exception of one night clerk) went out of their way to help me. If I had one gripe it would be that while the rooms do have a kitchenette with full-size fridge and cofee maker, the only cooking facility is a microwave, meaning I couldn't take advantage of the great produce at the Ferry Terminal farmers market. Book through the hotel's internet site rather than any of the third party sites if you're staying for longer than 7 days for their discount."
51,2058,"Nov 20 2008	Would stay here again	Just got back from SF. I stayed at the Grosvenor Suites downtown. It is centrally located near Union Square, Chinatown, and the Cable Cars. I recommend taking a taxi or cable car (if you don't have luggage) to get to the hotel since the walk up Powell is steep. Other than that, check-in went smooth. The guy who checked me in was very nice and made sure to book me a room with a view. I got a corner room on the eighth floor with a fantastic view. The room itself was very spacious. There is no air conditioning or heat in the room. It was hot when I arrived, so I opened the sliding glass door. They also have a tall fan in the closet that I used to cool things down. The bed was quite comfortable since I slept very well. It was not very noisy outside unless you open your sliding glass door. But once it was shut, it kept out most of the noise. I mostly heard a few car horns, some sirens, and the ding of the cable car, but it did not wake me up in the middle of the night. The furniture was a bit dated, but decent. The kitchen and bathroom had granite countertops. A few dishes, silverware, and pots and pans were provided, but I only used a plate and knife, which I made sure to wash. The stove/oven was outdated, but I made good use of the oven and it worked well. The bathroom was small, but it served its purpose. I did not like that there was not much counter space in the bathroom and the shower head is pretty low if you are tall. But it worked.The tv was another complaint. Some channels did not show up in the lineup and I had to manually punch those channels into the remote. A few channels were not very clear. The remote itself did not have an on button, only an off button, which I found odd. I had to get up to turn on the tv. Continental breakfast was decent. Nothing fancy. Just juices, coffee, bagels, cereal, etc. A computer is provided for your use, as well as an ATM machine, a laundry room, and snack/drink/ice machines. I did not like going down to the level where the snack machines were. Seemed a bit dark, like in a basement and I felt a little uncomfortable down there. The laundry room is also located on that level.Other than a few minor issues, I would stay here again. It was priced well and if you book online, you can get daily rebates, which saves you more money. It is a great place to stay if you are on a budget and want to be close to places like Union Square."
52,2058,"Nov 20 2008 	Enjoyed our stay	My husband &amp; I stayed here for 4 nights after a tedious 2-week package tour where we have to check in/out of hotel room almost everyday. We needed a hotel with lots of space, finally able to have some own cooked food, comfortable and not too far from U.Sq &amp; Chinatown. Grosvenor Suite was a great choice. There's lot of storage space - too much in fact unless you plan to stay for months, clean &amp; good firm beds. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Continential breakfast was much better than other hotels that we have been to. Downside was the bathroom a tad small and also the storage area in our bathroom smell musty as it was hardly used &amp; no ventilation. Yeah, it's a bit old and worn but we have no complain on that as the whole place is still very well taken care off."
53,2058,"Nov 16 2008 	Space and great views but wouldnt stay again	I booked this because we needed a cost efficeint place to stay as a couple with our grown up son on a short sightseeing trip to SF between visiting friends in Sonoma and travelling on to Charlston for a conference. Our primary concerns for this trip was that the hotel be cheap and spacious with a safe location close to the action and that is exactly what we got. The bonus was that the views from the 14th floor suite were brilliant , our son didnt close the curtains so he could fall asleep looking at beautiful S F twinkling below and listening to the Cable cars bells.... a truly unique experience we couldnt have had in lots of other nicer , pricey hotels. Given that bonus, and that it full filled our needs I feel bad about saying anything negative about the place , but we have to be honest on these reviews so that others can benefit from the comments and make an informed decision... so here goes.I found the place a bit seedy to be honest with some worrying safety issues. I expected dated and that was not a problem for me, older worn furniture was what I expected , but the level of maintaninence was what let the place down badly. The paintwork was chipped , walls marked, stained carpets, and a general sad air of disrepair prevailed about the place, some of it went beyond cosmetic being serious safety issues.The windows are single glazed with aluminium frames that actually opened which is needed as the place got really hot and no air con. Our smaller opening windows on the 14th floor were broken and just about hanging in there, god help anyone below when they eventually do break and the large shards fall 14 floors down. The smell in the corridors was not good, mainly from cooking odours I think, however our corner suite got the sun more or less all day and this warmed up the vinyl coating on the curtain linings and gave off a horrible toxic plastic smell that made me feel ill. The breakfast was a grab and go affair really as there was not enough seating to stay , so I just took the mugs from the room down and loaded upa a tray with coffee, juice and muffins. You have to stand and tell the lady behind the pastry counter what you want, she was very surly, never smiled and you felt like she begrudged you every item you took, not good.Staff on the front desk were Ok , some better than others.but at least it was always manned and they helped with taxis and directions with efficiency.Location not good if you have mobility issues , but then San Francisco is very hilly so I think you have to accept that and the walk down to Union Sq was easy as it was all downhill ad took about 6 mins.Just one thing I wish I had known , you can buy an all day pass on the Cable cars for $11 dollars. We bought $5 single tickets not realising , and I think this would be a fun thing to do staying at the Grosvenor as you could have a pretty good sighseeing tour of the city just using the CC's from this location.Best experience , Alcatraz night tour and wondering aroound the Hyde pier and along the beach at Aqua Park on a sunny afternoon, then over to the Chocolate place at Ghiradelli Square for an Ice cream sundae.Have fun."
54,2058,"Nov 15 2008 	Can't believe anyone gives this place 4 stars	Do not be deceived by the web site photos. I thought this place was a dump, and not a good value. The staff checking us in was incompetent (took forever to check us in, didn't have any record of the car we'd arranged for the next day and couldn't answer any questions - &quot;you'll have to speak to management in the morning&quot;), the room furnishings were old and cheap, the bed sagged, the room smelled like stale smoke (despite the fact that it was supposed to be a non-smoking room), the toilet flushed or didn't depending on its mood, and the shower head was set at the level of my chin. I was supposed to be at the Grosvenor for 2 nights but fled after the first. Booked a cheapy last-minute stay for only $40 more at the wonderful Orchards Gardens Hotel."
55,2058,"Nov 13 2008 	Convenient yes; attractive no. . .	My husband and I stayed at the Grosvenor Suites for four nights, November 5  9. We had a very spacious room on the 11th floor with a great view of the TransAmerica building. The room was a bit odd, but I really cant say anything bad about it. There was a large bedroom, a small bathroom and a large living room area with a dining table for four and a fully functional kitchenette. The rooms were all very clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and there were two dressers and three large closets. They serve a continental breakfast in a small room on the lobby level. The coffee was not very good, but they had a variety of juices, tea and pastry, donuts, bagels and cereal; a nice convenience for those who want to grab a quick bite and go. I would recommend the Grosvenor Suites to business travelers or those who plan on spending a majority of their time out and about. My husband easily accessed the BART system to several business meetings in Walnut Creek by walking down a few blocks to the station in Union Square (the walk back up to the hotel was a true San Francisco experience.) The hotel was by no means cozy, charming or particularly attractive; but its convenient location and room rates cannot be beat."
56,2058,"Nov 12 2008 	good value for the location	Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Grosvenor Suites on Nob Hill. We asked for and were give a corner view room. I booked it online directly with them. It was a large suite with lots of closet space. A small kitchenette was nice to have. The carpets were really dirty and I made my kids were socks or slippers all the time. The views were great, we had a small (scary) balcony that we didn't let the kids on. 2 queens in the bedroom and a pull out sofa in the living room. Room 1511.  I hadn't seen this mentioned on any other reviews, but the bathroom was TINY! I had to walk all the way in and then turn around to close the door. The shower was short (a major peeve of mine at 5'10&quot;). The heat (baseboard heaters) must have been on some sort of timer, every night they came on and were full force. We had the windows open every night. When we told the front desk, he just shrugged at me. I left a note for housekeeping and it was off when we got back in the late afternoon, but back on after we got back from dinner. The location is great...downhill to Union Square, but you can jump on a cable car to get back. We took several cabs, which were way cheaper than the 5 of us going by cable car. ($5 each one way) We did get a couple of complimentary rides on the CC's. I booked online and got a total of $70 off for an online rebate for the room.Secured parking behind the hotel was nice and at $35 night was a little less than the other hotels. Decent continental breakfast.If you go to the Academy of Sciences...buy your tickets online, go early and get your planetarium and 3D show time tickets as soon as you get in. If you have more than one adult...send one to get in line for the rain forest, one to the planetarium and one to the 3D. It was crazy busy on 11/10/08. Worth the waits, but will be much easier to navigate when the crowds die down."
57,2058,"Nov 8 2008 	Great Location	We stayed for 4 nights at the Grosvenor Apartments. Had asked for a room with good view but unfortunately we didn't get this. However, the room was spacious and the beds very comfortable. The apartments are looking a bit tired and dated and could do with some renovation but they are clean and you can't fault the location. Iron, hairdryer, t.v. etc is provided. Perfectly situated for sightseeing.The complimentary breakfast is basic - cereal, bagels and pastries etc but adequate.The staff are helpful and friendly, quickly found cab for us when required. Internet access in the lobby is free.If we return to San Francisco we would definitely stay at the Grosvenor Suites."
58,2058,"Nov 3 2008 	One of the bests	Fantastic. My family and I stayed there for a week. Spacious, great views, value for money, excellent and friendly service, great location. has a kitchen and 2 TVS.What else can you ask for?The Clarkes from Australia"
59,2058,"Oct 27 2008 	Nice area	Stayed here for 5 days on our trip to california. Good location in Nob-Hill which is an affluent area of san fran-certainly never felt threatened in this area, a concern on some other trip advisor reports of other hotels we looked at before booking. Rooms are a bit dated, however we didn't go to sit on our hotel! Found it a good base for our stay, room offered all normal hotel things, i.e. tv, iron, hair dryer, fresh towels daily etc + also gave free internet access. Breakfast was basic coffee and pastries, although if you didn't make it early enough the pastries would be gone. We absolutely loved San Fran-loads of touristy things to do + see, wine tasting, open top bus tour, walking tour, trip to yosemite, pier 39 (defo try clam chowder mmmmm), alcatraz, great shopping, chinatown etc etc etc Just never had enough time to do it all so hope to return and would certainly stay in grosvenor suites again. Try Loris' Diner round corner and 2 blocks down towards union sq for authentic american breakfast and for a nice touch try a drink at Mark Hopkins International Hotel opposite on the top floor with lovely city views!!"
60,2058,"Oct 25 2008 	Dated but of good value	5 of us stayed on the 15th floor, corner (1503) with 2 queens and a sofa bed. I was a bit dismayed by the drabness of the rooms and dirty carpet, but praise the location, the view, the helpfullness of the staff, the spaciousness of the living room, the full kitchen/dining area and the view, the view and the view. We had very warm days and cool nights, so found it nice at night, in spite of the city noise-loved to hear the cable car bell. The Powell (Hyde or Mason) Cable car stop is a block down a decent hill and the Mark Hopkins is directly across the street up a very steep hill. It costs about $8+ for a taxi from the Wharf and about $40-45 to the airport. You are 5 minutes away from Sears (for breakfast, even during lunch) and the shopping at Union Sq. and about the same from Chinatown. The wharf is better reached via Cable Car, trolley (from Powell/Market), taxi or bus. It is very doable (no hills) by walking to Chinatown, then through little Italy, but can be long. Our stay, with the on-line rebate averaged $200 a night, a steal in this city. I wish it had been better updated, the carpet scared me. I would recommend to families on a budget who want to stay on Nob Hill. The kitchen was great for bringing back cracked crabs and enjoying them in the room."
61,2058,"Oct 24 2008 	Good place for the value	Staff was friendly, rooms pretty clean. They have a free hot breakfast for staying with them which was really nice. Had no issues, close enough to SF to save money staying outside of the city."
62,2058,"Oct 22 2008 	Fantastic Value great to have extra space.	Decided to stay at the Grosvenor Suites based on TA reviews and were very happy with our choice.Our one bedroom suite was large, comfortably furnished , very clean and well equipped, although we were not fortunate enough to be allocated a high room with a view (we asked for one and were given the fourth floor with view of neighboring walls). Our suite had two queen size beds in the bedroom, plenty of cupboard space, a kitchenette with full size stove and fridge, a dining table with four chairs, a sofa bed and two tv's. The bathroom was indeed tiny, but served it's purpose with adequate hot water and sufficient towels.Found the location to be perfect being only a block from cable cars going in all directions and an easy walk down to Union Sq or Chinatown. The return journey was always slower as it is up a typically steep San Francisco hill, but we often caught the cable car to the corner of Powell &amp; Pine and then it was only a short gentle incline from there.Reception staff were for the most part extremely friendly, competent and helpful. One staff member we struck may be letting the side down, but I won't judge the majority on her poor performance.Breakfast was included in the room rate and is OK if you like pastries, bagels and sweet cereals and you could take a tray back to your suite if preferred. We would have liked some toast and healthier options, but maybe that's just our Kiwi tastes.Negatives: None. We found this accommodation to be fantastic value for money for our family of 4. It isn't flash, it doesn't have some services that some hotels offer, not all rooms have a view and some areas are showing wear and tear, but if you know this beforehand and are looking for excellent bang for buck then you should be happy here."
63,2058,"Oct 19 2008 	love the grosvenor	The staff are friendly and helpful. We had a lovely huge room with a kitchenette and a view of SF. A great value for the money.They had a great deal for reserving on their site.Only one criticism: although the coffee was excellent, the breakfast could use some updating - they do not have healthy suggestions.One caution: this hotel is on top of a very steep hill.We definately would stay there again."
64,2058,"Oct 19 2008 	Great location with precious space in SFO	We stayed for 4 nights 11-15 OCT in a 1 BR apt. 18th Floor and had a smooth stay. Great views of the bay. We were lucky that it was fleet week and could see the aircrafts zoom past from our window, not to mention the fireworks at night! Agreed that the bathroom was small but that is a small price to pay for its fantastic location. After hearing all sorts of stories about so many locations, this was was perfect. Situated a block from the Intercon / Fairmont on nob hill, posh area, we felt safe and could walk to china town/union square etc. Agreed that the hotel is on a slope and the upward walk can be hard, but only if you have any knee probs. Overall a good choice, especially if with family. We like spacious rooms so this was a treat. The breakfast could do with a few additions but for a start its not bad. We saw people Q-ing up for BF on the restaurants rond the corner so whatever little we got, was sufficient to kick start yoyur day. The rooms were clean and the reception staff was friendly. The tram is also round the corner to take you to the wharf/union Sq. I would defi recomend this place for a central location and the luxury of space for the price it charges! We would defi stay there whenever we go back to SFO! Do keep a map with you and know your surroundings as it all depends on what you a re looking for. The wharf was so crowded and touristy, so this area was good for us."
65,2058,"Oct 13 2008 	See San Francisco and get fit at the same time!	We stayed at Grosvenor Suites for 7 nights in early Oct 2008 - family with 3 girls aged 13, 11 &amp; 10. The location was great, being close to Westfield, the Bart and many bus stops to Fisherman's Wharf. We enjoyed cheap and cheerful meals at Chinatown for dinner (3 nights) and on another 2 nights even bought takeaway roast pork, rice and soy chicken (and cooked our own vegies also bought in Chinatown) back to the hotel for dinner. The hotel is on a steep hill (particularly the last 2 blocks) and gives you a great workout whenever you return. I found that I could run from Nordstroms at Westfield back to Grosvenor Suites in 13 minutes by the end of the week. (Still, I was late meeting the tribe by the promised time because there was just sooo much shopping to be done).The decor is a little dated, but everything was generally clean, except the vent over the stove. With our family of 5, we fit comfortably into the one bedroom suite. Hubby drew the short straw and slept on the sofa bed, which he did not find comfortable.The rest of us slept soundly on the 2 queen beds in the bedroom. We had a corner suite on Level 15 with a view of Transamerica Tower, with microwave, stove and large fridge. There was crockery and cutlery for 4 and basic pots, pans and utensils. The room was also relatively quiet, considering the city location, except for the one-off siren and the gentle tinkle of the cable cars in the night one block away.The staff were friendly and helpful. The manager kindly offered to call our bus when he saw us waiting at the door for our tour bus. Breakfast consisted of cereal boxes, bagels, danishes, tea, coffe and juices. The breakfast room only seated about 12 people, so sometimes we had breakfast &quot;to go&quot; and ate in our suite. We booked our suite throught the hotel website and receive an online rebate which basically covered the tax on the accommodation with about $20 to spare.Good value, family-friendly, great location, and a free workout to burn off the carbs - what more can you ask for?"
66,2058,"Oct 12 2008 	Fantastic place to stay	We stayed in a one bedroom suite with our teenage son and were upgraded upon check-in to a corner suite on the 18th floor - two lots of friends who stayed here since then were also upgraded on arrival. The location is excellent, the service friendly and the rooms spacious and although a little dated, very comfortable indeed, with a balcony and good views. A computer with free internet access behind Reception was a bonus. We walked to most places and there are some great little restaurants and bars within easy walking distance to the Grosvenor. Would definitely stay here again and am recommending this hotel to all our friends."
67,2058,"Oct 2 2008 	Great Value for Money	We spent 3 nights at the Grosvenor Suites in a 1 bedroom apartment in September. We booked this stay on the Grosvenor website which offered a rebate for booking on line. We had a corner suite and the view of the city was great. The suite had a kitchenette with microwave, oven, full fridge, etc. Although the decor was a little dated the suite was clean and had everything we needed. For what we paid we were really pleased with the standard of the suite.There was also a free Continental breakfast each morning which was good. The breakfast room is a bit small so we would get a tray and take it back to the room. The location was also great. Near two cable car lines and within walking distance to ChinaTown and Union Square (it is a bit of a climb on the way back!).I would really recommend the Grosvenor Suites and would stay again if I ever got the chance to get back to San Francisco."
68,2058,"Sep 20 2008 	Great value for money in fantastic location.	We stayed at this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews. We had booked directly with the hotel website and had requested a room on a higher floor and asked for the sofabed and extra rollaway bed to be in the suite.Check in was very easy and smooth and they put us on the 18th floor in a suite with fantastic views. The rollaway bed was not in the room, but came 15 minutes after being requested. The hotel also has a locked car park behind the hotel, the elevator goes to the car park level, and there are luggage trolleys, so getting the luggage to the room was not a problem. We could also see our car from the balcony  which was reassuring. We had to pay a $75 deposit for the key for the safe in our room, but it was refunded no problem when we returned the key.There are various comments from other guests that the rooms were not as nice as on the hotel website, but ours was exactly the same as the hotel website, so I think they must have upgraded some and not others. The dcor is not super stylish, but was clean and recently done. The bed was fine ( although the sofa bed and rollaway bed had thin mattresses ).This is a relatively low cost hotel. I felt the level of service and amenities were way above what I would have expected for the price. The location is fantastic, just a couple of blocks from Union Square, and China Town. One block from two different Cable Car lines, and one block from The Fairmont  which is where a lot of tours pickup and drop off. The breakfast is basic  but its free, and you are allowed to get a tray, help yourself and then take it to your room, which meant that we could be eating breakfast and getting ready at the same time. They have a free PC and printer, that meant I could book and print of tour/restaurant reservations. For the money I would absolutely stay recommend and stay here again."
69,2058,"Sep 19 2008 	Home away from home!	I often visit SF with friends and family for various reasons. One of them is for fun and shopping! Last week I stayed at the Grosvenor Suites with two girlfriends for this reason. I am always looking for a comfortable, well located, reasonably priced, clean and safe place to stay in the city. I hate spending too much because I am out all day but want a nice place to return to at night. Grosvenor Suites fit that bill. Staff was extremely friendly, parking (though pricy) was on site and safe, our large suite had all the comforts of home. A little worn but very very clean and comfortable. Our view out of our corner suite was fabulous. We had a kitchenette with m/w, oven, full fridge, etc. Continental breakfast was adequate but fresh. There is basically no lobby to lounge around in or onsite bar and restaurant but you can order food in from somewhere closeby. I would definately recommend this place and will return soon."
70,2058,"Sep 12 2008 	Good Value for the money	We stayed here with our 3 small children in a 1 bedroom suite.This is a good value hotel for the money.Yes, it is in need of some updates (and the curtains need cleaning), but overall it does the job.Great location, very clean, maid service was great, free breakfast,free internet,kitchenettes and there is a great pizza/pasta place on the next block (recommended to us by the staff).The staff were excellant except the 2 girls on the afternoon/evening, who were treated us like we were a total inconvenience, that would be my only gripe.Overall, a pleasant stay,would stay here again."
71,2058,"Aug 30 2008 	Hidden gem in San Francisco	My husband and I stayed here for 10 days in early August and had a wonderful experience. The staff is extraordinarily friendly and helpful. We had a great room with a balcony and a superb view of the city. Although it is much more like a European hotel (small and intimate), it was a perfect location on the top of Nob Hill (right across the street from the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental) and a great value for the money. Check their web site for an Internet rebate! We will definitely be back!"
72,2058,"Aug 25 2008 	Great Stay - Perfect Location	My family and I (2 adults, 2 young children) stayed for 5 days/4 nights in early August 2008. We had a wonderful stay. By far, the best features of this hotel are its location and the incredible views (it's a tall building near the top of Nob Hill).The location is perfect -- just one block from two cable car routes, only a short walk to Union Square, and only a short walk to Chinatown. We loved being in the middle of everything -- it was very convenient. The views were spectacular -- we had great views of Coit tower and the Transamerica building.We stayed in a one-bedroom suite. It had a nice kitchenette -- full sized refrigerator, stove, microwave oven, all the plates/glasses/utensils you would need. The unit was spacious. In addition to the bedroom and kitchen, there was a living area and a dining area. The rooms could use a little renovating, but it wasn't that bad. We were very happy with them.The continental breakfast was good -- bagels, pastries, donuts, cereal, coffee, juice. The wireless Internet worked great. The parking, while expensive ($35/day), was very easy and convenient. The staff was very friendly.Overall, we had great stay and would definitely recommend it."
73,2058,"Aug 21 2008 	Recommended but not for business travelers	I stayed here on a brief business trip after reading a lot of positive reviews online. I'm sure this hotel is fine for vacationers: the rooms are ok (especially the kitchenettes), the location is pretty good, and the staff are helpful. However, I don't recommend it for those who need to come back in the evenings and work on their computer. The lighting in the rooms is even dimmer than the hotel norm, and the wireless internet mostly non-existent (at least while I was staying). It just isn't worth it."
74,2058,"Aug 5 2008	Great location good service but very dated	We stayed there for 3 nights recently. We specifically chose this property as we were travelling with our 5 month old son so the in room kitchen facilities were useful. The only negative I have is the decor - still in its 1970s-style and our room wasn't particularly well maintained. A conduit covering was hanging off the wall and had clearly been that way for a while. On the plus side, the location is excellent, although the walk from Union Square gives your legs a great workout. Staff were fine, there's a useful laundry in the basement and the views are great. The bed was big and comfortable, very useful as we'd just arrived from Australia and were jetlagged. It was also very quiet within the hotel, the only sounds coming from the street outside, but the corner of Mason and Pine is actually a very quiet bit of Nob Hill.We had arranged for a child seat we bought on line to be delivered to the hotel, and the hotel handled this well, delivering it to our room when it arrived at the hotel.Overall, I'd probably still recommend Grosvenor Suites, as long as you're not expecting a flash new interior."
75,2058,"Jul 30 2008 	Really mixed feelings about the Grosvenor Suites	I can honestly say that I have never had such mixed feelings about any place my family has visited. There is so much about the Grosvenor that is simply 5 star: unbelievable views that any top of the line hotel would die for; nice layout of a small one bedroom apartment that was more than spacious for three of us; some tasteful updates like granite and modern fixtures in the very small bathroom; a fabulous location that really makes it easy to take advantage of everything San Francisco offers. And then there are some things that are strictly 1 star: chipped paint on window sills that have been repaired with mismatched paint; a crack in the window; tears in the linings of drapes; grimy door and window jambs; piled on grease on the exhaust fan in the kitchenette (so much that I wouldn't use the rangetop); a really suspect bedspread; broken heating covers. If it had not been for the 5 star elements, we would have checked out instantly. Gratefully, Housekeeping did an awesome job with daily cleaning, but really basic, quality maintenance is needed. Another reviewer said that this is not a luxury hotel and that is right on the money. The lovely rooms shown on their website are long term rentals only so be prepared for something less. If the units are maintained as they should be, there is no question that the Grosvernor Suites would be the best deal in town. I guess the bottom line is: would we stay again? ONLY if I researched all other options, and had the assurance from management that we would once again have the incredible views that make up for the inside of the unit."
76,2058,"Jul 8 2008 	Incredible Value	We just returned from our California/ Nevada vacation and spent 3 nights at the Grosvenor Suites. I cannot reccomend this place enough. We had a HUGE one bedroom suite (3 adults, 2 kids) with the most incredible views of San Francisco from the top of Nob Hill. The Living Room had windows on 2 sides that looked out to the water and down the hill to some beautiful churches, as well as the TransAmerica Building. Better views (IMO) then from the Top Of The Mark accross the street. We had a kitchenette that we used to store our wine, cheese, snacks and additional breakfast items to supplement the free breakfast provided buy the hotel. The hotel staff was very accomodating with extra requests for towels etc.. Parking was 35.00 a day but that's about average for San Francisco. Cable Cars are located at the corner making life very convenient. Wish the bathroom was bigger but other then that a great, great value. I will definitely stay here again...it was like having our own private apartment in the city."
77,2058,"Jun 30 2008 	Grosvenor Suites-Everything I expected	I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Grosvenor Suites. We arrived early at noon and was told our room was ready so we could check in! We were so happy with the size of the room. We had a one room suite, which consisted of a separate bedroom, full kitchen/ living/dining room areas surrounded by windows! We were on the 17th floor with a spectacular view! Everyone was so nice and helpful with directions, recommendations, etc.We are at Uncle Vitos around the corner for lunch. We called in for delivery from Pronto Pizza one night. Both were very reasonable!It was a wonderful location. One block to the cable cars, 2 blocks to Walgreens, one block to the market, short walking distance to Chinatown...One night we ventured over to The Top of the Mark for a drink! What a view that is!Took the cable cars and busses everywhere except for a Saturday night coming back from the Wharf, the cable cars were packed so we ended up walking all the way back! Only a couple tough hills! Take your time and you can do it!!Good to have breakfast included! Not nothing huge, but enough to get you going for the day!Got a great price for a great room! Would stay here for sure if I ever make it back to San Francisco!"
78,2058,"Jun 18 2008 	Great Location Geat Price Great Breakfast	We stayed at the Grosevnor Suites in the Spring of 2004 with a group of friends. We were very pleased with our experience. The hotel is located in a great location right on the cable car line in the Nob Hill area of town inbetween Union Sqaure and Fisherman's Warf. The continental breakfasts were superb! The rooms were large and even included a kitchen that we didn't use. In the Spring the price and location couldn't be beat, though in the Summer when the cable cars are a lot more crowded it may take longer to get places but walking is always an option! Don't miss the Nob Hill Cafe just a couple blocks away - amazing restaurant that is super popular with the locals so arrive by 5 or be prepared to wait - but its worth it!!"
79,2058,"Jun 14 2008 	More than we wanted!	We were sooooooo impressed with Grosvenor. Maybe it's because I knew big cities like San Francisco don't lend well to large hotel rooms. Whatever the reason, we thought Grosvenor Suites were exactly what we wanted and more.We got the smallest room and were still incredibly impressed by the size of the room. For a San Francisco mid-range hotel, this place has spacious rooms! The kitchen made our place really feel like home. And, we had TONS of closet space that was quite nice. Everything we needed - iron/ironing board, hair dryer, coffee pot, cooking utensils, eating utensils, etc. - we found easily in our room. The bed was comfortable. And, the view was so great.Service was good. We were greeted kindly upon arrival. The staff was friendly and the guy who checked us in even told us he would try and get us a great view, which he did. Any questions we had, though there weren't many, were quickly and effortless answered. Breakfast was pretty much your standard fare and was nothing impressive, but I never really include that meal in my stay anyhow.The location was possibly the best thing about this place, and that says a lot since we loved everything else. It was literally a block from the top of Nob Hill. This made it easy for us to walk to many of the major tourist attractions like Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square. There is also three cable car stops nearby (like one block!) and I believe other public transportation too.We were so very impressed with our stay. We will be recommending this gem to everyone we know and staying there on our next visit as well."
