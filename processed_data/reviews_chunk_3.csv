7,103,"Oct 31 2008 	Meeting planners beware	We used this hotel for a 2 day conference, and stayed here 5 nights in total.The hotel itself is positioned as business hotel so is slightly out of central Beijing. The rooms are fine and the hotel is in good condition - what you would expect from a Renaissance.The suprise came when our final bill arrived..... If you are a western company planning a business meeting then beware! Some of the points in our contract were lost in translation, and as a result we were charged a lot more for certain services than we were expecting - or they were worth. This tainted our stay, and means we will avoid using this hotel again for similar purposes!"
8,103,"Sep 2 2008 	Not good location	My second time in Beijing, I have stayed at the Renaissance as I was not able to find better location during Olympic. Hotel is brand new but the service and location where not good.I have tried to order room service but they came with the wrong dishes. Staff barely speak english and were maybe train quickly to open this hotel on timeRegarding location, it is better to stay in Sofitel."
9,103,"Aug 3 2008	Great place	This was one of our tour hotels. I was pleased how great it was. Rooms were 5 star western with all the amenities one could want including iron/board, robes, kettle, separate shower and bath and were very clean including carpets. Bed and bedding luxurious. The pool area was a nice place to cool off after a hot day. Breakfasts were included in our tour and included both asian and western items and freshly made omelettes or eggs.It cost me 14 yuan to take a taxi to subway and within minutes I was downtown. Totally travel time about 15 minutes.Starbucks right next door for those who can't do without a fix.Bar lounge had a great group singing. There is a convenience store almost outside hotel. There is an ATM in lobby or currencies can be exchanged at front desk."
10,103,"Jul 19 2008 	Great Location and Value	We were cautious about staying at this hotel because of its location. Like other tourists I would have preferred to be in near Tiananmen Square but honestly, I much preferred the hotel's site, which is in the northeast part of the city near the embassies and fantastic shopping, western-style bars and great Chinese restaurants. The taxi ride in took 15 minutes and cost about 25RMB tops. The hotel is modern, with a helpful doorman and front desk staff. The rooms are standard Renaissance - tasteful, functional and subtly luxurious. The health club was big (subpar equipment) and the pool was gorgeous, the perfect post-flight refresher. As a Platinum member I got to use the club lounge, which was fantastic and included a generous breakfast. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants at all (go and explore Beijing!). The only downside was no spa - just a sauna in the locker rooms."
11,103,Jun 12 2008	A great start in China	Our room was large and very comfortable. The decor was most attractive with lovely woods and other nice detail. We thought the breakfast buffet was very good and had much variety. The dining room was sunny and small enough to feel homey. Service was excellent and friendly.
12,103,"Apr 21 2008 	Nice welcome to Beijing	Great, comfortable hotel with good AAA discounts. Big, well-appointed room, clean spacious bathroom; friendly, English-speaking staff, and massage service in room and at the spa. Very nice, clean pool and well-furnished gym facility. Reliable, helpful staff helped us organize a half-day trip to the Great Wall with small bus tour (5 people total) and thorough guide &quot;Mike&quot; who spoke English well and told us fun, interesting facts about the culture and country as we visited. The tour cost us about $40 each and was well worth it. One down side to the hotel is the incredibly pricey breakfast... don't bother with it, go outside to the busy street and find something nearby, or if you are desperate, go next door to a small, but comfy Starbucks and have your American coffee fix or try a local specialty like a green tea latte. Great roast duck restaurant down the street for local cuisine at inexpensive rates. Nice intro to the culture and city, and easy to get to all the main places by taxi-- maximum 25 yuan -- about $3.50 from hotel to Tiananmen Square or Silk Market."
13,103,"Apr 6 2008 	Great Service -- Reasonable Rate	I stayed at the Renaissance for 8 nights in March. The hotel staff was great. If I called, I was always greeted by name. The hotel lounge band was excellent. I don't usually frequent hotel bars, but this band had me coming in every night (except Sunday when they are off).The breakfast was pricey, which is my only real complaint about the hotel. It's also not central to the &quot;tourist&quot; areas but the couple of days we had for sightseeing were not spent in traffic."
14,103,"Apr 4 2008 	Outstanding Hotel	I stayed a week in Beijing visiting my daughter. The hotel exceeded my expecations. From the help of the doorman whenever I needed a taxi, to the guidance of the concierge when I needed restaurant help, to the greetings of the front desk staff, everything was perfect. By the end of my stay, I was always greeted by name. The Club Lounge was exceptional. The staff was attentive in every way. The food was well prepared, the snacks were perfect. My room was large and comfortable. Housekeeping always made up the room quickly when I was out. I'm not used to an over the top review but this hotel deserves it. I used the health club each day. The equipment was fine though as is true of many urban hotels, more equipment would have been better. The pool was beautiful although I didn't use it. The hotel restaurants met my needs - a traditional 3 meal restaurant where you could get noodles or a hamburger and fries. The hotel has an upscale Chinese restaurant and a lounge with excellent live entertainment.My wife and I stayed at the Renaissance about a year earlier. We enjoyed our stay but since then the hotel has really polished its service. I had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend the hotel."
15,103,"Mar 18 2008 	Nothing to complain about!	I stayed here for work for 7 nights, and it had everything you need. The gym had decent facilities and even has an indoor pool, though a bit small, but enough to do some short laps. It has a safe, iron, a great view of the city (if the pollution gets blown away), and comfortable beds. The bathrooms are also very clean and modern. The staff is very friendly and the included breakfast at the 1st floor restaurant is excellent with both Chinese and western fare. Its location is the only thing that would potentially be a deterrent for choosing this place again. It is in the northeast corner of Beijing and probably a good 30 minutes from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and that's without traffic, which can add an extra significant amount of time. But the area is very safe and has a ktv and good restaurants across the street (namely the Bellagio). The only thing I found strange is there was no hairdryer. Maybe it was hidden somewhere but I didn't spend too much time looking for it."
16,103,Feb 26 2008	Loved	fd
17,103,"Nov 15 2007	Loved this hotel	I've stayed in beijing many times and this by far has been my favourite hotel, the only negative aspect is that some might find that it is not located in the city centre, but beijing is a huge city and taxi fare are extremely cheap. The service in the hotel is ecellent, the staff are truely very helpful and have from my experience a very good standard of english. The heath centre on the top floor is very modern and open very late and in room massages are cheap and include tip. I ate out every evening but the breakfast overed a good selection of both local and western food and a chef to cater to any other desires of their guests. all in all a very good hotel and a very enyoyable saty"
18,103,"Oct 30 2007 	Great Room Comfortable Bed	We spent a number of nights here as we attended a function in the hotel. Had a great big room with a very comfortable bed. Good bathroom with shower cubicle and stand up shower in the bath!Great shoe shine facility - very efficient free pickup and return.Breakfast buffet was ok - the fruit could have been better for such a good hotel and the service was not always as good as expected. This is not unusual for what we found around China. Overall though, no complaints.The hotel is about a 20-25 mins subject to beijing traffic taxi ride into the main tourist areas and taxis are cheap. It is also in a good location for visiting the great wall. We had a fantastic day at Jinshaling and went to Starbucks next door for a pick me up coffee after our climb! The hotel charges for intenet access which is a shame but starbucks has free wireless access!Went to a fantastic local restaurant so worth coming out of the hotel, turning right and walking down the road until something takes your fancy. Good little local supermarkets for snacks and cheap water.Heard about a great local flower market but ran out of time and never made it!"
19,103,"Oct 18 2007 	Great Hotel but on the Outskirts of town	We we allocated this hotel as a Priceline win and as such it was excellent value for money . The location is a little out of the centre but there are bars and restaurants in the area . Beijing is huge so you will inevitably need to travel by taxi during your stay . Taxis are very cheap but Beijing traffic is a nightmare so getting around town can be very tedious .On the plus side the hotel is near the Airport expressway so getting to the Airport is easy . The room was quite large with 2 double beds,very clean and comfortable and very much to the Renaissance &quot;formula &quot; .The bathroom had a separate bath and shower . We found the staff very attentive and courteous .Overall we had a great stay in Beijing and we had no problems at all with the hotel and would have no problems staying there again."
20,103,"Sep 6 2007 	Renaissance Rocks!	We stayed in the Renaissance last week while in Beijing. We changed to this hotel for the weekend after staying in the Presidential Plaza. This hotel was a dream. Its lovely, clean, the beds are comfy, the rooms are big (really big), and the bathrooms are really nice. The health club is clean and modern, and the indoor pool is also nice. My husband and I got foot massages in our room which were also really nice, inexpensive, and including tip!The staff here was quite fluent in English and easy to communicate with. There is only caveat with which I recommend this hotel. Location. This hotel is in the embassy district, the area with the huge ex-pat scene. Its not downtown Beijing, but taxis are so cheap it didnt matter for us. Vha meyvin yavin: this hotel is extremely shomer shabbos friendly!"
21,103,"Jun 21 2007 	Great Hotel	This was a heavenly hotel with many important features. Wonderful beds, lots of strong hot water, great facilities including gym and pool, wonderful staff, especially Fred the head concierge who made life easier for us, and reliable broadband, essential for the business traveller.The food and drink was good throughout the various restaurants and bars.Being a new-ish hotel it was clean, tidy and had excellent facilities. Excellent."
22,103,"Jun 11 2007	Good Hotel - With Some Cautions	My wife and I stayed here for four days recently while touring China and Japan. I travel for business in Asia periodically. First the positives: -- Clearly a new property/recent renovation - overall in good condition. -- Large room, with Marriott's new bedding that I expect from stays in the states -- There is a Starbucks immediately next to the hotel -- Nice dining option right across the street called &quot;Bellagio&quot; Negatives: -- About a 25-35 minute drive from most sights you want to see (about $8-12 USD per trip each way) depending on traffic. -- Cab drivers do not know this hotel - at all. Due to it being a new hotel I think....if you leave the hotel by cab you MUST take a card from the front desk that you can give to drivers. -- Getting from the airport is tough - the hotel web site does not have a way for you to print the hotel name and location in Chinese characters - and none of the drivers know the hotel. We had to drive to a near by, better known hotel and the front desk there helped us get to the Renaissance. For this reason alone I would not send co-workers or friends to this hotel. -- The staff's English is not up to par with other hotels I have stayed at in mainland China. And they are a bit aloof.-- At 4am one night a loud alarm clock in the unoccupied room next to us went off and it took 1.5 hours to resolve with the front desk clerk who seemed completely annoyed to have to help us. So overall - solid physical condition, but hard to get to and staff is weak for a Marriott. Pricing was OK. If going back to Beijing I would choose another location."

1,104,"Sep 22 2009 	Truly an heaven on earth	I stayed at the Shangri-la Beijing on my trip to China along with my friends, The Shangri-la hospitality was amazing and the Staff impeccable. I truly salute the wonderful Chinese hospitality"
2,104,"Sep 16 2009 	Very good 5 star hotel but too far from center	I have stayed for 3 nights in July 2009. The hotel is very good for 5 stars (above Marriot, Hilton, etc). The room is big and the service is good. The spa is great (one of the best I have ever seen) with a very good jacuzzi. Unfortunatelly it is very far from the center of Beijing (about 25 minutes by taxi) but taxies are cheap (You pay around 8 - 10 USD for the trip to the center). The prices for having dinner in the hotel are outrages for Beijing (around 100 USD for 2 persons while outside you can eat very good food for 30)."
3,104,"Sep 7 2009 	Could be better	We had high expectations - this was the last stop on a trip to China and we had stayed in some fabulous hotels during our 17 day visit. I should have looked into the location more - we were only there for two nights and we had visited Beijing before but some time ago. The hotel is not convenient for anything. It is the other side of town to the airport and given the traffic issues, 30 minutes or more from most places you would want to visit as a tourist.Whilst the staff spoke English, it was not to the standard expected from a 5* eastablishment. There were some bizarre recommendations - we were staying in the most expensive wing of the hotel and the recommendations included a dreadful fake market as a top sight. It took over half an hour to get to and was hard to get back from - and completely rubbish selling nothing you would want. After Shanghai the shopping here was awful.On arrival at the hotel the concierge questioned us - doubting we were staying in the Valley Wing - not a good start. The Valley wing lounge has a view which is like a cross between the A4 or Hammersmith Flyover and Spagetti junction. This was the same view as from our room.The restaurant service was poor - we were made to feel less than welcome when we truned up at 9.30 and last orders were 10pm. The staff were much more interested in going home that serving us.The rooms were comfortable and the lounge offered a free flow of Champagne all day and canapes early evening. The canapes were not as good as at some other hotels we have stayed in, including on this trip. The pool was not particularly inviting, especially given the plastic lane dividers that made it look like a public baths, rather than a plush, comfortable 5*retreat."
4,104,"Jul 27 2009 	Good	Nice hotel, a long way from the centre.Very friendly staff, good Horizon Club lounge."
5,104,"May 4 2009 	Excellent Hotel with friendly staff and wonderful amenities	Our first visit to Beijing. This choice of hotel certainly contibuted to a great visit to this interesting city as it was wonderful coming back to the hotel after a hectic day of sightseeing to be greeted by freindly staff and to have access to a great choice of restaurants on site, a superb gym and to have a comfortable room to return to. Only downfall is the location which is far from downtown as such but this does not influence one's visit if arranging sightseeing tours (through the hotel concierge desk) that collects and drops-off at the hotel. Service staff try hard to speak English with no problems in communication. Superb buffet breakfast and a great choice of various food on the menus at the different restaurants to satisfy all tastes for dinner."
6,104,Feb 9 2009 	Superb in every respect	Oustanding in every respect. Valley Wing Club and rooms are outstanding and service impeccable. Faultless.
7,104,"Aug 3 2008 	nice hotel	Great staff and nice lobby. Rooms of average proptions though. Well stocked tea/cofee making facillities. Large beds and very comfy mattresess. However it is a bit far away from touristy bits of the city. Overall no major complaints, however impersonal and a bit cold like many large sized chain hotels!"
8,104,"Jun 20 2008 	Beautiful Shangri-la	We spent three nights at the very beautiful Beijing Shangrila. Excellent staff- some with good English!Our twin-room on the 24th floor was very comfortable and spacious. Powerful shower and TV with BBC, HBO and ESPN for us to catch the US Open Golf!Breakfast was fantastic. A huge selection of Western and a several Chinese dishes. They have a beautiful garden with a charming bar where we sat out one night for a midnight snack.The only quibble I have is with the location. A little off the beaten track for sightseeing. That said, when one got back after a long day, this was the place you wanted to be in to unwind and relax- comfort to the max.We were part of a conference so our stay was taken care of. For our extended private visit we did moveto a hotel in the centre of the city (The Kapok, also reviewed) to be in the thick of things."
9,104,"Jun 7 2008	Great breakfasts / deal difficult membership program	Great buffet breakfasts and deal for this hotel, especially during the 1-week Mid-Year China Holiday in which all hotels in the financial district had large discounts. Buffet breakfasts at this Shangri-La were excellent. Connected to a mall, for convenience.Only minus: Membership program was poor. We stayed 10 nights, only to be offered the opportunity to *start* a membership (and our nights weren't counted towards the membership)."
10,104,"May 14 2008	Nice hotel for the money	They must have recently updated the rooms and infrastructure as everything was clean and new(ish). The rooms were large and the beds had nice linens. Good bath products and decent towels.The breakfast buffet is varied if a little bland, but the traditional Chinese fare was very good. Give congee a whirl.The gym and spa facilities were extremely nice and clean and a great way to work off some jet lag.Good service and an overall good experience for the business traveler. The 'big' attractions are a $4 cab ride away, but with Beijing traffic is kind of doesn't matter where you stay anyway."
11,104,"May 9 2008 	Big Hotel	I attended a conference at the hotel and found it to be grand, flashy and another really big, expensive hotel. There was nothing wrong with it but it offered an experience that was repeatable at virtually any big hotel in the world. It had Chinese folks working and a Chinese garden but had that &quot;global&quot; feel that is universal. The location is a bit remote, and, given Beijing traffic, a good hike to the central sites. But taxis are readily available and inexpensive. On the night I arrived, it was late and rainy so I went to the cafe for food and spent as much for a plate of spaghetti as I had for four really excellent dinners in Shanghai at a local place. Regardless of the location, I rarely feel that there is much value in this kind of hotel. They are very friendly in that &quot;here's what you do&quot; kind of way as they charge outrageous sums for virtually every transaction. The room was lovely, the pool and other facilities were excellent, and the kitchen provided tasty meals but otherwise I could have been anywhere on the globe."
12,104,"Apr 19 2008 	Probably OK as businessman's hotel lousy location for everybody else	Booked this hotel as an Oceania pre-cruise option, hence I didn't choose the hotel, it was the only one offered. This hotel and its sister in Kowloon where we stayed after the cruise, couldn't be more different.Where Kowloon was in the thick of it, this hotel is so far removed from the centre of Beijing that you might as well be in another city. OK, so it's not a million miles from the Summer Palace, but you couldn't walk there so that doesn't help much. No, with the exception of the Great Wall at Badaling (where you're nearer to it than from any other top hotel in Beijing, the only problem being that the Great Wall at Mutianyu is far superior and is in the opposite direction!) there is NO reason to stay in this location. If I ever return to Beijing (and it would have to be a damn sight warmer for me to do this) I want to stay within walking distance on Tiananmen Square.Where Kowloon had the world on its doorstep, here there are virtually no worthwhile shops or restaurants within walking distance - although the one eatery we found (where they spoke no English, hence lots of pointing) provided a halfway-edible meal, with several courses and 2 large beers for change out of 7.00 sterling.Where the staff and admin in Kowloon was a well-oiled machine, this one needed some maintenance. Exception: Justin the concierge who found us a driver out to the Wall at short notice and who knows his stuff.Where the view from our room in Kowloon was awesome, in Beijing it was ghastly (see photo). Room quality also not up to much, but then it was a better quality room we had in Kowloon.Where the Kowloon (Horizon Club) breakfast was fantastic, and included in the (admittedly high) price, here it was mediocre and damned expensive for what you got, which is why we skipped breakfast one morning out of two.Only bright spot was the in-house Chinese restaurant, where we had a nicely presented meal, with a good bottle of wine, for less yuan than I was expecting.All in all, forget this hotel as a place to stay in Beijing if you're paying and you therefore get the choice. I suppose that if you're in Beijing on business and if you have absolutely no interest whatsoever in what is outside the front door of your hotel, and your contacts come to you, then there might just be some point. But if this is where you fit in, why not stay nearer the airport? Or better still, stay at home and use video-conferencing!!"
13,104,"Apr 16 2008 	fantastic time	I can not believe that this hotel does not fall higher up in the ratings for hotels in Beijing.Over the past few years, we have stayed in quite a few Shangri La hotels, but was least looking forward to staying here becasue of the reviews.The hotel itself is smaller than some of the others and is a taxi ride out of the city. (never costing more than 2 to travel anywhere, usually about 50p!) When we arrived at the hotel, we were shown to our room by a lady in guest relations. It was our anniversary and there was a cake, box of chocolates, red roses and a bottle of wine waiting for us. The lady wanted to take our photo, but declined due to 15 hrs travelling. Felt really bad about this later. Everywhere we went in the hotel, we were greeted by name. The service really was exceptional!We had a high floor looking over the city and gardens. We even had blue sky on one day!Breakfast was fantastic, so much to choose from. We also stayed at the Shangri La in Shanghai, but preferred this one.Highly recommended!"
14,104,"Apr 12 2008 	Excellent Hotel Location OK	We spent 3 days here at the end of March. Our room was in the tower and was, by American standards, a little small. In UK terms it was quite spacious. The bed a full kIng size was very comfortable and the room was very quiet. The bathroom had a shower separate from the bath a real personal plus point.Our view was out of the back of the hotel over the gardens and was fine, I expect rooms on the south side overlooking the highway intersection may be a little noisier. Others have remarked on the proximity of the intersection but we did not find it intrusive. We've stayed in far noisier city hotels elsewhere. In fact on a positive note the location on the third ring road made it easy to travel away from the hotel. But the location is quite isolated - we had transport so for us this was not an issue. But without it I would expect this could be a problem. In fact the only problem with an otherwise flawless hotel.Service was excellent - attentive, friendly, and everyone we encountered had enough English for us to successfully communicate our requirements.The breakfast buffet was enormous and I would defy anyone not to find something to eat either Oriental or Western in addition there was an a la carte menu we didn't need to sample. We also ate here - a light meal in the Yi cafe late one evening and even though they were about to stop serving we were not rushed and watched as they dismantled and removed the ice sculptures from the buffet for repacking in the freezers!Check in was quick and efficient, and I was addressed by name, always a nice touch.All told this was a great first 'Shangri La' experience and one I would repeat without hesitation."
15,104,Apr 10 2008	Mixed experience	Stayed here for 3 nights as part of post-cruise package. Room was in the older wing and showed its age a bit--could use updating. Best part of the experience there was the food in both the Coffee Shop and the Blu Lobster. Also lovely garden which is a respite from the crazy traffic. Location is not great--not pedestrian-friendly. Staff speaks little English but are very nice and try hard to accomodate.
16,104,"Mar 24 2008 	Fantastic	Booked this hotel last August reason being as my daughter is at the university in that area so location wise it suited us brilliantly, so after reading reports about this hotel after I had booked it I was thinking I had made a mistake.. Not to be , we stayed in the orinal part of the Hotel not the new wing, rooms maybe a tad dated but fine infact the beds are the comfiest...Breakfast was just brilliant there was such a geart selection that i couldnt even list everything, staff were polite and charming, not hovering over you wanting to be tipped... but Beijingers do not expect to be tipped so dont.Both restauruants in the hotel were brillant... Blu Lobster was the most probably the best I have had the pleasure to eat in... if its good enough for Celine Dion well.......there you go.Location wise yes it is somewhat out of the way... taxis are cheap, I wouldnt recommend the subway as we used it but my daughter is used to it and can speak the language, we did the major attractions and the longest we were in a taxi was about 40 mins... in fact I was glad i booked this hotel and not one nearer to the other attractions, beijing is ssooooo big you will always be stuck in some kind of traffic...."
17,104,"Jan 21 2008 	Fantastic if you want to be away from the centre of Beijing	First of all, this hotel is really far away from the centre of Beijing (ie Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City etc). I'm talking a 30 minute ride in a taxi. Yes, taxis are extremely cheap in Beijing, but I didn't enjoy spending 5 hours a day in them getting to an from our hotel.Also, being in this location, there are no restaurants or shops anywhere nearby. Nothing worth visiting is within walking distance, so you need to be aware you are very isolated, but to be honest, I was relieved we weren't staying in the centre of the city. It was a relief to get back to our peaceful hotel each day.The restaurants in the hotel were superb. I don't usually like eating in the hotels too much, I think it's important to get out there and 'be with the people', but we had so much trouble finding restaurants where menus were written even partly in English (KFC was really our only choice-if you're a fan, you'll be in heaven in Beijing), so we ate in the hotel every night. The food was amazing - I was never disappointed. It's not cheap though, so bring a credit card with a big limit.The hotel itself is nice. We were in a suite, and it was ok. A little dated, and the zebra print on the walls was a bit hard to get used to, but having 2 bathrooms was fantastic.The Horizon Club was ok (staff were fantastic) but next time I'd stay in the Valley Wing. Much nicer for a very similar price.The only bad thing I can say is the service in the lobby lounge broke my heart. We went there one day after going to the Great Wall, and the girls working there wouldn't let us have a table (perhaps because we looked too 'touristy' compared to all the business guests). I was furious and absolutely mortified. I went up to my room and got a bit upset and had a bit of a teary moment, but the girls in the Horizon Club were really nice to us, so it wasn't everyone in the hotel who was rude. The guys on the door definitely deserve a mention - they had the best English of anyone in the hotel, they were funny and a pleasure to see each day.All in all, this hotel is probably more suited to business travellers than tourists. We did not see one other tourist in the hotel for the entire week while we were there and we were told they were running at about 80% capacity, so you may feel like a fish out of water if you're on holiday."
18,104,"Nov 1 2007 	Great service and comfortable rooms but isolated location	If you need or want to stay in the western part of Beijing, Shangri-la is a great option. Rooms are spacious and well-appointed, and hotel staff is eminently professional and courteous. Restaurants are all great, though pricey-- partly because of the dearth of competition in the neighborhood. Shangri-la is designed to be a small oasis in the city, and it succeeds in this, but as a consequence, you tend to pay for it through high-priced food/drink and other amenities. Still, this is my first choice anytime I come to Beijing for an extended period."
19,104,"Oct 24 2007 	I miss the Shangri-La Beijing	From the outside it doesnt match how the inside looked like. The front desk, concierge desk and the restaurant at Cafe Cha were great. They were all very helpful. The rooms were so environmently friendly with their key card as a slot for turning on the lights to a friendly reminder of where your key card is. Everything was labeled with what switch goes to what. Their use of furniture is so smart and friendly. The beds to their roll away bed are comfortable. Even if you are there for one night, you must try their jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. Their heath center spa was a great bonus! they have a swimming pool that is beautiful, you wouldnt think it was a swimming pool. They have all these amendities for you. They're breakfast buffet is out of this world and their dinner buffet Desserts are incredible. If you venture out remember to ask the Concierge desk to recommend places to go for a bite. They are prompt, safe and clean. I would definitely go back the Shangri-la."
20,104,"Oct 21 2007	OK as far a as travel group htoel but....	We first stayed at the Grand Hyatt Beijing, then transferred here rto begin our Viking river cruise experience.NOT a 4 star hotel, even in China. Maybe a 3. Staff did not really understand English, and were a bit surly. Room certainly was not 4 star. Food not much better,although breakfast buffet was quite good. Right on a major highway, more polluted than most locations from auto smog. Lousy location also caused us to have to taxi for dinner quite a distance.Bed not very comfortable, AC marginal. Avoid if you can."
21,104,"Oct 20 2007 	Stay in the Valley Wing!	From reading reviews it appears choice of which wing you stay in is critical to your opinion of this hotel. I stayed in the Valley wing during my stay and found it to be and extremely comfortable and enjoyable experience.From the check in, where the reception staff escorted you to the room for check in, to the check out where same staff escorted you to the taxi, the service was impeccable.The room was comfortable and practical including king size bed, walk in robe and flat screen TVs in both living room and bathroom (the bathroom a smaller version built into the mirror). For business the desk was set up with multi adapter sockets on the power and the broadband service was free, although a little slow.The Valley Wing has a business lounge on the 12th floor which serves complimentary food and wine throughout the day with an open bar happy hour from 5-7pm- the scene of a few late nightcaps and cause of a few early morning headaches. The breakfast and dinner(snack) buffets were small but good quality.The gym is modern and well equipped although can be a little busy in the morning. There is also a great 25m lap pool.Not matter which wing you stay the hotel is a long way from the centre- approximately 30min by car and the subway is also not convenient to the hotel. There is a travel desk which is efficient in organising either personal or group tours which were good value (personal day tour to Great Wall and Ming Tombs was approx. $150). Restaurants in the hotel are expensive( very!), and would be better advised to travel outside for dinner.In all, recommend if staying here that you upgrade to the Valley Wing and enjoy an extremely comfortable hotel experience."
22,104,"Oct 5 2007 	OK hotel could do better	On arrival the receptionist 's attitude was cold and uninterested and despite reconfirming our booking by email they put us in a smoking room which smelt heavily of smoke. My wife rang down and was told they could not do anything until the following day so I went back down to reception and demanded a move. They gave us a non smoking room as required which was obviously for another person as it had a greeting card with fresh fruit saying welcome back Mr xxxx . This 5 * hotel is in a city location but has wonderful gardens to walk thorough. It is quite an old hotel that has been revamped. The bedroom dcor is a bit basic and boring with not much attention to detail. That is to say they dont seem to clean in every corner and our fruit was growing fur by day three and no one had changed it. Bedrooms are ample size but lack storage space and have fridge, kettle, safe, self charging torch and smoke masks! The beds are comfortable with a choice of pillows as all Shangri la hotels offer. There is a writing desk with internet access. A large swimming pool and spa centre on the 5th floor is open 6am -11pm and they provide towels, bathrobes and slippers. The Caf Cha serves breakfast and international meals from 6am- midnight and has a great view over the garden area. Blu Lobster restaurant serves Western Cuisine, Nishimura Japanese Cuisine and Shang Palace Cantonese Cuisine. All are a very good standard and vast choice. The waiting on service is efficient and pleasant. I have stayed in five Shangri la hotels and they have been terrific however this one is in need of some T L C. I think they could do better."
23,104,"Sep 30 2007 	Okay hotel bad location for leisure travelers	Having stayed at the Kerry Centre many times, I had high expectations for the Shangri-la. While the hotel was okay overall, I wouldn't suggest that others going to Beijing stay there unless they really had to be in that part of town. I had two rooms: the first was a horizon level room in the Garden wing, the second was a Valley wing room. The Garden wing room was not particularly nice - it reminded me of the Excelsior in Hong Kong. The room is small but adequate. The decor is okay, but not particularly nice. Certainly not as nice as the Kerry Centre or the Peninsula. The real problem with this room was noise. I could hear the upstairs neighbors - kids who jumped on the floor until the wee hours of the morning. I moved to a Valley wing room at the suggestion of one of the hotel staff. This room was much nicer - larger, more natural light, a much nicer bathroom, a sitting area separate from the sleeping area. Importantly, I could not hear the neighbors. I was much happier with this room overall. However, I still think it's a bit much to force people to pay extra to stay in the Valley wing to have what they should expect: a room that offers the ability to sleep in peace. The gym is nice - but not any better than the one at the Kerry Centre. I had a massage in the spa and found it to be only okay. The Chi spa chain has a weird way of branding their spa treatments - lots of tea and bells and stuff I don't care about at all. I wasn't there to feel beautiful or whatever they imagined brought me to the spa; I was there because my back never really recovered from the 14 hour trip to Beijing. As elsewhere in the hotel, they tack on a 15% service charge. They also seemed to expect a tip in addition to this, which I found very cheeky. The food was okay but not great - pretty much what I would expect from a hotel. It was, of course, vastly overpriced. While this is what I expect, it's especially annoying because this hotel is located pretty far from commercial districts where there would be more choice. In fact, it's surrounded on two sides by motorways that are pretty much jammed all day long. That sight, and the thought of being stuck for hours in traffic, did not inspire me to go out and be adventurous, something I always did when staying in Chaoyang (where the Kerry Centre is). Overall, this hotel is okay in a pinch - when you need to be out in that part of town. But I would not put it on my short list for any other reason."
24,104,"Aug 8 2007 	Luxurious Experience	Made reservation with Shangri-la Beijing mainly because our son joined a Summer Camp located in the same Haidian area, and I was attracted to the hotel's &quot;value package&quot;, which included free breakfast, internet access, laundry &amp; dry-cleaning, &amp; airport transfer. We requested pick-up from another hotel instead of the airport &amp; the arrangement was hassle-free. A few days before check-in, we got an invitation from the hotel to pay a higher rate (+ free room upgrade) to try their new Valley Wing, and we agreed. So we practically changed from the most basic to the most expensive room category by paying 400 (+applicable tax) more per night.We have to say the experience was great (though it could have been better)! We were picked up from another hotel by an Audi, greeted at Valley Wing's entrance by an elegant Valley Wing Receptionist, Sally, and escorted to our room, where check-in was done inside the room. The room was nicely prepared with welcome tea, fruit, chocolate, and even stationary with my husband's name pre-printed. It could have been perfect if the followings have not happened: (1) We made reservation for a twin room but were given a dbl room; (2) The room was a connecting room, but the door between the 2 rooms could not be closed; (3) We were not given any introduction to the hotel at all. We ended up going to the business lounge in the old wing instead of going to the Valley Wing. It would have been really impressive if we had a briefing on the facilities of the hotel/ room. Instead, without even appologizing on having mixed up our room, Sally just led us to the new room &amp; left. Moments later, the house-cleaning lady brought the tea, fruit, &amp; chocolate from the other room to our new room, but of course, the impression was discounted.Overall, service in the Valley lounge was of high standard, with esp. credit to Alice &amp; Britany. They made you feel they took extra care. The moment you entered the lounge, the receptionists would greet you &amp; one of them would bring you drinks. One late evening, we had a drink at the lounge, and I found a small mosquito laying dead on one of the pastry, they immediately took everything away, appologised whole-heartedly, promised they would improve on bug-control, &amp; brought us some new ones (not completely defrosted) from the fridge. Apart from that incident, food quality was good. The lounge receptionists arranged our dinner reservation at their famed Chinese restaurant, and we were able to get a nice table by the window.Laundry service was excellent. We moved in with loads of dirty laundry, and check-out with everything washed, ready for our remaining trip to Hong Kong. The small herb-bag they added when the laundry returned was an impressing touch.Overall, an enjoyable first experience at the Shangri-la!"
25,104,"Jun 28 2007	Out-of-the-Way Group-Oriented Hotel	We stayed at the Shangri-La Beijing for three nights as part of a pre-cruise package. For the previous five days when we were traveling independently, we stayed at The Peninsula Beijing. Though both are 5 star hotels, there is no comparison. The Peninsula wins on all counts.The Shangri-La is quite far from all of the major sights except the Summer Palace. Because of The Peninsula's central location, we could walk or take short taxi rides to the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Wangfunjing Street, the Back Lakes, Drum Tower, Jinshan Park, the Temple of Heaven, and Lama Temple wasting almost no time in travel. From the Shangri-La these must-see sights are 45 minutes to over an hour away by taxi.The room at the Shangri-La was in the older tower. It was quite large with a comfortable bed. The bath had a tub/shower combination. Unlike many newer hotels, there was no separation of the sinks/toilet/tub areas. Rooms in the new tower may be more modern and luxurious in appearance and function. Much is made of the hotel's location in a park-like, garden setting. In fact, the hotel surrounds a small green area made to look like old Beijing. It is nice but in no way a real park  just hotel hardscape and landscaping.Except for an ample buffet breakfast which was part of the pre-cruise package, we ate only one meal in the hotel. Surprisingly for such a large hotel, no full-service restaurant was open throughout the day. We settled for deli fare beside the larger lobby restaurant for a late afternoon meal. The charge for two hot sandwiches with fries, some slaw, and two cokes was $55.00  quite expensive for what it was.Like the Shangri-La hotels in Bangkok and Hong Kong (Kowloon), this one seemed more oriented toward large groups attending conferences or on tours. It lacked the distinguishing personality and character of many 5 star Asian hotels. But more important its location gave no hint that the visitor was in Beijing. It could have been in any busy, commercial area surrounded by freeways in Asia. For anyone who prefers easy access to sights and freedom to walk to at least some of the sights that they want to see, I would not recommend this hotel."
26,104,"Jun 21 2007 	luxury	Although I was wary of what 5 stars might mean in China, the Shangri La is without a doubt the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. Rooms have every amenity you could think of, and many you can't! Def fulfulled my expectations. Hotel caters to westerners, so finding extremely helpful staff that spoke understandable English was easy, as was finding recognizable food and drinks. Two standout areas: 1) The gym/spa is incredible. The wood panelled free-weight room will make you want to lift all day! 2)The coffee. Seriously, it and the whole breakfast buffet was awesome. Other recommendation - the garden bar is a great place to enjoy a drink and a Beijing night."
27,104,May 3 2007 	great hotel bad location	The hotel and the amenities were everything I expect in a Shangri-la hotel. I stayed there for 2 nights in the new tower. The room was large and clean and well maintained. The fitness center was well equipped. The food was good and there were lots of options.Access to and from the hotel was easy with Taxi's.The only negative I have for the hotel was it's location. I like to explore the area I'm staying in by walking around. There was nothing around the hotel nearby (within walking distances). You have to know where you want to go and get a taxi to get there.
28,104,"Apr 29 2007 	Top Notch	Had a 4 night stay in March and these were our observations.Staff - Wonderfull - nothing was too much for them.Food - Buffet breakfast superb - plenty of western and eastern choices both of very high quality. We also ate in the bar 1 night with very good &quot;nibbly food&quot; which was actually hideously expensive.Rooms - we had a room on the top floor with a great view - seperate walk in shower , lovely amenities , slippers , robes , spotlessly clean.Location - not a great deal for tourists in local area - there is a supermarket in the basement of the shopping mall if you come out the hotel at the front entrance turn right and walk for 2 minutes. Taxi to the local subway station was 15rmb ( 1 ) or to Tiannamen square was 44rmb ( 3 ).Facilities - Had magnificent couples massage at the spa which was out oif this world - best spa we have ever been to oozing class - swimming pool pretty small and a big let down for what is a super hotel."
29,104,"Apr 14 2007 	Comfy Hotel Great Service - Make sure the location is right for you.	The Shangri-La Beijing is a very high quality hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff are very courteous and comfortable speaking English. I took advantage of their car service from the airport and was surprised to be greeted at the door and accompanied to my room for in-room check-in.We tried two of the restaurants in the hotel. Cafe Cha has an incredibly diverse buffet with many different styles of food and several stations for made-to-order dishes. Shang Palace had fantastic local cuisine with high class service. We were disappointed that the other restaurants they were advertising in the hotel were not yet open.The location of the hotel probably isnt ideal for tourists. There just wasnt much to do within walking distance of the hotel. Fortunately, taxis are cheap and readily available at the hotel. If I go back to Beijing for tourism, I would try to find a place closer to the Wangfujing area.My partner had a massage at the hotel spa and gave it good reviews although he was surprised by the offer of massage down there at the end of the hour. The fitness centre has a lap pool, multi-purpose resistance machine, and a small selection of free weights. Its enough to get by but might be a bit frustrating for someone used to a full-service gym. In summary, it was a very pleasant stay in a comfortable room with high-touch service. If the location makes sense for you, wed definitely recommend this hotel."
30,104,"Apr 12 2007	A Hotel which Oozes Excellence	The Shangri-La Beijing acts as a beautiful and idyllic retreat from the hustle and bustle city that is Beijing. The rooms are more than just clean, or neat, they are amazing. The cuisine is better than fine, or nice, it is exquisite. The staff surpass all expectations of what one defines as service, the staff are simply brilliant. The physical hotel itself is marvellous; the lobby with its marble floors heighten the sense of luxury and grandeur. However, the greatest aspect of this hotel is the beautiful gardens which are kept to perfection. The Shangri-La Beijing really is an exceptional hotel and any chance to stay here should not be missed."
31,104,"Mar 16 2007 	so-so Shangri-La	Beautiful hotel in Beijing. Nicely appointed rooms, great bar and lounge. Very nice restaurant. A bit stiff at the front desk and staff though."
32,104,"Feb 23 2007 	Good hotel should be even better once renovation is done	Great hotel. I know it sounds cheesy, but the buffet is great! After spending 1 week in Shanghai prior to coming to Beijing, I was pretty burnt out on Chinese food (cow's face anyone ?). I was very please to come to a GREAT lunch buffet with food from every corner of the globe. Indian, Italian, American, even sushi! And the food was actually quite good. Staff is very friendly, rooms are decent sized. Cleaning staff does good job turning the rooms. Great cigar store in the hotel if you're in the mood for a Cuban."
33,104,"Dec 14 2006	great but watch the location	Got into a wide and beautiful room with lots of light and an unusual lay out for the worktable and the fridge area. Hotel is top fly but I realised I was west of the city when all my biz partners are actually located east of Beijing.the buffet restaurant is one of the best I've been in Asia, service was a little unprofessional at time. Great experience overall."
34,104,"Nov 30 2006 	Excellent in every aspect	It was a pity that my stay in Beijing was only for 2 days as I would have loved to stay longer at the Shangrila Beijing hotel. Upon arrival, I was greeted by name and escorted to my room for a personalised check in. I was upgraded to an executive suite on the 23rd floor. The suite was excellent and consisted of a living room with a good area allocated as a mini business center with a work table, ample electric sockets, free internet conection and a fax / printer machine. There was a guest toilet next to it. Flat screen TV with DVD player and an assortment of audio CDs were kept. The other room was a bedroom with a large king sized bed , a full bathroom with a separate shower and quality toiletries. Service was exemplary and excellent in every aspect. We had breakfast in the restaurant and the choice was enormous with all sorts of dishes from Chinese, Japanese , Malaysian and American cuisines. The horizon club lounge was also accessible for us. It was a bright lounge, very well decorated and on the 21st floor offering sweeping views. From 5-7 pm there was an assortment of hot and cold quality snacks and desserts as well as drinks. My overall impression of the hotel and staff was nothing but excellent. The only drawback is that the hotel is quite far off the city center and bearing in mind the traffic conditions during weekdays, it can take well over an hour to reach downtown if your work requires so."
35,104,"Nov 1 2006 	A Wonderful Hotel	We stayed at this hotel while on a tour of China thru Ritz Tours. We stayed at 5 star hotels all over China and this hotel had the best beds and most comfortable rooms of all. It has a beautiful garden area, wonderful breakfast buffet.I would definitely give it 5 stars."
36,104,"Oct 29 2006 	Absolutely SUPERB!	I used TripAdvisor to do some research in hotels in Beijing before we booked it. Dragonair holidays gave us a choice of 4 and 5 star and after researching, we chose this one.We had been warned it was a bit further out from the city but we had our own driver so it was ok.Hotel was absolutely incredibly beautiful. beautiful tranquil garders and the cuisine was awesome.Try the Shang Palace.. food in there was amazing and at a good price too.The rooms were stunning too.. very well decorated and very clean and modern.Anyone staying in Beijing, I would urge you to consider this one."
37,104,"Oct 10 2006 	I use this hotel as my base in Beijing	I stay here whenever I travel to Beijing, around 5 or 6 times a year.I stay in the Horizon club rooms and the service in the lounge is absolutely fist class, as are the cocktails and canapes on offer every evening.The Horizon Club rooms are no different from the rest of the hotel however, large, comfortable, clean and well serviced. The staff are, without exception, polite and helpful, without being pushy, and I have to mention, especially, Wilsun Arabind the head chef, who has spent time at my table on a number of visits and always offers to make anything I need, whether it's on the menu or not.The quality of the Cafe Cha buffet is, again, first class with a huge and diverse range of dishes on offer, I think there is probably something to suit every taste imaginable. Room service, on the occasions I've used it, has been prompt and efficient.During a visit in 2005 I was suffering from a heavy cold. I was asked by a member of staff in reception if I needed anything but declined, saying I would try to sleep it off. Five minutes after I arived at my room there was a knock on the door, another member of staff with a Chinese cold remedy. Typical of the staff trying to go out of their way to help.One small gripe:The new tower is currently under construction and it can be noisy during the day - but it isn't intrusive enough to make me move."

1,111,Nov 11 2009 	Can't go wrong...	very solid hotel in good location - walking to hi-end shops and close to Tienamen Square. Very safe. Beds a little hard but that is common in China. This place was solid without any real red flags. We got it as part of tour package so not sure of pricing but this is a solid cant go wrong business class hotel that was more than fine for tourists. Comparable to a Four Points or a Courtyard.
2,111,"Nov 9 2009	Classy hotel great value for the money	My son and I spent five nights at the hotel. The hotel has been recently renovated and has been done with quality and attention to detail. The lobby is spacious and classy with comfortable seating. We found the staff at the desk and concierge service very helpful and fluent in English. Some of the staff at the tour information desk could have been more helpful and informed. We had a standard room and found in quite spacious in terms of hotels in China. The room included two sitting chairs plus desk and bar fridge. Linens and towels were spotless. Because of price, we chose to eat a number of our meals across the road from the hotel at a spotless, brightly lit Chinese fast food restaurant. An English menu was provided with a good selection. The service and food quality were excellent, and the prices were very reasonable. The menu did include canned beer .Tinamen square is a brisk half hour walk from the hotel as well, the hotel is close to numerous up scale shops.Since we used taxi service a fair bit, we found it useful at times to stop a taxi a short ways down the street, away from the hotel entrance, as it seemed some taxi drivers quoted higher prices to a destination if they picked you up in front of the hotel.All in all, a very pleasant time in Beijing."
3,111,"Nov 4 2009 	comfortable hotel great location reasonable price	I stayed here with my girlfriend in September 2009. Location was great, near the metro and close to many restaurants. Room was clean and comfortable. I was also able to buy a train ticket to Xi'an here which was great because I initially thought I would have to go to the train station itself to buy the ticket. I recommend this hotel."
4,111,Oct 10 2009 	Great Location	The greatest advantage of this hotel is the location. Close to Wangfujing st; the metro; St. Joseph's Church ( i am catholic); 20 minutes walk to the Forbidden City. There are restaurants and supermarkets right in front of the hotel! Service was good; rooms although a bit small was comfortable. Another plus is some staff speak English!
5,111,Aug 25 2009 	Great place comfortable clean rooms.	I loved this hotel and it's a short walk to Wangfujing street around the corner. Large grocery store across the street. Nice refrigerator with small freezer in the room. 2 free bottles of water every day. Great to watch MTV China in the room also.

7,111,"Jul 9 2009 	Excellent central base in Beijing	This hotel is just off the main shopping street - Wangfujing St - and a 5-10 min walk from the Dengshikou metro line. Can be reached by a combination of train &amp; metro from the airport but easiest to take a taxi - about 100 Yuan (10) including the expressway toll (driver will add the toll on to the amount shown on the meter). Best to print off the name &amp; address in Chinese characters before you go as many taxi drivers do not recognise western characters and speak limited English. The hotel has well-appointed air-conditioned rooms. My bathroom had a large bath-sized shower but no bath, which suited me fine. Free bottles of drinking water are provided from day 2 onwards. There are plenty of resataurants a short walk away from the hotel. The hotel has a bar and two restaurants but prices in these places are normal Western prices - MUCH higher than prices outside the hotel. Easy to get about from here, either by walking, or by using metro or taxis (both very cheap). Would defininitely stay here again on a return visit."
8,111,"Apr 29 2009 	An excellent value	I was very pleased with the Sunworld Hotel (note, it is very close to the Sunworld Dynasty Hotel, but they are two separate hotels).HotelVery professional staff, English was widely spoken.Hotel was clean, comfortable, and staff was knowledgeable about the area.Breakfast was adequate with a mix of European and Chinese.RoomLarge, clean. The room as a little warm, however that may be due to the transition from Winter heat to Summer AirCon (April).Television had international mix of channels with English Language movies and news programs.LocationGreat location very near Wangfujing &quot;walking&quot; street. Plenty to see in the area, walking distance to the Forbidden City and Tianiman Sq.Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby.I would definately stay here again next time I am in Beijing."
9,111,"Apr 22 2009 	Worth its stars	Nice hotel with many able front line staff. Many speak English and be able to provide good info about Beijing. I am impressed with them all. So much so that I have noted most of the staff I have spoken to and will send an email to the management. The location was perfect, quietly off the main shopping and eating streets. There is also underground station within 5 mins walk. On the negative side, the rooms are a touch small and there is no bath. We certainly all OK with this. I don't mind staying there again when we visit beijing next time. Do be put off by its 3/4 stars rating, the hotel standard over there are much higher than anywhere else."
10,111,"Apr 8 2009 	Great Value in Central Beijing. Worth more than 3 Star rating.	My wife and I stayed at the Sunworld Hotel, Beijing 23-24 March 2009. We paid a little extra for an executive room and booked through SinoHotel website. We were very pleased with both the hotel and Sinohotel. The hotel was an ideal location for us. It was a short walk to the main shopping street (Wangfujing Street). Tiananmen and Forbidden City are within reasonable walking distance (Beware if the crowds of tourists in these two places). There is a tour desk in the lobby and we had no problems booking a day tour to The Great Wall including the Ming Tombs as well as a visit to the Chinese Acrobat Show. The hotel room was modern, clean, large and had a nice bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and there was free internet in the room and all the facilities of a modern hotel. In fact it was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed (and we have stayed in many). All of the staff were friendly and helpful and most of them spoke limited English or at least helped us with sign language as we spoke no Chinese. We did not use the restaurant but the menu seemed OK with resonable prices. Across the road is a well stocked supermarket, a nice bakery and Maccas so there is no reason to go hungry. There are plenty of places to eat nearby, especially in Wangfujing street shopping malls."
11,111,"Oct 27 2008 	Good Clean and Reasonably Priced Hotel	Stayed for 5 nites at this hotel on the 10th floor. It's very accessible to Wangfujing shopping areas... about a 10mins or less stroll. The room was clean, bed was comfortable (not hard) and quiet. The hallways did not smell of cigarettes and carpet was clean. Staff spoke simple English and the Concierge was helpful. I would recommend this hotel for the location and the price.Word of caution - Always get the Concierge to get a taxi for you. DO NOT take the taxis that are parked outside the hotel. You'll likely have an unpleasant experience with the driver and get fleeced!"
12,111,"Oct 4 2008 	Sensational sunworld	Slight problem when we arrived as taxi driver took us to the Sunworld Dynasty next door.... but soon rectified, an easy mistake to make. Check in was simple and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Our room was spacious and well appointed and more importantly, spotlessly clean. Many tripadvisor members seem to comment on the hard beds in Chinese hotels but we did not seem to find this a problem. Yes, the beds are firm, but I guess we must be used to it because we slept very well in every hotel we used in China. Sunworld was no exception. The room was quiet, we were never disturbed by other guests banging doors or anything. No complaints whatsoever. We did pop into the restaurant for breakfasy one day and thought 200 CNY for a couple of pieces of toast and 2 coffees was a lot, but maybe they thought we'd had a full breakfast, not worth creating a scene, so we smiled politely and didn't go there again. The hotel is situated just around the corner from Wangfujing Street, literally 5 minutes walk and about 10-15 mins from underground stations, perfect location for sightseeing and transport, taxis always available. Another thing.. every day we acquired another box with a mooncake in it, small ones to start and by the end of our stay, the boxes were getting bigger, they obviously were pleased we were enjoying them!!"
13,111,"Sep 29 2008	Good location	This was a very good hotel, centrally based, and only a short walk from the Forbidden City and excellent shopping area. The food and accomodation were fine, and the staff very pleasant and helpful. Unless you wanted to borrow an umbrella! All the other hotels I stayed at in China had complimentary umbrellas in each room, but for some reason the Sunworld wanted a deposit of 300 Yuan, nearly 30 just to borrow a brolly, which are hardly that expensive in China. Especially when it was a very rainy week, it was a little niggle that was unnecessary, but apart from that nice place to stay."
14,111,Jul 27 2008 	An enjoyable stay	We spent 5 days here and found the service excellent. It was just around the corner from the shopping street Wangfujing and there were plenty of places to eat nearby.It was easy (and cheap) to get taxis to the sights. The hotel had a card with a list of major sights in English and Chinese and all we had to do was show the card to the taxi driver. It made travelling around so easy and comfortable. I noticed that the carpetting in the corridor going to our room was looking a bit worn in places. Otherwise the rooms and the public areas were kept beautifully. There was always someone on duty to help with any requests or problems - and they were very friendly in the way they interacted. In fact the concierge went on the internet to check up on our flight to Mongolia to make sure we got to the airport at the right time.We did eat at the hotel when we were too tired after a long day of sightseeing. The staff showed a keenness to help - even if they found it difficult to understand a word that we said! Note that we found that going for a meal around 9 pm was obviously late for them and they were getting ready to tidy up for the morning. We found that if we did room service breakfast for 1 person we got enough food for the both of us at half the price of breakfast in the restaurant.Please note that the hotel has been renamed Sunworld but the street sign still refers to it as Tianlun Songhe Hotel. There is a Sunworld Dynasty just around the corner and you could end up being taken to the wrong hotel if you are not careful.
15,111,"Jul 17 2008 	Good Hotel in a Very Good Location	It is a very good hotel, clean, and in a good location in Beijing. Is very close to Wangfujing Street (5 minutes walking), Oriental Mall and Tian'anmen (20 min walking).There are 2 hotels very close but difrent: Sunworld Hotel (Sun World) and Sunworld Dinasty Hotel (the last one is opened in July 2008)"
16,111,"Jul 22 2007 	Good value and location	We stayed at this hotel for 10 nights while in Beijing. Room is okay for the price paid. We had a third roll-away bed so room was little tight. Furniture and fixtures were very 80s style. The bathroom is very small.As for location, it is very convenient for tourists who just want to leave the hotel and have plenty of shopping and restuarants available by walking. Right across the street is a restaurant where we ate quite a few times. They serve good Chinese style breakfast and lunch and dinner meals are relatively cheap (one person about $2-$4 US).If you are looking for value and location, this would definitely fit the bill. If you're looking for a nicer room, might have to try Crown Plaza or Wangfujing Hotel nearby."
17,111,"Jun 27 2007 	Very valued hotel in Beijing	It's a really budgeted hotel in Beijing. I stayed there for 4 nights with my fiance, and the rooms are clean, staffs are nice. Location is 10-15 mins walk to WangFuZhin Street. Personally felt quite far away...but price was valued. Recommended for budgeted travelers~"
18,111,"Dec 17 2006 	Great Location and Roomy	We stayed here for 5 nights. The room is quite big, with 2 Queen size bed and very clean. It was a little dark though.It was my kids' 1st trip to China and they were comfortable and settled down well. Did as what the other reviewers said, avoided the hotel cuisine.For breakfast, go to the opposite. head for the corner shop with the red signboard, it's on your right.The short-ribs or beef noodles/ flat rice noodle is nice, cheap and big servings.Within walking distance to the main Wangfujing shopping street."
19,111,"Nov 10 2006 	Hotel	This Hotel is fantastic! We stayed for 9 nights in Oct 06. Although rooms a little dated, but very clean and well appointed! The front office staff are very helpful and friendly. It was great when catching a taxi as they would make sure the drivers knew where you wanted to go and also wrote the taxi number down for us if there was a problem, also when we returned to the hotel, they would also give you the taxi number.The coffee shop was suitable for a snack, we did not dine in the hotel.The only draw back was the dreadful internet service in the business centre.....The positon of the Hotel was great..... lots of restaurants close by."
20,111,"Nov 1 2006 	Very good value	I chose this hotel mostly based on reviews I read here and for the most part can echo what has already been said. The Songhe is a reasonably priced 3 star option (~$70) two minutes from Wangfujing Street. By no means do I consider myself an expert on Beijing but from research and limited experience this seems to be the best area to stay. Better not underestimate the walking distance down the street towards the main road and Tiananmen Square, especially as you are likely to cover it more then once in both direction. Also, prepare for a challenge when trying to communicate with the hotel staff, as English is not among their strongest skills. Other than that  great value. Do not expect anything fancy, but it does the job. Theres a supermarket across the street and to the right which is very convenient."
21,111,"Oct 25 2006	nice standard place to stay	I'd agree with the other reviews that the hotel is a nice, standard place to stay in Beijing. The location is good... Very near the centre. I'd recommend walking to the tourist places in the centre and not bother with taxis. Defiantely don't use taxis that sit in the street outside the hotel. They seemed to want to try every trick in the book to rip us off. We approached one licensed taxi outside the hotel who said he couldn't take us. Instead he told us to get into his friend's taxi which turned out to be unlicensed and we were charged more than 3 times the amount the journey should have cost.I thought the main restaurant in the hotel was good. Its on the 1st floor (ground floor if you're English). Go down the right hand corridor as you come in from the front door and its the restaurant on the left. One night we had pigeon. When it arrived it still had its head on, and it seemed to be looking at me. It tasted nice though."
22,111,"Oct 14 2006 	Excellent location	The hotel is excellent located centrally in Bejing minutes from the &quot;golden street&quot; / &quot;silver street&quot; shopping areas.Rooms were good sized and bathrooms good.Breakfast was also good, loved the dumplings and omelette.The only negative we could find was that not all taxi drivers knew the location of the hotel (even with an adress written in chinese).A recomandation would be to get the names/adress of the bigger hotels in the same street and ask the taxi driver to go there and walk the 2min to the hotel.An excellent supermarket for water/ice tee and everything you could need is located across the road and to the right.It is in a basement, so the entrance feels a bit weird, but it is a large chinese supermarket, with low prices. There is also a supermarket in a shopping senter to the left, but that is rather pricy compared to the other.We never had lunch/dinner at the hotel, so we can not comment on the buffet."
23,111,"Sep 20 2006	Good central location for reasonable price	We have just returned from 9 nights at this hotel in Sept. 06. Previous reviews are all fair, and prices quoted for meals, taxis etc. are up to date and description of hotel pretty good so I will try not to repeat.The hotel is in a very good location. If you think 3 star you will not be disappointed. You can hear the person snoring next door in some rooms because of the locked connecting door, our room did need a new carpet. After one or two meals in the hotel, they are repetitive - even a buffet - and so you are better eating out, and staying on a no breakfast deal.I did not fancy the fast food restaurent opposite that other people reccomend. We preferred to turn right on leaving hotel, walk for approx 100m and eat at the restaurent with the white table cloths, the one next door is cheaper - no table cloths - but pay the extra. An evening meal for four adults with all the dishes you can eat, plus drinks was under 15.00 total for four.Also eat at S.Silk Road on Lotus Lane in the evening. It is busy at 5.30 ish and you ,may have to wait for a table indoors. But wait.The bread/cake shop opposite the hotel is a delight.Taxis are cheap, whether the one at the hotel or hailed from the street.Silk Market and the Antiques market - it sells more than antiques - are the best. Have a suit made to measure at the Silk Market as soon as you arrive. Pay approx. 1000 yuan, say 70.00 for a cashmere/ wool suit with an additional pair of trousers. This is with their best material. You can get it lower, but I wanted to be sure it was made on time.Get prescription glasses, variable focus with titanium frames for about 40.00 at the Silk Market.Have a foot massage at the Silk Market, far cheaper than near the hotel.Give the Friendship store a miss, hardly anybody there, and nobody buying.Concierge in the hotel very helpful.Make sure you get the Chinese name for the hotel printed befor you leave home. Find a website with it on - I used the old Novotel site, bit it worked.It is a good 3 star, arguably 4. But think 3.Hotels nearby Tianlun and Crown Plaza are more exclusive but more pricey. Not worth the difference unless it is a special anniversary etc.I would stay again at this hotel, am well travelled, and would reccomend it due to location, price and cleanliness. But think 3 star not 4!"
24,111,"Jun 29 2006 	A good deal	I stayed in the Tianlun Songhe Hotel for 5 days for a business meeting. My room was paid by my host so I don't know how much they paid for it, but it struck me as a good 3.5* to 4* hotel. If anything it was a more chinese version of the western chains which otherwise abound in this area.The location is ideal, steps aways from shopping and 10 minutes walk from Tiananmen.Staff throughout the hotel were courteous, attentive and responsive. Any issues I had were dealt with promptly and efficiently.I found the room I had was very spacious, reasonably, but not luxoriously equipped. The room was kept nicely clean, as was the bathroom. Nice big TV set, only English news was CNN, no BBC. The BBC website was also censored and not available over the Internet.Internet access in the rooms was through a power line modem (and didn't use a USB port as claimed by the hotel instructions). You simply connected it straight to your Ethernet port. Had to pay a CNY 500 refundable deposit for the modem.The buffet restaurant was OK, but certainly nothing to write home about and the food was always the same. One previous reviewer complained about the food not being hot - that is normal. In China, food is nearly always served lukewarm. That of course, doesn't mean it hasn't been cooked, only that it is served that way.I would certainly recommend the hotel for its location and pleasant staff."
25,111,"May 15 2006	Nice and simple	Background: 5 days in Beijing after having spent 3 days in Xi'an. Wife and I are in our 30's. We speak and read Mandarin. First trip to Beijing. Looking for a functional but comfortable hotel. We aren't used to having our rooms cleaned for us, and weren't expecting to have hotel restaurant food, room service, or even to have organised tours. We had the hotel name printed out earler. The taxi from Beijing West train station had no problems findng the hotel. Although he did have to make a U-turn in a narrow road -- not sure why. We were worried that it was a smalllish hotel, compared to Tianlun Dynasty and Crowne Plaza, both 100m away on the same road. Reception was a little slow and chilly, both on checking in and checking out. Maybe it was understaffed during those times. Language skills were useful: we witnessed other tourists having difficulties when their requests went beyond &quot;checkin/checkout&quot;. Functional, though. During our stay, we later came down to chat about the available tours (we didn't take any in the end), and to set up Internet in our room, and they were helpful then. They accepted the usual credit cards, including Diners. The room we got was also functional. Small/medium: TV, remote, armchair, 2 single beds, sidetable in between, minibar, cool/hot water dispenser (boils on request I think), desk with lots of drawers, luggage rack, cupboard, safe. Toilet, sink, shower in bathtub blah. Blockout curtains. There's a locked door connecting to the neighbour's room. No problems with smells, or ventilation. Outside the window was construction, but no sound. Not sure why. There aren't as many trees around the building as seems to be on the photos. It's not extravagant. Everything wooden (i.e. door, cupboard, desks) looked a little &quot;80's&quot; and shabby. All dark wood too: When the curtains were closed (at night) the room became quite dark even with the lights on, making it difficult to read/write at the desk. Since there were 2 of us, the armchair with footrest was nice, while we took turns to use the desk. There were powerplugs of all sorts on the walls -- British, Australian, and US ones. Although they did need 3 prongs for the Australian plugs. One evening, we could hear the male neighbour singing, through the thin wall/locked door, which worried us. Thank goodness that lasted only a couple of hours. Bonus: there was a notice on the desk that said we could rent from reception a USB appliance that attached to the powerplug that would also provide Internet in the room. There was a 500Y refundable guarantee fee, and a 50Y/daily fee. This was not advertised when we made our booking, and if it was USB, it was unlikely that we would have network drivers for my Mac OS X PowerBook. Turns our that 1. the daily fee was already included in our room rates, 2. it was ethernet to power, not USB. 3. included in the bundle was a power extension cable with additional sockets. We had to pay the 500Y, which was OK, and refunded at the end. Worked with my PowerBook without drivers. Excellent! We got to read Tripadvisor etc to plan our days, send/receive emails, and upload photos every evening etc. We weren't too interested in taking organised group tours, but sought a car to Mutianyu Great Wall. There is a travel counter at the hotel which would organise a private tour in a deluxe car for 700Y (they have a printed price list for many locations). We went out instead, and organised a trip with a normal Beijing cab for 500Y (to/fro, and wait for us at the wall). The hotel would organise a rented car to/fro Simatai for us for &gt; 1000Y. The printed prices seemed a little high, and we didn't try to haggle. The hotel location is good. Wangfujin shopping didn't appeal to use much, but we did take a peek. It's there and we budgeted some time to look around, but never properly made it. Within walking distance are: Wangfujin Bookstore, Wangfujin food lane, Donghuamen food street, Forbidden City/Tiananmen/Beihai area. Quanjunde Beijing Roast duck has a branch along Wangfujin closeby -- went there twice. Oriental Plaza (where Hyatt is), has lots of franchise food shops that are nice, yet not pricey (by foreigners standards). A meal was usually 30-40Y for 2 of us. We ate at different shops a lot. The subway station is about 10-15 minutes down Wangfujin Street (between Oriental Plaza, and Beijing Hotel) -- probably a third or a quarter the distance to actual Tiananmen Square itself. I *estimate* that the Square is about 2.5km from the hotel, so it's not just next door. Food was not included in our hotel rates, and we weren't too interested in the idea. Opposite the hotel is a franchise modern-type Chinese restaurant. Funnily the morning and evening service is totally different. Including staff uniforms, food types, and method of ordering food. There are menus with pictures on them in the afternoon/evening only. Morning seems a little more fast paced, and we order/pay at a counter, then collect at a 2nd counter. Tricky, but we watched others, and everything turned out ok. It's good and cheap enought that we could've gone there everyday. There's also a McDonalds 100m away that opens at 7am, and a supermarket right next to that too (look for a sign and an arrow painted on the wall). On our last day, we suddenly realised that we could've had Mongolian hotpot right at the hotel restaurant, and not too pricey too. Made our mouths water, but too late: we were leaving. We would probably have gone for another round of Quanjunde Beijing Duck (it's that good). We had our room cleaned every other day (i.e. twice in total). No problems there, but we did put the 12&quot; G4 PowerBook in the roomsafe. Anything larger wouldn't have fit IMHO. Lots of legal 1.60Y cabs on the street outside the hotel, when we made trips to Summer Palace (50Y) and Airport (about 100Y, can't remember). We didn't bother asking the hotel staff to hail us one. There was also a bus stop about 10m away from the hotel, which maybe we could have tried to use, but didn't. We paid 578Y for a &quot;deluxe standard room&quot;, on Asiatravel -- just about the upper limit of what we wanted to pay. The picture there is accurate, although in reality, things are darker and there is no rose in the bed. I'd recommend the hotel to my friends, if they aren't looking for too many amenities. I'd stay there again, but only after some price hunting. The location, and unadvertised internet-in-room is a major bonus."
26,111,"Apr 10 2006	Reasonable priced accomodation in convenient location	My husband and I stayed at the TianLun SongHe for 5 nights last week. We paid RMB538 each night. The hotel was quite old and furniture in the room had seen better days. The room was of reasonable size but the bathroom was small. I found the bed very hard and had trouble sleeping the first night but my husband was ok. I think, most importantly, the room was clean. We liked the water-dispenser (hot/cold) and it gets refilled everyday.SongHe enjoys a great location just off WangFuJing. When you come out from the hotel &amp; turn left, you will find WangFuJing (pedestrian street). To the right, you will find many food outlets (mainly Shanghainese/Taiwanese type plus a MacDonald's). At right end, you will find another main street (DongSi meaning East Four) which houses boutiques/salons/more eateries. Not many tourists in this part. Hence, the stuff they sell is different from WangFuJing which has all the malls, fastfood and the bigger brands. But for bargain hunting, I think nothing beats Silk Street market. Lots of fake LVs, Pradas, Gucci and Polo Ralph Lauren shirts. Also good for children's clothes. Be prepared to bargain though - we always walked off and got called back :PHotels in the vicinity:Next door, also a TianLun hotel but the TianLun Dynasty. I think you will need to pay RMB 700-800 'cos it's newer and more luxurious. Opposite the TianLun Dynasty is the Holiday Crowne Plaza which is another new/luxurious hotel. About 2 blocks down, there is the Taiwan hotel, Novotel Peace and a Lee Garden apartment. All in very convenient locations just off WangFuJing pedestrian street. But depending on the class of hotel, the price of local tour packages may also be different. I paid RMB300 for a one-day tour to Badaling and SiSanLing while tour-mates staying at TianLun Dynasty paid RMB320. The really grand hotels like Grand Hyatt, Beijing Hotel, are at the southern end of WangFuJing and sits on top of the subway. At the northern end is the Prime Hotel which is a little way off."
27,111,"Mar 9 2006	Pros and cons of Tianlun Songhe hotel...	My partner and I stayed at the Tianlun Songhe Hotel in Beijing for seven nights from 3/1/06-3/8/06. We chose this hotel based on the location and the reviews we had read. As many people have said, the hotel is in an excellent location and is just around the corner from Wangfujing, a major &quot;shopping street.&quot; Upon our arrival to the hotel, we were immediately checked in and given a room on the 10th floor. The rooms are of average size and not small like some people have reported. The room was clean and featured a water dispenser which we did not use, a mini-refrigerator stocked with some food/drinks, a color tv which featured about 60 stations including CNN, HBO and CCTV, and controls between the beds for the tv and individual lights for the bed, a very nice touch. On top of the stand between the beds were &quot;adult supplies&quot; such as condoms, etc. There were also overpriced snacks in the room which were for sale but many of them were outdated. There were also two pairs of slippers in addition to phone books.The bathroom was of average size and featured more things you could purchase such as a razor, salts for baths, lotions, etc. The free items in the bathroom were combs, shampoo and soap. There were two bathrobes hanging on the door but we never used them and they were removed from the room after the first day. The bathroom was clean and the water pressure was FANTASTIC! The towels were nice, thick and absorbent and were restocked every day.When we entered the room we noticed that it was very warm. So, we attempted to turn on the air conditioner. Unfortunately, it only emitted warm air and the windows in the room were sealed shut. So, we just turned off the heater all together and never used it during our entire stay. This was really our only complaint about the room. Oh, yeah, the room also featured a comfortable chair with a foot stool in addition to a desk and chair.My partner loves buffets and on the third night we ate in the hotel's buffet restaurant on the second floor. As I began to walk around and look at the dishes offered, I must say that I was not impressed. To make a long story short, I ended up getting food poisoning and was vomiting approximately one hour later. The food in the hotel's buffet is not properly heated and none of the food I put on my plate was warm. While I'm not really picky about buffets, the food in this restaurant was simply not good and because I ended up getting sick, I would not recommend that you eat in the hotel's buffet, or any hotel's buffet for that manner. When the heat for the trays is not properly maintained, bacteria will rapidly spread. Be very careful if you decide to eat there. We did not eat in any of the other restaurants in the hotel for fear of getting sick again. However, throughout our stay at the hotel, there seemed to be plenty of hotel guests eating at the buffet. I hope they had better luck than I did.The hotel also advertises that it has internet access in the rooms, but you have to &quot;sign up&quot; to be able to use the hotel's modem, and the charge is simply a rip-off. We attempted to use the computers in the hotel's business center, but their computers are outdated and we weren't even able to sign onto AOL to check our e-mail. The woman working in the business center was very gracious and kind. There is an internet cafe located close to the hotel. When you exit the hotel, turn to the right until you get to the first major street. From there, turn to the left and walk for approximately 2-3 minutes on the left side of the road. Look inside the businesses as you walk past them and you'll eventually see a coffee bar which has a lot of computers set up. It is sort of difficult to see and we walked right past it a couple of times. For 12 yuan, or approximately $1.50, you get a nice cup of real Colombian coffee and an hour on the internet, not such a bad deal. The woman working in the cafe is very nice. Directly across the street from the hotel is a Chinese fast food chain restaurant that is quite good. If you go in for breakfast, proceed to the counter to order and pay for your food. Once you have done so, you take the receipt to another part of the counter to pick up your food. If you go there for lunch or dinner, you'll be seated immediately and then presented with a picture menu. The waitress will write down your order, take your money, and then bring your change and receipt a few minutes later. A meal for two at this restaurant only cost about $3-4, a GREAT deal! We highly recommend the pork-filled sandwiches in clay oven baked bread, and the grilled dumplings for breakfast...all super cheap! When you exit the hotel and walk to the right, you'll find another Chinese fast food restaurant which was also quite good. Here the wait staff at the register will give you an English menu to look at and are very helpful in helping you figure out what you want. The food here was also super cheap and very good. Unlike the other restaurant directly across from the hotel, this one features a western-style breakfast. The fried rice and sausage was quite good. They also have fried eggs.The people working the concierge desk at the hotel were very helpful and always there to answer your questions. If you ask them for a taxi, though, they will most definitely put you in the most expensive one. There were almost always taxis sitting in front of the hotel next to the street, but be sure to say &quot;meter&quot; before getting in to make sure that they will turn it on. Don't get in until you are sure they are using a meter. We had the hotel book us a taxi for our trip to the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall and it cost us 500 yuan, or about $62. It was well worth it. The concierge person said that was the going rate but one might be able to make the trip via taxi for a cheaper price should you search out a taxi on your own. Whatever you do, don't pay more than 500 yuan for a 6-8 hour rental.The taxi drivers do not speak English so as you're on your way out of the hotel, stop by the concierge desk, tell them where you want to go, and they'll give you a card with the destination written in Chinese. Do not get into any taxis if they do not have a price sticker in one of the windows. Those without stickers are most likely unofficial taxis and you'll probably end up getting ripped off.Across the street from the hotel and a bit to the left is a place to get a foot massage. It cost 128 yuan per person, approximately $16, for about 80-90 minutes and it was well worth it. They'll massage your feet in ways that you never thought imaginable.The hotel apparently has a recreation room but we never had any interest in looking for it. So, in the end, would we stay at the Tianlun Songhe Hotel again? Yes! Would we recommend it to others? Yes! If you're looking for luxury, then look elsewhere. If you're looking for a clean, adequate hotel in a great location, then the Tianlun Songhe Hotel fits the bill! Our trip to Beijing was AWESOME and we look forward to visiting China again someday! Have a great time!"
28,111,"Feb 22 2006	Great Location. Great Value.	I took my daughter to Beijing for her first trip to China and we stayed here. It turned out to be a great choice. It was comfortable enough to please her and helped make her trip less overwhelming.The rooms where OK, spacious enough, but certainly not luxuriously appointed.The breakfast buffet was fine, nothing to boast about, but always the hardest meal for Americans to find.The location was great. Steps to Wangfujing. Just a short walk to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Sq. Centrally located to anywhere we wanted to go.I would certainly recommend the Songhe to anyone travelling to Beijing."
29,111,"Feb 2 2006	Great value!	We chose this hotel based on location and price. It turned out to be a great choice! Indeed, the location is excellent. The only downside is that there is no subway station particularly nearby (the nearest is perhaps a 10 minute walk down Wangfujing) and at times taxi rides, although fantastically cheap, can take a while in the traffic chaos. This was, however, a minor problem.We were put in a twin room on the top floor, which is a non-smoking floor. On nice days, when pollution did not spoil our view, we had a view of the Forbidden City from our window.Although the rooms are basic and a bit worn, they are just what you need and are kept very clean. Don't know what the policy about throwing towels in a basket if you wanted new ones was about, as they changed all towels daily anyway. Funny that the covering plastic was kept on all lamp shades as well. The English language TV channels we found were HBO and CNN, but I believe there were local news (censored, of course) in English on some of the Chinese channels.We chose to book through an agency that had breakfast included in the price. The big booking engines don't have this included in their prices. We never tried the breakfast in the Chinese restaurant, but only ate in the Russian (!) restaurant. It should be stressed that nothing Russian was found over that breakfast, but it is rather a good, international breakfast.Staff were courteous and helpful. Whether people accept tips or not varies in China (it is in fact illegal to accept), and we learnt that it is not accepted by staff at Songhe.We never tried the hotel restaurants except for breakfast. There are, however, brilliant restaurants nearby. The restaurant just next to the hotel entrance, with lion statues guarding the restaurant entrance, should, however be avoided. It is expensive and the food is not particulaly good either. If you ever get tired of Chinese food while staying there, there are McDonald's, Pizza Haven and KFC very nearby (all three at silly low prices).Our best restaurant recommendation is not far away. As you leave the hotel, turn left, cross Wanfujing and countinue until the very end of this street (i.e. the street on which the hotel is located). Cross the traffic islands and turn right. Continue past a Japanese restaurant and you will find a brilliant restaurant on the next corner. Looks luxurious, but is cheap and serves great food.All in all, Tianlun Songhe Hotel is an excellent choice for people who want a good, well-located hotel, but do not require the luxury and amenities of more than a 3-star hotel."
30,111,"Jan 29 2006	A Good Choice	The Songhe is a good priced hotel in a good location to see the sights of Beijing. We were able to walk to many of the places we wanted to see in the city center and for the further sights the taxi rides were cheap. The staff was fun to deal with and extremely helpful for tours, money matters, electrical adaptors, tourist information and train/hotel reservations. Clean with good maid and room service, we had no complaints about our stay there. Loved the breakfast. Especially liked the service of the front door staff who went the extra mile helping with taxi services. We stayed here again on our swing though Beijing when we were leaving China. The Hotel gave us a last good impression of a wonderful country."
31,111,"Jul 18 2005	Song He Beijing	We stayed twice at the Song He and would recommend it. The rooms, although not terribly spacious, were very clean and bathrooms immaculate.Breakfast buffet was excellent, with extraordinary choices. Good central location and pleasant informative staff."
32,111,"Oct 12 2004	Good Location	The hotel room was basic but very big and comfortable. The room had a TV (with English channels), safe, minibar, and hairdryer. The staff are all very helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a great location just off the main shopping street Wanfujing and about 15mins walk to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square."
1,117,Great Stay for parents wife and the kids	Had two interconnecting rooms over 4 nights. Lovely hotel in great location.Rooms very smart and well appointed. The room was serviced twice a day.Lobby very impressive however the shops on the lobby and two basements floors are very niche / expensive.Breakfast was very very good and restaurant nicely decorated. Fortunately included in our package else its about RMB240 each.Had dinner in same restaurant however that was very average with a limited menu selection I felt.Swimming pool lovely and always empty. Temp nice and warm and plenty of towels etc provided on all the chairs.Good Wi Fi coverage in both the rooms - Complimentary - Wish more hotels did this.
2,117,"Luxurious with a great value!!	I stayed at The Peninsula with my classmates for sightseeing around Beijing. The location is amazing if you are looking for night markets that are just around the corners or fastfood places like Mcdonalds and KFC. Great window shopping by the international brands boutiques in the hotel lobby, and AMAZING breakfast !! Hotel staff are all good english speakers (which is very rare in Beijing) and are very friendly. A lot of personal touches like notes left in the room from the hotel, and even a complimentary cake for anyone celebrating their birthday while their stay at The Peninsula... I would reccomend this hotel to anyone who is looking for an amazing time at Beijing !!"
3,117,"Nov 23 2009 	What you would expect	Stayed here for 3 nights - What you would expect from a 5* hotel, but nothing special.Location is as good as anywhere in Beijing. The City is enormous so not matter where you stay some attractions are going to be far away. This close to Forbidden City though, and some good shopping nearby.Hotel itself is nice. Lobby bar a little disappointing, seems like something of an afterthought. Prices are steep for Beijing, though service is on the whole very good. The breakfast buffet downstairs in their restaurant was good; didn't eat there for any other meals so can't speak for the other 2 Chinese places.Rooms were very nice. Big flatscreen, dvd player. Lots of plugs, including a UK 3 pin plus which was a nice touch. Bed very comfy, though pillows a little soft for me. Great bathroom with plenty of room, decent shower. TV a nice touch but fairly pointless.Overall a very fine hotel and we got a great deal which made it even better. Service is up there with the best. So you get exactly what you pay for."
4,117,"Nov 23 2009 	Non-smokers hate	I know mainland still has people with bad habits, but i didn't expect people to smoke in a non-smoking floor. Even after complaining to management, nothing was done clearly to correct this issue. Not to blame the hotel management, but more of the citizens and travelers in China. Overall great service in hotel, they treat you like KINGS in the pool and fitness area. Their Chinese restaurant located at the atrium of the hotel is superb."
5,117,"Nov 21 2009 	Now know the meaning of excellent service	Returned yesterday from a 5 night stay at the Peninsula. If you don't mind going to Beijing in the cold weather (40s F this week), grab the fabulous winter package the Peninsula offers on their website for under $200 US per night. We arrived at the airport from the US at 1030 pm to have a Peninsula limo waiting for us as part of the hotel package. The driver called the hotel a minute or two prior to our arrival and no less than 5 hotel personnel were waiting, bags whisked away and the check in clerk guided us to effortless check in and up to our room, coinciding with room service bringing us a welcoming tray of hot chocolate and cookies. The absolutely fabulous breakfast buffet is included in the rate and it was a wonderful way to start each day. They even open at 530 am, which allowed us breakfast prior to our 615 am checkout. The room was lovely and absolutely no complaints as we do not have a problem with firm mattresses. Room service was efficient and the highly rated Chinese restaurant in the hotel was excellent.As to location, it is perfect. A huge pedestrian street is the second block to the left of the hotel and from the end of that it is a 10 minute or so walk to the Forbidden City. CITS travel service is in the building to the right of the hotel and we arranged a tour to the Great Wall at Mutianyu with them. But, the mandatory stops at the jade showroom and silk showrooms ruined the day for us and I would advise hiring your own driver so that you can set your own itinerary. We used the subway system, which was easy to navigate and taxis, when you can find a metered one, were cheap. But, getting back to the Peninsula, It is the first time I can say it was a perfect stay at a perfect hotel."
6,117,"Nov 14 2009 	Perfectly adequate	The colour scheme of the room is a little bit drab in grey and business like but everything worked well. The bed was hard, as are all the beds in China, but they tried their best when I complained and bought in an inch thick mattress topper which slightly helped. There was a nice large flat screen TV and a DVD player that played region 2 (European) DVDs. The view was uninspiring and looked straight into the building opposite. The bathroom was on the small side but was well lit and had a vanity mirror and a good hair dryer. The bath had a shower over the top. One interesting gadget was a useful display which told you the temperature outside. There was a decent sized safe. Breakfast was good, with a good range of things on offer. They charged for internet access which was annoying given that I only needed a little time to check e-mails. When my guide didnt arrive to take me to the airport for my onward bound flight to Xian they were able to quickly get me a taxi at 6.40am and it only cost me ten pounds. They had quoted me considerably more when I enquired about day trips to the Forbidden City and the Great Wall (about 250 pounds for the day which I felt was excessive and so didnt book). The main shopping street is very near by as is a little supermarket where the till assistant spoke good English! Also the dumpling restaurant street Jingli something or other is walking distance too."
7,117,"Nov 1 2009 	Best area	The Peninsula is located near the Forbidden City, a pedestrian mall and a subway stop. Although it is expensive, the service and rooms are top notch. The Hilton is only a block and a half away and offers the same perks at a lower price."
8,117,"Oct 27 2009 	The Finest 5 Star Hotel in Beijing	This was my 5th stay at the Peninsula in Beijing. The service as always was excellent. Large King Size Suite, fresh fruit everyday placed in room. Room serviced on time everyday. The food at this hotel is excellent at breakfast, lunch or dinner. The front desk as well as the Concierge was all at the top of their game. I plan to stay there in 2010 when I return with a new and repeat group of friends. I booked a regular King room and used my Platinum American Express for the free up-grade.haroldsargent USA"
9,117,"Oct 26 2009 	Brilliant hotel	Stayed in Oct 2009 in a Grand Deluxe Room (1850RMB). Fab location, fantastic and faultless service. Room is not huge but high quality fixtures and fittings. Super shower, great gym. Nothing was too much trouble with the staff. Cards with each restaurant that they have booked for me was handed over by the Concierge with distance and names/address in Chinese - now that's what I call special service. On Beijing - friendly people, but do watch out for occassional spitting on the street and lots of people braging in queues. Taxis are very cheap although driving standards can be scary, and traffic can be heavy. Recommended restaraunts are:-Da Dong Beijing Duck (the best Chinese in town)Maison Buloud (the best French in town)Huang TingCrystal JadeMy Humble HouseMade in ChinaBut avoid Whampo House in the Financial District.See Forbidden City, Great Wall, Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven, Legation Quarter, hutongs, CCTV building and Olympic village. For more tips, see the section listed under Beijing."
10,117,"Oct 24 2009 	Great service but there are better value out there	The Peninsula is one of the old grand hotels in Beijing, and it shows. But the hotel staff is perhaps the most friendly and professional in town. The food is absolutely tops. If you don't mind paying more for these while getting a not so special and smallish room for your money, then it is highly recommended."
11,117,Oct 24 2009 	fantastic	Great hotel and great service. Was very tired after the long flight from Florida. Had the hotel limo pick us up. Was a great idea as you can feel very overwhelmed when getting off the plane. Room was comfortable and decorated with taste. Had a nice nap and when we woke up went to the restaurant where we had a great dinner. Atmosphere was lovely and tranquil. Location was also great. Have nothing negative to say about the hotel
12,117,"Oct 13 2009 	Stunning Hotel with World Class Service!	My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Peninsula on the first few days of our honeymoon in China. I have to say this is the best place I have ever stayed, we were upgraded to a superior deluxe room on arrival as we were on our honeymoon.The room and all the hotel facilities were just perfect. The staff and their attention to detail were absolutely amazing. On our return to the hotel for the final part of our holiday we were greeted with a 'welcome back' gesture of wine and cake and personalised note from the manager. You just don't get this level of service anywhere else.I would definitely reccomend this hotel and hope to return again. Enjoy!!! PS.Great Location, literally 5 mins and you are in the main shopping area."
13,117,"Oct 7 2009 	Excellent Service and Location	I booked 2 rooms for 5 nites from 18.9.09-23.9.2009 and requested for connecting rooms which were granted upon arrival. Check in was smooth, the rooms were clean with sufficient space, personal fax and complimentary free internet service. When my sister fell ill one night, we called the hotel staff for an ambulance which they arranged with speed to take her to the best hospital in Beijing, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (International Medical Services) and assured us of the same. The management and staff had helped us tremendously throughout our ordeal, keeping in close contact with the hospital on my sister's wellbeing, preparing breakfast takeaway every morning to hospital and offering us all the assistance needed. Perhaps their fast efficient and timely action had saved my sister's life. Location of the Peninsula is excellent. It is near the Wangfujing walking street, night market and you could even walk to have the peking duck at Da Dong Roast Duck Restaurant at Jing Bao Tower. At the exit of the hotel just turn right and at the end of the road turn right again. If I ever return to Beijing, I would not hesitate to stay at the Peninsula again. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Peninsula for all the assistance, patience and caring rendered during our stay there."
14,117,"Oct 4 2009 	Excellent hotel - great location	We stayed for 5 nights in a Club Deluxe Room which meant that you could enjoy the facilities offered in the Club Lounge which when we tallied it up provided us with value for money and we met other club members and enjoyed drinks and food in quiet comfort.Room was very functional - little small but fine. Bed was great and large. Internet complimentary and worked well. Bathroom great [but shower over bath though]. Club Lounge provided substantial breakfasts that got us through to lunch time and they provided free bottle water which we took on our daily sightseeing walks. You can ask for extras and they will provideHad lunch in Hotel Chinese restaurant once - expensive for what you get.Best Peking Duck is Da Dong [taxi ride from hotel]. Look it up on internet - excellent duck, Chinese food and service [English waitress available to assist and to call for taxi after]. Will definitely return to there.If it is to far to walk to daily destinations - take taxis [cheap as chips]. Concierge will give you a &quot;take me to ...&quot; card which you can show to taxi drivers. Excellent - as for one its free.Silk Market is great for shopping - &quot;yes&quot; you will probably pay too much as most of us are not used to their aggressive selling [theatrical really]. But if you like what you see and it is far cheaper than what you would pay in your home country price and - then be happy. with the price even if someone tells you that you could have paid less. Offer them the lowest price to start with as you will work the price up but not down. Best advice - decide on your top price in your mind and if it reaches that then walk away and keep on walking most of the time they will chase you to say 'ok' and then tell you that they are doing you a favour - just smile and give them the money. If they dont you will probably see the item in another stall. Will definitely return to The Penisula Beijing as it met all of our expectations and more. Beijing is a great city to visit for culture/sightseeing and shopping."
15,117,"Sep 17 2009 	Only perfection	This is absolutely the best city hotel I ever been in many ways. Perfect service, friendly staff, while still being relaxed. No is not an option for anyting. Check in was extremely fast, breakfast and dinner were stunnig. Very nice decorated room, with a tv at the end of the bath. Rooms were good size. Location is great, forbidden city and a luxury shopping area within walking distance. Really enjoyed this hotel and it is very hard to find any faults."
16,117,"Sep 16 2009 	Writing from the hotel room now...	As I type this in the hotel room, I would like to explain that I am not accustomed to such luxury. To me it is luxury, to others is it not.---I am staying at this hotel for about 2 weeks. For the past 3 years I have been coming to Beijing, to see family. Although smoggy with disastrous traffic, I love this city.I entered the hotel with my cousin via taxi. There are two doormen whose job is to push the rotating door for you.That was strange...but awesome.The street level floor has reception and the bar. On either side of the floor is Chanel and Louis Vuitton. On the two bottom floors there are more designer stores like Armani. The reception staff was very nice and they spoke English very well. Of course if you cannot understand English with a Chinese accent, you are doomed.Their accents were not too bad, but I am used to it.If there is something mundane that a hotel traveler is used to and their is a staff person close, they will usually do it for you.Example, a receptionist pushed the up button for my cousin and I, when we were going towards the elevator. The bellhops bring your bags to the door. Mine were 2 heavy duffel bags, so they brought two people.The hotel is located 1 block or so from Wangfujing street, a popular tourist spot that has everything you might need. Immediately around the corner there is a market where you can buy water, snacks and shampoo. I recommend not drinking the tap water if you have a sensitive stomach or if you are not from China. It can easily upset your stomach. Boiling the water is fine though.---Still trying to recover from jetlag, I caved and ordered the Chinese breakfast room service.Also, I do not know what &quot;business casual&quot; actually is for the restaurants...haha.For 24 USD, it is quite a helping of food.Congee (rice soup), fresh fruit, fresh juice, chinese pickles, tea, dimsum and noodles.They even had little mini char siu bao!It was very good, although not as good as homecooked.I decided to head to the pool before my spa treatment.You sign in with your room number. If needed you can have a locker key to keep your things in. I was not sure how to dress when going down to the pool, so I just wore my clothes.Inside the locker they give you a towel, a bathrobe, poolside slippers and a few coat hangers.Before you enter the pool, you must walk through ankle deep water to clean your feet.A woman is inside the pool area to assist you. When you enter she lays out towels on a sun-chair, gives you a bottle of water and a magazine. There are also goggles if you need them.She spoke enough English to communicate the needs.The pool was a little cold, I will admit. Then again it IS 84 degrees outside....Although I do not know if it her job, I assume it is, she turns on the shower for you and dries your bathing siut too. I am used to using the bathing suit dryers myself, so I assumed the patron did it. But she said no no and dried the other half of my suit.--- If you stayed with me through this whole review, congrats!But joking aside, I really do like this place.If you are a business person or are used to total luxury hotels, this might not be for you.I am the kind of person who does not need an extra sitting room."
17,117,"Aug 27 2009 	Recommended but doesn't quite live up to the Peninsula Standard	We stayed at the Peninsula Bejing for 6 nights in a Grand Delux Room. We had two reasons for choosing this hotel:1. The location2. We stayed at the Peninsula in Bangkok and were hoping this would be a similar experience.Firstly the location is excellent. It was walking distance from the food street market, and the &quot;night&quot; market. The shops and shopping mall's were near by, T Square, F City etc... very close by and no need for a taxi. The best part for us was that in the evening we could walk out, eat, shop around, sit down have a drink and people watch!Now for the hotel itself, the service lived up to the Peninsula standard and we can't fault it in any way. However, the room not so. The room was OK but not what we expected after the Peninsula in Bangkok. I think if you are considering staying in this hotel the minimum category of room you should book is a Grand Delux Room anything less will not be a 5 star standard. Also the lobby and mall is really quite and it dosen't have the grand feel that you expect.We used room services a a couple of times and ate in the western restruant (can't recall the name) once, and had breakfast. It was all as expected and very good.I would recommend this hotel to anyone considering it, and I would stay there again if the price was right. However, it did not live up to the standards we expected.Hope that helped"
18,117,"Aug 13 2009 	One of the Best in Beijing	We have stayed in the peninsula for 3 nights in June 2008. The hotel is very well located for the main shopping and also for dinner. You can see immidiatly their high standarts, very classy, clean and the staff is really good. Food for breakfast is amazing!Swimming pool is good and you can spend some time there to relax.Very Good Hotel."
19,117,"Aug 10 2009 	The place to stay in Beijing	I stayed in the peninsula for three nights in July. It was my second stay there - the previous one having been in 2006. the peninsula has maintained its high impeccable standards. The hotel is located ideally located for the main shopping areas and Tianemmen square as one could want. the level of Service was as good as one could want. As others have noted, the location does mean that one does occasionally get hassled by art &quot;students&quot; and those wanting to push other servicesbut you can learn to ignore those. The Spa which has been refurbished since my last visit is excellent and has one of the best relaxation areas I have seen any where. The swimming pool is also of a good size and has excellent relaxation beds. Highly recommended."
20,117,"Jul 30 2009 	Everything top of the line...	Conveniently located within an easy walk to the Forbidden City, Tienanmen Square, the pedestrian shopping street, and &quot;food alley&quot;, the Peninsula never lets your forget that you've signed up for five-star service. Friendly, competent hotel staff listen to your requests and answer all your questions. The rooms weren't overly large, but they were well appointed with TVs in all the bathrooms, and free wireless internet in the room. The buffet breakfast is wonderfully diverse, complete with everything from fresh-squeezed OJ, bagels with lox &amp; cream cheese, and con gee. I would definitely stay there again."
21,117,"Jul 24 2009 	I've Seen the Promised Land	I've never had a more pleasant hotel stay than my recent week at the Peninsula Beijing. Everything was first rate. In fact, the service was so over-the-top attentive that, for an independent-minded sort like myself, it was mildly annoying, at times--like the bathroom attendant who turns on the faucet for you. But I mean that in a good way, if that makes any sense. Pay up to stay on the club floor. The included breakfast alone is worth it--good coffee, a broad selection of Eastern and Western foods--and the happy hour (also included) is a very pleasant bonus after a day spent working or touring a sometimes hot, clamorous city. Plus--for you non-Mandarin speakers--the staff in the club speaks the best English in a hotel where nearly everyone speaks well. The Peninsula's gym and the pool are some of the better ones I've seen in a hotel. They were included in the price of our room as was internet access. And the location, assuming you want to be in the center of the city, is excellent--an easy walk from all the major sites."
22,117,"Jul 21 2009 	Best in town!	I have stayed at the Peninsula Beijing several times, and it is ALWAYS good!From the moment they pick you up at the airport with their swanky Rolls Royce it sets the standard for the perfect stay. Ok, the lobby is a little 90s with the tacky marble horses and staircase, but it is the people that works here that makes the stay memorable! The rooms are very comfortable with all the equipment you can desire. The towels are the thickest you can get anywhere. The spa is a part of the ESPA chain, that you can experience on other top hotels as well. Great treatments everytime, but expensive.....Pool and fitness area are top notch!You have to try the crispy duck in the restaurant in the basement, worlds best! The interior of the restaurant is also worth an extra glance, spotless and cool! In a city where service still is &quot;a new kid in town&quot;, the Peninsula is the place to be!"
23,117,"Jul 10 2009 	Top notch service	I have absolutely zero complaints about this hotel. The room was great and we had plenty of room. Bathroom with TV was excellent. The bed was hard, but still comfortable if that makes sense. Every member of the staff was extremely helpful. It's really the small details that impressed me - when I had to call housekeeping, the woman answered the phone in English and used my name (almost all the employees called me by name). After calling housekeeping to get some drinking water one time, I didn't have to call anymore. They would come into our room when we were gone and leave us tons of water and fresh ice. The location was good, however we encountered a few cabs throughout the city who refused to drive us to this hotel. I don't know if they didn't know where it was or just didn't want to go there. Breakfast was great - omlettes made to order, waffles, fruit, pastries, breakfast meats, and some Chinese selections as well. Service at breakfast was outstanding. You don't expect your chair pulled out for you at a buffet, and certainly not everytime you get up. Breakfast was inclulded in our room rate. I wouldn't have paid for it otherwise as it was expensive to purchase on its own.Overall, this was an excellent hotel and not as expensive as other Peninsulas."
24,117,"Jul 6 2009 	Old classic but luxurious and dependable as ever	I stayed here for 4 nights in June and got an excellent rate via the British Airways website. I first stayed at the Peninsula Palace Hotel about 9 years ago and have been back many times. Despite the huge growth in number of international 5-star hotels in Beijing, this grand hotel is still one of the very best. I cannot understand why this hotel is not ranked in the top 3 in Beijing. The service here is as impeccable as ever. Staff in the restaurant at breakfast are attentive and efficient. The buffet breakfast is excellent with many choices. The rooms are very comfortable, although without an expansive view (as most rooms will look into a neighbouring office building). The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is one of the best in the city. The location of the Peninsula cannot be beaten, a few minutes from the department stores on Wangfujiang and a few minutes away by taxi from the Forbidden City. There is a supermarket around the corner for snacks and bottled drinks if you do not want to use the more expensive minibar in the room. Across the road are 2 other newer hotels i.e. the Regent and the Legendale. Both of these hotels look good although I cannot make a comparison as I have not stayed at either. The Peninsula is an excellent choice and a safe bet for those who want a comfortable hotel with proven great service in an excellent location. There is a high end mall (e.g. Chanel, Gucci etc) in the basement levels of the hotel although this is usually empty of shoppers. Note - as the hotel is located in an area of 5-star hotels, and therefore abound with &quot;wealthy travellers&quot; by Chinese standards, you are likely to be approached by young women offering &quot;massage services&quot; if you go walking in the evening. Pretty harmless but worth being aware of. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will come back here again, despite the competition."
25,117,"Jun 21 2009 	Luxurious and perfect for a biz trip but lacking personality	This is definitely a 5 star hotel with very nice rooms and top notch service. If I were going back for work, I would definitely stay again. However, if you are going to Beijing for fun, this might be a little boring. It feels very luxe, complete with high-end shopping mall built right in. I supposed I was hoping for a bit more old school Peninsula."
26,117,Jun 16 2009 	All nice and fancy but it lacked something	Excellent service; great breakfast; AMAZING spa - out of this world. But the rooms were smallish and there was something lacking with the place. Think more memorable places exist for less money.
27,117,"Jun 14 2009 	Classy hotel	Peninsula hotels are very famous in the world and pretty expensive too. But, I found this one very cheap on orientaltravel.com site. It was around 120 USD, or something like that. I don't remember any more. Rooms were great, but there was no view...Hotel is excellent, on reception floor and two floors down is a luxorious shopping centre with all designer shops...I am sure Peninsula is one of the best hotels in Beijing..."
28,117,Jun 9 2009 	Tops as usual	The staff is great; rooms are fine; service is excellent. The shops in the hotel &quot;ain't&quot; bad either.The location is convenient for sightseeing. We just like the hotel!!
29,117,"Jun 1 2009 	Peninsula Class - Great trip to Beijing	fabulous trip to Beijing. The level of experience we expect from the Peninsula was delivered - and more. Very friendly staff. We ordered for some Yang Zhou fried rice at midnight (an hour after the Cantonese restraunt had closed), but the friendly man on the other end of the phone got hold of someone from the overnight dining kitchen who made a variant of the fried rice (he admitted it wouldn't be &quot;original&quot;) which was very good!!overall very well appointed hotel, great spa, good pool (though heated, but temp. should be kept higher than it is) and very prompt service (housekeeping as well as in room dining)"
30,117,"May 4 2009 	Excellent value for money would stay there every time	This was our first Peninsula and we had been warned that it wouldn't match up to the lofty standards of its sister hotels in New York and Hong Kong. We don't have that for comparison but we did compare it against our stay in the Four Seasons in Shanghai and the Peninsula beat it marginally despite it being a lot older. The staff was genuinely friendly and we appreciated the guest officer taking us on a mini tour of the room. We loved the amenities provided as well as the bathrobes and bed. There was a wide variety at breakfast, sufficient to satisfy any craving, and we really felt welcomed everywhere we went. We had afternoon tea at the Peninsula (provided as part of our Winter Escapade package), which was good, although not quite as glamorous as its Hong Kong counterpart. One good thing about the hotel is that it provides complimentary high speed internet access in its rooms - high time other hotels followed its example and stopped charging an arm and a leg for internet service. We wouldn't hesitate recommending this property to anyone."
31,117,"Apr 20 2009 	Great time while there but then there was afterward...	Booked a winter special package for an overnight stay in mid-December. I had to fly in and out of Beijing for just one night for a business-related event, and loved the service. For CNY 1300, I had a standard room, plus free breakfast, and a round-trip (not one-way, but round-trip) airport transfer in one of their new BMW 7-Series. The had a large sign with the person in a hotel uniform waiting for me at the airport, who took my bags and called down for the car to pull around. After a short ride, upon pulling into the hotel there was a full staff of people standing outside (in the December cold) for my arrival. One to open the car door, one for my bags, one to open the hotel door, and one who was taking me straight to my room to check-in(no front desk). Once in my room, I relaxed, went down to the pool while having my clothes/shoes prepped for the evening, and enjoyed taking a swim. The pool attendant laid out towels for me, brought bottled water, but would walk along side of the pool with me as I was swimming laps, a little strange having a stranger watch me swim back and forth. Came back and with my evening attire ready and laid out in the room, went off for the evening to my event. The next day, woke up and went to breakfast (also included) and was wowed by the selection and quality of the offerings, I was thoroughly pleased and stuffed. Same car service upon departure to the airport. Those who know Beijing (I used to live there, now in Shanghai) know that a taxi from Wangfujing area to the airport can be about 100 yuan, so with RT limo service saved 200 Yuan i would have otherwise been forced to spend. (Found out afterward that their standard fee for limo service is usually CNY800 one-way) Plus free breakfast, free internet, free pressing and shoe shine, I felt like it was a steal for what I paid, and the service was nice the whole time. Two complaints though (one small, the other big), first is that the room was on the small side, I really felt it could have been a bit bigger, but it was tastefully decorated and relatively modern (with 42-inch plasma). When walking into the room it was kind-of like a &quot;this is it?&quot; reaction. Second was their billing. I gave them my credit card for the room guarantee, but paid cash. Usually a guarantee (at least in my experience) is used for minibar charges when you leave or if something is un-settled and you are gone. The evening after I had left, I found out they had charged my credit card for the room (plus extra), even though my bill was paid in full, in cash, upon departure, and I had to wait 2 weeks for them to take the charge off. Was un-happy when I learned this, especially since my credit card was charged more than what my actual bill was (by almost US$100). Was embarrassing when I went to use this card and told that I didn't have enough balance (and I couldn't think of anything at all i actually purchased with it), and upon logging into my account see a charge on my card for Peninsula Beijing, when I'm holding the bill that says paid in full, in cash. Kind-of ruined my great feeling I had when I left the hotel. The hotel itself was a very nice experience, but I still don't understand their billing office."
32,117,"Mar 30 2009 	Lovely Stay	We spent 3 days at this hotel. The rooms were quite large. the Tv in the bathroom was a nice touch. Free internet was very convenient. Location was good. I just read another review, which seems to be the opposite of what we felt...this proves the great VALUE of tripadvisor. WE found the rooms to be very clean, and the service spectacular.The mood lighting in the room was very pleasant. The hotel is a bit stuffy with all the high end shops there, but its was still a very relaxing feel. The bar in the Lobby was great, snacks given to you with your drink... nice touch. The front desk and the concierges, all assisted greatly in providing directions, making reservations, and just translating a bit of chinese for me.The Spa on the other hand is WAY over rated! it is beatuiful, nice facility, but for the price i am sure you could find one for the same price and double the time. I didnt like trying to be sold one of their products.. especially after a relaxing time. If i want to buy something , I'll ask...but dont try and sell me. In the end, its your typical hotel massage.The breakfast buffet is truly huge and amazing. Pretty much everything you would want is here, and if not they'll make it. we worth the price, even though it may seem steep. We skipped lunch for 3 days cos we were full from breakfast... eliminating a lunch bill. Essentially you wont save anything... but you wont end up spending more either.We arranged a cab...not thru the hotel, but on our own, with the translation help from the doorman, for a trip to the Mutianyu section of the wall. the first quote was 900RMB, we coutered with 600, and the price was accepted. So for this price, we went to the wall, olympic venues, and the hou hai area.Also the next day we used the same cabbie for and all day rate of 500 rmb...to be our driver for 9hrs. this was perfect.ok... back to the hotel. Prior to the trip, their email correspondence the very prompt."
33,117,"Mar 23 2009 	Ok Hotel but terribly poor service and poorly managed	I've stayed at this hotel this past winter on a business trip. Traditionally, I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt, China New World, and the brand new Regent hotel (during the Olympics). This is about my 3rd time staying here but the first time in at least 6-7 years. First off, Pros: Good location and access to Wangfujing shopping. It's about a 10 minute walk to Wangfujing and 25-30 minute walk to Tiananmen square. Location can be important and this is a good locations. Rooms were good, main room is nice and acceptable for standards. Dining facilities are good. Cons: Outdated bathrooms. Terribly expensive and not a good value. My bigger issue is with the poor, slow service. Staff are slow, do not understand the need for prompt service. For example, we requested house-cleaning THREE times to come to our room because we had dry-cleaning that had to get done for our conference. Finally after the third call and approximately 45 minutes, they finally came around. My other massive gripe is the poor management of the hotel. First off, the hotel is in no way flexible with hotel changes. We were charged a &quot;no-show&quot; fee since we arrived one day after their system had said we were supposed to arrive. Either this was our corporate travel's error or Peninsula's error but when we asked Peninsula's front desk to address this issue, we received a &quot;This is company policy&quot; response. No flexibility, no hospitality. Nothing. It's not a very welcoming feeling that we got and I have to say the staff throughout the hotel was not very welcoming and we couldn't see them this way for the rest of our trip. Upon two occassions at two different breakfasts, we observed two different caucasian department heads (I think one chef and one other manager) berating Chinese staff for their performance. While this may be fine in private settings, these two managers did so in a publicly EMBARASSING and DISGRACEFUL manner that should never be accepted. The public disparaging remarks of these two managers were both unacceptable and made some of us patrons and guests uncomfortable. Upon the second manager pulling this action, we approached the manager and politely informed him that their actions were creating an unpleasant atmosphere for us. The manager responded, &quot;Thank you for your input. If there is anything other input we need from you, we'll let you know..&quot; It was both aloof and terse and quite insulting. For the standard that the Peninsula is supposed to exhibit, it falls very short. If any of you see the caucasian chef or hotel managers berating the staff in public, hope you all can speak your mind to them as well."
34,117,"Feb 27 2009 	LOVED this hotel!	My son and I stayed at The Peninsula Hotel, Beijing, in December 2008. We spent more time in our rooms than we had intended because the weather was so bitterly cold. But we enjoyed every minute of it. The accommodations were luxurious and the service superb. From the down comforters, to the deep tub, to the temperature and lighting controls, to the bathroom amenities, . . . . All three hotel restaurants were outstanding, and the breakfast buffet was the best I have ever experienced. We awoke every morning looking forward to breakfast. I didn't know there were hotels this nice in the world, and I've stayed in plenty!"
35,117,"Feb 9 2009 	Impeccible Service	In the last 3 years, I have stayed at this property 4 times, and will return again soon. I also stay at the Shangri-La in Beijing, but I find this location much better. The rooms are great, the Executive Lounge is perfect, and the food in the restaurants is a bit pricey, but excellent. The staff has always been there for anything I could ask for, and I highly reccomend this hotel."
36,117,"Jan 28 2009 	Good stay at the Peninsula but .. ??	This trip to Beijing was purely for business, and based on recommendations and previous experience with the Peninsula in Bangkok I opted for the Peninsula. I must say, it is a good hotel (on the border to a great one too at times). Service is on the mark.. however, there was something 'missing'. It was not the Peninsula in Bangkok, which at least for me touched something 'inside'. The Peninsula in Beijing was good and sometimes great, but it still fealt 'business'. Maybe part of the reason was the business district around the hotel, which did not really inspire much... at least for me. You had to go grab a taxi to get anywhere (fun). That said; to vander around the forbidden city, shopping in Wangfujing etc it was great... there are some great malls and stuff around... but for what I was looking for, I may opt to try something different for the next stay. But then again, I would not really mind going back either...."
37,117,"Nov 10 2008 	It's Definitely Growing On Me	I stayed at this hotel twice in the last two months. The first time it was just an overnight trip, and perhaps I only noticed some of the drawbacks of the hotel - chiefly the room sizes, which were designed in a different age when rooms (in the early 1990s) were not expected to be huge in deluxe hotels like many are today. There isn't a walk in shower, for instance, and just has the old standard - the walk in shower, albeit with the hard sliding screen. The hotel is definitely old school and of a certain age - with Chanel and Gucci stores in the lobby. I guess the first time I came, I expected to be absolutely blown away by a different class of hotel that people might expect of the Peninsula. That wasn't the case, so I was a little disappointed.However, I stuck with it for my recent visit in early November, and this time, having more realistic expectations of a regular 5 star hotel, I was actually impressed. I guess it's not quite like the Peninsula Hong Kong or Tokyo, but few hotels are. This hotel also has a totally different room tariff structure, so it's not like many of the negative recent reviews paid US$300 a night.The room is actually attractively designed, and is very comfortable. The bed was wonderful, and I disagree with a previous reviewer that the breakfast buffet was wanting. If you like Chinese breakfasts, you are in for a major treat. The congee and the condiments were delicious and there were so many choices I felt I'd need to eat there 3 nights to try everything.I looooved the gym. The machines were state-of-the-art, the decor was beautiful, an attendant would bring you a cold towel in the middle of your workout and all the water you'd want, and best of all there was an iPod jack in the machines so you could plug in without running your battery down.And not enough can be said of the location. Some people might like the Grand Hyatt location better (as it is closer to Tiananmen) but I feel the Peninsula is closer to the attractions and shopping on Wangfujing and surrounding streets and it's easy to hop in a cab and go anywhere. My walk from the Great Hall of the People to the hotel one night took just 20 minutes (at a brisk pace).The hotel is not going to bowl you over. But I thought all the service staff had an excellent attitude and were very helpful. You particularly may not find a more competent concierge staff than at the Pen in Beijing."
38,117,"Nov 4 2008 	Below par service and staff for a Peninsula....	We just spent 5 nights at the Peninsula Beijing because I got a great rate on the room with breakfast and wanted a safe and comfortable place since it was our first time in Beijing. It is in a solid location, close to everything. Unfortunately our first 24 hours there were a bit unsettling. We checked into in a deluxe room (fancy name for standard), which was comfortable. First the toilet had problems but that was quickly fixed. That should have been a warning of the things to come. We had a good evening and a yummy breakfast at the buffet. At the buffet, there was a wait every morning we went down regardless of the time. There was only one person seating the guests and the line often backed up. How could this be for a buffet breakfast?! Obviously they need to review their staffing charts. Once seated, there were lots of servers but unclear on what the did either. I actually filled out the comment card since there did not seem to be enough servers inside refilling coffee/tea either. To be honest, we had better service at Sheraton Saigon than the Peninsula Beijing. The Sheraton buffet put theirs to shame. I'm a huge Starwood fan and had debated between the St. Regis which was a tad farther from the center but now wonder wish I had stuck with my loyalties. I figured in Asia, Peninsula is the gold standard after our stay in the HK Peninsula. Sadly I was wrong. If that is their benchmark, they have a long way to go!After breakfast on day 1, we returned to our room, which we had cleaned. Looking to change into jeans, I quickly realized they were no where to be found! Luckily I had worn them on the plane and into the hotel, so I knew they had to be somewhere, but definitely were no longer in our room. I was NOT a happy camper. My husband and I went down to reception. He was paranoid about his computer, since it did not fit into the tiny safe they provide. This was the first time, we had a safe the size of a shoe box. Upon informing the hotel resident manager, the housekeeper came to our room. The head of housekeeping also showed up but was very unsympathetic (surprise, surprise,....). We spent over an hour talking in circles of translations to track down my jeans. Miracliously, after insisting they be found, the housekeeper had an epiphany and recovered them...........in another guest room. I was highly confused and not comfortable with the hotel at all. We even went to the watch the security video but the mystery of how my jeans went from the desk chair in our room into another guest room remained a mystery. At the end of the day, all I wanted was my jeans back and am glad we were so aggressive with the staff. Sad that we had to be, since we had missed the first full morning of first day in Beijing. After the general manager arrived, he apologized profusely and promised us to move us to another floor. No, I did not want the same woman cleaning our room going forward. Upon returning from our outing, they moved us into a suite with a larger safe. On day four of our stay, we learned that this room actually had access to the club floor. It would have been nice to know this benefit sooner. The club floor was highly unimpressive, especially since they had four staffers standing in the center to greet you but then continued to converse among each other while you tried to figure out what was available. It made you feel like you were invading their club, versus them being at your service. Highly bizarre. Funny how when another colleague arrived at the floor and went around to help guests, they just continued to socialize. Highly unprofessional.I would NEVER pay full price for this hotel. I had read earlier reviews about this hotel not being that modern. The facilities and rooms are fine. I have issues with the staff and service, which is what typically differentiates the Peninsula vs. its competitors. So sad....In Beijing, I would highly recommend you stay with an American chain, where they understand how to manage guests and not take guests' possessions. Yes, I am still mystified by the disappearance of my jeans."
39,117,"Nov 1 2008 	Should rename to Pennysula hotel	It is supposed to be one of the best hotel in Beijing, but we were very disappointed. We reserved a king size bed, instead we were given 2 double beds when we checked in. It took almost 30 minutes to check us in. No tissue paper, no tooth brush, was supplied in the room, running out of toilet paper was a norm, by the way, the toilet paper was so hard and poor quality, I went out to get my own. Any yet, they still only provide you with 2 half roll each time. Go figure!The staff were polite but the service at the cafe was below average. The breakfast was expensive and the food was always the same. Breakfast was RMB 250+ a person, fresh squeeze orange juice, good egg omelete should be a must for that price. The juice was diluted with water, and the omelete was oily with a tiny spoon of ham and mushrooms, you can't even taste the cheese even though I had order double cheese. After 2 days, we went across street to Novotel and had our breakfast there. It's not only cheaper but more selections. The Novotel breakfast buffet was RMB 149+ per person, I don't mind the juice not freshly squeezed for that price. The chef there made me an omlete exactly to my order, little oil with lots of ham, mushrooms and cheese. We had our lunch in the Chinese Restaurant at the Penisula, I could not believe the tiny portion. Compare to the Grand Hyatt Beijing around the corner, this is an expensive hotel in price only."
40,117,"Oct 30 2008	Far over priced for its old facilities and poor service	The Peninsula Beijing is old and tired. The rooms are small and the furniture is old. Bath and shower are in one unit. The bath is dirty and dark and leaks all the time. Tiles are cracked and toilet is marked. Lift lobbys carpet is badly stained and smelly. Breakfast spread is poor and the service is bad. Cold tea and coffee is served in cold days and you have to fight to keep your cutleries as they dont replace them. Bar waitresses have close-to- zero knowledge on alcohol. The gym is poorly facilitated and staff has no English ability. Best surprise of all, if you are Asian looking, you may get rude treatment from their European manager as well!In Oct 2008,I forgo the chance of staying with our 5-star corporate hotel for The Peninsula Beijing, formerly known as the Palace Hotel for its name and my good memory of it fifteen years ago. I paid the market rate of over USD$330 for 3 nights. On the day of arrival, airport pickup staff held a piece of soft A4 paper with very vague print of hotel logos on, lazily standing far away from the arrival gate. Limo is good provided you can survive the 10 minutes walk with smoke and crazy traffic through the whole car park.. The Reception opened up a wrong room initially and I had to wait for 30 minutest for the correct room booked. Once in, I was shocked to see the five-star hotel with a sound reputation worldwide having very small and old fashioned guest rooms. Different from many other young 5-star hotels with rain shower separated from bath, the Peninsula's traditional handheld shower is built inside the bath which looks dirty and old and difficult to climb in. Shower water leaks and runs all over the bathroom floor even when the screen is shut. There are cracks on the wall and dirty dark marks inside the toilet bowl. Room Service setting up the welcome fruit plate looked angry when there were no tips given.Out of the 3 days stay I had to queue for breakfast 2 mornings! The Jing restaurant has poor spread of food and the staff speaks very little English. Cold tea and coffee were served all the time and my cutleries were always taken away without being replaced. There was no presence of restaurant manager for the 3 meals I had there. Lobby bar girls did not understand what a Bailey on Ice was and told me there was no such drink. When a supervisor finally brought the drink, it came without ice. Gym facilities are also poor and backwards. There are treadmills with 80% channels playing mute, dumb bells and 1 assistant who does not speak English. One more interesting incident - I walked to the staff's area by mistake and got lost. An European hotel manager interrogated me by asking for my identity and room number and escorted me out very rudely!The Peninsula Hotel Beijing is in general old and tired. Although the expatriate management staff is still hired to manage the hotel, the traditional English management presents to be way out of fashion now. Most of all, its charge is far too high for its old facility and poor service."
41,117,"Oct 12 2008 	Amazing Breakfast!	Location of this hotel was only 5 min walk from the main shopping area and around 15 mins to the Forbidden City, around 20 mins to Tiananmen Square. The hotel overall is excellent but for the price, the room was a bit small with a very small bathroom. Also be careful of the sippery floor in the bathroom - quite dangerous. Price of the hotel may have been higher than usual due to the Paralympics being held in Beijing.Breakfast was the best thing about staying here! It was amazing. A wide variety of western and Asian dishes, cooked in front of you and made to order.Generally a very good western style hotel."
42,117,Aug 27 2008 	Very nice but.........	Our usual hotel in Beijing was full so our travel agents put us into The Peninsula. As you would expect from such an establishment the staff/service and rooms were impeccable and the whole place exudes an atmosphere of luxury living. The hotel is also very conveniently located for shopping/sightseeing.The downsides though are the so-called Lobby Bar and the Jing restaurant. It's difficult to understand why so many hotels in this city think you would wish to relax with a drink whilst you watch fellow guests check in and luggage trolleys shuttle to and fro. I really don't wish to sit in reception whilst I sip a gin and tonic so surely a dedicated and separate bar would be a good idea. There's plenty of room for one if some alterations were made to the deserted (and very expensive) shopping arcade at lower ground floor level.The hotel's website records a testimonial from Conde Naste Traveller magazine suggesting that the Jing restaurant is &quot;one of the world's top 75 new restaurants&quot;. The people from Conde Naste really should get out a bit more because if their statement is true then I'm a banana! I had both dinner and breakfast in Jing (the latter because I couldn't believe breakfast could be that bad - it was). Both were bland and (by Beijing standards) expensive with little to no inspiration which is surely the principal idea of a &quot;fusion&quot; restaurant.Do give the hotel a go but I'd book a restaurant outside.
43,117,"Aug 26 2008 	loved the Peninsular	After taking a long and exciting tour around China, taking in all the usual sites, We returned to Beijing to saty at the Peninsular to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were not disapointed , our room was lovely ( club room ). The club lounge was excellent from the check in to departure. Infact it was so good we had to tear ourselves away to venture out side. Would recomend this hotel the service was excellent."
44,117,"Aug 17 2008 	Loved this Hotel	A wonderful week, close to fantastic shopping street, we arrived the day before the Olympic torch arrived. People couldn't have been nicer, Jing was fab for food and meeting other Americans.Our stay included visits to the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, and Summer Place and a lunch at one of the wonderous restaurants where the waiters and waitress dress as the Emperor and Empress did, plus the food was great. Our next stop Xian."
45,117,"Aug 17 2008 	Olympic Gold	Stayed for 5 nights in the run-up to the Olympics and before the corporate sponsors took over all the major properties for the Games.Your other reviewers have commented on the age of the hotel car fleet. Well, they are now all brand new BMW 7 Series augmented by a couple of long wheel base Rolls Royce Phantoms all in British Racing Green, making for a pleasant airport transfer.We stayed in one of the Beijing suites on one of the higher floors. Suite was very large, well furnished and equipped. Excellent standard of housekeeping and overall a good place to relax and recover from the oppressive heat and draining humidity. Suites give access to the Club Lounge which was well served with friendly and polite staff.Spa is now run by Espa and was good with strong Chinese traditional massage. Pool is a respectable 18 metres and benefits from daylight. Clean and well tended.The Huang Ting Chinese restaurant was excellent with friendly service and delicious dim sum for lunch and an addictive Peking Duck which was the best we have ever eaten. Enjoyed the Lobby Bar which was buzzy and with a first class jazz trio for late evenings. The lychee martinis were delicious.Yes, it is populated by every luxury brand outlet including Harry Winston, so it is perhaps a bit of a high-end mall but it clearly cements its status as the Grande Dame of the high end hotels in Beijing.Location is the real winner, it is walking distance to Tiananmen and the Forbidden City and doormen were very helpful in providing directions for taxi drivers to less well known sites such as Beijing's interesting mosques.In a city with plenty of competition for your custom, the Peninsula delivers in terms of service, continuous investment and attention to detail. Not all others will last the marathon."
46,117,"Jul 19 2008 	Great Stay	Some friends and I stayed at the Peninsula Beijing for 3 nights in May 2008. It was the first stop of a three week trip throughout Asia and the Peninsula Beijing set a pretty high standard for the rest of our accommodations to live up to. Although the bathrooms aren't as luxurious as those found at other Peninsula properties, this hotel had many outstanding amenities.Check -in was quite fast and efficient. The check-in person was incredibly helpful. He was kind enough to exchange some dollars while we dropped off our bags and hailed us a cab so we could hit the nightlife before it got too late.The hotel lobby is nice and the lower levels have quite the shopping selection (all high-end boutiques: Louis Vitton, Cartier, et al). The lobby bar seemed a bit out of place but was nevertheless fun. One night they even had jazz flute!The breakfast was great as was room service.The only negative we noticed was the airport transfer service. The car we were taken in was quite old, worn and out dated.Other than that, the Peninsula Beijing is in a great location and provides wonderful amenities. Not quite as luxurious as the Beverly Hills location or Hong Kong location, but for Beijing, it's at the higher end."
47,117,"Jul 18 2008 	Amazing my fav hotel so far!	The Peninsula is just amazing, the room is huge and beautiful, the bathroom is beatifully done. The luxury shops at base level/ground level also makes the penisula stand out from other luxury hotels in Beijing. Enjoy live piano/classical music while taking a tea break and also the hotel restaurant Jing is highly recommended! The autosphere is beautiful and the food is the best I've had in a chinese restaurant. The breakfast is also great, with a wide range of western and chinese food. Some people might say the peninsula beijing is not on the same standard as the peninsular in Hong Kong or else where, but at the same time, remember it is also a lot cheaper. Where else can you find a great 5 star hotel for less than 150? you can easily spend that on some 3 star hotels in other cities!"
48,117,"Jul 11 2008 	Sub-Standard for a Peninsula Hotel	At first glance upon entering the Lobby the evening I checked in, I thought this would be equivalent to both Hong Kong and the Beverly Hills properties in terms of service/quality and overall impression. I was wrong. Service quality is just not up to standard of their other properties. No one seemed willing to go out of their way to help or assist. The thing I love about the other Peninsula properties i have stayed at is that they almost anticipate my needs before I even ask. This was not the case at this property. The standard rooms are also very small. Free bottled water comes once a day in the evening around 8pm - and they are small half bottles so you ould wait all day to have something to drink in your room again. One one day, i had the privacy button turned on in my room and when i came back tomy room, the maid was actually in my room cleaning it! They need better training. I had left some valuables out in the room and was not happy about this. Their wi-fi service was slow and intermittent, althought complimentary. The hotel was virtually empty (as were many other Beijing hotels at this time) and yet the hotel was unwilling to give me an upgrade (for a fee) to the club floor. The hotel airport transfers were sub par as well -- the greeters at the airport were disorganized and made us walk around the parking garage with them to find the car instead of keeping us in a pick up spot to wait for the car to come to us. When it did arrive, it was an OLD model mercedes which compared to other hotels like the Mandarin Oriental or Regent, was very below standard. I would not use their car service again for the amount of money paid (about $100 each way). Doormen were pretty god for getting taxis. Restaurant Jing was a good breakfast buffet but on the expensive side - $40 a person. Overall, i would not recommend this property, especially for those of you who regularly stay at Peninsula Hotels. I will stay at other luxury properties on my subsequent trips to Beijing. There are several newer properties like the Grand Hyatt, and the Grand Millenium, as well as the Regent."
49,117,"Jun 12 2008 	a nice hotel but some drawbacks	We spent four nights at the Peninsula Beijing with two rooms for the four of us on a club floor. The rooms were attractive and comfortable, nice bathrooms, nice bath products. There is a nice lounge chair next to the window for sitting, as well as a desk with good access to outlets etc. When you enter the hotel, there is no lobby as such, the lobby consists of a large staircase, a bar/lounge, and Chanel, Hermes etc etc store. It is really a tacky retail environment, I don't care how &quot;exclusive&quot; those stores are, I expect an actual lobby with a place to sit and wait for people without having to buy a drink. It feels like a mall.There is NO place to sit in the lobby.The club offered excellent breakfast, snacks, hors d'oeurves at dinner hour, and drinks. The staff in the club were friendly, helpful, and really welcoming. Only complaint about club room was that the only comfy upholstered chairs and sofa were in the smoking area, and at one point they acrtually let someone smoke a cigar. The entire floor smelled, as there is no real separation beytween smoking and nonsmoking.. The location is an easy walk to Wangfujing St with the night market, etc.This is a nice plush hotel but given the lack of decent public areas, I think it is not really special. If not for the club floor, I would give it a worse review."
50,117,"Jun 11 2008 	A great place to stay in Beijing	My opinion of this hotel will be very different from that of the reviewer below me. We spent four nights in the Peninsula and found it quite excellent. Check-in was smooth, despite the fact that we arrived after midnight and the desk staff at that time tends to be peopled by the less English speaking staff. But it was no problem. Our bags were brought up speedily and no requests or overtures for tips were made at any time during our stay. On check-out we received a late check-out time of 15:00 without any problems.The room (on the 7th floor - not a suite or part of the club floor) was fairly large and well appointed with everything one would need, but it was smaller than at some of the Shangri La properties where we stayed. It was definitely larger than some of the rooms I've stayed in luxury hotels in New York City - so really no issue on the size of the room. There was no perceivable smell of smoke anywhere in the hotel or in our room. We had no problem plugging any of our electronics (and we had quite a few, each with different style plugs) in the universal outlets available throughout the room. I actually found that quite clever.The bed was harder than I expected. It was more along the lines of Chinese preference for super firm matresses, rather than the firm, but soft, Western beds. The Shangri La has much better beds, in my opinion The bathroom was large, not huge. The shower was powerful and hot. No complaints there.The breakfast buffet was varied, fresh and delicious (the pain au chocolat I had every morning was flaky, buttery and could have come straight out of a Paris bakery - I was impressed) and the staff was very courteous and helpful. There is no view at Jing and it is downstairs. The lighting is subdued. It's fine for breakfast. We also had Peking duck at the other restaurant in the hotel, Huang Ting. It was absolutely delicious and were told it is the best Peking duck in Beijing (by a long-time western resident who takes his best clients there). Excellent service and lovely atmosphere in Huang Ting.The outside staff was always ready to hail a cab for us, hand us a hotel card with the taxi's number on it and to tell the driver where to go in Chinese. They did this each time we went out. No tip overtures and no tip given. We also arranged with the concierge for private cars twice - once to go to Summer Palace for the day and once to go to Simatai. It was all very smooth with excellent drivers and cars at a decent price (not what a local would pay, but whatever). We used the spa one evening. It was a beautiful spa and just huge. But, I was not too keen on the massage, unfortunately. I found the therapist got tired after a bit and was not applying enough pressure. My travel partner, instead, said he received the best massage of his life. And price wise, the Peninsula is good value at just over $185 per night, including breakfast, drinks and taxes. Overall, excellent"
51,117,"Jun 9 2008 	AWESOME!!	After traveling worldwide, this is the best hotel my husband and I have stayed in. We would not hesitate to recommend it to friends and would stay here again should we return to Beijing. The service is impeccable, the rooms spotless and modern, the bathroom roomy. I can't say enough nice things about it."
52,117,"Jun 9 2008 	One star service in a three star room at a five star price	Five star hotels face a lot of trouble with their clients because in the service industries customer satisfaction is always tied to expectations. And lets face it, its a tough mix to master: courtesy, consideration, and going the extra mile for a customer without being obsequious or intrusive. Its a wonder that it happens anywhere. The expectations are that much higher at five star hotels price points. A customer naturally expects something for what he or she is paying.But a number of hotels I have been to, particularly in Asia, have succeeded in this mix to a degree that stuns. The Peninsula Beijing, unfortunately, is not one of them. It is, by far, the poorest excuse for a five star hotel I have ever stayed in. Lets start with a few lesser details. First, the rooms. I was upgraded to the largest non-suite sized room at the club level. Most Americans will probably find the room unbearably small. Other reviewers have complained about the cigarette smoke in the nonsmoking rooms. The Peninsula has yet to remedy that situation. The sheets in my room reeked of smoke, an error that could have been avoided easily by more attentive management. I will admit that the bathroom was a decent size. And there are cool switches for every light you can think of to the side of the bed, as well as a large plasma TV, though these days its pretty rare to find a top property in Japan or China that doesnt have one in every room. You will need to ask the hotel for an adapter if youre using appliances with American voltage. Asking the hotel for anything, however, will usually involve a tip, even if its something youd ordinarily expect a room to have. Theres a scene in Curb Your Enthusiasm (Episode 40 for fans) where Larry stays at the Regency in New York and has to tip the guy who fixes the faulty air conditioning. Thats more or less what service is like at the Peninsula.On to the food. Breakfast at the Jing restaurant is simply dreadful. The spread compares unfavorably to a number of four stars Ive been to, and the quality of the food is simply appalling. The pastries, for example, are uniformly damp, almost stale. Theres a good omelette station, but I havent been to many hotels that have flubbed an omelette. The restaurant itself lacks a view and is dark, so you kind of feel like youve been transported to a high school during a brownout. And then theres the service. The staff at Jing looks and acts severely depressed, and can be rude to boot. I witnessed a waitress practically flinging coffee at an American customer because she asked for hot coffee after getting a cold cup. Jing is the worst breakfast experience I have ever had at a hotel.As other reviewers have noted, check-in is uncoordinated. When I arrived, my bags were lying around the reception area completely unattended to. After I finished check-in, I had to locate a bellhop to find my bags.By nearly any measure I can think of, the Peninsula is a disappointment. Ultimately, however, the joylessness of the hotel is its greatest drawback. Its employees lack of enthusiasm is contagious. And unless its important to you to stay in a hotel that sells overpriced designer goods in its basement (thats a draw?), youll save` money and have a better experience at just about any other top hotel in the city."
53,117,"May 27 2008 	The Peninsula revisited--an oasis !	We decide to revisit The Peninsula, Beijing and stayed 2 nights in May 2008 after visiting cities on the Silk Road...Dunhuang, Turpan , Urumqi and Kashgar. My last stay at The Peninsula in March 2007 was somewhat marred by the smell of cigarette smoke even though we stayed on a non-smoking floor but we were pleased that the hotel did something to rectify the situation then. Therefore, we opted to stay again at the hotel.During this recent trip to China, we stayed in some of the better hotels along the route, but they paled in comparison with The Peninsula. When we arrived at the hotel, it was like stepping into an oasis. The grand deluxe room we stayed in was comfortable and &quot;luxurious&quot;. They provided nice touches, like...freshly ironed linen floor cloth placed beside the bed next to the bedroom slippers so that we could step onto it when we got up from bed ! That said, the non-smoking floor where our room was situated was what it was supposed to be- smoke-free and it was also very quiet.The service at Jing Restaurant was good and the buffet breakfast serving both Western and Chinese food was excellent. The waffles tasted just as good. The location of the hotel is wonderful, and it was just a short walk to the main shopping area and to the food street selling all kinds of barbequed food and snacks . We arrived at the hotel just when the staff were observing a 3 minutes' silence for the victims of the Sichuan earthquake. The reception staff apologised for keeping us waiting but really no apology was required as guests should be understanding. We felt that the service from the staff was good and they acted &quot;human&quot;, and were not &quot;robotic&quot; in going about their duties."
54,117,"May 17 2008 	Good not brilliant.	Sub-standard to Peninsula properties in Bankok and Hong Kong. Rooms ok, Peninsula-kind touches present. However staff not too professional: porters shouting at each other over who will is to fetch my luggage for 5 min in the main lobby while customer (me) standing right next to them. Hotel transfer to airport Mercedes or R-R? How about a 10+ years old Audi?!Swimming pool currently closed &quot;for renovation&quot;. Overall OK but defintely not excellent."
55,117,"May 13 2008 	Great stay with a few ""reservations""!	We stayed at the Penn for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay however there were some pluses and minuses to this hotel that we wanted to share:Pluses:We told them it was our anniversary and they had a free bottle of wine in our room upon our arrival---Nice touch!The Club Floor is worth the extra money and the breakfast is fabulous. Our room was great, top floor and away from the elevators.Wonderful location, close to shopping, restaurants, food and sights!Very helpful and attentive staff, Francos on the club floor is superb!Fabulous piano player in the lobby, enjoyed listening to her.Minuses:We stayed directly under the club floor and could hear people walking around.The shower is not properly sealed and leaks water on to the floor.The Club Floor is a little anal about removing glasses from the floor.ATM machine frequently runs out of money.Would we stay there again? Yes, we would and would recommend the hotel to our friends. So, the pluses heavily outweigh the minuses!"
56,117,"May 8 2008 	Overratted ageing Hotel	After reading all the great reviews we were expecting something magical. Don't be fooled this is a tired, ageing hotel with rooms looking more like a 2 star property than 5 star. Definately not a world class hotel by any stretch of the imagination. Beds were so hard that you might as well of slept on the floor, Bathrooms also in poor condition.BEWARE DON'T BE FOOLED GO ELSEWHERE!"
57,117,"Apr 9 2008 	Best Concierge in Town	My husband and I had a wonderful 5-night stay at Beijing's The Peninsula in mid-March 2008. The hotels very fancy lobby houses not only a classy bar area, complete with live piano and violin music, but also an upscale mall with dozens of stores like Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Channel, and similar boutiques. Fortunately, it also has one of the hottest dining spots in town: &quot;Jing&quot; restaurant. In addition to delicious dinners, Jing's breakfast buffet is tremendous. It serves everything from Western-style bacon and eggs, to Chinese favorites, like dumplings and noodles. The food and service were impeccable.The Peninsula's rooms are spacious and elegant. Our room (not a suite) had almost 400 square feet of living space - it was huge! The hotel also offers free internet, awesome plasma TV and lots of other free amenities. Very luxurious.My only complaint, and it's not a big one, is that our view from the 9th floor overlooked nothing but the construction going on in the pool area behind the hotel. No biggie, the good at this hotel far outweighs the bad.The hotel is also centrally located. It's 2 blocks from WangFuJing Rd - big shopping area with late night eateries. Its also about 1.5 miles from Tiananmen Square. It's a nice walk to T.Square, but cab it if you're in a hurry. Lastly, the concierge service was stellar. First, the concierge desk was always well staffed - 5 or 6 people at the desk. Second, the desk closed only from 11:30 pm to about 6 am. We don't speak Mandarin, so we relied heavily on their help. Each staff member spoke English, and was professional, courteous and never uttered the words &quot;no&quot; or &quot;we can't help you.&quot; They recommended restaurants and attractions, gave us Beijing travel tips, ran out to purchase our night-train tickets to Shanghai, and happily wrote our destinations in Chinese symbols to hand to our non-English speaking taxi drivers. They were invaluable. Best concierge service I've experienced in a while. We highly recommend The Peninsula."
58,117,"Apr 7 2008 	I would only go back to Beijing if I could stay in Peninsula	After having horrible experience in the hotel booked through our travel package, I booked Peninsula directly. Definitely a great move as all staff spoke English, the room was excellent for the price (we got upgraded after the staff heard our horror story), the staff were very professional, friendly and ready to help. The food was expensive but worth it. Worth the trip and the money. The boutiques in the hotel is definitely a major plus. Didn't have to go far for shopping."
59,117,"Mar 28 2008 	Could I live here?! Because I really didn't want to leave!!	We stayed in the Peninsula Hotel Beijing for nearly a week last July after finding out about the hotel on this website and booking it on their webpage!The minute we walked into the magnific lobby we loved it! The shops! The music! The space! When were shown up to our rooms, well, we were very impressed ! There was a jacuzzi bath and 2 TVs (one in the bathroom!)! The pool was so beautiful! We went swimming every morning, we could sit by the pool, drink the water and eat the fresh apples that were served! It was so relaxing - very tranqil!The restaurants were delicious also! There was 2 restaurants - I loved the Jing restaurant (and when ever I ate in the hotel I ate here or in the lobby!) I LOVED the HUGE buffet brekfast - waffles, a fri, cereal, fruit, fresh juices, warm cakes.... what ever you want! We also ate dinner here - you can eat as much as you want for roughly EUR30 per person and even though it might be slightly expensive - it is absolute quality cusine!!! The staff are unbelievably helpful and nice and the service is fab!It is situated beautifully within walking distanse of some of the main tourists attracions of Beijing ie. Tianamen Square! Beijings main shopping centre is also right around the coner - where some lovely shops are! If you are planning on going to the Great Wall you can arrange the trip via the hotel! Also the hotel are known for there fantastic concierge service and you can book restaurants and shows (ie. the brilliant acrobatic show!) There is possibly a million more things I could say about this hotel but the point is it makes for a brilliant holiday, or stay in Beijing and to be honest I really hope I will make it back here for another holiday soon!!!"
60,117,"Mar 25 2008 	5 well earned stars!	I stayed at this hotel for 3 days.Firstly found booking using the package which is cheaper than just booking the room often! - met at the airport, very efficient, driven in a very good car directly to the hotel, swiftly booked in, given great advice and reasonably priced tours (chose my own, sort of pick &amp; mix, it included lunch, charges and a guide as well as an excellent driver and car.Hotel rooms were excellent, best sleep I've ever had!!Jing for fusion food, try the buffet, it was excellent and a snitch at the price.Great breakfast in Jing too, better than the one in the Chinese restaurant.Taken back to the airport in style.Superb."
61,117,"Mar 15 2008	Absolutely loved it!!	Our entire experience surpassed our expectations during our 4 night stay.In my opinion the best location in the city.Can walk or take the subway everywhere esp now that new subway lines are opening up in time for the Olympics.We booked on their website an Executive suite which included airport transfers and club-lounge access for less than $300 usd a night.Check-in was quick and easy and we were also upgraded to a Duplex suite!! This would have cost us over $700 a night during peak tourist season.Not sure I would want to be in Beijing during the hot summer months.The pollution,mass group tourism and smog would be too much.Club lounge had good selection of food for breakfast and during happy hour.Great self-serve selection of alcoholic drinks and soft drinks.The staff were very nice and spoke to us about our daily experiences in their city.It seemed sincere every time they asked.The Forbidden City and T-Square are within walking distance as are the many Hutongs,High-end shopping malls and subway stops.This is a safe city so you can walk everywhere without worrying about ending up in a bad area and robbed.We also tried a lot of different food including food stalls and not once were we sick.The two restaurants at the hotels have great food esp the Chinese one on lower floor.Would stay here again without a doubt.The Regent up the street looked promising as well.Before of young Chinese trying to speak English with you.Most want something-like taking you to a tea ceremony and stick you with the bill,buy cheap art,lady sex etc.Minor nuisance but if you know ahead of time what to expect then its not a problem.Usually outside the major hotels or tourist sights.Taxi's are horrible.They dont stop for pedestrians and dont speak English so be prepared and know where you are going.Overall loved the hotel and loved Beijing."
62,117,"Mar 1 2008	Great Stay at the Peninsula	I chose this hotel from all the great reviews out there plus a lower winter rate. My stay was split into 2 visits, with 1 day in between. The first 2 nights I booked the Executive Suite. The only major complaint I have for this hotel is the size of the room. Otherwise all else was perfect. The service there was just about the best I've experienced. The meet at the door and in-room check-in was very classy. The staff were very welcoming. In the room I found all the amenities to be above par. The 2 two plasma TV's cleanly mounted to the wall with many english speaking channels, mood lighting in every part of the room including the bathroom, bathroom TV and control panel, master bedside control panel... all GREAT. Again, just on the small side. The other minor complaints I have are the old construction of the hotel which gives it smaller windows (the newer hotels seem to have big floor to ceiling windows) and an interior design that does not blow you away.On my 2nd stay I was put right into their Beijing Suite. Now this is just about the finest hotel room I have stayed in. There was a nice foyer an office space with luxurious desk, dining table for 4, living room with surround sound system and plasma TV, single bathroom and larger master bathroom and all the same technology. The glass enclosed chinese artifacts are a nice touch. This was one satisfied hotel snob."
63,117,"Feb 24 2008 	Outstanding Experience	Overall, this was a fabulous hotel. I visited on vacation but this hotel would also work well for business travel. I look forward to returning here. The room was beautiful with contemporary Asian decor and the bathroom was spa-like. The pictures on the Peninsula website are very accurate, up to date depictions of the hotel.I recommend including the breakfast buffet in your package. It was delicious. The concierge desk was very helpful and provided excellent recommendations."
64,117,"Feb 24 2008 	Another Satisfied Customer	I stayed at the Peninsular with my wife and teenage son, taking advantage of a special offer on the web site to get a Beijing Suite on the club floor at a very good rate of 2500 RNB / day.We spend most of our holidays at top end hotels, preferring Four Seasons where possible. No Four Seasons in Beijing - so we tried The Peninsular and were not disappointed. The basics - staff - decor - beds were all very good or excellentThe location is good for tourists, it is within walking distance of Wangfujing street (shops) and and 15 min walk to Tianamen Square or the Forbidden Palace. The location may not be stated as ideal for the financial district, but in truth it is only a 10 minute taxi ride away but not something that should deter anyone from staying here. The club floor is a true club floor, quiet, well serviced, good quality snacks, free drinks during happy hour and plenty of staff to give you that extra bit of support. The staff go out of their way to make personal contact. Worth paying extra for.There are two restaurants on site, a standard Chinese, and a Fusion restaurant. The fusion food is interesting, the Chinese, not of a greater standard than that found in any western city. Perhaps there should be a greater variety of eating places in a hotel of this standard.The Concierge service was a little disappointing. They could not recommend any Italian restaurants outside the hotel (try the Regent across the road or the Hyatt), did not know why we could not get access to the People's Congress (Plenary Session due next week), and the Great Wall Trip was only average. Maybe you should look to find your own guide before you arrive. The club floor staff were more knowledgeable and helpful (for instance telling me the best place to see the construction on the Olympic stadium). This is a very good hotel. Consider it strongly for business or pleasure, but bear in mind the limitations of the concierge service and try some restaurants outside the hotel."
65,117,"Feb 14 2008 	Well Located and Great Staff!	The Peninsula is well located near the Forbidden City and the Wangfujing shopping district. It is quite safe to walk around the neighborhood, which we did several times. For times when you need to take a taxi, the Peninsula staff have it down to a science. The doormen speak English and tell the taxi driver where you are going. They hand you a small card with several common tourist destinations printed on it in both Chinese and English, and also has a note on the other side to the taxi driver who will drive you back again. It says something like &quot;Driver--please take me to the Peninsula Hotel.&quot; The doorman will also note down on your card the taxi's identification number, in case you run into problems or lose something in the car.Check-in at the Peninsula is a very smooth process. One of the desk clerks comes upstairs to your room with you and does the check-in from there. It's very nice, especially if you are just coming from the airport from a long international flight, which we were.Our room was very comfortable, with a king size bed and a small sitting area with sofa and tv. The bathroom was well appointed and the walk-in closet was large.Breakfast in the hotel is delicious with a good selection of Chinese, Japanese, and Western food choices. The only problem is that sometimes the main serving area gets too full, so they direct you downstairs to one of the other restaurants. The food is the same in both locations, but sitting downstairs you feel much less ambience. On the other hand, it's nice not to have to wait to eat. The moral of the story: get up before the main breakfast area fills up.We had afternoon tea one day in the hotel and it was also excellent, although not particularly Chinese. If you are looking for a more authentic Chinese experience, you can skip the tea. We were just in the mood to sit and rest, so we had the tea and enjoyed it, but it is a totally western experience.The pool at the Peninsula is fairly nice, although not luxurious. It is heated and indoors (but with doors that open onto an outdoor terrace), so you can use it even in cool weather. The locker room staff was very attentive and quick to bring towels, ponytail holders, and anything else you need.The main drawback that I saw to the whole Peninsula experience was that it has what is basically a small shopping mall full of luxury brand stores in its lobby and basement levels. It features very high end shopping like Harry Winston diamonds. On one hand, it's cool to see all of those places. On the other hand, it is a little bit of a distraction to go down to the restaurants and pass through a mall.Overall, I enjoyed staying at the Peninsula very much, highly recommend it, and think that the location cannot be beat."
66,117,"Feb 12 2008 	Highly Recommended!	My husband and I stayed at the Peninsula in August. This after spending the last 10 days in Mongolian Gers. Needless to say, any hotel would be welcome after the &quot;rustic&quot; gers. We walked into the Peninsula and were immediately sent to the Club level floor for check-in. We had a club room, but they upgraded us to a Beijing suite. We were completely fussed over by several people all dressed in impeccable suites. We loved the attention - but here we were all dirty and underdressed - and they were fawning all over US? It felt great. We were sent to the room, and OMG it was so gorgeous!! Very high end and loaded with all the ammenities you can imagine. Sprinkled throughout the rooms were snacks all labeled with descriptons. We ate them as we toured through the rooms.I cannot begin to tell you how nicely appointed the room was. Two bathrooms, bedroom, closets, office area and large living room with flat screen tv's and so on - curtains that close and open via remote. Absolutely stunning and large!The club executive level facilities were well taken care of and all the food you could want or expect to see are there all the time. The breakfast plentiful, all the COKE you could want. Nowhere else in China were we freely given refills on COKE! We spent three days at this hotel and nowhere else in China were we greeted so warmly - and by name! Nowhere else in China did we encounter familiar breakfast items - like scrambled eggs, croissants and corn flakes. This truly was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend the hotel. When we go back to Beijing - this is where we will stay again. Unfortunately, I cannot say I enjoyed Beijing that much - way too crowded. The club executive level was a nice getaway from the hussle and bussle of this city."
67,117,"Feb 12 2008	loved it	very nice room(modern decor ,lcd , good size ,bed)and restaurantsLOVED breakfast buffetperfect location 15 minutes walk to everything:wangfujin,square and forbiden citydont miss peking duckalways good to stay at a peninsula hotel still saving to try it in hong kong"
68,117,"Feb 7 2008 	Great stay fantastic breakfast spread	Our group stayed at this hotel. I have traveled throughout China and I have not stayed at another 5-star hotel that compares. The rooms were fantastic, clean and convenient. The staff were extremely helpful and polite (not always the case if you are a Chinese traveling in China). And the breakfast spread is an experience in and of itself!! There was the continental pastries corner, the Chinese breakfast corner with rice porridge and all the condiments you could ever imagine, a made-to-order eggs and meat section, AND a European deli-style corner! I stayed there 5 nights and looked forward to breakfast every morning.The fitness center is also very nice although not 24 hours. They have staff that help you operate the machines, cold water, and fresh air.Great hotel, great price, great location. You can't ask for more."
69,117,"Feb 4 2008	Enjoyable Stay - Nice Hotel Great Location	We only spent a short period of time at the Peninsula Beijing however we thoroughly enjoyed it. We stayed in a duplex suite as the rooms are located on the top floor with city views. We had noticed that the other rooms were quite small in size, and we also noticed from pictures posted on Trip advisor that some of the rooms were directly facing another building - we definately wanted to avoid getting this type of view!The suite was really nice though still quite small compared to other hotel suites. When we checked in, the staff at the main reception were not very friendly however thankfully they were not the people to check us in - they took us to the Club Lounge floor check in. The staff here were slightly more friendlier and professional - they offered us a drink and quickly checked us in. We were escorted to our room which just had beautiful fresh roses placed in the lounge and also upstairs in our bedroom. We were also given a large fruit platter(lots of Chinese fruit that we had not tasted before, it was great to experience their local produce) . Our escort was really nice and showed us around the room - our ceiling to wall window offered great views of the city(our escort stated ' the best views in the city'). The bathroom was quite small though beautifully presented - all marble and has a television over the bath. Both floors were nicely furnished and very modern - more importantly, comfortable.The Club Lounge benefits are very good- they offer buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks/snacks. We actually had the breakfast at Jing instead of the Club Lounge(they give the option of taking breakfast at either Jing or the Lounge - l would definately recommend Jing- so much better! ) Great breakfast, everything you could want for breakfast is available, it's fresh and it's all delicious. For afternoon tea, they offer coffees/teas and biscuits, fine chocolates, sandwiches, scones etc - good variety. The evening drinks are also pretty good - they offer warm snacks and a variety of wines and spirits. If you are staying at this hotel, l would recommed taking advantage the Club Lounge - it's worth the extra cost. The only fault with the Club Lounge is the staff - they are not very friendly or attentive and they look very bored and disinterested - actually, all the Peninsula staff do not offer the kind of service you'd expect from a five star hotel...The best thing about this hotel is it's location, it's close to the main tourist attractions and around the corner from the main shopping street &amp; a night street market. Also another great thing about hotel is Jing restaurant - the breakfast is great however the dinner is absolutely scrumptious-definately the best food l have ever tasted! The peking duck is amazing, not to be missed! Overall, l would stay at this hotel again - great location, fantastic food, nice hotel however staff service could be better."
70,117,"Jan 9 2008 	Wow!	I stayed at the Peninsula Beijing for 6 nights over Christmas with my father in 2 rooms. This hotel is fabulous and beautiful, truely 5 stars and very reasonably priced for the rooms and service. I booked a Rolls Royce for airport pickup which was a nice touch. They called ahead as we were nearing the hotel so when we arrived their was a team of people waiting on us to take our bags and escort us straight to our rooms for in-room check in! The easiest hotel check in I have ever had.The rooms were very nice and the location was good. Near the shopping street and also within walking distance of the forbidden city. The staff was always friendly and very helpful. Both hotel restaurants were excellent (but also overpriced compared to those outside the hotel) and the shopping mall in the hotel with every designer imaginable made it fun to window shop. On Christmas Eve they left a stocking in both our rooms with food goodies and a bear dressed up like santa, a very nice touch.I had an in room massage which wasn't very good at all but for less than $50 for 60 minutes I can't really complain. Also we booked a private tour around Beijing with a guide through the hotel which we were not happy with. However, when we informed the hotel they offered to give us another tour free of charge! We did not take them up on their offer but in my opinion the hotel tours were overpriced for what you get.Those are the only minor gripes I can come up with...my overall experience at the Peninsula Beijing was about as close to perfection as I have ever experienced!"
71,117,"Dec 29 2007 	Disappointing	We were disappointed with Peninsula Beijing. It can't be compared to his fabulous sister hotel in Bangkok.The hotel ist old and worn out. There are many better, cheaper and modern hotels in beijing. We booked a room on the club floor and were upgraded to a duplex suite. Even this room could not convince us (design, view, room configuration..). The Club room is a quiet zone and nice option for breakfast (instead of the huge restaurant downstairs without any sun light). The Club room has also some nice views over town. Still, it is a bit worn out, small, only one internet access, and the services inconsistent. F.ex. afternoon tea/cocktails run out regularly before time. The breakfast choices were very limited (small kitchen).The worst thing was the spa complex. It looked like a very basic public swimming pool, the massage/fitness complex was nothing to speak off either. I heard this part of the hotel will be renovated soon.We one had dinner at the Jing restaurant. The service and food was good, but the restaurant is too big and unpersonal to feel comfortable. So does the entrance hall.My advice: skip Peninsula Beijing and stay at one of the recently opened new and modern hotels."
72,117,"Dec 25 2007	Disapponted	I am a great fan of the Peninsula in Bangkok so thought Beijing would be as great...booked and stayed for two nights in the Beijing Suite (enormous) at a competiive winter rate...but totally lacked the sparkle I had anticipated. There was the expected welcome note from the manager and the bowl of fresh fruit...but my view out of my suite was overlooking another building, the decor looked a little &quot;old school&quot; and oh the hard bed! I thought &quot;The Jing&quot; restaurant was okay as I was craving a good steak after 10days in China...but would not recommend it for people wanting to eat out in Beijing.The Club lounge access was disappointing as there is no chef or kitchen on the club level and therefore food tasted precooked and boring.Must admit it was great to order a DVD (from a limited library) , get fluffed up in my bathrobe and watch TV from my bath.......but moved the next day across the road to The Regent Hotel for a much better deal!"
73,117,"Nov 26 2007 	Great hotel great location	We stayed at the Peninsula for 3 nights at the end of October and were very impressed with all aspects of our stay. We were picked up direct from the airport by the hotel and our check in at the hotel was done in our room which was pretty efficient.As per previous reviews, the rooms are not that big but there's certainly enough room for a comfortable stay. The bathroom was excellent and offered a choice of a bath or walk in shower. There was a large screen TV and free dvds if you got bored (which we didn't) We had a nice view of the front of the hotel and it was entertaining watching all the cars and people going past.The room and hotel were extremely clean and we couldn't fault the maid service.A large number of the staff spoke English and we received a lot of advice from the concierge about where to go especially at night.We would definately stay at this hotel again."
74,117,"Nov 26 2007	Harold USA South Carolina 2nd Time Around	This is my second time around staying at the Peninsula Hotel in Beijing. The second time was better than the first which I though was impossible. I arrived on my Birthday October the 25th 2007. They knew that it was my Birthday and sent a wonderful Birthday cake to my room. They upgraded me to a Deluxe King Suite when I presented my Platinum American Express. The Entire Staff at the hotel are wonderful. I could go on for every concerning this Fine Hotel, but I want. You just need to experience it to believe it. Enough Said: Just Do It"
75,117,Nov 26 2007 	Great hotel great location...	I stayed in the Peninsula Beijing for 3 nights recently and was extremely satisfied with my overall experience. The hotel itself is in a good location being about a 20 minute walk to Tienamen Square and the Forbidden City. It is also very close to Wangfujing Street. The level of service and number english speaking staff is great. The interior of the hotel is beautiful and the only reservation I have is that the rooms are a little on the small side but are extremely comfortable and well appointed. Both restaurants in the hotel (Jing and Huang Ting) are great and reasonably priced and the breakfast served in Jing is excellent. DVD rentals in the hotel are free and there is a good selection as Chinese tv is not that interesting. Overall Beijing is a relatively inexpensive place to visit. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone thinking of staying in Beijing.
76,117,"Nov 12 2007	Stay elsewhere	I would not recommend this hotel for myriad reasons. The carpet was stained, rendering the floor an unappetizing option despite the uncomfortable bed. The concierge service was uninformed about anything beyond 300 metres of the hotel. The amenities within the hotel were subpar, and this should be rated a 2 star property on its absolute best day. Very disappointing"
77,117,"Nov 9 2007 	Gold Medal Winner!	The Peninsula in Beijing is strictly first class. The rooms aren't spacious, but they are well laid out and beautifully furnished. High-speed internet connection is free and easy to use. The linens and towels are luxurious and bountiful. The bathroom could use a little more counter space, but the glass-enclosed tub provided a great shower.Room service both morning and night was prompt and impeccable. The front desk staff was welcoming, efficient and helpful and spoke excellent English. In fact, the entire staff spoke English more than adequate for their functions.The hotel is just a 10-15 minute walk from Tiananmen Square and the entrance to the Forbidden City with convenient shopping nearby."
78,117,"Nov 8 2007 	Peninsula Hotel Beijing Outstanding!	We stayed at The Peninsula Beijing for a week this past October 2007. Our stay there was wonderful. From the moment our taxi pulled up in front of the hotel the staff made us feel welcome. Our bags were immediately taken by the bellhop. We were then escorted to the Member's Floor and given drinks and food while we were seated and checked in. This was a very welcome treat after spending 14 hours in an airplane! We were then escorted to our lovely room. The room was spotless and had everything we could want, including an Internet connection. As guests on the Member's Floor we enjoyed a super breakfast buffet which included a variety of foods for different ethnic guests. Also, in the afternoons they provided a lovely tea which featured a nice variety of food and drinks for the guests.The staff at the hotel were always friendly, prompt, and eager to help us in any way needed. They arranged a tour for us which included a very bright English speaking tour guide. We were not taken to any places that pressured us into buying things. On another occassion, the hotel arranged for us to have a car for the day at a very reasonable rate. Our room was always cleaned promptly in the morning and in the evening. The hotel common areas were always clean. We never saw anything out of place or messy. The hotel is located in a good location which allowed us to have convenient access to the tourist sights, stores, etc. The two hotel restaurants were both excellent with very friendy staff. Overall, we were extemely happy with our stay at the Peninsula Beijing. We would not hesitate to stay there again or to advise others to do so. V.A. White[--]"
79,117,"Nov 7 2007 	an excellent hotel	We stayed 3 nights after a Princess Cruise and were very pleased with the Peninsula. We had a Grand Deluxe room which was spacious and beautifully appointed and our rate included breakfast in the Jing dining room. Service was first rate. The location is ideal and an easy walk to the Wangfujing street mall, Oriental Mall and a doable walk to the Forbidden City. A $2 cab to the Silk market. (Street blocks are very long in Beijing and taxis are dirt cheap.) Lots of restaurants nearby and the hotel dining room was excellent and not unreasonable but avoid the inviting dinner buffet and order a la carte. The food looks great on the buffet but sits too long and was not hot. The breakfast buffet is plentiful. I would return without question but you should appreciate that there are a number of 5 star hotels in the area like the Oriental, Raffles, Grand Hyatt, Regent, etc and you might want to compare. You would never go wrong however with the Peninsula, one of the best hotels in the world."
80,117,"Oct 28 2007	Staff could be better	Booked this hotel via travel agent for three nights for a club deluxe room. Since booking I have watched this hotel slowly slip down the ratings on Trip Advisor &amp; now I can see why. The first thing that got my back up was the pompus reception who told me that I was on club rate but did not mean I got a club room, when I presented my Asia Miles card he said he couldn't give the points as the room was booked through a travel agent. We did get a larger 'L' shaped room on the normal floors which was comfortable &amp; spacious. Second thing to annoy me was when we went to the Club lounge for breakfast on our first morning my wife was accosted by the manager to say we shouldn't have been in there. I guess they do not train their staff to understand the booking database on the computer. Needless to say the breakfast was poor &amp; although there was a chef walking around we couldn't have eggs how we wanted them. Our next two mornings we had breakfast in the standard restaurant but when we came out people were waiting to be seated with tables standing empty.Watch out Peninsular the world is coming in 2008 &amp; you need to improve on your hotel very soon."
81,117,"Oct 26 2007 	Would definately go back	The Peninsula is a brilliant hotel. It's positioned very close to the main shoppng area and very close to the Forbidden City and Tianamen Square. The lobby is huge, decorated with black marble and has it's own shopping arcade with Tiffanys, Cartier and other top brand names. Check-in was a pleasure with very pleasant staff who all spoke exceptional English. The rooms are large with 42 inch flat screen tv's, coffee making facilities, hairdryer, iron and ironing board. The mini-bar is very well stocked and for a 5 star hotel exceptionally cheap! The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have ever experienced. It is situated in the Jing restaurant that is below ground but had something to suit anyone. From eggs and bacon to miso soup; danish, a massive choice of fruit, they will make pancakes or waffles for you, omlettes, in fact just about anything you want - even baked beans! We used the hotel for a day trip to the Badaling Great Wall and found their own tour guides to be very good. Our guide was called Lily in english and tailored our day around what we wanted to do - most of the tours you book will take you to a jade market or something like that, but as our tour was tailored it was made to suit us. It cost about 1900 yuen per person for the day and that included all entrance fees, a fantastic chinese lunch and a visit to the ming tombs. It left when we wanted to from the hotel and dropped us back when we were ready.I would definately recommend this hotel."
82,117,"Oct 22 2007 	Beautiful rooms noisy tour groups and public areas	We have just returned from Beijing having spent two night at the Peninsula in two interconnecting Grand Deluxe Club rooms. The rooms were attractive, spotless, and very comfortable if a teensy bit on the small side. The rooms really felt luxurious. Unfortunately, once we left our room the serenity was shattered. We found that the hotel was filled to the brim with tour groups. The lobby is super noisy and packed with very large tour groups waiting for buses, and checking in and out. The elevators were stuffed full as was the club lounge, and the hallways were quite busy with guests day and night. We found the highly touted academy tours that are supposedly exclusive to the hotel to be over-priced, standard, run-of-the-mill tours and were quite dissapointed in this regard. Huang Ting was one of the high points of our stay and truly outstanding (absolutely don't miss this restaurant!) while we thought that Jing was good but not a must. We found the staff on the Club level to be helpful and attentive. Overall, I have mixed feelings about our stay at the Peninsula. It may be that my expectations were too high or that we chose a bad time for our stay as it coincided with the stay of so many tour groups. There isn't anything wrong with tour groups it's simply that the design of the public areas of the hotel, from the lobby to elevators and hallways, doesn't seem to accomodate these groups well creating an atmosphere where the groups feel obtrusive. So obtrusive in fact that it compromised our feelings about our stay."
83,117,"Oct 21 2007 	Perhaps 5 stars for Beijing	The location of the hotel is good, 30 mins walk to theForbidden City and 10 mins walk to the Metro station.The room is good, with large plasma TV, centralisedcontrol panel for light, TV/Video etc. The daily turndownservice brings us bottled water. The room providesin-room fax machine, robes, slippers and umbrella(!)but not iron.I got English newspaper delivered to our door twicein 4 days stay. The breakfast was very good and providedfor both Chinese/Western clients. I don't find the conceigeparticularly helpful. The swimming pool is OK but hadbad view of an older building next door. Didn't even providea jacuzzi near the swimming pool. There is no movie ondemand but the hotel provided a DVD library so just neededto contact the house-keeping and they would deliver theDVD to your room. Perhaps I didn't stay in the Club room.I found the bathroom granite titles looked a bit used.Perhaps it is 5 stars in Beijing standard but compared toNorth America, I don't think it is 5 stars."
84,117,"Oct 16 2007	Really Disappointed - Can't believe it's the same hotel	We spent nine nights in this place and I really can't imagine where the other people who wrote the positive reviews stayed...The room was tiny and I mean tiny. The room service trolley / table couldn't get past the bed and sideboard. The massage therapist couldn't find a place to put her massage table except directly between the bed and the sideboard. We were put on floor 4, maybe saved especially for westerners? (Four sounds like 'death' in Chinese so it does make me wonder).The view was of a horrible looking restaurant, and an office building which contained people who seemed to work 24 hours a day, we had zero privacy if we opened our curtains.The best thing about this room was the shower which was very powerful, but Beijing water feels greasy, so maybe not that great.Everything about this place is expensive and I live in London so I know expensive. The prices are what you would expect to pay in a fairly good London hotel and the food is nothing to write home about.I would of thought, given what we paid for this room and the length of time we were staying there we would have been given something better.I thought our experience in this hotel was a good reflection of Beijing as a whole. Unpleasant. My experience of this place was that I was seen as a big, round-eyed money box, they showed little regard for anything and the pollution was absolutely vile. I would never go back and I don't know how they will ever be ready for the Olympics.Verdict - Don't bother!"
85,117,"Oct 11 2007 	Tour Groups Overwhelm the upscale look and feel	Pros: Location is very good for walking to Forbidden City, Tianaman Square, long pedestrian shopping street, large indoor malls, high end designer shops, night market, a few good places to eat, quick taxi ride to other sites depending on traffic and time of day, very good service from housekeeping staff, spa/fitness center staff, bell staff and car service to from airport; a nice feature for the room was the large flat panel tv, high tech room features that you could change/use at bedside; great designer shops within the hotel; room service was prompt and professional, seperate tub and shower, tv in bathroom, very nice fitness center, pool and spa; bed was comfortableNegatives: Air Conditioning was never at a comfortable temperature even after maintenance &quot;worked&quot; on it, tour buses with large groups coming and going as well as checking in and out; service at the breakfast buffet, concierge service was variable depending on which one worked with you; room and bathroom was an average size for a nice hotel; check in was quick but very impersonal and highly mechanical and felt like the person checking us in was on some kind of time quotaOverall: I had heard and read so many positive things about this hotel that I was anticipating much more than what we experienced. Although the service was good it was not excellent and seemed very rushed, impersonal and mechanical. The hotel seems to get alot of tour groups so there are always huge tour buses coming and going and big groups checking in or out; and the breakfast buffet that we had heard so much about was very expansive for selections either asian or western but service was esentially nonexistant. We left this hotel dissapointed and felt it was way overrated and seems to have become biased toward large tour groups which leave the individual traveler &quot;lost&quot; in the mass of tourists."
86,117,"Oct 1 2007 	AMAZING hotel	I can not imagine that anyone could have anything to complain about here! It was as close to perfection as I have experienced. Our room was lovely, average size, nice bathroom, plasma TV. The view was unremarkable but that was fine. At night the turn down service arranged your slippers on a towel by the bed, dimmed lights, turned on soft classical music and left a mint on the pillow!!! The buffet breakfast was just unbelievable, everything you could want &quot;American&quot; style as well as many delicious Chinese dishes - I could have noodles for breakfast every day! The Chinese restaurant was quite good as well.The service was top notch. Our needs were antcipated and exceeded regularly.The location was great, just off the main pedestrian street which is so busy you wouldn't want to stay on it.There are lots of fancy shmancy stores in the hotel - Hermes, Chanel etc - fun to window shop unless you have a lot of cash to spare.Business center was very clean, convenient and easily accessible.Our stay there was nothing less than perfect, I can't recommend it enough!"
87,117,"Sep 11 2007 	comfortable stay	not my first stay here but a relatively pain free experience in a sometimes otherwise hectic city.the welcome back fruit basket actually had some delicious fruits ( vs. cheap fruits i.e. a la starbucks fruit salad style), free internet access is a blessing (not the case with all Beijing hotels), housekeeping was efficient (quick turnaround for requests like toothbrush-- but why don't they just supply it to start out with?) despite facing tthe main street noise was not an issue, the bathtub looked inviting as usual, the arcade convenient, the location also makes life easier.the only annoyance was both of my roomkeys did not work (immediately after check in) and when I went back to the front desk there was only 1 person behind the desk helping someone else that seemed to have been there for a long timestill one of my favs in Beijing"
88,117,"Sep 10 2007 	A genuinely outstanding hotel	We stayed for 5 nights at the Peninsula Beijing, and felt completely at home and very relaxed. It's fair to say that this hotel has gone for a slightly older fashioned sense of luxury, when compared to some of the glass palaces that pop up these days. At least on the surface, you'd think that it was aimed at old-money colonials. But scratch the surface, and you'll find everything that could make your stay more comfortable and more convenient. I'll explain;The location of this hotel is excellent. It's just off the main shopping street, with its widely varied shops and large indoor malls. You can walk to the Forbidden City in about 15-25 minutes (depending on the entrance you use), and Tienanmen Square in about 20 minutes. If you go off in the other direction, you'll go through some pretty cool neighbourhoods, with a variety of boutiques, uber-chic hair salons, and some local markets and hutongs. The room we booked (a grand deluxe) was amply equipped, with a vast plasma screen in the bedroom, and a smaller one in the bathroom. There was also a DVD player, and a superb bedside panel containing controls for the TV, radio, air-conditioning, lighting, privacy signal, valet service, etc. The panel by the door and the room's main telephone even displayed the outside temperature and humidity percentage. The room wasn't massive, but it was a good size, with sufficient storage for our 5 night stay. The maid service was remarkable; they folded all clothes they could see, and kept the room feeling and looking fresh at all times. One day, we made the schoolboy error of leaving the safe open while we went off to the Great Wall. After a few minutes of concern, we realised that our things would probably be OK, considering the conscientious nature of the hotel staff. Indeed, on our return, the room was immaculate, and the safe had been pushed closed. All contents were safe and present. Phew... The only drawback with the room was the safe. It's not big enough to contain a laptop. Therefore, I had to use the hotel's safety deposit boxes, behind reception. This was fine, and free of charge, but a little inconvenient.Other hotel services were very good, too. We used one of the hotel's recommended drivers to take us to the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall. The price was reasonable (far less than a coach tour), and the driver was friendly and helpful. He waited patiently at the bottom of the cable car, and sped us home through the beautiful countryside when we were ready to go back. The doormen of the hotel were very helpful and friendly, and liked to have a chat and make recommendations. The same can be said for some of the concierges. We also ordered room service (in-room dining) a few times, and were very pleased with the results. Unusually good food. We also ate in both of the hotel's restaurants, and found the food to be beautifully presented and extremely tasty. Not cheap, but what do you expect? If you want cheap snacks, walk a couple of hundred metres to the nighttime foodmarket, where you can buy deep-fried scorpions, starfish, squid, etc. I wasn't brave enough...This was the third hotel we used in China, and was easily the best. It wasn't as flash or modern as the others, but it was just as fresh and sleek, and quite a lot more comfortable and convenient. They seem to have paid more attention to the details than many other hotels do - even down to the elevators/lifts, for which you barely had to wait, due to the ratio of rooms to lifts. We'd love to go back to Beijing, and wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Peninsula again. A superb hotel, with superb services and a superb location. We were very sad to leave."
89,117,"Aug 22 2007 	Loved the Peninsula	Quite suprised by negative reviews. Went to beijing, shanghai and HK and could not find a service like this. The concierge is helpful, all staff is unobstrusive and will adress your every need. Also stayed at the royal meridien shanghai and langham place in hong kong and I thought the overall experience was better at the Pen (upon leaving to china I thought it would be exactly the opposite). The rooms will be serviced many times a day in a very discrete way, they always seem to have a floor manager responsible for managing the staff. The breakfast was also among the best I have found in china and better than the langham (although still not comparable to some hotels in malaysia for instance). Stayed at a deluxe room and thought the room was small but had everything we needed and it all worked fine / good hotel maintenance (mp3/mp4 player, plasma, tv in bathroom, valet parking button, outside temperature indicator, dvd player and free movies to watch). The hotel has 3 floors of overpriced high-end brands like L. Vutton, Chanel, D&amp;G, Hermes and so on but products often cost 3 or 4 times more than in my hometown. Good to look at the nice store displays though..."
90,117,"Aug 16 2007 	Great room good location	Also, really surprised about negative comments. The Peninsula Beijing is great and is located in a good area. Room was very nice with a lot of electronic gadgets...Restaurants are expensive for Beijing but the service was good.It is true that their Lobby looks like a LUXURY mall; but I went to Beijing to visit the city, not their lobby (apparently this shopping mall is a good address for the local people...)"
91,117,"Aug 8 2007 	Business hotel of international standard	Overall feel:This is trying hard to be as western as possible. The interior of lobby and rooms could be taken out of any good business hotel in the western world, but this corporate style may feel dull and lifeless depending on your preferences. Service:However, when you deal with the staff if is very clear that we are in the middle of Beijing. Any request verging outside the reheased phrases will throw them. This is china afterall. Waiters are nervous and shaking when serving, any questions or requests are met with terrified looks. This is not the fault of the staff or hotel, it is cultural - this type of hotels feel natural in frankfurt but awkward in Beijing. Lobby/bar/restaurants:The hotel in a high end shopping mall with all the global brands such as prada, gucci, tiffany's, etc. I guess the hotel feels this add to the glam factor as these shops are literally in the lobby and directly by the two restaurants. I find this gave me a feel of being in a shopping mall. The bar is totally boring and sits on the lobby floor. no views (not that you get much views in Beijing anyways given the pollution), and no character or soul.Had a dinner at Jing. This is also where they serve breakfast. It is totally boring and even more souless. Menu is very uninspired, but my steak was fine. Breafast is very standard business hotel stuff, and whats on offer is a good display of how difficult it must be to get good produce in China.Tours:Did a private tour of Ming tombs and the wall arranged by hotel. this included a car with driver accompanied by a guide. This was satisfactory and nice helpful guide. DO:book airport transfer through the hotel, it is safer, cleaner, quicker etcConclusion: Certainly not a destination hotel, it is fine if you need a bed for the night but otherwise a dull dull place."
92,117,"Aug 6 2007 	Had a great time	When we checked in they immediately upgraded us to a larger room. I have learned from traveling throughout China is that as soon as you check into any hotel, the first thing you do is ask for an upgraded room. The room was clean and spacious. The hotel is in a central location. The buffet breakfast was excellent. We faced the same prblem at all the five star hotels we sttayed at and that is that the english the staff speaks and understands is limited. When we had computer problems they immediately sent up a representative late at night to assist us. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. We wanted to buy souvenirs not from the typical tourist trap stores and no one at the hotel would tell us where we could shop. The stores located at the lobby of the hotel are expensive and no bargains we to be had."
93,117,"Aug 5 2007	great hotel	I am surprised by the negative reviews of this hotel. I thought it was fantastic. The room was clean and modern with a flat screen TV and electric controls throughout. The hotel lobby is full of high end stores and the staff was eager to please. The breakfast buffet was amazing. Who would expect lox and bagels in China! Beijing is a filthy, crowded city. This hotel is an oasis. They have CNN and BBC on the TV (which is denied to the citizens of China) plus real internet access (which they also don't get) and the Herald Tribune is available (which they also aren't allowed to read). Don't eat at the outdoor food vendor carts on the next block unless you like to eat shishkabob snake or goat penis. This is real chinese fare.We booked a tour through Pacific Delight which was excellent, punctual, courteous and reasonably priced. The department store a few blocks down had some good shopping, including a sculptor onsite who made busts of my wife and I while we waited for very little money."
94,117,"Jul 20 2007 	Excellent hotel	Stayed at this hotel in May 2007. Outstanding service, excellent hotel, close to major tourist attractions. Used their service whereby they pick you up at the airport &amp; then take you back--kind of costly but they earn it, devoting several people to assisting your arrival, checking you in in your room, and on departure staying with you until your luggage is checked with your airline. Almost every designer clothes shop known to man is located in this hotel as well, so there is good shopping. Had breakfast buffet there every morning--lavish, good food.I highly recommend this hotel."
95,117,"Jul 20 2007	Does not live up to the hype	We wanted to love the Peninsula Beijing but we didn't. The hotel is Western style in a good location with many high end luxury boutiques. The room was on the small side and the bathroom was very cramped. The bathtub was quite old and dirty. Aside from this, housekeeping and the laundry service were very good. A complimentary bottle of wine was in our room when we arrived. The in-room electronics were quite good.We dined at Jing (a la carte, not buffet) and through room-service. The food was average to slightly above average.The business centre is very nice but charges guests to use the internet.The pool was busy and appeared dirty. We would not swim in the pool. The gym was very nice and clean.The concierge service appeared to be very good and very efficient. They were very responsive to our emails prior to our arrival and helpful in booking tours, theatre tickets and meals. However, a tour we booked through them was a nightmare.We paid a great deal of money for a full day tour of the historical sites of China. We had been warned of the horrors of shopping trips but wrongly assumed that since the tour was booked through the Peninsula Academy program, we would be fine. The tour guide was obviously on commission from certain stores because he wasted over 2 hours of our trip trying to get us to buy things. He was very pushy and kept trying to end the tour and return to stores we previously visited. Of course, we had wasted so much time with this shopping nonsense (which is mentioned nowhere in the brochure provided by the Peninsula) that our tour of certain sites was very short. When I complained to front desk manager, she did not appear to care and did not adjust our bill. We complained to the Peninsula head office who seemed concerned and are investigating the complaint. I should point out that was also took a Hutong Tour arranged by the hotel and it was very good.We were also disappointed when the valet put us in a cab with out a metre (a big scam in China). When we tried to point it out, he didn't do anything and the cab took off. We got overcharged by about $20."
96,117,Jul 11 2007 	Nice Hotel	I stayed at the Peninsula in Sept for a weekend. The rooms we nice and clean - nothing spectacular. The restuarants at the hotel are good as well. Generally a nice western style hotel.
97,117,"Jul 11 2007 	Average Hotel - extremely poor service!	The airport pickup is great, the check in is great, the rooms are average for a 5 star hotel but the service in the (only) bland lobby bar is extremely poor. We thought this was bad until we foolishly decided to have dinner in their buffet resturant (it was my 83 year old mothers choice!). We were totally ignored by staff and were on our second food visit when the wine I asked for after we arrived was delivered. I should point out that no-one asked us about drinks I had to seek the person out, just to place the order. We could see him laughing with his work colleagues while we waited. This is a common trait in the hotel. We had after dinner drinks and asked for the bill (the staff still stood around talking) and my family had been gone for a full 10 minutes when I gave up and left only to be chased by a staff member wanting us to sign. Expecting she had the bill I was happy to do so but she said it wasn't prepared - much like the hotel. If they think this will be a flagship hotel for the Beijing Olympics and the Games reflect this, it will be a total shambles of a Games! The Peninsula Group should be ashamed."
98,117,"Jul 4 2007 	Nice Facility Indifferent Service	We stayed three nights at the Peninsula in late June 2007. Our room was on the Club Level. There were three of us so they gave us an extra large room with an alcove for a desk that was very useful for my son who was staying with us while doing 24 hour business with communication between the US and China. The guest rooms and public spaces of the Club Level were very, very nicely decorated. Pleasing high-end contemporary decor. The location of the hotel was good...nothing in Beijing is really central but from the Peninsula, you could take a longish walk to the Forbidden CIty. The hotel is arranged around a three level mall that is a luxury shopper's dream with every international high-end store that you think of (Chanel, Tiffany, Prada, Frette, a new Harry Winston)...good for browsing if you like that sort of thing. Prices are same as NY or London. We had one room service meal. It came quickly and it was good. My only quibble was that the staff at the Club Lounge seemed rather indifferent. We had just spent a week at the Portman Ritz in Shanghai where the service at the Club Lounge was extraordinary, so perhaps we were spoiled. Restaurant and theatre reservations had to be made through the main concierge desk where there was always a wait. The Club Lounge staff had spotty English language skills. You always had to ask for drink and coffee refills...it seemed like they were told to ration. An empty white wine bottle on the open bar sat unreplaced for an hour from 6 to 7PM. The most egregious shortcoming of the hotel however, and the reason I can't give it five stars was that the Club Lounge shut up tight at 10 or 11 (can't remember which) and they turned off all internet access at that time. To make matters worse, the general hotel business center shut at midnight. We had one laptop with us but it was often tied up with one of our party's long Skype business calls. So access to a second computer was essential. Someone at the Peninsula should realize that when it is midnight in Beijing, it is noon in New York and 9AM in California where most of the high tech business guests are based."
99,117,"Jul 2 2007 	Phenomenal	One of the best hotels ever. The service is wonderful. The accommodations were comfortable, clean, and first rate. I can't say enough about this hotel. The location is fantastic as well."
100,117,"Jun 22 2007	Fantastic	Just what you would expect from a 5 star property. Clean, excellent service, good food, and nice rooms. Concierge is helpful. Location of the property is good too. I preferred it to some of the other areas near the Silk Market - too much of a &quot;times Square&quot; look there. Well worth the money."
101,117,"Jun 18 2007	Overall a great experience	We stayed in the Beijing Peninsula for about three days this May. Overall the hotel was wonderful. The rooms are well appointed with modern comfortable furniture. The hotel lobby is grand and has exclusive shops - Chanel, Tiffany's etc.. We stayed on the Club floor. The amenities there were excellent - free breakfast &amp; papers. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. We tried the Cantonese restaurant on the basement level - it was fanastic. Very nicely decorated as well. The location is ok - close to one of the main shopping streets, although not terribly close to the Forbidden City, etc. Overall, well recommended."
102,117,Jun 17 2007 	Strong but not superb	stayed 5 nights here in a club level room. Strong points: location; willing service; great club floor breakfast; fabulous Cantonese restaurant Huang Ting; airport transfers a must.Weaker points: weak lobby atmosphere and bar (nearby Regent is better); no hip restaurants at all (compare Redmoon and Made in China at Grand Hyatt); basic gym and spa (nothing like Peninsula Hong Kong); spotty room service and maid service.A good rather than great experience. Need management at Hong Kong Peninsula to oversee and upgrade this well located hotel. We enjoyed it but didn't love it.
103,117,"Jun 17 2007 	Nice Hotel	We stayed in The Penninsula for 4 nights, when we arrived we found in our room a birthday cake for my husband and a complementary red wine for us.Room was nice, free internet was very useful, the flat t.v. in the room and in the bathroom were nice, we used the swiming pool a lot, Beijing was very hot and after a long day outside at The Great Wall, Forbbiden City etc, it was very nice to have the pool.The breakfast was very nice, not cheap though.We found the bar a little bit boring."
104,117,"Jun 15 2007 	Fantastic! Great for designer brand shopping!	We stayed here for 4D/3N..The service was excellent! Waiters are polite, friendly, and very accomodating at the breakfast buffet. The food was good. Design wise, the hotel lobby for me was not that beautiful compared to other Peninsula lobbies .The room was avarege for a 5-star hotel. I like the electronic control system in the room, though. It's right beside your night table. it's very convenient especially when you're already in bed, you have the control of everything inside the room. It also has an outside temperature &amp; humidity forecast .The bathroom LCD TV was innovative. I love their complementary hi-speed internet service. Most of all, I love the signature shops in the hotel. There's no need to go somewhere else for designer shopping in Beijing (Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Versace, Tiffany &amp; Co., Dior, Hermes, D&amp;G, Prada, Burberry, and much more..)."
105,117,"Jun 1 2007 	Best Hotel in Beijing	First trip to China and Beijing was the first stop. Was pleasantly surprised with the Peninsula level of luxury and service.Location: A bit from main entrance to Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square, but despite warnings of distance we were able to walk it several times. About two blocks from the major shopping street. Room: We stayed in their standard Deluxe room. It was a fairly large bedroom area, usual 5* amenities. A wonderfully large bathroom with TV and sound system. Separate soaking tub and glass shower. None of the busy road noise was heard in the room. We didn't eat in the hotel or do any shopping in the high-end western stores at the hotel, so can't comment on those."
106,117,"May 18 2007 	Great location	Stayed at the peninsula last March. We upgraded to the club floor and was fine. The lounge was very good, good breakfast, good snacks and free drinks in the early evening. Worth it. The location is just great. 30-40 minute walk to the Forbidden City and Tianamen (spelling?) Square. However, be aware, there are quite a few 20-something people who will approach you and will try to make conversation, and offer to show you around and be your guide, I'm sure for a lot of money. All you have to say is &quot; not interested, thank you&quot; and they'll leave you alone. Is kind of bothersome, but other than that enjoy the thousands and thousands of asian tourists in that area. It's always quite crowded. Can't coment on public transportation, as we were escorted most of the time by our asian business associates. However, the picture I had of Beijing people riding bicycles as the main means of transportation is no longer the case. Bikes were replaced by cars, and horrendus traffic. Try a typical peking duck, hopefully with asian friends, who can explain how is prepared and eaten. Suffice to say, most if not all parts of the duck are brought to your table for your eating enjoyment. They took us to the Great Wall, the closest part of the wall to Beijing, about 1-2 hours depending on traffic. It's magnificent, quite steep &amp; quite crowded, but hey, what's not crowded in Beijing? Try if you can to go to another area of the wall, it's further away from the city 3-4 hours, but they have a gondola going up to view the wall, and can return using the gondola, or sometype of chair lift, I don't remember exactly, but it's supposed to be not as crowded. Overall, itwas a fascinating and interesting trip, and a nice hotel to stay at."
107,117,"May 10 2007 	Good but not great for a 5 star	First off, I travel to China frequently and own a home in Hangzhou. We typically stay at the Kerry Center in Beijing, but it was sold out for this particular week so we decided to go with the Peninsula. I guess if i had never been to the Kerry Center than i would not have been as disappointed. The Peninsula has smaller rooms than the Kerry and the bar/restaurants are not as nice as the Kerry. The Kerry is more &quot;hip&quot; than the Peninsula and defintely has that vibe of an older crowd. FYI, I am in my 30's so i am not looking for a party hotel, just not geratric either. The Peninsula does have very high end shops in the hotel like Tiffany and Chanel (I am not really into that so i did not care) if that is important to you. I was also disappointed that the spa was not more accomodating, even though it was seemingly always dead. You needed reservations for massages (which is so unChina like) at the hotel which prompted us to walk to a closer massage place. I just wanted that impressed with the Peninsula..I will stay at the Kerry next time."
108,117,"Apr 22 2007 	Very nice but not my cup of tea	I stayed here for two nights last week due to a business seminar being held in situe. The hotel is extremely well located for those looking to eat out as well as walk to the Forbidden City. There are two levels of European Luxury shops under the lobby and more outside. That being said, if you find that interesting, one should ask why they're in China. Physically, this is a relatively old hotel but has been upgraded in the past couple of years. The rooms, service, restaurants, etc. all have a high level of service and efficiency. The rooms are quiet and the internet connection, wired and wireless, fast and free. English speaking staff are plentiful and truly fluent.If you really want to feel like you're in a Western hotel, surrounded by Westerners, and there are plenty that do, this is the place. That's not a knock, that's just a fact. Also, not the best value in town. I stayed the weekend, checked out and went to a hotel one block away."
109,117,"Apr 15 2007 	Great location Excellent hotel	We just returned from Beijing where we stayed at the Peninsula. This is a great hotel, idealy located: within walking distance to the forbidden city, Tianan Men square and the shopping district of Wangfuji.The buffet breakfast is incredible. And the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is excellent. Rooms are well appointed and of good size.A swiming pool, with excellent service and well equiped changing rooms (always clean and in good order) is appreciated after a long day walking in the city.Overall, an excellent stay, with outstanding services and for a good price if you get a package from the hotel."
110,117,"Apr 12 2007	Best Concierge!!	We recently stayed at the Peninsula Beijing and we definitely recommend it to everyone. We were especially blown away by the Concierge service which was outstanding. We had some unexpected changes to our itinerary and they were able to help us make alternative arrangements at 6.30am!! Their restaurant recommendationswere also excellent. We had read about an unusual restaurant deep inside the hutongs in a magazine and asked the concierge to help us find it. They even made the taxi driver speak to the restaurant staffto be sure of the way!We used the car service arranged through the hotel and found this quite expensive, but contrary to what we were told before we went to Beijing, the taxi service is not bad at all.The breakfast was not as extensive as some other hotels like Shangri-La, but food quality was top class. It was our wedding anniversary on the day we arrived, and our travel agent who happens to be a friend informed the hotel, they upgraded us to a deluxe room and had a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us!! Now that's what I call service!"
111,117,"Apr 11 2007 	Outstanding for business and sightseeing	A genuinely great luxury experience that I used for both business and sightseeing. I paid 1400 yuan ($189), which is pricey but not outrageous by Beijing standards, and for that I got included buffet breakfast at the Jing restaurant (excellent - a real feast), free wireless and also a hardwire connection, US-compatible electric plugs, and unlimited pool and gym. The room was reasonable size (14x22 feet, plus bathroom and hall area) and had a reasonable view. They picked me up at the airport (a good idea - PEK can be crazy) and waited on me hand and foot at every moment, from writing out directions in case I took a non-English-speaking cab, to coordinating with my business meetings, to handling faxes (also, there was a fax machine in the room) and setting up sightseeing tours and private cars to events and sights. The hotel is luxury class with very nice spa bathroom fixtures (Grohe and marble in my room), a surprisingly nice sound system in the room, and two excellent restaurants and a luxury shopping arcade. The gym has real weights and machines and even a rowing machine and the pool is great, housed in a solarium (not the basement). Even the cleaning staff spoke English. It is well located a short (5 minute) taxi ride from Tianenmen Square. In short, this hotel makes things easy, which is no small thing in the insanity that is Beijing. I will definitely stay here next time I'm in Beijing."
112,117,"Apr 10 2007 	Lovely Room Excellent Service Ideal Location	We stayed in the Peninsula Beijing for five nights in March. After finding the &quot;Winter Escape Package&quot; on their website, we made the final booking by phone using the toll-free Peninsula number. For the additional benefits, we chose the Club Floor and could not have been happier. When we arrived at the hotel, we were taken upstairs immediately and offered a drink in the lounge while the Club Floor staff completed the check-in forms and took our bags to the room. Although we could have had breakfast in Jing as part of the package, we found the breakfast on the Club floor delicious, plentiful, and relaxing. The same could be said for afternoon tea and cocktails in the early evening. In fact, we are light eaters; and many days we didn't have any other meals. The staff were attentive and extremely helpful. They provided maps, directions, and wonderful sightseeing suggestions complete with the names in Chinese characters for the taxi drivers. Franco Ma, a Club Floor Concierge, was a wealth of information and recommended one of the highlights of our stay -- Sunday in Jingshan Park.The room was small but extremely comfortable, quiet, and well designed with a roomy bathroom. Dinner at Jing was outstanding with a broad range of cuisines. The hotel's location made it ideal for those who enjoy walking. It was a 15 to 20 minute walk to the Forbidden City, 25 to 30 to Tianamen Square, and about 10 minutes to the pedestrian shopping street. Although we used taxis to many places, we thoroughly enjoyed being able to walk to places we visited often.We would highly recommend the Peninsula and especially the Club Floor because of the excellent and charming staff, personalized service, and value for money."
113,117,"Apr 10 2007	Best Stay Abroad Ever	HIGHLIGHTS: Truly an experience, flat panel TV, TV and sound system in bathroom, daily maid service, excellent personnel, great food, on-premise currency exchange, fluencey in English among staff, purified water in-room, remarkable rooms, good view (in our room) spacious hotel, rooms and shopping area.AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: Better labeling of foods containing fish or nuts.OVERALL: This a first-rate hotel with all the staples one would expect to find. We stayed here as part of an incentive travel experience for Konica-Minolta and found The Peninsula to be among the premiere hotels in Beijing. The trip was incredible, but this was largely due to the accomodations received as much as the cultual experience around us. While many other American travelers we encountered were complaining of staffs who didn't understand them or small rooms with stale air, we were spoiled t the Peninsula."
114,117,"Apr 3 2007 	Outstanding!!!	We recently returned from a 6 night stay at the Penn and cannot recommend this property more highly.As independent travelers, we booked the hotel directly through their web-site and they responded to our email promptly.Our winter escape package included breakfast and airport transfers.After a 16 hour flight, we were grateful to be met at the gate with acar and driver who whisked us to the hotel. Although it was  9PM, we were met at the door and checked into our room on-site.The room was clean, comfortable and excepting the lack of a coffee pot, furnished to high standards.All of the staff, particularly the concierge desk, were immensely helpful.Breakfast was bountiful, including Chinese, Japanese and European specialties with omelettes made to order.The location near Wangfujing Daije was exceptional with lots to see and do. Although we did walk tothe Forbidden City the first day, we suggest a cab instead. Save your feet. What astounded us-One evening we returned to our room to find a card and birthday cake. The staff had discovered my husbands' birthday, ( we assume from our passports) and had sent up a to-die-for chocolate mousse cake. It doesn't get any better than the Penn. It's a stay we will remember forever."
115,117,"Mar 12 2007 	Stellar	Just returned from a six day, five night stay in Beijing at the Peninsula. Stayed in an executive suite under the Winter Escapes package. Was picked up from the airport in an older S class Mercedes (thankfully as the Beijing Airport can be a zoo.). Was greeted at the front door and front desk check in was by-passed (it was done in the suite.) I would recommend booking at least a club level room because it gives you access to the private club room that serves lite fare throughout the day. All staff speaks English and were very polite and accomodating. Hotel is older and suites aren't large but very cleaned and serviced twice a day. The hotel is about a 30 minute walk to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square and a 90 minute drive to the Great Wall. There is also an open area shopping promenade two blocks from the property. As a heads up, younger Chinese will try to solicit money from you claiming they are art students from the university and want to take you to an art exhibition; happened to me five times. That aside, it is a trip everyone needs to make in their lifetime to see the incredible history the mainland has."
116,117,"Mar 10 2007 	Great hotel excellent location	I stayed 5 nights at the Peninsula Beijing back in May 2004 as an extension to my husband's business trip. His business was not in Beijing central so it was nice to move to the middle of everything! We booked a bed and breakfast rate which was perfect as we started out every day with a very large breakfast. The food was delicious and service was friendly. My only complaint is that there is no way to separate the smokers from the non-smokers (it is China after all!), but the hostess was accomodating when we asked to sit as far away as possible. Loved the wide-selection of fresh fruits.The guest room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was very large, as expected. Separate shower and bath, a toilet room, and a TV too! We got one of their then recently renovated rooms.The individual room A/C worked really well (LCD display) - at most hotels, I usually see those dials where the temp never seems right. Even more fun was the display that told you the outside temp.If this is your first time to Beijing, you cannot beat the location. I hear that the St. Regis is equal or better as a hotel, but it is not located anywhere near the Peninsula. You are steps away from shopping and a short walk to the Forbidden Palace.Service was excellent. We were given the wrong type of room when we checked in. When we informed them, we were told that our room was not quite ready and we were asked to wait a few minutes in the lounge. After we sat down, the manager came by and offered us complimentary drinks and snacks. We probably waited all of 15-20 minutes.When we went, there was no spa in the hotel. The &quot;hotel spa&quot; was a day spa located in the attached high-end shopping center. I think it was Clarins and all the prices were Western rates. You could, however, get massages in the hotel (near the gym and pool area). Mine was good, but I've had better.This was a very busy hotel when I was there. There was some car publicity event one night, a wedding another night, and the hotel just had a lot of guests! I like how you have to walk by reception to get to the elevator - a nice added measure of security for a hotel in the middle of a major city.Lastly, we never dined in (except for breakfast) and opted to eat the local food. The concierge was very helpful in assisting us in suggesting restaurants and making reservations. Plus there were plenty of dumpling places everywhere!"
117,117,"Feb 6 2007 	Great location and rooms	We choose this hotel because of its location. A short walk from shops and restaurants of Wang Fu Jing, and also short taxi ride to many of the big tourist spots.The rooms are pretty standard for this class of hotel, and the high end shops and restaurants in the lower floors serve only a very small set of clientele (read: expensive and geared toward those with money to burn).Service is generally good but like many places in China, occasionally shows a lack of polish.We'd be happy to choose the Peninsula again the next time we're in Beiing."
118,117,Jan 25 2007 	Very good with a good location	Stayed at the Pen for the first time. I have been to other Beijing hotels and I would say that this hotel is tied for first (the other is the St.Regis). I liked the location. It has a good walking street a block away and you can even walk to the Forbiden City if you wish. The hotel rooms were nice and the service was classic Peninsula. The staff was very helpfull in helping me find directions and hire a car service for a day of business. I would stay there again.
119,117,"Jan 19 2007 	Yet another truly memorable Peninsula experience	Having repeatedly stayed in the ever-flawless Peninsula Hong Kong, we chose the Peninsula Beijing for our first visit to Beijing. We were not disappointed and was welcomed with the very same Peninsula hospitality that surely make a hotel stay that much more memorable. Although not as beautiful or grand as the Peninsula Hong Kong, their matching standards does not fail to give guest the same Pen experience. We booked at the last minute and was offered the Beijing Suite at a truly unbeatable rate.Included in the rate was a roundtrip airport transfer in an S-Class Mercedes Benz. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were accorded VIP greeting by the Guest Relations representative and immediately whisked up to our suite where the check-in procedures were completed with greatest efficiency, bypassing the normal check-in counter. This is the same treatment given to guests staying in premium suites at the Peninsula Hong Kong, although not a privilege of all leading 5-star hotels. So another little thing to impress us and add to a memorable stay.The suite was perfect. The double door entry foyer featured a unique display of a lovely glass sculpture, separating the entrance from the living room and dining area creating a very lovely overall ambiance. The suite was large and featured all the luxury amenities including a large flat wide-screen plasma television (in both the living room and the bedroom), a small office area, two bathrooms, etc. Although we visited Beijing for sightseeing, the hotel is also extremely well suited for those on business trips. The location is superb especially for sightseeing, being within walking distance of the Forbidden City and the main shopping street. It is a delight to stay here and be pampered Peninsula Style. We highly recommend this lovely hotel to anyone visiting Beijing and will definitely return ourselves when our travel brings us back to this fascinating city."
120,117,"Jan 8 2007 	Great for business	Rooms were gorgeous, service was impeccable from both the general staff and the catering staff. If looking for a meeting venue, strongly consider the Peninsula Beijing. The main ballroom can fit up to 400 people. The breakout rooms are fantastic and the staff is very willing to help.Great place."
121,117,"Jan 4 2007 	Good hotel	This is an excellent hotel that certainly lives up to the Peninsula name. Booked this as part of a weekend package for my brother and two nieces. It was a great experience from check-in to check-out. Hotel is conveniently located -- a short cab ride to the major sights and near shopping and restaurants. The hotel also has a great gym and pool -- a perfect place to relax with family. My nieces enjoyed that as much as the rest of Beijing. The rooms were nice, well-decorated and extremely comfortable. Floors were quiet and hotel staff extremely helpful. Breakfast was included in the room and it was wonderful, particularly if you have children who are picky eaters. In fact, the breakfast is enough to last you until dinner. We also had drinks and dinner at one of the restaurants. There is a beautiful sculpture/fountain in the lower level of the lobby area.The only criticism I have is of the lobby. It is dark and seems to be 1/2 hotel lobby, 1/2 high-end shopping mall. It was a strange mix. But overall, this hotel was great."
122,117,"Dec 23 2006 	Impeccable through and through	The friendly and helpful staff, comfortable rooms and great food (western and traditional chinese) at this hotel hold up to the Peninsula's quality of service. Their breakfast buffets were filling enough to take me through the day with nothing more than a light snack mid-afternoon. The staff organized and shipped all my souvenirs for me. I would stay here again."
123,117,Dec 17 2006 	Wonderful from start to finish	I have spent a week at Peninsula Palace and I feel to reccomend it to anyone.I have stayed in a Club grand deluxe room. I found the room and the bathroom to be generous size. Breakfast on the Club floor was good but don't miss the breakfast at Jing. It is worth to try it!The staff are highly attentive and the concierges very prepared and friendly. The hotel is ideally located and you can walk to Tiananmen square in 20 minutes.Can't think of any negatives.
124,117,"Dec 14 2006 	A Flawless Hotel!	My husband and I arrived in Beijing after flying nearly 40 hours from the U.S. Our second flight had been terrible (15 hours, last row of seats on the plane, next to a bathroom, couldn't recline, no in flight entertainment, horrible smelling fish being cooked behind us for dinner... you get the point). You could say we weren't exactly chipper when we got to the hotel. From the first moment we arrived at the check in desk, to the last second we had before departing the people at The Peninsula put a smile on our faces. We found upon arriving that we had been upgraded to an Executive Suite. The room was phenomenal. We bascially had an apartment complete with living room, dining room, powder room, large closet space, large bedroom, and a bathroom that makes me want to be back in Beijing right now! The rooms all had &quot;mood lighting&quot; which we got a kick out of. The concierge was wonderful to deal with. She was able to book us dinner at The Courtyard (fine dining Asian fusion), and dinner at Da Dong (the best Peking duck we found). Both were outstanding. We did book our own car service to go to The Great Wall at Simatai as the rates were much better than the hotels, but that is to be expected. We're eager to go back, and to try The Peninsula in both Hong Kong and Bangkok next year."
125,117,"Dec 11 2006 	Sanctuary in Crazy Beijing	This hotel is FABULOUS! Beijing is a very busy, crowded city and the Peninsula was a wonderful retreat from the noise of the city. Every employee working there is a true professional...from the doorman to the concierge, they are absolutely the best! The concierge is extremely knowledgeable and speak the best english of anyone we encountererd in all of Beijing! The turn down service was a nice touch...mood lighting, soft music and a fresh pair of slippers on a linen next to your bed....Heaven! The Mercedes airport pick up service was much appreciated after such a long flight! If you want a first class place to stay in Beijing...the Peninsula is it!"
126,117,Dec 8 2006 	Good option	Sevice and airport pick up excellent. It was such a nice experience however the rooms a little small. Bathrooms are very small. The hotel is a good choice but space is not that big. If you are looking for a roomier hotel this is not the one. Nice boutiques at lobby and good breakfast. It is a good choice for the centric and best of all it is not in the Hotel strip where all the hotels are.
127,117,"Dec 2 2006 	Concierge could successfully negotiate world peace	This really is the place to stay in Beijing. Not only is it all about location, location, location, but the concierge desk is simply one of the best in the world. If asked, these people could negotiate world peace. The hotel is within walking distance of a number of major attractions. We were given a copy of the LUXE city guide of Beijing before we departed Hong Kong. Stay at this hotel and use this well written and hysterically funny guide of the city and you'll experience the best of the best. &quot;The Green Tea House&quot; restaurant should be a stop. It's expensive and eclectic, but very good. You must order the chocolate dessert that is warm and oozy and served in a bowl with dry ice for effect. Wild ! Its a short drive from the hotel. Don't walk, its too far. We negotiated a driver from the hotel and were slightly overcharged. We let the conierge desk know for their information and it was no big deal. Within minutes the unrequested difference in cash in an envelope was slipped under our door. Can you imagine that happening in any U.S. or Canadian Hotel ? Asia is all about service and China specifically about &quot;saving face&quot;. The people here are very welcoming.The Club floor is excellent. When you arrive, don't be put off by the outside appearance. It's what's inside that works and works nicely. The hotel run &quot;Jing&quot; restaurant is beautiful, but overpriced and like most places in Beijing, it's okay to smoke while others dine. Oh, and &quot;Made In China&quot; is a very good restaurant in the Hyatt hotel, a short walk from the Peninsula. Reservations are a must,and make sure you tell them you want to order the Peking Duck or Beggars Chicken, after all, you are in the land of origin.Get the hotel to organize a car and driver along with an English speaking guide to go to The Great Wall. We spent 9 hours with these guys and it cost about $180.00 U.S. One note, it includes lunch. Lunch is a stop at a government run gift store. You wont eat the food, unless you have been on a fast for 37 days. Tell them to pass on the lunch-stop and figure out food for you, your driver and guide on your own. Some nice touches with the &quot;turn-down&quot; services in your room at night."
128,117,"Nov 8 2006 	Palace indeed	The Peninsula Palace is a great, great hotel. The lobby bar is one of those fantastic melting pots of a meeting place with young, hip, rich Beijingers loaded down with shopping bags from the hotel's high end designer shops rubbing shoulders with foreign journos, other expats and Chinese business people. It has that real international hotel feel.The rooms, as everyone has said here, are supremely comfortable and the staff accommodating, friendly and highly professional. I did find the bed a bit hard but got used to it.The pool and massage facilities are great. Brenda's foot massage rocks!The breakfast at Jing is only surpassed by the brilliant buffet dinner there. Great value and amazing food, running the gamut from east to west in delicious style.After a day's sightseeing and shopping in mad, frenetic, exciting, wonderful Beijing, the Peninsua Palace is a truly relaxing haven and home away from home that will have you refreshed and ready to go again the next day.We were there for four nights during the Sino-African summit with the president of Egypt and Guinea and their entourages in-house. The way the hotel handled the extra security and associated busy-ness bodes well for the 2008 Olympics."
129,117,"Nov 3 2006	Treated like a queen	Arrived at hotel late in the day,and very tired from long flight.Rooms were ready and luggage in room before I was.Bed was turned down with a mint on pillow. Two bottles of water furnished every day by hotel,saved us from having to purchase.Buffet breakfast a good mix of western and Asian food.GOOD COFFEE! When you passed hotel emplyee's ,always a smiling hello,Doors opened for you whenever you went out and again when you returned.Mattresses were the best in all the trip.For a change my back wasn't killing me when I got up.Wished I knew brand,would buy one for my bed at home.Thanks to all the staff at the Palace for making the start of my China vacation so great."
130,117,"Oct 31 2006 	Extremely pleased	I reserved two Grand Deluxe rooms for a week at The Peninsula Palace Beijing during August 2006. I was extremely pleased. The exterior and the lobby are austere and clean. The check-in was easy. The room was sharp, clean and nicely appointed. Even the corridors were spotless, as if the hotel had just opened. I was a bit concerned about the room because photos on TripAdvisor, and on other sites, make it look rather spartan. As soon as I settled in, though, I realized that the reason the room looks so unassuming is because there was a place for everything and everything was in its place. The room design is well thought out. It was always a pleasure to come back to after a day of sightseeing in Beijing. The breakfast buffet in the Jing restaurant was outstanding with many choices. The entire restaurant was sparkling clean. The open kitchen was immaculate. It was a pleasure to wake up to that delicious breakfast every morning. I ate once in the Huang Ting restaurant and found it too was delicious. The staff was attentive, courteous and professional. Most spoke English and those that did not were eager to do there best to help. The morning that I checked out, I had forgotten my password to the room safe and someone was in my room to help me open it in less than 5 minutes. I can only think of two things to complain about. First, I found the bed to be a bit on the hard side. Second, the room rates are pricey. That having been said, however, it is not enough to make me not go back to the Peninsula. In fact, I did just that in late October 2006. I showed up there without a reservation and they were able to accommodate me immediately. It felt like going home again even though it was only for a night this time."
131,117,"Oct 31 2006 	Great Stay	We just spent three nights at the Peninsula, and were very pleased.We stayed in an executive club room for a very reasonable price.The 5 star rating is deserved. The hotel car picked us up and when we pulled up at the hotel a concierge met us at the curb and took us directly to our room and checked us in there. We had fresh fruit and chocolates waiting for us. The room was spacious and attractive, with a large plasma screen in the wall of the bedroom/sitting room plus another small one in the wall of the bathroom. You could sit in the bathtub and work wall control buttons for the TV, radio or speaker phone. Like most hotels, the makeup lighting in the bathroom was poor. I called the valet looking for three common room amenties I couldn't find - because they were more tastefully out of sight than I expected.Club room amenties were good, however you have to arrange tours at the concierge desk in the lobby to book tours and guides. Every concierge who waited on us did an excellent job and all the private guides they got for us were excellent. We would definitely book this hotel if we return to Beijing."
132,117,"Oct 5 2006 	Pampered at the Peninsula	Spent four nights at the Peninsula Palace in September. The Bedroom on one of the executive club floors was terrific - huge bed, internet conections, air con that obeyed us, flat screen TV and even a second TV in the bathroom! The Executive Club rooms could not be faulted with speedy check-in and check-out , great breakfasts and a splendid happy hour. The hotel is in an ideal situation near to Beijing's main sights and a shopping area. Restaurants were fine"
133,117,"Oct 3 2006 	It's not cheap but very nice	I stayed on the club level for 2 nights while on business. The service was flawless and the location excellent. I think some may expect a more luxurious stay for the amount of money, but to me the courteous and attentive staff more than compensate."
134,117,"Sep 12 2006 	Overrated	The hotel is over rated. I had planned on staying at the Peninsula for seven days; the first two days in a standard room re-checking in 4 days later in a club level room. The hotel lobby is what you would expect from a &quot;5&quot; star hotel, however, the room was the size of your standard room with a small unimpressive bathroom and the room was getting close to needing to be refurbished. It definetly was not the room I was expecting. I am sure I could have stayed at a hotel with a comparable room for 1/3 the cost.The room rate did include a wonderful breakfast and a dinner at the Jing restaurant which was excellent.The hotel is well located being close to the main shopping area and many of the important sights in Beijing. On the way to the Forbidden City we walked by the Raffles Hotel which had just re-opened and stayed there for the balance of our trip and had an outstanding stay for less money than the Peninsula."
135,117,"Sep 4 2006	Outstanding	Recently spent three nights in Beijing at the Peninsula. From the pick-up at the Airport to the check-in in our room by the Club level with Tea and Fruits and Snacks, the hotel service was outstanding. Walking distance to Forbidden City, Shopping, Tianmen Square. Booked tours through the hotel and they were perfect, we booked group tours but noone else signed up so we had private tours of the Great Wall, Forbidden city etc.. The hotels Club level lounge had wonderful breakfast and evening appetizers and drinks. Rooms are outstanding with no short-comings."
136,117,"Sep 2 2006 	Great experience; highly recommended	I stayed at the Peninsula Beijing from Aug. 25-29, 2006. I was on a business trip, but my parents joined me in China for a week-long vacation and we stayed at this hotel in two separate rooms.I was very pleased with the hotel. The service was excellent, the location is very central, and the room was exceptionally nice. (My photos don't really do it justice.) The fitness center is pretty good, and the pool is nice and was not crowded when I visited. Housekeeping is exceptional -- several times between visits to the room I noticed that they had spot cleaned and refreshed towels, made the bed, etc. The hotel is very well-staffed, and every person I met spoke basic English. The front desk staff speaks excellent English, and I noticed that many of the managers are European.I didn't think that the outside of the hotel is terribly attractive, but the inside more than makes up for it. (That said, my mom loved the outside.)I've stayed in the Grand Hyatt (twice) and a Novotel in Beijing, and overall I prefer the Peninsula and would definitely stay there again. The Grand Hyatt is very nice (and also nearby) and it has a better fitness center, but the Hyatt is usually more expensive and I think the service at the Peninsula is more friendly and less chain-like.Room service for dinner was excellent. I only had the breakfast buffet at the hotel, which was okay but not great.FYI, after a recent renovation the hotel is now just &quot;The Peninsula Beijing&quot; -- it's not called The Peninsula Palace anymore but it's the same hotel."
137,117,"Sep 1 2006 	Disappointing Peninsula	We booked a non-smoking, deluxe king room on the club floor at supposedly the best hotel in Beijing. It was very disappointing. First off, they gave us a smoking room - there way of making it non-smoking was removing the ashtrays when we pointed out to the bellman that it appeared to be a smoking room. Second the room was quite small. Crowded for two people. The bathroom was really substandard. It was a tub shower and it leaked everywhere. We planned to check out after the first night and move to the Grand Hyatt. However the Club Floor manager found out about our plans and they offered us a bi-level suite (at an increased rate) which was nicer, but still not up to the level of a 5 star hotel. I stay in a lot of 5 star hotels and this just isn't up to par. The lobby and restaurants and excellent at this hotel. Definitely worth a trip to Jing or Huang Ting for dinner, but stay elsewhere."
138,117,"Aug 24 2006 	I liked it!	I stayed at this hotel at the beginning of August booking directly at hotel website where I found a very valuable package including a round trip transfer from Airport.The hotel is very elegant but not to much opulent (which I don't like). In the lobby you may find an arcade with the most well known fashion brands, but , I don't know why, they are the 20% more expensive than Italy.The room is very nice and clean; you can undestand tha the hotel is very new. Big flat TV and very interesting control board for lighting and more from the bed table. Bathroom is not that big, but there is also a flat TV (never seen something like that).The location is ideal; clean and safe area walking distance to the shopping area and very close as well to the forbidden city and the markets.I would stay here without any doubt in the future."
139,117,"Aug 13 2006	A Palace it is and Staff at their best	My husband, 9 year old son and I stayed at the Peninsula Palace Hotel August 3 - 6, 2006. During that time they had a summer promotion on and you had to be crazy not to book it. For a five star hotel they deserve every one of those stars. The summer promotion included breakfast (buffet) everyday and it was quite the buffet - western and asian as well the option of dining in their 5 star restaurant JING that is known throughout the city or you could choose transfers to/from the airport your choice.The check in and bags to the room had to be in record time. Once inside the room they have unbelievable features, like when you enter the room you have the option of mood lights (when was the last time you went into a hotel room that had mood lights) doesn't work with a 9 year old. The plasma TV was amazing and you can order from a list of DVD's that are delivered to your room and there is no charge for this service. They have a sitting area as well as a desk with a fax machine and internet access to use of course if you are on business. The bathroom is quite large nice counter area, separate shower area, nice deep bathtub - phone right by the toilet and a tv screen in the bathroom really what more do you need. We weren't even on the club floor.My husband and I had a chance to use the fitness facilities if you work out this is the hotel to book. We have travelled a lot all over the world and this is the BEST hotel gym you could ask for it is big and has very good equipment. A lady also runs around with a basket after you and offers water and asks if you need anything - beats our local gym! For swimming which our 9 year old did the pool is more than enough fun - clean and big and very well maintained - it is indoors but they also have lounge chairs in case you want to sun yourself outside.. The conceirge is more than staffed - they speak many different languages and of course being the height of summer season especially for Asia they look after everyone - no job is too big or small for them. Including recommending shopping places for all the women that have empty suitcases. Dinner reservations are not a problem and if you want to go to the Beijing Opera you can book that as well. Local tours are offered with shuttle or bus pick up as well very specialized tours that need 24-48 hours notice - if we had had more time in Beijing we would definately booked the educational ones. I can't say enough about the conceirge they really look after you and I really couldn't tell at one point how many staff they had - one day there were six behind the desk looking after everyone what they don't want are lineups and believe me you don't have to wait. The hotel is surrounded by expensive shops on three floors ie Channel, Coach, Tiffany you get the idea - I saw people with bags but never actually saw anyone shopping in the stores - I know they must do well. So if you are humming or hawing where to stay i would highly recommend this hotel - you are in a stones throw of Wangfujing Street which is one of the MAIN shopping areas - like department stores, Olympic Souveniers an awesome Arts and Crafts Centre many floors high with all kinds of Crafts including the Jewellery section on the main floor. You can also walk to Tiananmen Square takes about 15 minutes but a cab is quick and cheap as well. The Peninsula used to be called the Palace Hotel and if you are reading an old guide to Beijing you might not see the hotel in your book - The Peninsula Chain bought it and of course changed the name what a great buy. It's more than a Palace!"
140,117,Aug 7 2006 	Excellent with a few grumbles!	Excellent with the following comments:- agree with previous reviewer re. price of Evian bottle. Had same experience but refused and sent it away.- booked a car and guide to the great wall. The guide just rides with you for the trip and stayed behind the walk on the wall. I don't understand the point of it and why we had to pay for a useless service.- both inhouse restaurants very good.
141,117,"Aug 7 2006 	Best hotel in Beijing	I've stayed at almost every 5 star hotel in Beijing but found Peninsula as the best in town (price/location/value). Travelled dozens of time to Beijing from 2004 through June 2006. Rooms are comfortable (love that TV in the bathroom), location is fantastic (don;t need to take a cab to go to restaurant /shopping/ foot massage). Personnel is very attentive, concierge desk is very efficient and helpful."
142,117,Jul 23 2006	Great Hotel - So-So Service	Stayed for seven days. Liked the room. Service on the Club level was fantastic. The entire staff was friendly and helpful during our morning breakfast and afternoon cocktails. They serve a very good &quot;free&quot; breakfast and evening buffet. The staff made us feel like honored guests day after day. I cannot say the same for the front desk and conciege. They acted as if we were a big bother. We actually were afraid to talk to the conciege after being talked down to and given one or two word answers to our questions. We were very lucky to find a local guide to give us recommendations - the conciege at this hotel was worthless. Front desk and money change desk were hard pressed to even say hello. Seemed like they just wanted to get you in and out. No smiles. Management needs to spend a day at the Peninsula Manila or Peninsula Chicago to understand what customer service is all about.
143,117,"Jul 18 2006	Good Hotel - Do not trust the Cocierge Recommendations	A great hotel - rooms, restauarants (especially Jing), ambience, and perfectly located to explore Beijing.Just one warning - do not trust the advice and recommendations of the Concierges. We booked an expensive city tour. The guide was excellent but she had been asked not to tell us beforehand that many of the sites were undergoing renovation and would be closed (improvements for the 2008 Olympics). We also asked for advice to get to one of the large Carrefour supermarkets and were directed to a very poor, older, smaller supermarket than the one requested. Restaurant recommendations? Not very experienced and it was as if they received a commission on recommending certain establishments.The Jing Restaurant was always very good .... especially the buffet.Beware of ordering certain items in the restaurants and cafes - a bottle of Evian cost GBP 8 so order the local mineral water. The tea and beer were very reasonable.A great hotel to stay in but ....."
144,117,"Jul 16 2006	NIce location and excelent conciege service	We stay in the hotel for 5 nights. The room was big enough to accommodate the 3 of us.As I made reservations by e-mail before, they wait for us at the airport with cool water and a Mercedes. They bring us to the hotel, and we went directly to the room (no check-in was necessary).A week before I communicate with the concierge by e-mail asking for suggestions, and asking for travel arrangements. When we arrived they have already book everything we want (private tours, shows, and restaurants). Everything works fine, and we are very happy with this and all other services of the hotel.On the top of all, the hotel is very well located, the breakfast is excellent, and has a very kind staff.For those that have never being in China before, and do not want to be part of an excursion it is a very good and safety option. I will do it again if it is necessary."
145,117,"Jul 8 2006	Executive Floor makes it best in China	We booked three rooms on the Executive level and received the best in service. One of the rooms did not have potable water, but we could call for as much bottled water as desired. The Club Lounge had an excellent breakfast buffet, superb afternoon tea snacks, and superb bar snacks and foods with drinks at happy hour. Our family loved the fitness center with the individual tvs, headphones, bottled water, and provided cool moist washcloths midway through the workout. Superb hotel laundry service. The location was superb for proximity to a pedestrian shopping street and a night market. Also close to a night food market."
146,117,"Jun 25 2006	Nothing Outstanding	Stayed at the Peninsula Palace for three nights towards the end of May. The room was standard size with a king-sized bed. The bed was a bit hard - especially given that most luxury hotels these days provide very comfortable beds. There is a big plasma tv in the room and another small one in the bathroom. I did not have the same problem as the other reviewer with regards to yellow water and leaking shower stall. Location of the hotel is very good - as it is close to many of the sights and a major shopping mall. What surprised me was the level of service at the hotel. I flew to Beijing from Shanghai where I stayed at the JW Marriott and I noticed the big difference in the level and consistency of service. At the Peninsula, they have excellent and knowledgable staff at the concierge, but the front desk staff was not too pleasant -- same with some of the page boys and door men, who are a bit aloof. There was even an occassion wherein the housekeeping staff left their wipe cloth in the room. Otherwise, service at the business centre and at the Jing restaurant was excellent."
147,117,"Jun 23 2006	It's better when you get inside!	The Peninsula Palace looks terrible from the outside, and the trip from the airport (by taxi) will leave you wishing that you'd never come to Beijing, but once inside it's a different matter.We arrived - nerves frazzled after the 100mph dash from the airport - in a far from relaxed state and as soon as we stepped out of the cab our bags were whisked away, we were taken up to the executive lounge and offered a beer. Good start!The concierge in the executive lounge couldn't have been more helpful, providing us with maps and information, and taking us personally to our room.Unfortunately, despite reserving a non-smoking room, the first room we were given smelt badly of smoke. No problem! We were given a choice of two other rooms and our bags were moved without any fuss or trouble.The rooms aren't overly opulent or fancy, and the views aren't good, but they're very clean, modern and comfortable.Location wise, the hotel is perfect for tourists. It literally is a 15 minute walk from the eastern edge of the Forbidden City (to the person who said in a previous post, &quot;don't believe the &quot;15-20 minute&quot; distance from the Forbidden Palace/Tiananmen Square you hear&quot; - I think you must have got lost - you go out of the hotel, turn left and walk in a straight line for 15 minutes!!!). It's 2 mins from the main shopping street (which is good to look at but not great for shopping) and right across the road from the most amazing foot massage place we've ever experienced (amazing after a day trekking round the city).We were going to go on a trip to the Great Wall arranged by a youth hostel but it was too much hassle, so we asked the concierge to organise a car to take us to Jinshanling and pick us up at Simatai. They also provided us with a great lunch. This was not cheap, but it was worth the money for the experience.Overall - a good hotel in a good location and perfect if you're only in Beijing for a short time to &quot;see the sights&quot;."
148,117,"May 25 2006	Good Hotel	In the past I have only stayed at the Peninsual's in Bangkok (possibly the world's best hotel) and the Hong Kong Pen (an institution) so we were expecting an equally grand hotel. We arrived late and their car met us at the airport. All very standard stuff for most of Asia. Arriving at the hotel we had booed into the club floor.They take you directly to your room. A disappointment, to say the least. Tiny rooms and even smaller bathrooms in comparison with their other Asia hotels. So we had them locate another room, and negotited a small extra amount to pay. Much better. At least we could unpack and move around without too much problem. And a bigger bathroom too. The club floor had a pretty good breakfast. They will go out of their way and make you eggs to your choosing if you ask them nicely. The staff were all very helpful. They put on a snack and cakes in the afternoon. Chocolates after dinner, so it's not a bad place to retire to before bed. Free internet service as well. The restaurant is excellent and the breakfast there is huge. One day we hired a car and driver to take us to the Great Wall. The restaurant maitre d' ( a delightful ladt with an excellent command of english) assisted us in haveing a picnic lunch packed., We chose food from the cold food buffet the night before in containers she provided and kept them in the kitchen fridge. The next morning they packed it in a small ice chest and provided us with linen and plates and cutlery so we could enjoy the meal. At the Great Wall our driver took us to a gift shop at the bottom and waited with the food while we spent a few hours on the Wall. We then ate at one of their tables. This was much nicer than the restaurants we passed on the way.The hotel is located close tt Tiamen Square and the Forbidden City (about 25 minutes walk) and next to a huge car free mall. We enjoyed the hotel. Excellent staff. Super Chinese restaurant in it too."
149,117,"May 24 2006	Very good hotel but spotty service	My partner and I stayed at the Beijing Peninsula Palace hotel in mid-January and would recommend it to others who seek acceptable luxury in Beijing.ROOMOur room was a deluxe room, but take note that not all deluxe room are created equal. Our first room was much smaller and did not have a TV in the bathroom. We complained and were given a larger room in the same category on a higher floor. This room had a separate &quot;office&quot; area tucked into a corner of the room. It had a silent fax machine, broadband access and the usual Peninsula technologies. The bed itself was not to hard, and it was prepared for us nightly. I'm not sure however that they changed the sheets every day. BATHROOMThe bathroom didn't have a separate shower cubicle. Our bath's sliding glass door leaked quite a lot of water and the water pressure while adequate, wasn't that strong. Oh, and do remember to let the water run from all the faucets for five minutes. China being a Third World country, doesn't have good piping so the water is yellow. They do have a separate faucet which dispenses potable (clear) water.FACILITIESThe hotel itself was quite luxurious on the exterior. We used the pool area, the sauna and the gym - All were top class. We dined at Huang Hing restaurant (very good) and had daily buffet breakfast at Jing (also very good in quality and choice). SERVICEMy only main gripe is that the service of the hotel was spotty! We arrived late in the evening and while the staff were attentive, their tone was rude at times. The front desk lady actually said, &quot;OK, that's it! You can go!&quot; when she gave us our key - I was hoping that the management could have trained their staff to avoid the famous Chinese &quot;no-nonsense&quot; (i.e. rude by Western standards) mannerisms and word choice. The service in Jing was also spotty - We asked for Jasmine tea every day and it was either late in arriving, or was forgotten altogether. In terms of cleanliness, we noticed a lot of fingerprints on the mirrors and table tops throughout the hotel. Again, this is a minor issue but unacceptable in this type of hotel category.SURROUNDINGSFinally, as for the surroundings of the hotel, don't believe the &quot;15-20 minute&quot; distance from the Forbidden Palace/Tiananmen Square you hear. My partner and I are avid walkers and it took us a good 35 minutes to get to those mentioned locations. The hotel itself is in a nice shopping area however, and the CONCLUSIONOverall, this is a very good hotel. Perhaps, as an expat residing in ultra-high service and ultra-polite Japan, I'm more aware of the small service details. As such, don't expect the exact same type of service you're used to from back home. I'm sure that in time, the level of service will improve once China develops further."
150,117,"May 15 2006	Beautiful Hotel! Too bad our new Levi's were stolen from it!	We were pleasantly surprised that we were staying in the nicest and most beautiful Hotel in Beijing. Clean, wonderful breakfast buffet, good service, robe and slippers provided. The only thing negative we went home with, was the realization that levi jeans must be very valuable because my husbands were taken from the room. He left them folded on the entertainment stand and they were gone when we returned. Otherwise, we loved the Hotel."
151,117,May 8 2006	Very nice place to stay	I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The staff was very pleasant and always eager to accomodate. The hotel was very well maintained. The food was excellent. It was nicer than most places I have stayed in New York- and the people were a whole lot friendlier. I would definitely go back
152,117,"May 6 2006	A bit of an enigma	In many ways this hotel is superb: the facilities are terrific e.g. a very fine gym and nice indoor pool. Rooms have excellent plasma TVs and fine showers. The &quot;club floor&quot; lounge is very welcoming, doing breakfast but also afternoon tea and complementary drinks in the early evening. Service was excellent throughout in my experience, helpful and freindly. Oddly, the breakfast was patchy, with eggs cooked to order, but cold baked beans, tea that was also sometimes cold, and some very ordinary dim sum indeed. At peak times, there was a long line for breakfast; we waited 20 minutes one day to get into the dining room (which is one level below the lobby). However the main problem was the beds, which had rock-hard matresses. According to my physician wife, it is a myth that hard beds are good for your back, and these were the hardest I can recall in all my travels. Overall, very good, but if you have any trouble with hard beds, look elsewhere."
153,117,May 2 2006	Heaven in Beijing	The moment we arrived we were wisked away to our upgraded duplex suite. It was a stunning room with magnificent lighting. We were greeted with beautiful fresh fruit and a display of cookies and chocolate. The service was perfect. The concierge arranged every detail of our 5 night stay from front row opera tickets to a window table at the Courtyard restaurant.We took the hotel transfer service to the airport which included a personal escort to our ticket counter. Since we were not traveling with a tour the personal service we received during our entire stay made our trip to Beijing memorable. I wouldn't hesitate staying at the elegant Peninsula again... I would look forward to it.
154,117,"May 2 2006	very good	Stayed for 4 nights in March, great limo service which picks up from the airport if you pre book it 60 each way. The hotel is very chic, the foyer is amazing, surrounded by many designer shops, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior, Prada, Tiffanys and many more. The prices of the restaurants were steep by Beijing standards. But if you don't mind the prices then the quality of the restaurants is very good, particularly the Cantonese restaurant.The hotel is very well located, a 5 minute walk to the shops but a good 15 mins to the Square and Forbidden City. I suggest getting cabs as they are very very cheap, get the concierge desk to sort them out for you, they are very helpful.We got the hotel to organise a trip to the Great Wall and Qing Tomb for us with a Red Star car. It was very good, get a packed lunch from the hotel to take with you. The standard room was very nice, plasma screen, all fittings new and shiny. Wasn't the biggest room I have ever stayed in but more than big enough. The bed was one of the best I have ever slept in and the sheets were lovely and soft.I would recommend the hotel to anyone going to Beijing, not the cheapest but certainly very good quality, chic, reliable and central. Beijing itself is worth a visit, especially the Great Wall, an experience i will never forget. The Silk Market is the place to go for bargain shopping, once you get used the hassle from each stall holder you realise that its just their sales pitch and isn't meant to feel as intimidating as it does at first. Some fantastic bargains to be had, my girlfriend said she would go back to Beijing just for that market!"
155,117,"Apr 23 2006 	Ok But Will Go Elsewhere When Next in Beijing	I had heard raving reviews of the Peninsula Hotel Beijing, but I was disappointed. For US $300, I did not think this belongs in the 5 Star category. There is nothing special about the lobby, although the hotel is located in a mall with all the shopping of brand names on Rodeo Drive or 5th Avenue. The location was what bothered me. My wife and I walked several blocks in all directions, but there was nothing interesting to see, even along the nearby pedestrian street. The dining room is in the basement, but although pleasant, it lacked natural sunlight. Food was plentiful and good for breakfast and dinner. The room was of appropriate size and had a plasma tv, and was well decorated. Internet connection was superb, and free. Lots of Westerners stayed at the hotel too. This was my 3rd trip to Beijing, and I will choose another hotel next time."
156,117,"Mar 6 2006	Good but a few mis-steps.	Stayed there eight days in February. Overall experience was fine, with the exception of a few service hiccups. Rooms are more than adequate; the breakfast buffet is terrific, especially the Asian side; and the restaurant, while pricey, is quite good. Location is terrific. Generally, service is fine, but sometimes spotty at the concierge desk. Asked them to make reservations for Peking Opera one night, and they told me they would. Got to the opera, none had been made. Raised the issue when I returned, was told they would look into it and get back to me. No one did. When we reserved, we received a questionnaire asking our preference in newspaper, we never got one. Asked whether we would like comforter or blanket, we said blanket, got a comforter. Quite fine hotel, but doesn't quite live up to the promise of the Rolls Royce out front. Given the language barrier, it lhelps to be very specific."
157,117,"Mar 1 2006	Excellent Hotel	My wife and I stayed 5 nights departing 2/28. Overall this is a wonderful hotel. The buffet breakfast is outstanding. Service was above average. Free internet service is provided in each room, both wifi and wired (connect speed sometimes is slow). Gym is very nice.The only negatives, which I do not consider serious were that the outside look of the hotel is nothing to write home about, and the room was a little small. Location is good, about a 15 minute walk to Tianamen Square. Many restuarants in the area. Pedestrian shopping street is a 5 minute walk."
158,117,"Feb 26 2006	Great ammenities!	Just came back from an eventful trip to Beijing with my family. I must say that our vacation was enhanced by choosing the Peninsula. After exciting and often tiring days sightseeing with children, it was refreshing to return to 5 star accomadations. However, I don't believe that the service was always 5 star. I don't feel that it was for lack of trying but more of not knowing. Beijing is still growing as an international city and I believe that the more exposure they have in the service industry, the more they will be acccustomed to the needs of the travellers.."
159,117,"Feb 25 2006	What a great experience!	I stayed at this property Feb. 8 - 14, 2006. Couldn't have been more pleased with the room, great shower in the bathroom, service, location and overall experience. The breakfast buffet served at Jing each morning was something to look forward too. I also enjoyed the best massage I've ever had at the Peninsula spa. First rate! Also check out the small, very good restaurant right across the street."
160,117,"Jan 16 2006 	This is a quite overrated Hotel	Having stayed at this hotel twice on my trip, i think this is a overated hotel. Probably one of the best in Beijing, not in this world.The room is simply Too Small. At an average of 31 metres, if you have more than one big suitcase, it is hard to put down two at the sametime. There is lots of details in the room ( like big TV etc). The Bath room is Tiny, compared to the Peninsula Bangkok.Since their Tub&amp;Shower is in one place, my shower cracked the first time i used. I switched to China World Hotel on my third night stay there. Room at China World Hotel is much more spacious, a bit more expensive of than that of Peninsula BJ, but worth it.The location of the hotel is excellent, restauant at ground Fl is good."
161,117,"Jan 11 2006	5 star luxury	For luxurious attention to detail this has to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!The rooms are elegant - oh so comfy bed, Egyptian cotton sheets and lots of pillows. A beautiful limestone bathroom that even had an adjustable plasma screen tv you could watch in the bath.Room service was excellent as was the food in the restaurants. Staff very helpful. Taxis sometimes a little difficult to get hold of as they don't have a taxi rank on site.Word of advice - some American and European visitors might find the many porters ringing on the door - offering ice, chocolates for your pillow etc - a little annoying just remember to light up your 'do not disturb'on the control panel if you want to be left alone."
162,117,"Jan 2 2006	Wonderful Experience	This hotel was amazing - we stayed for 3 nights. The room was elegant yet comfortable. We paid a little more for the club level, but it was well worth it. Also, the hotel's spa was small, but we each had relaxing and affordable massages, which were nice after a long day of travel. Don't hesitate to stay here."
163,117,"Dec 5 2005	A Comfortable Elegant Home Base While Staying in Beijing	My husband and I stayed at the Peninsula for 4 wonderful nights. We read so many wonderful reviews about the hotel and couldn't wait to experience the hotel for ourselves; we were not disappointed at all!We loved the comfortable bed and oversized towels. It was such a treat to return back from a long day of sightseeing and have our bed turned down with ornemental pillows carefully slipped in their cases, slippers on each side of the bed, bottled water at the bedside, and soft music playing. The breakfasts at Jing restaurant were wonderful complete with a vast array of fruit, pastries, breakfast meats and they will cook your eggs to order.Service was outstanding and this hotel definately deserves the 5 star rating."
164,117,"Dec 3 2005	One of the top hotels in China	I stayed at the Peninsula Palace earlier this year and it was great although service could be better.Location: I always thought it is adjacent to Wangfujing from the maps, but in reality you have to walk few minutes to reach it, and yet another few minutes to reach Oriental Plaza. From this point, the Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City is another 5-10 minutes walk. If location is paramount, the Grand Hyatt is better as it sits atop Oriental Plaza. The China World is also conveniently located atop World Trade Center with great shopping Center (and ice skating rink).Lobby: Opulent and grand with dramatic atrium and white carrara grand staircase leading to either business centre &amp; ballroom upstairs or the impressive collection of luxury boutiques and restaurants downstair.Service: Check in was swift, where I was escorted right up to my room, which is quite personal considering the size of the hotel (500 plus rooms). Concierge, however, was a bit of let down. I requested a simple task to re-confirm my airline ticket to Jakarta but they could not find the phone number / location of the airlines office in Beijing. They made several attempts to call the Hong Kong and Shanghai office, but I was told to wait. I even asked them to check the net for the address, but still no result The next day, I followed it up but still yet to be confirmed. At the end, I went up to the business Center and rent it's 15 minutes internet for 30RMB and found the phone details myself, give it to the concierge and straight away got it confirmed.You can rent DVD for free from a list of options. Mine took more than half an hour and a few calls to get it delivered.Rooms: There are no impressive views from the hotel. The Deluxe rooms (31 sq.m) are located on the sides (possibly could have distant view to the forbidden City from top floors). The Grand Deluxe rooms (34sq.m) face either the main entrance or the indoor pool on the podium with distant view towards Chang An avenue. Opt for Grand Deluxe rooms as they have larger bathroom with separate shower and bath and TV.Rooms are not as large (e.g Grand Hyatt Shanghai 40m2, Island Shangri-La HK 44m2, Ritz Carlton Singapore 50m2), but they are superbly furnished. Teak wood with rugs, mood lighting, comfortable sofas, plasma tv, personal fax machine, DVD players with some music CDs selection and great control panel by the bed.Bath: Grand Deluxe bathrooms are large, with small TV by the vanity and control panels by the tub. Bath amenities are not great, nor are they designer brand as with other top hotels. Restaurant: My rates include a buffet breakfast at Jing, which is located at the basement. Although it has no view / street frontage, it is still feel very cozy. The design is great especially the private rooms. The breakfast food is allright, but not superb: quantity is not great but has good quality.Facilities: Check out the 50 luxury boutiques (from LV, Gucci, Prada, Tiffany) which can be handy for shopaholics. The pool was closed at that time, but should be nice with glass skylight when open.Rates: When booking the hotel, should check out directly to the hotel's website as sometimes they have good bargain with rates down to USD 160, incl. bfast (rack rates are USD 340)."
165,117,"Nov 29 2005 	Great Stay at the Peninsula Palace	I just returned from a six night stay at the Peninsula Palace Hotel in Beijing. The hotel is nicely located, a few blocks away from the Wangfujing shopping district and a 20-30 minute walk from the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square.The hotel has excellent facilities including a pool / fitness center, a shopping mall in the basement, good room service, and a spectacular restaurant  Huang Ting. I stayed at this hotel for business and had a grand deluxe room on the club level. The club level rooms are about $50/night more expensive than the regular rooms but they include free breakfast, afternoon tea / desserts, and evening snacks in the 13th floor club lounge. Drinks, Internet access, and clothes pressing are also free and, in my opinion, round out a worthwhile upgrade from the regular rooms. My biggest gripe with the club level is the lack of authentic Chinese food and snacks  almost everything provided was too Americanized.The best feature of the hotel is probably the rooms with all their extravagant gadgets and amenities including a flat panel TV in both the bedroom and the bathroom, and a control panel next to the bed that controls everything from the TV and radio to the temperature and mood lighting. The control panel seems to have a motion detector built in so the lights on the display turn on as you move your hand closerneat.If you dont speak Chinese it is useful to have a card to hand to taxi drivers that identifies your destination in Chinese characters. The concierge at the Peninsula Palace has some of these with popular destinations printed on them. Interestingly, the cards dont include the airport as a popular destination (the one place almost every visitor would need to go eventually!). My theory is that this is because the hotel is more than happy to arrange one of their comfortable but pricey limos for this service. Even if you do take a taxi, the doorman knows to call the more expensive 2.00 yuan/km rides over the standard 1.60 yuan/km onesvery clever. A few tips from my stay:1. Single men should be prepared to be approached about 50 times between the hotel and the Forbidden city by young women pretending to study English or just looking for fun;2. Do visit the weekend market to buy some quality arts and crafts at low prices;3. Dont wear shorts regardless of the weather  it is bad form  I can count on one hand the number of people I saw wearing shorts in Beijing over a one week period (all misinformed tourists); and4. Dont buy things from government-run Friendship stores or jade/jewelry factories included in itineraries to the Great Wall unless you enjoy paying 10X too much for merchandise. Even the trips organized by the Peninsula Palace include these annoying stops.Overall, I would certainly consider staying here again, but next time I might try the Grand Hyatt just to sample some of Beijings other hotels. The Grand Hyatt looks very nice and is located at Oriental Plaza, slightly closer to the Forbidden City and the subway."
166,117,"Nov 25 2005	Above Average Hotel	Stayed for three nights in June 2005. Slightly overrated. While the rooms were clean and modern (plasma t.v., purified water in the bathroom), they are very small. Hotel guests are mostly white Americans, not that that is a bad thing but being in the hotel, you would never know you were in China (except for the staff). Great location, excellent service, clean/modern facilities, good Western-style restuarant for buffet breakfast, luxury shopping within the hotel."
167,117,"Nov 24 2005	Fantastic hotel	I stayed in this hotel with my family for a few nights in September 2005. We were upgraded so we got fabulous rooms that were really spacious with plasma screens including one in the bathroom. I liked the way every night when I came back from a tough days sightseeing there was classical music playing in the room. The food was fantastic there, especially the breakfasts. Ate in both restaurants there and can recommend the Hua Ting, try the duck pancakes, but beware you get a lot of duck!The locatin was perfect, you could just stroll down to wangfujing for shopping. I would definitely stay there again if i was in Beijing."
168,117,"Nov 12 2005 	Surrounding Areas less than to be desired	What do you do if your husband gets a major chronic back pain, which leaves him bedridden for 2 full days, whereupon he asks me, his wife, for one of those &quot;Tibetan Pads&quot; to stick on his back?Of course I go get it, after I had a nice lunch on the LL1 floor of Jing Restaurant with one of my best friends...So I ask Marie, the concierge, where she can get me Chinese medicine pads and she gladly pointed out a Pharmacy, which is about a brisk 14 minute walk to get to. After checking on the cell phone with my ailing husband, I knew I got the right pads in a shop filled with all kinds of boxes of medicines. Tonight I pack to check out of the Peninsula Palace in Beijing tomorrow morning. I note how amazing this hotel's service has been: the room service, the house keeping, the waiting staff at the restaurants. (Hua Ting, on LL 2 is very good Chinese fare. Order cold appetizer/salads. )Then I go through my receipts to find the pharmacy overcharged me by 13 more pads! Unbelievable! I hear Wang Fu Jing is a cheating neighborhood for tourists, but this is just too much! WATCH YOURSELF IN THIS AREA! (If you won't buy anything, then don't worry so much. This is a great hotel. The lobby's upscale mall has decent window dressing compared to others in Beijing.)"
169,117,"Nov 11 2005 	Believe the hype about this one!	My weeklong stay at the Peninsula Palace was fantastic from start to finish. They sent a questionnaire beforehand asking about bed, refreshment, and newspaper preferences, so when I got there my room had the requested amenities. The location is fantastic, close to shopping, two subway stops, the Forbidden City and Tianamen Square. The room was superb, luxury linens and towels, a bedside control for literally everything in the room, including a 42 inch flat screen TV. It was very quiet, a nice respite from the hectic traffic (and unbelievably polluted air) outside.Compared to many four star hotels in the city, this property is pretty expensive, but less than the Hyatt and the St. Regis. I opted for the club floor for an extra $30 a night. I guess it was worth it, because the onsite restaurants were quite pricey (but it was nice that room service cost the same price for a selection of the same dishes). The selection at breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails was rather limited. But there is a nice lounge with internet access and free beverages all day.I would definitely stay at this property again!"
170,117,"Oct 28 2005	Excellent	First class hotel 10 minutes walk from Forbidden City and five minutes from main pedestrian shopping street. Decent size room, with 2 plasma TV's (one in bathroom). No views worth mentioning. Fine service overall. Concierge will book Great Wall and other tours (not cheap). Our Great Wall-Ming Tombs guide spoke excellent English. Terrific breakfast buffet included in room price. Would highly recommend this hotel. Fairly priced."
171,117,"Oct 28 2005	Worth the money!	A treat at a true 5 star hotel. We noticed the difference the moment upon arrival. A representative escorted us to the front desk including an offer to carry my business case. Then the front desk staff who checked us in personally took us to our room and explain how every ammentiity works in the room. The hotel also make every effort to accomodate our special requests. Room is very contemporary with marble tiles and hard wood floor and a large plasma TV including state of the art electronic control on all electrical appliances. Central air is efficient and quiet which is uncommon. One feature that one would appreciate in China is that it come with filtered water at the sink rather than just bottled water. Hotel location is great. The Jing Restaurant was great for breakfast. All staff are friendly and helpful leaving you with a personal touch . We used the business center for internet bottled water was provided while we surf. Upon checked out when a private car was waiting to take us to the airport, the hotel manager would personal come over and inform us personally and ensure even our our departure exxperience was a pleasant one."
172,117,"Oct 22 2005 	Great location beautiful rooms excellent service	As a travel agent, I stay in many hotels each year. The Peninsula Palace is one of the best. The group I brought to China loved this hotel. The location is excellent for shopping and sightseeing, right in the center of the city. Be careful of luxury hotels (or any hotels) in Beijing. The city is huge and the traffic awful. You can stay at a great hotel in the city that is half an hour or more from the Forbidden City. Our room was beautifully furnished and quite soothing. Room amenities were amongst the best I have ever encountered. Make sure you get the turn-down service - it makes going to bed a special experience. A hotel such as this in New York or London would cost twice the price. Go to China and take advantage of fabulous hotels at remarkable rates."
173,117,"Oct 19 2005	Great spot for 5 star luxury in Beijing	This was our 2nd stay at Peninsula Palace and it remains a favorite. We were in a Duplex Suite on the 14th floor. It was FABULOUS. Huge, 2 story suite. Ground floor had half bath, living &amp; dining area, flat screen TV. Hit a button and the drapes open/close on the 2 story windows. Stairs to 2nd floor loft style space. Huge desk &amp; work area, large bed, another flat screen and loads of storage space for clothes, etc. Bathroom was big with 2 sink areas and yet another TV in the wall at the end of the tub.Service was excellent. Shoes shined &amp; returned almost instantly. Room service was quick &amp; good. Duplex Suites are on Club Room Floor and the Club Lounge (on 13th Floor) was lovely. Easy service in checking in/out and huge breakfast, afternoon snack &amp; evening cocktail spreads. Very comfortable. Only complaint would be that they only had 1 computer to use for internet, etc. and it was busy a lot (However, there was a business center on 2nd floor). Location is excelllent. Walk out the door, down the street and you are on a huge pedestrian street filled with shopping. In the evenings, there's a great food stall market...go to see the crickets/silkworms, etc. on a stick! Easy 20 minute walk to Tiananmen Square/Forbidden City. If you're looking for luxury...we thought Peninsula Palace was far better for the price than St. Regis."
174,117,"Sep 27 2005	REALLY GREAT PLACE TO STAY	We stayed on the exec floor (13th) and got a reasonable rate through a club. You will pay more for this hotel, but the location and staff are both excellent. No need to take hotel taxis, especially to airport, as Beijing Taxis are cheap and effificient. Many many things within walking distance of hotel. Do check out the breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour on the executive floor. We never ordered room service given these options for free;)"
175,117,"Sep 4 2005 	Nice hotel but not GRAND	I stayed there 5 nights and enjoyed my stay. But it was not what I would call an exciting 4 or 5 star hotel. There were several problems and the hotel staff only corrected the problem and did nothing extra. When I arrived, I was escorted to my room which was great because the door lock was broken. I was told they would fix the door and told it was take half a day and come back. I was offered nothing in return. I then told them to give me another room but everything was sold out. I was told a better room was available the next day, so I booked it and I paid the higher price. The second room had a much larger and nicer bathroom, but not to the level of other top 5 star hotels. The first room looked very basic. The lobby is nothing to get excited about. The entrance to the hotel is nothing to get excited about. But, in the lobby and 2 floors below the lobby is a mini shopping mall with every major luxury brand store. And these stores are not the usual hotel mini version, the are full size. That was surprising since they seemed to be empty everytime I walked by. Over all I enjoyed my stay. Both rooms were on opposites sides of the building, so I got to see the main road view and the pool side view. Neither are what I would call impressive. So don't go there for the views! The hotel staff were nice. When I came back late on my second day to move to my new room, a staff attendant noticed me enter the lobby and immediately told me my new room was ready. That was impressive. I guess she waited there all day? The location is great. I was not so impressed to stay there automatically on my next trip. I booked this hotel because I saw it was rated #1 by internet users. But I would say it's a nice hotel, but not GRAND. I walked to the Hyatt and that hotel looked impressive from the &quot;outside&quot;. So I will probably try there next time."
176,117,"Aug 26 2005	Hotel of Supreme Harmony	My husband and I stayed for 8 nights in this superb hotel. We had booked a Duplex suite but were upgraded to the Beijing suite when we arrived. I had been in contact with the hotel before our arrival to ensure our booking had been received and to tell them about our anniversary which was to take place whilst we were there. This appeared to be a good move as the lady I had communicated with acted as a personal concierge whilst we were there and we received a complimentary bottle of champagne on our anniversary, (this may also have been because we were staying in a suite of course).The hotel is very grand. It is spotlessly clean and has an impressive lobby area complete with sweeping staircase and a fine array of designer shops. The receptionists are helpful and courteous and we did not have to wait long for attention even at busy times.Our suite was beautiful. It consisted of lounge, dining area, office area, bedroom, bathroom with his and hers sinks, and a separate toilet. There was a plasma screen in the lounge and in the bedroom, and the bath had a LCD TV at the foot which was fully controllable via easily-reachable buttons at the side of the bath. There were far more channels available than I had been told to expect, e.g. BBC World News and three film channels. The air conditioning was excellent and the complimentary toiletries were of good quality. The minibar, was well stocked; a beer was about 35 RMB (which is about 2.20) which is not the end of the world. I particularly liked the 'mood lighting' available, very romantic! The hotel has its own restaurants, which is handy as China is quite a difficult place if you don't speak Chinese and don't particularly wish to sample the locals' food. The Jinn restaurant is where breakfast is served and we found it to be of superb quality. You could literally have anything you wanted - cereals, full English, omelettes, pancakes, fresh fruit or Chinese. At busy times, 8am to 9am, it gets very busy and you may have to wait for a table but it is not too painful and everyone is very courteous. In the evening the Jinn restaurant serves 'Fusion' food which, to my mind, means Western-style Chinese food that isn't very Chinese at all. Try the duck pancakes, oh try them please!!! My mouth still waters at the very thought. The other restaurant we visited in the hotel was the Hong Qiou which serves more traditional Chinese food; you can even have Shark's fin if you want to pay the ridiculous price! We went for the safe option and had sweet and sour pork, duck, beef with mushrooms, noodles etc. This too was fabulous and honestly not very expensive. A word of advice...if you order tea don't order water as well. We made this mistake without realising that they will keep topping up the tea indefinitely and so we ended up with tea, water and beer!If you have had a tiring day the other option is room service. We had this a couple of times and were never dissappointed. If you are missing your burger and don't like McDonalds after watching 'Supersize me' (I still can't get the non-decaying fries out of my mind), then room service does the most delicious burger ever...mmmmmm burger. Just make sure that you remember that all prices are subject to a 15% Service charge which we still can't work out, particularly when they then leave a space on the bill for 'tip'.As part of our package we had access to the club lounge. We found this area invaluable. You can have breakfast here but it is far more limited than the Jinn restaurant. In the afternoon they serve the most delicious scones with cream and jam and other fancy little sweet things, so vital for the ladies after a long morning haggling in the market! In the evening they have a small buffet of meats, cheese and tacos. You can also help yourself to alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. We found the club really great before and after having a meal in the hotel. We had drinks in the Lobby bar on our anniversary and gulped at the bill when we could have had complimentary drinks in the club!The location of this hotel is ideal. It is right by the Wangfujing shopping precinct and either a walk or a very short and cheap (70p) taxi ride to the Forbidden City and Tianeman Square. Taxis are extremely easy to get right outside the hotel lobby and are cheap and reliable. The hotel organised a Hutong tour for us and a hotel taxi to the Summer Palace and Great Wall. Although far more expensive than if you organise it yourself I suspect it was well worth the extra money, our taxi driver actually showed us around the Summer Palace like our own personal guide.All in all an amazing experience that I would love everyone to share."
177,117,"Aug 21 2005	The best hotel i have ever stayed	Best facilities, best services, best value. We will definitely stay here again."
178,117,"Aug 2 2005	Wow absolutely amazing am so impressed!	I can tell you I was so looking forward to staying here after looking at their website and the comments left here. Can I assure everyone out there that this hotel is brilliant! They really think of everything, and once you step out of the taxi pulling up at the hotel you really dont need to worry about anything at all.I was in a Deluxe Room registered with the CLub Lounge so I had access to free food and drinks all day and they have a great afternoon tea bit between 3-5pm where they serve the most delicious chocolate cakes and pastries, everything complimentary, inc internet usage. I would well recommend it!Breakfast was very good too with a really wide selection, inc smoked salmon, parma ham, a full english and American breakfast and asian dimsum too with teriyaki fish, mmmmmmmm.Now one of the best bits was how modern the room was itself. Its a reasonable size with 2 double beds, and a massive plasma screen in it and also a smaller one in the bathroom where you can watch dvds/tv in the bath, which I did, how pampered was I! Plus they have all these controls by the bed so you really dont have to move! They have around 100 dvds you can choose from but th annoying thing is alot of them are hired out and you dont have to return them until you check out, so ended up watching some knockoff dvds I bought in a subway which also worked fine.If you want your room made up you press a button 'make up my room' and then a maid comes from housekeeping in literally a couple of minutes. My only gripe is that when it came to getting a taxi back to the airport they called a rather expensive black one and not a normal taxi, and this one didnt have a meter in it and charged us 120 yuan whereas to get to beijing from the airport only cost me 70 yuan in a metered taxi! so next time before you hop in, check its got a meter!Otherwise I cannot recommed this hotel enough. Its location is fab too, its about 5 min walk from Wangfujing st, just go out of the hotel and turn left and walk 5 mins and Wangfujing is on your left."
179,117,"Jul 18 2005	The best I've ever stayed	staff, service, facilities... A wonderful place to stay and rest. Do not hesitate, it's worth the money..."
180,117,"Jul 12 2005	Wonderful respite at a decent price	Stayed here for a night of luxury after a month of backpacking - for a promotional rate of only $145! The DVD selection and the plasma TVs were a nice touch, and the staff is very helpful. I do have to agree with the previous comment about the taxi hotel service - you're better off catching one on the street on your own."
181,117,"Jul 11 2005	The Beiing Peninsula er...Palace	I've got to concur with a previous review that while the Beijing Pen is pretty good-it does pale in comparison with its namesake in Hongkong or Manila. I was so ready to be wowed at first glance; I suppose my expectations were over-reaching upon arrival. For starters, it is not an easy walk to the Forbidden City--it's a good 25 minute romp. Nevertheless, the front desk was most accomodating, giving me a choice for another room when I requested for one with a better view. Some literature might lead you to believe you'll get one with a view of the Forbidden City--most doubtful as the hotel is around the bend.The plasma tv's were excellent and the dvd/cd players were thoughtfully bedecked with 2 cd's, one jazz the other chinese classical--I thought these were excellent ideas. And as for the bathroom with flat screen tv's...now you'll really stay in the tub for hours.As for the food--Huang Ting was good and quite beautiful. Jing for breakfast was alright...a bit jammed with people, all lined up along the egg station...nothing gets the caucasian crowd rousing and bitchin like making them wait for their eggs. Jing for dinner, with all due respect to the Conde Nast list--was a bit of a disappointment.Still, everything else in this hotel is mighty spiffy--from the front desk, to the lovely shopping halls, to the gym, swimming pools and steam rooms...the Beijing Peninsula is excellent...I'm just not sure if it's really deserves to be called a PALACE. PS: Make sure you check out the Wangfujin map they unwittingly hide in the desk--outlining all the little pocket pleasures you'll find in the neighborhood."
182,117,"Jun 27 2005	Excellent Hotel Stay	Excellent hotel. Service was great. From the time of check-in we were whisked to the club level where we were served drinks &amp; snacks while they processed our check-in. Anything we asked was done promptly. They try to meet your every need. The entire staff was extremely friendly. I was impressed how ell they spoke English. Workout facilities &amp; pool were very nice.I thought the Huang Ting restaurant was outstanding. Many peolple rave about Jing, but our meal there was only so-so. The only negative thing was the hotel taxi service. It was considerably more expensive than the regulat taxi. Having said that its a small negative.My family is still talking about our hotel stay there. We think this is the PLACE TO STAY in Beijing."
183,117,Jun 15 2005	Great Hotel!	The staff at this Hotel are very nice and always willing to help. The buffet is to die for. It was so nice to come back to after a busy day of site seeing!
184,117,"Jun 2 2005	This Ain't the JW Shanghai...	This is a solid hotel. Whether it is up there with the cream of the crop in the 5 star family of luxury/premier hotels is debatable - think the flagship Peninsula HK, the Ritz Carlton, JW Marriott and Grand Hyatt in Shanghai, the Oriental &amp; Regent in Bangkok. I am not thinking the Peninsula Palace Beijing.My comments are minor 1s but when the barometer of comparision is set by such outstanding properties as those noted above, they are noticeable. Staff to guest ratio was good but nothing out of the ordinary, always had to wait for cabs, the concierges seemed overwhelmed at times, construction around the building started at 7am each morning so one had no choice but to get up (&amp; could also not take an afternoon nap), the drainage in the bathroom was like my old college dorm room. Again, nothing severe but chinks in the armour of any 5 star contender. Huang Ting / Chinese rest. was excellent - both quality &amp; value wise. Conversation-interrupting Peking duck. I have to stop thinking about the duck now... I also went to the famous Peking duck rest. on the busy street behind T. Sq / Mao's maus. that every guidebook &amp;/or mag/newspaper articles mentions (I think opened since the late 1800s). It's ok. But so is a Toyota Camry &amp; if i can pay the same price I'd rather have the Lexus. You pay the same amount but the quality of the duck &amp; the service cannot be compared without tempting ridicule from little children. Zing, the other rest., is where breakfast is served - as the other reviews on this site note, excellent. Lots of choice - from western food to dim sum. Gets busy in the rush hour morning traffic though (seems to be a lot of tour groups at this hotel). However, the rest. is also highly rated for it's dinners (Conde Nast ranked i think) - my sis tried it out for dinner but she has yet to give me the thumbs up or down. Conclusion: if you can get a decent rate, go for it. Otherwise, you may want to check out the Hyatt (connected to the Oriental Plaza - great food court here!)"
185,117,"May 20 2005	Stay Here	What can I say but fabulous, this hotel have got it right. The moment we walked into foyer we were treated wonderfully. We travelled all over China, and we also have travelled most of the world, but I have to say that this hotel has the best breakfast buffet I have ever seen. The rooms were wonderful and exceptionally clean.I cannot praise this hotel or Beijing enough. I am returning in September and would never stay anywere else.Stay here with the greatest of confidence."
186,117,"May 4 2005 	Truly magnificent. A real 5 stars for a very reasonable price	Extremely well situated, walking distance from the Forbidden City and Tienanmen Place. Luxurious hotel, with a mix of traditional with modern. Splendid decor. Room and bathrrom of a real 5 stars. Restaurant facilities outstanding from breakfast to supper whether in the Jing or the Huang Ting where we ate a most delicious Peking duck ( we even had it on 2 different occasions!) Impeccable service, from registration in your own bedroom, to first class conciergerie service . Most polite staff doing their best to accomodate you in all aspect of the stay. Were driven from and to airport in a mercedes limo. Help of 2 Peninsula's bellboy at the airport ( they stay there all day to accomodate incoming and outgoing client) to make sure we got our connecting flight to Shanghai. Took us all the way to the gate. Luxurious berroom and bathroom with daily changes of towels and faucet for purified water. TV while taking a bath or on a huge plasma screen in the bedroom. Great hallway with a little bar where you can enjoy 3-5 musicians playing either classical or soft music. 3 floors of the world most prestigious boutiques in the hotel,although you must expect to pay more than at home. Go shopping in the markets of Beijing where bargaining is a tradition and a must. Fitness of the first quality. In all a most enjoyable stay at a truly 5 stars hotel. And the price beats most other 5 stars in Beijing."
187,117,"May 2 2005	An oasis in Beijing	As others have noted, the Peniunsula Palace is an oasis within the noise, chaos, and dirt of Beijing. Renovated just a few years ago, rooms are decorated in an Asian-Western fusion style with silk bed accessories and hi-tech plasma TVs. Bathrooms are compact but practical with soaking tubs and granite and marble features--plus the amusing bathroom TV. Staff at the hotel are outstanding and consistently helpful and attentive. We especially enjoyed the beatiful fitness and spa facilities, including a wonderful indoor pool area and the thoughtul items tucked into each locker: robe, plush towel, flip-flops, and even a drawdstring plastic bag with which to transport wet bathing suits. The breakfast buffet, included with most room rates, is heavenly--a perfect mix of dim sum, Japanese, and the usual western standards. Of all the hotels I have stayed in in China, the Peninsula has by far the best breakfast. Service at breakfast can be slow, however; tea and coffee cups routinely run dry, and the pancake and waffle maker seems to take a lot of breaks. For other meals, the restaurant Jing is relatively unremarkable except for its great decor, which you can enjoy at breafast anyway. Our dinner there was solid, but hardly inspired, from a culinary perspective and frustrating from a service perspective (we couldn't find a member of the wait staff who spoke enough English to communicate my allergy to milk products, and I ended up with a dinner soaked in butter tnat had to be sent back). Huang Ting, the hotel's other major restaurant, is much better with an antique Chinese decor, highly attentive service, and great Chinese food. Overall, this is a great hotel. Other perks include the easy walking distance to Beijing's major shopping district, the nightly Snack Market (only for the brave!), and major sights in the city, including the Forbidden City."
188,117,"May 1 2005	Excellent hotel in Beijing	Although many new hotels continue to pop up in this bustling city of 15 million people, the Peninsula Palace is still a great place to stay. The location of this hotel is exceptional with a pedestrian mall only a block away. The hotel had well appointed rooms although ours wasn't huge. It offered two twin beds (actually doubles). The bathroom was beautiful and even had a TV allowing you to view while in the shower or bathtub. They also had a separate water faucet in the bathroom for drinking which made it nice to brush your teeth. I did so daily with no ill affects. They managed to maintain coolness in the rooms all night long, which is important to sleep soundly. Breakfast was included and was at Jing restaurant. Exceptional. The best array of international breakfast cuisine we found on our trip to China. They also have internet access that runs about 45 Yuan for 15 minutes or $8.50 US. The staff was very pleasant and most spoke English. They were helpful and like any you might find at a first rate hotel in NY. All in all a great place to stay."
189,117,"Apr 25 2005	Peninusla is a Palace!	Just returned from Beijing. 4/16/05-4/23/05. Stayed at the Peninsula Palace. What a fantastic hotel. From the minute we stepped out of our car till the moment we left we were treated wonderfully. It did take quite a bit of getting used to, as in the states we are not accustomed to such service and attentiveness. We are just normal folks who expect to do most things for ourselves...In fact, my 25 year old daughter commented on her trip back from the restroom by the lobby bar, that the attendent did everything short of going to the bathroom for her!!!! This hotel is number one is service and it is also beautiful. We had a standard adjoining room that was well appointed and decorated with a great view of the main street. The breakfast included in our room rate was delicious and the restaurant was beautiful looking as well. I have absolutly nothing negative to say about this hotel. The last time I went to a hotel that was as wonderful all around, was at the Ritz Maison Orleans in New Orleans, LA, USA. Peninsula Palace, You are tops, and you will see me again next trip!!!~Elle"
190,117,"Mar 20 2005 	Fantastic	This hotel was wonderful from start to finish.When we checked in, although we had a Chinese speaker with us they insisted on speaking English. The service from all of the staff throughout was prompt and impeccable. One of our party had a birthday while we were there and they sent a birthday cake to her room.The rooms were newly decorated and immaculate with everything you could want down to a TV in the bathroom. The buffet breakfast in Jing was the best I had in China and had a really good choice of western and Chinese food. This was included in our rate of 135USD a night (+ tax). This is a beautiful restaurant unfortunately we did not have the chance to eat there on an evening. We did order room service one night, which was not bad and reasonably priced for a five star hotel. The hotel had lots of other facilities that we did not have time to take advantage of, although we did have time to wander around all of the designer shops in the lobby. The only problem was that there was work ongoing during the day, which was quite noisy while trying to nap off jetlag, but this stopped by six o clock each night.Based on my experience there I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
191,117,"Mar 16 2005	Best Place in Town	Everything about the Peninsula Palace was spectacular. However, the service definitely stands out alone as the best reason to come to this hotel. The staff, at all levels, were terrific and incredibly helpful. The hotel underwent a recent renovation and the facilities are outstanding. Our standard king bed room was spacious for a city hotel, well appointed with nice modern furnishings and contained the large plasma TV that other reviewers raved about.We got a club level room that came with club amenities and it was well worth it. The club lounge served a delicious breakfast each day, had snacks and afternoon tea and then appetizers with evening cocktails. We took advantage of all the offerings of the club lounge during our stay.We also ate at both hotel restaurants and we found them to be quite reasonable (in US dollars standards) and very good. Huang Ting, the chinese restaurant in the hotel, was very good and highly recommended. One note of caution, we went out to the Quanjude Peking Duck restaurant one night which was raved about in several tour books as THE place to go for Peking Duck. We were rather disappointed at our expensive meal there and not at all impressed. Perhaps we just had bad luck...The location of the hotel is also excellent as it is within walking distance of the Forbidden City &amp; Tiananmen Square as well as some very good malls for shopping and eating.I would highly recommend the Peninsula for anyone traveling to Beijing!"
192,117,"Feb 25 2005	Service luxury and location - it has all three!	Nov 04 - this was my second trip to Beijing, taking American friends on side-trips out of Hong Kong. Its amazing what a great hotel experience will do to change your opinion of a city. On my last visit (Apr 04), we stayed at the New Otani which was a disappointment and detracted from our overall Beijing experience.We arranged hotel transfer from the airport which was seamless. Upon arrival at the Peninsula we were met in the motor lobby by hotel staff and immediately escorted to the club lounge, an experience which makes you feel special and your business valued. We were booked at the club level and received superb check-in from the club staff. There was a mistake in one of the room reservations needing twin beds (which I had re-confirmed by phone 2 days prior), which wasn't available, and so they upgraded my companions to a suite. Excellent recovery.The rooms were lovely and housekeeping staff was very, very good. Bathrooms in double room were a little tight (nothing beats Singapore Ritz-Carlton on bathrooms), but nonetheless very nice. Room light and TV controls are state of the art as well as the flat screen TV on the wall which leaves you plenty counter space on top of the bureau! The room has a great chaise lounge which is a nice alternative to always relaxing on the bed.Business center performed a quick task without as much as a hesitation.Concierge staff was amazingly patient and accommodating with very good recommendations. Dim sum at the hotel restaurant was delicious. Breakfast, tea and cocktail hour at the club level were well worth it.My husband and I are very discerning hotel guests and have stayed at many of the top hotels in Asia. This hotel exceeded our expectations."
193,117,"Jan 31 2005	By far the best	We stayed at the Peninsula Palace in mid-January at the end of our visit to China, and it proved to be the perfect ending to our trip. From the minute the driver and porter met us at baggage claim and whisked us away in the Mercedes, it was an excellent experience. We were met at the door and escorted to the club level, where we relaxed with drinks during check-in. Our room was beautiful and perfectly appointed - the console by the bed controlled everyting in the room (okay, so I was a bit afraid that coupled with the large plasma tv might render my husband unwilling to leave!). The lcd tv in the bath was just icing. Breakfast, tea, cocktails, and superb chocolates, along with help with reservations and transfers made this perfect hotel a bargain."

2,125,"Aug 22 2009 	Fantastic Service	I experienced a very pleasant 3 night stay at the Tian Rui Hotel recently. The staff were very knowledgable and spoke great English. It is worth pointing out that we ate supper at the hotel restaurant for 2 of our 3 nights in Beijing and not only was the food fantastic, but the restaurant staff were so friendly. They offered such amazing service.The hotel is located on a narrow alley (in a traditional Chinese Hutong), so it was very quiet. But within a 3 minute walk, you are at a very busy street corner with access to the subway (line 5). Hotel is also located very close to a pedestrian street catering to shoppers.A fantastic experience. I would definitely stay there again."
3,125,"Dec 5 2008 	Great Location and Friendly Staff	I stayed at this hotel at the end of an organized tour. We were booked for two nights with the tour and then I stayed an extra five days before switching to another hotel for a 3 week stay. I really appreciated this hotel a lot more after switching to my other hotel. This hotel is conveniently located right off Wangfujing Street and the night market. One of the biggest English bookstores in on Wangfujing street. There is a subway stop (Denhshikou Station) right down the road which is on line 5. The area is pretty safe, there are little shops all the way down the street where you can buy water, soda, food, etc. The hotel staff is very friendly and accommodating. It's not a Super8 anymore and all those signs were taken down. There is hotel restaurant that serves a breakfast buffet which is decent for China standards. They have Internet access for 5yuan for a 1/2 hour or 10 yuan for an hour. It's a lot easier to use their Internet then trying to find an Internet cafe. There are plenty of restaurants around. The rooms are spacious, they had 3 English speaking stations on the TV including HBO which can be nice after a long day of touristy stuff. The bathroom is very nice. The shower is roomy. Everything in the room was very clean and the housekeeping staff was very friendly. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
4,125,"Sep 23 2008 	Great Central Location	What a great inexpensive place for an American to stay! Everyone spoke English quite well, there was western-style and Chinese breakfast item available including eggs cooked to order and coffee. It's centrally located within walking distance to the famous night market, the main pedestrian street, the bank and a really good dumpling restaurant. The subway station is a quick block away at the end of the hutong which can whisk you away to the Forbidden City and other sites. Yet it's on a lovely quiet shaded hutong with little shops to buy fresh fruit and sodas. There is a hair salon/spa next door with lovely friendly folks who spoke no English but were accommodating with massage, facials, and hair styling. We walked in the opposite direction from the main street (Wangfujung Ave.) and in a few minutes were deep into another hutong which was cool with the shade of trees. The hutongs wind around and there are ordinary Beijing folks living their lives away from the hustle and bustle of the pedestrian street and the tourists. Anyway, great place to stay."
5,125,"Oct 30 2005	It is all about value!	I have traveled to Beijing many times in the past decade and stayed in over 12 different hotels. Tian Rui is one of the best. I stay in different hotels because of location or customer preference but when I am traveling on my dime, I stay at Tian Rui.Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Few hotels have ironing boards. This one does. I dislike carpeted rooms in China because they just collect dirt and they seldom clean the carpet. These rooms have hard wood floors.The location is perfect. Close to the city center. However, many taxi drivers would not take me there because they did not know exactly where it was. I got a name card for the garden hotel on the next block because it is right on Wangfujing. The taxi would drop me off at that hotel, then I just had to walk about a block to get to the Tian Rui.It is a great place to stay if it is your first time in Beijing. It is sufficiently Western-friendly to be comfortable but &quot;Chinesey&quot; enough to experience China. In the end, it is the best value I have found in Beijing."
6,125,"Jul 25 2005	Super 8 is Super Great!	Super 8 Tian Rui turned out to be an oustanding value and centrally located. Our courtyard hotel gave away one of our reserved nights to someone else, so they suggested Super 8 instead, just a block and a half away. I thought there was no way I was staying at a Super 8 in China, but after finding out that other hotels were booked, we decided to take a look. Located in the quiet Baishu Hutong, just off of Wangfujing Ave., the Super 8 felt like the bargain luxury hotel that it is not in the States. The doorman greeted us, the front desk staff spoke english, and the modern elevator swept us up to the 4th floor to our suite with two generous twin beds. We had a living room and a bedroom, a moderate sized bathroom that did not smell, a closet, fridge and mini bar, a TV in each room, window seats and many windows, a great air con with remote in each room, hardwood floors, super clean bed linens, clean suite all around, six chairs, two luggage stands, a closed with iron and board, a hairdryer in the bathroom and large shower. All this for Y600 (About $70). The lobby has a small bar and a restaurant that serves a breakfast buffet (Y40) and other meals. We had the buffet once. It was good with many chinese choices and a few american choices including eggs al gusto. You could eat cheaper close by, though, for much less. I would stay here again."
7,125,"Mar 21 2005	Great location price and service	This small hotel is managed by Days Inn. It's just down the street from Wangfujing Street, the main shopping street in Beijing. The rooms aren't huge, but the price is very reasonable (less than $50 per night, if you do a little bargaining) and the &quot;American-style&quot; service is much better than the usual lackadaisical attitude you'll get at other hotels in this price range. I stayed here in November 2003."
1,131,Jul 14 2009 	A Gem of an Experience - we'll stay here again	We stayed here during the Beijing Olympics and we were soooo happy with our choice. We were nervous at first staying in a more traditional hotel
1,132,"Aug 24 2008 	Gold Medal for the XiXI Youyi Hotel	This was a hotel secured by the travel company for the Beijing Olympics on a &quot;bronze&quot; package, i.e the third ranking hotel.To be fair it was all we expected and more! Located a mile WEst of Tianammen Square it is a 10 minute walk away from Xidan Subway station on Line 1. It is one of the city's main shopping districts and major department stores are on hand as well as a mall dedicated to Wedding Dress shops!The main reception to the hotel is on Level 8 of the building and the building is spacious. On Level 4 is a fine Korean Restaurant which is well worth visiting - an all you can eat buffet which is excellent.Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the service at the hotel is very friendly and attentive. Breakfast is served in the hotels' main rstaurant on the 8th and again it is a comprehensive buffet with Western and Oriental food available."
2,132,Oct 15 2007	Good location with comfortable room and wonderful breakfast	Better than expected...good location nearby shopping area and supermarket. Room is big with LCD screen though most channels are in Chinese. Comfortable bed with space to place all belongings. Variety of breakfast choice...chinese and american. There are many resturants on this building.Recommend all to stay...not far from many tourist spots by taxi and underground.
3,132,"Aug 25 2007	Much better than I expected...	I stayed in this hotel while on a school trip to China. It was much better than I expected! When our bus arrived to the hotel, the staff took all of our bags off the bus and up to the lobby and then to our room after we checked in. While waiting for check in, staff treated us to plates of fruit and pastries. Staff amazingly spoke English and understood what we needed. With a currency exchange office in the hotel, this was also a major convenience. There was also some restaurants in the hotel and shopping close by. The rooms were spacious and pretty comfortable. The only negative was the temperature was a little warm in the rooms. It was hard to cool down even when the thermostat was all the way down. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay here for being a mid class hotel."
4,132,"Jun 28 2007 	Hard to find? but worth the the effort!	I have just returned from a one week stay at the XIXI FRIENDSHIP HOTEL BEIJING. It was my first time in China, and I speak no Chinese, My B.A. flight arrived at 5.45 in the morning, and there was nothing open at the airport, and as I had no Chinese money I had to wait until 7.30 for the beaureaux de change to open. The easiest way to get to the hotel from the airport is to go through exit number 11 and there is a lady standing at what looks like a newspaper sellers booth, 'she doesn't speak any English' but just give her 16 Yuan (fixed fare) and she will give you a ticket, get on bus number 2 or 3 which are right in front of you, stay on the bus until everyone else gets off, it's about a 50 minute journey, the bus stops at the bottom end of the road in which the hotel is located, right near the Xidan metro station, walk up the road for about 3 or 4 minutes and the hotel is on the left, it doesn't look anything like a 4 star hotel from the outside, I had to ask a chap standing in the doorway if I was in the right place, but once you are there you will not be dissapointed. As another reviewer has mentioned the beds are very hard, but that would be my only complaint. a truly outstanding hotel, the reception is on the 8th floor (very strange) I was on a bed and breakfast board basis, and the breakfasts were very impressive (but avoid the baked beans as they are as hard as bullets)The hotel staff were very helpful throughout my stay, and I have no hesitation in reccomending this hotel. One of the best that I have ever stayed in."
5,132,"May 29 2007 	Overall - Not bad at all!	Great location where you can literally cross the street and find shopping, cafe shops, restaurants, taxi service, and a short walk (in my opinion) to the subway. The staff was friendly but don't expect too much English being spoken. Very few employees could understand me. Restaurants in hotel were also pretty good with free Western breakfast buffet. Beds are on the hard side (board-like), but very clean and enough room to feel comfortable. Stayed a week."
6,132,"Dec 27 2006 	Not bad...would go back again.	We stayed at the hotel in mid-November of 2006. The room was quite big but I was disappointed that we were given two twin beds rather than a queen/king bed since I prefer to sleep in the same bed as my husband. The bathroom was really nice but it was disappointing that despite the appearance the shower did not kick out enough pressure to have a good shower. Obviously labor is cheap in China as the one meal we had at the hotel we had 8-9 people serving us which made it somewhat uncomfortable to have so many eyes looking at us while we ate. We did walk around the hotel and the supermarket was close by which was convenient to get drinks and snacks. There wasn't a lot of information provided by the hotel so we weren't sure what services they offered beside the spa that was located in the hotel grounds (room service, business center, etc.) Also, there is a mall nearby but I didn't buy anything there since I thought Hong Kong had better deals. Regardless, the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly (but don't expect someone to speak English) and I would stay there again."
7,132,"Sep 17 2006	Convenience in a local shopping area	We paid 900 yuan for a huge king bed room and added 2 single beds for our kids and there was still plenty of space to manoevre around . Being on the 10th floor corner room, we had a panaoramic view of Beijing as half of the walls of the room were windows. It was also directly opposite the Xidan shopping center and literally next door to a supermarket so was excellent for location. However, the plumbing system seemed to be a problem as the shower would get flooded after a couple of minutes. But I must say the service was excellent and they did not hesitate to send someone up to fix the problem almost immediately, infact they sent 3 personnel up to get the problem sorted out even though I called them at midnight. Also the shopping in Xidan was very much catered for the local adults and I was looking more for kids clothing and things which they did not have."
1,133,Jul 30 2009 	Good bargain hotel	I stayed one night in the Villas section at the back of the hotel. The room was a bit dated but clean and spacious with fast internet. I paid only 298 RMB (about US $42). No CNN on the TV
2,133,May 25 2009 	There's nothing really wrong with this hotel but it's probably better for Chinese natives than American or Europeans.	I've really got no complaints about this hotel
3,133,Oct 10 2008	Seen better days avoid.	Try and avoid this hotel if you can
4,133,Oct 6 2008 	Beautiful hotel	This hotel is beautiful
5,133,Sep 23 2008 	Adeqate 4 star hotel	Large hotel with decent rooms although quite dark and there were no bedside lights.There is an office where you can make reservations for one of the five restaurants and we went with our Chinese Guide to book ameal in the Grill (enough rice for now). We checked with the office later in the day to ensure the restaurant was open and that there were still tables and we were told it was OK.Had a shower and went to the grill to find a notice saying it was closed from late August until early October.I rang Reception to enquire about another of the restaurants and after speaking to three members of staff I was no wiser.Few staff seems to understand English.Revolving restaurant do do nice international (ish) buffet meals.	
6,133,Jun 10 2008	Excellent Beijing hotel	We had two short stays at this hotel. On both occasions the room was excellent with good facilities.The buffet breakfast has something for everyone but is not cheap at about 9GBP.The bar and restaurant staff were obliging as were the concierge staff.I would recommend this hotel without any hesitation.	
7,133,Feb 29 2008 	Old tired socialist hotel	this hotel has a deal with Chinese government offices. The hotel staff really did not care about their clients because they got deals from the coferences sponsored by the government anyway. They still hold that bad attitute in the 60's and 70's when sales assistants acted like your bosses. They lose guests' laundry quite often
8,133,Oct 28 2007	good all round hotel	we recently stayed at the xiyuan hotel for 3 nights as part of an organised tour of china.we found this particular hotel perfectly adequate 
9,133,Oct 24 2007 	Good Solid Hotel	10/24/07 Just returned from staying at the Xiyuan Hotel. We were booked in one of the basic rooms
10,133,Oct 3 2007 	Great Hotel	Just finished a 30 day stay at the hotel for a work assignment so I have a good idea of the place. Service from staff was excellent and so quick whenever a request made. Language did not seem a barrier as staff patient and try to understand or would get assistance from staff that spoke English. Buffet breakfast was delicious with a large number of choices and eggs cooked to order. Big Carrefour store across street
11,133,Jul 17 2007 	Won't come here again!	We stayed in the smaller Xiyuan Villas
12,133,Sep 20 2006 	A Truly Dreadful Experience	I had the good fortune to attend a business trip to China and must say I had a wonderful time staying in some really nice hotels in Xiamen
13,133,Jul 14 2006 	Completely comfortable	Everything about this hotel was great. Comfortable rooms. great breakfast
14,133,May 30 2006	Excellent	Excellent Hotel. Nice Rooms
15,133,Jan 7 2006 	Good Food and location	Stayed at the hotel as part of an international conference in November. The range of food was good at reasonable prices
16,133,Sep 29 2005	A nice hotel	Stayed at the Xiyuan Hotel in August 2005 as part of a tour we were doing of China - found the hotel clean
17,133,Mar 20 2005 	The Xiyuan's a Real Find!	We have stayed twice at the Xiyuan Hotel in Beijing. It's about a 20 minute cab ride to the center of town
1,136,"Nov 25 2009 	Fine hotel for a reasonable price	Decent rooms - friendly staff. Free internet is nice. Very close to Main Train Station and Subway.Many shops, supermarkets and McDonald closeby.Walk to the subway in 5 minutes and explore the city.For those who can not find it:When you stand with your back to the trainstation - go right !There you will pass a busstation. Go into the first street to your right.There is a huge hotel on the corner. At the end of the street you will see a policestation.Go right and after 50 metres you will find the hotel on your left hand."
2,136,"Oct 20 2009 	Great value hotel	Would definitely recommend this to anyone travelling on a budget (as we were) who doesn't want to compromise on quality. At first we thought we might never find it as the cab driver stopped at various points to ask for directions, though I guess this is all part of the experience. When we did eventually find it, navigating through the Hutong was abit of a shock to the system considering it was our first time in Asia, but we soon came to realize that this was part of the Zhong-An's charm. The location suited us fine as it was walking distance from the main Beijing Railway Station.The hotel and it's staff catered for all our needs. We speak no Chinese yet we were able to communicate with relative ease. The rooms were well kept and serviced daily. The en-suite facilities were also great - the one time we did have a problem with our toilet it was fixed that morning. The additional facilities that the hotel offers were also a real bonus - free internet access and free bike hire, which is a great way to get around Beijing if you can brave the roads. There is also a well-stocked shop and equally well-maintained courtyard on site if you're looking for somewhere to chill out at the end of a night or plan the day ahead. They also offer an excellent tourist service desk, which we used to book an excursion to the Great Wall (highly recommeneded) and got lots of useful help from on stuff like using the subway system, evening entertainment, getting to the Olympic Park, etc. Makes all the difference in terms of getting the most out of your stay in Beijing.We only booked for the first 2 nights as a precaution, but we were so content we decided to stay there the whole 8 days we were in Beijing."
3,136,"Oct 15 2009 	Great Hotel for the $ and in an easy location for Beijing travel	I stayed here for three nights in September and rebooked for two nights in October before I flew home. I thought the rooms were more than adequate, cleaned daily and the staff did a super job of handling my sub standard Mandarin. This was my first trip to China and when I return I will definitely consider the Zhong An. Within a couple of blocks of the train, subway and markets, not to mention easy walking to Tian Anmen Square, the Forbidden City and countless other attractions in the area."
4,136,"Oct 9 2009 	Great Location clean place good hotel	This hotel was nice (the second nicest I stayed in in all of China -- 6 different hotels). It was clean, but a bit small. We had a queen sized bed that nearly filled the entire room, leaving little space for bigger luggage, but it was ok. The hotel has 4 flights, but no elevator, and we were on the 4th floor, so checking in an out wasn't the funnest, but it wasn't all that bad.It was a great location, just a couple minutes from the train station, bus stops and subway station, making getting around Beijing as simple and inexpensive as can be. We got off the airplane, got on the subway line that leaves from the airport toward the city, transfered trains at the DongZhiMen Station and hopped on line #2 a few more stops and got off at the Beijing Station stop. From there it was a 5 min walk to the hotel. I've never been to China in my life, but still found it easy to get around and find this place on my own (after reading reviews here on Trip Advisor, of course). So getting from the airport to the hotel is super quick, easy and CHEAP!There are tons of places to get food just across the street, including a shopping mall with some yummy Chinese fast food places (beef noodle soup, noodles, etc).Even though it was right by the train station (when we looked out the window we looked straight out onto the tracks) it wasn't ever so noisy that it woke us up. The staff was helpful and called taxis for us, told us about local attractions. I speak Mandarin, so I was able to chit chat with them, but all of them also had proficient English. Our room (and all rooms, I assume) had free internet and a flat screen TV. We were able to leave our luggage at the hotel for free when we checked out in the morning, and then pick it up in the evening just before catching our train to XiAn. Only negatives were: the lack of an elevator (no biggie), small room size (no biggie) and the fact that they seemed stingy about giving us Toilet Paper every day (which was odd and annoying, but again, no biggie). Really a great place and I would stay there again. Good price for a nice little place in such a great location."
5,136,"Sep 7 2009 	Checked out after 3 hours...	We checked into the Zhong An Hotel on Sunday, August 9th. We checked out 3 hours later. We spent those entire 3 hours searching for a way to cancel our booking and find another hotel. When we entered our room a the Zhong An, we realized we had been duped into reserving a rat hole. It was disgusting! The room had just been cleaned, but there were hairs all over the tile floor in little wet clumps (as if they had come from a mop that wasnt cleaned or replaced in years). Looking out the window, we realized we were literally no more than 30 feet from the train tracks of the Beijing Rail Station  Beijings main (and thus busiest) station. Every time a train pulled in or out of the station, we could hear it, feel it, and see it. Walking into the bathroom we were shocked to see more mold in the shower than weve ever seen in one place before. It was repulsive. Who wants to take a shower where rubber boots and gloves are needed? The toilet space was hardly a space at all. Were not large men, but we practically had to sit sideways on the toilet because there was so little room (mere inches) between the seat and the wall in front). And finally, there were packages of condoms sitting at the ready on the counter above the sink. It appeared to be that kind of establishment. This hotel was incredibly below standard, and entirely misrepresented - especially by the pictures."
6,136,"Aug 20 2009 	Good value for money	This hotel is in No.6 Kuijiachang Hutong, very close to the Railway Station.It's has been very diffucult to reach, cause no one of the taxi drivers knew the address.It's a very little street behind the Central Railway Station.The hotel is very close to the Beijing Youth Hostel and the price are pretty the same, but my personal advice is to prefer this one. The rooms are nice and clean, the service is polite and helpful.Internet is free, if you have your PC. At the opposite it's possible to rent a PC for 10 RMB per night. There is also a public PC in the living room, but it is just for rapid consultations.We didn't like the breakfast: the international one should be improved (we've not tried the chinese one). Please note that booking via Expedia the breakfast is not included.The location is very useful: close to the Central Railway Station (5 minutes by walk), to the Subway station (5 minutes by walk) and to the Airport Shuttle Station (10 minutes by walk).BEST: Value for money/LocationWORST: Not simple to reach via taxi."
7,136,"Aug 6 2009 	Very good value good location.	This Chinese hotel (meaning not a typical Western-style tourist hotel) is a very good value, located in a hutong about 3-5 minutes walk to the main Beijing train station and the subway (#2 line). The staff speaks enough English to get by and is very friendly. The breakfast is Chinese style, not Western. This is a good way to experience real Beijing on the cheap. The rooms are adequate and the nearby train station is not as noisy as I thought it would be. They have one computer with internet access available for free use, and will provide a computer for your room very inexpensively if you request one (10rmb per day when I was there)."
8,136,"Jun 24 2009 	Small Hotel but Great Value for Money	Of course you cannot compare this hotel to a 4 or 5 star hotel; you pay for what you get. For the price I paid for a 2-bedroom suite at this hotel, I am more than happy with what I get. In my opinion, it was great value for money. Rooms were clean and service was good. However, I am not exactly sure if the hotel staff speaks English as I spoke with them in Mandarin.Some have complained about noise from the trains. However, during my 6 night stay there in a room facing the railway tracks, my family barely heard the trains.The hotel is located to the west of the Beijing Railway Station. (Note there are several Railway stations in Beijing) If you are facing the railway station, go towards your left until you hit the traffic lights. At the traffic lights, turn right until you see the police station. The hotel is to the right of the police station. Beijing is a big city so it is best that you carry a map showing the location of the hotel to the taxi driver. You can also reach Beijing Railway Station by the Airport Shuttle Bus. There is a subway station right outside the Beijing Railway Station.Downside of hotel, if any, are that there are no lifts and breakfast is very basic. For westerners, the only familiar food is probably toast and diluted orange juice and coffee. But then, for 10 yuan, what can one really expect? Hotel is also located in a hutong so expect the alleys leading to the hotel to be a little dirty. But if you have not seen a Beijing hutong, you have not really seen Beijing, have you? Have an enjoyable stay in Beijing and expect to do a lot of walking if you want to properly see the sights. The Summer Palace is not to be missed."
9,136,"May 27 2009	Bejing ZhongAn Inn: A Suprisingly Good and Inexpensive Hotel	As many other reviewers have mentioned, this little gem is situated in the center of the city and is very convenient for both Beijing sightseeing and traveling between city since the train station is 7 minutes away. The two bedroom suite we stayed in is roomy and, for the most part, well maintained. We stayed at the hotel for three days and the only problem we had was with a leaking shower, which they fixed, for the most part, (it still had a small leakage of water when we took long showers) as soon as they were told about it. It doesn't have all the amenities of a four hotel but for its costs, it was less than $75 for the suite, it is a bargain by any standard. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful with any requests and the breakfast for less than $1 each, while not the most delicious I have tasted, is at least filling and doesn't taste bad. I also enjoyed the free internet access, which has cost me $10 a night at other places we have stayed in Beijing. I would highly recommend the Zhong An Inn to anyone that doesn't need the opulence and luxury of a four star hotel."
10,136,"Feb 26 2009 	Long-term Visit--Good Experience	I stayed at this hotel for a month while on an extended trip in Beijing. The experience was generally very nice, though it had its ups and downs. On the good side, the rooms were reasonably clean and bright, the staff was very sweet and helpful (with the exception of the girl who booked the tours who lived in her headphones and was perpetually and inexcusably rude), it was fairly inexpensive ($30/night), and the location was generally quite convenient (though there are NO restaurants in the area aside from a couple of fast food places). It was winter, so I took the subway each day (five-minute walk), but in nicer weather, it would be an easy walk to the Silk Market or Guo Mao or to Wangfujing or Tiananmen Square in the other direction. On the not-so-good side, the alley in which the hotel is located was rather disgusting and always wet, though it did not rain and snow once while I was there (which makes you wonder), the restaurant was terrible, and the hotel is, indeed, right on the train tracks. If you are at all a light sleeper, I highly suggest you ask for a room facing the courtyard. I began in a room facing the tracks and couldn't hack it. In addition, while the rooms are, as I said, reasonably clean, I agree with other reviewers who have noted the lack of effort in cleaning the bathrooms. The same hair that was in the corners of the floor when I checked in was there when I left a month later, and it wasn't mine. The shower also leaked like a sieve. I suggest putting a towel on the floor to catch the water.Also worth mentioning, perhaps, is that I started out in a suite because I knew I would be there for some time and wanted the space but switched to a double room after a couple of days. The double room was much smaller, but I preferred it. It was much brighter, the walls were painted in cheery pastels, and while I had originally had thoughts of staying in the suite in order to cook a few meals myself, the &quot;kitchenette&quot; was nothing more than a sink and a vent--no cooking apparatus, no pots, dishes, etc., so there is really no reason to stay in the suite, especially as one person.If you plan to stay for several days, you should ask them about their membership card. It costs Y200, but you save Y40 per night or each night you stay, and breakfast is included in your room rate with the card.On a final note, I noticed while walking around that this hotel has a second branch in Beijing behind Wangfujing (near the Dongdan subway stop). That location is much better, though I do not know if the rates are the same. You might check out that location as well before deciding which to stay in."
11,136,"Feb 23 2009 	Good location cheap and clean	This is a small hotel very well located withing 5 minutes walking distance from Beijing's main railway station and its subway station.The location is quite good but the hotel is located in a hutong and thus is hard to locate even by taxi drivers.Despite being in a hutong the area seemed safe and I had no problems. Having a nearby police station probably helps.I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in late December 2008.My room was on the 4th floor. There was no elevator and I had to carry my own bags so take this into consideration when booking a room.The rooms were clean and small though not tiny with more than enough room to place bags and to do some work on my laptop using the Ethernet Internet connection (cable supplied). The floors were wood (parquet) and clean. The bed was good for one though probably too narrow for two with a firm mattress and very clean sheets.The bathroom was tiny but everything was very efficiently arranged so that its size was not a problem. It had a western style toilet and a shower (no bathtub) as well as the usual amenities (comb, soap, shampoo, tooth-paste and brush as well as the usual discardable flip-flops in China). Everything was clean.The room had an LCD TV with only one channel in English (CCTV 6) but the picture quality was not very good.My room was non-smoking and there were no smoke smells in it.From my understanding there are 2 kinds of rooms: some face the courtyard while others face the railway. Mine faced the courtyard and I had no trouble with outside noise but I can't comment on the rooms facing the railway though the rooms did seem to be well insulated both acoustically and thermally.There was an electrical kettle in the room to boil some tee or to prepare some noodles (very common in China).Having stayed there in the Winter I can say that the water based heating was quite good though my travel companion did complain about it being noisy (I didn't hear any noise coming from it).There is a shop open until quite late that sells all sorts of items from water and snacks to lip-balm at reasonable prices that proved quite convenient and a restaurant that I didn't try.At the lobby there is a tour agency where I booked 2 one day tours. One to the Ming tombs and the Great Wall (Badaling) and another to the Summer palace, Forbidden City and Temple of Heaven.The tours were of average price with the first one with 2 &quot;commercial stops&quot; at a jade factory and a tea house and the second one at a cloisonet. We did get a fair amount of time to visit the places and the guide did speak understandable English. Tours are usually on a bus but on the second day the tour was on a car since only 2 people had booked it. My advice is if you can do things on your own do it but in case of some problem (in my case very cold weather) these are an acceptable second choice.The staff was friendly, efficient and spoke understandable English and understood my English with no major difficulties.Overall this hotel is quite good for a no frills stay and considering the rates it's very good value for money.Getting to the hotel can be problematic. Try printing the address in mandarin to show the taxi-driver or some other local.To get there, go to Beijing railway station, face the entrance (you should be facing South), turn 90 degrees to your left and move forward (East, Beijingzhan Dongjie). After the bus stop take the first right turn just before a large hotel (you will be facing South). At the end of this road you should see a police station (this is also a nice reference point to ask the locals for). Go there and take another right turn (West). The hotel should be located at your left side after walking a short distance. Just look for the green and yellow building.The address is ????????????????6? and the phone number [--].If you follow these instructions you should get to the hotel with no trouble.If you go to the hotel by taxi remember to demand that the taxi stops at the door (green and yellow building) because although the road is narrow there is plenty of room for the taxi driver to get to the door. I was dropped far from the hotel assuming it was just around the corner and with very cold weather adding to the disorientation that was not nice experience.You should also have a look at the hotel's website www.zhong-an.com.cn and at my pictures where I include a snapshot of the hotel's card."
12,136,"Jan 7 2009 	Great little hotel	This was a great little hotel, it far exceeded our expectations. We knew that our room would be small, but the use of space was very well done, we didn't feel cramped at all. Our room had one king size bed, a small closet, a desk, and a small table that had a tea kettle on it. There was also one of those folding camp chairs in the room ( a bit odd, but I guess just one way to save space). The bed was hard, but I've heard that they are like that just about everywhere in China. They had one hard pillow and one soft pillow. The bathroom had a western style toilet and a small shower (the shower did leak water but we just used the towels to sop it up and they replaced them every day, it really wasn't a hassle). They kept the room and the entire hotel exceptionally clean. The toilets in the downstairs lobby area were the squatter kind, so I would believe that some rooms do have those kind too. We weren't asked what kind of toilet we would prefer, I assume that since we are American they just gave a room with a western toilet. The front desk staff was very helpful with any questions that we had for them. There was always at least one person working whose english was great. They were always willing to help us with anything be it calling a taxi or suggesting a restaurant or even helping us mail things.  The breakfast buffet at the hotel restaurant was great, we tried to eat there every morning when we could. It cost 10 yuan a person and there was plenty to eat. The coffee was scary to look at but it tasted like those instant flavored coffees that were popular a while back, and sometimes the milk was hot, but overall it was very good and filling. They had vegetables, rice, eggs, breads, rolls, toast, cake, and more that I can't remember, but I would definitely recommend eating there. We only had dinner there once and it was good not great, but for the price it couldn't be beat. We found the proximity to the subway to be just perfect, it was only a 3-5 minute walk. The bus stop was even closer than that. I would recommend stopping in the airport at the hotel information areas and having them write the hotel name in Chinese characters, our cab driver still had to call someone to get directions exactly but at least he could read where we wanted to go.  Overall, we had a great experience with this hotel and would stay here again and we would absolutely recommend this hotel to other travellers."
13,136,"Dec 26 2008	Reasonable hotel	Beijing Zhongan Hotel October 2008 I stayed in this hotel a couple of months ago, it is within a 10min walk of the Beijing Railway station, which makes it ideal for most travellers. The room I stayed in although overlooking the railway track was clean and tidy. It was part of a suite for a family.  The bathroom though could have looked better, it did look rather grim and not looked after very well., the staff spoke english, and were fine. The hotel also served a western breakfast which was ok."
14,136,"Oct 12 2008 	good hotel for the price	I booked this hotel via www.elong.net (as they seemed to have the lowest price 220 yuan for a single) for my short trip to Beijing. It was easy to find per the directions in the other reviews. If you are coming by subway (which is very easy to do now via the airport express subway) leave from the Beijing Railway Station Exit C. As you leave that exit, just keep walking straight. The train station square will be on your right. You'll go under a pedestrian overpass and then pass some shops and restaurants on your right. You do not have to cross the main street there. You'll get to the bus station on your right and at the far northeast corner of the bus station (just before the back of a large hotel in front of you) make a right down the alley. You'll see the police station at the end of the alley. When you reach the police station, turn right and the hotel will be just steps away on your left.Front desk staff were polite with great English skills. No difficulty on check-in. They had my reservation. You do have to leave a 200 Yuan deposit for the room keycard. They do accept credit cards. I had a single room which was typical Asian size with a typical Asian hard bed. It was clean. They had both soft fluff pillows and the hard bean-filled pillows. There was a computer in the room for which I disconnected the internet connection and had no trouble using my laptop on their network. (I changed rooms later and in my second room there was no computer although they did have an internet connection and cable so I could still use my laptop). The bathroom was small but clean and useable. There is no tub and the shower leaked all over the floor (regardless of how I directed the shower head or what I did to the shower door). There was the obligatory comb, toothbrush, soap, and shanpoo. There is an electric kettle with green and black tea in the room, restocked daily. Towels changed daily. I stayed twice at this hotel and the first stay my room faced the courtyard and the second stay faced the railroad tracks. The railroad track noise is only midly bothersome. They have double windows to try and help with some of the noise but I could sleep through it even with the windows open. The breakfast is now 10 Yuan and is as described previously with mostly Chinese food (cooked and raw vegetables, edible but not exactly tasty sausage, fried rice, etc.). They also had hard boiled eggs and the chef an fry eggs for you. There was usually some fruit (watermelon, bananas, tomatoes) and a variety of buns (steamed and baked, sweet and savory). There was weak tea, some &quot;coffee-like&quot; product, milk, and weak orange flavored drink available as well as sliced white bread and a toaster. I did not try the lunch or dinner.Getting a taxi or getting help with local calls was no problem as the desk staff were always willing to help. The location of the hotel was good but could be better. Although there are some restaurants nearby, most either cater to the train travelers and are a bit sketchy or are ultra expensive in the fancy hotels nearby. There is much better fare available downtown. The proximity to the train station and metro stops is a plus. On the weekday mornings during rush hour I suggest walking the little bit extra to get on the subway at Jianguomen. The line to board the subway at the railway station line can be very long and they keep the nearby entrance closed so you must enter through the northwestern corner of the railway station square which is about as far as Jianguomen. Also know that Beijing Railway Station is not the main train station as many trains leaving Beijing will go from Beijing Xi (west) station. All in all a great value and good hotel."
15,136,Oct 9 2008 	Comfortable	We are traveling with two children and woried about geting a family room. Stayed 4 days ( 06 to 10 Oct 2008) in room no. 1101 as suggested by other traveler. The room had two bed rooms and charged 468 CNY.The hotel is clean confortable. Front desk speak english and helpfull. On request restaurent served us vegitarian food in dinner. Location was slightly interior but very close to bus station and railway station. Unlike the earlier previews we found buses not so crowded. Took 10 no. bus to Tianam min Sq. and 122 to Temple of Heaven. Subway was closer and could travel arround the city with children with out any difficulty.
16,136,"Sep 8 2008 	Good Bargain	I'm actually writing this on the computer in the hotel room. I am giving this an above average rating because for the $28 per night I got this for on Travelocity, you could not expect better. However, I am not completely thrilled with my choice and am going to move to a slightly more expensive hotel after my reservations expire. I should note that I am staying in the least expensive single room. The Good: Friendly staff, good maid service, computer with internet in room, more than 60 channels on flat screen TV (all Mandarin but hopefully you didn't come here to watch TV), wooden floor so no nasty carpet, good air conditioning, clean bed and sheets, relatively new toilet, and convenient location (near Beijing Train Station subway stop)The Bad: Bathroom is moldy, size of room (and doubles don't look much bigger), bed is hard as a rock (common in China), and it's a bit noisy.Expansion on the above: I sleep with earplugs on the rock hard bed and I have slept very well. The location is a blessing and a curse. Yes, it's near the train station and subway and it's down a hutong. But the Hutong is really nasty; you cannot get to the hotel without walking past a foul smelling public bathroom. The kids in the hutong are super cute, but this isn't the quaint hutong that some of the nicer traditional hotels are in. However, despite what your first impression might be, it's quite safe.So, in short, I'd say this is a great hotel for backpackers and budget-seekers. If I were here just to see the sites in Beijing for a few days, I'd think this was just fine. But for a longer stay, for someone who needs to do some business, this probably isn't appropriate.Finally, I should mention that I had avoided the hotel restaurant until today (thinking it might be a bit touristy). Today, I decided to give it a try. I've lived in both Taiwan and mainland China and thought the food was EXCELLENT. Definitely give it a try!"
17,136,"Aug 30 2008 	Family friendly run hotel	We are a family of 5 whio have just returned from the Olympic Games in Beijing and stayed 8 nights in this great little hotel. After leaving Thailand in a 5/6 star hotel; we were rather worried as to what we would find in Beijing but were very happy with this great little place. As we have 3 kids we have to book 2 rooms in hotels but with the olympics in town this was unaffordable, this hotel however offered us a 2 room appartment which turned out to be ideal. We had heard all the stories of smog and no english spoken and surly taxi drivers but we saw blue skies for most of the trip, road signs and subways in English and taxi drivers as helpful as they could be. The staff were also great at the hotel and keen to pracise their English, best thing was the restaurant serving fabulous chinese food at a fraction of we pay back home. The breakfast was pretty basic with watermelon and toast being the main ingredients unless you can face noodles and what goes with them, no cereals,yoghurts etc and coffee served in a glass.....hey this is China. Being the olympics the hotel had a real cross section of visitors alll dressed in their national colours and we were so pleased we had not chosen some souless large hotel we loved all the characters on display and the camaraderie amongst us all, everyone swopping tips and stories with each other about how to get around what to see etc.The hotel is in a great location amonst the original hutong buildings which are rapidly disappearing as Being is sanitized. You got the option to walk through the hutong area whch we did most days and see how the chinese really live.....very basically!! but we were greeted with smiles and hellos from the children and as long as you made the first move to snile at the people they were very responsive and many times were rewarded with a &quot;Welcome to China&quot;.The only bad thing to say about the hotel was the hardness of the beds and the sand filled pillows.....but after an exhausting day you could sleep on anything.This is a great place to stay in Beijing very central for everything with great staff all eager to please.........thanks we had a great time."
18,136,"Jul 25 2008 	Zhong An a Great wee hotel	This little hotel was perfect for my travels within Beijing. I was bit concerned about tracking it down upon arriving at Beijing train station, however do not have any worries.I shall explain how to get there; from busy entrance to train station, proceed walking short distance in Easterly direction along Beijingzhan East street (Beijingzhan Dongjie), past bus stop to shortly reach Dayangmao Hutong road (red road sign).  Just turn Southerly down this side street and stroll down to police station at end. Turning right, Zhongan appears in your face. Can't miss the distinct green/yellow exterior !  Follow these simple instructions from main train station entrance.I have also determined their website, www.zainn.com, then select Beijing Zhongan option from list, of their accommodations. There is wee map to be found here, however I feel my instructions may be clearer.The hotel is near Metro subway Beijingzhan railway station and really is not far from main Wanfujing shopping street, Tiananmen square and Forbidden city to name but a few major attractions. Chongwenmen Metro station is also nearby. I believe the new line running from Capital (PEK) airport, will be operative prior to staging of Olympics.Meanwhile, hotel was Best Value on my Peoples Republic of China adventures. Their Chinese breakfast was extremely cheap and in general, I encountered no reasons to complain whatsoever.My room reminded me of 'student like' living quarters and sounds from the trains at the station, just outside didn't manage to annoy me too much.I would definately return to this wee hotel. It really is &quot; Zhong an (central) and super value &quot;"
19,136,"Jul 16 2008 	What a great gem	I stayed at this hotel last week. I had read loads of comments regarding the hotel but still went with open mind. Hotel was absolutely great. Its cheap, yet you have everything you need and more. The hotel is very central in Beijing. The restaurant and shop at the premises offer a great service and value for money. I had a single room that was clean, included free access to internet and television with 13 channels. Room was cleaned every day and the hotel was very tidy overall. My room was facing the inner court in hotel, so the noise from the railway station next to it couldnt be heard. Staff was helpful and although English wasnt spoken a great deal, they were still willing to go out of their way to help the guests. I had no problems communicating with anyone at this hotel. The buffet breakfast had everything you wanted, to Eastern or Western taste and the price was ridiculously cheap. The meals at lunch and dinner were equally cheap and very large size. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to explore Beijing at lower budget but with great service. You can also book trips to Great Wall and sightseeing tours around Beijing at affordable prices and they hire bicycles for guest for free, with a small deposit. Beijing is a great city with loads to offer to tourists. I would recommend hiring a bicycle for day for adventurous tourist. This was a great way to explore the citys disappearing Hutong areas. I also went on a trip to Great Wall with a tour operator organised by hotel. I found that was great value for the money, as it includes other trips on the way to Great Wall. As a single woman traveller, I found Beijing one of the safest metropolitan cities that Ive visited and travelling is easy with most of the street names/place names/directions and public transport in English. As the hotel is by Beijings biggest railway station, seeing the city by underground or bus is not a problem. Do make sure you have directions to this hotel written in Chinese as taxi drivers in Beijing don't speak English and hotel might be difficult to find.I will definitely stay in this hotel when visiting Beijing next time."
20,136,"May 11 2008 	Qute difficult to find but not so bas	We spent few days in Beijing in may. Thanks to a tripadvisor review printout, we reached the hotel.Hotel is clean but most of people working there don't speak English so it's quite difficult to ask for something.We booked by internet and when we arrived they gave us a room without window at ground level. We managed to change (without price increase) but we got a room without computer and a window on railways."
21,136,"Apr 1 2008 	Recommendation for Zhong An Hotel - Great Value Hotel	1. Travelocity had the best price for this hotel. It was more expensive on Orbitz &amp; similar sites.2. Great for the value - the rooms are compact but not tiny. Space is well organized. They are clean, the bed is slightly hard but comfortable. The rooms are equipped with computers that have internet access - a huge plus.3. Hotel staff is helpful and friendly &amp; every willing to help. 4. Location - A little hard to find but you can get here for RMB 16 (16Yuans) from the airport by bus. I would recommend printing the address in Chinese. The bus from the Beijing airport drops you off at the Beijing Train Station and the hotel is a short walk from there. Really easy to get around Beijing from here using either the local bus (tickets are 1 yuan) or by the Beijing subway (tickets are 2 Yuans.) Taxis are also very cheap.5. Things to look out for -- tours made at the hotel are subjective. I did not have a good experience booking a tour through the travel desk at the hotel. They use a company called Beijing Youth Travel Service. Our guide hardly spoke any English and it was a mixed group of Chinese &amp; English tourists - she primarily interacted with the CHinese tourist which is fine expect I thought I was on an English tour.6. I would highly recomment The QinChunJiaRi International Travel Service. I found them while walking around Tiananmen Sq. Our guide Leena was great, witty, articulate - in short she knew her stuff. If you have time I would recommend booking tours last minute through this company while you are strolling around Tiananmen Sq. on your first day in Beijing."
22,136,"Mar 6 2008 	Not bad for the price	We were lucky in that we had a competant taxi driver who phoned the hotel for directions when he was near the railway station. Bit of a worry when you start to go down small laneways. Reception - appears only 1 person was fluent in English and he was effecient, problem when he is not on. There was a change with the bookings so the other family we were travelling with and us shared an apartment type room, 2 bedrooms, sitting area and bathroom. Rooms were clean, no faults at all and the bathroom has a bath. It overlooked the railway line but the trains could not be heard and was good value for the price.Food cheap breakfast but limited unless you like pickled vegetables, coffee and tea was very weak. Dinner, was cheap but Beijing style of cooking is oily and even the Chinese members in our group did not like it. English is not spoken in the restaurant nor does anyone look happy. But food is also available across the main road, say 5 minutes away.Tour desk service was ok.I liked the surrounding hutongs and felt safe walking down them at night. It is well located to 2 underground lines and the main railway station."
23,136,"Feb 19 2008 	once you find it...it's ok	mom booked with airfare, hotel must pay alot for website.Very hard to find as no cab drivers speak English. The drivers have a difficult time with traffic around the train station.  Smoking still allowed in lobby and restaurant areas, so if that is an issue, be prepared. The public toilet in the room area lobby can be really smelly, but the rooms are clean. This is a NO Frill place to crash, and for only 5 nights it was ok.  Once you find it, the secret to getting to back is using Beijingzhan &quot;jon&quot; as the cabbies all know where the train station is."
24,136,"Dec 8 2007 	Not that great	I don't really get how this hotel has gotten so good reviews.Location: Not that good to be honest. It's better to live closer a subway. Rooms: Sure, clean, but nothing mote. Nothing but chinese channls. Staff: Can't speak englishBreakfast: horribleOverall: It's a hostel. I think it will suit you if you're a really cheap backpacker."
25,136,"Oct 25 2007 	mixed review	i stayed here for 2 weeks after booking it on expedia, based on its price and location. it's located by beijing railway station, which is near a subway stop and very convenient to get to the major atractions in beijing. it's located in a hutong, which may look undesirable or depressed to some people but i liked it- it gives you a more realistic picture of how many working people in beijing live. the staff were pleasant most of the time and enough knew english to be able to communicate with me. the single room was very small, no heat, and it had no minibar or frig available. it did have a free computer to use in the room, convenient to get a source of news and weather. the tv had one english language station with official state news on it. breakfast buffet was 67 cents, a great bargain!!! the hotel was clean, housekeeping was good, but the sheets had not been changed when i first got to the room. the hotel was quiet to sleep in, if you ask for a room facing the inner courtyard and not the train tracks. price was reasonable."
26,136,"Aug 6 2007 	Convenient Location Cheap Clean and nicer than expected!	As noted, this hotel is a little tricky to find. I printed the home page in Chinese and handed it to the cab driver. I also dialed the hotel phone and when they answered handed it to the driver. I speak almost no Chinese. It's easiest to get taken to the Beijing Railway Station. There is a 16 RMB Shuttle bus (about $2.25 usd) from the airport. A cab will cost you about 90-100rmb (around 12 or 13 usd). Once you arrive at the Beijing train station, if you are facing the front of the station, walk LEFT on the same side of the street as the train station. Walk a couple of blocks and when you get to a parking lot full of buses where you will turn right. Walk to the end of the street where you will see a police station. Take a right here and the hotel is on the left hand side.There are many Westerners staying in this hotel. I think each room has a computer with free internet (mine did). The room was small and clean (i got a single for about 35usd). The staff speaks English and is helpful. There is a travel agent in the lobby that can book you on a full day tour of Beijing, The Great Wall, score you tickets to an acrobat show, etc. The location is a couple of blocks walk to the subway which is almost right outside the railway station. A ride on the subway costs 3 rmb (less than 50 cents). An easy ride to Tianamen Square, Forbidden City and many other attractions. There is a breakfast that costs 5 rmb (about 75 cents). It's totally Chinese, but you may like it. There's a restaurant and cafe where you can order beers and sit in the courtyard. Very nice for 2 stars as someone else stated. Has kind of a youth hostel feel to it, but it's completely fine. You can't beat the price either!"
27,136,"May 27 2007 	Not the best location	Stayed a few nights in May 2007, and found the location less desirable: many cabs, on showing the hotel business card, refused to take us there. If you have to walk to the hotel, many of the hutong alleys are quite smelly. Moreover as trains pass by the whole place starts trembling.Think there are better places to be found in Beijing."
28,136,"Apr 10 2007	Very nice for 2 stars!	We stayed for two nights in April 2007 in the Zhong'an hotel. As Scott said, it is difficult to find, and the street you have to go through to get there is not the most glamorous one. But it is very centric and the hotel itself is very nice, much better than I expected for 2 stars! Everything is very new. We got the room 1101 which is actually the two bedroom appartment. It had 2 big rooms, one with a double bed and another one with twin beds. Both rooms have a nice TV (although nearly all you can watch is in Chinese though), and it is not on the side of the trains so it is very quiet, had a great sleep! The bathroom is very nice and has everything you need, from shampoo to shower gel, plus toothbrush and toothpaste. The appartment also has a little table and chairs, nice for a coffee in the morning!The breakfast was not so great but it is only 5 yuan anyhow, which is around 50 euro cents."
29,136,"Mar 31 2007 	Great hotel once you can find it	First thing - know how to get to the hotel. If you catch the bus from Captial Airport, take Route 3 to the Beijing Train Station. When you alight, ignore the touts wanting to give you a lift on their rickshaw - I can tell you from experience that they will leave you stranded (but at least it will be near by).Head from the bus in the direction that the bus is facing and on the same side of the road that you got off the bus on. At no time do you have to cross the main road. As you follow the path, you will go past a couple of walk side shops and then finally through to the forecourt of the Beijing train station. This should take 2 minutes.Cross the forecourt staying close to the road. There will be people everywhere. You will be walking in an easterly direction. Once leaving the forecourt, keep walking past some shops and you will get to a bus interchange. Walk past this and you will see a road to the right. There is a sign post with blue signs in Chinese and then there is one of the bottom that is red indicating a Hutong starting with D (as I am currently staying in the hotel - I will get the name and update shortly). Take this road and follow it right to the end. As you walk along the road, on the left will be the back of the Marriot hotel (under construction at this time). At the end of the street is a police station - turn right at this point and the hotel is on the left just up the street. Green and yellow in colour.The hotel reception staff are friendly and efficent. They charge a 200 Yuan deposit for the room key. The key is a card like you get in major hotels that you swipe over the door panel to get in. The rooms are plain but have heating and aircondioning. The bathroom has a western toilet and towels are provided. There is no fridge.In the room I had there was a computer and free access to the internet, along with a TV. Only one station in English (a news station). The computer also let me download my digital photos and upload to a flash disk.The bed is hard, but you can't have everything. I was in a single room - not sure how much bigger the doubles are.Check on the view - I got a room overlooking the railway line. Could be a problem if you are a light sleeper. There are rooms that face away from the railway line. The window is able to be opened to get some fresh air.Like everywhere in China, you can not escape cigarette smoke. So expect to smell it in your non-smoking room. Try also to get a room away from the stairwells - again not a good option for light sleepers. There are no lifts, but the porter will take your luggage to your room.For the price, this is a great hotel. You can't go wrong.It is a bit of a walk to The Forbidden city, but you can catch the subway to it to save the walk.There are shops in the Henderson Centre across the road from the Railway station (cross the road via the foot bridge). A supemarket is also near by (Park and Shop) - in the building opposite the Hendersen Shopping centre to the east. When you cross the footbridge, turn right and cross the north / south road. Then head north and enter the shopping centre where you see Starbucks. Go one level down. It has everything you need.Hope this all helps my fellow travellers.Scott"

1,144,Oct 16 2009 	You Get What You Pay For	The price of the rooms at the Belair Hotel gives you some idea of what you will get. I was surprised that the rooms were in such good shape. The hotel is inexpensive and in a very active part of the city. The businesses and entertainment in the area are exceptional. There is good transportation all around the city from the hotel. Some of the staff could use lessons on professional courtesy. All in all I had a very good experience at the hotel. My room attendant Anne was exceptional! If I owned this business I would give her a raise. All in all for the money that I paid - I got good service.
2,144,May 30 2009 	DON'T EXPECT PROFESSIONALISM.	I am presently a tenant and am presently witnessing a lack of professionalism from the Manager (Dovie Williams) as well as the Owner ( Mr. Windmiller). I had a drug addicted alcoholic knock on my door in the middle of the night. I tried to communicate my problem to the owner by leaving a letter in his box. He did not respond. When I called him he said that he did want to deal with me and hang the phone in my face. **This place is a dump. The water for the entire building is turn off at least once a week patch up their archaic plumbing.**The water isnt good enough to brush your teeth with!**They charge $87 a night but there is no TV in the rooms.(They will rent you one though.)**There is no cable.**Don't use the Hotel room phones because clerks listen to your phone calls.**
3,144,"Jul 21 2008 	Check out the Belair	I moved to this hotel, after having a bad experience with a local hostel. My husband was a patient at St. Joseph's Hospital, and the Belair is only about 2 blocks away. It's an old hotel, but I found it to be comfortable and clean. I stayed in one of their overnight rooms, which had double bed, air conditioning, TV, and phone. These rent for $75/night. They also have rooms on a weekly or monthly basis, but these rooms lack TV and air conditioning. At $170-213/ week, they are a good deal, if you bring a fan. I think you can also pay a little extra for a fridge and microwave. The staff at the Belair were really nice, and the location, right next to Lincoln Park, was excellent."
4,144,"Oct 30 2007	It stinks - literally!!!	I only stayed there because the other short term choices did not have private baths. The best I can say about the Belair is that the staff was friendly and helpful. For starters, you have to provide your own TV. If you want reception you have to order your own cable. The building is old and stinks of mildew and mold. Under the bathroom sink the wall was full of black mold. They gave me a room two floors above a next door bar that on weekends had music blaring. For $188 a week it was not worth it."
5,144,"Aug 1 2007 	This place is a total stinky old overpriced DUMP!	If you are on drugs or crazy you will think this place is great but if you are sane you will hate it. I have never been in such a ran down, old, hot, dirty stanky, unsafe place in all of my life. Everything is old, musty and on the brink of falling apart. I was afraid I would catch lice the rooms were so dirty. Here's my warning to you---DO NOT stay at this place!"
6,144,"Jun 1 2007 	Top notch place smelled great too!	It was a very nice place, I would reccomend it to anybody. Lots of friendly faces . I was visiting Chicago from Pakistan . Only problem I had was men knocking on the door throughout the night. Lots of fine food places located nearby. I found my cousin Raj working in the subway nearby. Very clean beds and it made my vacation one of the best ever. Lots of fun bars not to far away either, I visited the Manhole club and stopped by the Steamworks,oh boy I will never forget that night."
7,144,"Mar 19 2007 	Will definitely come back	My three friends and I stayed at the Belair during the weekend of Pridefest (June 2006). We did not book a room before we arrived, but happened to find 2 available rooms here, at a much better price than the Days Inn down the street. The ladies behind the desk chatted with us and were very patient with my worn out credit card. Aside from being required to rent 2 rooms for the 4 of us (we absolutely could not have more than 2 people per room) the location was excellent. The parade went right in front of the building on W. Diversey, and the religious protesters were right across the street, making it more interesting. Close to gay bars on Halsted, Duffy's bar is right next door, Chipmunks restaurant (pizza, gyros), Walgreens, liquor store is very close (cheap beer, expensive cigarrettes), and 5 minute walk from Subway restaurant and transit lines. The rooms were clean and all of the fixtures worked. They were nothing special- just a bed, a chair, dresser, TV, and bathroom with bath/shower. They weren't too small and each has own bathroom. No bugs. Nothing was stolen from the room. All in all a good experience. We are planning to stay the Belair once again when we attend pride fest 2007."
8,144,"Oct 9 2006 	Buyer beware...	Since I chose this hotel partly based on a review I saw here, I feel obligated to add a review of my own. Needing a place to stay while I waited for a job interview, I had intended to stay here for several weeks. I splurged on the 2-room suite, with refrigerator and microwave, since I could then save some money on food. On the second day of my stay, the refrigerator door came off. Apparently, it was attached only by the top hinge, the bottom one being already off. When I reported this to the desk clerk, I was told it would be repaired. The next day, the manager accused me of vandalism and threatened to make me pay for the repairs. No repairs were made and when I checked out at the end of the week, I was again verbally abused by the manager and officially 'banned' from the premises.The rest of the staff - desk and housekeeping - are extremely courteous and professional. But the manager seems to have the policy 'you break it, you buy it.' So if you choose to stay here, be really, really careful"
9,144,"Oct 7 2004	The Belair:Off beat Friendly Cozy 	I actually have fond memories of the Belair Hotel. It was the 1st place I stayed at when I moved to Chgo 10 years ago. I didn't know a soul, I was low in funds, and my apt wasn't ready to move into. I was new to Chgo at the time, so I was a little frightened by the fast paced people. The residents though, turned out to be very nice people--a little avant gard and off the wall, but totally harmless. The ladies that worked behind the counter were very friendly, and treated me like they were my aunts.The hotel sort of had the feel of a dorm-like setting at an art school in New York's Village. Now that I'm considering moving back to Chgo, I think The Belair will once again be where I'll start out. It is within walking distance of pubs, restaurants, Walgreens, Lenscrafters, several bus stops, parks, a small supermarket, and STARBUCKS!!! As you walk down Diversey and turn onto Belmont, there are little shops and stores all along both sides of the street. There's just tons to do.Video stores and food delivery places make The Belair a cozy stay. There's nothing fancy here, but you will be safe and among people who will try to help you. I am starting over (again), and should I pick Chgo to come back to, I hope The Belair will welcome me back. Familiar hospitality is good ground to stand on."
10,144,"May 27 2004	One half step above a last resort	This place just barely gets a rating of 2. Based on the reviews above (Oct 16, 2002 + Oct 17, 2003) I went to view the available rooms at the Belair. Boy was I disappointed even though I consider my standards quite modest. They give you a key and you go up and check out the room(s) M-F 12-8 Sa 9-8. The room I saw was old and while it seemed somewhat clean it just had an overall look of dingy, dingy, dingy. It was one of the majority of rooms that are rented by the week/month. They have some few other rooms that rent by the night and possibly might be different. The room rate was $159/wk. At $259-299/wk the Chicago area Ext Stay America properties seem to me to have a vastly better bang per buck ratio. They do cost more and you need a car unless you stay at Ext Stay O'Hare and are willing to deal with a somewhat painful bus to CTA link to get you downtown."
11,144,Oct 17 2003	A Nice Place	My boyfriend used to live at this hotel and I was there often.It's a fairly nice place if all the other hotel's are booked. It's really clean and quiet.
12,144,"Oct 16 2002	If you need a bed and a hot shower...	We stayed here the weekend of the Chicago Marathon (as most everything else in the city was booked). The location is very nice (Lincoln Park) and the neighborhood is very safe. The hotel itself is old and actually even has residents (they are harmless although a bit strange). There are plenty of restaurants, cinemas and bars close by -you won't be confined to your room in other words. The rooms are very basic (no alarm clock, no extra pillows, 2 hangers) and as clean as they could be, given the fact that they are fairly old rooms. The bed was okay (thin mattress but thick comforter) and the shower worked quite well. All and all, it's like crashing at a college friend's old apartment."
1,146,Jul 17 2009 	Very Nice!!	Stayed here a few times and it was really clean and motel staff is really nice and helpful! its very cheap considering the area its in and the quality of the room.

5,146,May 31 2007 	The Bellwood is Delightful	Walked in with friends from out of town. We were met by a real friendly desk clerk and the manager of the hotel . Within minutes it felt like we had known these two forever. The manager Pat a very nice &quot;mother type&quot; lady knew all the things and places we should visit. She obviously loves her job and they went out of the way to make us feel welcome. The rooms are older but very clean and they actually smelled better than some of the upperclass hotels I have been in. Transportation a few feet away and we even got a map of the city!!!. For $50 a night you get more than you think you might. The warmth and kindness were worth more. Definately a great hidden treasure!!	
6,146,Dec 17 2006	Best kept secret in Lincoln Park	My room was freshly decorated and clean. The staff was helpful and attentive. I would definately stay there again. BTW

Not A ok but just Ok.Our room was not dirty and nasty as another reviewer said.. but they are in a very Old slightly disrepaired state..... but clean enough.My largest concern is the neighborhood. Although in transition upward.... In the block area next to the property there are a noticable amount of what appear to be mentally challenged people. talking to themselves

I had been trying to book flights out there from SD &amp; had talked to several different airlines to accomplish this, ontop of being sick with a cold, I was very frustrated with the treatment I had received over the phone. When I had called to make the resrevation the lady who answered the phone, was so polite, very friendly &amp; so helpful. I just could believe the difference. She made me feel so much better &amp; put my mind at ease about coming out there for my fathers surgery. She was OUTSTANDING and should be told. More people need to be like her. I look forward to meeting her in person when I'm out there in Oct."
3,155,"Jul 28 2009 	Typical Marriott comfort - nothing spectacular but nothing bad either...	Stayed for three nights with the UIC rate ($169/night).The good:+ Comfortable, clean, spacious room+ Conveniently located to UIC and 5 minutes from Taylor street (lots of restaurant options)+ Friendly staff+ Reasonable fitness room - ~6 pieces of cardio equipment and free weights with one bench+ Reasonably priced restaurant with good selection of options (for a hotel)The bad:+ Internet was wireless only and was not free - Marriott needs to differentiate itself by making this free across all of its brands. Internet access is now no longer the &quot;novelty&quot; it was two decades ago!+ No ability to turn up the heat - choice was either Air Conditioning (very cold) or no fan. I went with the latter..."
4,155,"Jul 9 2009 	Very nice hotel centrally located	My wife and I travelled to Chicago for a long weekend. We received this room from priceline.com for a wonderful discount. The hotal was very centrally located to everything we desired to do. We had no problems at all and the hotel was clean and as nice as other Marriots I have visited. Prices were slightly high, but that comes with staying at a Marriot."
5,155,"Jun 9 2009 	Good Hotel great location great value	I stayed at this hotel in June 2009 while in Chicago to attend a sporting event at Soldier Field. The hotel is located just outside the loop and to the south of a major highway.The hotel appears to have been recently renovated. The amenities are modern and new. The bathrooms are rather large and quite functional. The hotel is located in the heart of the medical district, and as a result there are not many restaurants or shops in the immediate area. The closest CTA station is the Polk station on the pink line, which is directly connected to the loop. The hotel does offer a shuttle that leaves every half hour to bring you to local restaurants as well as to the Racine stop on the blue line, which will bring you to O'Hare Airport.My only complaint was the air conditioning wasn't working properly in my end of the hotel, and the hotel maintenance was slow to fix it after numerous rooms complained about it. Otherwise, the hotel staff was knowledgeable and friendly, and the hotel is in an excellent location."
6,155,"Jun 4 2009 	Excellent	This hotel was excellent. Of course I say that given we booked the room through priceline at $60USD per night plus taxes. I would not pay the $350USD advertised on the website for the same time period.The actual hotel is quite modern or has been very recently updated. The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, but the actual size of the rooms are quite small in comparison to other hotels. If you're only sleeping the in hotel like we did then it's not really a big deal. The front desk staff are extremely helpful. I called ahead to request things such as king beds, late check out, adjoining rooms and such but for some reason the request was lost. None the less the front desk staff worked quickly to still provide us with every requested item including an early check in as we arrive 2 hours earlier then expected.This hotel is only a couple blocks from Polk subway station to get downtown and from Taylor street where you can easily grab something to eat/drink. The area around the hotel is very clean and safe as well. The only complaint I would have is the ambulence sirens that go off in the night. I heard them once a night but other sound sleepers didn't hear them at all. It really was only a couple seconds before they were gone and I was asleep again."
7,155,"Oct 22 2008 	The Price Was Right	We decided to take our three children to Chicago for our fall break. We booked the Marriott on Priceline for $115 a night. If you are going to the city to sightsee and shop, it's a fine hotel if you don't mind taking the public transportation into the city. You can easily take the train or the bus to Michigan Avenue in about 20-30 minutes. We didn't feel unsafe even coming back to the hotel at night. We basically used it as a place to sleep and went sightseeing and shopping all day. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel and they have a free shuttle that takes you to the nearby train stop. The front desk staff was excellent in helping us figure out what bus or train we needed to take to get to where we wanted to go. The lobby is nicely decorated. Our room was clean, but worn. The side chair in the room was so beat up that I'm really suprised that they hadn't hauled it to the dumpster. The beds were comfy. Suprisingly I only heard one siren in the middle of the night even though we were right across the street from the hospital. We parked in the hospital parking lot b/c that was only $13 a night and the hotel parking was $28. You don't have in and out priveleges at the hospital garage, but we used the bus/train to get around. Definitely not a 3.5 star like it is rated on Priceline, but we were happy with the money we saved by staying here and felt the staff was great."
8,155,"Oct 3 2008 	Not as Nice as the Typical Marriott	I stayed at this hotel for business at the end of September, into October, 2008. I thought the room was below average compared to the typical Marriott. The wallpaper was starting to peel in certain locations, the rug was a little worn, and the mattress was really hard. Also, I'm not sure if I was being more microscopic than usual, but I seemed to find lots of little hairs all over, including on the bedspread, pillows, and sheets. Perhaps the worst part of my experience was the noise. My room was facing the main road and Rush University is building a new hospital across the street from the hotel. On my first night, they were doing construction through the night and I had a tough time falling asleep. They did not work any of the other nights, but they did get started pretty early in the morning. Furthermore, there are a lot of other hospitals in the area (it's called Medical District for a good reason!) and I heard lots of ambulances throughout the night. Of course, I traveled with another person from my office and he did not complain of any noise, as his room was on a different side of the hotel and he could not hear the construction or ambulances.This hotel had a few positives, though. First and foremost, although you are not staying in the main Chicago downtown, there is a city bus line that is right outside the hotel and will take you downtown in less than 15 minutes for just two dollars each way. Also, you are in easy walking distance (about 3-4 blocks) of Little Italy where there are plenty of interesting local restaurants to dine at, and you can also walk to the Jewel-Osco supermarket. The hotel staff was very helpful, too. A worker at the front desk very happily printed out my airplane boarding pass for me (the free computer in the lobby - only for printing out boarding passes and not for free internet surfing - was not working) and she also reserved a shuttle for my trip back to O'Hare.If you plan on visiting Chicago for pure leisure, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. You'd be much better off staying in &quot;The Loop&quot; (the main downtown area), but if you have business to attend to on the South Side, I'd check this hotel out."
9,155,"Sep 1 2008 	Functional place to stay in Chicgo	We spent 3 nights here for our son's wedding, occupying 2 rooms with other family members and friends also staying. For $140/night in the Chicago area, it wasn't a bad value. The hotel is not downtown, but downtown is easily accessible by car (not recommended) or train.We found the employees to all be very friendly, pleasant and helpful. The breakfast, while pricey as one would expect in a chain hotel in a major city, wasn't exorbitant and was a pleasant buffet. On site parking is expensive at $28/day, but there really is not much other choice."
10,155,Aug 12 2008 	Chicago baseball weekend	My 13-year-old son and I stayed for a baseball weekend. The hotel is conveniently located between Wrigley and US Cellular. I was looking for a reasonable and safe place to stay and I was very pleased. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. An east / west and north / southbound bus is available right outside the door. The &quot;L&quot; is a friendly shuttle away. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a simply lovely experience in Chicago right outside the hustle and bustle of the city.
11,155,"Aug 3 2008 	Great restaurtant/Bar/Breakfast - noisy room!	The breakfast was excellent, as was the menu for lunch and evening dinner and I had a delicious steak there. Friendly bar staff.Used their free shuttle servicve to take me back and forwards to the UIC for a conmference - they never ran it when you wanted to so you often had to take a taxi, but at &lt;$10 a go, hardly painful. They dropped me off at the train station to take the subway to O'Hare airport - this is the ONLY way to do it - costs $2 and is direct and goes straight past teh traffic that you can see sitting stationary on the motorway and beats the $50 taxi fare it took to get to the hotel (off peak, arriving at 23:00hrs).The room was problematic - VERY noisy. Being in medical district, there were loud sierens and the air con unit made a racket - even when it was switched off, it whirred away so I'm glad I took ear plugs.The saving grace were the staff in the bar/restaurant.Not very convenient for going out and about in the evening - although within walking distance of Little Italy which did look ok, but I woulnd't have wanted to stray too far off the main road as the area looked a little rough."
12,155,"Jun 7 2008 	Perfect Property and Location	I've stayed at this Marriot property on several occasions and it never disappoints. The rooms are comfortable, the staff is excellent, and the location (West Loop - Little Italy - Greektown) is ideal. The proximity to the best restaurants (Rosebud - amazing Italian; Illinois Bar and Grill on Taylor - Best hamburger in the entire universe; Yummi Thai - fabulous pad Thai and my favorite Tiger w/ shrimp; and, Drum and Monkey - cold beer and good people), multiple Chicago El/train stops, and just a short taxi/bus/train ride to the Magic Mile can all be found at the Marriott Chicago Downtown Medical District/UIC. The free shuttle service is a real bonus if you just don't enjoy walking the beautiful Chicago neighborhoods. By the way, the desk clerk, Victoria, is a real sweet heart."
13,155,"Apr 28 2008 	Only if you want to be near RUSH Medical Center	This is like a low budget Marriot. Clean but the hotel had few amenities. Unless you want to be across the street from University of Illinois or RUSH medical center, do not use this hotel. The online information gave me the impression that getting into downtown and the loop was just a few easy trainstops down the road. Kind of true....it's two blocks to the train station and then several stops to downtown; it takes long enough that you don't want to go back and forth for the day, so you have to schlep all your stuff with you. My son lives in Chicago, and he did not advise that I (or any woman on her own) take the train at night, so that meant high taxi bills to get back. Others may disagree with the safety issue; hard to know when you don't live there. Anyway...the main problem is that this hotel is far from anything interesting. Also, the concierge was sweet but she really knew very little. She told me the wrong bus line, etc.Here is what I learned this trip: If you are going to bid on Priceline, do not include areas that you are not 100% sure of and don't go below four stars. I've gotten incredible deals that way, but this time, I lost out. Lesson learned."
14,155,"Mar 1 2008 	very comfortable	We had a very comfortable stay here and encountered no problems. They have a convenient no charge shuttle to several points which we took and then walked to our destination from there. We had breakfast at their restaurant and were not pleased with the choices or prices. They have a large variety of restaurant menus to choose from that would deliver, at their reception desk. We chose a Tai restaurant one night that was excellent. It was overall a pleasant experience."
15,155,"Sep 9 2007 	Great stay	I went to Chicago to go to a club with a bunch of friends for the weekend. We decided to stay here because it was very well priced. There are lots of good things to say about this hotel. The rooms were big and clean. The bedroom had two big comfy beds. The bathroom had: shampoo, conditioner, soap, and lots of towels. The only negative is it is VERY hard to catch a cab outside of the hotel. During the day, it is a short walk to the subway, but it didn't feel safe enough to catch a train at night. The desk staff was very good about getting cabs."
16,155,"Aug 23 2007 	Got checked into someone else's room!	Well when we checked into the hotel, my first impression was, wow ok better then I expected. The lobby was nice with some comfy chairs to seat in. Then we got all checked in and headed upstairs to our room. Guess what! The room was already occupied!! They had checked us into a room that had someone in it. Thank God that person wasn't in the room at the time, because that would have been relativly uncomfertable... Anyway we headed back down to the lobby to get a different room. What we had expected was an upgrade or a night free or something of the sort, but no, all we got was an apology. In our second room things weren't that great. There was a ciggarette hole in the curtains, the carpet was falling apart in one area, the bathroom door handle was broken, it was almost impossible to get cold water from the faucet, and the faucet squeaked VERY loudly. Our first night we noticed you can hear EVERYTHING that happens in the halls, people were out there all night long banging on doors and talking loudly. And, while I'm sure it was nice, the breakfast buffet in the adjoining restuarant was $25, which is absoulutly rediculous!There are some redeeming qualities of the hotel however, it was decorated very nicely and only 3 blocks from an el station, which was wonderful, we didn't have to use our car all weekend. And it's only a block or two away from a cafe called Pompeii which was delicious! And on the same street (Taylor, I think) there were many restaurants including the orginal Rosebud's and Starbucks. But being the Medical District you are right across the street from The Rush Medical Center, which could be good for some, but not us. The ambulance entrance was right across the street."
17,155,"Aug 20 2007 	Clean Friendly Staff Classy Decor	A friend booked some rooms for us for an overnight in Chicago as we were visiting some museums, etc. What a pleasant surprise to have such a nice clean hotel with the friendliest and most helpful staff, from the front desk to the valets to the cleaning staff. All were well spoken, excellent grammar, friendly, polite, smiling. The front desk personnel were most helpful in assisting us to locate restaurants in the area providing menus, free shuttle service, etc. The parking at the hotel is a little steep ($26) plus tips, but the service was excellent and worth the money. I would definitely stay here again."
18,155,"May 16 2007 	Great Service Average Hotel	I recently stayed at this hotel for business. For business purposes, especially if you are working in the area this hotel is fine, your average marriott, nothing that special. The rooms are comfortable but dated. The beds are very comfortable and the a.c worked well, I had no problem sleeping. The bathrooms are a bit dated and small but you can work with it. The internet is WiFi and a bit slow but it does ok. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and makes a big difference here when rating this hotel. Otherwise the rooms are basic, a bit dated, a little worn but comfortable. Its fine if you have something going on in the area, but if your in Chicago for anything other then business in the area you might want to look elsewhere."
19,155,"Jan 20 2007	Nice hotel overall for business travelers tourists should look elsewhere	Just stayed here a few weeks ago and this hotel was quite nice inside. No pool, but nice workout center. The service at the desk was good, but the valet was HORRIBLE. Had to sit in my car for several minutes and then finally got out and walked up to him (he was on his phone) and he said &quot;just leave it, I got it&quot;. Same thing happened when I was leaving (on his phone) and he didn't bother to help me with all the luggage I had or anything. They don't offer self-parking either, so be prepared for the hefty 21 dollar valet charge. This hotel is convienent to the UIC campus, but there are better hotels that are much closer to things so I would discourage you from coming to this hotel unless for business. It is convienent to the expressway/loop."
20,155,"Nov 1 2006 	Hot apple cider and cookies	Stayed here 3 weekend nights, got a great deal on Priceline. Staff were great on arrival, very friendly, very quick check-in. Room was very large, 2 Queen size beds (unusual for big city hotel) and immaculately clean. Beds were so comfortable and best pillows ever (according to my wife)Although not quite city centre, still very central (opposite Rush medical centre). Taxis were cheap, $8 to Sears Tower, $9 to downtown, $11 to Rush and Division for nightlife, $13 to Navy Pier. Little Italy is only about a 10 minute walk.One very nice gesture was the complimentary hot apple cider and homemade cookies awaiting guests in the foyer. It was very cold outside so it was greatly appreciated.Also breakfast buffet ($11, i think), was excellent. Great porridge and proper sausages.Overall this is a superb 3 star hotel (could easily be 4 star). Had a great stay and would heartily recommend."
21,155,"Sep 28 2006 	A clean room only minutes away from dowtown	Went with five couples overnight. Four of us stayed here. Rooms were nice and clean. The hotel is not a 5-star, nor does it claim to be. Would definitely go back again. Only 2 blocks from the CTA's L train that will take you downtown in 10 minutes for very reasonable - $2.00/person one way, much cheaper than parking downtown or taking a taxi. If you are looking for the downtown Chicago hotel experience with a view, this isn't it. If you are looking for a reasonable, clean room for quite a bit less &amp; only minutes away, this is the one. It definitely met our expectations."
22,155,"Jul 5 2006	Better than expected Loved the Shuttle Good Value	I got this hotel through Priceline for an excellent price, given that I was there for a holiday weekend. At first I had some misgivings about location and the ease with which I would be able to get dowtown for inside the loop activities. Luckily, it was much easier than I had expected.The hotel is about .5 miles from the Racine Blue Line stop, so it's not too bad of a walk. If you are not a walker, there is a hotel shuttle bus that will take you to and from the train station for free. The shuttle takes hotel guests within a 1 mile radius of the hotel, so it won't take you all the way downtown, but will take you to the train station, restaurants (Giordano's was great!), Little Italy, Greektown, the hospitals, Harpo studios, etc., all of which are within 1 mile. I had no car and a CTA train pass and things worked out very well. Whenever we called the shuttle for a pick up, it never took more than 10-15 minutes, and the shuttle drivers were very helpful and full of suggestions for tourists. The hotel itself was nice, typical Marriott quality. The front desk staff were curteous and helpful. We had a non-smoking room, but it smelled a bit of old smoke, so that was a minus. The room was large and the amenities were good (Bath &amp; Body Works toiletries, cofee/tea in room, good tv channel selection, excellent bed/linens). Another bonus is there is free internet access in the lobby and in the business center for guests. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised. I would certainly consider staying here again. Not the best hotel if you want to be right in the heart of the loop and near all the attractions, but well worth it for the price. A nice respite from the downtown hustle and bustle, but still close enough to be convenient."
23,155,"Oct 18 2005	Definitely a very high 3 if not 4 star hotel	I am a frequent visitor to Rush hospital cancer treatment center. Many times I would rather not fight with the rush hour traffic so I began staying at this hotel right acrass the street. The shuttle will take you to the hospital, although it runs on a 1/2 hr schedule. Yuo can park in the parking ramp to avoid the $26 a night valet parking fee (Only parking offered). The hospital information desk sells parking passes for $20.00 for 5 stays, each stay 24 hrs or less per pass. The hotel is very elegant and beautifully decorated. The rooms arent overly large but spacous enough. The beds are top quality pillow top mattresses with super fluffy comforters. Rooks,the gourmet resturaunt on the first level, has a wide variety on the menu and also supplies a more limited menu for room service of excellent quality and less expensive than you would expect. Some rooms are business oriented with a nice work area with extra outlets. If you get a business room look at your bill because the computer system automatically adds $9.95 to your bill for wireles internet access. They have a few discounts for RUSH patients and prospective staff members but even without a discount I think you would be hard pressed to find a better/cheaper cost same quality hotel anywhere this close to the loop. The staff is completely professional, Kind and courteous From the valet to the Room service waitor and everyone in between. Aside from the few quirks (parking and internet things) This hotel is definitely worth planning a stay. I Am staying therelater today. K Gilgan"
24,155,"Sep 15 2005 	Very Nice	An outstanding room and a great night of sleep. The bed and comforter were top notch, the room was modern with all of the conveniences. Clean facilities. Service at the restaurant was a little slow, but the food was good. Not inexpensive (this is Chicago). Id stay here again."
25,155,"May 30 2005	Very Nice Hotel	Great hotel! It was very clean and the room was extremely comfortable. The pillows were soft and fluffy and the sheets and blankets were wonderful. They were also able to give us a ride downtown in the hotel's van, which was very nice. I would definetly stay here again even though it is not in the heart of downtown. Parking is expensive, but you will find that at most hotels."
26,155,"Oct 29 2004	Stay here if you are interviewing for a UIC position	Stayed here while interviewing for a residency spot at UIC. Clean. Friendly. Very close. Resident recruitment rate of $119/night. I was under the impression you'd get free internet via ethernet cables, but you have to pay $10 per day to rent a wireless password.Nice bar with a friendly bartender, also from Hawaii. Breakfast is tasty in the Rooks Corner restaurant."
27,155,"Sep 8 2004	Excellent hotel!	We stayed at the Marriott for two nights for a getaway into the city and though we were slightly disappointed when booking this hotel that it was the only Marriott property available in the city during the dates we were going, we were quite pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the hotel. This property is an oasis of calm on the edge (about 1 mile or 2 'L' stops from the Loop) of a lively, yet sometimes chaotic city. The lobby is done in warm, dark woods and resembles the den of Sherlock Holmes. Our guestroom was clean and comforable, with a primitive art (Egyptian-Sumerian style) adorning the walls.The location, in a safe neighborhood only blocks from Little Italy and Greektown on the Near West Side, is very easily accessable to the rest of the city via L and taxi. The hotel also offers a shuttle service between the hotel and the loop, as well as the Racine &quot;L&quot; stop.Cash-paying guests should be advised that the hotel levies a $30 refundable security deposit.We will return to this hotel as a quieter alternative to the noisy and often cacauphonous Loop/River North properties."

The hotel was nothing like their web site claimed- they said spa- and three stars- I would not give it one star- my room was filthy with a broken bed with flithy sheets- - had to wait hours for a new one and the ac did not work- none of the promised items were there- pool had been closed for months- no business office- called my business associate who called and reported them- said it should be closed for health reasons-had to sleep elsewhere- no refund- - they claimed in their web it was newly decorated- but it was a mess and old- others staying there were very upset they also thought it would be nice- but was NOT- the last nite I did get a kind employee who found me a better room- actually had working ac! I was told by one employee new owners - staff is tryin
2,157,"Oct 13 2009 	This Hotel is a Dump	This hotel is a dump. None of the stuff listed is available. There is no fitness room, sauna, or restaurant. No fridge, no coffee maker, the list goes on. It isn't clean. The wallpaper is peeling and the walls are cracking. There is graffiti on the walls of the halls and the doors. I stepped on broken glass in my room. The guy behind the desk is proudly displaying his prison tattoos. The &quot;Free Breakfast&quot; is coffee and pre packaged Danishes in sticky (on the outside) cellophane wrappers. Apparently the only way to use the internet is to sit in the lobby. This is one serious dump."
3,157,"Oct 11 2009 	Marginal at best!	We chose this hotel because it was cheap but we should have payed a little more for something better! To put it into prospective, it's right next to Hooters... The hotel's pool had been closed for over a year, the bistro had been closed since 4/1/09 and the free wireless internet they advertise is only available in the entrance area! Their website advertises $50/night rates which is quite false (we payed over $100/night). Our room didn't have the advertised mini-fridge, hair-dryer (we had to go down and ask for it), or dvd player. A little on the scary side, we saw the front desk guy give a bunch of his drunk/high friends a key without them paying for it. I guess if you want to stay for the airport service, they apparently have a shuttle... but I still wouldn't recommend it!"
4,157,"Oct 1 2009 	SOOOOOOOOO BAD!!!	This place was so gross. We needed to stay at a place close to the airport as we were only in town for 13 hrs and had to catch a early flight. I booked this room as the photos on Priceline were not bad at all, however i should have known better. First of all.... the shuttle is a rusted out van that smells awful inside. Thank god it was a free shuttle service. When we pulled up to the hotel we found it not to be in the nicest neighborhood and the exterior of the hotel was nasty. The only nice area of this hotel is the lobby as its the only area that has been updated. The room was so nasty and dirty... the AC didnt work and the shower did not work at all. I called the front desk and they said it would take 25-30 mins. before someone could come look at it... never once offered us a new room. We were unable to wait for someone to come fix the shower as we were in a hurry to get to a concert and we would NOT let any of the employees into the room with out us being there. The only nice thing about this hotel is the fact that the shuttle is free and runs every half hour. I found that you get what you pay for !! Do not waste your money at this place!!!"
5,157,"Sep 10 2009 	Good for a short budget trip to Chicago!	For under $30 a night per person (I shared with two others), you can't really go past this hotel, it was clean and a 10 minute walk from the blue line train. While not really in the heart of the city, it was definately worth the travel time for the price! Basic tea and coffee is available, and &quot;breakfast&quot; - doughnuts or prepackaged pastries, which weren't that great but again you can't really complain for how much you're paying. The shower taps are a bit tricky to get the hang of too, but that was the only trouble we had."
6,157,"Aug 26 2009 	Beware of this hotel!!!!!	Do not stay here if you value hygiene and cleanliness.There are too many complaints to list, so I have chosen the ones I consider most important.Everywhere smiltCarpets stained and filthyBed linen did not look cleanFridge filled with dirty glassesShower didn't work properlyLights went off when hairdryer usedMachine for cold drinks had dirty piece of towelling stuck up itKit Kat from other machine melted, you could have eaten it with a spoonBreakfast - coffee and doughnuts that were falling off a plate on to grubby clothThere was one point in its favour, the friendliness of the guy who picked us up from the airport, but the vehicle certainly needed attention. From 2 very unhappy people from the UK"
7,157,"Aug 26 2009 	An avalanche of one bad thing after another	For the first time in my life I feel like I really need to let others know that this is not a good option. First of all, we selected this hotel based on the distance to O'hare Intl Airport, price and the fact that the photos didn't show a bad hotel at all. We had never been to Chicago but thought the surrounding neighborhood looked a little dirty. The two members of the hotel staff that we interacted with were not friendly at all and the hotel smelled. We ended up going to two different rooms before we checked out to go to another hotel: Room #1 - the bathroom had mold all over the walls and tile plus the floor of the tub looked like it had never been cleaned; also one of the lamps in the room didn't work and the room was way too dark. Then we let them know and they gave us a new room. Room #2 - the bathroom was better than the first one but still had mold and was kinda dirty looking plus the sink faucet would never shut off. There were white liquid stains on the headboard and carpet. What made us decide that we needed to leave was finding cat feces behind the lounge chair in the room. How in the world do you get &quot;cat poop&quot; in a hotel room?! Further, how often do they clean their rooms? We had our 8 month old baby with us and decided that we needed a better place to stay. We probably would have stayed if we didn't have the baby but, with a child, conditions like that are unacceptable. We went to the Hampton Inn at Schiller Park, IL. Hampton Inn has never disappointed us and we have decided that it's worth paying more for a clean hotel with friendly staff and free breakfast and internet."
8,157,"Aug 20 2009 	Do not stay here!!!!!! It's filthy and the shuttle bus is non - existent	I travelled to Chicago to meet up with family and needed to stay near the airport for one night before travelling on to my destination. I chose this hotel as Expedia had listed it as being near the airport, at a reasonable cost.On arrival at O'Hare airport I contacted the hotel by phone to enquire about their free airport shuttle service. The lady that answered the phone was very casual and told me to &quot;go to the shuttle stop and wait and that's it&quot;. It required me to grill her before she indicated where the shuttle stop was or how I might recognise their shuttle bus. When I got to the shuttle stop there were numbered doors to indicate where to wait for the shuttles of each hotel, the helpful lady on the phone had not informed me of which number door I should wait at. I did wait, very patiently, for over an hour, at which point my patience ran out and I caught a cab to the hotel, which cost $20.On arrival at the hotel, which is actually a motel, I explained to the lady at the front desk that I had waited over an hour for the shuttle, to which she replied, &quot;I don't know what happened there, I told the driver&quot;. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told that she would not be available for 2 days.I was given my key and lazily pointed in the direction of my room.The journey to my room left me dreading what I would find once I finally got there. The corridors of the motel were filthy, with stains and rubbish in abundance. The room, although not outright dirty, felt unclean and was very dark due to poor lighting.They advertise a contintental breakfast, which is actually a sickly doughnut in plastic wrapping, which you can buy in Walmart 16 for $3.In conclusion this MOTEL is terrible and should not even be considered as a one night stop for the airport."
9,157,"Aug 11 2009 	Pretty awful	We got a room at the Garden Hotel so we could park our car there and fly from there. We are not &quot;hotel snobs&quot; and weren't expecting anything fancy for the price, but the place is awful. It smells bad, everything is stained and dirty. There's an abandoned restaurant in the middle of the hotel; the pool out back is empty and surrounded by weeds. There was mold growing everywhere in the bathrooms. We realized our &quot;king&quot; bed was actually two twin beds pushed together. It was all I could do to actually convince my wife to go through with spending the night before our early morning flight the next day. We went out and watched a late movie at a nearby theater so we could spend as little time at the hotel as possible. When we got back at the end of the trip, our cab dropped us off to pick up our car. Several employees were sitting outside with their cars (and the hotel shuttle van). The entrance drive was completely blocked as a result, and when our cab driver asked if they could move so he could drive through, they rudely they wouldn't move and that he should just back out.Pay an extra $20 or so to stay somewhere else."
10,157,"Aug 1 2009 	Discusting!	This place is [--] gross!Its cheap but nasty!Its SOOOOO Dirty. Smells SOOO Bad! Stained carpet, needs painting.... Do not use this hotel!"
11,157,Jul 23 2009 	Great Shuttle Service	We reserved a room here through parksleepfly.com. We usually book a room near the airport with free parking for our trips. We've stayed twice and both times had a good experience. This hotel is an old holiday inn. It's not the most beautiful hotel but perfect for our needs. We usually have an early flight so we stay the night before. The shuttle to the airport is on time and only about 10 minutes or less to get there. In fact we took the 5:30 shuttle. They made an extra trip to take a couple who had overslept and were going to miss their flight. They still made it back before 5:30 for us. On the way back we called from baggage claim and they were waiting for us when we made it over to the pick-up area. The check in desk is efficient. The price is cheaper than parking at the airport and they had hot coffee and small pastries in the lobby when we left in the morning. I think the only complaint I have is that the floor of the bathtub in our room was grimey looking.
12,157,"Jul 8 2009 	Not a Romantic Getaway	My experience was alot like the others on this site. Stay here only if you're looking for bare-bones budget accomodations. It's not a great place to stay in the hotel room enjoying yourself.The price was good, I'll give them that, but I'd have rather paid an extra ten bucks and had a firmer mattress and a carpet without stains."
13,157,"Jul 6 2009 	NASTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	My husband left it to me to find a hotel room we just needed for one night- before leaving on vacation. I wanted to save some money so I went with a cheap hotel. The picture that I did see online looked ok- so I was set. We checked in- lobby appeared to be clean. Lobby restrooms were very nice. And then there was our actual hotel room. yi yi yi. The first thing we saw was the bed... the pathetic looking bed. You could tell by looking at it, how it swooped way down in the middle- that it wasn't going to be good. (The sheets had nasty stains on them- we asked for clean sheets and we never received them! HOW RUDE!) We tried sleeping horizontally, vertically, diagonally... nothing worked. Before we attempted to sleep, we attempted to take a shower. The drain was clogged terribly, the shower curtain rod was about to fall out of the wall, thus the curtain would not stay shut and water was getting out. (There was only 1 wash cloth in the room when we got there... really? So we had to requset more.) The &quot;complimentary&quot; shampoo was less than 1/2 full- and who knows with what. We used the shuttle- if you can call it that. The driver was nice, the vehicle was creepy. Tape holding things together, the seat wouldn't latch in, so on the stop and go's around chicago were real fun, and it was just filthy. Needless to say, I have been banned from picking out hotels from now on. I hope this review helps- take our word... DO NOT STEP FOOT INTO THIS PLACE!!!"
14,157,"Jun 17 2009 	Good value and location	I was scared after reading all the negative reviews. But for a 2-star type of hotel, it fits the bill closely. The prices are quite low so it is a good value for what you get considering the location. The wi-fi only works in the lobby, but is reliable and very fast. In fact most hotel wifi is spotty/laggy, but this is one of the fastest ones I have used. Rooms are decent with some minor renovations. Bed was a bit saggy, but that I find in all 3-star and lower hotels. There was not much noise at all in the hotel. Most of the clientle seemed foreign travelers who seemed well mannered and quiet. The parking lot had plenty of spaces and there was no charge for it."
15,157,"Jun 7 2009 	WORST hotel EVER!!!	I used to stay here in 2008 and the property was well-maintained and everything in working order. I have stayed twice this year and every stay was absolutely HORRIBLE! In March I stayed for 5 days and each day I had to be moved to another room because there were major items missing from the room or they stopped working or broke. After contacting the manager I was offered a refund. It's now June and I haven't seen 1 cent returned!!!! Nothing works anymore in the rooms, everything is falling apart, wallpapaer peeling in every room, showers are either extremely hot or freezing cold, wifi only works in the lobby, t.v. starts making gold awful sounds if on for more then 30 minutes, no blow dryers/coffeemaker/microfridge or any other amenities they claim to have! I'd rather take my chances at a Motel 6!!!"
16,157,"Jun 3 2009 	hotel from hell	From day one it was a nightmare the hostess the room smelled like feet and everything else the bed was slumpy and smelled too the hallway was scary the breakfast was a joke all the way to the end the hostess who supposed to be nice and smile 'NOT'??? ,very disatisfied never go back and if you dare to stay there your on your own.Oh and watch out for the t.v. it has a mind of its own.............jo"
17,157,"May 29 2009 	Decent Budget Option	We stayed here for one night between a Ben Harper concert and a cubs game, got in about 1AM and were out by 9AM. The parking lot leaves a bit to be desired, but it's close to a few decent restaurants, fairly quiet, and most of all, CHEAP! I was worried after reading reviews, but the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and the rooms weren't great, but they were more than fine for the night. My biggest annoyances were flat sheets on the beds (they don't stay put) and thin blinds (especially on the east side of the building, the sun will wake you up), but all in all I was happy for what it was. No comment on security since we didn't ever leave anything unattended in the room, but for an overnight, worth the money."
18,157,"May 27 2009 	Stay here only for the price ... if you pay more than $45 you paid too much	As a budget traveler what I'm looking is an economical comfortable problem free place to stay and as long as I get that I'd be happy. My verdict after staying here is that unless saving money is your number one concern then go elsewhere.I stayed here 5 nights after booking on Orbitz where the 5th night was free and with a $75 coupon ( you can always find some coupon code for Orbitz for multiple night stays ) the total cost came to $30 a night, including taxes!I arrived at the hotel close to 11p.m. to check in and commented to the clerk that as was listed on the Orbitz hotel room description that I wanted a room with a microwave and fridge. The clerk responded Orbitz should not be listing those on the room description and that they have no way of knowing which rooms have them! The clerk asked me what I wanted to do about this problem, and I said I was willing to go to the room to see if it had a fridge. This was not acceptable to her and once again she asked me what I wanted to do without an ounce of any regard for customer service in her demeanor. Now I am not the most demanding person and always treat people with politeness and I can say this was the worst customer service I have ever encountered from anyone in the service industry.Finally she offered to have the shuttle bus driver look in the room when in got back from the airport in 15 minutes.Twenty minutes later the clerk summoned me from the couch in the lobby to inform me that the room did not have a fridge, but I could come to the front desk at 7 a.m. the next day and maybe they could find me a new room with fridge.Resigned to take the room on offer, what do I find upon entering the room. A fridge!The room itself was okay, seemed clean enough and bug free. The bathroom mirror had a large crack and the bottom of the bathtub for mushy underfoot as though nothing was supporting it. The bed sheets had many holes and cigarette burns and the TV was classic budget hotel style about a 20 inch CRT probably a number of years old. There was free internet but you could only pick up the wireless signal from the lobby area. The bed was very soft ( or worn out? ) and sagged greatly. I had hurt my back a few days before and found after the first night's sleep my back was now worse! For the rest of the stay I had to avoid sleeping on my back.Room service had the annoying habit of knocking on the door at 8:30 in the morning and if you weren't ready for them your room was likely not to be attended too later. I took to the habit of taking my own clean towels from the carts left in the hallway.My overall impression is that after changing hands from Holiday Inn to Wyndham to now being independent that this hotel is being run into the ground, with the minimum amounts spent on maintenance or staff.As for the area, it was a safe neigbourhood. There are limited restaurants within walking distance. A Hooters in next door, an Outback Steak house a short distance east, a thai restaurant and a breakfast and lunch only diner across the street to the west. There is also a Dominick's Supermarket at the intersection of Cumberland and Higgins. TIP- if you need a 1-day CTA pass you can get them here, most CTA stations don't sell them.The hotel is a full 5-minute walk to the Cumberland CTA (public transit) metro station, and to get there you must walk along portions with no sidewalk ( gets muddy when it rains) and cross a busy intersection where drivers are not paying attention for pedestrians - as there are so few. Be careful. Or you can park in the lot for $4 for up to 12 hours or have the shuttle driver take you.The Blue Line runs 24 hours a day and takes about 35 minutes to the LOOP or less than 10 minutes to Ohare aiport. If you are taking the &quot;EL&quot; downtown please be advised that during the spring / summer of 2009 they are working on the line on most weekends from 10 p.m. Friday to 4:00 a.m. Monday and so during these times you must transfer to a bus to take you into the Loop. After they finish upgrading the line sometime later this year the ride downtown should only take 30 minutes.Overall I would not want to stay here again , but considering the price was less than a hostel might charge you for a non-private room without a bathroom, maybe I might consider this place for a traveler needing to save money as #1 priority."
19,157,"Apr 26 2009 	Horrible Hotel	We just completed (me, my wife and two other couples) our stay at this hotel and I could not wait to write this review. For the price I was not expecting the Ritz, but this was just horrible. I actually lost all hope when the picked us up in a dilapidated white van. When we got to the hotel the receptionist was rude and actually acted put out by checking us in. The room smelled musty and moldy in fact we had to switch rooms after the first night because the hot water in the bathroom sink faucet and hair dryer did not work. The second room was not much better. The AC worked sporadically. As others have stated the internet was still down as of April 26th. The continental breakfast consisted of stale packaged donuts and less than average coffee. When they clean the rooms the large full garbage bags sit in the halls for a day or so. My wife and I requested other pillow (only three provided) that never showed up even after two requests. Our last night (Saturday) my wife was pretty sure she saw a prostitute leaving out the front door which would not surprise me. The other two couples we visited Chicago with reported similar room conditions and were just as unhappy. The owners and staff (except for one shuttle driver who was actually very nice) of this hotel just do not seem to care. My goal is to get the word out this hotel on every blog and review site I can so other people do not make the same mistake we did. The only bright side of the hotel was Spuntino Pizza directly across the street which served both the best stuffed and thin crust pizza I have ever had at a very reasonable price."
20,157,"Apr 20 2009 	One Word ""Horrible.""	I made this reservation online through Expedia.com. The outside of the hotel is deceiving. It looks okay, but when I went in to check in, OMG! It was smokey and the office behind the desk was filthy. The garbage was overflowing and it looked like the floor was never vacuumed. When I got my room key, on the way up the stairs, the floors were not vacuumed, the hallway walls were scuffed and the wallpaper was peeling off the walls and the doors were dirty with scuff marks and dirt. Window seals were full of cobwebs and the floors on the way to the room looked like they were never shampooed. When we got to the room, which was supposed to be non-smoking, it reeked of smoke. The bottom drawer of the chest was missing and the floors were dirty and the windows were greasy looking. I went back to the desk and complained and they changed the room to the first floor. I went to my conference and when I came back at night, all of the doors on the main floor were open, main door, fire exits, emergency exits, all of the ones on the first floor were open. No screens on the entry of the doors just wide open. Anything could come in the hotel, animals, bugs, etc. I did not feel safe in the hotel because anyone could come in at any time. Housekeeping was not 24 hours. They were not there at night. What kind of hotel doesn't have 24 hour housekeeping. This one doesn't, that's for sure. I was fed up, I checked out the same night. I refuse to lay my head down in such a disgusting and filthy place. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I was embarrased to have my friends to come visit me at this place when I was there. I complained to Expedia.com and they refunded my money and I told them to take this hotel off of their list because it would make them look really bad if they recommend this hotel to anyone. I arrived there at 3:00 p.m. and I left at 9:30 p.m. to drive back home from Illinois to Michigan that night. I refused to stay there."
21,157,"Apr 6 2009 	You get what you pay for	The room rate was cheap, and that is exactly how I would characterize the hotel. Least firm hotel bed I've ever tried to sleep on, seemed you had to pay for basic tv, and bottom bed sheet wasn't fitted so slid off all night. Luckily, we only needed the room from 9pm to 4am because we were using it as park,sleep and fly. Only nice thing about the place is the shuttle driver - exceptionally nice and helpful man. We probably save $30-50 staying at this place as opposed to another O'Hare area hotel, and in the future that savings wouldn't be worth it to me. Won't stay there again."
22,157,"Apr 5 2009 	they charged me for parking!!!	I made my reservation online and there was no information about the charge for parking. When I went to the hotel, they told me that I have to pay 8 dollars for parking. I told them that I have not seen any information about this charge online, but they still wanted me to pay for that. Of course, I had no choice to go to another hotel since it was already late. It was a rip off. DO NOT go there. The hallway to my room was smelling weird!!!"
23,157,"Mar 30 2009 	My Red digital camera got stolen by the room service!!!!!	This is the worst place I ve ever stayed!Room services checked out my stuff without my permission and my camera was stolen!My bag was unzipped too! and now they are saying that once I signed the paper to stay there, they are not responsible for it! How in the world this happend?! I am so pissed off and Im gonna accuse of this case!"
24,157,"Mar 3 2009 	Only one problem....Bugs!	At first it seamed like a decent hotel. The free breakfast was good, the shuttle was very fast dropping us off at O'hare and picking us up. But on the flight to our vacation I started noticing bumps on my legs they started then and only got worse. I later found out they were bites from BED BUGS!"
25,157,"Feb 22 2009 	Front Desk Help Are Thieves	We booked the Park &amp; Fly rate for a night before flying to Mexico. The room was dirty and had obviously been broken into since the door frame was repaired. Our stay was pretty quiet. It wasn't until we returned from Mexico that we discovered that a hotel employee had stolen our credit card number. While we were in Mexico someone was running around having a good time at other hotels in Chicago: The 'W' Lakeshore and the Aloft O'Hare. We were hit for nearly $1200. The O'Hare Garden was uncooperative in our efforts to catch the thief and we still don't know which employee took the information. For those who are wondering why we know it was an employee of this hotel, it was the only place we used the card in Chicago that the card left our sight. Watch your card activity if you stay here."
26,157,"Dec 22 2008 	Very Good and Nice Hotel	After reading a lot of bad reviews on this website I was panicked about choosing this hotel, but to my surprise this hotel was great! Clean, comfortable bed, good location, very friendly staff, NO bad smell, NO cockroaches! I stayed for 7 nights. Near to train station CTA (5 to 8 min. walking), restaurants, supermarket, airport (O'Hare). This is a very nice and cheap hotel for those who wants to go as a tourist. ; )"
27,157,"Nov 27 2008 	Cheap room - met my expectations	I've read a handful of reviews on here and I think the angry people are kind of funny -- *what* are you expecting for under $50/nt on O'Hare? If you're expecting something as nice as a Holiday Inn Express, etc., you're fooling yourself. Think about it.This place is *fine*. The sheets &amp; towels were clean, the bed was very comfortable, the carpets were clean, the room had coffee service, an ironing board/iron, a stocked fridge ($) and an empty one. The bathroom was clean and the air conditioning/heating unit worked. I felt safe, and I felt my car was safe outside. For fifty bucks, that's all I both want and expect.Yes - the shower will fluctuate while you're showering - be ready for that. And yes, the walls/furniture are worn. But the room itself is functional - so it's just fine. You can tell that the owners are trying to make a shabby/worn motel into something nicer. Rome wasn't built in a day, and I thought that what they've done so far has been nice, though it's clear they still have a long way to go.We were in a room near the lobby so we had a weak internet signal. It would have been nice to have full internet in the room, no doubt. Still, at least there's some type of access in the motel.Never used the restaurant or pool. Didn't use the shuttle either. We did, however, walk 10 minutes to the train. We figure that we saved a nice bit of money avoiding downtown parking by using the train, so we were pleased with that. We took the train back late - arrived at the station at midnight, and we felt safe walking back to the motel (we certainly weren't the only ones who got off at that spot and walked &quot;home&quot; - and everyone was normal-looking; no scary people).We chose this location because of its proximity to the train and to O'Hare. In terms of both, this can't be beat. Especially for the price.Don't fear this place - just don't expect anything beautiful. It's functional. If you don't plan to spend time in your room, you'll be quite satisfied."
28,157,"Nov 24 2008 	I would think twice	Stayed in the hotel for three nights while attending a training in Chicago. Only reason I booked it is because my company wanted me to go cheaply. The hotel rooms are the type that you definitely don't want to walk around without shoes on. Ceiling in the bathroom had mold on it and had spots that the texture was coming off. This is the first time in my life that I was hesistant to stay in a hotel.Their website leads you to believe that some of the rooms have WiFi and rooms have wired connectivity. But in reality WiFi is only available in the lobby, restaurant and restaurant. There was no method of connecting through wired means as the website specifically states. Hotel staff could use a personality and a few training sessions. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Even though it is cheap I do not feel it is worth it."
29,157,"Oct 20 2008 	Not recommended	Couldn't pass up the CheapTickets price for this hotel - but - yuck. It has a very odd atmosphere - as if someone is trying to spiff it up, but stopped in the middle of the project. Our room was clean enough, but not sparkling - and very shabby. Old mattress and scratchy sheets - hairdryer torn off the wall - minibar only about half-full - untrained and pretty unaccommodating stuff - lousy restaurant. &quot;Fitness center&quot; with four ancient cardio machines - no TV, no towels, no water.If you do end up staying here - very, very good Thai food across the street - also decent Chicago pizza directly opposite the hotel. Close to the train - close to the airport - reasonably quiet - and felt safe. But - yuck."
30,157,"Oct 8 2008 	Honest review--you get what you pay for!	The hotel is not in the greatest of neighborhoods in my opinion, and drinks in the bar were expensive ($5 for a beer!). They &quot;lost&quot; one of our group's room reservations (we had booked three rooms)--luckily they had brought the paperwork with the confirmation #! The only close (walking distance) dinner options are Hooters, a mom &amp; pop hot dog place across the street, or Outback Steakhouse next door. The rooms seemed clean; however, one of the rooms in our group had a nauseating stale cig smell in it. No bar of soap in any of the bathrooms--had to use the shampoo to wash hands with in our room. One of the ice machines was broken--had to walk clear across the hotel to find one that worked. Between the trains and all the traffic on the expressway next to the hotel, it was quite noisy all through the night. The restaurant in the hotel was deserted at dinnertime--didn't see any wait staff--that's why we went out to eat. Staff was pleasant at check in; however upon our return, we had to wait over an hour for our shuttle to pick us up from the airport. The person we spoke with on the phone was VERY rude, stating they had &quot;alot&quot; of people needing picked up that night--basically telling us to deal with it. The driver of the shuttle is a very nice guy--this wasn't his fault. The shuttle is a little worse for the wear, but it's sufficient for it's purpose. The rude lady we spoke with also wanted us to walk to the opposite end of the airport for pickup when actually, we just needed to walk about a block down to the shuttle bus pickup/dropoff area. No one told us this fact, so we had to figure it out ourselves after waiting outside for over an hour searching for our shuttle. Luckily one of the guards at the airport was helpful in pointing us in the right direction. Our flight didn't get in until approx 10:30 pm, and by the time we got our luggage and waited over an hour, it was about midnight before we got back to the hotel and our vehicle for the long 3 hour drive home that night. Won't be doing this again! Stressful end to an otherwise relaxing vacation. :-("
31,157,"Sep 13 2008 	Close to O'Hare	Since the O'Hare Hilton where I used to stay is now almost $400 a night I thought it best to check other places. I had a flight leaving at 5:30 a.m. so I needed a hotel that had a 24 hour shuttle near the airport. A friend mentioned a site called Parksleepfly. I didn't have a rental car but I found this site wonderful because it listed what hours the shuttles ran. It was listed at $89 but in fact it turned out to be $125 and change after all those taxes that Chicago has. This hotel once was a Holiday Inn and is only 2 stories. The outside is ordinary and the inside has been updated and was very clean. The room (smoking, which is getting harder to find) was spacious, king bed, several lamps, cable/pay movies, there was a shower/bathtub (bathtubs seen to be starting to disappear in many hotels). There was a small fridge, ironing board/iron and coffee pot etc. The bed was very comfortable, the room was clean. The room has a large picture window with drapes. the window is actually 3 windows, the narrower ones on the ends open, I checked and sure enought one wasn't locked so I locked it and made sure the lock worked since I was on the ground floor facing the parkinglot.The phone had a wake up call button which does not work and I wasn't able to make a long distance call until I went to the front desk and mentioned it to the clerk who quickly fixed that and took my wake up call time.There is a restuarant/bar combo that is open til 10:00. I had dinner and must say it was fast service, good food (french onion soup and a 10oz. N.Y. strip steak, and of course 2 glasses of pinot noir), as I remember the bill was around $42 (grats were not included).There is &quot;Hooters&quot; right next door if you're into that.Although the shuttle was showing age it ran just fine and the drivers were friendly and loaded and unloaded my baggage. The hotel does NOT have one of the convenice phones to pick up to call the shuttle so it was a good thing I had their phone number with me.Hope this help! Happy traveling!"
32,157,"Sep 8 2008 	Crabby Wife	On a positive note the staff here was pleasant. This hotel is very dirty ,smells bad and has the most uncomfortable bed I have ever tried to sleep in. There was mold in the bathroom and in the ice machine. The carpet was dirty and all the walls were scuffed up.I should have demanded a refund when I saw the room .My extremely crabby wife slept in her street clothes because she was afraid there might be bugs in the bed."
33,157,Aug 20 2008 	Dont ever try this!!!	We had been there for a night stay. The Hotel was a greatest disappointment of all those we had stayed till now. The bathroom was unclean. The shower curtains had been there for ages I guess. They were old and shrunk so that all the water from the shower can come out. The toilet flushes in a way that all the water during each flush spills out. So imagine the condition of the bathroom? Its flooded with water after a flush and shower so that it becomes a lake inside the bathroom which comes out to the room. The coffee maker does not have a plug point near it so each time u make coffee you have to carry the coffee maker near the TV stand and plug it. Thank God its a one night stay. The hotel was a totally horrible and a waste of money.
34,157,"Aug 19 2008 	Not Ready to Recommend	The Chicago O'Hare Garden Hotel offered a *really* great room rate and they aren't that far from O'Hare or the Blue Line train. We didn't need to be close to downtown or North Side, so we thought it'd be a good deal.The hotel is old and a lot of it is run down. The hall carpets are dirty. The walls in the hall are scuffed and need paint. A lot of the fixtures around the hotel are new and very modern, though. It's like we stayed there while they were in the middle of a long, slow upgrade to the property.Our room was a pleasant surprise. It looks like our room had been recently remodeled. The walls were clean and the decor looked fairly new. Our king-size bed was *very* comfortable and the pillows were nice and fluffy. The hotel's van policy is about the best I've ever experienced and their drivers are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. They'll drive you to and from the airport, to and from the L station nearby, as well as to many nearby facilities, such as the FedEx Kinkos if you need to work.There is no site-wide internet in the hotel. There's no high-speed internet in the rooms, only a very slow WiFi hub in the lobby. There's no business center and working there on the lobby while sitting on one of the sofas is pretty difficult.On checking in, the desk clerk gave us the card key to the room next to ours, which was occupied. A hotel has a basic responsibility to try and ensure that your things are somewhat safe and a mistake like this on check-in does not help me feel like this hotel takes this responsibility seriously.After we'd settled into our room, we noticed that our room smelled like a pet had relieved itself on the carpet.The shower in our room had hot and cold running water -- often at about the same time. The water temp varied greatly while we took showers going quickly from warm to cold to hot.It looks to me like the current owners of this hotel are in the process of making this a nice, little garden hotel, but for me, right now, I think this hotel has quite a bit more to go before I can recommend it, even as a budget or value hotel."
35,157,"Aug 17 2008 	Great hotel for the money!	First off, do not use booking.com to book this hotel. Didn't know it, but they are in Europe. Very hard to reach. I used Orbitz (when I found that booking.com really did not have a reservation for us when they said they did) when they had a 20% special and got the room for $60/night.First the good: Hotel staff was very friendly. The room was very clean and nice. It was in a safe neighborhood with a pizza shop across the street, along with Hooters right next door. They also have the Bistro on the first floor, but we did not eat at any of those during our stay. The bed was comfortable and the A/C worked great. Bathroom was clean and the room included a hair dryer and an iron and ironing board was stored in the closet. We got free continental breakfast for the first 2 nights (they did not tell us that it would not be for the entire stay, so you have to ask). The maids did a great job every day cleaning the rooms. There was a 15 minute walk to the blue line that took you into the city, and about a 15 minute walk to the grocery store. The shuttle from the airport was free, however, they do need to replace it. It was comical to see the jalopy coming down to pick us up amongst all the beautiful vans from other hotels. We were there on vacation so we just brushed it off and laughed about it. It took them 25 minutes to get there after we called. But there is a place to sit down in the airport, so we ate breakfast while we waited.Now the bad: Well, the van was in poor shape, but the drivers were very helpful. We stayed on the 2nd floor where it was easier to go up the flight of steps than take the elevator and walk down the hallway. The swimming pool was out of service and they didn't know if it would get fixed. The shower head was great (there were 2), but the temperature of water would flucuate. The lighting in the room was very dim even with all the lights on. They had a fridge in the room, but it was one that you purchased items from instead of allowing you to use it for snacks and such. There were no &quot;do not disturb&quot; signs so the maid came to the room daily (we are the few that don't like that service), but they did a great job cleaning. If you like ESPN, then this is the hotel for you. There are like 4 channels of ESPN, so we found it hard to find something to watch at night. USA was our choice. Free HBO too, but the movies playing stunk. But of course that was not the hotels' fault at all though.I would definitely stay there again. For the money, this was a great little hotel with the things we were looking for. Hopefully they will put some money into the pool and get it open. NOTES ON THE CITY: MUST DO: If you didn't drive, GET A CTA pass!! It was our best friend during our stay. It takes you on all the &quot;L&quot; trains, and the busses. The city is easy to get around if you have a map. But be prepared to walk and wait for traffic to cross at all the crossings. Lot's of bicyclists, pedestrians, taxis and busses. Figure about $15 per person for each meal. Take a speedboat or agricultural tour on the SeaDog (I actually purchased a buy one / get one on Ebay). Shop the Magnificent Mile. Go to the zoo in Lincoln Park for FREE. See the Chicago Cultural center for FREE. Millenium Park is FREE (concerts there too) There are many FREE things to do. Google &quot;Free Things to do in Chicago&quot;. You will be amazed.We loved the Chicago style hotdog ($4 each), but not too thrilled on the deep dish (sorry Chicago, but our pizzas are better). Plus you pay $18 for a small deep dish (feeds 2 people). Our best meal (and cheapest) came from a small Italian restaruant near Randolph Street. The meal came with bread, salad and a pasta dish all for $22. That's for 2 of us. OH YEA... CHICAGO TAXES EVERYTHING. UP TO 13.25% on clothing. OUCH!!! Have a great stay. We did!!"
36,157,"Aug 14 2008 	its perfect	i booked online with booking.com because they offered a great price, i saw that the hotel was near the airport and had a free shuttle. i got off the plane, called the hotel to see where to meet the shuttle. i literally walked maybe a block, across the street and the shuttle was there within minutes. it was short drive back to the hotel, and check in was easy. i had dinner in the hotel restaurant and was pleased. the next morning, i got my wake up call and caught the 530am shuttle back to the airport. it was all smooth sailing for me. i work in a big named hotel in hawaii, and although this place wasnt as beautiful, it was perfect for a layover in chicago. i didnt feel like the room was dirty, or did i ever feel unsafe. they were just really nice and helpful! i would stay here again."
37,157,"Jul 21 2008 	Don't Do this to yourself!	We waited at O'Hare for 90 min. for the hotel shuttle. It was very hot and the driver was cranky and mean. We got to the hotel and had to carry our luggage up about 10 stairs-the elevator doesn't go to all of the second floor. The room numbers were scribbled in pencil on the wallpaper next to the doors. Upon entering, the lampshade was full of holes and the wallpaper was peeling and discolored. The bathroom was full of black mold and the shower fixtures were falling off the wall and rusted. The pool was out of service-full of dirt and leaves. It did not look like they were fixing it. We took many pictures to document all this-we did leave. I would never recommend this place to anyone."
38,157,"Jul 18 2008 	Needs a little work but not too bad.	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. For the amount of time we spent in the room, it was a good stay. The room was clean, quiet and relatively cozy. The bed was wonderful after walking 50 miles in Chicago. The bathroom could use a little help, and when someone flushes a toilet and your in the shower, you are going to get burned. The employees were ok for the most part, and the restaurant was not wonderful....food was pricey for what is was. The free continental breakfast was not great but it was something to tied you over before going out for the day. It was a good place to stay for a few days and a nice place to lay your head after a long day of sight-seeing. I would probably stay there when we go back next year, if the price is right."
39,157,"Jun 16 2008 	nice stay but unauthorized charges	I stayed at this hotel for about a week and booked the stay at travelocity website and cheapticket site.However, I found a charge of over $100 bucks in my credit card it was charged for my last one day stay . I have already payed and booked the room on travel site.I called the hotel and the accounting agent says it was a charge for my second hotel stay. I told her it was booked on cheapticket site and paid already and later she says yeahhhhh I will refund you but for two days I saw no refund. I feel certain they will give me the refund for their unauthorized charge.Anyway, Becareful and make sure you check your credit card statement for any over charge or unauthorized charge if you stay at this hotel.They should know what they are doing and make sure before the over charge a customer.nice stay but bad expereince."
40,157,May 28 2008 	CS exam stay	My husband and I stayed here for my husband's CS exam. We booked it through exam website &amp; 2 weeks in advance. We checked out the reviews only couple of days before our exam day. We were double minded after reading the bad reviews but didn't have a choice as we will lose some money if we cancel the booking in the last minute so we took a chance.Pros:1]The hotel is only couple of blocks away from the test center 2] They have a shuttle service to drop you off at the test center and pick up (from air-port also) (we didn't use it coz we drove down to Chicago)3] Bistro(&amp; guy in bistro) is nice - they say breakfast is continental but it has regular cereal/bagles/juice/coffee4] parking5] Close to other eating joints &amp; HIP mall (average mall)Cons:1] You have to carry your own baggage to your rooms2] Internet is accessable only in the hallways/lobby - so don't leave the exam prep. on your laptop. Have a paper copy.3] Water in the shower has bursts ...suddenly hot water comes out of your shower so be careful!!4] No room service (for food and stuff) you have to order over the phone &amp; pick it up from the bistro or eat over there5] House keeping people --they start early but we left the don't disturb sign out so no knocks untill noon6] I felt like my door is being opened whenever my neighbour opened/closed his door7] Most annoying was the a/c - stopped working in middle of the night..I had to get up and decrease the temp. as it was hot day/night8] Old hotel under renovations (may be under loss too that's why short staffed)Overall our experience was OK you get what you pay for. My husband had a goodnight rest (which is good for his test). I would suggest this hotel to other exam takers but pl ask for rooms on the side where renovations are not done when you book your room (so that you can get a goodnight sleep!)
41,157,"May 19 2008	Cheap Clean Stay	First, thanks for all the reviews already posted. We just got back from a Chicago trip and we stayed here taking a chance. It is in a good location near the Cumberland metro stop which is about a 10 minute walk. 40 minute ride to downtown. They offer free parking and a free breakfast in the Bistro consisting of cereal, bagels and stuff like that. The lobby was nice and the room itself was okay. The decor did need some updating in the hallways, but the room was clean and cheap. No bugs. I would offer up this advice. First, put the do not disturb on your door. The cleaning ladies start early. I went out to run in the local neighborhood a few times at 7:30am and they were already coming our way. Second, the elevator did smell of roach spray so I imagine they have an issue with that. Overall, I would recommend because of the free parking, easy access to public transportation and cost."
42,157,"May 17 2008 	No Wake Up Call	The only problem w/the hotel is we never received our wake up call and the alarm clock didn't work. We had an early 6am flight and if we wouldn't have woken up on our own, we would have missed our flight to Mexico!"
43,157,"May 2 2008 	Not bad for the $	We booked our stay through Stay123 Travel.com. They were easy to deal with. Replied promptly to our e-mails. We stayed at this motel because of the price and shuttle service to O'Hare. Check in was pleasant. Our room was ok. Clean and fairly comfortable beds. Nothing fancy, just the bare basics which is ok with us for one night. Shuttle service on time and very friendly. Walking distance to Hooter's and only a block away from Outback. Parking seems to get tight so we just left our car in our parking spot and walked to Hooters for our dinner. We would stay here again for an early flight to O'Hare."
44,157,Apr 24 2008 	Awful	Stayed at the hotel for one night In November 2007 to avoid long flights in one day. Wanted somewhere cheap as we were arriving late evening and leaving early morning. Even that was too long in this hotel. Whilst it was cheap it was totally disgusting so much so that I checked the bed before getting into it and did not use the shower because the shower curtain had mould and the bathroom needed a complete renovation and clean. Dont be fooled by the pictures of the lobby it goes very down hill from there. We ended up arriving at the airport 4 hours before our flights the following morning just to avoid spending anymore time in this awful hotel. The staff just don't care. The hotel needs to closed down. The worst I have ever stayed in.
45,157,"Apr 1 2008 	Hotel was nice... then we found roaches.	I stayed there for one night 3/31/08 so for the price I wasnt expecting too much. The hotel lobby was very clean and big. The staff was polite. Our room was average. Was clean and had new wallpaper, but our door was (what I felt) not &quot;secure&quot; compared to other hotels Ive stayed at. You had to close the door then put your body weight into it to make sure its all the way shut. And was very scuffed up and had dirty marks on it. I was overall &quot;ok&quot; with the room.... until we came back to the hotel after 2am. I went to the bathroom to shower and when I got out the first thing I noticed was a roach on the sink. I ran to my bag to take a pic of it. Killed it, and was done with it and went to watch tv. 20 mins later I went to the bathroom to pee and I see another roach running up the wall. He too got the same fate as his friend. The only other plus was the room next to us had loud people.. (we had one of those rooms that had a door that connected to their room) and the door was about a half inch short on the bottom so we could hear every conversation and the annoying girls high pitched horse laugh. Needless to say, I didnt get to bed until 4:30am.Overall the room is ok, but the bathrooms are gross. The bathroom had peeling wallpaper and water stains. Under the sink/vanity the floor has darker spots and there was about a half inch gap between the framing base boards and the floor tiles. Judging by the grossness of the gap, I would think thats where they came from. I wouldnt stay there again. The roaches killed it for me."
46,157,"Mar 13 2008 	Hated it...	After a very long trip, I called the hotel for the shuttle - no problems there - I had all my luggage when we left the airport. I arrived at the hotel wih 2 small children - the kichen was closed - no room service after 9:00pm. The room was ok, but the door to the room was not what I would rate as secure. There was knocking by the hotel staff early in the morning - woke us up - housekeeping....when I arrived home, I realized we were 1 carry on short ...I have called several times since and it is still missing...The staff was &quot;civil&quot; at best. NEVER AGAIN at this hotel. Best part of the experience was the bartender of the Bistro - I had to walk down to the Bistro to order food because our phone would not work - only to find out the kitchen had closed - but he was nice.The free continental breakfast was nothing to write home about either...I am usually laid back about my stays, but this experience was appalling."
47,157,"Mar 6 2008 	Not So Bad	The room was clean with all the basic amenities. The water pressure in the shower was a bit lacking. The lobby area and restaurant areas are very nice. However the rest of the rooms and hallways could definitely use a fresh coat of paint, some new wall paper and carpet. Other than that it was a pretty comfortable stay."
48,157,"Jan 25 2008 	Great value hotel! No problems despite negative comments from others	We were really worried about booking a room here based on the comments made by previous guests. But we were pleasantly surprised. Don't be hestitant to stay here because the price is so low. There is no catch. We arrived at the airport, called the hotel and they picked us up in 20 minutes. They have two shuttles to the airport every hour. The hotel is a bit run down, but the staff is friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and clean, room 230. There was no mould anywhere, the water pressure was okay, and we could not hear the airplanes. When we wanted to go downtown, they dropped us off at the Cumberland subway station. It's walkable, but not when it's so cold outside! The continental breakfast that was included is full of cereals, fruits, bread and pastries. And it's open from 6-11am!"
49,157,"Jan 19 2008 	pleasent stay	After reading the reviews I was expecting worse, however the hotel gave me what I paid. The only point is that the hotel is old, but the personnel and front desk were kind, shuttle service was on time. The breakfast was simple but clear and fresh and you can also order. Room was clean, there was some problem with the ceiling of the bathroom as said but it is not dripping and was not a problem as long as you dont stare at the ceiling. the minibar was full and the prices were affordable. I faced a problem with the heater of the room (it was noisy) and my room was changed when I called for help.The hotel was in walking distance to the cumberland station of blue line and the downtown was in half an hour distance.When compared to its price I was satisfied with my stay; my score is 3,5-4 / 5"
50,157,"Jan 18 2008	sounds like it have improved when i was there	I stayed there for 2 nites, they said that they had flooding on the ground floor and were not using those rooms until they we done and they are the smoking, after reading all the posts, i said oh no what have i done. I mostly stay at best westerns when i travel. i completly checked the room before i decided to stay. I have to say it was very clean, no the carpet in the room isn't new but was fine it wasn't worn through or anything like that. Yes they have an elevator and then some steps but no big deal, they brought them to our door all you have to do is ask.. I didn't see any mold. They said it used to be a howare johnsons and they are updating. They have a blow dryer, a coffee, 2 fridges, only thing cable goes at 12 forgot to ask about that. It's close to the airport, and yes you can hear some noise but it just sounded like the heater was on nothing intolerable. They will let you stay up to one hour after check out. For the price i was really suprised like i said i was so worried, we ate at the resturant nest door. it was fine. the shuttle was on time and i needed to go to the grocery store and it wasn't on the 1/2 hour and they took us anyway, we used the blue line and got off at the wrong stop and the picked us up. On our first time being in chicago. we didn't know if you get a day pass you can use it on the bus and the blue line, The only reason i wouldn't use the hotel again is i didn't realize it was so far from down town, cab was 32 dollars until we learned about the blue line it's cheap but kind of a long ride, then you get off at your stop and take the bus the to downtown just a few blocks. So we learned that next time to stay closer and buy the bus passes you can get a 24 hour or more time. Oh and we didn't get scalded in the shower. So again the only reason i wouldn't stay is because it was to far from downlown, As for the Airport it would be perfect. So all in all we had a nice stay"
51,157,"Jan 4 2008 	Worst experience	This is the worst experience we've ever experienced. The 1st night we stayed my husband realized there was mold all over the cieling and also the edges of the shower. While showering the water went from scolding hot to ice cold. I couldn't dry my hair cause the outlets wouldn't work properly. Then we asked to be moved to another room they did, but the problems remained and eventually got worse, the entrance light went out. There was still mold on the cieling but not as bad. The night before we checked out there was loud guest next door when I went to use the phone it didn't work. I had to use my cell phn, then I heard a mouse but didn't see it. While we were getting dressed the mouse had made it's way from the room next door into ours. My husband saw it while I was getting my 2 small children dressed!"
52,157,"Nov 26 2007	Worst Hotel Ever - Do Not Stay Here!	I would never recommend this hotel. It is by far one of the lowest quality hotels I have ever stayed, even with the lower rate. One night at this hotel was one night too many."
53,157,"Nov 26 2007 	Not what expected	Wish I had a camera. Would I stay again - perhaps if I got a really, really low rate.IF you go please check the bathroom ceiling, if it is flaking some may drop on you when you shower.Internet is free - but must ask for password at front desk &amp; can't log in using firefox.Will probably need to go up &amp; down stairs to get to room ,don't expect to use luggage cart entire way to room.You can request the real fridge &amp; microwave if they aren't in your room, but don't hold your breath. Every room does have the mini bar fridge already there.Take earplugs for the traffic, train &amp; plane noise.I would avoid the breakfast.. only word to describe was eeeewwww!The gym was not convenient to get to &amp; has limited hours &amp; take your own towels.Bed was comfy. Was fun to watch bunnies in the courtyard. Cable was good. Staff was quick to give second room when requested."
54,157,"Nov 5 2007 	surprizingly pleased	It is a pleasure to mention that the staff at the front desk handles problems very professionally. On the day of my departure I missed my flight due to a small mistake, and with the help of the manager, Susie Wyers, my problem was solved and compensated for. For the rest of my stay the service was excellent and the people were very friendly."
55,157,"Oct 22 2007 	Danger Will Robinson!!!!	I arrived at the hotel, and I thought it matched the description from the hotels.com website and their photos as well. As I am walking down the corridor to my assigned room, there was a large amount of disrepair evident. The room was acceptable, for a Motel6! The room I got was NOT the room shown in the photos (okay, maybe it was ten years ago)The next morning, after a night of bad sleep caused by some sort of ruckus in the parking lot, I got to take a shower, but THERE WAS NO HOT WATER!!!! After running the tap for about ten minutes, the temp reached tepid... not even lukewarm.I get dressed and go to the front desk to complain. I am told the &quot;storm knocked out&quot; the hot water but it should be coming up soon. Well, my flight was soon so I check out. I asked about a partial refund, but they were not about to even offer me a free breakfast in their bar/restaurant. I had been told the airport shuttle ran every half hour (at 00 &amp; 30 ) and I notice one leaving while I am talking to them. I asked if it was leaving early at 7:22. They replied it was actually running &quot;10 to 15 minutes late&quot; - looked more like 22 minutes to me! There was another van, but no driver. I finally made it to the airport (a 10 minute drive) and thru security with about 15 minutes before they boarded my flight. This hotel is terrible, STAY AT AT ALL COST!!!"
