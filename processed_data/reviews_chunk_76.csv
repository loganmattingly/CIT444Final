57,1862,"Jan 18 2009 	Disappointing stay	Having stayed at Essex house in Feb 08, we had no complaints and as members of Jumeirah loyalty card Sirius, we decided to book another stay for our NYC trip in December. However, this time we were very disappointed with the level of service during our stay. We arrived for check in at 6pm after a long journey only to be told our room wasn't ready. At 6PM!! No-one at check in wished us a 'welcome back', which we have come to expect from a Jumeirah hotel. We were given vouchers to order a house cocktail while we waited for our room but no apology or indication of how long our wait might be. When we were told, 10 minutes later, (before anyone had come to order our drink) that our room was ready, we went up only to find 3 staff members in the room scrubbing the carpet, and apologising that they were just &quot;getting a stain out&quot;. Delightful. The mini bar had not been restocked and we were charged for the water that was half drunk inside the fridge despite being told it would not be put on our bill.Turn down service was offered the first night of our stay but mysterioiusly not for the other 4 nights we were there. Breakfast at the Southgate restaurant was a farce; up to 20 minutes wait time in a queue right by the lifts, causing lots of irritated people (both in the queue and people trying to get in and out of the lifts) No apology was ever made by the front of house ladies while we waited, they seemed about the least bothered American restaurant staff I have ever met. The management of the restaurant seemed to be disorganised bordering on chaotic, every morning we would stare at half a restaurant full of empty tables that needed clearing while we queued to eat. When they were cleared they were not restocked properly and we constantly had to ask for butter, jam, milk etc. The wait staff, although well meaning, were badly trained and inefficient. One morning once we finally did sit down we waited 10 minutes to be served juice and coffee and I ended up helping myself to juice and serving the 3 tables around me as well. Each morning our simple order of 1 espresso and a decaf coffee plus 2 toasted English muffins proved too much to handle and we didn't get the right order on first time of asking even once. Two shining lights of our stay were the Concierges - Cullen &amp; a lady whose name I can't remember - both were excellent, polite and accommodated our requests with speed and efficiency. Aside from these two front of house staff, the rest appeared to be merely looking for extra handouts for doing nothing or providing what I would consider a basic service in a 4-5 star hotel. I have no problem tipping people who go the extra mile, but the bellman having me lift my own suitcase onto the trolley, giving me a ticket for storage and waiting for a tip? I don't think so. That was the general feeling I got from many of the staff - everyone wanting more money. How terribly un-5 star. Of course I put all this in a feedback form (the check out staff are not interested in the response to 'how was your stay' and merely tell you to respond to an email) but have had no contact from the management...I'm not suprised but I am disappointed. I'm unlikely to be going back to Essex House - there are plenty of other hotels in the same price range in great locations around Manhattan and in my opinion Jumeirah needs to do a serious review of their management to get service back up to scratch."
58,1862,"Dec 19 2008	Decent Location but........	This hotel has supposedly been recently renovated, but other than a flat screen TV and a motion activated lighting system that turned itself on and off randomly, there was little evidence of this. Our carpets were heavily stained. The bathroom has no vent/fan and steams up; there is an ever present mildew odor. The shower was useless and the plumbing has clearly not been touched in decades - in fact we were told at the gym that we should use the showers there as they were the best in the buidling. The door staff did not offer to help us carry our bags in. We waited for 20 minutes after calling to have our bags picked up as we were leaving and no one came. However, the beds were very comfortable."
59,1862,"Dec 11 2008 	very nice	we really enjoyed our short stay. room was beautiful and shower very nice. room was very large for new york standards. bell men very helpful and nice. had drinks and finger food in the little restaurant overlooking central park on main floor. the sausage sandwich was excellent with the best chips I have ever tasted. breakfast was also very nice, but the food and drinks are pretty expensive. (the south gate restaurant was worth the money, the food was really delicious) nice atmosphere, I would stay again. the lady who helped us at the front desk was also very patient and nice."
60,1862,"Dec 2 2008 	Great location and nice hotel	Stayed at the Essex House between 27 Nov - 1 Dec. This was a special treat for my boyfriends 30th. After a very swift and easy transit by cab from JFK we were checked straight in and told we had been upgraded from a Queen to a King room on the 9th floor. The room was impressive, very clean, modern and a decent size. The bed was amazing, very comfy and the bathroom was spotless with premium toiletries. Lots of fluffy white towels and high quality bathrobes and slippers. The room was great, we were impressed. We didn't use any of the hotel facilities but they seemed pricey. The breakfast was being charged at $40 which we personally couldn't justify when there are so many great diners close by (we liked 9th Avenue - good mix of bars and diners). Very impressed with housekeeping. Downturn every evening and towels and toiletries were replaced. Housekeeping would also deliver ice if you needed it and they delivered with a smile. My only experience of the conciergie was a little slow and there was a confusion over a birthday cake not being ordered but they did deliver a champagne bucket to our room as requested with chocolate covered strawberries which was a nice touch and complimentary. Great location and very handy for 5th Avenue, Times Square and Broadway etc and I would stay there again for sure."
61,1862,"Dec 1 2008 	Should be great......but the empolyee came into the room in the moring!!!	Actually, I just lived 6ix blocks from Jumeirah Essex House. . I got the room(Central Park Queen) from hotels.com, so my girl friend and I went to spend a night there on Thanksgiving(11/27) , and if it is good, then I will let my family to stay there when X'mas visiting. At first, I have to say that it is a great hotel from the location and the renovation. The first impression is really great! Everything is new and very clean.  But when I check in, they gave me the third floor room (room 309)..even I tried to change the room to higher floor, but they said no room available. So, ok, we took it...so what is view from my luxury Central Park room? Yeah, the tree top of Central Park, and the temporary construction canopy from pedestrian walk....The view is kind of making me disappoint...but my girlfriend tried calm me down... OK..this was first part. Then, the second part is the next ridiculous morning!! Next morning, around 9:30, when we was sleeping with our underwear, there was a black guy with employee's uniform came into our room..it was really scared us. He just gave us one bell ring then just open the door come in..We event still were on the bed without any consciousness. It is very unprofessional for a four or five stars rating hotel to have this kind of problem. And this time, it was the turn for my girl friend getting crazy, and I tried to calm her down.  When we checked out, of course, we told them what happened in the morning., but they looks like not a big problem..We were really upset...This is really a good hotel from the location and interior of building, but for the service...it is kind of horrible..maybe we are just unlucky!."
62,1862,"Nov 26 2008	The Essex House is Excellent!	I recently stayed here a couple of Saturdays ago in room 1130. I highly suggest anyone to request this room number as this King layout was quite large and when we were looking at another room of the same type this one was much larger than the &quot;equivalent&quot;Our experience from start to finish blew me away. I usually find fault in hotels and this hotel was absolutely perfect. The beds were beyond comfortable and the technology from the large plasmas to the LCD Touchscreen telephones kept me in awe. The rooms were very quiet if you had an interior view which can be quite valuable to anyone wishing to sleep at some point while in New York City. Everything in the room was of the highest quality. I have stayed at the St Regis and The Peninsula but due to the view(central park) and certain technological advancements I must say Jumeirah Essex House tops my list. For example, the robes were the plushest I have ever honestly seen in a bathroom along with the quality slippers with actual heavy duty rubber soles.The concierge was very helpful as well. My only complaint about this hotel was they do not have enough operators for the telephjones. Sometimes I'd wait for five minutes when I pressed &quot;0&quot;."
63,1862,"Nov 21 2008 	Better off staying in a Tent.	If you are impressed by touch screen telephones, HD TV and movement sensitive lighting this hotel could be for you.However, if you expect any sort of service such as housekeeping (takes an hour), room service (too busy to take orders) or the concierge (maybe I needed to make an appointment, because they could only speak to me in one word answers) you are better off staying at a different hotel, hostel or tent. The service at this hotel is so poor that it is nonexistent. Your tired, you get off a plane, get to your luxury hotel ready to relax. Instead you stand in line, with a scrum of people in front of you, for at least 20 minutes to check in. At the Essex house you need patience as you have this delay at check-in, check out and every time your key stops working.For Room service you wait, and wait, and wait and then get put on hold. Perhaps take you own food supply. It is certainly much quicker to walk to a restaurant. I needed directions to get to a meeting. The only way I could this done was to go the un-manned business (then return to my room to get my credit card) and pay U$22. No way could they bring this to my room and in retrospect I probably couldn't have afforded this. The central park position was great but my room looked out over a parking lot.The rooms are a masterpiece of technology. The movement sensitive lights go on and off without explanation. Also beware of the hardwood surround on the divan. If you need the loo at night and cant get the lights to work you can really hurt your shins. Trust me I have the bruises !The breakfast at the hotel maybe good, I dont know. But It was nice of them to bill me for it even though it didnt go near restaurant or manage to get an order through to room service.If you want to know what it feels like to be mugged near cenrtral park, stay at the Essex house !At U$450 / night you can find better (at U$100 you could probably find better)."
64,1862,"Nov 18 2008 	too much ton pay too little to get	i am visitting from london,u.k i have stayed from the 1st of nov till the the 14th of nov ,the room was big but dirty the sheets were not changed daily i had to ask to be changed, bathroom very dirty never clean toilets, the only thing they were doing is fixing the bed twice a day the bathtabe old daffintly i would not recommand it, for the price i paied and the length of stay i should get the best but unfortunatly i did not get and i am not a person that is fussy ,receptionist were nice and helpfull, breakfast expensive and bad, if you ask for room service they bring food cold.never to stay again"
65,1862,"Nov 13 2008 	Grat Hotel. Food could be better	Excellent accomodations, really good attention at front desk and concierge very useful. On another hand breakfast could be better and cafeteria floor could get cleaned better before you ask customers to sit down. We went with our two children (8 and 9) and stayed in a very nice two bedroom suite. Valets are kind of rough with cars. Watch out fror scratches.."
66,1862,"Nov 11 2008 	Pass on the Essex House	We booked the Essex House through the American Express Platinum &quot;Fine Hotels and Resorts&quot; program. While the room was adequate, the bathroom was not, and nothing rose to the level of a &quot;fine&quot; hotel.The room was small but clean, and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom, however, was a disaster. The cups were dirty. The sink did not drain (was full of water with one face-washing). The bathtub looked old and decrepit, having apparently been reglazed, and had mildew in the corner. When I went to switch the water flow from the bathtub spout to the shower, the lever fell off into the tub. I reinserted it and got the shower to work and noticed that the shower head was rusted. The shower curtain was barely long enough to prevent water from pouring onto the bathroom floor, if you touched it during the shower, the water leaked. All in all, not what I would expect from any hotel, not to mention a supposed &quot;fine hotel and resort.&quot;"
67,1862,"Oct 27 2008 	5 star-Great Location	What a great hotel in an amazing location. If you are visiting NYC for the 1st time or the hundreth time this hotel is prime. It is 5 star quality at and affordable rate. Across the street from central park and 2 blocks from Columbus Circle- Great shopping there! 5th ave is 2 blocks in the other direction. You really get the feel of NYC with the horse carriages clicking down the street and the view of Central park. The rooms are small but clean, modern and great linens on the bed. The staff is friendly but you definitley get the feel you are in a posh hotel. I go to NY often for shopping or just to get away and on this trip I had a great time due in part to this hotels location and comfort. I would stay here again if I get the chance."
68,1862,"Oct 26 2008	Cannot make my mind up about that one	I love New York and have stayed many times on Central Park South. So this time it was time to try the &quot;new&quot; Essex House.Swift check in, nice upgrade...but that is it! No indication when shown to my room where I can find what in the hotel, some room facilities were broken, like the light in my room entrance and during the whole week of my stay - nothing was fixed. Food was below average too.So ... lovely for a run in the park and when you are lucky the hotel driver will drop you off at your first meeting point of the day. Besides that, not much to rave about! What a shame."
69,1862,"Oct 24 2008 	Great hotel excellent service would stay again	I booked this hotel direct and found the reservations to be very helpful. The hotel is very expensive to stay at and if you are not from the US, you always have tax on top and then remember what ever you do, there are the tips to add. This was a special occasion for me, but well worth the money my wife and I spent staying there.The entrance is not large and overwhelming, it is discreet, there are more than enough staff on hand to assist you, if you are kept waiting they apologised straight away. We were taken to our room and shown around. We had a Manhattan king, which was been redecorated, it wasnt big and a bit tight and the bathroom small but it was very clean and every thing worked. The view was disappointing especially because they sell this in the description on their website, but then again what view in NY is good from a hotel room!If you have access to email, they had a nice touch of sending you an email address from the manager welcoming you and asked if there was anything they can help with to let them now. I responded and said that service was great and I was very happy although disappointed with the view because I look over a building site. Two days later I received a call offering a change of room. I didnt respond but they persisted in trying to contact me so I thought I would just be polite and take them up on their offer. We moved up to the 27th floor and were moved in to a Suite which was amazing! Please do not thing this is why I rate this as 5 stars, because the room upgrade was very nice, but the stars are earned through service, cleanliness and facilities.We used the gym, not big, but big enough, fresh towels, bottled water on hand, everything you need. Very nice showers and a nice changing area in the spa which you can use if you need to freshen up when you leave.A little tip, the hotel has two Merc's that will transport you FOC 10 blocks. They do get taken quite quickly so you may have to wait 5 - 10 minutes and its good to tip them a few dollars so it will cost you a bit like a cab, but you arrive in style!All in all, I would spend the money again and go back."
70,1862,"Oct 5 2008	Ultra-luxurious	I was part of a small group that stayed here for an art tour. The location couldn't be more perfect and the hotel has wonderful art deco ambiance. Nothing is cheap - from internet, bar, phone, to breakfast so be prepared. My room was large on the 10th floor. Sadly no park view. The flat screen TV had channels for either a park or city view which was especially gorgeous at night with the city lights. The hotel has roof cameras!I liked the decor but found it a little much - lots of gold, black and burnt orange. Not really as elegant as the true Deco style, but very nice nonetheless.The maid seemed to forget something everyday (just a minor annoyance), and I had a minibar charge (never used) when I checked out.Otherwise a great place to live it up."
71,1862,"Sep 30 2008	Mixed Feelings	The location is excellent. Property is very nice since the refurb. Decor is contemporary and nicely done in my opinion. Staff is hit-and miss. Some were very good, others were not ready for the big leagues. We had a nice suite overlooking Central Park on 24th floor...amazing view. Bed very comfy. Bathroom is nothing special. Several problem on check-in, including missing bags for 4 hours. Several other glitches required visits to front desk to rectify. Management seems to take guests for granted.Service overall a definite notch below Ritz-Carlton or Four Seasons standards. If you get a good rate and don't expect world-class service it might be a good fit. The place IS lovely and location is brilliant. Too bad the staff doesn't deliver on the place's potential."
72,1862,"Sep 26 2008 	Excellent	Staff - very friendly and helpfulRoom - Very clean, tidy, classy and generally very nice.Location - Just far enough to be able to relax but close enough to walk straight into town.All in all, my wife and I loved this place. If you're looking for a hotel which boasts sheer class, this is deffinately the right place for you."
73,1862,"Sep 23 2008	Great location not a great value	The hotel is very conveniently located with easy walking distance to the theater district, Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, the Museum of Modern Art and lots of restaurants. And, of course, it faces the south end of Central Park. I have stayed there twice, once before the renovation, and now after. Neither time did I feel that I was staying at a really classy hotel worth five hundred dollars a night. New York City is very expensive, but to get a decent view of the park one would have to pay even more than $500, and there are lesser priced hotels (e.g., Hilton) nearby with similar convenience in location. Also, despite the renovation, the bathroom remains small with a shower reminiscent of my college apartment. A few small points that were a little annoying- a conspicuous lipstick stain on a pillow, a nonfunctional telescope in my room that simply took up space- seemed to underscore that this place is just not up to the attentive detail of a really good hotel.The staff were friendly and pleasant."
74,1862,Sep 18 2008	Great for Central Park	This was my first stay at the recently renovated Jumeirah Essex House. My room did not have a full park view but I was on a high floor and could just catch a view of the park from the corner of the room. The room was not large but adequate for New York and was modern and recently renovated.The fittings were modern and fucntional and interior styling was similar to the Jumeriah Carlton Towers in London. The great thing about this hotel is that it feels like a small boutique hotel despite its size. The breakfast was excellent and the hotel bar was also good.The Essex House is a building of historical interest and the hotel lobby has some great photos of New York thoughout its history and are well worth a few minutes to appreciate.The hotel has an excellent location facing Central Park and loans out free bicycles on a first come first serve basis which proved great for a sunday morning ride around central park.A great choice when in New York.
75,1862,"Sep 17 2008 	Modern Grandeur	Stayed for one night at the Essex House after my stay at the Marriot could not be extended and what a relief! I paid less than I had per night at the Marriott (198 in comparison with 245)and the hotel was of another class entirely. The reception hall was very grand, and my 5th floor room was beautiful - extremely modern with a lovely clean bathroom. Unfortunately I did not read of all the services included until checking out, and was most dismayed! The hotel has a free bike rental service, so as one can cycle round Central Park, a complimentary limo service within 10 blocks of the hotel - excellent for Madison Avenue shop and drops. My only gripe was the cost of breakfast -$37 not including service charges! The food was brilliant but at this price I made sure to sneak some out for lunch, which was no mean feat with the amount of attentive staff on duty!"
76,1862,"Sep 16 2008 	Great hotel right across from Central Park	Stayed at this hotel with my brother and a friend for two days in September. Although the weather was unseasonably hot and humid, the hotel couldn't have been better. Great service (great advice from Luis the doorman on the Yankees game).We had a two bed room that did not have a view, but had just about everything else that we needed. Comfy beds, spacious room and bathroom. Walking distance to most everything and right off the subway line.If there was 1 complaint, it was the AC didn't cool things off as well as we would have liked.I would recommend to anyone staying in NYC."
77,1862,"Sep 7 2008 	Perched on the Park	4 night stay was marvellous. Fantastic room. Clean, very comfortable and modern. Service was good and staff were understanding of our minibar incompetence! Great hotel and bar, although expensive. Would stay again. Enjoy."
78,1862,"Sep 2 2008 	essex house - perfect location	We stayed at the Essex House on Central Park for nights, it was a perfect location to tour New York. The hotel was wonderful, our room comfortable elegance and relaxing after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. We ate at Sarabeth's for breakfast just a few doors down to he right - awesome egg's benedict!! We also ate at the hotel's restaurant the food was ok but overpriced for the entree. Very good food at the Rockerfellar center (restaurant on the skating rink), the prime rib was excellent. Skip the Guggenheim but definately see the Natural Museum of Art and the Met Museum. Skip the carriage ride in the park and borrow the bikes from the hotel for a ride around central park. The Metro cafe had great sandwiches and dessert. We saw the Phantom of the Opera and loved it!! Don''t miss Times Square! Also the harbour cruise is worth the cost. My husband says the 9-11 museum is a must see. Have fun and enjoy the Jumeriah Essex house...it is lovely."
79,1862,"Sep 1 2008 	Very good indeed	It is a very good hotel in a excellent location.The rooms are very nice and bigger than usual with all the things you need. Big TV...Concierge was excellent, even better than that. We had him reserve a couple of tickets and restaurants with transportation and every single one was done efficiently, which is more than You could say about othe hotels.We liked it, and it was good value since it was considerably chepaer than the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton.Will stay at the Mandarin or Peninsula next time though, as they seem just one step above."
80,1862,"Aug 30 2008 	I got a deal here	I put my father up at the Essex house when he came to visit. I booked about a month ahead and got a &quot;Junior Suite&quot; for about $400 a night on Hotels.com (They bulk buy bulk, we were told). The room was not a traditional suite with two rooms but it was most certainly as comfortable as any suite I have had.The service was truly impressive, world class hotel service for a room that was such a bargain. It made a huge difference in his stay, as he has some special needs that were handled with out a hitch.Other things are not a bargain, room service was quite good (and recommended) but expensive, and the hotel restaurant was OK but there are much better places in the neighborhood. My father has limited mobility so when he did not feel like going out the hotel restaurant was fine. But expect to pay about $150 to $200 per person for a dinner that can be had for half the price elsewhere.The area is very touristy, I prefer places away from the Central Park South to Times Square area, but this was such a deal and he wanted to be on CPS, for personal reasons.Finally, if the smell of horse manure is not something you want as part of your NYC experience, CPS is not the place to stay, nor dine al fresco. (Note: There is no smell of it in the hotel). However, if being across the street from Central Park is something you want (Like Jackie O, and other very rich new yorkers do) you get that here."
81,1862,"Aug 29 2008	Very comfortable hotel centrally located for all the sights of Manhatton.	Stayed for a long weekend at the Essex house hotel central park south. Very professional and welcoming staff. Handed chilled towels at check in to freshen up. Initially on 3rd floor but moved to 18th floor which had a spectacular view over central park. Room although small was adequate for two. Bed very comfortable and made up daily and turned down nightly. Lighting system operated by the touch pad on the telephone which was easy to fathom out. Floor lighting briliant idea when getting up in the dark and not such a problem as some are suggesting. Bathroom restocked twice a day with fresh towels and toiletries.Good facilities in the hotel. House keeping prompt and nothing too much trouble. Good security which was a bonus and the security staff presented in suits looked highly professional, cheerful and well mannered.Doorman remembered each guest and greeted with a nice welcome smile and cheerful banter.On day of check out our luggage was securely stored for our later departure and we were able to freshen up prior to leaving for the airport. A very comfortable relaxing stay and highly recommended for high quality and excellent service. Would definitely stay here again."
82,1862,"Aug 26 2008 	Very Disappointed	I read the reviews about this place but didn't really take them too seriously as I have stopped at this chain in both Dubai &amp; London where I found the service second to none. However not so the case in New York. On arrival we were passed wet towels in a rather flippant manner, clearly as an after thought and just before we were heading to our room, which defeats their purpose. This seemed to symbolize our experience overall, lots of gestures which tick boxes but are without effect. The Essex suite was lovely and very comfortable however never cleaned properly. Items such as the hairdryer and iron stayed where I left them and were never put away. I spilt juice which remained there for 2 days until I asked for it to be wiped clean. The turn-down service were unable to close both blinds for 4 days in a row, Ice was available but no complimentary water to go with it, Toiletries were not replenished and it goes on.I finally complained and again surface gestures were made for that day and then lack of service as usual. This is not what I expect from a 4/5 * hotel. A similar disappointment was the spa area the changing rooms had 6 lockers and only 2 showers.This hotel is all gloss and front with very little substance.I certainly did not feel that I was in a good hotel. In future I will take on board the reviews I read here as I have learnt the hard way."
83,1862,"Aug 24 2008 	Great Stay	We stayed at the Essex House for 5 nights during August. Got a good rate direct with their site a few months before staying . We registered for a reduced rate upgrade if available and were allocated a 6th floor Essex Suite on arrival. It was massive, A huge sitting room , Large bedroom ( larger than most hotel rooms), a good size bathroom and a walk in wardrobe. We were very close to the generator outside but it didnt disturb us we slept very well every night. The bed was a bit soft for my liking but was still very comfortable. There were 2 large flatscreen Tv's but we were too busy to use them. Alot of posters have mentioned the lighting. We had no problems with it except for the lights at floor level each side of the bed. All we did was put the spare pillows in front of them at night and no problem.We also enjoyed the hotel's bar, which although pricey, is a great place for a drink and seems to be getting very popular.Would recommend staying here."
84,1862,"Aug 17 2008 	A memorable stay	For our second trip to NYC we have chosen the Jumeirah given its unique blend of a historical building with a recent major renovation and its extraordinary view on the Central Park. We booked two special offers on the hotel website: the week-end package as well as the NY Waterfalls package. We arrived at 4:30 PM. Our room was not ready yet and the reception proposed another room or to come back after 6 PM to make sure our room will be ready. Given the proximity of the Central Park, we chose the second option and took advantage of making our first shoots at Central Park. Upon our return, we had the nice surprise to be upgraded to a suite on the 32nd floor. We found the Reception highly efficient with immediate attention given by four staff members of different origin to cater for the hotel's diverse customer profile.We had dinner at the recently opened hotel restaurant South Gate which looks cool and trendy. We appreciated the food, less the wines by glass, even so their $ 14 ++ entry price would let you expect some highlights. The Sauvignon first ordered had a strange and unpleasant taste, the Chardonnay suggested by the waitress as a replacement was acceptable.The suite was spacious with 4 windows allowing different photographic angles. The living was comfortable with a wall flat screen and office / make-up space and two windows. You will find one picture of the living with no backlit adjustment as to allow to appreciate the view on the Central park from inside the living.A nice king size bedroom had two other windows: one full Central Park view even from the bed and a view on the SE corner.The primary bathroom had a spacious shower cabin and a bathtub. There was a secondary bathroom we did not use.In general, the suite was immaculate and we really enjoyed our stay. The only downside was that there were a number of minibar charges without our opening the minibar and despite the fact that we immediately advised customer relations of this recurring phenomenon. Another highlight was the lounge with a highly design breakfast buffet area, a brilliant complement to the very classic hall fitted with old phone sets and outstanding B&amp;W photography. Continental breakfast was included in our packages, but we found it very limited and decided on the $ 15 ++ upgrade to full American breakfast as to taste the vast variety of items on offer.The location of the Essex House is absolutely top: it is situated in the middle of Park Avenue South from where you find yourself immediately in the heart of the Central Park, the museum mile, the high end shopping, the Fifth Avenue, the Rockefeller Center, the Lincoln Center and Times Square. Overall, it was a memorable stay and we would recommend this hotel to any one that values its unique blend of features."
85,1862,"Aug 16 2008 	Great location but remarkable for excelling at nothing else	We booked a &quot;high&quot; floor room &amp; were placed on the 5th floor which gives a view of nothing but tree-tops. High in New York means over the 10th floor to me. It is a fairly reasonable hotel for a major city, so what should one expect ? Nothing very bad, but nothing very nice was my feeling.A comfortable big bed, dated bathroom with crude plumbing, a large TV screen with modest picture quality, crude air-conditioning, hideous decoration, maddening lights which are not easily controlled, unreliable wi-fi etc.... Plus my worst, worst, worst feature in a hotel room - masses of small light sources all night - the phones, the light switches, permanent lights in the bathroom, loosely fitting window blinds and an inch of clear space under the door to the corridor. Oh dear....Nice doormen and desk staff downstairs."
86,1862,"Aug 4 2008 	outstanding	Cannot fault anything about this hotel. Perfect location opposite central park. Walking distance to the theatre and 5th ave. We were upgraded to a larger room without even asking. Towels changed twice a day. Huge flat screen TV on wall (had no time to watch). Large bathroom. Took a couple hours to figure out the lighting system in the room. If you choose it can all be done on a screen on the telephone. Just press once on the wall...simplest.Whatever you do please don't eat at Lindy's cheesecake. $10 for a small slice of aweful cheesecake and $5 for 1 cup of cold tea !! Lot's of small eateries in the same area with $5 delicious cheesecakes. Lot's of nice breakfast places in the area as well.Actually lot's of everything..it is NY after all. Great restaurants away from the crowds on the upper west side (all walking distance), on Columbus Av. Would definitely return."
87,1862,"Jul 21 2008 	not so great stay	We booked a junior suite with a connecting double bed room. Room connected only through an outside hallway door and not directly. With one child sleeping in the other room and my husband leaving early for business, it wasn't safe to leave her there so four of us slept in one room. Double bed room had a complete view of pipes. Location is great for Central Park and we walked daily to Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue shops. The service is great, but I didn't like their lobby setting in which there's no where to just relax. For breakfast we were supposed to receive breakfast vouchers for everyday for all of us due to our Silver Sirius card holder status. But the vouchers were for continental breakfast and a hot breakfast was $15 more/person. Sometimes the server would charge us for 2 people only since the other 3 where children and other times for 5 people. And every time we brought the vouchers they had to go ask someone because they hadn't seen them before. A real hassle. There's no coffee making facilities in the room and we had a tough time finding glasses to drink water from. It was never hard to get a taxi anywhere because the doormen were very efficient. Always greeted with a smile everywhere you go. Sofa bed in junior suite was not comfortable because of the springs and we ended up putting in on the floor. I guess for almost $1000/night it just wasn't worth all the problems. Their price is reasonable for Manhattan, however, and if you have the money to spend on room service and extras, then stay here."
88,1862,"Jul 8 2008 	Quit luxurious and attentive staff what is there more to ask!!!	Stayed in the Jumeirah Essex House for one night in my way back home. Minty towels were given upon check in, asked for a connecting rooms on high floors with late check out time which we got.The rooms were newly renovated; space wise was fine NYC standards, with marble bath. Lighting, AC setting can all be set via the telephone near the bed. The room was really an oasis of quietness, the rooms we got were a twin double and King Essex rooms. There were motion sensitive lights in the room and the bathroom which was a nice touch. We had breakfast at the hotel &quot;included in the deal&quot; the service was a true 5 star experience and the food was yummy."
89,1862,"Jul 6 2008 	Will not return to this hotel.	My partner and I stayed at this hotel after doing much research and comparison between this and similar hotels in NYC. We live on Long Island, and have stayed at several other highly rated NYC hotels, such as the Casablanca and Hilton hotels. We picked the Central Park King room based on the hotel website description stating that the Park view rooms offer &quot;dramatic views of New Yorks famed Central Park&quot; and &quot;present exquisite views of Central Park, so be sure to reserve your lavish Park View Room.&quot; As we were celebrating our anniversary, decided to spend the extra $100 for the highly esteemed &quot;Central Park View&quot;, and had requested a high floor.We arrived early 11:30 am at the hotel, and were told that our room was on the 5th floor, which was at the &quot;tree line&quot;. We asked if there were any other rooms available on a higher floor, but was told that there were not. While the room was lovely and very clean and quiet, the air conditioning did not work well, and would not go below 67 degrees. The Central Park View which we had been promised ended up being a view of some very large trees, with no park view whatsoever (see my picture included with this review). With the telescope provided in the room, we could see the leaves on the tree. Not very exciting, and definitely not worth the extra money. If I wanted to look at trees, I could have done so elsewhere for a lot less money.We contacted the manager on duty to let her know that we were disappointed with our stay, but she made no attempt to compensate us whatsoever. In fact, she tried to blame us by saying that we had booked the room on the same day. While I can understand that there may not have been any other rooms available given our last minute booking, we still should have received what we thought we were paying for, and that was, according to their website, &quot;lavish&quot; and &quot;exquisite&quot; views of Central Park. In my opinion, if they are going to have rooms with a tree obstructed view of Central Park, they should list them on their website as &quot;obstructed view rooms&quot; or the like, so that the consumer is not mislead into expecting something better than a tree view. We won't be staying here again....for what we received in terms of a room with a bad view and faulty air conditioning, it was not worth what we paid for."
90,1862,"Jul 1 2008 	Very comfortable stay at the Essex House	I ended up at the Essex House through my firm's New York hotel roulette (&quot;find me a room in Midtown,&quot; I believe I said). When I got into the cab at JFK and gave the address (&quot;59th between 6th and 7th&quot;), he said, &quot;Oh, the Essex House or the New York Athletic Club?&quot; Clearly this is a known hotel.When I arrived, the doorman opened the door of the cab and my suitcase disappeared with a bellman. As I waited on line (why is there a line at such a swank hotel?) someone approached with a cold washcloth on a plate so I could refresh myself.I had requested a hypoallergenic room as I'm allergic to feathers, and the front desk clerk sent someone to make sure it had been done (it hadn't). While I was waiting, I asked if someone could make a dinner reservation for me, and within ten seconds the concierge came over and made a reservation for me at some Italian restaurant on Seventh Avenue (good, but too expensive for the quality).I was taken upstairs to a city-view room on the 12th floor and while it was somewhat small (the armchair is oddly-placed), it was extremely comfortable. The lights came on automatically -- more on this later -- and I got ready for dinner.The toilet is odd -- it takes nearly twenty seconds between the time you push the lever to the time it actually, erm, flushes. The sink is one of those &quot;bowl sitting on the counter&quot; types, but the handles are in front -- if you have a small child, they can EASILY reach this and flood your bathroom. The shower was extremely comfortable -- two shower heads, good temperature and great water pressure especially for the twelfth floor, but oddly the drain stopper had been pulled out on its rubber lead, which lent an ugly touch to the bathroom. The towels are very, very heavy and warm, which is nice -- they wick away the water very quickly -- but they're stored above the shower and so they tend to get soaked if you use the moveable shower head. The porter had seen that I am not a 98-pound weakling and so replaced the house robe and slippers with something more appropriate for a tall guy.The bed -- I laid on the bed and went &quot;aaaaaahhhhhhh, I'm never getting up, this is too nice!&quot; Very soft and comfortable. The new pillows were just fine -- foam pillows are foam pillows -- but the hypoallergenic blanket was terrible. Brown and thin and stiff and scratchy like a camping blanket. Given that it had replaced a plush down comforter, I was not terribly happy, but that is what they had. It would take so little to have a small stash of comfortable, hypoallergenic comforters.When I went out, I asked for turndown for my return. When I returned the bed had been turned down, with a mint on the pillow and a heating plate of milk on the side table with cocoa mix to mix in. Very nice!When I got into the bed, I had a problem -- how do you turn off the lights? I mean, I've worked in IT for ten years and I've never had problems turning off lights in a hotel room. It took me nearly twenty minutes -- with me refusing to give in and just call -- to figure out that some of the lights are controlled at the front door, some of the lights are controlled at the side wall next to the bed, the purple (purple??) light above the headboard is controlled by a switch in the centre of the headboard, and the other lamps have individual controls. I still don't know how the lamp controls worked, because they appeared to be touch controls, but if you spun the dial, it would either turn off, or turn down. Trying to control anything from the room control system on the phones (three phones in a 20 m^2 room) was an exercise in futility -- you could see it blinking furiously as it transmitted data, and then nothing would happen for four minutes, and then all of a sudden after you had given up, you'd be plunged into darkness. The &quot;moods&quot; were useless as well. The most irritating thing, though, is something they trumpet on their website -- stumble lights. The bedside tables and the bathroom vanity have motion sensors and if you move past them, underlighting turns on and you CAN'T TURN IT OFF. Two minutes of non-motion have to go by and then it will turn off by itself. This sounds like a great idea, but let's say you turn over and the blanket falls slightly off the bed, or your arm dangles, all of a sudden it's BRIGHT in your room. If you're not the only one in the room and you get up to go have a slash, you'll wake everyone else up. I'd be OK with stumble lights in the bathroom but make it so I can turn them off!! Go back to regular light switches, PLEASE.Same with the room temperature. I never did figure that out. There was a thermostat on the wall that showed 22 C (that's, hm, 73 F or so), which is what I wanted it to be, but the phone control said the room was set for 25 C (77 F or so) which was too warm for me. I couldn't get the fan to run except if I used BOTH. Too confusing!!One nice piece of technology was that you don't have to open your door to put the &quot;do not disturb&quot; or &quot;maid service please&quot; sign out -- it is controlled by a switch right inside the front foor which lights up a red LED outside for &quot;do not disturb&quot; and a green LED outside for &quot;maid service please&quot;. Your room also has a doorbell -- there is no knocking.The hotel has a car service for trips within a 10-block radius and they're fairly forgiving about what 10 blocks is (you will definitely want to use this if you've ever tried to hail a cab in the rain), or if the weather is fine you can use the hotel's bicycles. In addition they will lend you umbrellas. When I went to the gym on the 3rd floor to work out, a personal trainer helped me through my stretching, and explained that if I wanted (and for an additional price) I could have exercise equipment and a trainer brought to my room, or in-room yoga.Internet access is available -- both wired and 802.11g wireless -- but the wireless signal strength is not good on the fringes of the building. Access is EXTREMELY expensive -- on the order of $25 a day -- you could get a month's worth of access using your cell phone as a modem for the price of three days' Internet access.I didn't eat or drink anything in the hotel except tap water (New York has the best tap water in America, why should I pay for water?) and I had to call to request ice (it was delivered each day after that for me). I read about the $33 breakfast buffet and honestly, there's Petrossian across the street, and Le Pain Quotidien kitty-corner to that (both on 58th and Seventh Avenue), or on Sixth between 56th and 57th is an espresso bar called Zibetto that could have been torn straight out of Rome (no seats -- stand at the bar or get it to go, no soy no-foam latte half-caf nonsense, and cheaper prices than Fourbucks), or if you really want the New York experience, go to the cart on 58th and 6th and get a bacon, egg and cheese on a hard roll.In general, this was an excellent hotel and you'll be pampered -- if you can convince yourself to get out of bed. However, you will go crazy trying to control your room. Now that I've fought the battle (and won the skirmish with the stumble lights by blocking the bed table motion sensors with spare pillows), I'll be happy to return."
91,1862,"Jun 30 2008 	Loved this hotel beautiful extremely quiet classy!	I had a lovely stay here at this hotel. Easy check in, kind staff. Beautiful room as well. room was a bit small, but most are in nyc. It was nice and tastfully decorated. It was also very very quiet. Couldnt hear street sounds, couldnt hear anyone open close doors, couldnt hear anyone turn their water or showers on..nothing......dead silence ! perfect place to stay for a beautiful experience and restful nite. They also have a lovely lounge with great selections and a beautiful area to relax in the lobby."
92,1862,"Jun 24 2008 	Beautiful - great location - very nice staff	I stayed for two nights at the Essex while at a business meeting hosted there. Our rate was $379, which is very reasonable for a 4 - 5 star hotel NY midweek.The sleeping room was lovely - the bed was wonderful - I loved having King Size and regular size pillows. Great plasma tv. Very nice to have a light for Do Not Disturb - and it was respected. Little touches were so appreciated. Robes were luxurious, soap and other amenities were top notch, newspaper (choice of NY Times or Wall St Journal) delivered in a bag hung on the door each morning. Ramon the bellman was a font of information and he remembered my name as I saw him again over the next three days.Business amenities were very nice. Individually wrapped boxes of luxury mints on the meeting tables, Voss water in glass bottles, nice pens and notepads, very helpful staff in the business center.I would return here again and again - if I could pay $400 or less."
93,1862,"Jun 19 2008	Overrated	This hotel is extremely overrated. The rooms are only partially renovated. The sleeping area was nicely renovated but the bathroom was original 60's era plumbing, the shower didn't even work properly, the toilet, sink, and tub were all decades old. It is a [-] facade on an old building. The service was extremely unprofessional and incompetent. I had more problems with the administration of my stay than I have ever had at a hotel before and it took HOURS of time to resolve them. Staff was also unresponsive to requests for booking assistance before arrival. With all the hotels to choose from, I see no reason to select this one."
94,1862,"Jun 19 2008 	Enjoyed the Essex House	We just returned from three nights at the Essex House in NYC, and it was very nice. In recent trips we've stayed at the Parker Meridien, the Michaelangelo and the Soho Grand, and liked them all. At the Essex House, my husband and I stayed in a park view King on the 14th floor and our kids stayed in a two-queen bedded interior room on the 14th floor, not connecting. Both rooms had been redone nicely, although the kids' room (1425) had a nicer and larger bathroom than ours (1405). Our king room was small as compared to the Michaelangelo, but not compared to the Parker Meridien. We borrowed the hotel's four complimentary, first-come, first-served bicycles to tour Central Park. This was great, even though two of the bikes were a little small for our boys. The location of the hotel on Central Park South between 6th and 7th makes it ideal for exploring or running in the park. We found all the staff to be friendly. We enjoyed the expensive but very nice breakfast buffet ($37). We enjoyed the bar with views right onto Central Park South. Only negatives: there is quite a space under the hotel room doors so when drunken partiers come in at 3 am you get to enjoy their conversation as the pass by your door, and our kids room was right next to an elevator, which did emit some mechanical noises. This is tough for me, a light sleeper, but never bothered our kids. Final negative is that it seems as though there was more of a line at the front desk than there should have been for a property at this price point. However, I must say that our kids' room was really large for NY and with two queens and a large bathroom, a great option for people sharing a room. They had three large windows that looked out onto nothing, but which brought the light in. Apparently, the highest floor on which these two queen rooms are available is the 14th floor. There are many different types of rooms and views in the property, so you may want to call the hotel directly. I only wish that accommodations in NY were not so expensive- -these two rooms were not cheap."
95,1862,"Jun 10 2008 	Best Hotel Bed Ever!	If you are new to NYC then this hotel is in the perfect location. It is right on the south side of Central Park and you walk out the front doors and see it every day. Plus all the taxi drivers seemed to know it, no mean feat considering the number of hotels in the city.Apart from the location the only other thing that set this hotel apart, in my opinion, was the fantastic bed (and pillows). It was unlike any bed I have ever slept in. To say that I felt like I was floating on a cloud is no exaggeration! We almost asked the concierge if we could take it with us.Not that I am a fussy sleeper but usually, as many people will experience, the first night in a strange city/bed/etc. is usually not that restful. During my long, hectic w/e however, I always looked forward to falling into that wonderful cocoon every night (can't believe how tragic this sounds but it has to be said).The ensuite was a little peculiar, I'm sure the toilet seats were heated but the bf said it was my imagination. However, it was a nice touch in the cold spring weather. Only gripe was the shower seemed to have two settings: scalding hot or 3rd degree burn.The breakfast was quite dear, but a worthwhile luxury if you can afford it. Staff helpful and of course the service was with a smile.Would not hesitate to recommend it."
96,1862,"Jun 4 2008 	Great historical hotel	There are a lot of little touches at this hotel that make it specail. The bed is probably the best I have ever slept in. Way better then the Westin Dream Bed. It seemed like there was always someone cleaning my room whenever I came back to it. Nice, but almost too much. The lights are controlled by touch screen on the phone, which can be confusing. They are also motion sensored. One morning, all the lights went out in the bathroom while I was in the shower. Overall, the experience was great though. I was feeling ill when I arrived and was told that no rooms were available yet (it was about 11:30 AM). When I indicated that I did not feel well, they had a room for me within the hour. Bikes are availbe to use in Central Park. Also, there is a car service that you may use in a limited area."
97,1862,"Jun 2 2008 	Delightful stay	We have stayed at this property since the 70's and have seen it through several ownership changes. Of its many virtues, the location is extremely convenient for our visits to the city and, of course, no change in ownership changes that!We've been there several times since Jumeirah took it over, and each time the very good service gets better. Everyone on the staff was pleasant and helpful. Check-in was easy and quick and extremely welcoming. Everyone we met (including the house staff in the corriders) smiled and said hello. Nice touch.We like the cosmetic improvements to the rooms and the bed is unbelievably comfortable. As others have noted, the light switches are a mystery, but it's more of an amusing challenge than a hassle. Finally, we were about 15 minutes away from the city (on our way home by car) when we realized that we'd left a pair of sunglasses in the room. We called the hotel (this was at 6:30 am!) and by the time we drove back to the hotel, they had retrieved our glasses and held them at the front desk for us. Thanks!We wish the hotel was just a bit less expensive, but consider it our home in the city and welcome the improvements and service level."
98,1862,"May 27 2008 	Still a good bet in NYC	Generally, great location, walking distance of subways, shopping and if your healthy. the theater district! Mostly the advantages of a four/five star. Tastefully restored historic lobby, 5star restaurant/lounge, bellmen, doorman, security, etc., deposit boxes, ATM, gym, and new renovated rooms. Staff appeared to be friendly willing to satisfy and always on the move. The newly renovated rooms is where they could lose a star. The rooms are spotless so no housekeeping worries here! However, as a contractor/architectural designer the problems in my opinion can be attributed to poor construction and poor design. The entire electric system in the room is ill thought. You turn the lights on through a panel on the phone. Sometimes the light came on right away and sometimes the system has to think about it a while. Even with all the lights on in the room, half the room is dim. The track lighting focused on the window is an absolute waste. Picture this while one side of the room is in darkness you can look over and see how nicely illuminated the window treatments are!? The one outlet above the desk is the only outlet that made sense. There was an outlet in the bath (under the hanging hand towel) and one 7 high .. inside the closet! (Oh &amp; by the way the closet had two lights in it.) We tried to use the iron and board; you had to either iron in the closet or in the doorway of the bathroom. Even though there was ample vacant wall space not an outlet to be had. The bathroom. I cant say I blame the hotel for this faux pas either. Some designer and contractor lead them down the wrong path. The contemporary sink is an oversized bowl and strangely shaped allowing water to go everywhere. The faucets are awkwardly placed in the front. The toilet (probably a water saving design) appears to also have to think about it before it works. The new fiberglass tub already had a big chip in floor of the tub and where the door swings the stopper started a crack on the side. The faucet and showerheads are obviously installed incorrectly and starting to come apart from the base and look shabby. A 4 off colored square I noticed on the wallpaper was actually, upon closer examination a hole in the drywall that the wallpaper just covered right over.The best part of the room is the plasma TV, new furniture and especially the BED. It was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in away from home. Even with the design issues Id return if they had a deal going. I hate to even give them just the four stars because I felt it was obvious the hotel was trying to live up to being one of the better NYC hotels but, I just had a room with potential problems."
99,1862,"May 19 2008 	Wonderful stay at the Essex	We stayed at the Essex House for my special birthday and it was wonderful. The service was very impressive. When we checked it we were surprised by being told that we had an upgraded room. We had booked a king room with city view and were given a junior suite on the 38th floor. It was spectacular, 2 bathrooms, living room, very large bedroom. We had dinner in South Gate, very good food and again wonderful service. In the service area, this hotel does not miss a beat, they are right there to make sure that everything is perfect.. Excellent buffet breakfast was included. Not cheap but so worth the price if you wanted to be treated special."
100,1862,"May 18 2008 	Perfect New York Experience	We stayed when it was still called the Westin/Essex, but it's still the same property.Years earlier we stayed at a cheap Times Square Hotel and got a cheap experience, so this time we wanted to stay where all the places we wanted to visit were located and we extremely pleased.It was marvelous to come from the airport straight to a swank Hotel Directly on Central Park South. The lobby was beautiful.Our reservations were mixed up (three of us), and they said they could only take two. I've learned the hard way to be polite but firm and stand my ground, showing them the reservation, and they eventually upgraded us, seeing my resolve.We were delighted with the room, large, spacious, with an INCREDIBLE bed that was like sleeping on clouds. We were even more delighted when the roll-away the brought for our teen was, incredibly, ALSO a luxury bed! I've never seen a luxury roll-away before!It was nice that the elevators were guarded day and night, but the attendants immediately seemed to memorize our faces and greeted us politely each time.It was incredible to be so CLOSE to everything important in New York...Central Park, the shops of Madison Avenue, the TV studios...even Times Square was only a brisk walk (with a brisker cab ride back.) It was awesome to stroll to the NY Deli, to the breakfast shops....we felt like we were living in a Seinfield episode. If you're going to be a tourist in New York, spring for the extra to stay in a wonderful hotel like this, centrally located. We did not think of requesting for a room with a park view...or only mistake, but even then it was fun.The spa was wonderful and reasonably priced."
101,1862,"May 15 2008 	Best New York Stay Ever!!!	We reserved this hotel via American Express Centurion. However, about a week before I decided to check the website and they we're having a 50% off suite deal (it really was not 50% off but a good deal). Thus, I re-booked the rooms directly with the hotel. I made it very clear that I wanted a suite with an adjoining room - almost all hotels cannot confirm this until check in. When we arrived, our rooms were not only adjoining, but were about 10 floors apart. The lady at the front desk brought me over to the managers desk (Caroline) and she proceeded to work her magic. They actually emailed me a couple days prior telling me that the suites I had booked could not be on the same floor (so, it was my fault for not checking my email). The manager secured a suite for me with possibly the best view of Central Park of any property in New York (see attached picture). She also got us a wonderful connecting room for our friends. We were on the 37th floor; the rooms were new, beautiful, had flat screens, and the beds were very comfortable. When I woke up the first morning, there was a haze over Central Park, the wind flowed in from the cracked windows and the sun slowly peaked over the horizon - it was pure heaven - the most memorable morning I've ever had. The wife of the couple we stayed with actually txt'd me a couple days after we left and said &quot;i miss the Essex House.&quot; Well, I do to; our rooms were awesome, the service was great and the security was crazy. At night, there were three security staff guarding the elevators. I'm not sure if it was a special guest (Dave Chapelle was staying there, but he's surely no head of state), but you could not feel more safe. Also, every night we went to dinner we got free use of the Mercedes GL450. this was great, because we were a party of 8 and we could all squeeze in. On stressful days, I think we all have that special place we wish we were; for me, that place is the Essex House in that beautiful room overlooking Central Park. If you forced me to complain, the only thing I can think of is that the wireless internet connection did not work on the 37th floor. No other complaints, and, for the first time, we'll be staying at the same hotel in New York next year."
102,1862,"May 11 2008 	Could be so much better. . . . .	After a hiatus of several years, I returned to the Essex House (&quot;Jumeirah&quot;) for a weekend stay recently. I knew that it was under new ownership and that the rooms had been renovated; I was excited to see how the property had improved. I had been a regular and frequent guest through the '80s and '90s.Check-in took nearly 40 minutes, and I did NOT have to wait in line. I had requested a King Room on a high floor, with a Central Park view. All they had available for me was one on the third floor, which I refused, as we had been keenly anticipating a special weekend in New York, and I wanted the good view of the park. (When I had called that morning to reconfirm check-in time, I was told that it was &quot;guaranteed 3 o'clock check-in; we have lots of open inventory.&quot;)  I ultimately ended up in a room on the 22nd floor with outstanding views. Once I entered the room, a suite, my heart sank when I saw that the promised King was a Queen. There was not enough time to run back down to the front desk; I had to dress quickly for an event, and I just didn't want to deal again with the hassle I endured at check-in. Needless to say, the smaller bed resulted in fitful sleep for my companion and myself for both nights.Try figuring out how to work the lights, telephone and thermostat in less than twenty minutes. If you can do that, you must be a member of MENSA.Room service: coffee for one = about $12.50, plus a little extra for the tip (on top of the included service charge). No turn-down service on the first night. I had asked for an in-room coffee maker to be delivered to the room (no charge). Used coffee cup, coffee carafe, and filter with grounds in it were left behind after daytime cleaning. I took the dirty coffee cup and used filter with grounds out of the room and placed it on a prominent table in the foyer at 5pm yesterday - - - it was still there at 10am today when we checked out.Used towels and washcloths were removed and never replaced. I washed my face this morning with a corner of my towel. Hey- not really a major problem, and I know I'm nit-picking, but this was not what one would expect for the price and hype. I miss the old &quot;library&quot; bar, which used to be near the 58th street entrance, now replaced by a stuffy little restaurant with outrageous breakfast prices.All in all, I was moderately disappointed with my experience, but you can't beat the location, especially for an early morning run through Central Park, a visit to MOMA and Bergdorf's, a delighful dinner at Nino's Tuscany Restaurant, and an evening of Domingo at the Metropolitan Opera!The people who work security at the elevator banks were always gracious and friendly; the bellmen and doormen were great; a special thanks to Carlos at the front desk, who is a gem, and who made up for a lot of this property's deficits."
103,1862,"May 1 2008 	Fabulous!	My husband and I recently enjoyed a long weekend here. We found a great deal on Tra velzoo which came out to $274 a night including the excellent breakfast buffet (normally $66 plus tax and tip for two people). The location was a perfect base to explore the city. We were able to go for a run in Central Park (directly across the street) and easily walk to all midtown locations (Broadway, 5th avenue, Times Square, Lincoln Center, etc.) The room itself was very nicely appointed, boasting a large bathroom, quite comfortable bed, and virtually no noise. We highly recommend Jumeirah Essex House!"
104,1862,"Apr 26 2008 	Second time around...not coming back	I've reviewed this hotel once before on this same website, and wanted to edit my initial review from our previous stay but that's not an option. So, I'm writing a second review based on our stay in April 2008.I arrived at the hotel a few hours before my husband so I checked in and stored my luggage at the bell desk. The woman helping me check in had to ring the bell about 5 times while 5 bellhops stood around in the lobby area talking. None of them even realized that she was trying to have one of them come over to take my luggage. I stored some belongings in a safe deposit box before exiting the hotel. The safe room is so old and I could see that some of the safes appear to be missing their boxes. That was such a strange sight.When I finally checked into the room, I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and noticed that my shampoo and conditioner bottles were both missing some liquid. It was OBVIOUS that some past guest had used a small amount and then instead of throwing the bottles away, housekeeping re-sealed them and put them there for the next guest to use. Appalling. This made me wonder if there were other &quot;cut corners&quot;. I checked the sheets thorougly before climbing in!!The ceiling in the bathroom had not been re-finished and looked like it didn't belong with the rest of the decor. I have no idea how a hotel finishes it's rooms, but then fails to completely re-finish the bathrooms. yuck. (this bathroom's celiing was worse than the ceiling in the other bathroom we had 2 month's prior).I called housekeeping and asked them for new shampoo and conditioner bottles and some were brought to me right away. I also contacted housekeeping about use of a steamer (for clothing) and one was brought to the room for me to use. The hotel does not normally provide the steamer so I thought it was very nice of them to let me use theirs.I used one plug with the steamer and it shorted the lights in the room, so I had to call housecleaning to have someone re-set the electricity. That was partially my fault with the plug, however, I checked the notice on the plug (before plugging in) and the voltage seemed to be ok for how much was needed to support the steamer.The room itself was fine, and we had a nice view of 57th street because the building directly behind the hotel was completely gone. When I went to claim my belongings from the safe deposit box, the women at the front desk couldn't figure out how to open the box and it took her about 15 minutes before finally finding someone else to do it for her. The staff at this hotel from checkin, bellhops, and housecleaning do not meet anything above a 3 star hotel. That is why I am giving this review 2 stars (to average out with the 4 star rating I gave the first time)"
105,1862,"Apr 16 2008	Could be Excellent....	Everything was charming and almost faultless in the hotel apart from the technology in the room. Great shame but frankly it's a little bit of a mess. The hi-tech in-room ighting is just not intuative. Guys, you've got to do something about it and observing other reviewers, there's clearly a problem. Silly unmarked buttons and touch sensitive Nortel phones that don't work left me baffled and a little frustrated. Sorry, could do, and should do, better."
106,1862,"Apr 15 2008	Classic Essex	We had a really lovely stay at the Essex, a totally renovated heritage property bordering Central Park. The location is fabulous for a short stay in New York, close to 5th Avenue shopping, Carnegie Hall, the park (of course) and only a short cab ride to the hustle and bustle of Times Square.We had booked a Junior Suite, but we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite, which was perfect for our family of four. Our room was very large and spacious, impeccable and luxurious. Others have mentioned the difficulty in trying to operate the high tech lights and TV but the porter gave us a quick tutorial upon arrival and we had no problems. No park view - the costs go up dramatically for that category. The bathroom(s) were really big.The Essex staff were polite and professional, especially at the front desk. We chose the Essex because it seemed the best value for both a suite and location (we wanted a quieter area). It's among the Ritz Carlton, Plaza, Helmsley, etc. but was significantly more affordable, yet still 5 star quality. Our bed was amazingly comfortable and has us thinking about replacing the one we have at home! It was our first visit to New York and we stayed at the Essex based on the Tripadvisor reviews and those of friends who had recently stayed there. I would definitely recommend it."
107,1862,"Apr 11 2008 	Bad Experience at this Hotel!	Nice location, but the hotel itself sucks! The staff were extremely rude and did not provide the level of service expected of a four diamond hotel. Never staying here again."
108,1862,"Apr 9 2008	loved the Essex house	I stayed in a suite, The rooms were very spacious. The hotel also provides a car service which takes you as far as 10 blocks (which is handy when it is raining!). The room was very up to date with technology(Plasma T.V, Bose radio, touchscreen telephones, automatic lighting)although beware if you take anything out of the minibar for more than 30 secs you will be charged for it! Located outside Central Park South. Brillant trip!"
109,1862,"Apr 7 2008 	very nice not incredible for the price	This would have received an excellant rating, however, the price paid relative to amenities is not worth it. The hotel has a great location, beautiful lobby, and nice modern rooms. however, my room was a shoebox. the bathroom was nice, but the tub was old and cauking peeled away. the good features were the automatic lights when you walk to the bathroom, they turn on. very helpful for those nighttime visits. Did not eat in the restaaurant, but the bar was very modern and the staff friendly and helpful. This would have received an excellent rating if it were $300/night, but at $700, i would expect a bit more."
110,1862,"Mar 30 2008	Awesome!	Just returned from a fantastic trip to New York and stayed in a suite on the 33rd floor of the Jumeirah Essex House. We had a manhatten view, but from the lounge you could see central park and the skating rink. Despite a couple of teething problems with the room, the hotel staff were attentive and quick to sort out any problems. Breakfast was quite expensive - 33 dollars each for buffet and there wasn't a massive choice, sometimes you had to queue as there weren't many tables. There are many places out and about you can get breakfast for a fraction of the cost. Concierge were very helpful in recommending a local Italian restaurant and even booked a table for us. The hotel is ideally situated so you can walk to most things - 5th Avenue, Rockefellar, Empire State, Theatre District and Times Square. The tube is quick and cheap for longer journeys (and you don't have to tip!!) also the hop on hop off tours are a good way to see a lot in a short space of time.We ate at the hotels newly opened restaurant Southgate and the food was reasonably priced and very tasty indeed. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. p.s. the beds are soooo comfortable and our bathroom was lovely and bright and clean. (after our 1 week stay i just mastered the hi-tech lights!)If you have never been to New York before then beware of the the tax added to most things and also gratuity - some restaurants can automatically add up to 15-20%!! which is a lot!p.p.s. Pre-book as many things as you can before you go - especially statue of liberty - get reserve tickets to beat the one and a half hour queue and if you want to go inside the lower area of the statue you need to get monument tickets."
111,1862,"Mar 28 2008 	Views amazing... service not so	I chose this hotel as I wanted to spend the final night of our week long holiday in New York overlooking Central Park.When we went to check in the room was not available which was fine as we were early. They kept our bags and we spent the day out in NY.On our return at c. 6pm we were held back checking in to our room as it was not ready and we they subsequently upgraded us to a room on a higher floor.Now to the room. The room itself was lovely. Very nicely decorated, plenty of space and a lovely clean bathroom. Bed was very comfy.The faults - TV had a terrible signal and was barely watchable, not kettle even after several requests, the lighting system through the phone control panel didn't work, light above bed stayed on and couldn't be turned off, no safe in the drawer marked safe.Would I stay again? Probably not but only because the reason for staying was to get a view of Central Park and I've now done that."
112,1862,"Mar 27 2008 	Jumeirah Essex House delivers	Jumeirah Essex House isn't cheap, but it is worth the money. The hotel is elegant, rooms are spacious and the location can't beat on Central Park South between 6th and 7th Aves. You can easily walk to MoMA, theatres, restaurants, shopping on 5th Ave or Columbus Circle, etc, but can avoid the noise, crowds and congestion of the Theatre District. The spa is a nice plus if you want to splurge on any of the services. Some parts of the hotel are still under renovation (gift shop, dining room) but with so many other nearby conveniences, this isn't a problem."
113,1862,"Mar 18 2008 	Memorable Hotel	We just returned from a special stay at the Essex House. We loved everything about it -- the service was excellent, the renovations tasteful, the bed comfortable, and the view of the park from our window lovely! We will definitely try to stay here from now on. Thank you, Essex House, for making our 25th wedding anniversary so memorable!"
114,1862,"Mar 15 2008 	enjoyed our stay here	We had a spacious corner room on the 18th floor. It was extremely quiet and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel staff members were gracious and helpful, always at hand if we needed anything. The elevators are very fast - seems like a little thing, but when you are on the 18th floor it can be an issue. The decor is fresh and lovely. I would definitely stay there again. Oh - that has to be the tiniest &quot;gift shop&quot; I have ever seen! Right by the elevators so I could run down and get my coffee each morning from the nice lady there. Definitely recommend this hotel."
115,1862,"Mar 10 2008 	Great Stay	I stayed here the first week of March 2008. Haven't been here in 2 years, so first thing I notice is the renovation. Beautiful changes! I loved the automatic lighting in the rooms, the modern style of the bathroom, the orange/red color schemes. Service was great, loved the ice bucket being filled each night for me! Overall great place to stay!"
116,1862,"Feb 29 2008 	Exceptional stay at the Essex House	President's Day weekend I stayed at the Essex House and have to say it was a wonderful experience. I booked the trip through American Express Platinum travel and was very pleased with my choice. The hotel staff was very attentive and extremely polite. I thought they did a wonderful job in renovating the property. We were given a complimentary upgrade upon arrival and our room was very well done. My two complaints of the hotel are:1. They only essentially renovated half of the bathroom. I believe they left the original cast-iron bathtub and I think they should have improved that portion of the bathroom. Everything else inside was brand new and very tastefully done.2. My second complaint pertains to the lighting. While I thought it was really cool that you could control everything from the phone, our room would never get very bright when we needed the lights on. I found it exceptionally difficult to apply my makeup at night because the lighting was so dim.Aside from that I have to say my experience there was wonderful. It was raining on Sunday night and we were leaving for our dinner reservations and the bellhop handed us a very nice umbrella to take with us, while we were standing outside, even though we never asked for one. I also really appreciated how helpful the concierge was in making and surprisingly getting last minute reservations at very trendy restaurants. Lastly, even though we had late checkout, our flight was delayed and we called the front desk to see if we could push back our checkout time and they assured us that it would not be a problem and to take out time. I would definitely stay there again."
117,1862,"Feb 19 2008 	Fab hotel in a great location!	Jumeirah Essex House has a fab location overlooking Central Park. Its about 5 minutes away from 5th Avenue and from there its easy to get to everything else.We asked the hotel to arrange a pickup and when we finally come through immigration at JFK at about 1am we were pleased to have a friendly face waiting for us rather than finding a taxi. The staff on the front desk were friendly. Check-in was fuss-free and we were into our room in about 5 minutes from arriving.We had a lovely room on the 14 floor over looking Central Park. The room was average size, but clean and comfortable. Only disappointment was the lack of an oversized bath  unusual for Jumeirah. The bathroom on the whole was a little dated and not of the usual luxury standards that we have come to expect of Jumeirah. Nonetheless, the bathroom was clean and provided toiletries, lots of fluffy towels and bathrobes.The bed was very big and comfortable. The air-conditioning was a little dry, but every day ice was put in our room which we didnt use so just left the ice bucket open which helped put some moisture back into the air. The hotel is on a busy road, and you can hear the hum of the traffic. However, the disruption is minimal and more importantly the road was dead late at night so sleep was not disturbed.Breakfast was good, but maybe expensive if you had to pay for it. Luckily we had access to a free continental buffet breakfast as we are a loyalty card holder. That said, the quality of the food was good and ample  finding a decent buffet breakfast in a hotel is rare these days!The quality of the breakfast would lead me to believe that the room service would also be good. However, room service menu was limited and with so many places to eat in close proximity we didnt use this service.Staff in general were pleasant and willing to help. Much praise should go to a very helpful lady on the guest relations desk (whose name we didnt catch) who organised for my husband and I to use a room to shower and change in prior to catching our late flight, even though we had already checked out - we only asked to use the spa changing facilities!Overall this is a fantastic hotel. Despite some of the bad reviews on tripadvisor, we booked because it is a Jumeirah hotel. We were not disappointed and would highly recommend it. However, it is not a Jumeirah hotel in the Dubai sense. Its very much more face-less, has little charm (despite being beautifully decorated in the most part), and misses all the little touches that we have come to expect of Jumeirah. But you cant argue with location, a comfy bed, cleanliness and a decent breakfast!"
118,1862,"Feb 9 2008 	very luxurious	My husband and I stayed here after an evening at the opera (this was the perfect location) and were happy with our room and the service. The room was very attractive and nicely furnished, the bed was comfortable, the towels were nice and thick, and the bathroom had the most flattering lighting I have ever encountered. Service was friendly and attentive.Slight negatives: The view was of a brick wall, which was okay for the short time we spent there, but would probably be depressing for a longer stay. We had a lot of trouble getting the lights and television to turn on and off. I'm sure with some study, we could have figured it out, but when you want to go to sleep, you want to be able to just push a button and have the light turn off! There was no coffee-maker in the room, which is annoying if you like to have your first cup of coffee within seconds of getting out of bed. Finally, we were overcharged by $20 for the one item we took from the minibar -- they did correct the error after we pointed it out. These were all minor issues, and we would happily stay in this hotel again."
119,1862,"Feb 3 2008 	High style and quality at the Essex House NYC	I wanted to write about a recent stay at the Jumeirah Essex House, because I was so pleased it seemed to renew my love for old New York, high tea and Central Park.High tea is available in the lobby in the afternoon just have a seat and everything is brought to you, complete with scones, marmalades, tiny cucumber sandwiches, cookies, and of course a lovely tea service, this is open to the public. Or cocktails  sometimes youre in the mood for strawberry champagne, and maybe a more hefty club sandwich, these are also available in the lobby. For dinner, a brand new world-class restaurant is opening February 2008, shame we missed it but from the looks it will be a splendorous space, all gold, silver, mirrors, natural wood, and a menu based on local availability of the freshest food from the Farmers Market. The staff at the hotel are warm, capable people, and the concierge can direct you anywhere you need to go- he also offered Central Park walking tour mp3 players as a nice way to explore the park.The rooms are elegant, yet so comfortable, especially the beds. Also the Essex House is certainly a convenient and prime location on 59th street overlooking Central Park. The hotel interior is embellished with beautiful art, marble, and photographs, all true to the hotels Art Deco heritage and charm. This combination of quality and high style brings out what is best about staying in Manhattan, and I will return both for business and pleasure."
120,1862,"Feb 3 2008 	Nice room horrible Bath!	A great location, and a nicely refurbished hotel, Smart, but not over pretentious. The strange thing is, that having spent a lot of money refurbishing the bedrooms to a very high standard, they have left the old bath tub and tap fittings in. These fittings are really cruddy- it is no pleasure to shower in the old - chipped bath. Black mould is evident around the grouting etc, and being New York the bath tub is, as always, far too small to warrant physically taking a bathOtherwise, apart from the fact that it takes an age ( 15 minutes!) for guest services to answer the telephone it is one of the better hotels in New York. The brand new bar &amp; restaurant, whilst expensive- $8 for a coke, are super cool and fun to dine in ."
121,1862,Jan 29 2008 	Great Location great rooms and bathrooms good service	Great location on Central Park South. Rooms are very nice. Bathrooms huge with lots of space for toiletries and include a nice sized tub in addition to shower. Flat screens with all kinds of visitor info in rooms. Service in hotel was very good.
122,1862,"Jan 27 2008 	Excellent Essex	We enjoyed a great stay at the Jumeirah Essex House hotel in December to welcome in the new year.I must admit I was a little dubious after reading some earlier reviews but thought as we have stayed at the Jumeriah's sister hotels in Dubai (namely the Burj Al Arab Hotel) on several occasions and had never been disappointed that we would keep our reservations. We are so glad that we did!On arrival we were greeted with a warm smile and advised our suite was ready immediately which was nice after a long journey.The Essex House hotel has undergone a $70 million dollar renovation and we were very impressed with our Manhattan Suite accommodation which comprised of a living area, toilet/washroom, a dressing area with two double wardrobes, the double master bedroom and a bathroom with separate shower.Granted the view from the window wasn't great but it did over look Manhattan but hey I'm being picky on this minor point. The room itself was very clean &amp; ultra modern. A winner in our opinion.The Suite has nice touch of technology to spice up your stay such as two LCD TVs (one in the living room and the other in the bedroom), touch control mood lighting and a well stocked mini fridge. Perfect for myself, wife and our teenage son.In the living room the sofa doubled as a double bed and the maid service would make up &amp; put the bed away without any problems. This proved to be a great bonus as we could relax on an evening in our room with a drink &amp; TV whilst our son had his own TV &amp; privacy next door - great!Breakfast at $33 for the buffet was superb as you could basically have whatever you wanted and the quality of the food was first rate. Waffles &amp; fresh fruit an cream yum!The location of the hotel is excellent at the south of Central Park and just two minutes away from the Time Warner centre &amp; shops galore.We sampled the Jumeirah Essex House afternoon tea one afternoon which was delicious and the surroundings very relaxed. Well you can never get enough tea with warm scones, jam &amp; clotted cream!The location &amp; accommodation is excellent and the recent renovation works have brought the hotel right in to the 21st century.We travel regularly around six times per year either on holiday or business and always stay at high quality hotels and we were not disappointed with the New York addition to the Jumeriah chain.So in a nutshell if you want great accommodation, good quality service with a first rate location check out the Jumeirah Essex House you wont be disappointed."
123,1862,"Jan 22 2008 	Exceptional Essex!	Just returned from NYC with my daughter for her sweet sixteen! Her first time in NYC I really debated where to stay. Location was important and I did not want it too pretentious; a luxury hotel with a friendly atmosphere is what I was looking for. I found it here we were both very impressed by its elegant decor... rich modern not too over the top. Fantastic rooms large by NYC standards with the best bedding! The hotel is constructing a bar/restaurant to be completed by feb/08, I'll be very anxious to try it because we found the service and the food both in the lobby bar and the other restaurant to be fit for a queen &amp; princess which is how we felt staying at the Essex House! Right across from Central Park it is a land mark with perfect views of the park and shopping at your doorstep. Highly recommended!"
124,1862,Jan 19 2008 	Will definitely come back to the Essex House	I stayed at the Essex House on New years eve with my girlfriend. The staff was very friendly and accomodating to my requests. I was given a nice upgrade into one of their junior suites which was very nicely redone since the renovations took place at the hotel. The housekeeping staff was very prompt to getting to my room when I put the request in for the sofabed to be made up as I had some company in the room. Overall I would say my stay was very nice and the staff was very welcoming.
125,1862,"Jan 14 2008 	Wonderful 40th Birthday!	My husband and I just returned from our long and wonderful weekend stay at The Essex House. We stayed here 3 years ago when it was a Starwood property. We loved our stay! The newly renovated rooms are spacious and relaxing! We had a king room overlooking Central Park. We had two huge windows overlooking the park with a telescope to focus in on the park. We also enjoyed the comfortable beds, the sensored lights that turn on from the nightstands and bathroom in the dark...very cool, and flat screen television. We always had a clean room and plenty of drawer and closet space...not always the case in some NYC hotels.The bathroom...which is very important for us...what amazing! We had a huge tub and a separate tile/glass door shower! Also, the thick towels and cool rose colored bowl sink...a nice extra. The bath gel, lotions and hair products from The Cornelia Spa smelled great.. A nice touch, they remembered it was my birthday..only mentioned it when booking, a small cake and champagne in our room...how nice after a great dinner at Le Bernadin, going to Jersey Boys and a special treat when we came back!We love the Essex House...great job and pleasant staff!"
126,1862,"Jan 12 2008 	Outstanding!	My Husband, myself, and our 4 year old son stayed here for two nights before heading to my in laws in PA for Christmas. I wasn't sure if this Hotel would be suitable for a family style or the Business travelor. We were so pleasantly surprised! The rooms were brand new and large! We even had a view of Central Park. Breakfast was included daily and we felt like we were royalty. We also participated in the Gingerbread tea in the afternoon after all day out in the city, and it was a perfect respite before a late night dinner. We were so comfortable at this Hotel I would highly recommend it! The staff was overly helpful and so polite! It was like I was in another world!Gilroy, Ca"
127,1862,"Jan 2 2008 	Great hotel	I booked the hotel well in advance to spend a special weekend getaway. The rates were high, but extremely competetive with what else was offered in the city and much lower than comparable hotels, like the Ritz around the corner.From the moment we arrived the attention to detail and friendliness of the staff was outstanding. My partner had a birthday and I casually mentioned that at time of booking and on the evening of the birthday we had to our surprise a lovely cake waiting for us. Our requests for ice, extra glasses etc. were taken care of in minutes and the lady giving the wake up call in the morning even mentioned the weather (it's snowing outside). Very impressive. The Lobby is grand and the rooms are stunning. I especially loved the extra comfy beds and large mirrors in the room. Having Central Park right outside just adds to the fantastic value. We had a romantic dinner once in their restaurant (which is quite hidden). Food and service was great, couldn't have asked for more. Will definitely stay there again when in New York."
128,1862,"Dec 23 2007 	Nice hotel but expected more...	Have been to NY 5 times before, we have always stayed near Times Square/Broadway. As this will be the last visit for a few years, we wanted to try nearer Central Park for a change. Did a bit of shopping around on the internet and brochures, finding the Essex House to be one of the better hotels.Booked direct in February, securing a 'Stay Valued' rate, including breakfast and stating that 'no attention to detail would be overlooked, with those little extras', specifically against the rate description. This whetted my appetite for a great stay.We arrived around 2pm. and our Junior Suite was waiting for us, looking very nice, spacious and clean, state of the art and bright. Had a bit of trouble with the large wall mounted plasma TV in switching it on in the 1st place. It seemed to change channels of its own accord, and volume. It even switched itself on once in the middle of the night which was a bit scary! There was a small seating area, large walk in wardrobe/storage area and the bathroom seemed to be refurnished, apart from the 'old' bath. Still, all in all, pleased with the room, although the view was just of a courtyard and other hotel rooms. A little touch was when you got up in the night for the toilet, the floor lights would come in both in the bedroom and bathroom to guide your way without having to turn on the main lights. They stayed on for around another 3 minutes after keeping still, and perhaps were slightly over sensitive to some movement!Breakfast was OK. We advised that we were on the B&amp;B tariff but they weren't sure what food we could have. One of the servers said we could have the buffet, which was OK, but lacking in variety of hot and cold dishes. Service was good, especially at the meal we had on the last day in the restaurant, for dinner. The server engaged in light conversation and banter regarding Christmas and travelling etc., and the food was of good quality.I have stayed at many 5 star hotels, but when promised every attention to detail and 'those little extra's' - well, I was still waiting. I thought we might get flowers or fruit for the room etc. or half a bottle of wine, but this stay valued rate was slightly misleading, as nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Nothing wrong with that in essence as the stay was good, but with building my expectations like they did, I guess I was a little underwhelmed.On checking out, they charged me the wrong room rate and charged me for my breakfasts! The check out lady was very apologetic and helpful and it was soon sorted. All in all, a nice hotel, 4 1/2 star, well appointed room, but the promises I was made never materialised. Great location by the way, opposite the beautiful Central Park, where we had a lovely morning wondering around aimlessly!!"
129,1862,"Nov 29 2007 	Celebration spoiled by staff	I reserved a Suite at the Essex House through Quikbook for our 25th wedding anniversary celebration for 5 nights and emailed the hotel several times warning them that we would be arriving from the UK in the early hours and that we would like to be on a high floor. When we arrived at 2.30am after 16 hours travelling we were given a room on the 4th floor overlooking a shabby brick wall. I was extremely disappointed but not surprised that my communications with the hotel had been ignored. After a drawn out period of complaining that our celebration was being ruined before it had begun, the duty manager finally agreed to move us to a higher floor on our second night.The Essex House knew this was a special occasion, they had a record of my requests and copies of their staff's emails assuring me that my requests would be honoured. So I would love to know why they made the start of our stay a bitterly disappointing experience that spoiled a long-planned celebration.Aside from our problems the Essex House delivered on its reputation as a fabulous property with a sumptuous art deco interior and stunning newly refurbished rooms."
130,1862,"Nov 20 2007 	Wonderful hotel 	We went to New York in October 2007, and decided to stay at a different hotel than we usually do. We chose the Essex House and was our stay fantastic! Not only was the room perfect -- extremely updated and high-tech -- the staff was very pleasant (except for one person at check out). Our flight from the Midwest had been cancelled on a Friday night -- I called the hotel -- and they did NOT charge me, even though it was already 9:30 pm on the night I was to check in!!! I was so surprised! They were totally wonderful about it, saying it was not my fault. So we checked in on Saturday morning after we could get a flight out. When we went to check out on Sun. (we were able to get a 2 pm late check out) one nasty young lady told us that we were down for 2 nights and that we had to pay for both. I talked to the manager, and she fixed it so that we only paid for the one night, saving us $500. Later, we got home and realized that we had left a handheld video game system and game inside the room safe. We called, and no problem. Security and the front desk worked with us to return our items via courier. Jeffrey in Security was especially wonderful and held on to our items to be sent. We were sure that we would never see the items again, but we got them back. What an honest crew! We will defintely stay there when we get back to New York -- and we go 3-4 times per year! I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel!!!!"
131,1862,"Nov 18 2007	some service issues but overall great hotel...	i stayed at JEH for 6 nights in early november. rate wasn't great...paid 679 for not even a parkview but november rates were through the roof at other hotels as well. this is my third visit to this hotel. frankly, with the remodel, drop-dead location on the park and friendly staffing, i don't want to stay anywhere else. i go to new york to hit the theatre heavily. and this hotel enables you to walk there for a comfortable 20 minute walk...nice to not have to battle to find a cab. the cabs are pretty busy on central park south. only issues i had with the hotel are that it is too high tech for it's own good. the tv mysteriously came on every hour in the night and i had great difficulty turning it off...i finally had to unplug it. the lighting in the room is tricky to figure out, the high tech phones were confusing and the calking was sloppily caked around the grout line of the tub and the toilet ran a lot. the engineer and plumber were called for the tv and toilet issues but they didn't succeed to fix it. I'm not a very picky person so by unplugging the tv at night and closing the door to the bathroom so i wouldn't hear the toilet running, i was o.k. with this slight annoyance. I didn't want to move my room at this point so never asked if this was an option. i did use the complimentary bike to ride through the park which was lovely and greatly enjoyed the restaurant...a beautiful little place to have breakfast and dinner...great food by the way. so all in all, once they figure out the problems mentioned above, the hotel will be perfect."
132,1862,Nov 17 2007 	so dissapointed	To finish our holiday in the States we booked for two nights with a Central Park view with telescope. We were given a room on the third floor so of course a telescope was a complete waste of time. We had really been looking forward to the views over central park (like you see in the films) so phoned down straight away to ask for another room but was told they were full!!! The room was quite small which we expected for New York. Everything was brand new and pristine but too fancy for its own good - the TV is connected to some sort of strange set up and impossible to change channels - really weird!! The lights can be controlled on a screen but so difficult to use and then there are lights that come on by themselves by the bedside tables. These high tec things drove us mad!!! The next day we checked out as we could not bear the thought of spending half an hour to get the lights to turn off!!!
133,1862,"Nov 12 2007	No Essex girls here	I stayed at the Essex House in a wonderful room overlooking the park - it is definitely worth splashing out a bit extra for the view. I can't wait to go back when there is snow on the ground. The park view rooms come equipped with telescope so you can see whats going on in the park, muggings, stabbings, rape... no only kidding, I felt surprisingly safe walking around shopping and sightseeing on my own and walked across the park a couple of times.The Essex House is a lovely art-deco relic of a bygone era. Slightly reminiscent of Claridges in London. The staff are unfailingly polite and nothing is too much trouble.The rooms are a little bit on the small side but then again this is premium real-estate so what can you expect, just don't order room service or you will be quite cramped. There was also a chaise longue in the room. The comfort more than made up for the diminutive square footage. Incredibly soft down duvet's the best I have ever slept under with silky egyptian cotton sheets, and best of all whenever you step out of bed little multicolored lights come on from under the bedside cabinets, they switch off automatically after a few minutes. Beautiful! The usual flat screen tv, bar, bathrobe, decent toiletries, etc make it a comfortable experience.Eating out you are walking distance from Tavern on the Green, a must, but a must book to get in! Particularly on a Sunday. Also Cipriani is close by. I ate at the Helmsley just up the road, which has a slightly cheaper restaurant also with a great view. But if you are on a budget come out of the hotel and turn left and then immediately left again to find the more reasonably priced cafe's where you can get breakfast for $7 as opposed to $25 in the Essex.You can't beat the location of the Essex as the bus tours are just across the road, as well as the horse drawn carriages. Lexington and Madison Ave for shoping and the Metropolitan Museum of Art which is a good 30minute stroll up the East Side of hte Park and full of unexpected surprises.This was the first time in 20 yearssince my first trip to NY when I stayed at the Chelsea - a completely different experience. I left a very happy camper and determined to return."
134,1862,"Nov 9 2007	Nice Location Terrible Service	I lived in New York for 4 years and have stayed in A LOT of hotels there over the last 26 years. I hadn't stayed at the Essex House before but had worked film press junkets there. So when my mother and I were meeting in NY and needed a place to stay we decided to give the EH a try. The location is great because of the easy access to both east and west side transportation, but the service was severely lacking. It was atrocious. First of all, our tv was a nightmare. It never allowed for us to pick a channel. We'd press one button and it would just start wildly flipping through all the channels, finally stopping (after 2-3 min) on whatever it wanted us to watch. When we called to have someone service it they sent the phone techs up (1 hour after we called). Not sure why they were sent. They weren't sure either. The next day we called again about the tv and 2 or so hours later someone came up, looked at it and said &quot;it's new technology, the kinks aren't worked out yet.&quot; I'm pretty sure plasma tv isn't a new enough technology that the kinks haven't been worked out. I mean, I am capable of watching mine at home. Hmmm.On another occasion I called and ordered a bucket of ice around breakfast time (i'd say after the breakfast room service rush though)... TWO HOURS later it arrived. But that was after one of the phone tech guys called and said we had been waiting for hours for ice. No apology. Except from the phone tech guys. They were very nice. So, for $600 a night I think you can do a lot better. A LOT BETTER. A good location doesn't make up for really awful service. There are so many great hotels in NY, the Essex House really needs to get it's act together.Oh, and we paid for a high floor park view room with a telescope. When we got there there wasn't a telescope and we were on the 3rd floor. They brought up a telescope, but what was the point? Nothing to see from the 3rd floor."
135,1862,"Nov 2 2007 	Solid hotel	Room was very nice and updated. Great location. Check-in was a bit slow, but not terrible. Asked the doorman to hail a taxi for a short ride to a business meeting, and upon finding out our destination, offered a ride in the hotel's car service, which was great."
136,1862,"Oct 29 2007 	Awesome experience	I have used trip advisor many times to find hotels when I travel, but this is the 1st time I felt obligated to send in a review of my own. My wife and I spent the weekend at the Jumeriah Essex House and loved every minute of it. The staff was courteous and always available. The room was wonderful, with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The location could not be more fantastic. All in all we had a fabulous experience and I wound highly reccommend this hotel to anyone for future visits to New York."
137,1862,Oct 27 2007 	Short But Sweet Stay	We had been recommended this hotel by some friends...and we were not dissapointed.When arriving at the hotel we were greeted by happy smiling faces and lovely lively music!! The only problem we encountered was a delay in the room being ready - this is happening more and more these days... but the room was worth the wait...We had booked a junior suite and a beautful suite we got.... on the 31st floor.... obviously recently refurbished.The atmosphere in the hotel was wonderful - I was happy to spend small amounts of time in the hotel foyer watching the world go by .....We had breakfast in the hotel and this did not dissapoint either.The position is perfect also - just across the road from Central Park and if you like shopping then you can shop til you drop in walking distance.I cant wait to return......
138,1862,"Oct 27 2007 	Not worth the price	My wife and I checked in at 5:00 p.m. and, yet, our room was not available. We sat in the lobby bar for 45 minutes, not at all an inviting place, and ordered an $18 glass of wine and $20 cocktail - welcome to New York City! It took all that time to order our drinks and get served. In their defense, the servers were required to walk the length of the hotel to the restaurant bar to retrieve our drinks and then make the return trip to serve them. This should improve when the refurbishment is complete, but the space will still be cold and uninviting.Our room was quite small, but not uncomfortable. The furnishings had a pre-fab, modular look and feel to them. Not bad, but just not what one would expect for the price. The bath was tiny and difficult for two people to share, although the fixtures were nice.Coffee was served in the lobby each morning, but only until 7:30 a.m. One could walk down the street to the Ritz Carlton lobby and get coffee all morning. One expects a bit better for the price.All in all, we will stay elsewhere on our next trip. This is not a bad hotel, it simply is not worth the price and does not live up to its billing as a luxury hotel."
139,1862,Oct 19 2007	Do not stay here	I disliked this hotel so much and had so many bad experiences that I do not even want to to go over them again. I use trip advisor all the time so I felt like I should post some kind of warning to people. I am not one of those people who is never happy. I have written lots of glowing reviews on this website. Do not stay here. The staff really is incompetent and there must not be any managerial oversight. The ony good thing about this place is the location but NYC is easy to get around so do yourself a favor and stay at the Sofitel or the W.
140,1862,"Oct 3 2007	Staff live up to the rude NY reputation!	Great location and beautiful hotel - the air con is fab on hotter days! Concierge however pretty useless and gives the most BASIC of help and the staff, particularly on check-in and departure, so rude and short with you - no please, thank you and certainly no &quot;have a nice day&quot;!!! Not great for people with babies either. Food great (if you can tolerate the 50% of rude staff and those with chips on their shoulders)!! Would I stay there again? Yes if I was going to NY again as found 99% of people outside the hotel too rude to be true (so the hotel staff doesn't make a diff) but will probably not enter NY again as I will probably punch someone..............."
141,1862,"Sep 29 2007	there are better hotels at the same price	I stayed in one of the refurbished rooms with a rear outlook. The room itself was beautifully appointed and very luxurious - I loved the lighting and decor. The lack of a view was compensated by the room being very quietHowever, these positives are outweighed by negatives associated with othe aspects of the hotel. 1. The bathroom is not in keeping with the quality of the bedroom - the tap was hanging off the wall and the shower head was pretty old and ineffective.2. The food in the lobby was awful - an omlette was the worst I've ever eaten3. Apart from the lobby - there is no bar to enjoy a relaxing drink - a personal preference but sitting in the lobby to have a drink did not appeal4. The housekeeping in the room was pretty poor - there was little effort to tidy things up - plus no turn down service5. Some of the staff on the ground floor were distinctly unhelpfulI know that the above may sound picky - but when paying $400+ for a room - these things should be done as a matter of course and service.I think there are better places to stay for the money"
142,1862,"Sep 23 2007 	Suffering from a New York Hotel problem	Came to New York over Fashion Week, so prices were inflated beyond belief (just because there is a shortage of rooms in the city, does not give hoteliers the license to print money - there is such a thing as 'value for money' - no matter what the price tag...). We managed to get a good rate at the Jumeirah Essex House.I was keen to see the hotel, as it has seen an extensive refurbishment (close to completion) and as Jumeirah's first hotel in the USA, I was sure they wanted to make a splash.The hotel has a great location opposite Central Park. The lobby is very impressive (especially if you are an art deco fan). The disappointment comes away from the public areas. The room renovation is half baked. The new rooms are well laid out, but certainly nothing impressive. There are also touches, such as new sink and wallpaper in the bathroom, but old plumbing and showerhead. Hoteliers should distinguish between a full and soft refurbishment. They have also listened to the market's demands regarding technology and entertainment and installed over sized flat screen TV's - the problem is they are too big for the room. The phone also was a nightmare to use - very complex and with no instructions - impossible to use. One number for service in a hotel should be the standard.Not wanting to remain on the negative - there were some nice touches in the room. I liked the soft lighting in the bed headboard, good bed linen and also an easy to use alarm clock (Hotel Managers reading this - ditch the complicated clock/radio/CD).You can tell that the Unions have a strangle hold on the hotel. The staff were very much there to do a job and not to offer service to the guests. You constantly had to wait for elevators because they were full of staff (and contractors) going between guest floors. Customers did not seem the focus and you rarely saw any Management presence.One final point - the bathroom ammenities were over scented. Definately not right for male guests.I feel that the Essex House is reflective of probably most hotels in New York. You can tell that Accountants and The Unions have the upper hand. Most look tired, badly refurbished and lack any passion. I realise that money has to be made - but every price tag must reflect value at the end of the day..."
143,1862,"Sep 18 2007	Absolutely Fabulous	This place was a dream! We were treated like GODS! They really know lux here - if you have the means, I HIGHLY reccomend you stay here - you won't be dissapointed!!!"
144,1862,"Sep 17 2007	Good location but service could be better	Our first experience was having to queue to check in, and then the room not being ready even though it was 2.30pm. The least I would have expected is to be offered a free drink and quiet place to wait, but this did not happen. The luggage/bellman service was completely chaotic.The best thing about the hotel is its location right by Central Park, also the Concierge service was very efficient and helpful.The room was quite small, but we asked for and got one facing a quiet street which was good."
145,1862,"Sep 8 2007 	Fantastic Hotel	Fantastic hotel in a excellent location. Service was superb with champagne and chocolate strawberries on arrival.We booked our tour or the states through Trailfinders so we had a bargain!The rooms are beautifully decorated with a contemporary feel, with LCD tv's, quality furniture and fittings and most important of all AMAZING views over central park. We were on 8th floor.Highly recommended!!!!"
146,1862,Sep 4 2007 	Jumeirah Jolly good	We spent 6 nights at the Jumeirah NYC at the end of August and had a great stay. We were upgraded to a Central Park suite for $569 per night so perhaps I am swayed in considering this a good choice of the top end New York hotels at the moment. The investment of the Jumeirah group is obvious as is their service quality and the location excellent.
147,1862,Sep 2 2007	Fabulous hotel!	This hotel is really first rate! They have recently redone the rooms and hallways and lobby and it shines! We stayed in a suite and it was collasal (especially for NYC). The amenites are wonderful and the bed and linens were so comfy. The suite only cost $450.00 and I would not be surprised if they could sell the suite for $1000.00. It was an amazing value. The conceirge was excellent and the front desk (Patrick) was efficient and friendly. The location is great! They also offer a free limo to drive you within a ten block area around the hotel. It was a 2007 Mercedes with a driver who opens the door for you as if the car were your own!!!! All heads turned whenever we got out of that car! The only downside is that the hotel restaurant is grossly overpriced and the food is just okay.I so recommend this hotel. I absolutely will look into staying at this gem again! ENJOY!
148,1862,"Aug 28 2007 	Well done!	My wife and I recently spent 1 night at the JEH - we had a newly refurbished suite on the 30th floor which was lovely - great views of Central Park and uptown Manhattan, 2 42 inch plasma's, etc... They've put alot of money into this hotel and it shows.Our room was not ready at check-in but they gave us vouchers for cocktails in the lobby lounge, which was pleasant. Staff was friendly enough - no complaints. We would aboslutely stay here again as it is a relative &quot;bargain&quot; for Central Park South."
149,1862,"Aug 28 2007 	superb stay for family with toddler	perfect stay. everyone was so nice and friendly to us and our 2.5 year old son. very nice and quiet room on the 6th floor. view was not great, but room was quiet. great location -walk across the street to c. park"
150,1862,"Aug 18 2007 	Okay BUT	Just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel-deluxe king was smallish, but bedding and towels were high quality. Warning! Request a room that does not face 58th street, unless you wish to be awakened by construction at 7:30am!"
151,1862,"Aug 3 2007	Very Good Experience	I booked a weekend in the city through Amex. Rate was very good, better than any other website and I used points. We stayed in one of the remodeled rooms on the 4th floor (not sure if all the rooms are redone yet) and it was very nicely done, classy without being boring -- a huge improvement over the old Essex House. Not sure if they would have given me a room with a view considering what I paid, so I never asked. I was a bit surprised that the standard room only had a queen sized bed instead of a king. The room was very quiet, not a sound of anything could be heard. We hung up the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign and housekeeping stayed away. We had breakfast at the restaurant. It is on the south side of the hotel whereas the old Cafe Botanica used to face the park. While the views are less attractive (non-existent), the space is beautifully done and the service is much improved. Food was excellent, basic breakfast menu done with flair. Service again was excellent. I don't know if they plan to move the restaurant back to the front once renovations are completed. A note about renovations: I think they are mostly done with the rooms and other renovations. The front of the hotel where the restaurant used to be is boarded off so I don't know if that will become retail or reopen as part of the hotel. But it is important to note that the ongoing work was not intrusive, in fact I barely noticed. The front desk was a bit slow. I don't know what the two staff people are doing punching in so much stuff on the computer for a simple check-out but it needs to be expedited. There is an &quot;Express Check-Out&quot; box near the front desk by the porter's desk but I never received a bill under my door so it wasn't an option. The new ownership has dumped a lot of money into this place and it shows. I think they need to resolve some service issues but otherwise it provided a pleasant weekend getaway at a good discount to the truly high end hotels like the St. Regis, Pierre, etc."
152,1862,"Jul 30 2007 	Surpassed our expectations	My daughter and I I stayed at the Jumeirah Essex over an extended weekend (Thursday - Sunday) and couldn't have been more pleased or satisfied. Whomever oversees staff training is to be commended; everyone was friendly, attentive, helpful and very polite. Our Junior Suite was gorgeous; very large (including the bathroom) with a bed so comfortable that I slept soundly throughout the night. Overall, the hotel is lovely - especially the areas where renovation has been completed. The lounge off the lobby is especially pleasant and an interesting place to people watch while enjoying a cocktail. The food and beverage prices in the restaurants are high, but that is typical for a fine hotel anywhere. There are other dining options in the area, including Cafe Europa, just down the street. Yes, it was pricey, but I feel that we got what we paid for, and for once - it was a pleasant surprise!"
153,1862,"Jul 29 2007	Friendliest staff	I stay at a lot of hotels, but I can't think of any staff that is more proactively friendly than at this hotel. They smile and say hello, and if they learn your name, they use it again."
154,1862,Jul 16 2007 	Great Experience! Great Location	Enjoyed about a week at the Essex House. The new renovation is lovely with lots of interesting little touches including motion activitated night lights. Very comfortable rooms and a friendly staff. Great central location - perfect for business and for pleasure.
155,1862,"Jul 14 2007	Memorable stay	My huband and I stayed at The Essex House an celebration of my 40th birthday and we couldn't have been more pleased.Everything about this hotel was perfect from checking in to checking out.Our newly refurbished room was beautiful with a fantastic lighting system,flat screen TV,marble bathroom,luxurious bed,fluffy towels,robes and slippers.The hotel staff were very friendly and professional and treated us like old friends.We would certainly return to this hotel with its wonderful location and do not hesitate in recommending it."
156,1862,"Jul 14 2007 	The New York hotel	I have stayed in a number of 5 star hotels in New York including the Carlye - The Jumeirah beats them all.I had a room looking into the inside of the block, the view was non existant but so was any noise therefore a definate plus. The staff were friendly and helpful, even checking in at mid night.  I had been concerned reading some previous reviews about refurbishment - I suspect as a result of the very late check in I was upgraded and the room was modern with a massive TV and an unusually large bathroom. I think all the refurbishment is now complete.The location was fine, 2 blocks from 5th Avenue and walking to Times square only took about 15mins.Breakfast was expensive but reflects most 5 star NY hotels, but there are plenty options close by.And the best thing about the Jumeirah? the bed - this was so so comfortable it was like sleeping in your own bed."
157,1862,"Jul 9 2007	Horrible! Stay elsewhere until they work the kinks out	Below is the letter I just finished composing to management. Bottom line is this... they have a lot of kinks they need to work through to get this hotel in a first class league. All fluff no substance at this point. Location is great though.Customer Satisfaction: This area was poor. We requested a room on a high floor, and got a room on floor 3. To make matters worse, the air conditioning was set at 57 degrees when we arrived and was broken. The TV also didn't work. The engineer arrived at our room and claimed he fixed everything, yet 2 hours later after sitting in a cold hotel room, it was clearly still broken. The engineer came down a second time. This time he stated he couldn't fix the problem. Therefore, we requested another room. When we arrived at room #2, it was dreadfully smaller and of less quality than room #1. Frustrated, we asked to be moved to a room of similar quality as the deluxe king room we had booked. This request was granted, but we were quite furious at this point, and nothing was done to appease us to make our stay any better for the inconvenience that was caused to us.Secondly, check-in and check-out was a 30 minute experience on both ends. The people working the desks were painfully slow. There was no express check-out evident to us upon departure, and no bill was put under our door.Lastly, we set the &quot;do not disturb&quot; light on our door when we retired for the evening. Every morning at 8:30AM, housekeeping knocked on our door to clean up the room, disrespecting our wishes for disturbance. On one particular day, housekeeping even came back a second time within a 2 hour period even though the &quot;do not disturb&quot; light was on. Very disrespectful.We did not receive turn down service. I would assume that this hotel wants to be in a league of &quot;first class&quot;. I would suggest adding this service for guests of the hotel. Although it appears more crucial efforts need to be made in other areas first."
158,1862,"Jun 4 2007 	Nicely Redone Rooms	This was my third stay at this property, the second stay since it became a Jumeirah owned property. They are investing considerable resources to turn this hotel into a top-tier choice.We stayed in one of the newly renovated king rooms. The new design feels both homey and just chic enough. There is a 42 inch wall hung plasma and some nice ambient lighting features. The phone systems are new and quite advanced. The bed was comfortable, with four pillows and what seemed to be relatively new sheeting.The bathroom was partially redone, with a new vanity (it is small in this particular line of rooms) and new shelving. The tub/shower combo was a carry-over, and to my mind, represents the biggest stumbling block to this hotel competing with the big boys. A tub/shower combo doesn't really cut it these days--they should have installed a nice stand-up shower stall (a separate tub/shower wouldn't fit). The newly done lobby is nice, though check-in/out can take a while, given that there were only two desk clerks working. The bell staff was fantastic--courteous and quick. Housekeeping also did its job well. The gym is being redone, so they have a temporary facility in a conference room. It was serviceable, though nothing to write home about. I imagine the new facility will be nice. One thing that will never change about this hotel is its prime and central location on Central Park. It is a fantastic location for tourists in NYC for the first time and locals looking for a respite alike."
159,1862,"Apr 25 2007 	Excellent hotel excellent value	I have stayed here twice in the past two months (for the first time in many years). On both occasions my stay for excellent. The rooms were very comfortable, well furnished and a good value. Room service was excellent. Service throughout the hotel was very attentive."
160,1862,"Apr 17 2007 	Lovely Hotel	We spent two nights at the Jumeirah Essex House Hotel for a recent trip. After reading several so-so reviews we were a bit hesitant but decided to give it a try because of its location. It was a terrific place! Lots of old world charm in both the lobby and the rooms. The hotel is located right on Central Park with beautiful views. Our roomwas large (a junior suite) with a sitting area and desk, a very comfortable bed, and a spacious bathroom with both a soaking tub and a standing shower. The bath products were very nice and the towels were fluffy. We made two small requests and the staff was professional in accomodating us. Can't comment on the food as did noteat in the restaurant or order room service but we did enjoy a few glasses of wine in the lobby bar and both the service and ambiance were lovely. We will stay at the Essex House again and would certainly recommend it."
161,1862,"Mar 13 2007 	Fabulous location by and large professional staff	There is no doubt that this hotel offers location, location, location. Our suite was lovely and spacious and featured quite a luxurious bathroom. Unfortunately, the spa was not fully operational, as they were undergoing renovation.I found the marketing concept for Jumeriah very alluring---we respect the each guest as an individual and featured lovely scenes of Jumeriah's fabulous Dubai properties.It is my opinion that a property can not only be judged by the building but moreover by its staff. I found the concierge and reception extremely professional and courteous. The doormen were accommodating with the exception of one named Luiz, who seemed to have a bad day for all 5 days of our stay and had no problem sharing that fact each and every time you had the bad fortune to come in contact with him. Unprofessional, rude, and in my eyes, a poor reflection on this facility as a whole.Otherwise, I cannot find fault with Essex House. Look forward to visiting there again in the near future. You will not be disappointed."
162,1862,"Feb 24 2007	A Wonderful Place to Be	After a very stressful time at work, I wanted to book a getaway where I could rest when I wanted to rest, eat great food and be entertained when I was bored. New York fits that bill. I went on Travelocity and booked a last-minute getaway. I was intrigued that for a small fee that I was able to upgrade to a suite with butler service at the Essex House. The suite is bigger than my first apartment. A good sized living area with a TV, sofa, chair, desk and under a cozy, a fax machine. The bedroom houses a king-sized bed and lots of furniture to store your clothes. Iron and ironing board live in the closet that I covet, complete with padded silk hangers, heavy wooden hangers and a safe.The decor is old-fashioned hotel luxurious. There are adoarable side tables, crystal bowls, a bar set with a silver ice bucket, tray and goblets. They stock the bathroom with Penhailigon toiletries, which smell yummy. Our view isn't all that great. We're on the north side of the building with windows facing west. We can see a small bit of Central Park, a decent portion of the west side and the entirety of a brick building that obstructs the view. It's pretty at night, with lots of twinkling lights.There are tons of people working here to make our stay pleasant. Everyone is friendly, saying hello and such. A call down to the consierge yielded a recommendation to the neighborhood pizza place, Bella Vita. Highly recommend the Za and the amazing canolli (leave the gun...) Sarabeth's, a block and a half down the street, is a great place for breakfast, a bit pricy, but the English muffins are delicious and a meal in themselves. Internet is available. They give you a choice of three speeds, with varying prices. We picked 512K for $7.95 per day and it's just fine for the small bit of computer stuff we want to do.The hotel has a car that will take you anywhere within a 10 block radius, although there's a subway stop at the south end of the park that's pretty good too.What really shocks me is how quiet it is up here on the 33rd floor. No street noise, no noise at all. There are only 6 rooms up here, so that probably has something to do with it. Yes, it's cold, but it's cold in Atlanta too. The deal is too good to pass up. We have a suite that usually goes for $1000 per night (or more!) and we got it for about $300 per night. It's outrageous by any standard and a miracle for New York.I recommend that you go to Duane Reade down the street for soda, snacks and whatnot since the minibar rates are painful. I mean, I might be living like a sultan, but I don't have the bankroll of one. My husband turned to me at dinner last night and said, &quot;If you come across another deal like this again, take it.&quot; Word."
163,1862,"Feb 6 2007 	Wonderful Hotel	After reading all the negative reviews, I was not optimistic about what I'd find at this VERY expensive NYC hotel.I'll caveat this by saying that I was given a free upgrade to a junior suite on a high floor... but I found every aspect of the hotel to be wonderful. The room was large, elegant and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The desk area was efficient. The bathroom gorgious. The service was exceptionally friendly and proactive. The location was great, and I had a nice view of the Park.That being said, it is very expensive... and they keep trying to nickel-and-dime you for everything once you're there (e.g., $16 internet connection; insane mini-bar prices; room service). Even by NYC standards, this place is expensive.I would certainly stay there again on my next business trip to NYC."
164,1862,"Feb 3 2007 	very nice but not 5 stars	The room was huge. It was in very good but not perfect condition. For the price, this hotel is very good but not excellent."
165,1862,"Jan 22 2007	Shocking!	Nice in appearence - that is until you step into the corridor leading to your room! Holes in the roof where the sprinkler system was being upgraded wasnt a problem - but when the workers failed to clear up their mess for 3 days - then this was a problem.The staff were not particulary freindly, infact the cleaners ignored the door signs of 'Privacy please' and ignored ' make my room' signs - infact on 3 of the 5 days we stayed, house keeping were called to supply towels for the room - they only supplied enough for 1 person even though we were 2 in one of the KIng bed rooms. Housekeeping were also twice to supply new batteries for the smoke alarm - safety should not be something which you should have to chase!The bathroom was appauling - mould on the walls and wall paper peeling off.Definately not worth the $450+ a night.On the up side - the location was great and forget the bed size etc - you would be better off securing yourself a park veiw."
166,1862,"Jan 15 2007 	Great Hotel	The Essex House Hotel is a great hotel with a great location. It was in close proximity to everywhere I needed to be while in town on business. I've stayed at plenty of other Manhattan hotels and the Essex House is by far the best. It is luxurious and the staff is attentive, polite, and very cordial. Everyone from the doormen to the elevator men was very friendly. Peter, one of the concierge staff, was extremely helpful when I had questions about the hotel services. The room was a little dated but still luxurious. The furniture seems a bit worn but still elegant. Some reviewers seem a little too hard to please, because the Essex House is a luxury hotel, but it is also one of the oldest luxury hotels in the city and I believe it has aged well. The rooms in the Waldorf-Astoria, renowned for its name and location in New York City, are equally as dated as the Essex House. However, I am sure after the renovations at the Essex House are through, the hotel will be even more amazing than it already is. The bathroom in my room was awesome. It was incredibly large and all marble. I thoroughly enjoyed my two night stay at the Essex House and will definitely be staying there again."
167,1862,"Dec 23 2006 	Beware of the NY super sized roach!	I booked a one night stay at the Essex House for my husband and myself. We live in Long Island, but just wanted to be &quot;tourists&quot; in the city. The hotel is in an excellent location. Not far from all of the most desired locations one would like to see in NY. It's directly across from Central Park. We didn't get a park view room, but we did book a King bed on a high floor. The check in was very quick, the front desk was extremely pleasant. We were given a room on the 16th floor. There weren't any surprises with the booking. We were given a King bed and a marble bath just as described during the booking. The room was very comfortable. We just weren't &quot;wowed&quot; by the room. What upset me the most was that the next morning, we found the LARGEST roach you could imagine &quot;hanging out&quot; in one of the corners of the room!!!! I was SOO happy that we were on our way out when we noticed it!!! Listen, I know NY...I was born and raised here and have seen a lot, but how did this &quot;bugger&quot; show up on the 16th floor in of ALL rooms....ours??? Unfortunately, this is my memory of the Essex House....the bug. However, for those that are lucky enough not to encounter a bug, it's not a bad place to stay. The morning of our check out, we were still planning on doing some sightseeing and we were able to store our luggage at the hotel until we returned without any hassle. The staff was definitely accommodating."
168,1862,"Dec 23 2006 	Fantastic	We have just spent four nights on honeymoon at this beautiful hotel. We had an executive room on 33rd floor with amazing view of central park. The staff were friendly and attentive and made us feel extremely welcome, particularly Patrick on reception. The room was large and clean. Obviously at the moment the hotel is undergoing some changes as it has been taken over by the Jumeriah group. The spa was shut for renovation as was one of the restaurants but this didn't effect our stay.The location is perfect. Would recommend it to anyone."
169,1862,"Dec 17 2006 	A wonderful Christmas visit	We had a wonderful time on this return trip! Jumeirah had taken over management of the hotel since our last visit but we were pleased to see many of the same staff from last year. The lobby and bellstaff are warm and welcoming even on such a busy weekend. The concierge staff were very helpful with show and restaurant suggestions/reservations. The rooms are in need of a little TLC but expect that will come with the new ownership. Breakfast in the lobby restaurant was lovely each day. The location is great, right on Central Park South."
170,1862,"Dec 14 2006 	Welcome to Hotel Garbage	I'm not sure I understand what some of the people here have written about the Essex House, but let me tell you all the truth.The Essex House, while it's a great locations, is a pathetic excuse for a hotel. While checking in, the woman was a total wench - cold.When we got to our room, which was supposed to be a suite, it consisted of one room (not including the bathroom) and was very tiny and worn. Furniture was chipped and old; window treatments very worn; floor tired and old; windows were tiny, and the list goes on.Now, I realized NYC hotels are normally small, but this was ridiculous. We payed around $800 and it was just so tiny.Not worth the stay by any means.On a positive note, the staff was pretty nice, but just about all of them were foreign."
171,1862,"Dec 11 2006 	Great Time in NYC!	The location is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!! We were able to walk to shows on Broadway and to a concert at Lincoln Center. In our room, overlooking the park, we could leave the window open and hear the clip clop of the horse drawn carriages.We had a very nice luncheon in the restaurant. We did have an ongoing issue trying to get ice to our room. There were no ice machines on the individual floors and it took numerous phone calls over several days (the first day, we gave up and went out) to get ice to our room.The decor in the rooms is tired and needs updating (I'm sure that's in their planning), but hey, we were able to sit by the window with a glass of brandy and gaze over the park as the sun set, which was heavenly. It's the kind of place which, if you just sit back (preferably with a drink and think about packing your own ice) and enjoy where you are without looking too closely to the finish work, you can love."
172,1862,"Dec 7 2006	Essex House - Ghost of Old New York	I came to New York to see some shows and shop. Since it was last minute everything was booked. I should have suspected something was up when I was easily able to book at room at the Essex House. The public areas, restaurant and bar are all very nice. But you leave all that when you go above the first floor. For $700+ a night I had a room that was not only the size of my closet, but hasn't been updated or spruced up for at least 30 years. The carpets are stained and worn, the furniture is so banged up I doubt that Salvation Army would take it and the bathroom was a joke. When I turned on the shower water spurted all over the bathroom from the pipe connection in the wall. The cold water faucet emitted only a tiny trickle of water. Far from being a luxury hotel in any sense of the word. I felt like I had been taken advantage of.It's a great location, right across from the park, but I can't recommend it to anyone."
173,1862,"Nov 24 2006 	Amazing experience	My husband and I booked this hotel to celebrate our 15th anniversary and were treated to an amazing experience. I contacted the hotel directly over the 3 weeks prior to our arrival with questions etc.. and each time was dealt with in a warm, professional and helpful manner. When we arrived we were upgraded, for a nominal fee, to a suite and were greeted with chilled champagne, fruit and chocolates as an anniversary gift from the hotel. The concierge was very helpful in recommending local restaurants and each staff member we came across greeted us with a smile and said hello. The location is the best in New York and we easily walked to our destinations from here. The suite was beautifully decorated with elegant furnishings, a huge marble bathroom and lovely toilettries. The bed was incredibly comfortable and undoubtedly the best hotel sleep we ever experienced! The views onto Central Park were beautiful, and for us, worth the extra expense for a Park View room.This was our first trip to New York and based upon the excellent experience we had at the Essex we would definitely return. We spent three nights here and therefore could judge the service to be consistently wonderful!!!!!"
174,1862,Nov 22 2006 	Amazing trip	I was a little concerned as there are so many bad reviews but this place was great. We booked a park view suite and it was an amazing view. It was the largest room I have ever stayed in in New York. The bed really is amazing. The staff were great and friendly and the location is incredible. Highly recommended!
175,1862,"Nov 17 2006 	Surpised!!!	Surprised!!!... at the bad reviews on here!I was a little dubious prior to visiting this hotel as to what I had let myself in for following a number of poor reviews on this site. Yes there are renovations going on, but once inside your room you don't notice them.We got lucky with a free upgrade to a park view room on the 8th floor. There was plastic in the hallways for the renovations on the 8th floor, but that wasn't going to spoil our stay. The room was beautifully appointed, very clean and a great view over central park. The bed was amazingly comfortable, probably the best bed I've slept in other than my own bed. We didn't really use the hotel facilities as there is far too much going on in NY than to sit about in the hotel.I would very much recommend this hotel to anybody visiting NY, yes there are rennovations in progress but not to the point that it upsets your stay!"
176,1862,"Nov 14 2006 	Lacked attention to detail other than how to charge	Whilst it has all the plush trappings of a de luxe property, the lack of attention to detail at the room level failed to give an overall good impression. Broken light fitting in the closet remained on the shelf in bits for the duration of our 3-night stay; the safe had been unplugged and I had to root about behind the furniture to reset it; the TV armoire would not close as the door was broken; the breakfast order form had already been used by another guest from another room and was never replaced for the duration of our stay. On the plus side the duty manager was very apologetic and made it up to us and the concierges, Ken and Christine, warrant a mention as they were extremely helpful with some complicated restaurant reservations, getting train times and organisation of other travel requirements. It was a shame that our first stay at the Essex House was marred by the lack of attention to detail. Interestingly, much is done to remind the guest that this is now a Jumeirah hotel, but many of the staff are still seen with their Westin branded name badges. Overall a tired hotel, but superbly located."
177,1862,"Nov 14 2006 	Marathon Runaround	In preparation of my participation in the New York marathon, our room had been reserved for over 8 months with the Essex House. It had been booked by our sporting agent who confirmed in writing that a park view room would be available for all marathon runners. When we arrived at midnight, we were directed to the 8th floor which was being renovated (plastic sheeting everywhere) and our room was located in the far corner of the hotel with grey, marked walls, dirty beige carpet and a small window looking out on to an office. We asked reception to move us and we agreed to vacate the room the following day. Of course, by this time, the 'all rooms are fully booked' excuse came up and our new room, although on the 16th floor, had the exact same poor decor and the view now looked out on to a brick wall. With the marathon looming and my patience limited, I decided to focus on the race. What a shame the hotel management could not have been more accommodating and welcoming to me after I'd travelled from the UK with the purpose of enjoying one of the best events that New York offers. One free breakfast was the only compensation made. I would have preferred a comfortable room with a view....afterall, it had been booked for 8 months."
178,1862,"Nov 10 2006 	Tired Overpriced and OLD Hotel - Avoid at all costs.	Given room as compensation for a speaking engagement in NYC for two nights, so I did not even pay for the room... That said, this is definitely one of the worst &quot;high end&quot; hotels in NYC I have ever stayed at, and I am a very frequent business and pleasure visitor to NYC.Although the lobby area is grand and ornate, the beauty of this hotel stops on the ground floor. Will not even go into the ongoing construction of apartments in this building and the very ugly exterior entrance.The hotel rooms look as though they have not been touch since the 60's or 70's (and to bolster that claim, just look to the 70's era touch tone phone in the bathroom and the 60's era dial phones in the floor lobby). Furrniture, fixtures and carpet are very shabby for a 4+ star hotel, especially one that was charging my hosts over $600 per night for the privilage. Room was extremely small - Very much felt like a typically &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; experience, but without ice or drink machines on any floor (you need to call for everything and they take forever).Although most of the the bell, housekeeping, door and security staff are very pleasant and helpful, this does not translate to the reception, conceirge or room service areas. Phone calls to reception took ages, everything from the drinks to the roqm service menu are terribly overpriced, even by NYC standards. Requested a pack of smokes for a guest to be delivered to the room from the gift shop ($8) and was told upon delivery the charge was $28 ! When I checked into the room and called the front desk to complain about the room condition and to ask if where was another room available, was on hold about 20+ mins, just for them to tell there was nothing they could do for me.."
179,1862,"Oct 30 2006 	Couldn't ask for more	We had a very enjoyable weekend stay in NY at the Essex House on Central Park South. Staff was friendly and helpful. I was a little concerned about the renovations, however, did not notice anything inside (exterior had some scaffolding). Our room was 4th floor city view, but it was only $300/night on expedia, so it was great value. I imagine the higher floors with park views must be amazing. Comfy pillow top bed, only issue was with heat but we were able to solve that ourselves by just opening the window for a bit.Cannot ask for a better location. We went shopping to 5th ave (1.5 blocks), central park for walks (across street), MOMA (about 4 blocks), and, the dining within 1 block is amazing. per se is the ultimate dining experience, imho, for food, service, ambiance - and its only 1 block away in the time warner center. Rated #8 in the world for good reason. Alan Ducasse in the hotel is great too (top 40 in the US), but per se is on its own level. We got to visit the kitchen in per se, they even have a TV feed directly to the French Laundry (chef Keller runs both). Rue 57 (2 blocks away) is a nice lunch spot, about $15 for a salad.Not sure what changes are in store for next year with the new mgmt, but we really enjoyed our stay here!"
180,1862,"Oct 30 2006 	Overpriced and overrated	I stayed here with a conference group in mid September and found it to be very average. Yes it is ornate and the entry is Grand etc but when I found out what the room cost was, over $1,000 per night (I didn't actually pay as it was part of the conference qualification) I nearly passed out. To say it is not worth half the money is no exaggeration. It was quite possibly the smallest hotel room I have ever been in to the point where the cupboard doors did not open fully as they hit against the bed! We also found the conceirge generally aloof and unhelpful and on the day of our departure there was a stuff up with all our luggage of mammoth proportions. Sorry but that is unacceptable from a supposed world class hotel. From here I moved to the Marriott Marquis after the conference and found it to be a far superior hotel at almost half the price. Would never stay here again."
181,1862,"Oct 11 2006 	Great Hotel...Even Better Location!!!	My wife and I stayed at the Jumeirah Essex House during the Thanksgiving long weekend (Columbus Day in the US). We are already planning our next trip back to NY and without question, we will be staying at the Essex House once again.From the moment we pulled up in our cab, there was someone there to take our bags, hold the door and after check-in, they were there to take you to your room. The staff was very courteous; everyone says 'hello' and asks how we were enjoying our stay. The concierge was a great resource and recommended some truly great dining.The room nice (standard room) and the bed despite being just a queen, was very comfortable. The bathroom was fabulous! The multiple shower heads made sure every morning started off right. I also enjoyed that they have a nice hair dryer, rather than those small ones you find at some hotels. The view was not great, so next time we'll pay the extra and get a park view room.The location of the hotel is ideal. 13 blocks from Times Square, 1 1/2 from 5th Avenue shopping, across the street from Central park, about 10 blocks from the Upper West side. The Subway is close by and getting a taxi is easy (and cheap).Great Hotel...Great Location...you won't be disapointed."
182,1862,Oct 6 2006 	Great hotel stay!	What a great hotel in a stunning location We felt spoiled for three days. Only complaint is that there was a stain on the bedskirt. I didnt report it just to see if they would change it. which they did not. Other than that the Hotel room was beautifully appointed and very clean. The staff was very efficient and courteous. We plan on staying there on our future trips which are two to three times a year.
183,1862,"Oct 4 2006 	Essex House was a Good Place in DEC '05	My wife and I visited NYC for the first time ever last Christmas &amp; New Years -2005. I insisted we stay in a hotel across from Central Park and that FACED Central Park.Essex house was one of the few and dwindling it seems. It is SPLIT into separate &quot;hotels&quot; sort of. One starts at the 26th or there-abouts floor and the former Essex House is below those floors.WARNING: BE SURE TO CHECK-IN EARLY AND ASK FOR A ROOM AT FLOOR 8 AND ABOVE !!!!!!!! Otherwise you'll have alot of street noise (it seems the cabs never stop honking) cause this can be a busy location on Central Park South. MORE IMPORTANTLY IS THE VIEW OF THE PARK !!!!!! YOU WANT TO BE ABOVE THE TREE-LINE.At that time, before Jumeria, it was reasonably priced, comparatively speaking, for a NYC hotel of that stature AND in that location. About $350-500/night. The new prices are MUCH higher now.The room was adequate and small (a QUEEN bed room with 2, 3 and 4 feet left around the bed, enough closet space and a large bath.), but we spent little time there.I mean really now!!!! It's NYC. We were out til ** 2AM ** OFTEN, sometimes just walking around TIMES SQUARE. Eating late meals at the DELI's.... Especially ARTIES on the Upper West Side.SO LOCATION IS IMPORTANT. Even though we were not at the room alot, I had enough time in it to appreciate the location across from and view of the Park. So it was worth the extra $$$ to me to have it. IMHOThe Staff was OK, the Bar was OK, The Door on 58th is locked too early. Cabs are plentiful in front. They accomodated our request for a higher floor the next day.IF the price had not changed I stay there this year too."
184,1862,"Sep 16 2006 	Wait for the completion of renovations....	The new owners are attempting to restore this classic hotel to its former glory; no doubt they will succeed, but it will take time. The location is excellent; at the southern end of the Park. Our suite was quite nice. However, the massive amount of renovation work added noise and dust. Further, the staff, while quite pleasant, are on edge, possibly because of turnover and demanding new owners. I would give them a year to complete the transition before booking another visit."
185,1862,"Sep 13 2006 	A Disappointing Stay	I stayed at the Essex House on the evening of September 11 after our corporate travel agent praised the property for its lavish rooms, wonderful views and great service. Sadly, my experience was very disappointing, especially given the price ($379) (and after enjoying wonderful stays at the Ritz and the Hilton in the past 10 days).I stayed in room 531 (spacious by NYC standards and clean) which looks directly into the windows of another room (so much for the view!) and boasts a bathroom with a broken sink fixture and rusty, mismatched shower fixtures. Overall the room looked shabby and very depressing.I ordered dinner from room service after coming back from business meetings at 10:30 in the evening and the food was good, arrived quickly and the presentation was great. The next morning I got up at 6:30 so that to get some breakfast before checking out at 8:30 only to find out that the room was missing the breakfast menu and that breakfast choices are not included in the in room dining brochure in the room. I called the room service (once) and a manager (3 times) between 6:45 AM and 7:45 AM pleading for a menu so that I can order to no avail. The menu arrived at 8:05 AM just before I headed down to check out. I must say that I have not gone through so much trouble in order to spend money in any other hotel. All the employees I spoke to about this unacceptable treatment apologized but it was obvious that they did not genuinely care about what happened. This afternoon I was contacted by the hotel with another apology (but no offer for any monetary or other compensation, in case you are wondering, which is fine with me since this was a business trip) and a request that I do not take the hotel off my list of hotels to stay in while in NYC. Given the choice of hotels in NYC, I simply see no reason to return!So, overall, I experienced a dumpy room and bad service in a reputedly good hotel. Based on my experience, I would recommend that people stay elsewhere (after all, New York is full of wonderful hotels) or if you choose to stay at the Essex House make sure before you arrive that you have a guaranteed room with a decent view and be prepared for unpredictable service."
186,1862,"Sep 10 2006	Average @ Essex House	Stayed at Essex House over labor day weekend. Got a decent rate on hotels.com. At their regular rate the stay would have been dissapointing. Pros...Staff (except bellmen) seemed to have an upbeat and welcoming professional feel, probably the Jumeirah influence. Room was clean, small, and unspectacular. King bed lower floor city facing. Hotel lobby areas and general appearance were meticulous.Cons...Bellman takes bags from us after taxi driver pulls them out of cab, follows us to the front desk and waits almost with hand out for a tip (two light roller bags), which I grudgingly give. It takes so long for the bags to arrive, my wife and a friend bring them up. This was poor form and lazy on their behalf. Room service was inconsistent sometimes room was cleaned well, other times non-existent.Since we weren't spending much time in the room it wasn't disspaointing, but it wasn't 4 star. I would hope that Jumeirah can impress their normally flawless service on the entire staff, so this hotel can eb restored to glory after years of starwood mediocrity. By the way I think management is doing a great job of keeping noisy renovations away from guests, it is obvious a major overhaul was ongoing from teh workers in and out, but we never heard a peep. This is impressive considering similar situations I have been in before."
187,1862,Sep 9 2006	A great stay at the Essex House	We stayed at the Jumeirah Essex House for 4 nights from September 1st. The location is fabulous right across from Central Park and we were fortunate to have a park view on the 14th floor.We got a good deal through Quikbook of $228 a night and this was great value for this hotel. Rooms were a decent enough size and were very comfortable. The rooms are due to be renovated by Jumeirah and this is a good thing as they are starting to look a little tired for a hotel at the higher end of the market.The staff at the hotel were always very pleasant and accomodating and could not be faulted.I would stay here again but will probably never get such a good rate in the future.
188,1862,"Sep 9 2006 	Art Deco Splendour	Had a fantastic stay at The Essex. We had a lovely room with a view over the park on the 14th floor. The view is breathtaking and room was well appointed. The bathroom was nice, especially the double headed shower. Bed very comfy. Cannot recommend the place highly enough."
189,1862,"Aug 30 2006 	Excellent Place!!	We stayed at The Essex House for a weekend recently and had a truly wonderful experience. The location was simply perfect, a few steps from Central Park and all the amenties of mid-town Manhattan. The room was comfortable and the hotel bar was a great place to relax. I highly recommend this hotel especially if you can get a good deal! For dinner - Rue 57 near the hotel is an excellent French Brasserie and the Brooklyn Dinner is a top place for breakfast/brunch."
190,1862,"Aug 30 2006 	Really nice hotel	I orginally booked an unknown hotel through Hotwire and was given the Barclay Intercontinental in NYC. 2 Days before I was due to arrive there I received an email from Hotwire to say they had overbooked us and were moving us to the Jumeirah Essex House. I checked it out on the website and it looked nice so I was pleased, especially since Howire were refunding 1 nights stay for us! When we arrived we were early, well before the check in time of 3pm, but they were very accomodating and let us check in to our room immediately. The room was very nice, clean and quiet. There was a nice bathroom and the bed was very confortable. Room was very big for NY standards. The rest of the hotel was being refurbished but you would never have known. I had the best nights sleep ever, and would definately return again."
191,1862,"Aug 11 2006	I miss it already!	My husband and I spent our 10th anniversay in NYC and what a great time we had! The Essex House was a very pleasent surprise! The location right across the street from Central Park and literally around the corner from 5th Avenue shopping was more than one couple could ask for. Yes, the hotel is undergoing some renovations but you would never know as we never heard any noise. Our room was very clean, nice sized, clean bathrooms, a/c and a view of the park! We felt as if we had our own doorman and were living in a Park Avenue aprtment! The staff was great and very friendly too. Only one complaint and really not a complaint: the bathroom vanity was on the small side but then everything is in NYC!**Terrific car service from JFK to our hotel: Pat's Lincoln Towncars 917-412-0544 ( the nicest New Yorker you will ever meet!)**Best CheeseCake: Carnegie Deli on 7th AvenueThanks Essex House and Trip Advisor! We will be back!"
192,1862,"Aug 8 2006 	Nice Hotel	The Essex House is undergoing it's Jumeirah makeover and when complete I'm sure it will be one hell of a hotel. In the meantime for the rates I paid I was pleasantly surprised. My room was superb, the bed was out of this world and the location of the hotel couldn't have been better, great location and extremely quiet.My only gripes are that the bar is expensive, the staff could do with being trained on how to deal with customers the Jumeirah way, and the internet was not free! :(Would I stay there again? Yes, if the rates were as good as I got at the time :)"
193,1862,"Jul 30 2006	NIce stay on the park	I was on a brief trip to New York where I knew I would have people coming to my hotel room and wanted to make a good impression. The Essex House, adjacent to Central Park delivered. I had one of the smaller suites. It had two bathrooms, a living room with a couch and two chairs, as well as a well appointed bedroom. The views were quite nice and the furnishings were adequate. Some of the items were a bit dated and showing use. However, in general the hotel was quite nice. The location is great. We took a good afternoon walk through the park to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (take a cab if you're not into long walks). When we returned from an evening on the town we had a final drink in the hotel bar. The crowd was nice and the service was great. The atmosphere in general was very nice. I'd recommend an Essex House stay to just about anyone."
194,1862,"Jul 17 2006	Hated it!!!	I booked my one night stay through broadway.com. I was told by the broadway.com rep that I would have a room with a view of Central Park. I had no such view. The room I had was in the back of the hotel, the only view was of other rooms. The water in the toilet ran continuously after flushing. I had to call the front desk twice because the tub was backed up. The first time someone came and did not resolve the problem even though he claimed that he had. The second time the problem was resolved. Later in the evening I was getting ready to go out and needed an iron. The iron in the room did not work properly so I called the front desk and asked for another one. I waited twenty minutes and still no iron. I called the front desk again and finally a working iron was brought up to my room. When I was ready for my night out I walked out to hail a cab. The doorman tried to take my cab and give it to a guest of the ballroom at this hotel. It was horrible and totally not worth the money. Checking in was also a terrible experience because the woman I spoke with was smug. I felt like an unwanted guest. I e-mailed my comments on the hotel website. I waited for 5 days and no answer. I e-mailed once again and received a response with an apology and was told that for my next stay I would receive a complimentary suite upgrade. Why would I possibly want to spend my hard earned money to stay there again. I do not recommend this hotel. I also e-mailed broadway twice and when I finally received a response I was disappointed. The rep apologized and then went on to state that they had positive reviews from other customers."
195,1862,"Jul 14 2006 	Loved it!!	We had a great stay at this hotel. The front desk was very helpful and the rooms were immaculately clean. We had just a standard queen room. The beds were fantastic and it was very quiet. The location is fantastic, right in front of central park, and within walking distance of great shops and times square.We will definately return to this hotel!"
196,1862,"Jul 7 2006	Great hotel experience!	We finally found the perfect New York City hotel, and we plan to stay here every time we return to the city. We usually stay at Starwood hotels but the Essex House has been bought by the Dubai Arab-owned Jumeirah chain. They are in the middle of completely renovating this beautiful hotel though we couldn't hear or see any work being done. The gorgeous marble lobby welcomes you into a clam oasis from the excitement of the city. Directly across from Central Park between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, the location is perfect for Fifth Avenue shopping or Theatre District energy. We stayed in a fifth floor Park View room which was ideal for enjoying the green of the park and watching horse and carriages and park activities. The view from the upper floors is breathtaking if you prefer to be above it all. The beds are the comfortable Westin Heavenly beds though everything is going to be replaced. The furniture and rugs have a tired look so this is just in time. The service is outstanding, friendly and extremely prompt. My husband and I shared the large breakfast in our room. Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared. We asked for a fluffy down comforter and wool blanket which were delivered quickly. The rooms have doorbells by the way. We booked through Quikbook and got a very good rate."
197,1862,"Jul 3 2006	Better Than Expected	First of all, the location is perfect. Central Park is right across the street and major shop meccas within a 15 or twenty minute walk. The bed itself was comfortable, the bedding clean and not at all worn. Great workdesk with broadband. The bath amenities are top drawer - Penhagligon. The staff was friendly and accomodating. All in all, a very comfortable stay. Also found a great deal, which was a bonus ! I will be back."
198,1862,"Jun 6 2006	Will stay there next time	Stayed with my partner in Astor suite of Jumeirah Essex House on the week-end 26-29 of May. The price given on the web-site (USD 599) is absolutely great for the location and the huge suite, much better then with other 5 star neighbours. Really enjoyed excellent service and fantastic view on the Central park! Only small disapointment in service: requested 6 USD flat fare for the request to bring cutlery... strange for 5 star and suite quests. But will stay there next time for sure!!"
199,1862,"May 24 2006	What a magnifcent place!!!!!	I was hesitant to stay at the Essex House after I read some of the reviews on Tripadvisor. All I can say is throw out the bad reviews! This place is magnificent!!!!The Tripsadvisor rating of #122 of 328 hotels is WAY too low. I was looking for any excuse to regret our decision to stay there and I NEVER found it. The people ar great, the room is superb with many amenities and the location on south Central Park is perfect. Believe it or not you can actually stay in New York and not hear sirens and horns all night! This is the place for your next New York trip."
200,1862,"May 12 2006 	Small rooms and old furniture	I stayed one night at Jumeirah Essex House on May 2, 2006. Had the room booked for 3 more nights but checked out the next day and moved to Tribeca Grand Hotel. Here's the reason why. My room was extremely small, 2 people barely fit. Furniture is very old with old TV tubes that didn't work well and toilet leaked. I called front desk twice and waited for someone to fix the toilet and no one ever came. If one is paying for quality, one should get quality specially if this hotel is rated with 4 stars which it doesn't deserve. And everyone around this hotel is old. So if you're over 50 this is the place to stay but if you're under 35 which I am, this is not the hotel for you! Only positive note, location which is across from Central Park and I had a park view room which was great but still not worth the tiny room with old furniture. Pay the same price and stay at a newely renovated hotel like Doubletree Midtown or W Midtown with flat screen TV and Tribeca Grand was awesome."
201,1862,"Apr 19 2006 	Unparalleled location excellent service!	Spent four nights at the Essex House and enjoyed the outstanding service as well as the superb location on Central Park South. The hotel welcomes guests with a warm &amp; wet washcloth after they check in, and that sets the tone for the attentive service one receives from an eager to please to staff. My room lacked a view, but at the extraordinary price of $249 a night, how could I complain? Some of the nice touches: first class toiletries in the marble bathroom, a very comfortable mattress and more pillows than one would ever be able to use. The NY Times and Wall Street Journal were at my door every morning (even the Sunday Times on Sunday morning!).... For breakfast nearby, try the excellent PAIN QUOTIDIEN bakery on 7th Avenue &amp; 58th Street. For lunch, a pastrami sandwich at the CARNEGIE DELI on 7th Avenue &amp; 55th Street is a must (just don't get a hernia lifting it!)."
202,1862,"Apr 6 2006	Great hotel fantastic location excellent service	Spent 5 nights at the Jumeirah Essex House in March 06, over St Patricks Day. The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping on 5th Ave, wandering in Central Park and of course, was fantastic for the St Patricks Day Parade.The reception and concierge staff are very helpful and the lobby itself is spectacular - beautiful flowers every day. The room was a good size and the beds very comfortable. Only negative was that the air conditioning was noisy and difficult to get the temperature just right.The bar is very pleasant (expensive, although that's hotel bars for you I guess!) and the bartenders are friendly.Its very easy to get around from the hotel, either by taxi or subway and its well positioned for all the usual sightseeing and shops."
203,1862,"Mar 29 2006	Very nice hotel.....	This hotel is excellently placed for tourists.We were on floor 10 in a deluxe park view room. The view really was excellent. The bedroom was a fair size, the bed was huge and very comfortable. The furniture and paintwork were a little tired although I think now the hotel is owned by Jumeirah it will have a makeover.I have stayed at Jumeirah hotels in Dubai and they really are 1st class.The bathroom was very nice with plenty of towels and toiletries.The lobby and elevator areas are amazing, very plush.All the staff were pleasant. The breakfast was lovely with very good service.There is a nice bar in the hotel with very tasty bar snacks. The service there was very fast.There are horse and carriages lined up opposite the hotel, we took one on a ride around the park, definately worth doing!We will certainly use this hotel again. It will be good to see exactly what Jumeirah do to it."
204,1862,"Mar 25 2006	Enjoyable Stay at Essex House	We had booked this hotel for a special trip when it was still part of the St Regis brand so were a bit apprehensive after reading some of the other recent reviews particularly those written after the take over by Jumeirah. We needn't have worried. Check-in was smooth, the room was a fairly good sized park view room (excellent outlook) on the 32nd floor which meant it was away from the street and quiet and we found the staff to be friendly and helpful without exception. We had two minor gripes which, whilst not detracting from our trip prevented us from awarding the hotel 5 out of 5. The first was the complimentary drinking water in the room which is not replenished on a daily basis. Jumeirah expect that guests should purchase water from the mini bar. Not really acceptable for a hotel of this standard. Also the robes only materialised on the last night of our 4 day stay. As a hotelier myself, I know that it is the little touches that matter and Jumeirah fell short on these. It is early days though and we would certainly return to this hotel after the planned refurbishment to see how things have progressed."
205,1862,"Mar 4 2006 	Reliable and comfortable	Stayed here several times over the years when it was a Westin, and recently after change in management.This is a traditional grand hotel, magnificent lobby, plush public areas, top-notch service. Standard rooms like I stayed in are a bit small and usually don't have views, but do (still) have the Heavenly bed, expensive decor, and nice baths. On my most recent visit, I noted the room could use a little freshening, even though housekeeping is fine.Location is a mixed bag. Directly on Central Park, which is great in nice weather, but a little removed from midtown.TripAdvisor doesn't allow half-star ratings but if it did, I would rate 3.5 stars rather than 3."
206,1862,"Feb 17 2006	Mixed bag	We stayed 4 nights at the Essex House. Had stayed there two years before. This trip, though, we got off to a bad start. Had requested in my email reservation to have a high floor. Requested a park view queen room. My husband walked up to the desk and was told that the room would be on the third floor...all others not yet available until 3 pm. He came and told me...I said we would wait. He went back to the desk and said we would wait (I had read that the low floors facing the park were noisy). All of a sudden a room on the 7th floor suddenly became available! Give me a break...we took it. Got to the room. Upon first use of the toilet, it wouldn't quit flushing...water was just pouring thru it like Niagara Falls. Finally my husband went in the bathroom, took off the lid and made some sort of adjustment and it stopped flowing. Room looked ok, just like 2 years before. But...my husband was sleeping closest to the heat duct (in the ceiling) and it made a vibration as it cycled on and off all night long. He didn't sleep well. Called downstairs the first morning and they said they would fix it. Got back to room late for the second night's sleep and it was not fixed. Upon calling downstairs, they said the engineer had been there and had done something to it. We tried letting the fan run continuously the second night and it was a little better but not much. Meanwhile in the bathroom, the lighting was terrible. Can light over the toilet was burned out. Can light over the sink was very dim...something like a 67 watt bulb and it was about 8 to 10 inches up inside the can. A makeup mirror with a little light on it was attached to the wall beside the sink but you couldn't get at it to see yourself...totally useless. Also this day we were left with no wash cloths at all. My husband complained about the vibrating heating system again and this time he was still in the room when the engineer came. The guy was nice and trying to help. Thought he helped it but soon it became obvious that it was reverting to its original ways. The next day I let the engineer in after calling and watched what he did. Noticed that the furnace filter seemed to rub against something. Also saw a previous repair job consisted of jamming a towel up inside the thing! Engineer left. I left. My husband came back to our non-smoking room a bit later and said the smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming, as if somebody had just left the room while smoking. Offended, he called back downstairs. They offered to move us for about the 4th time (but I didn't want to suffer thru all the packing again). Now it's the third night...vibrations start up. We take my nail file and open the ceiling panel. Take out the furnace filter and close the lid back up. No more vibrations! So for the third and fourth nights we did get some sleep--both of us. I complained about all this downstairs at the desk. They called for the front end manager to meet me over at the desk. Nicki was very nice...very understanding and apologetic. Told about the big takeover and the soon to be infusion of big cash for remodelling. I told her about the light in the bathroom and the heat. Felt for this price we deserved more. She said to please give them another chance and come back in about a year for another try...poor thing, she was trying. I knew that since I had pre-paid for the room we couldn't get anything back so I didn't even ask. Mainly all you want back is your time, not money, anyway, but I knew she couldn't do anything about that. It just left us with a sour taste in our mouths, I guess. All staff we encountered were very helpful and courteous. They did replace the bulb over the toilet, too. As time passes the irritation fades. Great location for 56 year olds who need to do the sightseeing in little spurts thru the day. Good place for popping back in the room to drop off stuff, rest, etc."
207,1862,"Feb 2 2006	Awful	We checked in on 12/23/05 for 3 nights. The gentleman who checked us in had the personality of a stone, no greeting whatsoever! We paid additional for a park view room and requested a room on a higher floor. Upon entering our room after using the toilet, it would not stop running. After contacting front desk and waiting 30 minutes for engineering, I went down to the front desk. The only other room in the entire hotel with a park view was on the 3rd floor! Upset but needing to unpack due to theatre tickets, I checked out the room. The toilet was running in this room as I unlocked the door! Back to the front desk, now they only had a smoking room.2 hours after &quot;checking in&quot; we finally got to speak with Hector in engineering, he promised to take care of us after he was given a $$ tip. We ended up with a room on the 16th floor. The room was very small and the bathroom could have been alot cleaner. Not once during our stay did we come across a friendly employee, stone cold looks!In addition, we never received any sort of apology."
208,1862,"Jan 29 2006	OK experience	The good things about this hotel are the fabulous location right on Central Park South and the polite and helpful staff. Our room #411 overlooked the park and our rate was $310 which I think is a great price for the view and location. However, being on only the fourth floor the noise from the street was a bit loud - we had to have the window cracked because our non-smoking room smelled like smoke and was roasting hot. And the bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. The rooms need some serious updating with old small TV's and stained furniture. Maybe that will happen now that there is new management. So overall it was just OK and I would probably not stay there again. For about the same price the Parker Meridian around the corner is better."
209,1862,"Jan 25 2006	Just sold to Jumeriah - renovations planned	Thjis is a very nice hotel although not at all your typicaly Westin, which perhaps explains why it was just sold to the Jumeriah chain of luxury hotels. Ownership changed hands the weekend of 1/15/2006, and apparently they will be investing in a full renovation. The transition was handled with amazing skill - no service disruptions of any kind and we were even invited to a reception celebrating the new ownership in the lobby the night they took over.The hotel is lovely and in a terrific location on Central Park South. It has some very nice art deco detailing in the lobby and elevators. The rooms are good sized for New York and contain classic furnishing. Some are in need of new upholsetery or paint, but overall the experience is still very good. I have stayed in a single room before, but this time was upgraded to a suite on the 17th floor which was spacious and well appointed.I think the new ownership is likely to mean good things for this wonderful hotel as it gets a facelift. Those considering a visit in the next few months may want to check on renovations plans as that could cause some short-term disruptions."
210,1862,"Jan 22 2006	It's all about service	We stayed in an interior room ($379) before xmas and departed on the first day of the transit strike. My daughter and I were late getting into the city on Saturday eve. and had to get to our reservations at Red Eye Grill (ok food). A bellman offered to take our bags to our room for us and call ahead to the restaurant so we wouldn't be late. When we returned, a few hrs. later, our bags were not in the room and we had to hunt them down via/front desk/housekeeping. Needless to say, we were upset since we had tipped handsomely for this service. We got our bags within a reasonable time, but then realized one smaller one was still missing! That, too, was resolved but we did learn that this is not accepted hotel policy. The room itself could have been cleaned better; we found a man's belt and trash under the bed. A quick visit to the night concierge (Nicki) made all the difference and is why the Westin continues to stand out for service. She insisted on improving our experience and offered to have a dessert of our choice sent to the room as well as giving us complimentary breakfst buffet coupons for our next two days. The Botanicals Restaurant breakfast buffet is fabulous! Also, the location is wonderful and worked to our advantage during the beginning of the strike. We were nervous that we wouldn't get to LaGuardia in time. Never fear, the great bellstaff helped us into a lincoln towncar that was plush and a more reasonable price than our taxi coming in. Again, its all about the wonderful service that a Westin property has to offer. Granted, our room was nowhere near the size and interior beauty of the Westin St. Louis, but location and service during the xmas holidays was tops."
211,1862,"Jan 16 2006	You can't beat the location! One of Midtown's best	We've always stayed at the Essex House when in Manhattan primarily due to the excellent location and the fact it was a Starwood Property. Unfortunately, this will be our last visit there since they are leaving the Starwood Group (Westin). We use Starwood Points to get a free stay (our last one was 10 nights - 12/23/05 to 1/2/06!) We've always received some sort of upgrade (which you won't get if you don't ask). Last visit we were put on the 37th floor on the St. Regis Club level. The room was bigger than a regular Essex House room. The amenities were Acqua Parma which are a cut above. This is an old hotel so the plumbing drains slowly. The bathroom and room were clean. However, Westin's housekeeping department needs work. They kept taking our wash (face) cloths after repeated requests not to. Oh well, a small annoyance.The restaurants were a little pricey for my budget. We found some excellent ones nearby (Angelo's Pizza, Nino's Tuscany, Fontana Dei Trevi, Europa Cafe, Carnegie Deli).I found out that some Middle Eastern conglomerate has purchased the Hotel and will be doing a several hundred million dollar renovation! If these folks treat this place like hotels in Dubai, it will truly be THE place to stay in New York! While renovating, it will be not too nice. Word to the wise - ask about renovations before booking."
212,1862,"Jan 13 2006 	This was the perfect place to stay.	The Essex House scored high on two scales: location and comfort. Since Central Park and the nearby museums were such an important feature of my vacation, being able to step out the doors of the hotel and cross the street into the magnificent park was a huge treat for me. The Essex House is very comfortably within walking distance of the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Natural History, and the great shops on Fifth Avenue. Maybe it's just a little too close to Fifth Avenue.My room was comfy but not stuffy (although, because I stayed on a lower floor with an 'Inner View', I was treated to all the middle of the night noises that make New York special: cars, trucks, sirens). The Westin chain's sumptuous 'Heavenly Bed' really is a treat for a bad back like mine and it helps restore the body after days of walking (the reason most Manhattanites seem to be very fit). My room was satisfyingly clean and well appointed. The 'Heavenly Bath' - consisting of a two-headed massage shower head, crescent curtain (for more elbow room), marble floor and sink surround, and luxury amenities - was compact but easy to move around in. My only complaint about the room would be that it seemed to be slightly dilapidated; in the bathroom, wallpaper was loose in several places and hanging from the wall in a strip - and, despite my mentioning this a member of the housekeeping staff, no effort was made to correct it. I later learned that the entire hotel is slated for renovation this year, so that may explain its having 'slipped' a little in the maintenance department. However, guests should not have to bear any burden because of this. We pay for immediate comfort, not future improvement. The wallpaper should have been fixed.I did not have the opportunity to dine in one of the hotel's fine restaurants (which I regret), but dining in my room was an enjoyable experience. The room service staff were accommodating and pleasant. The Journeys lounge was a cosy, lovely environment for hanging out with friends over a drink and a delightful snack.Without exception, the hotel staff were efficient, respectful and pleasant.I'm not sure what's in the future for the Essex, since it was acquired by the Dubai Jumeira group and will cease to be a Westin hotel this year. Since the Jumeira group has announced that they will continue to operate it as a hotel (albeit with fewer rooms), I believe that it will continue to be an even lovelier experience for visitors to the city. My only selfish concern is that, after the proposed renovation and management transition, it may be much pricier.Overall, a delightful experience, and one I'd love to repeat."
213,1862,"Jan 12 2006	Great Location Good Looking Hotel	Brilliantly located for Mid/Up Town. We started in a lousy back room but got moved to the front of the hotel overlooking Central Park - this made all the difference. Beautiful view to wake up to, even though there was a little traffic noise, but the room was comfortable and to see the Park and soaring buildings surrounding it made up for everything. Staff were a bit curt on the front desks but everyone else was charming. Made a lovely break."
214,1862,"Dec 21 2005	Not bad	Had a pleasant enough stay here considering I booked the cheapest rate they had (still over $400 but for NYC in Decemeber that is what it costs for any decent hotel)I put a premium on space and the Essex House scores big there. Bathroom was a decent size but missed the mark on luxurious. The Heavenly Beds are the centerpiece.Service was ok, not bad, not great. Could see how the front desk could easily get overwhelmed and my calls to the operator / front desk did go unanswered twice. Overall, this was a fine stay, but I will probably look somewhere else next time."
215,1862,"Dec 21 2005	Will keep coming back!	The Essex House has become our home away from home in NYC. It's grand but not overwhelming, gracious without snobbery, and luxurious, comfortable and livable at the same time. The price is right most of the time, with park view rooms hovering between $280 and $380 per night. We stayed in all three types of park view rooms, the superior queen (small and cozy), the deluxe king (wide and spacious), and the suite (the size of an apartment). Black marble bathrooms are all the same size, with the Westin Heavenly bath and shower. Here's a tip I don't think anyone else has mentioned: don't order room service. Instead, ask the concierge for recommendations for very good local delivery places. My concierge pointed me to two amazing delivery eateries: the redeye grill, for american fusion seafood cuisine, and rue 57 for french/japanese food and amazing sushi, all of which I viewed the menus for online. We've already got our park view reservations for spring 2006!"
216,1862,"Nov 28 2005	Nice getway	Had a romantic, weekend-getaway in NYC. Room was very clean, comfortable, typically NYC small (but not cramped). Our room had a 6th-floor (treetop-level) view of Central Park. Lots of street action outside... tour buses, horse-drawn carriages, joggers, some honking horns, (but that's the city!). Great location near the remodeled Colombus Circle, lots of local restaurants, walk to Lincoln Center (6 blocks) and Rockefeller Center. The room was pricey, but you're paying for location. Only cons were the spa (small, no whirlpool, had sauna and steam) and no in-room safe; exercise facility was adequate. Staff and service were great."
217,1862,"Nov 28 2005	Great time at the Essex House	I had a wonderful time at the Essex House over the Thanksgiving holiday with my family. Our room was a nice size for a NY hotel, and was attractively furnished, very comfortable and clean. Although we had only one sink in the bathroom it was generously sized, clean and attractive- all marble and with the signature &quot;heavenly shower.&quot; We booked the least expensive double bed room and so had an interior view. We loved the location right across from the park and convenient for shows and museums. We were able to walk everywhere. We enjoyed a drink in their cozy bar with couches and a fireplace, but we did not try any of their restaurants. We found plenty of easy and inexpensive places for breakfast right outside the hotel- try pick a bagel for coffee and bagels or Brooklyn Diner for a delicious and reasonable breakfast. The employees we dealt with were always friendly. We would definitely stay here again."
218,1862,"Nov 20 2005	An interesting Westin	Why Westin puts its name on the Essex House remains a mystery to me. It was just so different from your typical Westin. And given the capital Starwood spends on developing its brands, this inconsistency seems rather strange.Unlike the typical Westin, which features contemporary facility and down-to-earth service, Essex House is all about the old New York. In many ways, it reminded me of the Waldorf. The lobby was decorated in a conservative/traditional style, but it lacked the grandeur and scale of the Waldorf or even the run-down Plaza. The room I got was on the small side, and the &quot;Heavenly&quot; amenities were nothing special. Service was quite poor - snobbish staff without the class to back it up.What really bothered me was the fact that this hotel was neither grand nor intimate. The Carlyle and the Mark are small, but they leverage on their size to offer personalized service that creates a home-away-from-home for their guests. The Waldorf and the Plaza go the opposite by impressing you with their grand public spaces. They are all clear about their strengths and weaknesses, and they position themselves accordingly.In this case, the Essex House took the worst of both worlds - impersonal service and unimpressive public spaces. Is this a bad hotel? Absolutely not. But for the rate I paid, I expected much more."
219,1862,"Oct 27 2005 	Hated to leave!	We stayed at the Essex October 11 through the 21st. Upon arrival we requested a king room with a park view instead of the queen/park view room we had reserved and were told nothing was available. Our queen room on the 9th floor was impossibly small so we called to say we needed a larger room. Our bellman got on the phone and suddenly a king room, park view on the 5th floor was available. We weren't crazy about being on the 5th floor as we had requested an upper floor, but the king room was so much nicer than the queen that we stayed put. On our third night we seemed to have a smoker on our non-smoking floor. This person smoked late into the night. We never complained but others on the floor did since we saw security sniffing at everyones doors. Finally on the sixth day we asked to be moved since the smoker could not be aprehended and he didn't seem to be leaving. We were immediately given a king/park view on the 11th floor which had a much nicer view and less traffic noise.Other than having to switch rooms everything else was wonderful. To a person the staff was friendly and excellent. The bar downstairs is cosy and a pleasure to have a drink before going to our room. The carpets in the room could use a cleaning but otherwise everything was great. My one complaint is the lack of a coffee maker in the room and the extremely expensive room service menu.I would gladly stay here anytime. Just be sure to pay for a park view and a king room."
220,1862,"Oct 21 2005	Magic CAN happen!	I spent five nights at this hotel in mid October. I originally chose it because of its proximity to Central Park and I was not prepared for how wonderful the experience was. Because my plane from California landed at JFK at 6AM I couldn't get checked into my room until noon but the helpful girl at the reception desk told me I could leave my luggage there (safely), go to the park or wherever, come back at noon, and go through the check-in process. This worked perfectly. I had made my reservation by phone in April and had requested a high floor on the park side. I was, in no way, prepared for the view: three huge and sparkling clean windows overlooking the park. I could see all the way to the Bronx. It had been raining for a week and the park sparkled. The city lights sparkled at night. The sight was amazing and worth every penny that I paid for that room.Not everything, however, was as perfect as that view, but the things I had problems with were very minor and very fixable. Housekeeping had left no washcloths one morning. One request brought some and they appeared ever after. The toilet seat was one of those flimsily attached by flexible plastic and it wiggled all over. The toilet had a habit of running but after handle jiggling, it stopped. The water pressure, even as high up as I was, was fantastic...in the sink and in the shower. The shower was excellent, once I figured out the controls. It would have been helpful to have had a primer on the operation because it was rather unique. The bed, as has been previously mentioned, was soft and cushy and clean. The carpet had a few stains but so what. Designer water available for $5.00 but nobody said you have to buy it. Tap water was fine! Lighting...lots of it and plenty of watts. Roominess in the room? A desk, a loveseat, an easy chair, a monster size bed, a chest of drawers with top space for luggage, two huge closets, a big TV, an end table by the bed, a table by the chair, three phones (I'm sure I've forgotten something), and still lots of space. Of all the positive things about the Essex the best of all was the human element. To a man, and woman, ALL staff was professional, professionally dressed, friendly, helpful, and cheerful. The gentlemen out on the sidewalk could get a cab in a jiffy and didn't mind arguing with drivers and calling security on drivers they thought might be trying to stiff the hotel guests. I witnessed one such exchange. Oh, the power of those Essex doormen! They were terrific. Would I go back? In a New York minute. Thank you, Essex House. I miss you already. My own bed and shower and view seem very, very lame. I almost forgot...because the hotel's check out time is noon, and because my plane didn't leave Kennedy until 7PM, once again the hotel allowed me to keep it as my base of operations (they stored my luggage and allowed me to use the &quot;facilities&quot; when I wasn't in the park and finally, their super doormen hailed one last cab for me and got my luggage safely stored in the trunk of the cab). Boy, did I hate to leave. I had the feeling there that I was being well taken care of and completely safe. I think a tourist or traveler would be wise to stay at the Essex House. I am sitting here in sunny Southern California thinking about what the first snowfall would look like from those windows. California dreaming is turning into New York City dreaming."
221,1862,"Oct 18 2005	Not bad!	My husband and I stayed here for two nights on October 12 &amp; 13 and the hotel was pretty good. We had a nice, clean, comfortable room that faced the street behind. The bed was super comfy, the double showerheads different and I have no complaints. Everything is nearby or within walking distance or a quick subway ride. I just wished it didn't rain the entire time we were there."
222,1862,Sep 19 2005	Oasis of peace and quiet	The Essex is an oasis of peace and charm in this very busy and noisy city.Our room which was a deluxe with park view was excellent and very clean. My wife and I found all the staff to be very helpful except - the ones behind the concierge desk who are full of their own self importance which consequently makes them very unhelpful.That aside I would definately return .
223,1862,"Sep 9 2005	Fine Stay!	Stayed 8/31 - 9/6 and enjoyed our time there. Front desk staff was very friendly and assisted with a complicated reservation (2 rooms, using Starpoints for part of the stay). Our 8th floor Queen room had a lovely view of Central Park. As expected, it was New York small but clean and comfortable (the Westin Beds can't be beat!) Didn't eat at the restaurants but the location is perfect for strolling anywhere in Manhattan. I would stay there again."
224,1862,"Aug 31 2005	A Great Stay at the Essex	Outstanding hotel. The bed was very confortable, the room was quiet, the shower was wonderful. The staff was attentive, friendly and helpful. I have chuckled over the complaints about the small rooms...what are people expecting in an older, historic hotel in the middle of NYC??? I thought the room was plenty big enough and was very comfortable. The restaurants associated with the hotel are very expensive, but there are great bagel/ breakfast places within a block or two. I would stay here again."
225,1862,"Aug 30 2005	horrible night at the essex house	horrible room called to get moved - even offered to pay more and they never even called back. bad service in the restaurant. there are so many better hotels we have stayed in - trump international, the peninsula, the rhiga royal, omni - very sorry we wasted a night at the essex"
226,1862,"Aug 28 2005	A week at the Essex House	Nine of us travelled from Aberdeen, Scotland to stay at the Essex House for one week on 28th July 2005. Two of our group got married in Central Park during our stay.We were originally booked to stay at the Plaza but our reservations were changed to the Essex House after the Plaza closed down. We had expected a totally luxurious hotel for the money we paid and some of our party were disappointed by the Essex. I am not sure if we could have had a more luxurious hotel for the money we paid or if the standard we received was correct by New York standards.Many of our group were disappointed by their rooms. My husband and I however were not. Out of the 5 rooms our group occupied ours was the largest, a very good size. The heavenly bed and heavenly shower were both fantastic! The bed was huge and the shower had a double head - bliss!We did not eat in the hotel during our stay as it was extremely expensive but after talking to guests who did I can say the food was of a very high standard. The hotel bar was also very expensive so we tended not to spend too much time there either. But I am sure this is the case in any large hotel in any city world wide.We found all of the hotel staff to be extremely polite and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them.The lobby area and Journeys Bar were all decorated and maintained to a very high standard.The location of the hotel itself was ideal, directly opposite Central Park, and about twenty minutes walk from Times Square down Broadway. We spent a few late afternoons/early evenings chilling out in the Sheep Meadow in Central Park and found it a lovely way to relax after a busy day shopping or sightseeing.I thouroughly enjoyed my stay at The Essex House but was left wondering if it really was value for money."
227,1862,"Aug 25 2005	No Customer Service Here	After living in Manhattan for a year, I took my father back with me for an annual visit to New York. I booked a room at the Westin Essex House with two double beds and a view of the park to treat my father to a classic New York experience. After confirming the room (twice), I was given a standard room with no view of the park and apparently no access by staff. We were forgotten continually -- our luggage was left in the lobby, no morning newspaper delivery, no shoe shine, a missed cleaning, a 10 hour response time from the Concierge for dinner reservations, and not even a call back from the manager in response to our appeal for help! I certainly feel for the other reviewers who witnessed bad service here and I wholeheartedly agree. There are much &quot;nicer&quot; places to stay in Manhattan, skip the Westin, Essex House!"
228,1862,Aug 15 2005	Great 6 Nights	Staying at the Essex House this past July 2005 with my husband and college bound daughter was a pleasure. Our large room with living area and convertable sofa was just the right amount of space for us not to feel crowded together for so many days. Our hotel room became a soothing retreat from the hustle and bustle of college tours. The bathroom was spacious and constantly serviced with enough towels for each of us. The &quot;heavenly&quot; bed was just as advertised....heavenly. Their lovely restaurants and great bar helped create a wonderful ambience for this full service wonderful hotel. We look forward to another stay in the near future.
229,1862,"Aug 1 2005	Not worth the price	The staff was nice and the location across Central Park was great but that was about it. The room we had was the tiniest room Ive ever stayed in for the price we paid; the queen bed took most of the space. There was no coffee maker in the room which meant I had to run downstairs, after rolling out of bed, and buy coffee for $2.00 a cup in the gift shop every morning. Bottled water offered in the room as 5.00 a piece! For what we paid that should have been free. There was hardly any drawer space for our clothes: the space under the TV was taken up by the mini bar and one of the dressers next to the bed had the safe in it. All of the furniture looked like it had seen better days based on its wear and tear. The breakfast bar was absolutely terrible (greasy bacon, runny eggs, bone dry fried potatoes) and on top of that it was $27 a person. Oh, by the way, a glass of juice to go along with that breakfast bar was $6.50. The elevators are the worst. There are 8 but they were so small hardly anyone could fit in. Wet generally had to let several elevators pass before being able to get on."
230,1862,"Jul 20 2005	Fantastic!	First, the location is amazing. Only a few turns from the Tunnel, so getting lost was not possible (and this coming from a woman who gets lost going to the mailbox).It was located right on the edge of central Park, on the south end. The hotel is situated directly across the street, and our room had a wonderful view of the Park.The foyer of the hotel was amazing (BTW, this word will be used over and over here!). It was all marble and mahogany and each area, check in/out, bellhop, concieagre etc. were all well seperated so you were not waiting in line for 12 people in front of you doing something besides checking in.There is Valet parking at the hotel, which runs 45.00 for every 24 hours. this, I think, runs about the same if you were to park your car in a garge and paid the hourly charge. If you are NY suavy, you could prob. find a garge a little ways away, pay less, and take the bus or cab to hotel.moving on, each floor seemed to carry a different theme, which wall to wall murals. very well done and very beautiful. there were 6 elevators, and you need to press the floor buttons as soon as you get in, or you get taken to a floor someone else called on.The room - Amazing! it had a queen bed with the most INCREDIBLE bedding. Soft, cool, crisp - a perfect nights sleep. the pillows too - wonderful! there was a full TV cabinet with the standard tv etc. but also a built in Nintendo system. very cool. oh, and in addition to regular TV, it had a few HBOs I think.The bathroom was average, and if I am not mistaken, every bathroom had a phone. Not sure who you would talk to while on the john, but to each thier own. The shower head was a double headed multi-speed and pressure thingie. the towels, like the bedding, were heavenly!there was a large closet, 2 nightstands, a chair and side table and like I said earlier, a great view of Central Park (although we were only just above tree level, on the 4th floor).Service - Good. We only requested one item while there, a lint brush, which took about 30 minutes to get to us. a little long considering we were on the way to the theater, but still managed to get there. They also have a whole list of &quot;guest ammenities&quot; that can be asked for like toothpaste, hairbrush, deoderant etc. if you forget to bring something. The prices on the hotel dining and room-service was WAY expensive. a continental breakfast was about 18.00 per person. we spend less at the diner up the street for a full on breaskfast.the staff were amazing. The good thing I loved was that the staff asked to see a room key before getting onto the elevator, which I am sure helps with people sneaking in, causing trouble etc. also, check out time in noon, which is nice, and since we were leaving on a Sunday, we asked if they could hold our car and luggages so we could catch a yankees game. It was done without hassle! Fantastic!things to do - the Hard Rock Cafe NY was right up the street, about 2 blocks. Fantastic! On a friday night, at 9pm, we got in and didnt have to wait to be seated. and of course, the regular touristy things are good too. Cabs are great and very useful. Time Square is only about 6 or 7 blocks away, and it is ALWAYS crowded. Even at 2 am. Trust me, I know.okay, so thats about it. I hope I covered everything. if not, ask away. It was a great hotel, great service and great staff. I would Def. stay there again!OH! and if your lucky, maybe you'll meet someone famous. We did! Nicole Kidman was staying at this hotel for a press junket (we are assuming) and we exchaged pleasentries waiting for the elevator. You never know who you will run into!"
231,1862,"Jun 27 2005	Would not recommend!	The room was very small; the photos on the websites are very misleading. The carpets were stained; the TV was tiny and for the money was total disappointing. After spending nearly $400.00 for a park view queen room, I had to pay $5.00 for a bottle of water that is in the room...what an insult! I have stayed in other hotels in the city for much less and have gotten so much more..."
232,1862,"Jun 3 2005 	Nice hotel but the staffs bad attitude ruins the stay	I have not stayed at the Essex House in a year or two. I used to stay there 5-6x a year because of the location. I finaly got fed up with the horrible staff memebers and their bad attitudes. This goes all the way up to some of the assist. managers. Now I am back in NY and decided to give the Essex another try...bad move. My room was a smoking room and when I called down to see about getting another room you would have thought I was asking for something outragous. I quote &quot;why don't you just stay there and see how bad it is&quot;, &quot;are you sure you want to switch, you will have to come down and get another key&quot; and the best one &quot;sir, we do have the right to refuse service to anyone and we have done it in the past.&quot; All for a non-smoking room. Anyway I got over it until I made the mistake of calling down and asking for some extra towels ( i was only given one). the service express woman says &quot;sir this isn't the sheraton we don't just give away our towels.&quot; That ws it, never again....nice hotel but the staff is the worst in NY."
233,1862,"Jun 2 2005 	Good location for Midtown business	Stayed here for business. Walking distance to many midtown locations (for business). Was a Starwood Preferred member with some bonus (I can't remember all the names) and upgraded to a suite. It was very nice but the rooms still have their &quot;old world&quot; feel to them. Bed was VERY comfortable and shower was very neat. Very clean as well. They did charge me for items in the mini bar but I never even opened it and they quickly rectified that without any further discussion. If I wasn't here on business, I probably wouldn't pay as much but then again, it is NYC."
234,1862,"May 31 2005	Enjoyed my stay!! Would recommend!	My husband and I stayed at this hotel last week from 5/24 to 5/26 for 2 nights. We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it! We booked on Priceline and got a rate of $200 a night which is great for this type of hotel.Highlights- Hotel has a GREAT location! It is in midtown Manhattan and it is central to all tourist attractions and you can get anywhere using the subway which is really close by.- I loved the Heavenly shower with the two heads. It really is heavenly! My husband liked the Heavenly bed.- The staff were really helpful. The conceirge was able to answer all our questions and help us with maps we needed and the front desk was great. The hotel was pretty full that week, but they tried to upgrade us and when they did, the room turned out to be noisy (view of park from third floor), so they moved us to a higher floor.Lowlights- No free internet access.- The rooms are a bit small, but it is New York City.- Bring earplugs if you are facing the park and are on a lower floor. We ended up on a higher floor facing another building, but that was fine with us and it wasn't that noisy."
235,1862,"May 25 2005	Loved this hotel	I loved this hotel. I just got back from a New York stay at two different hotels. I have stayed at many hotels in New York and I feel that this was a really great one. The staff was friendly and went above and beyond from start to finish. Arrived at 10:00 a.m. and had no problem checking in right away, as opposed to the Paramount, where I spent the second week. Was greeted by Bob, the doorman. He told me his name and if I needed anything at all during my stay to let him know. The room was great. Yes, I had a view of another building, but that wasn't what I came to the city for. I was out most of the time. The room was spacious, especially for New York. Very clean. Well maintained. The heavenly bed was indeed heavenly. In fact, it was so comfortable, that I found myself having a hard time getting up the first two days that I was there. I had been working mega-hours before my trip to NY, so the heavenly bed sucked me in. The bathroom was large and the shower was excellent. The location at the park was superb. I was close enough to Times Square to easily get there, but far enough away to not have to walk in wall to wall people all of the time. Very convenient to the subway at Columbus circle, buses, etc. Very near Fifth Ave, Central Park, Carnegie Hall, Times Square, etc. The lobby was beautiful and the staff was first rate. I paid 149-169 per night on Priceline. What a steal. I ended up arriving a day earlier than when I had originally booked priceline and had to add a room on my own. I had to pay 269.00. I love Priceline! Without it, I probably would not have ever stayed at this hotel."
236,1862,"May 12 2005	Ignore the bad reviews!	Just back from 4 nights at the Essex Park, where myself, my husband and both our sets of parents stayed to celebrate a number of special occasions. Where to start...All staff were incredibly helpful, polite, thoughtful and efficient. Our check in clerk upgraded my husband and I to a park-view room as soon as my husband cheekily mentioned that it was our wedding anniversary. The bell man came across the road to greet us, carry our bags and to argue with our limo driver (who had dropped us off across 4 lanes of traffic away from the hotel!). Our room was gorgeous - the view was only an added bonus. The room was plenty big enough, the bed - can't describe how comfortable - shower was great, it was clean and really comfortable.The two sets of parents didn't get park-views, but GIANT rooms, with equally GIANT king beds (the queen we had seemed to be the same as a king here, the king bed was the same as two double beds pushed together!) and also incredibly comfortable (you definitely need a good nights sleep after all the walking we did!).We ate breakfast in the hotel on the first morning for a treat, and although rather pricey, was delicious and worth every penny (there's a great place around the corner - the Parisienne - which does a more reasonable and 'real NY' breakfast).We ordered hot drinks from room service that were so fast and so hot, delivered with flowers and a flourish - the waiter was incredibly polite, insisting on tidying up our (very messy!) console table in order that he could safely place the hot drinks down.Reception were more than happy to change my mum's trillions of travellers cheques (don't know if you've been before, but New York is NOT the place to take travellers cheques - stores seem to hate them) at all hours of the day and night and the staff were always cheerful and always told us what the weather was planning to do.We got this hotel for a bargain through Priceline and as far as we were concerned, the hotel was robbed! After reading the reviews on here before we went, I was really worried (this trip had all been arranged by me!), but I really think that Americans must be a little more picky than the British - this hotel is just great to stay in, right on the park, right near the subway and near great shops on 5th Avenue etc... We were not once disrupted by cleaners (or lack of cleaning) and no one was rude to us. I did witness one lady yelling at many different hotel staff, and can only conclude that you get what you give - we were very polite and the staff treated us with equal respect. Perhaps if you go around giving out bad vibes, bad things happen to you!Definitely would recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
237,1862,"Apr 20 2005	Superb In Every Way	I took my 8-year-old son on a father-son bonding trip to New York last week. I struggled with where to stay; I like to avoid midtown, but felt like for his first trip we should stay in a more touristy area. I finally settled on the Essex House and am glad I did!I had used Starwood points to get a really great rate, but that meant we were destined for a brick wall view. I asked if there was any way we could swing a park view, and the desk clerk cheerfully upgraded us to a spacious (at least by NYC standards) room facing Central Park. The location was great; we walked nearly everywhere, and my son loved going to the park every day to play and climb rocks. The staff was incredibly gracious, the food was excellent and they really went all out for room service, with fresh flowers on linens on the table that was left in the room (even when all I had ordered was a bowl of soup!) Everyone treated my son like royalty, which I really appreciated. As usual, the &quot;Heavenly&quot; bed and shower were great. The concierge was helpful and friendly. And I was able to secure a 3:00 p.m. checkout time, which with our plans for our final day really helped us.Top to bottom, just a stellar experience."
238,1862,"Apr 20 2005	Worst Hotel ever - do not waste your money there.......	My partner and I decided to stay at this &quot;top&quot; hotel from April 7th through to the 11th, as it was my birthday on the 8th April. The first evening we got there, I noticed that our toilet was starting to fill up and I thought it would overflow and spill out all over the bathroom floor. I reported this at reception at 5pm and we assumed it would be fixed, while we were out for the evening. We returned at 11pm and no one had been all that time! I went down to reception and complained and they apologised but confirmed that no one had been in. They said it must have been a &quot;break down in communications&quot;. We then had to move rooms at 11.45pm that evening (so repack our bags and cases) and were given two breakfast vouchers by way of compensation.The rest of the holiday seemed fine, but as soon as I got back to London I was told that my brother had organised 35 pounds worth of flowers, to be sent to me at the hotel for the morning of my birthday (April 8th). They NEVER ARRIVED. The receptionist confirmed that I was a guest there, when the driver dropped the flowers off and assured him they would be delivered. WHERE DID THEY GO? I have also found out that two friends called me from London on my birthday - I didnt get any messages, and remember checking my voicemail twice that day (as you would on your birthday!) I have contacted the hotel - who are looking into it all. That was last week and STILL no reply or call from them - 5 working days later. DO NOT STAY at this hotel -- its the worsty 5 star hotel I have stayed in and they ruined my birthday weekend."
239,1862,"Mar 20 2005	Perfection at the Essex House	I planned a first trip to the big city for my niece's 16th birthday. Our trip coincided with &quot;The Gates&quot; installation at Central Park. For this reason I booked a park-view room at the Essex House in September of 2004 at a price of $289 per night. Luckily I did book that early because as the buzz of the Christo work spread park-view rooms quickly became scarce. I was worried that perhaps we would be given an inferior room because I was not a frequent customer and had no Starwood points. I did sign up for the Starwood program before our trip. Our flight departed early in the morning and we got to the Essex House at 10am, thinking we would have to deposit our luggage and come back at check-in time. To my surprise we were escorted immediately to our room. Check-in was quick, efficient and extremely courteous and the view from our 10th floor room was perfect. We had a picture-perfect view of the Gates and all of Central Park. The bed was huge and inviting, triple sheeted, a down duvet and lots of pillows. The bathroom, although not extremely large was marble and had a great two-headed shower, a phone by the toilet and a lighted make-up mirror mounted by the sink. The only bad thing I could say was that there was no counter space in the bathroom. We requested something to be brought up to the room and when the waiter arrived he rang our DOORBELL. My niece was especially impressed with that. We had a delicious three course prix fixe lunch for $25 a person at the downstairs Cafe Botanica. It has windows facing Central Park South. Service here was impeccable as well.Our stay could not have been more perfect at the Westin Essex House. Highly recommended!If you wish to see photos of our trip: (---)"
240,1862,"Mar 12 2005	Not a great experience	My family travels into New York City an average of 2 weekends per month. We normally stay at the Hilton or Westin Times Square, as these are the most reliable hotels in terms of customer service and accommodations. We received an email offer for $199 at the Westin Times Square and decided to take advantage of this great rate. There were no rooms available at the Westin, but the offer was extended to the Essex House Westin on Central Park South. Being a native New Yorker, I grew up thinking of the Essex House as a very elegant hotel where celebrities stay. The lobby is reminiscent of 1930s grand style  classy and elegant. There was no wait at check in. When I booked the room, I explained that I needed one that was big enough for 3 people. I was told that the Deluxe Queen Park View room would be large enough to accommodate a roll away bed. Upon check in, I was told that was true- if we wanted to crawl over each other to get to the bathroom. The front desk clerk offered a king room with a partial park view (one small window that looks over the park  the other window looking directly into other hotel windows. I explained that we were celebrating my sons birthday and we really wanted what we booked  a nice park view. I knew they had suites available (I had just checked with reservations out of curiosity) and I asked to be upgraded (I am, after all a Starwood Preferred Guest). The clerk said he could not upgrade us as all the suites were spoken for. The room is on the small size with a little area that held the desk and closets. The bathroom was very small. You had to shut the door completely to get to the toilet.As other reviews stated, the windows are very drafty and you need to keep the drapes closed or you will freeze. The temperature control in the room was quirky. It was too hot or too cold, never perfect. The carpets were stained, giving the room a dingy appearance. They offer satellite TV, which is nice because you get a few more kids channels than most hotels offering cable.The heavenly bed that the Westin is famous for is just that. The bed, pillows and comforters were magnificent. We all slept like babies.Our second day started with a very pricy ($61 for 2 adults and a child) but elegant buffet breakfast in the lobby restaurant. The eggs were a bit runny but other than that it was lovely.Housekeeping was another issue. They only made the bed. They did not refresh our towels, make up the rollaway or do any other maintenance in the room. We returned to the room at about 2:30 to see linens in the corner of the room, the rollaway stripped but not done up and no clean towels. A few minutes later, a housekeeper barged into the room without knocking. She backed out of the room embarrassed and never returned. I went to the front desk to complain and was assured that the problem would be fixed immediately. I also requested a refrigerator, which never arrived. We left and returned nearly an hour later and nothing had been done. It was time to get management involved.The manager was pleasant enough and said it was not the Essex Houses policy to have rooms half serviced, nor was it their policy for housekeeping to barge in without knocking. When I addressed the issue of the refrigerator, she told me to take everything out of the minibar and use that. I told her I was uncomfortable with that but she insisted that it was ok to do. I think its poor form to ask a guest to assume the responsibility of emptying the miniibar and making sure everything gets back in. She said she would send up a fridge if I insisted. Finally, housekeeping arrived (again entering the room without knocking) to bring towels. The manager offered to upgrade us next time we come into the city. If I were going to pay top dollar, Id rather book a room at the Hiltons Executive floor or the Westin Times Square. If you need to be on Central Park South, Im sure there are better choices."
241,1862,"Mar 9 2005 	Enjoyed the Essex House	Spent four nights at the Essex House in February 2005. For the price I thought it was one of better values I have found in NYC. Room was fairly big by New York standards, clean and comfortable. I would certainly return."
242,1862,"Mar 4 2005	Great location very nice room but??	My husband and I stayed here Feb 24-26, and picked the location to be close to &quot;The Gates&quot; in Central Park. As Starwood &quot;gold&quot; status, we wereupgraded to a room on the 25th floor (2505) where there is &quot;butler&quot; service.While the &quot;butler&quot;, who came to the room shortly after we arrived was veryprofessional, she never appeared when we paged her a few hours later.We had a room with 2 queen beds, and a view facing NW, with a partial view over Central Park. The &quot;heavenly&quot; beds are indeed quite good, the linens very high-end, and the furniture and ambiance overall quite nice.The bathroom was huge, and gratis toiletries wonderful, as well as the large box of truffles provided upon arrival.Only problem was, as cited by other guests on tripadvisor, the drafts coming in from the windows. The very heavy (and lovely) draperies kept the drafts out when closed, but when opened it was somewhat cold in the room. At about $350 night, (no breakfast), we felt it was a fair price for the overallquality at a hotel in NYC. We had stayed at the Warwick the month before for $250/night, and the difference between the two hotels is much more than the price differential we experienced.This is definitely a &quot;get what you pay for&quot; place.. I suspect that you're not going to be happy getting with a $200 room here through hotels or expedia."
243,1862,"Feb 8 2005	Try something else next time	Just came back from NYC(02/06/05). Stayed 2 nights at essex house for about 245 per night for 10th floor deluxe room with park view. Outside of building looks very run down. Lobby is very plain. Check in was great, very friendly and fast. Got 2 'pink' coupons for breakfast at botanicas restaurant. 'pink coupons' lets you eat buffet plus menu items at no charge. Breakfast is fantastic. Room was spacious and nice view of the park but higher floor would have been nice. Marble bathroom was on the small side with no where to put your things but was very clean. Bed is nice but at the end of the day it's just a bed. Concierge at night was very nice and recommended ' la vineria ' italian restaurant just a couple of blocks away. It was great. Tried the same thing with the concierge during the day and she ------. Total attitude. Don't think will stay there again since you don't get what you paid for. There are Holiday Inns that are just as nice. Would like to try the W or the Westin Hotel in time square next time. Bye,"
244,1862,"Jan 23 2005	Great experience at a corporate hotel	Checked in for two nights on January 14th and were given the room we had booked -- queen bed with Central Park view -- on the 5th floor. Sure, the room was small for what one would expect, but in NYC as it is in Europe, space is a premium. We heard some street noise, but were not bothered by the occasional horn honk or the clopping of horse hooves as the carriages strolled by. Isn't that part of the charm of staying off Central Park? The &quot;Heavenly&quot; bed was quite comfortable and the white linens crisp and luxurious. The &quot;Heavenly&quot; everything else -- from the towels to the toiletries were nothing special. Complaints: Front desk staff not so helpful at check-in. There were three people behind the desk and they all needed to help the one couple who had credit card problems -- rather then help the couple that were ready to go (and the only other people in line). The concierge ladies were not knowledgeable and seemed to only mention the same bistro to guest after guest seeking restaurant recommendations. Overall, we would stay at the Essex House again if we desired a room overlooking Central Park. We are torn between staying here or at the Algonquin (where we stayed in September 2004). The dilemma: Do we prefer a fancy room (Essex House) or superior service (Algonquin)?"
245,1862,"Jan 16 2005	Essex House what about Essex Closet?	When visiting NY I usually stay in hotels on Central Park: Plaza (temp closing), Mayflower (Trump?) Park Lane, St. Moritz (now the Ritz), and Essex House. The staff was wonderful. From check-in to check-out everyone working at the Essex House were highly professional. The building's architecture, lobby, public rooms, and park location, spectacular. My room was another story. The room was on par with the Plaza. Old, soiled, small, and expensive. I had a park view room on the 11th floor. The &quot;view&quot; window was small and single paned. It was snowing ouside and the room was absolutely freezing. Cold air was seeping in from the unsealed pane, which was so thin I was able to hear the horses hoofs on the pavement (charming); as well as yells, horns, sirens, and conversations (not charming). The smallish plush queeen bed took up ALL the space in the room but was very comfortable. The carpets were stained yet the soft down comforter was a pristine white. The grey and white marble bathroom, very clean. And once again, the location can't be beat. Would I stay here again? No. But I was glad I experienced one stay at the historic Essex House ."
246,1862,"Jan 3 2005	First Big City Adventure	My husband's 50th birthday was celebrated at the Essex House, Central Park So. from 12/27/04 thru 12/30/04. We consider the Grand Hyatts our luxury hotels, so this was a new experience. We requested a room upgrade as the first shown was overlooking buildings towards the rear of the hotel. This was granted after some gentle assertiveness and our room on the 10th floor had a fab view of the park. The bed was indeed heavenly, the bath large and with a tub to accomadate the birthday boys 6 ft. 5 in. heigth and 300 lbs. frame ! The furnishings were in good condition and 2 closets for plenty of hanging space. I had requested some surprise goodies be prepared for his arrival....Perrier, navel oranges, chocolates, cheese, and fruit and crackers and this was very nicely presented with 2 roses. We found the staff to be very gracious and service was good. Our usual room service delights were curtailed as we found the cost excessive. The one morning we opted to have breakfast in the Botanica dining room we spent 28.00 plus tip and tax to total about 38.00 for 2 bowls of McCann oatmeal and 2 coffees. This is definitely a heist of the first order!! In my opinion, that is....Other mornings we had our breakfast at wonderful restaurants close by. We did not even consider the dining experience at the Ducasse room...At 150.00 prix fix that was way too out of our budget! In any event, the location, service, cleanliness and overall atmosphere at the Essex was very solid and we felt satisfied with our stay and first &quot;Big City Adventure&quot;. I would only hope for an in room coffee maker so we could have that first am jolt close at hand and not have to order up a 10.00 cup via room service (That would be with the 18% gratuity and room service charges etc, etc. We will return someday to NYC and hope to see more of the museums and enjoy more of the city..We would most definitely consider the Essex House."
247,1862,"Jan 2 2005	Very nice with a couple of ""buts""	Super convenient location for Central Park, major shopping, the subway, eating out and Broadway. Nice attentive staff and beautifully styled inside. The couple of &quot;buts&quot; are that our room was smaller than we had imagined and as shown in most photos we had found, just enough room to move around the bed, and that the bath itself was very small. We suspect this is because we had a cheaper room as we booked through Expedia and got a great price. The bed was lovely and was, as advertised, a &quot;Heavenly Bed&quot; and the shower was good. But the rest was OK, not fantastic but certainly not poor. We had Christmas Lunch in the hotel's Cafe Botanica and. although pricey, it was excellent. So overall I would recommend the Essex House on location alone but pay the extra for a bigger room if you really want something special rather than average."
248,1862,"Dec 31 2004	Great location unacceptably shabby room.	We stayed here on 12/28 for one night. I booked a 1 bedroom exterior view suite using my Starwood Preferred Points. We were assigned room 1723, which had a sign on it indicating it was a Starwood Preferred Guest Room.The Suite was huge and overlooked rooftops and one tower of the Time Warner Building. It had a small foyer, powder room and small living room with pull-out sofa and desk. The bedroom had a king sized bed, 2 night tables, a bench with a drawer and an armoir with a tv. Past the bedroom was a dressing room with no furniture but a large closet and safe. I found this area to be cold no matter what temperature the rest of the room was set on. The bathroom was suprisingly small considering the size of the rest of the suite. There was little (ie, no) counter space in the bathroom, and there was a small tub/shower with 3 shower heads (the heavenly shower), a bidet and toilet. The wallpaper, carpet and bed were new and clean. These were the exception. The rest of the room was unacceptably shabby - to the extent that it looked like a rock (ie metal) band had stayed there and trashed the room. The door to the room was banged with gashes and peeling paint that was visible from the hall. The armoir in the living room had chunks taken out of if and the door that covered the minibar had been literally ripped off of the unit, leaving a big gash in the unit and exposing the minibar. All other furniture was dented with peeling paint. In the bathrooms the countertops were pulling away from the sink bases. In the main bath, the tub was old and showed discoloration and there was some mold visible under the caulking around the tub.Service in the hotel was mostly good, and everyone we encountered was pleasant and helpful. Notable errors were that no one had cleaned up the mini bar area from the prior guests, who had eaten most of what was in there and left the trash behind. I had to ask 3 people before this was cleaned and replenished (we did not use it, but I did not want to be charged for the prior guests' use). We also confirmed turndown service twice and asked that the pull out sofa be opened and set up so my kids could sleep on it. When we arrived late in the evening, we had been given turn down service, but no one opened the sofa or even left linens for it. We then had to call and wait for this to be taken care of (we could not take care of it ourselves as there were no extra linens or pillows in the room).Food throughout the hotel was expensive but good. The toiletries in the bathroom were from Moulton Brown and were terrific. I would not hesitate to stay here again for free, but if I had paid the $650 that I was quoted for the room rate, I would have been upset at the shabbiness of the room.By the way, the Heavenly Bed is just that!"
249,1862,"Dec 30 2004	Wonderful Hotel!	This Hotel was worth every penny...even though I didn't have to empty my pocket. If you sign up for a Starwood Perferred Guest membership you get awesome discounts on all their hotels and extra benefits. I especially love their hotel chain because of their extra comfy beds. We were even upgraded for free. Everything was clean and the plumming worked great. We loved the location, nice and quiet and close to everything."
250,1862,"Dec 23 2004	Great Location Great Service!	My boyfriend and I have just returned from a beautiful Christmas visit to the city! We had booked the Essex House through an Internet offer I had received directly from Starwood hotels. It really pays to sign up for these programs, even if you dont stay that often! We booked our DEC 21st stay for a mere $179! Service was great from the moment we pulled up- the bellman took care of our luggage and our car was valet parked ($49 indoor garage parking for 24 hr period, no in/out privileges.) We were promptly checked in and given an upgrade to a king size corner room, simply because I had notated special romantic occasion on the comments section of the online booking form. The clerk was apologetic that he couldnt give us a king with a view of the park as they were all taken, but could give us a queen with a park view in a smaller room. Being that it was already dark outside, we graciously accepted the larger king. How Generous! And to think for $179 in Manhattan!The room was impeccably clean and comfortable. Dcor was clean and sophisticated with masculine colors and minimal furnishings. There were his and her closets, complete with automatic lighting elements a nice touch. The bathroom was a dark black marble with vintage styled fixtures. We called downstairs to the concierge who called ahead to the restaurant- Daniel a must try to let them know we were running late for our reservation. He offered to go ahead and ask the bellman to secure us a cab as well, which was waiting for us when we got downstairs. The next morning was peaceful with breakfast in bed very delicious, but definitely over priced at $23 for an egg/meat/pastry/OJ/Coffee combination. PLUS tax, 16% gratuity and a $3pp delivery charge, tallying up to an $80 breakfast for two, but who wanted to get out of bed to go to the diner around the block?We non-chalontly checked out at 12:30pm, without a word being said and no late fees before leaving our luggage in storage. We went ahead and enjoyed the city all day- WALKING EVERYWHERE WE WENT! The location of the Essex house is unbeatable! Upon return, our luggage was promptly retrieved from storage and loaded into our car waiting out front, while we enjoyed cocktails by the fireplace at the hotel bar, Journeys. Yes, $14 for each Martini, but it was a very cozy way to end our delightful stay! All in all, for Manhattan, this was an unbeatable value we had first class comfort and service for less than the price of the Holiday Inn! I dont think I would pay full price for this hotel though Just keep checking those specials!"
251,1862,"Dec 12 2004	Great Place to Stay	After doing tons of research I decided to stay at the St. Regis in the Essex House. Although the price was extremely high (what do you expect when its just a few weeks before Christmas) we were very pleased with our room. We had a &quot;Junior Suite&quot; and it was terrific. Probably the only surprise was we did not have the usual Westin upgrades such as a heavenly bed, double shower, etc. Fortunately, we called Daisy, our housekeeper, and she had some heavenly bedding brought right up. She said the St. Regis rooms were due to be upgraded early in 2005. The lobby is very peaceful and elegant with all the people there being very knowledgeable about the hotel and the whole area. I would have no problem staying there again."
252,1862,"Dec 1 2004	Great Location But Otherwise Disappointing	The location is fantastic--close to Broadway theatres, excellent restaurants, shopping, and museums. I would've appreciated the Central Park South location much more if I'd have a park view, but instead I had a view of brick walls &amp; ventilation ducts. I tried to use my Starwood points to upgrade my room, but Starwood makes it extremely difficult to do this--you have to wait till 5 days before arrival to even try to get an upgrade, and of course by then all the good rooms are gone. My room was sufficiently spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel decor is very dark &amp; conservative--way too Ralph Lauren for my taste. The housekeeping staff members were very noisy, intrusive, and overly aggressive. I had to call to complain because they were slamming doors and making way too much noise in the morning. They also kept calling and knocking on my door, even though I had the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign on my door--it was incredibly irritating, &amp; far below the standard I would expect from such an expensive hotel. I was really looking forward to staying at the Essex House, but overall, other than the great location, I'd have to say that it was a disappointment."
253,1862,"Nov 11 2004	Superb efficient and friendly	Just had a 5 night stay at the Essex House and enjoyed every minute of it. Slight problem when we were assigned a non-park view room, but a quick phone call to reception and ten minutes later we were in the 3rd floor park view room we had wanted with a great view though the trees into Central park (and a birds eye view of the Marathon!). The staff were always friendly, helpful and efficient, and we had no problems with check-out (despite asking for a late check-out), towncar airport transfer booking and luggage storage as we had a late flight back from Newark airport.The food is excellent, albeit expensive. Room service was fast with the hot, freshly made delicious meals (can heartily recommend the BLT, Cheesecake, and Ice Cream Sundae!). Breakfast at the Cafe Botanica was very nice and allowed us to watch the poor New Yorkers going off to work down Central Park South as we enjoyed a buffet breakfast, though it got a little loud with Businness people during weekdays. Cheaper food options include a Rays Pizza (very cheap but good pizza slices) just opposite the rear entrance of the hotel and the La Parisienne Deli just round the corner on 7th Avenue where we had delicious American style Breakfasts and quick evening meals in a typical American/New York style Deli/Diner just up the street from Carnegie Hall. Heartily recommended."
254,1862,"Nov 9 2004	Very Nice for the price I got...	Got a great corporate rate here while in town for business. I had stayed at the Hilton and Sheraton over the previous 4 weeks or so - then found this rate. I jumped on it because, well, it's the Essex House. Was not disappointed. A very nice room, that wonderful bed that you find at all Westin properties, a nice staff though not overwhelmingly friendly (except for the gentlemen that was by the elevators every day). Yes, it is old like most NY hotels. ANd most of their rooms do not have a view of the park unless you really want to pay for it. But, if you can get a good rate, why not stay here? It is a little bit of a treat for us road warriors to stay in a place that is not like all the other chains.I did not eat at the hotel...but hear it's very good - and expensive. But that's NY.I'd stay here again if I need to be in this part of town and can get my corp rate."
255,1862,"Nov 2 2004 	Too many better options in NY	Very surprised to read other reviews listed here. Travel to NY very frequently and was very disappointed in this Hotel. Yeah, it's on the Park but most rooms don't face it and those that do face the Park are closet size. Actually changed rooms 4 times (which I never do). Hotel is far too expensive not to have a decent room. Front desk clerk was downright rude and nasty. Hotel lobby is busier than Grand Central Station. Many New Yorkers use lobby to cross from 59th to 58th Street.. Creates chaotic, unwelcoming atmosphere. Hotel also nickels and dimes you for everything. $10 pp to use fitness center, $10 to have wine glasses brought to room, huge phone and internet fee, etc.Only highlight was restaurant and lounge atmosphere. That's it."
256,1862,"Oct 28 2004	Magnificent and cozy.	Lovely, centric, cozy luxurious hotel. It's quite expensive but worth it. Located right in front of Central Park. The restaurant is superb. The rooms are the top of the top. And the sheets... well... delicious. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at."
257,1862,"Oct 25 2004	Awesome location reasonable price very comfortable bed	The Essex House is in an awesome location right on Central Park. Our room was the basic room with a park view. The room wasn't huge but more than sufficient. The room had a great view of the park being directly across the street. The heavenly bed was the best bed I've ever slept on. I thought my bed at home was good but the heavenly bed was better. The shower had a nice double shower head system that worked great. The staff was always friendly and helpful. There were a couple of minor down sides of the room. The paint above the shower was peeling as was some wall paper in the bathroom. Also, the first night, there was a hole in one of the sheets. The Essex House overall was great and I would definitely stay there again."
258,1862,"Oct 5 2004	Our Favorite Hotel in NYC!	My husband and I stayed at the St. Regis Club at the Essex house for 4 nights last week and what a wonderful time we had. We were upgraded to a wonderfully appointed suite because of our Starwood Gold Preferred membership. Our bed was so comfortable and I wanted to take it home, as well as the shower. However, the staff is absolutely superd. Our housekeeper Daisy was a gem, she made sure our suite was perfect. She is a real asset to the hotel. Nina, the concierge was absolutely unrelenting in her pursuit to get us reservations at Elaines and Babbo, and she succeeded! She also made some wonderful recommendations to some other restaurants. I wish all concierge's were as diligent and kind as she was. To sum it up, we had a great trip, and this will be the only hotel we stay at for all future New York City trips."
259,1862,"Sep 17 2004	Best Visit Ever	We stayed at the St. Regis Club part of the Essex House. I wanted a minimum 350 sq ft room, which is pricy in NYC. $449/nite; 9/10/04- 9/12/04. We were upgraded to the Astor Suite; Park View, 600+sq ft. Unbelievable! I felt like Humphrey Bogart was going to walk in carrying the Maltese Falcon. Perfect condition, beautifully decorated in muted colors; an actual apartment with dining room table at one end of the Living Room. Quiet yet across from Central Park where there are many free activities. It was a pleasant change from Times Sq. where we usually stay."
260,1862,"Sep 14 2004	Loved the Essex House.	Stayed at the Westin Essex House Labor Day weekend (9/3-9/6) with my 5 year old daughter. Truly wonderful experience. The park view was fantastic. I would definetely recommend getting one. We were on the 11th floor and obtained good rates from Starwood website on their &quot;Buy 2 Nights Get One Night Free&quot; promotion. Well worth every penny. Nice size room, well decorated and clean. Staff, conceirge were all very nice and helpful. My daugher loves Central park, as do I, so the location was perfect us. For everything else we made great use of the subway station located at 57th and 7th. Saw Beauty and the Beast one night, did Circle Line another night, carriage ride around the park. You are also down the street from Columbus Circle/Time Warner building. Lots of stores to check out, especially the Whole Foods Market. We mainly ate out, so I can't comment on room service or hotel restaurants. The bed is truly heavenly, as is the shower. I plan on returning and staying at the Essex around winter holiday."
261,1862,"Sep 9 2004	Great	So great! I liked the location, it made everything easy to walk. It was quiet. Use the South entrance to avoid the smell of horse droppings."
262,1862,"Aug 26 2004	Enjoyed The Essex House	My husband and I and our 2 teenage boys stayed at the Essex House July 31-Aug 3 2004. As SPG members we were upgraded to the St Regis level (higher floors of the hotel). The room was magnificent - a suite with a great view of Central Park. The downside was that it only had 1 bed (the couch didn't pull out). I called for rollaways, which then crowded the room. The front desk promised to take care of it the next day if we would please leave our bags packed. Well, like an episode of &quot;While You Were Out&quot; they moved us to an even larger suite in the Westin level (still with a park view) while we were out sight seeing. Both of the rooms we were in were clean and large. The staff was very professional and helpful, especially the doormen/bellhops. I didn't feel I got good service from the concierge, however. I asked her if there were any family-friendly restaurants in the area. She responded yes (very long pause). I had to then ask what they might be, then where they were! I didn't think I needed to play 20 questions. The location can't be beat. Right across the street from Central Park, close enough to Times Square and the theaters to walk - but not nearly as crowded or noisy. It was easy to pick up the double decker bus tour across the street, as well."
263,1862,"Aug 25 2004	Great hotel! Loved it!	My girlfriend and I stayed at the Essex House in late July when we went to NYC for a wedding. We picked the hotel because of its location (fabulous) and its reputation. We were not at all disappointed. Our whole stay was great, from the Heavenly Bed in our room to the various hotel services we acessed. We upgraded to a room with a view of the Park, and I would highly recommend that. The concierge desk was very helpful in arranging limo service for us for a function we attended, and the price was reasonable by big city standards. The bar and restaurants in the hotel are all first rate and there are many great places to dine within a five minute walk of the hotel. I could go on and on, but let me conclude by saying that we were completely pleased and on our next visit to New York we will definitely be staying at the Essex House."
264,1862,"Aug 25 2004	Charming and reasonably priced!	My husband and I just returned from our trip to New York and we enjoyed everything about the lovely Art Deco Essex House. The room was clean, the bed very comfortable, the staff was friendly and we had an excellent view of Central Park! The location is perfect for walking around mid town and very close to the best shopping in New York. We would definitely stay there again, and consider it a New York staple."

1,1864,Nov 8 2009 	My new favorite hotel in New York City	I've stayed in several hotels in NYC and I will never stay anywhere else but the Lafayette House ever again! It's a beautiful hotel in a great location. I was traveling with two teenages and our room had a queen sized bed and they brought in a very comfortable air mattress. The room is very large for a NYC hotel room (sitting room with fireplace was gorgeous) and the bathroom was quite nice and well outfitted. If you want to stay in a place that is more like living in a NYC neighborhood than a box hotel --- this is your kind of place!
2,1864,"Sep 13 2009 	Absolutely gorgeous. Great for independent types.	If you want a concierge telling you where to go, and hot and cold running lattes and a spa with an in-house masseuse, this isn't the place for you. But if you like the privacy and peace of being in a real house, sleeping in a huge room (suite-sized, really), right smack bang in Noho just a stroll from Soho and Nolita and the LES and the West Village and well, everywhere, then this is the place for you. It's decoated, as mentioned, as though an eccentric, arty great-aunt did it in the late 40s and it hasn't been changed since. The bed is comfy (if a little noisy...), the tv is awesome (and has DVD player, HBO on demand, etc), the shower is INCREDIBLE and the bath is about four feet deep. One of the reviews alleged that it's not clean and everything is falling apart - completely untrue. It's spotless, and the threadbare rug is part of the charm, darling. Perhaps she'd be happier at a Marriott.The one thing that does need changing: the drapes. No matter how you arrange them, there's a two-inch crack on either side of the windows and light comes straight in. Not ideal for jetlag. There's no room service, as mentioned, but the B Bar and Grill next door does great coffee and brunch and incredible burritos, there's a sushi bar downstairs, Five Points around the corner does one of the best burgers I've ever tasted and well, it's New York. You're never going to starve, are you? Oh, and the staff, whilst not visible, are definitely available: I somehow broke the TV (damn remote controls) and sheepishly rang them to ask what to do. The guy came right up and fixed it within about one minute. That wouldn't be so quick in most hotels. I'd definitely stay here again... and I'd ask for a room with a courtyard. Those sound awesome.We go to NY a lot and tend to try new hotels each time... but I'm definitely coming back to Lafayette House. I wonder if I can get them to change the curtains first..."
3,1864,"Feb 25 2009 	A must see!	The most fabulous room we've ever stayed in. Had soooo much character and warmth. Perfect location, perfect atmosphere and perfect service. We didn't want to leave and will definitely go back!"
4,1864,"Feb 25 2009 	exquisite	Being an avid traveler I consider myself savvy in the process of choosing Hotels. My standards are quite high and I expect a great deal from the staff down to the quality of soap. I was hesitant to stay at a boutique hotel in NY as it is a departure from my usual mainstream choice, but the location was unbeatable. Upon arrival I realized this was going to be a unique experience. The hotel far surpassed my expectations and I found myself feeling as if I arrived at my own brownstone home in the city, outfitted with an exceptional staff. From the cozy feel of the rooms eclectic design and antique furniture to the grandeur of the high vaulted ceiling and oversized fireplace, the combination was exquisite. It will most defineitly be incorporated into my New York experience again and again."
5,1864,"Oct 20 2008 	quirky boutique hotel	this place was a real find. In the East Village with an excellent wine bar next door. We were upgraded to a room with a terrace (unfortunately it rained!). Nice touches including free bottle of wine, lovely toiletries, extremely comfortable bed. Not cheap but we loved it."
6,1864,"Oct 10 2008	Very charming but not for everyone	The hotel is in an excellent location between the NYU/village and the East Village. I was in NYC to enjoy the nightlife and shopping, not to sight-see. This is an old old building, 1848, &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; era if memory serves. This means that things are old and it is decorated in a similar style. If you are not used to real antiques and aren't fond of victorian style, this hotel won't be for you. If you like to be pampered by hotel staff 24/7 you won't like it. If you like to be left alone, you will. I do like it and It reminded me of similar old hotels in New Orleans. It is very charming but it is not full service, faux vintage &quot;modern luxury&quot; hotel. This also means it has no elevator and narrow steep victorian stairs. If you are person with mobility problems or disabilities, this hotel may be a no go for you unless you are on the ground floor. I stayed all the way on the top floor in a gigantic room. (pictured in the tripadvisor page) with a pleasant sitting area and fireplace. I had no noise problems, although I believe that your experience of this hotel *could* differ greatly depending upon which room you are in. Very important to me is the fact that the thick double paned windows of my room shut out the vast majority of the New York noise.. and best of all, they opened so I could enjoy fresh air if I wished. The cost was a fair value for New York ( New York hotel rates are way higher than the rest of the country) given the size of the room, but not if you were expecting modern fixtures. If you appreciate the style, this room would be excellent for a romantic get away (or for someone like me who appreciates a bit of history). It has a large deep bath tub. Negative is a shower that requires some arcane knowledge and skill to operate. Positive: I had several special requests that were met right away. In contrast to what some others have written, I found the hotel staff to be very cheerful and responsive. One possible warning: They are doing construction across the street. While I was staying there no work was being done, just a big hole in the ground, but I would check first. For me the mood, privacy, service and excellent location outweighed any negatives. I would definitely choose it again."
7,1864,"Oct 8 2008 	Disappointing	I recently stayed at the Lafayette House in New York City. I saw the reviews online and was convinced it sounded like a very nice new boutique hotel. Overall the reviews were overrated and you can definitely do much better for a similar price.Pluses:1. Great neighborhood/location downtown 2. Nice sized room with a working fireplace, chandelier and sitting room3. Pretty terrace that opened out into the courtyard downstairs. Enjoyed it very much especially with the early Fall weather.4. Free Wi-Fi5. Small Kitchenette with mini-bar amenities6. C.E. Bigelow products7. Nice big king sized bed BUT see belowMinuses: We stayed in Room 4.1. Bed reeked of cigarette smoke. When you are visiting NY for a day and a half and paying $425/night for 2 nights TO SLEEP the last thing you want is (literally) a smelly night's sleep. Manager promised to have all pillows, mattress pad, blanket and sheets replaced but when the maid came, we did not see any of the so called replacement supplies. In order to avoid the same problem, I emailed that morning requesting that she ASK the maid to make sure her instructions were followed. Instead of being profusely apologetic, understanding and bending over backwards to be helpful, I got a snide response saying I should think about moving rooms or to another hotel (not ideal when I was working all day and not returning late that night). I have emails to prove it. Guests should NEVER have to apologize for a cigarette-smelling bed. I don't care how new or boutique the hotel is. And yes, the bed still smelled the second night.2. Manager was virtual. We only communicated via email the entire time. Never saw her once, never got a consolation fruit basket, nothing. The worst part was at 7am, someone started literally banging on the pipe. Free yet unwanted alarm clock. Not the hotel's fault but still...added more discomfort to an already bad situation.3. Decor was not my style - Dusty rose velour curtains, shabby chic style but it looked more shabby than chic (to me). Some people may adore this look but I personally like to see antiques refurbished and appropriated the way Kelly Wearstler does it. Overall, room looked like your grandparents old townhouse from 1898 (think the Age of Innocence 1898, not Manhattan 2008)4. Bathroom was disgusting and old. Not old and preserved in a good way but broken tiles, sink was scuffed, mirror was hung too high and not what you would expect from a nice (albeit residential townhouse) hotel.5. LIGHTING - It's poorly lit everywhere. It's caters more to mood rather than task. I would like to know how women are supposed to apply makeup in the dark poorly-lit bathroom.6. Mediocre Service - If you are going to have a residential hotel, service should be impeccable.This is a more DIY, deal with what you get place. If things don't work, hotel won't care. They say they will fix something but won't.Room #10We booked an additional room for a guest who WANTED to stay here and actually suggested it and just today told us his room had &quot;ghosts&quot;.Overall the place feels like the Chelsea hotel with slightly better appointed furniture. But you can't really get away from that dark, danky feel. I'm used to better rooms and better service. This one is a NO for me."
8,1864,"Jul 14 2008 	Great hotel for families with young kids	We stayed at the Lafayette for 10 days while our house was being renovated. We have 3 kids age 5, 4 and 1.5 years old. We stayed in a room with a kitchenette that had access to the courtyard garden. We had a great experience. This is not a typical hotel with a front desk and lots of amenities, but we didn't miss any of these things. The location is ideal for young kids. It's very close to Washington Square Park, Children's Museum of Art, Joe's Pub and other places where young children can be amused. There is a Wholefoods store 5 minutes walk away and a kids-friendly restaurant next door for brunch (B Bar). The hotel manager is excellent and they provided us with a huge blow-up bed as well as a crib, so we all stayed in the same room. The kitchenette makes a huge difference and the kids were dining on steak, salmon and haricots verts every night!"
9,1864,"May 28 2008 	Amazing room	Last December as I was contemplating where to stay in Manhattan for my daughter's graduation from NYU , I received a card in the mail from Lafayette House which is owned by the same group as The Bowery. Having loved The Bowery and intrigued by the thought of staying in a 15 room townhouse instead of a hotel I booked 3 rooms. We were not disappointed.The doors are kept locked so you have to buzz the office to get in. We were led to our rooms which encompassed the entire first floor (below the entry level). These were by far the largest rooms we have had in NYC in the 15 or so trips we have made in the past 4 years. Each room had a sitting area with fireplace and my room even had a small kitchenette. The rooms are individually furnished with beautiful antiques. The bed was extremely comfortable and outfitted with first class linens. The highlight was the lovely courtyard that was shared by my room and the one my 2 high schoolers shared. It was the perfect place to unwind with a book after a day of walking the city.The only things I would change would be the bathroom in my room really should have been totally redone not just updated. The one in the kids room was and it was fabulous. Also the a/c unit was in an awkward location and did not include a remote so someone from the office had to come turn it on. Speaking of the office--they are only there during office hours. My kids locked themselves out of their room at 8am and we had to wait for someone to get there to let them back in.There are many restaurants nearby so the lack of one on the property was a non issue. We did go to The Bowery for a glass of wine one night and were not exactly warmly welcomed by the host in the lobby (I guess we are not hipster enough) until we mentioned that were staying at Lafayette House. If you are looking for a more low key, local NYC experience Lafayette House is definitely the place for an amazing trip."
10,1864,Apr 7 2008 	Elgant branch... tellement New York !
1,1865,Nov 24 2009 	Hotel was perfect!	The hotel is right around the corner from the Empire State Building and walking distance from Times Square. Staff was very helpful and the hotel was very clean and comfortable.
2,1865,"Nov 19 2009 	Clean comfortable good location	This hotel is in a good location near Penn Station. Room was clean,affordable and quiet..Would stay here again."
3,1865,"Nov 1 2009 	Excellent Location - old hotel	The location of this hotel is excellent. It is only 2 minutes walking to nearby subway station and surrounded by many great restaurants. 2 doors down it is a Korean grocery store that opens until midnight. I often worked late in downtown, but had so issue getting back by subway and finding something to eat nearby and feeling absolutely safe. The hotel service was great. Once I called for help with free internet, someone showed up in just a few minutes. The hotel offers free continental breakfast - nothing fancy but it helps starting the day easier. Although I have not used it, the hotel does offer free phone calls within US.The hotel is old and the elevator is slow. During my 4 days of stay, one of the elevators was broken for 3 days and I ended up taking up to 10 minutes waiting for the elevator in the morning. Taking shower was a big adventure in my room. The water temperature changed back and forth between icy cold and burning hot in seconds.I wish La Quinta could give me choice between non-smoking and smoking rooms when I make my reservation at its web site. When I checked in, I forgot to ask for non-smoking room and the front-desk person never asked my preference, I ended up being assigned to a smoking room."
4,1865,"Oct 7 2009 	Great Value-would stay again for sure	I have no complaints whatsoever about this hotel. The room was a bit small, but on par with other NYC hotels. Nice new flat screen TV, very comfortable memory foam mattress, AC/Heat worked great. The hotel was very quiet and in a great location; close to Times Square, The Empire State Building, Penn Station, etc. The hotel was very clean and the staff was professional and friendly. Check-in/Check-out was fast and effortless. When we were leaving the bellman stood in the street with a whistle to get us a cab to the airport. The breakfast was ok, cereals, milk, juice, yogurt, bagels, donuts, muffins and coffee. The wireless inetrnet worked fine for us on the 10th floor. I really don't think you can find a better value in Manhattan."
5,1865,"Oct 4 2009 	very small room but has everything you need	The room was small. I booked a kings bed to find out I only got a queen. Location was excellent in the middle of Korea town and very very close to 5th,6th and broadway. I felt safe at night in the area as it was a busy section of midtown. The staff were friendly. the breakfast was basic but reasoable. Once I came back to the room at about 23:00 it was a bit noisy from a party on the roof. I would stay there again if I came for a very short time and by myself. I was told that they have slightly bigger rooms but I was disappointed that I did not receive what I have booked and paid for. I paid around $210 including the tax."
6,1865,"Oct 2 2009 	Did not like neighborhood. Moved to other hotel on third night.	We booked 2 double beds for four nights. We walked from Penn Station (easy walk) and tried to check in at 4pm after a day of travel. The room was not ready and we were told to come back in an hour. We returned more than an hour later and still had to wait in the lobby. This is a small hotel with a very unattractive front desk, unattractive people and unattractive views. Most views are of the street or a brick wall. The room was large, uninspired and dark. Comfortable bedsVery cleanLarge roomsfree internetfree breakfastFair priceWe were very unhappy with the neighborhood - crowded, dirty, crummy stores, just felt unsafe. We notified the hotel the next morning 10 am that we were checking out and they made us pay for the room that night so we were forced to stay another night. We moved to the Thompson Hotel on Allen for our last two nights which was amazing for the same price as La Quinta."
7,1865,"Sep 30 2009 	Pro active general manager	We planned a mini vacation to New York in Sept. 2009 and stayed at Laquinta Manhattan. While my family and I were there I left my cam corder in the Business Center and the next day it was gone. I reported the situation to the General Manager who immediatly took actions and reviewed all the camera recoding of the hotel with me. Based on the review of the recordings, staff identified the person who took the camera,but he no longer was in the hotel. General manager asked his staff to keep an eye for the person who stole the camera and meanwhile he contacted the local police and the local hotels with information and the picture of the person who stole the camera. Surprisingly the same person showed up at the hotel and wanted to use the Business Center. The General manager Mr. Victor Alim and his staff confronted the thief and got the camera back. During the whole ordeal staff and the General manager conducted themselves in a profesional maner and I certainly believe that a good hotel is run only by capable people. Thanks."
8,1865,"Sep 28 2009 	Good deal in midtown Manhattan	It's practically impossible to find a decent hotel in midtown Manhattan for under $200/night, but I kept checking until I ran across the La Quinta on West 32nd Street and jumped on it. The location absolutely can't be beat--less than a block from the Herald Square subway station between Broadway and Fifth Avenue, only a few blocks from Times Square and almost directly behind the Empire State Building, and only a couple of blocks from Penn Station. The room was small, as are most NYC hotel rooms, but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom and shower were very good. A couple of nitpicks--it's VERY easy to walk past this place; unlike other hotels in the area there's no banner sign, only smallish plaques on the facade. The elevators are pretty slow, but I was on the second floor and mostly used the stairs. The outlets on the desk didn't work but I'm used to using my laptop on the bed so that was no big deal. The free internet worked fine until the last full day of my stay, Sunday, when it was down all day. Fortunately someone in the area had an open connection so I hooked up on that. If you like Korean food you're in luck, as the hotel is on &quot;Korea Way&quot; and is literally surrounded by 24-hour Korean BBQs. If you don't there's a small deli called Speedy's down the block that makes good sandwiches and hot food, and the usual fast food suspects plus some Irish pubs are very close by. For being so close by hot spots the room was pretty quiet. If you're by yourself or with someone with whom you don't mind sharing close quarters you're probably not going to do better than the La Quinta if you want to stay in midtown--I'll definitely keep this place in mind next time I come to NYC."
9,1865,"Sep 26 2009 	Good Value	We stayed here for 8 nights &amp; were very pleased overall. Rooms are a decent size for NYC with a nice flat-screen TV, &amp; it was quiet. Liked the free Internet &amp; phone + a printer available in the `business center' downstairs. Bed was comfortable as long as you don't mind it very soft. Decent bagels included in the breakfast, but everything else is over-sweetened American food + some truly awful coffee."
10,1865,"Sep 20 2009 	Awesome Location	I loved this hotel. The room was small but unless you want to spend over 300 a night, that is typical New York, especially when the buildings are so old. Cleanliness was immaculate, staff was exceptionally friendly. Water pressure and abundance of hot water was fantastic. Continental breakfast was just perfect to get the day started. What I really loved the most was the location. 1 block from the Empire State Building, 1 block from access to the subway, 1 block from the largest Macy's in the world... Anything you need is within a short walk. I cannot wait to come back, I will definitely stay here again."
11,1865,"Sep 18 2009 	Good value for money	Great location, clean rooms, good price and fine breakfast included!"
12,1865,"Sep 11 2009 	Very good location great value	Pros:- Location in Korea Town: Close to Metro Stations, loads of Korean and Indian restaurants closeby, direkt next to the Empire State Building, 5-Minute walk to Flatiron Building and Macys- Clean, quiet rooms, comfortable beds- free breakfast, internet and national calls, no extra and high carges like in other hotels- cool rooftop bar with Empire state building view- friendly staffCons:- if you like a hot breakfast including eggs etc. this is not the right Hotel for you- no amenities like a pool and a fitness centre, but who needs that in NYC anyways"
13,1865,"Sep 1 2009 	Great location and good value but a bit frayed around the edges.	This is my fourth stay at this hotel but the first since it has been a La Quinta. Last stay was in 2004 when it was still The Best Western.The hotel is in a great spot in mid-town just a block away from The Empire State Building. Reservation was hassle free via the hotel's own web site and the correct rate was charged subsequently by the hotel. Staff were very friendly although maid service was a little erratic in both timing and efficacy. I expect rooms to be serviced by 4:30 pm ! On my fist day there was a blob of old toothpaste till on one of the bathroom walls. No big deal but ...... I reported a broken door catch on day one and this was still unrepaired when I left seven days laterThe rooms are looking a little care worn these days and could for example do with some new carpets and maybe a lick of paint wouldn't go amiss in the corridors. They are also tiny, but hey this is NYC. Apart from the toothpaste episode the bathroom was kept spotless.The Liberty desk lamps are unfortunately no longer a feature of the rooms ;-(Continental breakfast is served every morning and looked OK but I didn't try it and so can't really comment.The roof top bar is great and affords a magnificent view oh The Empire State Building.Plus Points:Right in the middle of where you want to be. Very close to Penn' StationGood rates for ManhattanFriendly StaffRoof Bar !!!Still my favourite Hotel in NYCCleanMinus PointsA bit tired these days could do with a bit of TLC"
14,1865,Aug 29 2009 	Great Experience	We stayed here on a weekend and had a very good experience. The location can't be beat as it is close to everything. Next to Herald Square and right behind Empire State Building. Penn Station and Macy's are a few blocks away.The rooms were large and just been remodeled with flat screen TVs and tempurpedic mattresses. What a treat! Includes a free breakfast too. This will be our home when we come back to New York.
15,1865,"Aug 20 2009 	Don't Stay Here!	I have been to New York 6 times. This may well be the worst hotel in Manhattan! The staff doesn't care about guests and were completely not helpful. There was hair on every towel I received. The elevators are used mostly by people not staying at the hotel who are using the bar on the 14th floor. Be prepared for very long elevator waits! The ice machines are noisy and one night I was woken up by an employee bashing a ladder outside my room. The breakfast is all white-carbs. Nothing like other La Quinta breakfasts! The free internet is fine, but a lot of time it was down. This hotel is old and grungy and I hated every minute of my stay. It's on a dirty, disgusting street. Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else. When I told the manager (via email) how unhappy her was, he replied, &quot;what would you like me to do?&quot; No concept of customer satisfaction!"
16,1865,"Aug 18 2009 	Great Budget Hotel in a great location!	La Quinta in Korea town in New York City - a really great budge hotel. First and foremost, the location is just 1/2 a block from the 34st subway line which feeds tons of trains. Only one stop down from the Time Square station that feeds every other train you would ever need to catch. Our room was on the 5th floor and was very clean, non-smoking (didnt have any smell at all), and the bed was a foam-top king.. extremely comfortable. Rooms are small.. but I fully expected this. Plenty of room for the two of us.. and we spent most of our time outside of the hotel.. for our type of travel it was perfect. If you plan on spending a lot of time in your room you might be better off somewhere else.Being in a very busy area of town I was pretty nervous about noise. The room was dead silent.. could not hear a peep from the streets below (we overlooked 32nd Street). The counter staff were very nice and got me setup quickly w/o issue. The cleaning woman who I saw everyday was super friendly and helpful. (we left in kinda a rush and forgot to leave a tip.. I feel very bad for that)The rooftop bar is small and pretty packed.. if you enjoy the nightlife, its really only an elevator trip away...which leads me to my only real complaint of the whole place: The elevators are horrible. In the evenings when people are going up to the rooftop bar, you will typically be stuck waiting for a long time to get an elevator. I found myself taking the stairs more often that I would prefer, but it was not a huge issue.Overall, for the price, I could not ask for more. Quiet, clean, great location and friendly staff. Would highly recommend."
17,1865,"Aug 10 2009 	Check your reservation details before you get there!	Location is great! It is pretty much right in the middle from Chinatown to Central Park. It's about 20 blocks or so to Central park, and but you better take the subway to Chinatown, but it's a short ride. The room is very very small. But what do you expect.. You at least have a room with a very comfortable bed, your own bathroom, and an in-room safe that works. The room smelled a bit like mold.. but it will do..What I did NOT like about this hotel is the service.. At check in and check out, the customer rep actually offended me with their smirks.. They charged me extra things for no reason.. Just make sure you print out your confirmation letter with you, so they can't charge you extra stuff.. It was not at all a good start or ending to what could have been a better weekend. I will stay here again next time, just because it's cheap and its great centralized location.. but that's about it.. (Don't even eat their continental breakfast.. it sucks..)"
18,1865,"Aug 10 2009 	beware of credit card refusal!	if u get an automatic reservation then followed by a reservation confirmation letter and u follow this up with a phone call the morning u are supposed to check in to say u will b coming late night u would assume that u have a room....but not so at la quinta where my husband landed at 11p.m after an international flt to b told that his credit card used for the reservation had been refused and they did not have a room.we also had a confirmed reservation for the next day for a doubleroom wherein another credit card had been accepted so the management could easily have used that card to confirm the earlier reservation.the only help they did was to direct him to another hotel way out of the way for that night n he had to check out the next day to move back to la quinta...something is wrong with this system n the management should find a way of setting this right!!but if do manage to get ure room u r lucky...cos great location..very comfortable king size bed(i found the room size def on the large side),good shower n breakfast(a little crowded but u do get good food) and the free internet n free US calls is a great bonus..."
19,1865,"Aug 7 2009 	Great choice great location great value	I have stayed at this hotel 4 times. And I have never had a problem there. I was quickly checked into my room. The guy at the front desk wasn't overly friendly, but he wasn't rude either. That comment was based on other negative reviews that I had read. But to his credit, it was 230am. This hotel provided exactly what I was looking for. The positives 1. the location. It's walking distance to many attractions 2.the rooms were clean and the mattresses were very comfortable.3. Breakfast is included. They have toast, bagels,donuts, cereal (hot and cold), yogurt, fruit and juices and coffee. What more do you want? It saves a lot of time searching for a place to eat. You can then move on with your day and do what you came to New York City for. 4.the roof-top patio. It's quaint, and offers a great view of the Empire State Building. I usually go there before or after my evening out.4.Internet service in basement to pick up emails.I went with my sisters on my third visit. One of my sisters wanted to try another hotel that she had previously stayed at. I convinced her to try this hotel and now she recommends it to everyone.Also, when I have checked out other discount hotels on websites, the price never matches La Quinta. Try it. I think you will be pleasantly surprised."
20,1865,"Aug 2 2009 	very good value for the money	very clean room and comfortable bed. continental breakfast, daily newspaper, safe box and coffee in room. very convenient location steps from Herald square. all that in a surprising price - great value for the $. we stayed 3 days and enjoyed."
21,1865,"Jul 31 2009 	Great rates and as you would expect not perfect	This is a bargain-priced hotel in the shadows of the Empire State Building, near Broadway on 32nd Street, in the Korean neighborhood of Manhattan. It is part of the Apple Core Hotels group, which prides itself on satisfactory accomodations without the traditional high New York prices. Staff is friendly enough, and I felt secure and for the most-part comfortable. My AARP rate of a little over $125 per night USD included high-speed internet and continental breakfast, plus business and fitness centers in the basement, and my small room with a king-size bed overlooking 32nd Street. Those are the &quot;pros.&quot; The first &quot;con&quot; is that my room seemed -- even allowing this was New York -- noisy. The trash trucks come along 32nd Street in the 1 - to- 3 a.m. time frame and take a very, very long time to collect huge numbers of sacks of trash from all the Korean restaurants from the previous day. This isn't any quick trash-collection run like &quot;back home,&quot; it is a very loud, slow, institutional one. Other &quot;cons&quot; included (1) that the housekeeper didn't come by to clean my room when she said she would (I had adjusted my schedule to accomodate that, all for naught); (2) parts of the room looked worn and in need of spruce-up, but in the hotel's defense there are signs everywhere that new furniture is in the process of being installed; (3) elevator service can be crowded and slow; (4) if you make a reservation through LaQuinta's computer system, be aware that the &quot;Returns&quot; (frequent guest) ID number may not make it onto your record in the hotel's different computer system -- I had to make a couple phone calls after I got home before I got my points. Obviously, none of those &quot;cons,&quot; with the possible exception of the noise, will in themselves ruin a stay, so if you can accept them in return for bargain New York rates, I will recommend. Just don't expect luxury -- you aren't paying for it and you won't get it."
22,1865,"Jul 31 2009 	Great accommodations for the business traveler at an excellent price	The La Quinta at 17 West 32nd Street exceeded all my expectations for what I would consider to be a budget-friendly hotel:Professional, friendly, helpful staffCleanRoom was good-sized (especially for Manhattan)VERY reasonably pricedEasily accessible, FREE, high-speed internet accessConvenient location near 32nd and BroadwayFREE continental breakfast (including fruit)"
23,1865,"Jul 30 2009 	Okay if desparate	So the rooms are small, clean, convenient. The roof top bar means that you may have to wait in line to share the elevator with a bunch of drunks. It also means that a couple of these folks may get lost leaving and find themselves outside your door loudly discussing how to get back to the elevator. If you stay here, get every transaction from the front desk in writing. I originally reserved for 4 nights; canceled the last night when I checked in. When I checked out the clerk said &quot;Oh we thought you were staying tonight.&quot; No. &quot;Oh okay, no problem.&quot; I got my credit card bill a month later with four nights charged! In the first three phone calls the manager assured me he would &quot;look into it.&quot; Never called back. In our last call he informed me that they have no way of knowing when I checked out. Strange in this age of computers. No one remembers anything about it. And he is sure his employees would never make a mistake. So I am a liar. When I asked if he cared about repeat customers, he offered a discount that would buy a cup of coffee in NYC which I won't use because there are lots of hotels near the subway in NYC with small, clean rooms...and even a few drunks in the hallway. Some of them must have a computer at the front desk. Keep looking."
24,1865,"Jul 23 2009 	Absolutely frustrating.	I've stayed at this hotel in the past and stay at Laquinta's frequently. This by far was one of my worst experiences. Upon check in the gentleman behind the counter said my credit card was declined due to the expiration date. The date on the card was obviously good. I called the credit card company in front of them and they said it was clear the problem wasn't with my card but with the hotel. He then proceeded to explain to me that my room had been cancelled because my card had been declined. He could give me a room but would need another card. I only had my debit, wich I dislike. In the end the man was rude and never offered any customer service concerning. I asked for the phone number for the management and he refused. There is obviosly an issue with the system in that hotel because I see that someone else had a similiar experience.This type of issue should be investigated to ensure everyones safety."
25,1865,"Jul 23 2009 	Top Value for Midtown	I had been used to paying $300 a night for a room at very ordinary hotels in midtown Manhattan, so paying half that for excellent accommodations within walking distance of Penn Station, Macy's, etc. was a refreshing change. The room is tiny - most of it taken up by the king-size bed - but the bed is really top-notch. The amenities in the room and bathroom are all clean and new. Wireless Internet is a plus. The closet safe accommodates your laptop. The noise level is acceptable (there are no quiet places in Manhattan). The room is really a very pleasant little nook. Unlike some visitors who have reviewed here, I had no problems with the staff - indeed, when on one stay I forgot my beautiful toiletries bag, full of expensive cosmetics, the housekeeper kept it until my next visit. Honesty goes over big with me.I will say that on one stay, the boiler had broken and I was unable to take a shower. I asked for and received a discount to make up for the inconvenience. The other 'problem' at this hotel is the slow elevators; if the hotel is fully booked there can be a line in the lobby to get on. You may want to request a high floor room so as to ensure yourself a spot in the elevator in the morning.The 'continental breakfast' is weak; pastries, juice, coffee, cereal etc are all pretty bad. I'd skip most of it and maybe just take a yogurt and a banana. Given that you are paying half the going rate for a nice room in midtown, I don't hold it against the hotel. You can take your savings and treat yourself to a fancy breakfast somewhere else. All in all a great bargain and a positive experience on several trips."
26,1865,"Jul 22 2009 	Clean Neat Memory foam beds Awesome shower curtain PLEASE bring back hard boiled eggs	We arrived early for check in on a very hot July 4 and Ronica was so courteous and checked us into an available room. She showed initiative by asking for our AAA card and was very helpful in determining what floor we would like. As I am a light sleeper, I appreciated her concern. Thank you! We stayed in a comfortable room, KS bed. It was very clean and neat and the bed was so comfortable. We were so tired we took an afternoon nap but were woken up by hammering on the floor above us. We found out later they were installing flat screen TVs. Better than hammering at night time! The shower curtain in our room was almost clear (so much better than the regular 2 layers of dark yuk curtains) Awesome. Breakfast was well stocked. It was a busy morning and the gentleman taking care of the food was working hard . But PERLEASE bring back hard boiled eggs LA Quinta people. Some protein in the morning is a very good thing!"
27,1865,"Jul 21 2009 	Bad customer relations	My stay wasn't uncomfortable. But when i found out afterwards that they didn't apply the AAA discount, the hotel manager's attitude was &quot;it's not our responsibility to ask for your AAA card&quot; and the customer service couldn't care less. I had a confirmation printout of my reservation with the discounted price on it which i presented that at the time of check-in, but they didn't tell me that they were charging me more than the printed price. (By the way, how about putting a reminder on the confirmation?) To be fair they did offer to correct it. All i needed was an apology, and assurance that it wouldn't happen again, but instead i got &quot;Is it worth to have all this conversation for a few dollars?&quot; Well, firstly, they can keep that money, and secondly, this time i'll be staying at a more expensive hotel which treat their customers better."
28,1865,"Jul 19 2009 	Excellent for the price and the few steps from EMPIRE.....	Good atention, small room, but clean. FREE INTERNET, I will come again."
29,1865,"Jul 10 2009 	It's alright	The hotel itself was nice enough. It looked good on the inside, however is easy to miss if you're driving or even walking. The staff was alright, but I've found most people in NY don't seem happy. So I'll say the staff was as nice as the staff usually is? The location was ok, but I don't think I've ever walked that much in my life. It's definitely far from everything but the Empire State Building, but it's really close to all the subways, so that was a plus! The breakfast was good, had a lot of variety. You have to go up on the roof! They have a little lounge area there, and you get an awesome view. It's a great place to chill after a day of playing tourist. They also have memory foam, which was fun to try, and was great to have after a long day.While we were leaving someone from the hotel called us a taxi. It was really hard to understand him, but the guy said don't let the taxi driver charge me more than something...because something something. Anyways, the taxi driver was terrible, and I'm pretty sure ripped us off big time. But I guess it's my fault I didn't ask the person to repeat himself with the price."
30,1865,"Jul 9 2009 	It was a great stay	My wife, 16-year old daughter and I stayed at the La Quinta Manhattan and considered it one of the best values we've ever experienced. The location is good for anyone who is looking for a centrally located place to stay. A few walking minutes to Times Square, nearby subway stop and easy walking distance to several Big Apples attractions (Empire State Building, Macy's, etc.).The two Queen bed (excellent mattresses, by the way) room was outfitted with new furniture and plenty for our party, flat panels were being installed while we were there. The bathroom was clean and neat. We were on the 12th floor and street or the upstairs M Bar (just as a side note  do not miss the opportunity, you should visit this Bar and enjoy an amazing Empire State Building view!) was not a problem. Wireless Internet worked fine and when we needed the Business Center PCs, we did not have any problems.The hotel crew (front desk, maids and bellboy) and the free breakfast made our stay just GREAT. La Quinta Manhattan will be our NY home from now on!"
31,1865,Jul 7 2009 	Not friendly	Never stay in this hotel. I booked through online. They jacked up the price when I checked in. The front desk pople are not nice. Will not recommend
32,1865,"Jul 7 2009 	Rude desk clerk! -- adequate hotel	I recently stayed at the LaQuinta Manhattan for a total of 8 nights. I found the hotel itself to be adequate in fact quite good, however the front desk clerk with whom I originally checked in with is absolutely the worst person in the hospitality business that I have ever come across. I have traveled extensively both for business and pleasure and have never met such a rude, unhelpful and uncooperative person that works in the &quot;hospitality&quot; business. After originally departing from Oregon, our flight was delayed for 2 hours in Denver due to weather at which time I called the LaQuinta Manhattan directly to let them know that we were going to be checking in very late, possibly early in the morning. Once we finally got on the aircraft we had another 2 hour delay while sitting on the tarmac due to mechanical problems, so again I called LaQuinta (while on the plane) to let them know we would be delayed even further. Both times I called I was assured by the front desk clerk that it would be no problem and that they would hold our reservation (which was guaranteed with a credit card) and then I was further transferred to the reservation desk so that they could make a note of it. My daughter and I were originally supposed to arrive at the hotel about 11 pm, however with the airline delays, we didn't arrive until 5 am. To my horror, when I got to the reservation desk, &quot;R&quot; said she had no reservation under my name! I even provided my paperwork for my online reservation and she insisted that my reservation was cancelled due to a &quot;no show.&quot; However, she stated that she could still provide me with a room, but it would be at a much higher rate!! Then, even though I told her that I called twice and was told that it would be held, she would not budge and was extremely rude. I then insisted that she call the reservation number to verify my reservation since I had been assured that my reservation would be held. However instead of handling the problem herself, she told me to call the Applecore reservation line myself using the house phone. I did so and reached Debbie, a customer service rep. who thankfully ended up being an advocate. She apologized for the mix-up and said that she still showed a reservation for me and did not understand why &quot;R&quot; would not have the same reservation. She asked to speak with &quot;R&quot; who proceeded to argue with Debbie over the phone, and would not check us into our room until Debbie actually faxed over a copy of our reservation!!!!! Almost 45 minutes later (close to 6 am) we were finally checked into our room!! This was our first visit to New York and we had heard that New Yorkers could be rude, however I think it's pretty sad if the worst experience of our stay was with the front desk clerk of the hotel whom we stayed with for 8 nights, and by someone who is supposed to in the hospitality business!!! PS. Like in a previous review, I also wondered how the complimentary breakfast was monitored since anyone could basically walk in off the street into the breakfast room. It was usually packed and I wondered if everyone was actually a guest at the hotel. I think they should require room cards for entry into the breakfast room and the business center. A time limit for computer use in the business center would also be good. On the night that I wanted to print my boarding pass, a couple of teenagers were on &quot;myspace&quot; for hours... I finally had to ask to use a computer."
33,1865,"Jun 23 2009 	Who says a Manhattan hotel has to be expensive to be great? Loved it!	My 15-year old son and I stayed at the LaQuinta Manhattan and considered it one of the best values we've ever experienced. The location is near-perfect for anyone who's touring in the city (under five minutes to Times Square from the nearby subway stop and easy walking distance to Empire State Building, Macy's, etc. And don't miss the big 99-cent store just a few blocks east on 32nd St!) The front desk staff was courteous and quick with check-in at rush hour at 3 pm.. The rooms were being outfitted with all-new furniture and feature memory foam mattresses (a great night's sleep). My son fell in love with the iPod-ready alarm clock that let him play his music in the room. The room size is what you'd expect for a budget Manhattan hotel, but plenty spacious enough for two people. The bathroom was one of the cleanest I've ever seen at a budget location anywhere. We were on the 8th floor on 32nd St. side of the building and street noise was not a problem. To top it all off, the free breakfast was just what we needed -- cold cereal, bagels, toast, donuts, yogurt, granola bars, fresh fruit and juices. And all this for LESS than I paid a year ago to stay in the same chain's location in Queens. (Tip: be sure to use your AAA card and save 10%) Conclusion: the LaQuinta Manhattan is my Big Apple destination from now on, and it should be yours too."
34,1865,"Jun 19 2009 	A Great NYC Value!	My 10 year old daughter and I spent 3 nights at the La Quinta Manhattan and were pleasantly surprised with the experience. The location is terriffic! Close to the subway, shopping &amp; the Empire State Building. The rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. Try to avoid getting a room next to the ice machine as they are very noisy. The business center is a great convenience and with internet free internet access no need to travel with a computer. The hotel staff was very accomodating and even offered to store our luggage after check out so we could enjoy the day before our evening flight out. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone, especially those looking for a affordable accomodations. A suggestion to the hotel, install lighting over the bedroom mirror so that customers can put on make up in the bedroom while the steam clears in the bathroom.Thanks for a great stay!"
35,1865,"Jun 18 2009 	Excellent Choice	Excellent Choice! The La Quinta Manhattan is reasonably priced, convenient to Amtrak, the subway, busses, and taxis, and is clean, and offers all of the necessary amenities we required (breakfast , a concierage, free nationwide calling). We were very pleased and satisfied."
36,1865,"Jun 10 2009 	very clean not expensive and comfy...	This hotel was recommended by CAA considering our needs. We stay there 4 nights and we found the room to be very clean, even if we were on the 12th floor, the water pressure in the shower was excellent at any time. The king size bed was very comfortable (visco elastic topper, bug don't live in foam...) This hotel is well located on 32st also call Korean Way there's a subway station few steps away . I think you get a very good return for your money. The breakfast was OK and it was good not to have to go out for it, it was a good starter! Anyway, if you're not sure and do not want to spend to much money on hotel, THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE. The staff was helpfull and we did not encounter any problem. And by the way, the rooftop bar is very pleasant ."

38,1865,"Jun 9 2009 	Great Choice for a Stay in Manhattan (without breaking the bank!)	La Quinta Inn Manhattan is a surprisingly good Hotel in the midst of Koreatown in NYC, near Penn Station, several subway lines, Empire State, 5th Ave, etc . . .This Hotel is not expensive (for NYC, anyway) but the best is that it has not that &quot;cheap&quot; feeling that other Hotels in its price range sometimes have (It appears to be a recent renovation/construction).Front Desk personnel and porter were very helpful; I was assigned room 508 (single King-Size bed); a large one for Manhattan, very large bathroom, room and bathroom very clean. Excellent (really!) mattress and good linens.Fast Wi-Fi Internet in the rooms. An in-room safe that worked!A potentially bad point is that this room is almost in the middle of the corridor, in front of the elevators; acoustic isolation is not particularly good, one can hear the elevator (not very important, as by themselves they are not noisy) and the people transiting through the corridor. If you are a light sleeper (which I am not), ask for a room at the ends of the corridor. And, speaking about the elevators, the building has only two, slow, elevators. Sometimes you need a little bit of patience to use them.A good brakfeast is offered; the hotel has a restaurant and a fitness room on the premises, but I have not used them.All in all, a very good option for a stay in Manhattan; I will probably stay there again in the future"
39,1865,"Jun 8 2009 	Wish I Known About This Place A Long Time Ago	Stayed one night at the La Quinta for the first time, but it won't be my last. I come into the city via Penn Station, so the location one block away couldn't be beat. Nor could the convenience of having the subway right on the corner. I arrived around noon, left my bag in storage, and went on about my way. When I returned check-in was fast and friendly, with the clerk saving me another ten percent by inquiring if I have an Auto Club membership. So remember to show your card and save a few more dollars. My 6th floor room, even though it was across from the ice machine, was very quiet. The queen-sized bed was incredibly comfortable - my next mattress will definitely be memory foam. Everything was spotless. The AC worked well on a hot day, the water pressure was amazing, and the bathroom was a nice size for NYC. One complaint, though, was the placement of the toilet right next to the sink. While it was great to find a bathroom sink in NYC that actually had a counter top (most are pedastal sinks, with no room to place your toiletries), someone didn't do their measuring, because the end of the countertop jabs you in the ribs while you're trying to do your business. I am not an overly large female, so I can't imagine how a large man or any overweight person would fare. Other than that, I was pleased with the room. Didn't partake in the continental breakfast, so I can't comment on that, but we did check out the rooftop bar, which was very busy on a Saturday night. The view of the Empire State Building is indeed great, but if you don't like cigarette smoke this might not be the place for you, since smoking was allowed and, at least that night, was very heavy. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back, especially since I got this room for under $100 on a Saturday night in Manhattan, which is just unheard of."
40,1865,"Jun 3 2009 	Great value hotel right in the heart of NYC	Have just come back from 7 nights at La Quinta, West 32nd Street. Room good size. Bathroom fine - constant hot water. Room cleaned daily. Staff helpful and friendly. A big plus was the included breakfast. Only two lifts so a little slow at times but didn't bother us as we were never in a hurry and comfy leather sofas to relax on while waiting. Would definitely recommend this hotel."
41,1865,"Jun 2 2009 	Small but clean	I stayed at this hotel for one night with 2 friends.The room was somewhat small but clean.It's located just behind Empire State Building, in the Korean streets.Good restaurants near, try Korean BBQ, it's delicious.Breakfast (continental) was served downstairs.Be sure to go early because there's a lot of people and not a lot of tables. The cleaning lady was singing opera while cleaning, a bit disturbing."
42,1865,Jun 1 2009 	great location clean	This hotel was CLEAN. A real plus in the city. It is in a great location and is a very good price. The rooms are small but you have everything you need. Bed was very comfortable.
43,1865,"May 30 2009	Brilliant location great service good price.	My son and I stayed here for 5 nights and couldn't have been happier with our choice of hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was clean and comfortable, the location was close to everything, and the price was very reasonable and included free breakfast, free internet and free U.S.A. phone calls, plus free gym and free newspapers. I would recommend this hotel to everyone."
44,1865,"May 28 2009 	Clean comfortable and friendly	We had a really pleasant stay at this very well located hotel. Could walk to most everything. The room was clean and the service friendly. Free Continental Breakfast is adequate and the value is simply amazing for the location. 24 hr restaurant and roof top bar is a bonus. No nickel and diming - everything from business center to wireless internet, gym and domestic long distance calls were absolutely free. Stayed three nights in the heart of New York for $124.99 plus taxes per night. Some reviews mention slow elevators and shady hallways, and I wonder if they had the wrong hotel - we encountered no problems at all."
45,1865,"May 25 2009 	Fantastic hotel in central Manhattan location	A good sized room with continental breakfast included. Easy to get around with a subway stop only half a block away and a short walk to Times Square, Penn Station/Madison Square Garden. A highlight and must do is a visit to the rooftop bar which has a view up to the Empire State building towering overhead (its in the next block). Staff are very helpful and there is an ingenious wheelchair access at the front door."
46,1865,"May 22 2009 	La Quinta Inn Manhattan is a rip off	Our flight was delayed into NY and we arrived at this hotel around 7:00 pm. We had a confirmed late arrival reservation - which was made 3 months prior. When we got there we were told that our reservation was cancelled! They were very unsympathetic towards the situation, even though I showed them the confirmation. They told us our room, however, WOULD be ready by 6 am the next day if we would come back. They offered to find us another room - which they did - for $350 for 8 hours!!! They said it was the ONLY room available in town that evening (which I find hard to believe). Of course, we had to take it. When we came back the next morning, they raised our rates as we were now considered &quot;walk ins&quot;. We requested a room away from the elevators, and our room was put right across from it. They would not work with us, give us our original rate, etc. so we have since put a stop payment on our credit card until they honor at least the price quoted. If you stay at this hotel, make SURE you confirm EVERYTHING up to the last minute. If you stay for the breakfast up to the last five minutes, they shuffle everyone off rudely stating &quot;breakfast is over, you must all leave NOW&quot;. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!"
47,1865,"May 22 2009 	Excellent locationrooms and staff	Room price is very expensive in nyc but this hotel has the best pricing in the city, the location is perfect everything is there around the corner also the staff is very nice and frendly we recommend this hotel to anyone to stay ho I forget to tell you about it is very clean."
48,1865,"May 21 2009 	The hotel was perfect.	The service was perfect. My room was always clean. The people at the front desk are kind. I liked the free morning breakfast. The housekepping very nice and friendly. I was so comfatable beacuse you could play your ipod, they have irons and ironbroads. they also have tv. The bathroom is always clean."
49,1865,"May 20 2009 	Great value great room superb location!	Absolutely wonderful little hotel. Had never heard of it before. Apparently the chain is from the South. Booked it for the very reasonable rates and it had fairly good reviews. Turned out to be a very quaint and charming hotel. Really homely, courteous staff, very clean. great find. Walking distance to many sights and locations. Flat iron district and restaurants within 5-7 mins. Times square and theatres/restaurants in 10. East or West Village in a brisk 20 mins. Great shopping as well!"
50,1865,"May 18 2009 	Excellent Value and Location	The La Quinta Manhattan was a great value with nice rooms. The staff was very friendly. If you're looking for a hotel with a decent rate, and also a nice place to stay, try this one. The complimentary breakfast was filling."
51,1865,"May 13 2009 	Just what we needed!	Stayed for 3 nights in room 1111 and loved it! 2 Queen beds and I thought the room was huge for New York. Two 30something girls with lots of luggage and plenty of room for it. Great area for shopping and sightseeing, close to subway and Penn St. I would stay her again and recommend it to everyone!"
52,1865,"May 12 2009 	Great location good price	My boyfriend and I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times. Last time we stayed there, about 2 years ago, I found hairs on the towels. We didn't came back since.This weekend we decided to spend the night in NY. After calling several hotels in the TS area and finding them too expensive, 200+, we decided to go back to la Quinta. Yes, we found the lowest rate of the hotels in the area, and quite difererently to last time, the people in Front Desk were very kind. The complimentary continental breakfast this time was also better than before, more food to choose from, including fruit, yogourt, cereals, bagels and more. A bit boring having to wait for a table cuz the room was full. Rooms: Average, comfortable. Beds: Comfortable too, we had a queen size. Now, if your wondering if i found any hairs this time, the answer is yes, I found a hair in a towel again! So, the main issue here is the cleanliness of the hotel. It's a pity cuz with the location and low rates this would be perfect for people on the budget."
53,1865,"May 12 2009 	simply awesome!	Where can you possibly get a room for two, in NYC, with breakfast, for the absolutely stunning price of $112.49. Taxes extra, of course. Now the really good part - the rooms are very decent sized for New York, but get this - memory foam beds. Did you know these beds are bug proof - yea - absolutely! This was one of our concerns we had, and when we found this one feature - we knew we could not stay anywhere else. So here we are right next to the Empire State building, across the street from Macys and a short walk to Times Square - what a deal at a steal! The Hotel has a roof top bar (phenomenal view)and a 24 hour restaurant (Korean) too. The room was clean though not the most modern, but it had a laptop sized safe, wireless internet (anywhere in the hotel-no charge), an Ipod player on the bedside and the staff were just amazingly helpful. The breakfast room was a bid crowded but we got ourselves a bagel and coffee to go every morning - the breakfast attendant ws a pleasant felow and would happily bag our breakfast for us every morning. Great restaurants/eateries all around, all kinds of prices from $5 to $30 a meal depending on the ambience and whether you had a drink or not-so something for every budget! I would recommend this for anyone coming to New York City on a budget and yet wanting to be able to walk to everything."
54,1865,"May 10 2009 	Ultra convenient location with all the basics	Attending a wedding in SoHo, I added a few days to my trip to see family and friends--and a bit of New York City. The location was so convenient. I had taken the NJ Transit train from Newark Airport to Penn Station, and then I could walk (aided by wheeled luggage) to the hotel. On 32nd Street between Fifth Ave. and Broadway, the hotel was a short walk to several subway lines and a PATH station. It was easy to get to a Broadway theater, shopping, and the NYC transit museum in Brooklyn. It's almost around the block from the Empire State Building.I'm a fan of La Quinta Inns and Suites because they have all the basics I want at a reasonable price. This one lived up to my expectations (including price, $99 AAA rate for a great location in Manhattan). The free breakfast buffet was handy. This is not a bare bones buffet. They even had hard boiled eggs. The fitness center wasn't fancy, but the exercise bicycle was fine. At the small business center off the lobby, I was able to use the Internet confirm that my flight was on time just before I left the hotel.The room was not as spacious as the one on my previous LaQuinta stay (Davenport, Iowa) but it didn't feel cramped for one person. One minor (and solvable) problem: I was there for some very cold days in January, and I had to run the shower a few minutes before I got hot water."
55,1865,"May 9 2009 	Good Budget Place	Considering that accommodation costs in NYC can be as high the skyscrapers there, this place was very affordable. Travelling alone, I didn't need a lot of space. The room was a little cramped but the bed was very comfortable and the toilet facilities more than adequate. The only significant problem was a lack of hot water between midnight and 7 am. Breakfast was reasonable although sharing a table was necessary most mornings because the room was small.Location wise, this hotel was in the middle of Little Korea and some of the restaurants there are open 24 hours so food's never a problem. It's also only a block away from the Empire State Building and within walking distance of Times Square. Other than that, the 34th St-Herald Sq subway station is only a short walk away and using the city buses is also a good option if a little time is spent studying the routes - but have a Metrocard - it's so useful."
56,1865,"May 7 2009 	Expected more	Having stayed in the Red Roof Inn, just over the road and part of the Apple Core Hotels group, I recently booked into the La Quinta. Standards in this hotel are a lot lower, and staff didn't seem all that bothered about helping.The room was small. One bed in the middle, and literally just enough room to open the door and move around the bed. Was offered a room with a view of the Empire State Building, but declined when I was told that it would be an extra $30 per night for the same sandard room, so basically paying purely for the view!Was told breakfast was between 7-10am, but when going down at 9:20am, it seemed pretty much everything apart from bagels were gone, and no staff around to ask if it would be replenished, so went elsewhere for breakfast. Room was clean, but small. In a good location. I advise very highly of booking way in advance, as on-the-day prices are extortionate, $179+tax for a room that'll cost you $109inc when booking via a 3rd party website. Company also has no customer loyalty. Having stayed in Apple Core hotels my last 5 or 6 visits to NYC, my trip was extended a few days but the hotel were not willing to do anything regarding the sky-high prices for the last two days to meet somewhere in-between what I'd paid for the rest, so stayed elsewhere."
57,1865,"May 4 2009 	The Most Horrible Experience In All My Travels	The hotel that I had confirmed was over-sold, and they transfered me to this hotel. La Quinta Manhattan in NY City put me in a room on the top floor; it was apparenlty a Suite room - this floor had a pub/bar on the floor - next to 5-6 rooms!!!It was noisy, boisterous, and I did not get to sleep until 4am in the morning.Worse of all, the staff to whom I complained to on the phone just did not care.When I asked ot see the Manager in the morning(unfortunatley it was a Sunday) - of course he was not on Duty, and apparently gave instructions to his staff that he would not answer to customers unless the &quot;hotel burnt down&quot; - do much for customer satisfaction!!!"
58,1865,"May 1 2009 	Big value for little bucks in NYC!!	I just ran up to NYC for an overnight trip to visit with some other out-of-town friends. I wanted to find a place that was inexpensive and in a good location, but wasn't a hole or a hostel . I found it at La Quinta! The room was clean and the bed was quite comfy. It had an iron, 2 luggage racks, a safe, a hair dryer, a big TV, iPod dock/ clock radio and a phone in the bathroom. It was hot as all heck the day of my visit, so I cranked the AC, which worked just fine (thankfully!!!). These might be considered basics to some, but you'd miss them if you needed them and they weren't there. The bathroom was clean with plenty of towels and extra TP. They even called me 10 minutes after I settled in to see if everything was OK. Now, the room was smallish (no surprise there) and there was a view of the other wing of the hotel out of my window (no big deal). It was a little dark and the bathroom had a swinging door, but, for my $98/night AAA rate I got a continental breakfast, free newspaper, clean room, private bath, 1 block from Broadway, and a short walk from subways and major shopping/dining. The employees were pleasant and helpful. I signed up for the La Quinta rewards program and I'd definitely stay there again."
59,1865,"Apr 29 2009 	great hotel great staff great location	When I saw rooms 1005/07, it reminded me of the old &quot;where's the beef?&quot; commercial. The rooms were tiny, maybe 250 sq. ft. I did look in other rooms, there are larger ones. Looks like hotel had a makeover, it was spotless. No foul odors/ stains, etc ( they supposedly fine u for smoking in places where it is forbidden) Ventilation was good, and it was relatively quiet despite the ice machine in the hall. Views WON'T take your breath away, you are in the shadow of the Empire State Bldg. Unlike many NYC hotels, U DON'T HAVE TO SHARE A BATHROOM W OTHERS, u get a FULL BATHROOM IN YOUR ROOM. At no extra cost u get a great tv w lots of channels, i pod dock on the radio, coffee maker, blow dryer, toiletries, safe, iron/board, 3 phones in room, even in the bathroom?? They have vm, no charge to dial out. WIFI is free , the computers in the basement were always in use when I went by after the free continental breakfast. I ASSUME there is no charge to use them. U can check in/out, get boarding pass at a kiosk in lobby where they have free NY Post/ USA Today copies. Small gym had a Bowflex (broken) and cardio machines. No pool. There is a concierege desk and a small convenience store. There is better store down the block, Jack's 99. Lots of stuff there, much of it &lt;$1. No restaurant, only vending. U R in Koreatown, eateries are all Korean, walk a block or so, u will find lots of other choices. There is a rooftop bar on 13th floor, has a skylight where u can c the top of the Empire State Bldg. They don't own the parking lot, it is $30/ night!! Ouch!! Laundry service has a fee. Looks like place is ADA compliant, they lower a ramp to let u in the front entrance. Elevators are small/ slow, stairs are not in a creepy/ dirty staircase ,they are a good option.U can easily walk to many places in NYC from here, area was safe. Subway stops r a block away in either direction. Costs $2 a ride w free transfers as long as u don't leave station. Uu can buy a Metro card and add value to it, or get a day pass for $7.50. If u have a group and u r not going far, cabs can be a better deal since 4 ride for the price of 1. Penn Station/MSG, 2 blocks away. Catch Amtrak/ Long Island RR here. To get to JFK, take LIRR to Jamaica station (25 mins) transfer to AIRTRAIN . Total cost is about $10,on off peak hrs. Even if u have bags, this is fairly easy. Getting to LGA, is harder if u have bags. I took subway to 125th St, transferred to M60 bus. U can get to EWR from Penn too. Get to NJ on PATH via 33rd St station around the block. There are buses to all airports too. Grand Central ( beautiful bldg.) a mile away, $6 cab ride. Metro North trains go to NJ, up the Hudson, and Conn. Go at off peak time up the Hudson, great day trip , beautiful river views at a low price. Got great AAA rate for hotel( need to show them the card) it was &lt; $100, taxes raise bill 15% . Join the rewards program, it's free. U can redeem points 4 future stays at other LQ hotels. U can easily pay 2x as much and get less elsewhere. I don't think u will get your own bathroom and a good breakfast and many other extras in a great, safe location ,w a great staff for this price anywhere else in mid town."
60,1865,"Apr 23 2009	Not what we expected	Although this hotel was convenient for it's location, the rooms were small, the bathroom was small,our room smelled like smoke and we were unable to open the windows. We arrived with a large group and for future group travelers this is not the hotel for you. This place cannot accomadate groups that large. The lobby was very small and the elevators were slow and most of us had to take the stairs which were inconvenient given the amount of luggage we had. To top it all off a few of the parents left with rashes from bed bugs. Definately would not stay here again."
61,1865,"Apr 17 2009 	Always Reliable	This was my 4th or 5th stay at this hotel, and I will continue to keep coming back. The location is ideal: right on W. 32nd Street, walking distance from Penn Station (if you don't have too much luggage), and the bus from JFK and LaGuardia will drop you off right in front. You are literally 1/2 block from the subway, and centrally located to everything you need in Manhattan. Great shopping is 2 blocks away: Macy's, H&amp;M, Gap, Manhattan Mall, Lush, Daffy's, and so on.The hotel itself is very pleasant. They now have those memory foam mattresses, so the beds are very comfortable. The rooms are small, but keep in mind this is Manhattan, where space is at a premium. The maids did a great job - even looked for a ring I'd lost. The small workout room isn't much, but it's right there and convenient. There are 3 or 4 computers in the business center, and a printer, so you can surf the web, print out directions or boarding passes, etc. And there's wireless internet in your room, along with a safe in the closet for your valuables.The breakfast is more than adequate. No, there's no hot food but there are bagels, toast, donuts, cereal, instant oatmeal, fruit (generally apples &amp; bananas), yogurt. And the staff keeps refilling so you don't have to worry about them being out of something. They also have daily newspapers in the breakfast room.The staff is always friendly and helpful. Checkout is a relatively late (for NY) noon, and they will store your luggage for you after you check out. My room was cleaned every day. My only complaint is they don't give you the option to save water &amp; reuse your towels. If you have AAA, make sure to ask for the discount if you haven't already booked with the discount. I actually found the best price on the LaQuinta website."
62,1865,"Apr 13 2009 	Room was roomy for NYC!	A friend and I stayed here one night so we could catch a play on Braodway (&quot;Mary Stuart&quot; - OUTSTANDING!) . As former NYC-ers, we were familiar with the city and just needed a place for the night that was inexpensive (by NYC hotel standards!) and within walking distance to the theatre district. Although the neighborhood this hotel is located in is not one I'd spend much time in (no character), it's close enough to the theatre district that it didn't matter.Rather than book online after seeing the nice reviews here on tripadvisor, I called the hotel to inquire about a non-smoking room w/ 2 queens. They gave me the room at the same price as the single NS queen room. The beds were VERY comfortable! And the room was surprisingly spacious for NYC. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. We easily stored our luggage so we could walk about the city. My only criticism of my stay would be the &quot;complimentary&quot; breakfast (they can call it complimentary but it's always figured into the price you pay). The breakfast area was overcrowded (possibly due to the holiday weekend). The location of items made it difficult to reach certain things. For example, the coffee and juice located in the corner - everyone crowded around those two items making it almost impossible to reach any other item located on either side. I would suggest locating drinks at the end or in another area altogether. Also, many items ran out at about 9AM and were not replenished (i.e. bananas). Having only one coffee spigot meant that it was hard to get one cup of coffee let alone a refill. And the quality could barely be considered &quot;coffee&quot; it was soooooo weak! Had to go to a Starbucks for a real cup of coffee!"
63,1865,"Apr 8 2009 	Stay here!	Great help! Nice lobby help, towels late, but with honest apology &quot;I forgot!&quot;, and cleaning staff found and returned a scarf I left (after I returned for it)..I wish the free breakfast included what was listed on website, no hot food at all, but I was full each day. SMALL room!Location great!I paid about $120 a night."
64,1865,"Apr 5 2009 	I was really pleased with my stay there.	My small room was cozy, reasonably priced, and appointed with everything I needed. Everything was clean and up-to-date. Continental breakfast was well stocked and pleasant. And the location is truly convenient, near Empire State Building, near Macy's, near Penn station and near 3 subway lines. I would definitely stay there again."
65,1865,"Apr 3 2009 	If you go to New York stay here	The staff in La Quinta are extremely helpful &amp; friendly, nothing is too much bother for them. Not only did they book us in at short notice after a disastrous episode at the Holiday Inn at Newark airport, they went out of their way to make our stay both welcoming and enjoyable. The room was clean comfortable with everything you need for a short stay. You can leave your valuables in the safe without worrying about them.La Quinta is situated within a few steps of the Empire State Building and Times Square, Broadway, Madison Sq Garden &amp; Macy's are a few minutes away.The only small annoyance was we could not open the window, but it had air conditioning so it wasn't a real problem. I have already reccommended the La Quinta to friends."
66,1865,"Mar 25 2009 	Happy Ending	I'm always a fan of Apple Core Hotel as I found they offer very reasonable price and good service in Manhattan. This is my first stay in La Quinta however. I did start with a not so nice experience upon check-in. The staff who checked me in told me that I had made a double on-line reservation and will be charged twice! (Should he not tell me about this, I probably won't check my credit card bill). It is actually beyond his authority to cancel the double booking for me. He is so helpful to provide information for me to communicate with the General Manager. After some days of investigation, the General Manager has given me the refund and promised to offer me upgrade in next stay."
67,1865,"Mar 20 2009 	Wonderful location! Great service.	We were in NYC for the St Pat's Day parade. We had a lovely time at this hotel. It was convienient to everything. When we checked in the front desk staff were very friendly and courteous. We were offered a front or rear room. We opted for the rear so it would be quiet and we weren't disappointed. The view was of another building but that didn't bother us at all. It was very quiet and didn't hear any noise at all at night. The only trouble we had was when we went to get our car from the parking garage they told us it was not part of the discount with this hotel. My husband told them that when we parked our car we were told that it was by the attendant, he ended up getting us the discount anyways. Be sure that you ask specifically which parking lot is the one that offers the discount. That was not the hotel's fault. Our room was small but very comfortable and spotless. The bed is out of this world. The shower was great! Wonderful water pressure and the water was hot. We didn't eat the free breakfast so I can't comment on that. The high speed was okay but a little sporatic, but that happens at all hotels. I will definately stay here again when we return to NYC."
68,1865,"Mar 14 2009 	central location in Manhattan but...	We spend 4 days at the hotel for a little stop-by from Germany . Basically the hotel is quite ok because the location is so central that you can reach everything within 15 min in Manhattan by using subway. Unless you are not stying at the 12th floor next to the ice-machine you also will be able to have a good night. So avoid the 12th floor - or even all equal numbered floors where ice-machines are located - as i heared (but maybe I am wrong). Breakfast was quite moderate, kind of coffee-to-go atmosphere but very convenient.The cleanliness was also good, maids made a good job.But now the little shady side: we got a little subtenant in our room: a mouse. This one entered the trash box and also the handbag of my girlfriend because there were some almonds located. We were disturbed in sleeping during the last night because of the action of this animal. Perhaps they will do sth. about it - at least we gave the hint at the reception and to the maid.Nevertheless we would recommend this hotel even because of this little discomfort - it was quite avarage and compared to european standards between 2* and 3*."
69,1865,"Mar 13 2009 	Would definitly stay there again!	My boyfriend and I stayed at La Quinta from March 5th through March 8th and had a very good experience. After reading some of the past reviews I have to admit I was a little weary but was pleasantly suprised! The staff were very friendly. The room was a little small, but very clean. The bed was comfortable and you really cannot beat the location! I really liked the fact that after we checked out we were able to store our bags there while we finished up our exploration of the city. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a great deal along with great location!"
70,1865,"Feb 26 2009 	great price great location	La Quinta was in a great location, about 1/2 block from Herald Square and the subway. $131 for a room with 2 queen beds can't be beat. The beds were very comfortable temperpeautic mattresses too! The free breakfast and internet added to the value and if you looked out the window and WAAAY up high, you could see the Empire State Building."
71,1865,"Feb 16 2009 	Great Experience	The La Quinta Inn Manhattan is a very good hotel with an excellent location and great value. Some may complain about the size of the room, but many hotels in NYC are small. I stayed at more expensive hotels in the city and overall the La Quinta was better! Clean, safe, and great staff! Very nice rooftop bar! Been there in the past, and the bartender is a nice guy with a good sense of humor. The Free Bright Side Breakfast is also a plus!"
72,1865,"Feb 14 2009 	2 stars not 3	I stayed at many La Quintas across the US, but this has to be the worst one. It was marked as a three star (Expedia, priceline) but I would give it a two. The lobby is nice and it is in a fabulous location...easy to jump on a subway, by the Empire State Bldg, etc... BUT I was dissapointed of the size of the room....very small....and it's overall condition...very outdated...tiny bathroom...not to mention the sink was held up by a 2by4. The pluses were....nice staff, decent breakfast, and LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION...loved getting pizza on the nearby corner @1am and walking around the town. At $250 a night...this was considered a bargain for Manhattan???...maybe a local could steer you in a better direction!"
73,1865,"Jan 27 2009 	Very nice!!	I stayed at La Quinta from Dec 28 to Jan 4. I was with my daughter and a cousin. When I booked it , they didnt have a double bed room available, so we had to stay in a king bed room with a rollaway bed, until a bigger room was available for us.The first room was clean and comfortable, even though a little bit small for the three of us, but then , a few days later we were able to move to the other room, with two double beds. It was a big and nice room.It was a bit dark because it was in the 2nd floor and it didnt get much light from outside the window, but it was ok anyway.The breakfast was good , as usual. Ive already been to other hotels from the same company, and they are all very similar. I guess ' La Quinta' is the only one of the five hotels that wasnt renovated, but the rooms are nice and clean.The location is fabulous! You have the Empire State Building, stores like Victoria Secret, Gap, the Manhattan Mall, Macy's just a few steps away from the hotel.There is a nice deli called ' Speedy's' where we had many meals.The staff was always very friendly.When I was trying to book a room by email, the manager was very thoughtful , replying all my emails promptly.Everything went well during our stay there."
74,1865,"Jan 20 2009 	Rooms don't seem clean	location is good if you want to be close to Time Square and the Empire State Building. It is in the middle of Koreatown. Personally, I prefer more residential neighborhoods of NYC (e.g. Chelsea, Upper West Side).The staff was nice- allowed us to check in early (at 12:30pm).Our room did not smell clean. The bathroom had no heat- it was freezing in the morning. The bathroom also looked like it had not been updated in 10-15 years. I would not stay here again."
75,1865,"Jan 17 2009 	Best Deal I've ever experienced in a Manhattan Hotel	Best location. Friendliest stuff I've ever experienced. Clean room, though small. Best deal I could have ever expected for a 1 night stay with spouse &amp; 2 kids, where evth. needs to be as quick and close to the hotel as possible."
76,1865,"Jan 14 2009 	Not Bad!	Stayed here in May 08. had a room on the top floor, pretty much right opposite the bar, so it was quite noisy at night, but not too bad. Breakfast was a welcome bonus. The room was smallish, and even though we asked for a smoking room, and were told it was a smoking room, there was no ashtray. Also, it was very warm in NYC when we were there an no A/C made the room very hot. But a pretty good location, with a subway nearby to get to where you need to be. One word of warning, the concierge/gifr shop staff was dire, and gave us the wrong info on more than one occasion. For the price, I would stay here again, but there are better hotels in NYC than this."
77,1865,"Jan 12 2009 	OK	The LaQuinta Manhattan is an &quot;ok&quot; hotel. Location is &quot;ok&quot;, not the greatest area but there is a subway stop right at the corner of the block so that makes it really easy to get to where you want to be. The rooms are &quot;ok&quot;, pretty small but not terrible, however our non-smoking room really smelled like smoke. The breakfast is &quot;ok&quot;, although any free breaksfast in NY is a plus, this is very basic: cold cereal, bagels, fruit. All in all, for the price it's ok."
78,1865,Jan 11 2009	Great location for reasonable price )	Great location for reasonable pricecozy and clean rooms you can walk to many famous sight seeingsempire state building is next to you also breakfest is good reason to stay in this hotelcoz most of the hotels in NY doesn't include it in pricea lot of korean restourants on the 32 streetcoz it's called korea way also pizzas and buritos not so far
79,1865,"Dec 26 2008 	Nice Hotel	This is a very nice hotel rooms are a bit small but clean and well kept, early check in was nice too ,the guy working the breakfast room was very rude , I had taken some items from the breakfast table up to our room , my wife and daughter were getting ready to go, when i went back down for coffee the guy asked me if i could read, at first i was like what did he say to me then he said you cant see the sign it says dont bring food items to room , 1st off Ican read and 2nd I didnt see the sign , I just looked at him like what an [--] well other then that stay was good"
80,1865,"Dec 17 2008 	Great Hotel	We checked arrived at 1130am and the hotel allowed us to check-in early gave us a room that looked directly at the Empire State Building beautiful at night. The only thing wrong with this room was there was a ice machine right outside of the door so every time someone got ice we heard it all night long. We changed rooms the next day got another room with a nice view. Hotel provides a very nice breakfast which saves you money on one meal a day. Beds are VERY comfortable, didn't like the window in the shower felt like I was showering in front of all of New York. Front desk was very accomodating and friendly had no problems will definitely stay again and recommend this hotel highly. Very clean and great location subway station very close."
81,1865,Dec 16 2008 	Nice	A relatively clean hotel. Somewhat small room. Good breakfast. Helpful staff. Great location. We would return.
82,1865,Dec 13 2008 	Cheap for NYC	Stayed here in March 08. This hotel had the best rate &lt;200/night for any hotel in the Manhattan area. Very close to Times Square and Penn Station. Opened the window and saw the side of the Empire State building. The rooms are old and needs updating but well maintained. The free breakfast is OK but the eating room gets crowded. Good to have a outdoor rooptop bar with a great view of the Empire State Building in the night.
83,1865,"Dec 9 2008 	Fabulous find	What a wonder is all I can say. I researched this trip for a while, wanting to get as many features as I could and pay as litle as possible. My girl friend and I wanted to get out for a few days to New York and were amazed to see the prices. But the diference in price between 3 stars in Times Sq or 3 stars a ten minute walk away, right next to Macy's and the Empire State building was baffling. We stayed the day after Thansgiving for 2 nights at a phenomenal 154.99 a night for a queen room at the La Quinta for the two of us - with breakfast if you please. I can go on and on about the location but you have to be there to feel the vibrant crowds, the multitude of restaurants and bars, the access to the subway system, and everything happening there. Nice clean room, free wireless internet, free calls within the US, restaurant, roof-top bar, business center access and exercise room all at no additional charge - the La Quinta Manhattan is the way to go!"
84,1865,"Dec 9 2008 	Fantastic location ! :)	We came back today after spending 3 nights in this hotel. We had a great time, the location is the best, the subway is right outside, along with 5. avenue and many other shopping streets! The staff were very polite and helpful, and the cleaning lady was really cute, I think her name was India? :)The breakfast included was nice to have when we woke up early and starving! Bagels, tea, donuts, cereals +++... All you need!Our room was ok in size, and the bed was comfy with clean and fresh linen. We will definately be back!"
85,1865,"Nov 30 2008 	Appalling conditions	What a dump...avoid at all costs. This hotel and staff is worst I have ever come across. No water, a broken sink, no heat, pubic hair on floor and bed, and a short walk on the carpet turned my girlfriends socks black. The hotel staff could not be more incompetent and rude. Do yourself a favor and sleep on the street first. I hear the dumpster near 32nd and Broadway has a nicer view than the dirty massage parlor directly across from my window."
86,1865,"Nov 21 2008 	Mediocre	Very mediocre hotel; scruffy and dirty reception area, small and old rooms with nothing in terms of views.Amongst the cheaper rates you can in Manhattan, though, short of going to a hostel.Good location right next to the Empire State Building."
87,1865,"Nov 17 2008 	Check your Bank statements after your stay	The room &amp; hotel was clean and the breakfast was edible. The location was great just two blocks from Madison Square Garden and a short walk to Times Square and everywhere else. The one thing that did bother us was the staff. We were a group of four splitting a room, each couple got there at different times. I had reserved the room over the phone and was told I would not be charged for the room until I checked out on Friday. We were all planning on just paying cash that day. My friend and his girlfriend got there first and was asked to present a credit card since the one with the reservation was not there yet, no big deal he told them do not charge this card just hold it. I got there and was given a key, nothing was mentioned of my card # they had. Also when we got there the elevator was broken.I understand mechanical things have their problem, but Ive heard of this happening a lot there and I had to walk up 5 storiesnot a happy camper. They soon fixed it. At 11:45pm my friend with the other credit card was called down to the front desk because his card was denied. THANKFULLY it was because at that time I was out getting some food and decided to check my balance and was missing $275 (the price of the room with taxes and a SECRET $50 FEE they charge you incase you steal something, break something etc.thats understandable I just wish someone had mentioned that. ANYWAYS, I went back to the hotel and wanted to know why $275 was taken out of my account they swore up and down it was not them who took the money out of my account, I asked for the internet user name and password to check my statements and told them I would be back down. I got up to my room and there was a problem with the Internet it could not connect for some reason. So we just let it be.In the morning they were still denying the fact they took money out and they had just ran the cards to insure they were legit, my friend who was with me works at my bank and KNOWS hotels are only supposed to hold $1 up to $25, they didnt seem to like hearing that fact. While my friend was arguing with them about where they got the right to charge my card and if they had already charged my card why did they need an additional credit card number from him at 11:45pm? Why couldnt they have waited until the morning? All four of us overheard the receptionist say the card went through or something along those lines. Needless to say the argument came to a screeching halt and we left. The hotel was great the service was nothing special."
88,1865,"Nov 7 2008 	Comfortable and Friendly	I travel to NY on a regular basis and continue to struggle with finding a reasonable rate for a reasonable room. This is the closest that I have come. The room sizes are similar to other NY hotels (small) and could use some updating. That aside, its clean, comfortable and the staff is excellent, Specifcially Ronica and Marjerie who work the front desk in the am. They are terrific. As mentioned this is not the Ritz, but it is conveniently located, reasonably priced (for NYC) and comfortable."
89,1865,"Nov 1 2008	Another Great Stay	We have just arrived home having stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. This is our 4th year in a row staying in this hotel. As a group of girls on a weekend shopping trip it fits the bill perfectly. We have stayed in many different rooms over the years and each time have found them sufficient for our needs. Having stayed in two other hotels locally the rooms in manhattan for this price are generally small but the rooms at La Quinta are well equiped and clean. The staff at reception are always polite and helpful and on one occassion when my mobile phone charger didnt work they searched until they found me one that was compatible to my phone for me to use for the duration of my stay.This year on our annual visit when we arrived the room we were given only had one bed and was very small. When we returned to reception to explain that we had booked a room with two beds we were told that there had been a problem with the online booking system but it was since sorted. We had booked the room through a website rather than with the hotel directly which we normally do, so perhaps this was partly the problem. The manager on duty that dealt with us was called Victor and was most pleasant and professional. He told that there was no other room available that night but they could offer us another room and promptly took us to the 14th floor. The room we were given was what they called the penthouse! Although it still had just one bed they promptly offered to set up another bed for us. The room in New York standards was huge. It had a very large bed with ample space for a second twin bed and a sofa/table and chairs. The bathroom had a large double walk in shower, jacuzzi and double washand basins, although the room is quiet outdated and the drawer units had the knobs missed on two drawers it was perfect for girls who have a lot of suitcases! The downside of this room is that it is located right next door to the bar, which is open till 1am. However as we never planned on being in bed before that hour it didnt effect us in any way. One night we were in the room before the bar closed and it was very noisy so I doubt that you would get any sleep before the 1am closing time, but if you come all the way to New York they why would you want to be in bed early in a city that never sleeps?!Breakfast is included in the price of the room and is again totally acceptable. Throughout our stay Victor enquired as to how we were enjoying our trip and if the room was satisfactory. We were never charged anything extra for the upgrade which was greatly appreciated.We have recommended this hotel to many people who have also stayed and all commented on its cleanliness and location. It is only a short stroll from Penn Station and most importantly Macys! There are also some lovely places to eat nearby to suit all tastes. While the rooms are generally on the small size they are no smaller than other hotels in this location and represent good value for money. The hotel also offer a shuttle bus to and from the airport which is a lot cheaper than getting a taxi.No doubt next year when we are again planning our trip to New York we will again be staying with La Quinta."
90,1865,"Oct 28 2008 	Great stay at La Quinta	The La Quinta was recommended in the economy accomodations section of the Fromers travel guide that I purchased. My girlfriend and I were on a shopping/sightseeing getaway and we were really pleased with the hotel. It was in a great central location 1/2 block from Broadway and close to the subway and walking distance to lots of attractions. Clean rooms, comfortable bed and compared to other hotels we looked at it was economical but not short on style. We were on the 8th floor facing the street and did not hear any street noise in the night. The continental breakfast that was included in the price was the basics but more than adequate. I would stay here again. The Martinique around the corner on 32nd and Broadway is a great place to eat. Good portions and by New York prices reasonable. Burgers, paninis etc $10. Open 24 hours."
91,1865,"Oct 27 2008 	I thought about not writing this at all . . .	It's ridiculously hard to find a decent budget hotel in Manhattan, especially one that is only a couple of blocks from Penn Station, so I was holding my breath as I walked to the LaQuinta. It's in the middle of a block of 34th St. that is called &quot;Korea Way,&quot; literally surrounded by dozens of Korean restaurants, karaoke bars, spas, not to mention a Pinkberry on one side and their &quot;tangy frozen yogurt&quot; competitor Red Mango. The price was right, the small lobby was lovely, the room was tiny but clean and well-maintained, and the AC worked. What more could I ask? I really did think about keeping this secret to myself, because all the inexpensive hotels shoot up in price as their business increases -- but what the hey, why not share the wealth! If you're budget minded, and care about cleanliness (but not so much about lovely decor) this is the place for you."
92,1865,"Oct 20 2008 	Everything you need you have!	I stayed at La Quinta Manhattan long almost 20 days, with my sister, and I surely would go back there next time.No luxury hotel, but nice and comfortable: you find what you expected to find (more than the Manhattan' standard). Overall, everything you need to feel good, there you find it: new and very comfortable beds, good breakfast, free internet, free calls in USA, and something else. As a plus, the location is absolutely perfect.Their mot is &quot;We give you everyting you need, and something more&quot;: well, it's absolutely true!General Manager has been very friendly and collaborative with us.Very good experience.Maria Cristina Piazza - Florence, Italy"
93,1865,"Oct 9 2008 	Worst La Quinta I have stayed at	I was looking for a mid-town name-brand hotel for under $300 (barely) per night. When La Quinta fit this criteria I figured it would work for me. I was wrong. Here is the short list of things wrong on my 2 night stay...1. No hot water first morning at 6:30 AM (I was told to let it run a few minutes...I did this for over 5 minutes and all I got was lukewarm water). At 7:00 AM the hot water showed up, but too late.2. Tub drain slow...took my lukewarm shower standing in 3 inches of water3. Cordless phone handset did not work. Speaker phone worked.4. Message button on desk phone not programmed correctly. Called front desk and told to dial &quot;40&quot; for messages (why have a &quot;message&quot; button?)5. Clock/radio (iHome) time not set correctly. Apparently no easy way for customer to adjust.6. TV remote control - power button did not work. Had to get out of bed to turn TV on/off.7. Room very small8. Front desk staff spoke English as a second language...difficult to understand instructions for messages, internet access, etc.9. Limited breakfast choices (compared to other La Quintas)10. Water in toilet cloudy with sediment on first day11. Insufficient electrical outlets around desk and in room in general12. Given nonsense promotional welcome package that included commercial items of limited interest. Apparently this La Quinta were being paid to distribute these for the vendor. This was not a La Quinta promotion.I will not stay at this La Quinta again. It does not meet La Quinta standards. Price not worth it."
94,1865,"Sep 14 2008	Good for price	This is an adequate hotel for a reasonable NYC price. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was clean and adequate if all you want is a place to sleep. Breakfast was fine. The rooftop bar is a lively place. The only negative is that it is located on Korea Street - not the cleanest street in the world but perfectly safe. It is 1/2 block from the subway, close to Penn Station and many tourist sites."
95,1865,"Sep 9 2008 	Good value for money	Helpful staff and convenient midtown location.Free breakfast, pleasant and clean rooms. The closets could be bigger though! Loads of Korean restaurants around."
96,1865,"Sep 3 2008	Fabulous memory foam beds	I have stayed at this hotel before but they have recently upgraded their beds to this new memory foam mattress which is simply heaven to sleep on. After 2 nights on this mattress, all our travel aches and pains were gone - it was just amazing. Ofcourse the reason we come back to this particular establishment again and again is the absolutely marvellous location - right in the heart of midtown - close to shops, and the sights - everything's a 5-10 minute walk except the village which is a quick cab ride."
97,1865,"Aug 31 2008 	Niky 	Just want to say to everybody this hotel is allfull,we ll never come back.The stuff is unfriendly ,the service terribly ,the breakfast restaurant is very ,very small and breakfast is not enough for nobody .For this price 260$ per night we eat in the paper plates and drunk cups .It s ridiculous.The duties to the doorman are to help to the customers with the laguage ,but even after our riquest he did not help us.In New York are many amasing hotels but this is the worst we ever see."
98,1865,"Aug 30 2008 	Terrible experience	When I am reading the reviews of people who gave this hotel higher rank than 2, then I am curious, if they had ever had been in the same hotel...If you want to have a clean, ok-sized room - STAY AWAY AT ALL COST. You can trust me on this one - I am on the road for over 150 nights/year and usually get normal hotels (not just 5 stars).NEVER AGAIN!!!Here is why: my company had booked few rooms for our group, while we were coming back from a meeting. We had arrived about 10pm. The check-in was ok (just ok), but when I entered my room, I was completely in shock! The room was small (basically I had no room to put my suitcase, so it spent the night with my on the bed) stinky - trust me: it had not been renovated for ages! The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen in my life. Toilet was facing the wall, so I could barely fit on it (with my head on the opposite wall). I usually do not do that, but I used disinfectant wipes to clean the bathroom (gosh, ugly!!!). I was also concerned to touch the floor with my feet - I threw away my hotel shoes after the night there. I usually have no problems with sleeping - except having vent shaft just outside of my window, which was extremely noisy. Well, window... about 10 inches wide, if you call it window, then good luck...After just entering the room, I came back to the reception to ask them to give me another room. They refused because of &quot;all rooms reserved&quot;. I had option to look for another hotel, but all I was dreaming after all day of travelling, was just sleep, so I just took it as it is.When I met my workmates next day in the morning (Sun 9am!!!) we had all the same feelings about the hotel. We had just one dream: GET OUT FROM THERE!Good things: complimentary internet - worked finelocation in the city - just 5-10 minutes walk to the Times Squareok (just ok) - receptionwhen you go right from the hotel, there are some small shops (Korean, I guess) with some drinks, cigarettes, food etc."
99,1865,Aug 25 2008 	Great place....But...	This property is in a great location in litle korea town..the rooms are on the small size but hey its for sleeping anyway. beds are comfortable and very clean but the one hich in this place is EXTREAMLY poor reception for cel phones or at the least if you have t-mobile fugetaboutit it sucks unless you get a room faceing the street. missed many appts. due to bad reception. but asked to move rooms second day and problem was fixed. other than that I think it is a great value overall.ohhh yea the bar upstairs is way way over priced
100,1865,"Aug 9 2008 	Affordable rate terrible service ideal location	If I could give this place zero stars I would. The only thing good about this place is the location. It's ideally placed close to Penn Station and 34th Street subway stops. It's in the middle of New York so it's easy to get to via the subway, cab or shuttle. The reason I'm giving this a terrible review is the fact that they screwed up our room not once, but four times when we arrived. That alone is unacceptable. The guy at the front desk didn't do anything to accommodate us, neither did the manager.Here's what happened. My friend and I arrived just after midnight Saturday morning. We were guaranteed a late check in so we figured we'd have no problem upon arrival. Haha that's funny. We arrive and they tell us there's a problem with our room so they upgraded us to a bigger room...what they didn't tell us that it had one bed (we clearly said we wanted two beds) and it was next to the bar. Um...first of all, my friend was sick, second of all, we actually wanted to sleep. So we go back downstairs and request another room. The guy up front says no problem. We get to this room and we unlock the door only to find LUGGAGE AND PEOPLE in it already. The TV was blaring and everything. Luckily, there weren't people in there doing things half naked or something that could've been embarrassing. So we go downstairs with our luggage again. The guy tries to fix the situation but this time he puts us in a smoking room that was so tiny, a rollaway couldn't fit in there! This time, we're pretty annoyed, tired, cranky and pissed off. So we go downstairs again in the slow as molasses elevator and explain to the guy we want a comp room because a) they screwed it up so many times b) we didn't technically stay for &quot;Friday&quot; and c) they never really fixed the situation because it was almost two o'clock in the morning by the time we got a decent room. All we got was the runaround from the moment we checked in. We have the guy call his manager because there wasn't one on duty, he tried to find us another room at one of their other Apple Core Hotels because that's what good management does. They usually offer to pay the fee for the night and put you up somewhere else. Not this place. We had the option of a) having them WALK US to another hotel at 2 effin' AM in NYC and taking a small fee off our bill b) finding us another room giving us our regular AAA discount plus $50. We settled for another room with a roll away with the plan b arrangement. They finally got us to our room, but it still wasn't worth the trouble. I'm definitely sending a letter to the CEO to at least get a comp room for that first night. It made the start of our trip lousy...At least we finally got the room we requested for the rest of our stay because they really would've heard from us again. And trust me, it takes a lot to piss us off. The continental breakfast is OK but nothing special and neither are the rooms. They're overpriced for the &quot;quality.&quot; Don't do it unless you're desperate. Go somewhere else and pay a little more."
101,1865,"Aug 7 2008	Return Visit	If I returned it shews that I was not unhappy first time round last year.As I commented last time it is not the typical La Qinta in its own grounds with very spacious rooms. But you cannot expect that at a reasonable price in Manhattan.My wife is very fastidious and we have no complaints about cleanliness. The linen is clean and the bathroom, though small, kept spotless. The rooms do tend to be decorated in rather dowdy wallpaper, which can become scuffed around the doors and peel slightly in the bathrooms. This can lead to an initial downbbeat impression.This time we were on the 4th floor witha view of the street; last year we overlooked the light shaft. It was more pleasant but we did not spend time looking out of it! To live in the hotel room is surely not why most able-bodied travellers visit Manhattan!The major gripe I had last year was the reception desk staff. This year a complete change. Personable staff who smiled and actually communicated with guests. The telephone seemed to have been re-routed elsewhere too, which meant they could concentrate on dealing with guests.The breakfast must be one of the best complimentary ones going, particularly now the waffle makers, for which guests refused to follow the instructions, have been discarded. The room is perhaps too small for the numbers in the hotel, but it too is kept clean, well stocked and pleasantly managed. We too were using Return Points and there was no feeling of being given second best. With so much still to see and do in New York I am sure we will be back."
102,1865,"Aug 6 2008 	Great location and breakfast	We just visited US and stayed for a few nights at the hotel. The room was quite small with two qeen beds with not much space to put your luggage, and a small bathroom. This was however very well compensated by the very good location: two blocks from Empire state buildning just in between Broadway/6th street and 5th street. The breakfast was the best during our 3 week holiday with cereals, bagels, toast, egg, fruit, several drinks, yoghurt, donuts etc. We highly recommend the hotel."
103,1865,"Aug 3 2008 	Solid Value Unassuming Great Location	OK, it's not fancy, the elevators are slow, the rooms are small, and the lobby feels like a hallway, but for $199. this was a great deal for Manhattan. The location is great -- Penn station (NJ Transit from EWR or Amtrak from DC, Philly, or Boston) is 1-1/2 blocks away. Several subways are close which get you to various spots in Manhattan fast. And it's maybe a 10 minute walk to Times Square and the Theaters. Also check out the outdoor bar on the 14th floor, which gets a lively, fun local after-work crowd from the &quot;fashion district&quot;. The free breakfast is fun too -- not so much for the food, which is barely adequate -- but for all the fun, mostly-foreign tourists. I like to play &quot;guess that language&quot;, and it's not that easy here. For those that don't need fancy to enjoy a hotel, this one will do nicely."
104,1865,"Jul 28 2008	Central and Safe Location	My best friend and I traveled to NYC for the first time and wanted a hotel in a central location in Manhattan, but also something affordable. We stayed at the La Quinta for 5 days/4 nights. This hotel is in the middle of Korea Town and was a great location. It was walking distance to Times Square and Rockefeller Center, around the corner from the Empire State Building, plus it was easily accessible via the metro. There was a continental breakfast every morning, and while the cereal was stale, the juice was watered down and the milk was spoiled one morning, the bagels and yogurt weren't bad so we found enough snacks to get our day started. There were many markets within a block or two so we could always grab something to eat. The room was small (the queen sized bed took up most of the room) but it worked out fine since we weren't hanging out in the hotel except to sleep. Bathroom was a little dingy, but clean. The staff were friendly and we felt safe. Plus there was a cute roof-top bar with a view of the Empire State Building."
105,1865,"Jul 27 2008 	great location!	Great location above all ! And good cost performance.* very close to some subway stations.* H-mart super market is next to the hotel.(It would be very, very convenient especially for Asians!)* very close to Empire state building. (and many souvenir shops, as well)The only thing that I want to say is...I wish I could have had a refrigerator in the room!"
106,1865,"Jul 21 2008 	Great room ""That is all you need""	La Quinta hotels is almost all I use at work and at play and it will stay that way.We used Return points to go to New York for 4 nights ( Wenesday - Sunday morning). I was not sure if the free rooms deal would get us the &quot;free room Deal&quot; What we got was a very nice place to go to after the long days out and about the the city that near sleeps.New York City--- What a town and The Manhattan La Quinta was a very nice Hotel.Pro: LocationCons: Internet weak on floor 12. Thanks"
107,1865,"Jul 20 2008 	New York's SLOWEST Elevators Otherwise Great Hotel	Booked this hotel using LaQuinta Returns points and very pleased overall Room cleanliness was top notch. As the previous reviewer noted, the bathroom sink encroaches on the toilet but it's a century old building and bathrooms are on the small side. Overall the room was very comfortable and the housekeeping excellent. Don't think you'll find a cleaner room anywhere. Breakfast was nice too and the location of the hotel is quite convenient. Major shortcoming, however, is with the elevators. They move SLOWLY, very very slowly. While two elevators should be more than adequate for a hotel of this size, these two elevators move at about one-third the speed of a normal elevator. Hence there are long waits, even at 1 o'clock in the morning! If you're looking for a fast-paced &quot;New York minute&quot; trip, the elevators here will certainly disappoint."
108,1865,"Jul 18 2008 	Not On-Par with Other La Quintas	Okay, I realize that NYC is expensive and many room are small but is that any excuse to have a room where you can't sit on the toilet without getting jabbed in the side by the sink? (I guess they replaced the sink with a bigger one. So now you can't even lift the toilet seat due to the sink.) And if the bathroom wasn't bad enough, there was the noise from the hall. It sounded like the ice machine was in my room! All in all, this hotel was at budget hotel no where near the quality of other La Quintas I have stayed in."
109,1865,"Jul 8 2008	A great find in NYC	I booked this hotel for free using LQ points, but was pleased to read the reviews before I stayed there. What a find! I'll be returning when in NYC on a budget.Location - near subway stops, Madison Square Garden and Macy's. Lots of inexpensive restaurant options nearby. The hotel in in the midst of Korean restaurants, but I enjoyed walking by and looking in the windows - and buying an ice cream at one market.Room - a very nice moderate-range hotel room. Very clean and good maid service. Pluses - LOVED the free wifi - and the access to computers to printers in the Business Center. Those came in very handy for printing out show tickets and directions. Liked the roof-top bar.Great option for traveling on a moderate budget in NYC."
110,1865,"Jul 6 2008 	Good value; not great service	This hotel was at a great location: it was right by Macy's Herald Square and right in Little Korea. The subway was one block away. The service wasn't great at the hotel; they didn't care to even try to assist us in checking in early, but the room was large by NYC standards. The breakfast was good; saved us money from eating out. I can't say enough good things about the location, especially for the price. I would stay there again. We were hardly in the room anyway!"
111,1865,"Jun 23 2008 	Great deal!	I work in NYC and live in NJ so when I have to stay in the city late or when my boyfriend comes in from VT, I get a hotel room. This is by far the best place we've stayed in so far. I'm a girl that grew up on the Plaza and the Waldorf, but now that I'm footing the bill, its a different story. Yes, the rooms are small, but they are NOT Paris-small, if you want a big room, get a smaller bed. The place was immaculate. And for the price we paid, we could not have asked for anything more. Yes, the elevator is really really slow, but take the stairs! Its not like its a 40-story building. The staff was AMAZING and helpful.With any hotel, do some research first. Don't come on sites like this and complain because you didn't know that your hotel is in Korea Town when you could have found that out in under 20 seconds on the internet. And no, the whole hotel does not smell like Korean food..."
112,1865,"Jun 16 2008	More than satisfactory	My husband and I stayed at this hotel so that we could visit the Licensing Expo at the Convention Center. The hotel was a 20 minute walk from the convention center, so suited us perfectly.  We chose La Quinta because we are members of their Club, &quot;Returns&quot;. We were given a king size room, on the 6th floor. It was perfectly satisfactory for our needs - in fact, our room was on a corner and was quite large. The bed was great (as we often find at La Quinta properties); the bathroom was small but very clean; the location was excellent, and our room was very quiet even though we faced Korean Way. Double Glazing helps ! My only complaint is the price - two nights cost us more than $600, including taxes, which is outrageous. I tried priceline and hotwire but was unable to get any other hotel even close to that price though, so perhaps there were many other things happening in the Big Apple besides the (rather small) Licensing Expo."
113,1865,"Jun 2 2008 	horrible experience!!!	we booked this hotel because we use La Quinta for work. We had enough reward points for two nights and reserved a third night at the AAA rate. We checked in at 1:00 pm and went up to the room they gave us. The room was horrible. There was a terrible smell in the room. The bed was sinking, badly, in the middle. The carpet, drapes, and bed cover were all dirty. There was no way we would sleep there (nor should anyone else). We found alternate accommodations and went to the desk to check out. We were in the room only a few minutes. The hotel wanted to charge us for a night. Not just use our redeemed points, but to charge us on our credit card. We had cancelled the paid night in time. There was no basis for charging us. We had to get La Quinta on the phone to talk to the hotel before they agreed not to charge us. We were at the hotel dealing with this issue for nearly three hours of our vacation. On top of being dirty and unkept, the hotel was rude and tried to charge us when they should not have. Do not make a reservation here."
114,1865,"May 31 2008 	Rude and unacceptable receptionist	General:In the past I stayed at the La Quinta hotel at the Ontario airport in California. There I had the most wonderful stay. I told a friend about it and because of that he stayed at the La Quinta in Santa Rosa New Mexico and had a very pleasant stay as well. Those experiences moved the La Quinta chain clearly up on our lists of hotel-preferences. That's also why I booked the La Quinta again in Manhattan.Accessibility.The hotel is very close to a number of subway stations, which makes it very accessible.Room:I had a room with a queen-size bed. The room was about 5 x 5 meters, which I consider the minimum. I come from Europe where hotel-rooms are often smaller. If this is the minimum for me, then I expect it to be too small for most Americans. The bathroom was 3 x 1.5 meters, which I found too small. The room had one window only and it was situated in a corner of the room. This made the room dark and I find dark rooms unpleasant. I always had to have a lamp on.Gym:The gym had a number of cardio machines. I had hoped for weight-lifting material but those weren't there.Internet:There's wireless Internet in the hotel, but that only worked good enough in the lobby. In the room I would sometimes have normal Internet connection, then it would disappear (while I didn't change a thing), and after a while the connection would be back. That way you can't really work on the Internet. Going to the lobby and work on the Internet there should be an alternative, but there's often a draft because people are constantly going in and out of the lobby. The televisions with the news channels in the lobby disturb you while working on your notebook. If the televisions are off there's guitar music playing constantly, which can be a distraction. It's the same song playing over and over again, which makes the distraction worse. Therefore, going on the Internet in the lobby isn't an opton either.Surroundings:The nearest subway station was at the corner of the block, really close-by, which was very nice. There are lots of Korean good restaurants in the area. If you like shopping (LOL, which I don't :-) ), then Macy's is two blocks away, and Manhattan Mall is one block away.Reception:When I checked in the receptionist was unfriendly. Even though I had paid the total bill for my entire stay of 6 nights in cash at arrival, the receptionist still wouldn't accept an international driver's license as an ID, although it met all the requirements he mentioned. While at reception (!) he actually made me go through my luggage to find my passport, even though I had told him several times that I didn't know where I had put it. Although I travel a lot, this had never ever been an issue before (not even in the La Quintain in Los Angeles). He even had the guts to say that he wasn't obliged to let me into the hotel if I didn't show a passport. When I had half of my suitcase unpacked (in order to search for my passport), he complained about the contents of my suitcase being displayed in public, while it was him in the first place who had demanded me to do so. To be frank, I think that this man should find another job.Housekeeping:The personnell that cleaned my room were clearly different. They were nice and helpful. My compliments to them.Conclusion :Would I go there again? Don't hold your breath for it. The current experience moved the La Quinta OFF my list of hotel-preferences. Before submitting this review I sent it to the La Quinta main office in Irving, Texas in February this year to give them an opportunity to correct the situation, but there was no reply whatsoever.About me:I am a male in his fourties from Europe. I travel several times a year and often to the United States. In 2007 I stayed in least in 8 different hotels. Since the extra luxury of the upscale hotels isn't important to me I try to avoid them."
115,1865,"May 29 2008 	Do Not Recommend	My fianc and I stayed at the La Quinta Manhattan from the 12 - 19 May 08 and were disappointed. The water was shut off on the Saturday afternoon. A sign was posted in the lift saying that we would not have water between 1 and 3 pm We returned to the hotel at around half past 3 to discover that we had no water. We reported this to the front desk and they kept passing the buck saying it would be on in half hour. It was off till around half 10 at night. We couldnt shower, use the bathroom or make a cup of coffee in this time. The staff really didnt care. We were checking out on the Monday morning and asked to speak to the manager at around 9am. We were told he was in the hotel but they didnt know where he was. This went on until half 11 and we had been down 5 times!!!! In the end my fiance was told to go find the manager in his office in the basement?? For our inconvenience we stated that we were not happy paying for Saturday night but were happy to pay for the other nights we had stayed there. He knocked 30 dollars off the total bill which was more of an insult and gave the attitude that he couldnt be bothered to do anymore. We found it appalling that we had an issue we wanted to raise with the manager and we had to chase him instead of him coming to the front desk. He told us to take the matter up with the la Quinta chain which I have done but they have since ignored my emailThe hotel also has a friendly note in the room saying ask about our late checkout which we asked about and considering on average we had paid about $250 per night they were going to charge us $315 to use the room for an extra 4 hours. We didnt take them up on this. On getting our final bill which was minus $30 we noticed that we had been charged 3 different sets of fees and taxes per night. When asked what the Javits convention fee was the receptionist could only tell me that it was a government charge then she later mentioned it was a charge for our keys?? but on researching this cannot find anything to say that this is a compulsory charge. Therefore they added on $1.50 per night on top of the sales tax and occupancy tax. Overall the staff were not in the slightest bit helpful, the manager was rude and incompetent and his lack of management experience turned what would have been a good review into a bad review and we will not be staying at any of these hotels again."
116,1865,"May 29 2008 	Most likely would NOT stay here again.	My Start: This was my first time in NY (Manhattan) and I just spent a few days in Washington DC. Traveled using the Amtrak from DC to Manhattan, so it helped that Penn Station was about three blocks from the hotel. Rolling my 26 inch suitcase wasnt too bad.Pro: The hotel was close to many points of interest which was nice (Empire State Building, Penn Station, Subway , Macys, etc). I didnt have a great view from my window but you can see part of the Empire State Building.Con: Front desk staff was rude when I checked in. NOTE: Make sure you show your AAA card when checking in, if you booked using your membership. I forgot to and the front desk gave me a story about how foreigners book using AAA rates not knowing what it is, therefore the customer must show the card when checking in. I guess I was lucky in DC because they gave me the AAA rates without showing them my card (Doubletree Hotel Washington DC - nice hotel). It wasnt too much of a rate difference and the regular rate was charged for only one day since I realized it, so more or less it was the principle of the fact.Location (fyi): The hotel is located in Midtown Manhattan on 32nd Street which is also Korean Way (Koreatown). Lots of Korean foods, even Pinkberry, ATMs, some hotels like the Radisson Martinique and small shops. Its a busy street, night or day.My Room (Single queen size bed--non smoking): Much smaller then anticipated and bathroom was very cramped. The building is on the older side and my room did have a funny odor. But since I wasnt in the room much and I didnt have any bug or rodent problems, it was tolerable for me. This was the best that I could do for the location, budget and the time frame I was traveling.Most likely would NOT stay here again. This was just my experience with this particular hotel. Hope it helps."
117,1865,"May 28 2008 	Great place to stay!	Being a first time NY visitor, I wanted to be at a good central location, THIS was IT! Empire state building was less than a block from the front door! Subway station, 1-minute walk from hotel! Our room was small, but we had plenty of room. No one spends much time in their room in ny anyway. Our room was clean, smelled fresh, and had everything we needed. Housekeeping staff was especially helpful and polite. We will definitely stay here again. Just a quick note aboute new yorkers.... we think they get a bad rap. Everyone that we asked for directions or advice, bent over backwards to help us! A big thanks to them!"
118,1865,"May 28 2008 	Great Stay at La Quinta	We stayed at La Quinta for 5 nights in May. First time to New York and we throughly enjoyed it.The hotel is in a great location - very close to Macy's and Empire State building. What suprised me about Manhatten is altho its on a mega scale, its quite compact and getting around was easy. (Get a 3 day hop on-hop off ticket for a Grayline bus, its a great way to get round and see everywhere too)Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The room was fine, clean and equipt with everything we needed. you really only use your room to sleep in. The bathroom was quite small, which wasnt really a problem or fault but us two girls had a battle for the mirror to get ready in the evening!Was SO impressed with the breakfast in the morning. i'd read complimentary breakfast in NY hotels consists of coffee and a muffin (friends who were staying in a diff hotel around the corner confirmed this!) Breakfast room is open from 7am - 10am - is a bit like a help yourself cafe - with cereal, bagels and bread for toast, boiled eggs, fruit, doughnuts, juices and coffee. Perfect!There is also a roof top bar, business centre with computers/internet and they will hold your suitcases securely after you've checked out if you're flight is not till later in the day.i would definately recommend this hotel! a great stay!other points about new york - take comfy shoes, an umbrella (we got a bit wet some days!), go to the tkts booths in times sq or south seaport (i think thats what its called - its opposite staten island ferry port!) and get discount tickets for a broadway show, go to Lindy's for the best new york cheesecake and take an empty suitcase!"
119,1865,"May 22 2008 	La Quinta Manhattan-not as advertised! stayed April 2-5 2008	I made a reservation based in great part on the availability of wireless in the rooms. The wireless worked about 30 minutes of the three night stay. Despite their claim (on the in-room TV menu) that they will &quot;make things right or your night is free&quot;, they did not do so. When I checked out, I asked about an adjustment on my bill due to the lack of internet, and was told to email the manager. When I arrived home, I emailed, I also called and left a voicemail. No one EVER answered either message. For the record, I would have been satisfied with a token adjustment, but for them to not even have the courtesy to reply to my concerns was not cool.I would never recommend this hotel or any of the others in the Apple Core chain to anyone!"
120,1865,"May 16 2008 	A Cultural Experience!	I visited this hotel with my 2 daughters. We chose this location on a tip my daughter heard about Apple Core Hotels. We have stayed at many La Quinta's in the past and are familiar with the accomodations they offer. And we were pleased. We had been told that if you stay too near Time Square, it is very noisy, so this location is great. We had a room on the 7th floor with 2 beds, and although with 3 women getting ready in the mornings, it was a bit challenging. The bathroom is very short on counter space, we moved the mirror to the desk and made a hair and makeup station! The breakfast area is kept stocked and clean throughout the hours of 7-10am. Being located in little Korea was nice because it added to our cultural experience of visiting Chinatown and Little Italy too. But the location is great! We learned our way by subway, walked to to the Broadway show, central park,Times Square. It is near everything! When we come back we will definitely consider staying here again!"
121,1865,"May 4 2008 	Great clean rooms	Just returned from four nights in New York. The hotel's overall rating position does not do it justice and more recent reviews have reported positive experiences. Following advice from previous reviews I had requested a higher room and away from the lifts and these wishes were taken into account. Check in was very quick and the room (a double) whilst not large was certainly big enough for two adults with a few suitcases. We booked direct with the hotel and were able to take advantage of reciprocal membership of the AAA car association which provided us with an additional discount.The room was clean, everything worked and the bathroom was spotless. We were spoilt for television choices with over 40 channels to select from. As previous reviewers have commented the lifts are slow but that is only a minor flaw. The breakfast room was well patronised and a good breakfast had each day. The only down side to our room was its location near the ice machine which are on just some floors and why people would want ice in the early hours of the morning beats me, but it will wake you up if you are near it. Plenty of Korean places to eat out in near the hotel but beware US plate sizes are much larger than in Australia and you may not need to order as much as you would if back home. Overall a good experience."
122,1865,"Apr 22 2008	La Quinta was comfortable.	The LA Quinta Hotel was just what we needed. It was a great location, we walked to the hotel from Penn Station. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The lobby, while small, was adequate. The room was very clean and this is important to us. The room was small but it was all we needed. The continental breakfast was very good. There were many choices and there was an attendant taking care of everything and keeping it tidy.We would recommend this hotel and if we return to New York we would stay at La Quinta."
123,1865,"Apr 17 2008 	I'd go back	This hotel is a very good deal for NYC. Our room was large and clean and quiet. The room was not on the street so it had a &quot;view&quot; of the empire state building. (Not really much of a view because it is so tall and so close.) The included breakfast was very convenient, healthy and ample. There were bagels, cold cereal, yogurt, donuts, fruit, and juices. One down side was the coffee. Neither the brewed coffee nor the instant expresso were very good. But given the cost of eating out in NYC, the breakfast was worth a lot. We found the staff behind the desk to be very helpful. They always were willing and able to give us detailed directions. We came into the city on Amtrak so the location (two blocks to Penn Station) was very good. There is a subway station one block away. The location is in Korea town so there are lots of good restaurants near by. There were three computers with internet access in the business center. I never had to wait for one. The gym had an assortment of treadmills/stair-steppers and a bow-flex universal gym."
124,1865,"Apr 7 2008 	Great stay in NY	We've had good luck with La Quintas elsewhere in the US, so my family decided to try Manhattan location. We were pleasantly surprised with our stay. First, and most importantly, the room was very large (by NY standards) with additional space not near the beds. There were five of us, so that was very welcome. The room was clean and everything worked well, save for the inconsistent shower temps. We were on the 12th floor, where it was quiet and we had an awesome view of the Empire State Building. The Breakfast was great, as was the location. The price wasn't cheap, but fair given the location. We would stay there again- get a courtyard view!"
125,1865,"Apr 5 2008 	look for something else!	Small, dirty rooms. Much to expensive! After a room change I'm sitting here right in front of the rattling ice machine and the smell of a fast food restaurant at the other side. It's better to stay at home!"
126,1865,"Apr 2 2008 	Easter in Manhattan	I booked this hotel specifically for the location and because I loved the idea of having a rooftop bar. We arranged our stay to coincide with friends and thought this would be an ideal place to have an early drink before stepping out.We were not disappointed the view was fantastic and the barman (I think he was called Julian) was a real character. We ended up spending a great deal of time socialising there.We arrived late and were checked into a room that was very small. We asked at the desk to be changed and although there were no rooms available that night (it was a very busy holiday period) we were given a much bigger room the next day. We found the people on reception were very friendly.The hotel breakfast room was always busy (again it was the holiday season) but as we were in New York we wanted to go out to experience the Deli breakfast culture, so this was not a problem.The hotel location was fantastic, it was in walking distance to all of the main attractions and only a short walk to the subway.With reference to some of the other hotel guests reviews I would agree that the hotel is in need of a little TLC but from my point of view overall it was a pleasant experience.Good find, I'll be back."
127,1865,"Apr 1 2008	Clean 	My family and I had never visited the Big Apple before this trip. We were skeptical because we heard the rooms at many New York hotels were tiny and dirty, and that the staffs were often rude and unresponsive. We were very pleasantly surprised by the La Quinta in Manhattan. Our room was at least the same size as other hotels in less crowded cities. It was clean and there were 2 queen size beds (which were a must, but almost impossible to find in the city!). Our room was missing the shower curtain upon arrival. I called the desk and they said someone would be up to correct this. I waited about 20 min. and called again. The clerk was apologetic and said someone would be there immediately. And guess what...they were! The breakfast was great every morning. It was so helpful that we didn't have to spend time finding a restaurant for breakfast and waiting for service. There were bagels, cereal, coffee, tea, fruit, donuts, yogurt, etc. which offered something for everyone in our family.Don't get me wrong - if you're looking for and can afford the Waldorf-Astoria- you may not want to stay here. We also didn't pay $400 - $500 per night either. If you want a reasonable price for a clean, well-maintained, pleasantly run hotel, this is the place for you. We were there to sightsee and wanted a clean, safe place to stay. We got more than we expected. Everyone from housekeeping to concierge to the person keeping the breakfast items stocked to the manager was friendly and helpful. Even if my husband and I go back w/o children, we would definitely stay here again!"
128,1865,"Mar 26 2008 	Issues with La Quinta Manhattan	I recently stayed at the W. 32nd St La Quinta in NYC, and the Room Number Sign was missing the entire time on the outside in the hallway.......the shower had no thermal control...that is, it varied from scalding to freezing cold often during the course of 1 shower (this is a HAZARDOUS situation in my view for children or the elderly!). It occured every time I showered (early morning, as well as late afternoon). Please get this serviced before someone gets seriously burned! Also....the elevators aren't timed correctly.....when I pushed the down button on the 3rd floor....and BOTH elevators were idle on the first floor.......they BOTH continued past me and traveled up to the top floor, only stopping on the way down.....full of upper level guests......a problem trying to check out with luggage!"
129,1865,"Mar 24 2008 	Great Value!	For anybody thinking of travelling to NYC for a break, this is the place to stay. The location of the hotel means that you can be into Manhattan in around 20 mins or should you need to travel away from town (as we did to visit family) it is equally easy.I travelled with my wife and 2 kids (18 &amp; 20) and we felt safe at all times in the district. For $25 you can buy a weekly pass for the subway and we found this excellent value for money. Around 500 yards down the road from the hotel is a diner called Pete's which I cannot recomend highly enough for breakfast, lunch or dinner.Back to the hotel.The only small gripe I had was that it was a little noisey with guests not respecting others and making excessive noise when coming back in at 12 / 1am. I made a complaint to the front desk which they took very graciously and put a stop to the noise!All in all if you add the $25 travel card to a week's stay it comes nowhere near what is being charged to stay in Manhattan. No need to pay those prices when you can stay at La Quinta!"
130,1865,"Mar 21 2008 	Good value and location	My husband and I stayed at The Manhatttan Laquinta in November 2007 and I would recommend this location. We found the rooms clean and the staff helpful. The continental breakfast and daily newspapers were a nice bonus. The location is very close to Macy's, subway connections, and MSG.We were pleasantly surprised to be in the heart of little Korea and had great restaurants all along the street many being open 24 hours. We felt safe at this location and I would stay there again. I would like to thank the manager Sunnie for her help in making our stay in New York City great. I look forward to coming back.Yours truly ST."
131,1865,"Mar 18 2008 	Ok for the price	The room was ok for the price. The room was a bit small and the hallways needed a good paint job. My boyfriend went down to the continental breakfast 10 minutes before they were to close up, but they already had. Outside our window people were screaming at eachother at 6 am and when you are out till 2:30 in the morning thats not something you want to deal with. Even though I know that is out of the hotels hands. Overall for the price, it is a bed and a shower and that is all you really need when you are in New York City."
132,1865,"Mar 3 2008	La Quinta Perfect Place to Stay.	Stayed at the Manhattan La Quinta for five nights and I have to say both my husband and I thought is was a perfect place to stay. Just two blocks from Penn Station so you really had the city at your feet. We paid just 130usdollers per night. Breakfast is included in the price, and we stuffed ourselves silly, then at least you could get out and see loads before hunger pangs stopped us. The staff always had a good morning. The rooftop bar is a must see. Great place to go at night to wind down and the suprise is the view of the Empire State Building through the glass. It is fantastic to see the building all lit up while sipping your drink. Rooms were always tidy great cleaning service. Overall have to give this hotel a thumbs up for everything. Had a great time there. Regina."
133,1865,"Feb 27 2008 	Could be better	I guess from New York standards and prices it was okay. The Continental Breakfast was not too bad, but the front desk staff was not too helpful at times. Good location, but I wouldn't stay there again if I could help it."
134,1865,"Feb 22 2008 	Not What We Expected	We booked a non-smoking room for 4 adults 2 months prior to our arrival. We were only staying one night for a concert at the Garden. Cost-$480.00. When we arrived they tried to put us in a smoking room because that was all that was available. They said my reservation was only a preference, not a guarantee. We refused smoking even though they said they would 'spray it real good' . We ended up in a room with a double bed and 2 roll aways. We were wall-to-wall beds.Bathroom had a sink but no vanity... made hair &amp; makeup rituals an adventure...the electrical outlet was on the other side of the toilet. No lid on the toilet and the tank cover sloped. Don't bring a curling iron....too dangerous.Hotel is old but convenient. Staff was pleasant but I would never stay there again."
135,1865,"Feb 20 2008 	Loved La Quinn	After a less than par night down the street at the Radisson Martinique, we decided to switch hotels. I was very pleased with the friendly customer service we received at the front desk. The room was clean and larger than others (by New York Standards) and there is a private bathroom. The room is a bit old looking, but still very nice and comfortable. For the same price as other hotels La Quinta includes a complimentary breakfast, which I thought was amazing! There is fruit, donuts, bagels, toast, juices, coffee, milk, yoghurt and even red bulls. It was quite a good selection, and we were able to leave everymorning with a full tummy and head out and explore the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The location is great, just around the corner from the empire state building, near some asian restaurants and near a nice frozen yoghurt place. The street that the hotel is located on is an asian street? (I'm not sure how to say it, but there are many asian stores and restaurants). At the other end of the street there is a subway station. It's also about 5 blocks to the big Macy's. I would stay here again. The cost was something like $220-250 per night, but it's worth the extra dollars."
136,1865,"Feb 18 2008 	Great stay	This was our first stay in New York and after seeing pictures of various hotels I was afraid to get a tiny room. But for a great price we got a good sized room. The breakfast was good, there was a perfect staff member who filled everything up before it was gone. People at front desk and shop were also very helpful. Location was very good. The room was a bit warm and if you turn heating off it's quite cold during winter, but it was comfortable enough. We had a great stay! Evelien, The Netherlands"
137,1865,"Feb 13 2008	Lacking in customer service	The hotel manager was not available for us to speak with the entire weekend. It appeared that there was no one &quot;in charge&quot; and could not make any corporate decisions. The restroom on the lower level was dirty, unkept and had graffiti on the hand blower. The &quot;breakfast area&quot; was very cold and everyone was wearing their coats. One of the concierge had to look in her books and map to give us &quot;inaccurate directions&quot;. I complained to one of the hotel clerks to no avail and was told that the manager would be in on Monday. When we left in the morning she was no where to be found. Our room wastebaskets went umemptied, the windows were dirty and the bathtub was filthy. The room was in need of updates and a good cleaning. The location was very close to the subway and there were many restaurants within walking distance. I would not recommend anyone stay here unless they expect less than average customer service."
138,1865,"Feb 11 2008 	Fabulous: center of midtown shopping near Empire State bldg!	This was a perfect hotel for 2 young ladies from the tri state area staying overnight in NYC. Location was absolutely perfect on a busy side street, around the corner from Macy's 34th st, 5th Ave &amp; midtown shopping and Penn Staion. My main reason for booking this hotel for my daughter and her friend was for the location, near Penn Station as they had to get a train back the following day and it was within walking distance. The AAA rate was the best rate I could find for a AAA 3 diamond rated hotel ($159), and I felt comfortable booking this hotel given the positive reviews I read as well as the prompt response posted by the hotel management to negative comments. I have worked in midtown NYC for over 25 years and am very familiar with the area, not the particular street the hotel was on, and especially at nights and wasn't sure what to expect at nights. I was shocked by the number of peeople on the street the hotel was on and somewhat concerned when I pulled up on Saturday night, but then later learned that this street is popular with the Korean community which adds to the NYC excitement! Breakfast was great - plentiful with lots of choices. Take it from a local, great central spot at an unbelievable low rate!"
139,1865,"Feb 10 2008 	Great price/location	This hotel was perfect for us. We just wanted a clean place to stay while we enjoyed the city, and this hotel more than met our needs. The rooms are plain, but decently-sized for a room in the city. The lobby and breakfast area were very nice, but were very crowded at all times. The upstairs bar was very impressive, as was the view of the Empire State Building."
140,1865,"Jan 26 2008 	Comfortable stay	Our third trip to NY and our first stay at La Quinta. One of the main reasons we decided to book here was the location - a central location near to Penn Station (this was also to our advantage as we flew into Newark and decided to transfer by train) - as you leave the station on 7th it's just a two block walk to the hotel.The hotel is in the Korean district and is surrounded by restaurants and watering holes - the ESB is directly behind the hotel and Macy's is a two minute walk away. There is also a subway 100 yards away - a perfect location.The reception area is small and has a few loungers next to the lift and the small shop - it makes it feel like a friendly place to stay, and indeed the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They also have safety deposit boxes in reception which we took full advantage of.The room itself was basic - a double bed, tv, coffee machine, hair dryer etc. The bathroom appeared to have been updated recently and all in all was a comfortable place to sleep - which after all is all you need in a hotel in NYC, the only time we spent there was when we were sleeping!The 14th floor houses the bar which was small but cosy. An excellent idea as you look out at the ESB as you're supping away! The bar is like a conservatory so you have excellent views, particularly at night.Breakfast was also included. An impressive assortment of cereal, bagels, doughnuts, fruit and youghurts. A member of staff was always available to replenish the food so that it was always available. This was great as you could fill up before walking it all off!There is also a fitness suite there, but I didn't use it so can't comment. In the basement area there is also an internet room.A very nice hotel that I will consider again when I return to NYC."
141,1865,"Jan 25 2008 	Be Warned	We had booked into this hotel for two rooms for four people, one a brother and sister. On check in there was only two rooms with double beds. No other room was available and our son slept on the floor. On asking if there was a trundle available the answer was no and if there was a spare mattress were told it was being used. They did however kindly send up a spare bedspread, but not pillow. It was the middle of winter in New York City. No apologies and no discount. The rooms were dark, musty smelling and depressing."
142,1865,"Jan 18 2008 	Second stay at this hotel	Just got back from our visit to New York,stayed at La Quinta W32 street.Stayed here 2 years ago and decided it is an excellent location and very reasonable breakfast included.It cost us $580 including taxes for 4 nights in a room with two queen beds !Only one tiny problem check in was a bit slow due to the fact the computer system was down.Staff were very courteous room was cleaned daily and towels plentiful.Suggest if travelling from Newark come by rail,$15 single trip comes into Penn Station and two block walk to hotel.We also took trips on the Metro at $2 per trip, one to Coney Island which took about 40 mins.Bubba Gumps on Times Square is a great place to eat,also try the food hall in Grand Central station.Brilliant holiday cant wait to go again."
143,1865,"Jan 16 2008	A Nice Experience	I just came back from a 13 day vacation with my daughter in New York. La Quinta Hotel in Manhattan was a very good choice. Its central location made shopping and all the attractions of New York manageable. There's a subway station at the corner of the street and Times Square and the Theatre locations are all within walking distance. The hotel was clean and the staff cooperative. It offered complimentary breakfast and free internet facilities in the room. This was really brilliant. It saved us the trouble of rushing out at the crack of dawn to have a bite and kept us in contact with our email services at no extra cost. The rooms also had a coffee maker machine and complimentary coffee.The only draw back was that the hot water faucet got really hot in the tub, so if this happens to you be careful not to scald your hands. The airconditioner broke down (in January remember), but the front desk sent me an extra blanket and a portable heater till they got it fixed.All in all I would recommend the hotel if you want to be in central Manhattan and don't mind a room with no view, in favour of a reasonable budget.Zeinab M.Cairo, Egypt"
144,1865,"Jan 8 2008	a great find in NY	Just returned from a 4 night stay at La Quinta and have to say what a great find it was ! We paid just $135 per night from the hotel website and with the exchange rate so good, I'd challenge anyone to find better for 70 a night inc breakfast.The location was great, across the road from Macys (girlfriend happy) and within walking distance of 42nd st and Times Sq area with Subway at end of street as well. Free internet usage for guests is a plus, the roof top bar is a fantastic location for a post-shop drink to recover - can't be a better view of empire state anywhere. Also, free safe deposit box at reception.Few minor gripes - the lifts must be the SLOWEST anywhere.Our room wasn't cleaned and made up the 1st day and despite repeated requests, we never got any condiments to go with the in room coffee maker. The hot/cold water situation was the main problem - either scalding or freezing, plus the day we left there was no hot water or heating at all because of maintainance.But overall, great location &amp; price. Will certainly return."
145,1865,"Jan 7 2008	Horribe Hotel and Extremely Rude Staff!!!!	I recently statyed at the La Quinta Manhatten property for two nights. This was my first time to stay at a La Quinta in the state of New York. I used my points for the stay. My wife and I were extremely disappointed with the service at the hotel. Upon checking in we were greeted very rudely by Ronica at the front desk. When asking her questions, she would not answer them and made no effort to find out the answer or point me in the right direction. At any hotel, you should have someone at the front desk that can interact well with people. Ronica had no social skills and was extremely rude to my wife and I.We later went down to the concierge desk and asked for directions. The lady there was on the phone with a friend when I asked my questions and she continued to talk in a foreign language to her friend while trying to explain the directions to me. I finally gave up and left and she continued her conversation.I discussed these concerns with the hotel manager and was told that the hotel is operated by union employees. I'm not sure what difference this makes or why this was even mentioned. She did not apologize for my experience and just said she would look into it.Overall, we were very disappointed with the stay and I would never recommend this hotel to anyone in the future. We will definitely not be staying at this hotel in the future."
146,1865,"Jan 3 2008 	Great value and location	We have stayed two times at the La Quinta since our daughter lives nearby. The location is ideal and the price is right. Both of our rooms were quite small, but clean and adequate. The bathrooms were clean but dated. We had no view, but the value made it worthwhile. Elevators are slow; breakfast was more than adequate, although the breakfast room was small. Check in went smoothly. Discounted parking down the block. All in all, we will return."
147,1865,"Jan 2 2008	Happy Customer	I booked this hotel for my fiance's mother between Christmas and New Years. After reading some very negative reviews on this site I started second guessing my choice, but in the end it turned out well. The room was exactly what it should have been for the rating and price. It was clean, comfortable and affordable. An unexpected perk was the generous breakfast. At check-in she did overhear some guests complaining about hot water issues at the front desk, but the staff seemed to be addressing them. We later figured out that shower is labeled backwards, so the hot comes out when it is set on cold. Don't be mislead - all NYC hotel rooms are generally small. If you want luxury you have to pay top dollar. I'm sure La Quinta's in other places where real estate isn't so precious are a lot more spacious. As someone who has lived in NYC - the Herald Sq location is excellent for shopping and exploring the city, with the subway just half a block from the hotel entrance. 32nd Street where the hotel is located is known as Koreatown by New Yorkers, but it's hardly the only thing the area has to offer. Macy's, Madison Sq Garden, Penn Station and the Empire State are all very very short walks. My future mother-in-law was very pleased and plans to go back. This hotel is good value for the price."
148,1865,"Dec 31 2007	La Quinta New Years in NY	Very good location to everything. We were in walking distance to Times Square and Rockafeller Center. Even though check-in was at 3 they let us check in real early which was awesome because our destination was Times Square and you have to get there early especially for New Years. Very good location to the trains. The hotel is a little older but fit our needs, especially internet access. I would highly recomend it!"
149,1865,"Dec 26 2007 	Great location and Price	What a location!!!! If you are debating the Waldorf or this hotel then it's not a fair comparison....the Waldorf bathrooms are gross :). However, if you want a hotel with a decent price, good location and CLEAN. Then this hotel is it! I read reviews and changed hotel reservations 4 times before finally deciding on this location and I'm glad I did. Location: Walking distance to everything! Empire State Bldg two blocks, pick up for the sightseeing double decker busses are around the corner, food and shops all around you, Time Square walking distance, Broadway walking distance, Penn Station walking distance. And by walking distance I mean my 60 year old mother could easily make the trip.It really is a great location. Felt completely safe no matter what time of day or night. (We are from a small town so this is a major change for us....but we felt completely safe in traveling...just 2 women)Hotel: The lobby is nice and the rooms were clean. We had no problem with anything. Rooms are small...but I think all NY rooms are. Are you really going to NY to stay in your room all day? B'fast is called continental for a reason. If you're expecting bacon and eggs then you misunderstood what the description meant. Plenty of food to feed us until lunch. Cereal, oatmeal, fruit, pastries, breads, bagels, juice, coffee and Red Bull. Recommendations: We got a SuperShuttle from airport to hotel and back for $32 roundtrip/per person, highly recommended. We bought the all loops tour on Gray Line Double Decker, hop on and off bus tour for $44 online. Also recommend, they have good guides and it can also be your transportation to different parts of the city. Feel free to email me with questions. I believe this website is a great tool for travelers. I know I use it ALL the time!"
150,1865,"Dec 25 2007 	A Real Find in Great Location	The La Quinta Hotel Manhattan is an oasis in the middle of the city. Located on 32nd Street, just off Broadway, the location can't be beat. You are near so much or the subway stop is just down the street. The hotel is very well kept. Free computer useage in the Business Center is a real plus. The &quot; Big Boys &quot; charge as much as $ 20+ per day. The free breakfast in the morning is very tasty and filling. Someone is always present to keep the items fresh and well stocked.The La Quinta is a jewel !!!"
151,1865,"Dec 9 2007	Average hotel	Myself and 3 other girlfriends stayed at the La Quinta, it was very busy the day we arrived, the staff were helpful, the rooms clean, the breakfast nice (just the basic toast, fruit, cereal etc but very plentiful), the hotel could not have been more central and parking was straight across the road from the hotel what more could you want!!!"
152,1865,"Nov 15 2007 	A 180 from the reviews on TA	After reading multiple reviews regarding rats and rude staff, I was prepared for the worst. Fortunately the stay was nothing but the opposite. The location was easy to get to and perfectly located near the subway, Empire State Building and Macy's. Check-in was friendly and easy. The rooms were dated and only slightly noisy from outside honking. Linens were clean. The bathroom was small but adequate. The breakfast was the best part of the stay - nuts, dried fruit, bagels, doughnuts, muffins, fresh fruit, Red Bull, yogurt, etc. It was over the top and very satisfying. The hotel lobby and stoop were consistenly full like a hostel - lots of folks about. My friend used her LQ points for the stay; not sure that I would pay to stay here but it was not at all like the reviews I had read. The property is only 4-5 doors down from Pinkberry - a great frozen yogurt shop. Highly recommended!"
153,1865,"Nov 12 2007 	Adequate Accomodations (Just Barely)	The best thing about the hotel is the location. I originally asked for a room with two beds, but was given a room with only one. The bathroom door looked like it had a hole in it and they repaired by plastering the hole in a sloppy manner. The bathroom fan would go off when one turned on the light and sounded like a plane was taking off! The comforter looked like it had not been washed in a while and had some stains on it, but the actual bedding (pillows, sheets) was clean. Breakfast was good and free with the room. I stayed here for a business trip, but if I was paying for the trip, I would not stay here as it is not worth the cost. The Radisson down the street looked much nicer and was closer to Broadway. Lastly, they have the slowest elevators that I have ever seen in a hotel."
154,1865,"Nov 6 2007 	oh no....	This is going to be a three part review. I'm starting this review as I sit at work, because I wasn't able to check into the hotel as of yet. The rooms were not ready when I arrived at 1:30 PM. No rooms. Zero. Of course, it didn't matter to the front desk at all that I was here for business and I just wanted to secure my room for the night.On top of it all, I had the front desk person tell me that the rooms weren't ready because the maids were on break until 1 PM. Um... it's 1:35 now... where are they, if they aren't back and doing their job? They looked up to see that I was right, but the answer was standard -- come back later. This, after calling the day before, because I had read the reviews on how bad the customer service was and the cleanliness of the rooms. I wanted to find out of this was true or not -- the answer I got when I made that first phone call? &quot;If you are trying to cancel, it's too late, the 24 hour policy is in effect, and we will have to charge you for the room.&quot;But... I just wanted to talk to someone about the Tripadvisor reviews.I left them with a comment that they should look on this website and see what's being said. This type of customer service CLEARLY does not make me ever want to come back."
155,1865,"Nov 4 2007	What a nightmare!!	We arrived at this hotel at about 1am on a Friday morning. I called in advance to make sure my reservation was all set. I was transferred numerous times and when the gentleman finally helped me, he was quite rude.When we arrived at the hotel, we were in line behind three people who were inquiring about renting a room. The front desk man gave them a rate of $200 per night. Howevery, when I rent up to check into my room, which I booked with my travel agent, the hotel refused to honor the price my travel agent had booked at. I had booked the room at a rate of $247, but the man at the front desk stated &quot;it's a very busy weekend, we can't charge that.&quot; I found it funny that the couple in front of me were only charged $200. My rate was going to be $404. Because I had no where else to go at 1am in NYC, we checked in. The hallways were filthy. The mirror in front of the elevator had spit on it. And, I mean spit. Our room, was less than clean. The shower had hair in it. The room was very run down. Wallpaper was pealing off the walls. The carpet was so dirty, we didn't walk on it with our bare feet. The curtains were broken and wouldn't shut. We slept about 20 minutes and checked out. Got a better rate at the Radisson Lexington and had a fantastic stay there. I would never stay at this or any La Quinta hotel again."
156,1865,"Nov 4 2007 	our stay at la quinta was fine	As visitors to New York from Ireland we had no problems with our stay in La Quinta Manhattanwe got a double room for 2 nights with 2 reservations.one night for $265 the other for $160 .The room was very clean if a little dated,the bathroom was spotless.The breakfast which was included in the price was great,plenty of everything ie cereals,bagels,donuts,yogurts,fruit, even free red bull drinks.The hotel is very central on a very lively street with alot of Korean restaurants, when you leave the hotel turn left for the empire state building a few minutes walk or turn right on leaving hotel for maceys nearby.I would concur with other reviewers that the people on the desk were not very friendly,but i had no real problem with this.In summary i would recommend this hotel for its location and its breakfast."
157,1865,"Nov 4 2007 	did not love this place!!!	If you don't like Korean food, too bad. This hotel has no other kind of restaurant within blocks. And if you don't like TV blaring at you from every public space except the computer room, don't stay here. Especially if you like a quiet breakfast. If you are concerned with cleanliness, don't stay here. And if you hate eating off of styrofoam and drinking from styrofoam cups, don't stay here. If you don't wan't the help throwing you out of the breakfast nook at precisely ten am.,with a loud announcement from the middle of that very small space, don't stay here. If you don't want to run the risk of finding a rat in your room, don't stay here. ( I did not personally see a rat, but as I was checking out, a man came to the desk, quite clearly upset and saying there was a rat in the bathtub.) I would never stay here again. Beds were good, noise on the floors was quiet, , but the exhaust fan in the bathroom was so encrusted with dirt as to be useless. The room wasn't filthy, by any means, but neither was it spotless, especially the bathroom. I could go on, but you get the picture."
158,1865,"Oct 31 2007	Compassionate Staff	My mother made NY and Boston reservations for a trip to the NE to see the leaves change. She became very ill and has been in ICU for 6 weeks now.I have been taking care of her business and realized that when her bill came, that she had reservations in NYC and in Boston. I called both hotels and explained the situation. I really appreciate how LaQuinta Manhattan refunded my mother's money to her card when they clearly did not have to do that. This will be the first place I stay next time I come to NY to visit my daughter.Thank you staff for a job well done and for caring about others above making money."
159,1865,"Oct 20 2007 	Worst hotel ever	This is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at. I stayed here six years ago, the last time I was in New York. At that time, it belongedto the best western group and was very nice, so I had no hesitation in booking again for this trip. However on arrival I was extremely shocked and disappointed. Our double room was a quarter the size it had been the last time. O.k hotel rooms are small in manhattan, but Inearly fell over the bed when I opened the door. Two bags and the room was full, there was no space to walk. This however, was not the worst. The room was filthy. The bed clothes were stained, there was a pubic hair on the tiles in the shower, there was dust and dirt everywhere. The room was exceptionally hot and the windows were nailed closed. The air conditioning was on but blew out a hot breeze while sounding like a train. Having been travelling for 20 hours and needing some sleep, we went to reception to request a larger room. We were informed that none were available and that we could be moved the next day. A business man who had been checking in at the same time as us, was checking straight out again. It was late so I put on my insect repellent, laid my coat out on the bed and tried to get some sleep. It was very difficult to sleep with the extreme heat and loud noise of the supposed air conditioning, which by the way cannot be turned off. Next morning, exhausted and wheezing from the dust, we went out to find an internet cafe and another hotel. The computers in la quinta were broken!. We booked into the sofitiel (a lovely hotel) and returned to la quinta about 1pm to collect our luggage and check out.When we arrived at our room, the door was wide open and our luggage was gone. Down at reception, after some investigation, it was discovered that the staff had moved our luggage to an upgraded room as we had enquired about it the previous day (at our expense). When we said we wished to check out they gave us a key to the room to get our bags and charged thirty dollars for late check out. I later emailed the apple core group to inform them. I recieved an e mail from the general manager, apologising and stating that this was unusual, however judging by the amount of similar experiences reported on this site, I don't think it's at all unusual. They offered me a 10% discount on a future stay but frankly, if they offered it to me for free, I would not stay at la quinta again and would strongly advise anyone thinking of booking this hotel to think again!"
160,1865,"Oct 18 2007	Don't waste your money	This hotel is a dog. Front Staff treats you like a number. The pictures on their web-site are deceiving. It all smoke and mirrors to look really nice and it isn't. Room decor is old and beds are firm, wall paper is bubbling. No internet access and the response time to fix it doesn't exsist. Stay down the street at the Radison. I was going to stay two night, but my wife was crying because everything was so depressing. I should have bailed even before I checked in, but I was afraid that I would be charged anyway. Avoid this dump."
161,1865,"Oct 8 2007	Good value!	&quot;La Quinta is Spanish for 'everything just clicks'&quot; is one of the hotel's payoffs, and for the two weeks I stayed there that seemed to be quite the case. The room and bathroom was clean, he bed was fine, the tv and air conditioning worked, the staff was pleasant, and the breakfast okay. All in all nothing spectacular, just a good place to stay if you're in NYC to make the most of the city and not hang around the hotel all the time. It's within walking distance of most things and it's really easy to get there with the subway, which is the biggest con I can think of. The hotel is right next to The Empire State Buliding and has a roof bar with quite a spectacular view of the Great Neighbour. I will definately recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a cheap place to stay without compromising their level of comfort."
162,1865,"Sep 27 2007 	Bad hotel	At the beginning, we booked a room for 2 with a queen size bed.Than, as a friend decided to stay with us, we changed the reservation for have a room for 3.And when we arrived, we were given a iny double bedroom, with oinly a queen size bed.No possible negociation with the reception, who didn't want to listen to us.Finally, one of us had to sleep on the floor, as they could not even provide us an additional mattress. They did not provide us some more sheets or towels.But of course, we had to pay the charge for 3!"
163,1865,"Sep 18 2007	Good prices for big city	This hotel was great. I haved stayed in the city a bunch of times and it is always at least 250-300 a night for a basic room. Everyone knows rooms are not very big in the city. If you give them your AAA card or AARP you 10% off. This helps if you are on a budget. The free breakfast lasts until noon so its practical, not like most of the continental breakfasts hotels have that end at 10 at the least. I am 23 so i like to go out at night and nothing is better than just going downstairs to have a free breakfast. By the way its really only bagels toast doughnuts coffee and OJ the basics. The computers are free downstairs so if you have to print out you boarding passes you can do that too. They will hold your bags for free downstairs if you arrive too early for check in or leave later than checkout time which is noon. Another savior for younger people. It is also real close to Times Square and most other major attractions. All in all this was a great hotel and i would stay there again."
164,1865,"Sep 17 2007 	Worst hotel I have stayed at	The hotel was dirty. Mold in two rooms, hair in the shower, dirty comforters, a/c did not work. I'm a member of the La Quita member program and booked thru the reservation service."
165,1865,"Sep 9 2007 	Student-class hotel	This is a student class hotel. Cons: Nothing fancy about the room (had king size room). The bathroom was below average, but could be used. No safe in the room + the TV had some problems. No refrigirator (ice machine).Late checkout is for extra charge.Pros: Excellent location. Walking distance from all major attractions. Free WiFi + free computers on the -1 floor. Good buffet breakfast, but small dining room.Final note: Good choice for budget travellers. If you need business style comfort - it's not for you."
166,1865,"Aug 24 2007	No New York welcome	I booked my parents into this hotel and given the price, I was hugely disappointed. I think we paid about $250 dollars for a double room (small, air conditioning was just noise, dingy and not altogether clean shower - not entirely sure why the prices were so high for a two-star hotel. When we arrived, the receptionist barely looked us in the eye before telling us our room wouldn't be ready for another 4 hours. Did she offer up the possibiltiy to leave our luggage somewhere? No. She made absolutely no attempt to 'smoothe things over' given we'd been on a 8 hour flight and were completely exhausted. The 'bell boy' was a bit of a joke too, he looked at me when I said I wanted to check my luggage in, then asked me to bring it on over (i'm a 5ft nothing female and I was surrounded by 3 suitcases and two bags) I don't know about you, but that is not service. A hostel may have been friendlier... Suffice to say, we got none of the all-American welcome that one expects so people do not stay here if that's what you're after too."
167,1865,Aug 21 2007 	Great Value and Location	Great bargain for mid-town Manhattan. Friendly and accomodating staff. Room size above average and clean. Air conditioner was sufficient even with entire week of above 90 temperature.Great location within walking distance of all subway lines and Penn station.Complementary breakfast in clean dining room with many healthy choices for great start to full day of sightseeing or business. Gets crowded quickly on weekends - come early!!
168,1865,"Aug 18 2007 	Very bad	Its simply not worth it. The only good thing it has is the location.First night, room at second floor. Room was extremelly small and there was a bad noice coming from the aircondition. After calling the front desk they sent up a guy to check it. But that guy couldnt speak a single English word. And of course he couldnt fix it. Noice stopped after 30 minutes and started again in the morning, when they decided to give me another room in a higher floor. The new room was a little better, but it was till noicy. You could hear the noice from the ice machine, or the noice from someone in the next room...Elevators are very slow and breakfast is awful. After checking out i realized that i had forgotten my sunglasses in my room. I sent them an email next day, asking them to check in my room for that and let me know if they found anything. I got no answer for that;probably they dont care since i had already left."
169,1865,"Aug 14 2007	Will be back	The hotel was very conviently located, the staff helpful and cordial, and the room clean and quiet. I would recommend this hotel and plan to make this my headquarters for sightseeing, business and theatre trips when in NYC. We are always interested in keeping costs down but like to be within walking distance of major destinations. Ours are the Javitts Center for trade shows, the theatre district for overnighters, close to great shopping (for our teenagers) and close to the subway for sightseeing. Additional criteria on our list: complimentary breakfast, internet access and a business center, fitness center or pool, cleanliness and family friendly staff. The La Quinta met all our needs and expectations (no pool, but had no time to miss it). Thanks to the staff for a great stay."
170,1865,"Aug 4 2007 	Great Value Hotel	I stayed at the hotel from 1 - 7 July and I cannot rate it highly enough! The room was comfortable and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I went to New York by myself and the staff were always on hand to give me advice as to what to see and do. For the price of it, you get everything you need from a New York hotel, including complimentary breakfast, free internet access, a rooftop bar(if they are still doing the sangria, try some - its tasty but dangerous!!), and, for the fitness fanatics there is even a gym. It is also in a very handy location, being situated between 5th and 6th Avenues. It is a two minute walk from Macy's and a 10 minute walk from Times Sq.Next time I go back, i'm definitely staying at La Quinta - great value!"
171,1865,"Jul 23 2007 	Nice place to stay	My husband and I spent three nights at this hotel and were very pleased with the hotel, the staff, the room, etc... However, if you are looking for wonderful surroundings, the immediate area around the hotel is not so great. When we arrived, the taxi had to pull forward to unload our baggage to avoid a nasty mess of something in the street - but when we headed out a little later - the mess was gone, which we appreciated. There was a lot of trash along 32nd street, but the Empire State Building is just around the corner, and the area there is much cleaner and well kept.We ate at the Heartland Brewery in the Empire State Building and were very pleased with the food and the prices. The Rooftop bar at the hotel was also very nice and not too pricey. Times Square and Central Park are within easy walking distance and we only used the subway when we went out to Yankee Stadium and into Union Station Plaza. We would definitely stay here again."
172,1865,"Jul 19 2007 	Not bad for a family on a budget	Location was within walking distance to Times Square, Empire State Building and other areas. Room was clean and large enough that we were able to use a blow up mattress (we have 3 teenagers). We felt safe entereing and exiting the building each day and at night. The doorman was extremely helpful when we arrived, helping unload our vehicle and giving directions on where to self park. The front desk was friendly and helpful with the questions we had. The only complaint we had was the lady at the broadway shows window at the hotel wasn't very helpful and hard to understand, but the next day a different person was there that was much better. The hotel was pricey on broadway tickets so we went into Times Square and found the tickets we wanted (Rent) cheaper and with no problem. We would stay here again."
173,1865,"Jun 28 2007 	Medicore at best	Good location near Penn Station. Just a few blocks to walk from the station. Located in Korean section. Old, tired rooms, but they were clean. Breakfast area small, crowded, and poor selection of food items. Hotel staff not too helpful. Room averaged 145$ per night."
174,1865,"Jun 22 2007 	A very nice surprise	I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this hotel is. I stayed in a room with one queen bed and the room was a wonderful size. The furniture was in great shape and clean, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was very clean. The shower/bathtub was spottless and the shower head had wonderful water pressure. The room was quiet as I did not hear my neighbors or street noise (I was on the 5th floor). The continental breakfast was okay. They had the normal cold cereal, bagels, dounuts, juice..etc. Their health club consisted of two treadmills and two bikes (wish they had some kind of weights). Their business center which was next to the health club had three computers with free internet access. I felt very comfortable and safe as the hotel is 2 blocks from Penn Station. The only downfall I felt was how long you had to wait for one of the two eleavators. I would stay here again."
175,1865,"Jun 10 2007	Wow - big room!	We were dreading being crammed into a small NYC motel room with our two teens, but received a pleasant surprise! Our room - 1111 - was actually big. Also, wifi, great location, an easy walk with luggage to Penn Station, efficient staff, so overall we were very pleased. Only drawback was elevator kept breaking, so we used the stairs. Breakfast is limited to cereal, breads and yogurt. For excellent $3 breakfast go to Brooklyn Bagel Deli at the corner of 6th Avenue."
176,1865,"May 29 2007 	Simple Clean 	I have returned home from my Memorial Day weekend trip to NYC. The first night I stayed in the La Quinta Manhattan. Having never stayed in a hotel in New York before and having read many reviews for various hotels in Manhattan, I was prepared for anything. The area around the hotel was okay. It was a mix of industry and tourist attractions. The room was small but clean (no vermin). The bathroom was a standard hotel bathroom. I found the staff helpful. Since I was there alone this first night, I didn't venture out after dark. So, their Tv lineup was above average. They also gave you a nice little welcome package with candy, toothpaste, emergence-C, and coupons. Al in all, no complaints. It will be a very close and cozy stay if more than one person will be in your party."
177,1865,"Apr 22 2007 	Worried	the most special and lovely experience of all my years of traveling. La quinta is a warm welcoming place with great location or sighs and shopping areas. one concers thought is the breakfast room, the worker was not very kind when it comes to the guest needs. I wanted a drink and he refused to give it to me. Other than that every thing was excelent."
178,1865,"Apr 8 2007	No complaints at all	I stayed at La Quinta for 7 nights with my girlfriend last month and have no complaints about the hotel. Location is perfect, room was small but very clean, bathroom too, staff was friendly and helpful, nice rooftop bar, great complimentary breakfest, free wireless internet access. Would definately stay again and recommend to my friends."
179,1865,Mar 25 2007 	Great Location	This was our 4th trip to NYC and I am always looking for a good deal on hotels without getting a bad room. We read several of the previous comments from other guests left on this website. We saw that there were both good and bad comments and decided we check it out for ourselves. The lobby is very nice and yes the staff seems unfriendly but that is what the work ethic is like with the people working in the hotel. They are helpful and give you information as needed and it is their culture not to be friendly because they only are there to do the work. We were given information and never was anyone rude. When we entered our room we were happy with the conditions. It was clean and small but most of the rooms in nyc are small unless you want to fork over $400-500 a night in a swanky hotel. I have stayed in hotels with smaller rooms and not as clean in NYC before. For what I paid and the location of this hotel it was worth the stay. We went through La Quinta to make our reservations and fiqured if we were not satisfyed with our stay we would have contcted the corperate headquarters and asked for a refun on our rooms. Well we didn't have any complaints where we could demand a refund.
180,1865,"Mar 3 2007 	Horrible Hotel Unredeemed by Surly Staff	It is hard to know where to start my litany of woe regarding this particular establishment. The only positive that I can mention is the location convenient to Madison Square Garden &amp; the Empire State Building. On the negative side let me enumerate:1) GeneralThe hotel is run down &amp; in serious need of basic maintenance (not to mention renovation). The staff seem to make a valiant attempt to run a proper hotel, in spite of the 'Fawlty Towers' building. The rooms are dingy &amp; have water stains on the walls, although the room I had was quite large by New York hotel standards. Even when you put the 'maid service requested' sign on your door the maid may not bother to clean your room. At one stage I chased the maid, who had not cleaned my room for days, down the corridor just to get some clean towels. 2) Plumbing The plumbing in my room leaked in both the hand basin and the shower. The toilet did not flush properly (in spite of several visits from a surly &amp; overworked maintenance man) - I remained a afraid of using it for the duration of my visit. The shower hot water only worked after a visit from the aforesaid surly maintenance guy. The toilet made weird gurgling &amp; running water noises all day &amp; night, this wsa not ideal for sleeping.3) TV &amp; &quot;Free Hi Speed Wireless Internet&quot; The TV in my room initially did not work requiring a visit from the maintenance guy. Once working for free to air TV I decided to attempt watching a pay per view movie. Unfortunately my optimism was not rewarded - on the pay per view the sound did not work (even though the volume was set to full). I advised the front desk &amp; asked not to be charged for the movie.The wireless internet connection via ethostream is as slow as a dial up connection. I gave up on it &amp; picked up an alternative that was available in the area outside of the hotel.4) SummaryDO NOT stay at this hotel if you have a choice. It is run down and you can find better at about the same price in similar location."
181,1865,"Feb 16 2007 	Clean and Convenient	We spent a full week at La Quinta Manhattan and couldn't have been more pleased. We paid $121 a night (plus taxes) and when you consider the price included a nice breakfast, free internet in the business center, and a &quot;goodie bag&quot; with toothpaste, deodorant, etc., it was one of the best NYC bargains to be found. Our room was basic but very clean. The bathroom was small and appeared to be recently remodeled. There was no mildew at all -- that's one thing that I always check for. The bed was comfy, and our room overlooked the street. The location was ideal -- we could walk almost anywhere within a half hour, and there was a subway stop right at the corner for when we needed it. Penn Station was maybe 2-3 blocks away, which made it very convenient to reach JFK. There are numerous Asian restaurants on the street - we especially enjoyed a delicious Korean barbeque one evening and Vietnamese pho another. Macys and a wide assortment of shops are just a quick walk away, and the Empire State Building is just around the block. La Quinta is not luxurious, but it is clean and convenient, and I would definitely stay there again."
182,1865,"Feb 15 2007	Never Again !	This was the worst Hotel I ever stayed in my life. I hope I will not go through the same experience.The rooms are really DIRTY. They stink. They smell humid. The WC are unbelievable. You will not believe if I describe. Never seen before !!!! Needs urgently a sanitary inspection.Another point: Items forgotten in the room, disappear. Housekeeper never knows anything. This is a kind of a Hotel you will only suggest to your enemies."
183,1865,"Feb 14 2007 	BEWARE!! SCAM!! DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!	Booked the sister to this hotel, The Red Roof Inn Manhattan via hotel website (Apple Core Hotels), got a confirmation number and thought I was set. Then they called this morning to inform me they had made a mistake and I no longer had a reservation here and would have to stay at their other hotel located across the street, the La Quinta Manhattan. As you can see this La Quinta hotel has terrible reviews! When I arrived in NY I tried to talk to the staff at the Red Roof, explaining I had made the reservation, had a confirmation number, had paid for the room, all to no avail. I was sent packing to La Quinta. But after hauling my bags through the snow storm to this hotel, they said they could not accomodate me after all, since the person whose room I was to take had not checked out. It was outrageous. They shook their heads, too bad, and told me they'd made me a reservation at another hotel, which also had terrible reviews and where I would never have voluntarily stayed, then they told me I could take a cab there AT MY OWN EXPENSE. You cannot trust this hotel chain. And they won't care. Look elsewhere!"
184,1865,"Jan 30 2007 	Friendly front desk staff but an utter dump	Hotel Web sites sometimes employ pictures that do not accurately reflect the rooms. This La Quinta is no exception. The Art Deco lobby looked like it needed a good cleaning. The clerk was very polite and speedy in getting me set up for the night. Upon reaching my room, I saw that the door was partially open. Cautiously, I entered the room and was greeted with the overpowering aroma of marijuana. Overpowering, like someone had just toked up minutes before I arrived. I was prepared to call the front desk to complain but having arrived late and after a day of back-to-back business meetings, I just wanted to sleep. I decided to crack the window and air out the room. No luck. Window bolted. At this point, I noticed that the place looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in some time. Carpet was stained and worn. Bathroom was dirty. Walls were peeling. Smoke alarm looked like it got in a fight and lost. Badly. Oh and the locks on the door barely worked. I've stayed at lots of La Quintas all over the country. This one was by far the worst. Look elsewhere. The reviewer who posted previously about the nasty coffee maker wasn't joking. We must have stayed in the same room."
185,1865,"Jan 19 2007 	OK place but I will look harder next time	It was $300 for 2 nights (including taxes) thru AAA. Positives: It had a helpful front desk.staff, working elevators, breakfast&amp; coffee were good, no off odor or smells anywhere. Good fast computer center in basement (fine/free) (also a bathroom down there, folks!). I don't know about wifi, we didn't bring our laptop. Found out now that there was a cool bar/view on the roof. Darn! Very central location. Good parking (left side of street) for Valet. Cheap parking rate - $30 for 24 hours. No apparent bedbugs!Negatives: Rooms small. Doors thin/not a good seal so you will likely hear hall noises. I still slept ok though, and am a light sleeper (helped that it was an end of hall room). Small bathroom (shower only, no tub). The bed? fair.  The room coffee pot, though -that was disgusting - I could see tons of dust in it - tried repeatedly running just water though it to clean it out, but the gobs of crud(?) never stopped coming out. Front desk said they would send another coffee pot up, but I gave up after 15 min. and called down and cancelled and went to bed (just wanted hot water to make a cup of tea (my own)). Oh well. I also noticed dried up coffee splatter on the pot and on the wall behind it. Yech. Doing a final room check, I found a huge plastic hoop earring (2&quot; diameter) of a previous tenant. This should not have been missed by housecleaning.Overall: OK place. I will look harder next time and read more reviews to try to find more for the money!"
186,1865,"Jan 17 2007	Exceeded My Expectations	Id like to first point out a billing policy at this hotel that might affect other travelers who book multiple rooms. I booked two rooms on-line through the chains website and used my AAA membership in order to receive a discount. The discount amounted to $18 per night per room for two nights, or $72. At check in, I was told I could apply my AAA membership to only one of the two rooms; that the other room would be charged the non-AAA rate. In the next breath, the clerk said she would honor the AAA rate for both rooms if anyone else in our group of four had either an AARP membership or another AAA membership. We came up with a second AAA card and all was fine but beware of this policy if you book more than one room at the discounted AAA/AARP rate.I cant say enough good things about the staff. Every maid, bellman, clerk, server or maintenance person we encountered was polite and accommodating. There was an efficient busyness, but our requests were honored quickly including a toilet repair that was finished no more than 15 minutes after we called the front desk.Our bedroom was clean and so was the bathroom. The bedroom had one queen bed, a writing table, a straight-back work chair, a chest of drawers, cable television and a coffee maker. The room was small, but completely adequate. We requested non-smoking rooms and there was no lingering smell of smoke. The closet was tiny, with about eight wooden hangers, an iron and ironing board. The rooftop bar resembles a backyard or fraternity barbeque and there is an enclosed area for inclement weather. The bar is open from 5 PM until midnight, year round. Its worth a trip for the view of the Empire State Building, even for non-drinkers. A mixed drink was $5.The hotel is located in the middle of 32nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Broadway. Few places in Manhattan could be more convenient or more centrally located. There is a subway entrance on the corner of 32nd &amp; Broadway, and we had no problem getting a taxi. The free continental breakfast served coffee, juices, fruit, cold cereals, oatmeal, bagels, muffins, toast and doughnuts. We stowed three bags, as we arrived six hours prior to check-in, and stowed the same three bags for several hours after we checked out. There are two elevators which were neither particularly fast nor slow.Our bill at check out was exactly what we had been told it would be, with no hidden charges. There are four separate taxes in Manhattan on hotel rooms; two are percentage taxes, one is a flat $2 per night tax and the other one is a flat $1.50 per night tax that taken together added a fraction under 16.5% to our room rate.The hotel is in a block filled with Korean restaurants and businesses. Odd for Manhattan, there was no delicatessen on the street but we located one around the corner on W. 33rd Street with the usual deli fare and a breakfast special of a bacon, egg &amp; cheese sandwich and coffee for $2.We are budget tourists and this hotel was perfect for us."
187,1865,"Jan 16 2007	Book it - you'll be pleased you did!	We stayed at the La Quinta - Opal hotel in San Francisco last Sept, so really knew what to expect. We were not disappointed - yet again - a small but friendly hotel - really in the centre of Manhatten - and at bargain price. You just can't go wrong - the rooms are so much more pleasant than the usual 'travel inn - mass produced type' groups. Although the room was small - we were told about this on the booking detail sheet - but expected far smaller than it was - it was clean and pleasant. Anyway how much time do you spend in the room when out sight seeing all day. The location is fantastic - in addition to many other attractions mentioned in other reviews, there is 'Manhatten Mall' where the well stocked 'food hall' provides a variety of foods at reasonable prices. Some good shops too - right next to Macy's for a fraction of their prices!We would go again and again - don't want to tell too many people though as we love this group and the breakfasts are soooo good too. Toasted fresh bagels with cream cheese - WOW!!!!Go on - treat yourself - and enjoy !!!"
188,1865,"Jan 12 2007 	Good for the price in Manhattan - can't beat the location!	I've stayed at La Quinta twice, once in Nov 2003 and again in May 2006. I actually came to NYC in May 2004 and tried another hotel and went back to La Quinta as I was so disgusted with the other hotel. It is a very standard hotel - dont' go in hoping for it to be ritzy. It's clean and SO close to everything you want (Macy's, Victoria Secret etc.) it's right in midtown so you can't really beat it. The rooms are average in size and I've always managed to pay under $200 USD for a room with my AAA membership. That price is pretty standard for a middle of the road hotel in Manhattan by the way. It doesn' t have any great amenties, though the roof top bar is pretty cool (I didn't even know it was there the first time I went!). The Empire State building is practically across from street. (see pics) I've gone to NYC by myself and stayed there and felt very safe, the hotel is located in an area called Little Korea. I felt comfortable walking to the coffee shop alone after dark without one incident. If you are looking for a fancy place this isn't it, but if you want a clean, safe place to stay you can't beat La Quinta. Make sure you book the one in Manhattan though on West 32nd."
189,1865,"Jan 11 2007 	Loved La Quinta	Mixed reviews before we went but for a cheap hotel it was exceptional. It was in a very central location. We found helpful staff, very clean rooms, everything worked, breakfast okay, although our room was opposite the lifts we were not disturbed by noise and never heard a door slam in the four nights we were there, the roof bar was attractive with lights and heaters outside, only complaint was that it closed early while we (and others) wanted to stay longer."
190,1865,"Jan 8 2007 	No Frills with Lots of Frills	This is a no frills hotel with lots of frills--not the least of which is the price! I paid approx. $107 USD per night for a room with a queen bed. The room was very clean, and the bed very comfortable. (Hint: the extra pillows in the closet are in better shape than the ones on the bed.) No view, but the sound from the HVAC system in the courtyard provided a white-noise background and I slept like a top! Lots of towels, soap, shampoo, etc.--not the expensive spa brands, but they work just as well. The business centre in the basement has 3 working computers with web access and a monochrome laser printer, all at no charge! The fitness centre had 3 treadmills and 3 bikes in addition to a other equipment, also free. Complimentary continental breakfast has decent coffee, juice, toast and lots of other choices. Close to Penn Station, Macy's, 2 subway lines, and lots of reasonably priced Korean restaurants. If you are on a budget and/or luxury is not a must, this is the place for you!"
191,1865,"Jan 3 2007 	Great value...	My family and I travelled to NYC to see the Macy's Day Parade along with good friends of ours. We were very happy with the rooms. They were on the small side, however, we were only there to sleep. The rooms were clean and so were the bathrooms. We did take advantage of the Continental Breakfast one day and it was fine...fresh fruit, bagels, cereals,oatmeal, etc...We arrived early--about 11 am and they allowed us to check in which was great. They were also very gracious in allowing us to secure our luggage there after we had checked out, which allowed us to sightsee one more day before returning home. The price was around $180/ night (AAA rate)."
192,1865,"Nov 14 2006 	Great Hotel with Great Location!!	This hotel is perfect for the people who do not want super luxury and plan to only sleep, bathe, and relax a bit in the room. Our room was clean, comfy, and the hotel overall was beautiful and clean. The free internet cafe downstairs was a huge plus, the rooftop bar was awesome, and the free breakfast was great and had plenty to choose from. I dont know why people are so gripy on here about this hotel!? My husband and I loved it, besides we were out and about on the city for 14-16 hours a day and didnt even think about the hotel room until we needed sleep. I say go for it. Its a perfect location across from Madison Sq Gardens and Penn Station. We walked to Times Sq from our hotel and the Empire State Bldg is literally around the corner. This hotel is in Korea Town. Very quaint and cute. Basically just one street block. Great food too!"
193,1865,"Nov 8 2006 	Great location	I have just returned from a four night stay at La Quinta Manhatten with two friends. If you want a relatively cheap hotel which you aren't going to be spending too much time in, this is a good option.The best things about La Quinta Manhatten are the location (a stones throw from the Empire State Building and Macy's) and the rooftop bar which has friendly and helpful staff. It's a good value for money hotel, but you really do get what you pay for.Our room was clean but small, with no wardrobe space, which wasn't ideal for three girls who were in Manhatten to shop! The lift is possibly the slowest I've ever used. The outside noise wasn't great but is only to be expected when staying in the middle of the City.On our last day we left our suitcases with an extremely helpful Bellman so we could enjoy our last day. On our return in the afternoon, another Bellman was on duty. When we asked for our suitacases so we could pack the shopping we had bought before going out again, he informed us that he wasn't there to be passing suitcases &quot;backwards and forwards&quot;. It seems we were cutting in to his &quot;standing around doing nothing time&quot;. He was extremely rude and even shouted over the top of me when I went to speak to the Manager to complain. This isn't something I have ever experienced in any other hotel in the world, and is not acceptable. I would return to La Quinta Manhatten, and hope that in future they employ people who wish to assist their guests, not argue with them."
194,1865,"Oct 23 2006 	Comfortable reasonably priced great location	We have stayed at this LaQuinta twice now and probably will stay here again. The rooms are small but ours have always been clean and I have always found the man who takes care of the breakfast room to be very attentive and willing to go out of his way to keep the guests happy. You cannot beat the location, around the corner from the Empire State Building and I liked being able to step over to Macy's and other nearby stores for shopping. We also like Korean food and so we try to visit a different Korean restaurant on this street on each visit. The desk staff has always been polite. The elevators a a bit slow so we would sometimes walk down the stairs for a little more exercise."
195,1865,"Oct 5 2006 	Second time wasn't the charm	Came back to this hotel for a second time... lots of little annoying things on this visit have soured me on this place.Once again, the WiFi refused to work in my room. About the only spot on the floor that the WiFi worked was in front of the elevators. The plug-in jack inside the room didn't work at all. It was frustrating to try to get work done in this room.The curtains in this room hang directly over the air conditioner, so the air blows up into the curtains and the air doesn't circulate in the room. You have to try to balance things on top of the air conditioner to hold the curtain against the window so you can get some air in the room. That's annoying.It looked like the light fixture over the bed was being held in place with some push pins. I wasn't going to climb up there to find out.Yes, it's a mid-priced hotel, but now that there's a Holiday Inn Express and a Hilton Garden Inn among others in mid-town Manhattan, there are newer nicer properties in the same price range that weren't there a year ago. The La Quinta has a convenient location, but it needs a little maintenance."
196,1865,"Oct 3 2006 	Stay was okay	Stayed at La Quinta for 5 days -- got a AAA rate at $170 per night. Pretty decent compared to other hotels we researched. There was both positive an negative to staying here.Positive:- The location was very good, right in the middle of Manhattan, near great shopping (Macy's) and located close to subway lines. The hotel is located in &quot;Korean Town&quot; with a variety of Korean BBQ restaurants nearby. We ate at one of the $9.99 BBQ and sushi buffets on our first night in NYC..a great deal for all you can eat! There is also a small Korean Market a few doors down that you can purchase snacks and water at a reasonable price. - Staff was nice -- the latino maid was helpful and kept our room clean. Also, the staff at the breakfast was very good at keeping the place fairly clean and choices stocked. - The continental breakfast was decent and offered toast, bagels, pastries, cold cereal and oatmeal. There was also bananas and apples, and your usual choice of beverage: coffee, tea, orange juice, and a cocoa beverage (which I really liked). Overall, good for a light fare and getting you going in the morning. - Be sure to check out the rooftop bar at night, which has an excellent view of the Empire State building! We hung out there a couple of times because the view was so spectacular. The bartender was friendly, and the music was great. Negative:-Room was really SMALL. We stayed in an -02 room, and asked for an alternative room, but were told the hotel was booked. Be sure to ask for a larger room - or ask if you can see the room before you sign for it. It will be worth it, even if you have to wait for the room to be ready. The room was also very musty and smelled. I had to was all our travel clothes again because the smell came home with us in our suitcases. One plus was the bathroom, the shower had good pressure, and there was hot water all the time. - The rooms did not look like the room pictured on their website. I think the photo on their site was a suite. When we were at the rooftop bar, we could peek into the window of a neighboring room and saw it looked like the photo. But our room did not resemble it one bit.- I read in an earlier review that someone else had a problem with their room key. We had the same problem, and had to get our keys changed three times because it did not work. The front desk could not explain why. - The elevators were SLOW, I mean really SLOW! There are only 2 elevators to service everyone in the hotel. We took the stairs a couple of times because it was faster.- Our room did not come with wireless accessibility. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who spends little time in their room and wants a hotel to rest their head at night. There are no frills here. The location and value was good, though I would probably spend more $ and try another hotel next time."
197,1865,"Sep 30 2006 	Not the Ritz but acceptable	I almost cancelled my reservation because of some of the guest comments I read but I'm glad I didnt. The Front desk staff were most proficient and welcoming at check-in and gave us a great check-in amenity (which by the way came in handy as I felt a cold coming on). The room which was on the 6th floor was extremely small but very clean and had all its amenities working. My one complaint which I had to endure for the entire stay was no shower curtain in bathroom (despite reporting it) and a bathroom door that doesnt close.Overall I'm a Ritz Carlton guest but for my last minute, had-to-stay in Manhattan trip, the La Quinta Manhattan worked out ok."
198,1865,"Aug 12 2006 	I too was double-billed at La Quinta-Manhattan	I just hang-up the phone from talking with the front desk at La Quinta-Manhattan. I stayed there for one night last August 10. Today is August 12 and I saw on my credit card account that I've been billed twice, the first time when I checked in and the second time today at 2:30 am. In both cases, I've been charged for an extra $50 from the amount I signed on my credit card. I contacted the front desk at La Quinta-Manhattan, and not only they were unable to help me, but the clerk was rather rude and very patronizing--of a woman with an accent. He explained to me that I was being charged extra until it was clear that I had not incurred in extra charges, such as long distance calls, and that most likely I will be reimbursed next Thursday. Was that the extra $50? Although highly unethical to hold customer's money without warning (no breakdown on the credit card statement either of such charges), I granted that the extra $50 may have this simple explanation. But what about the extra $203.14? He told me to contact my credit card, that he couldn't see the double-billing on his computer. Today is Saturday, and the only thing I could do was to block my credit card from further charges. Meanwhile, we've tried to contact the manager of La Quinta-Manhattan, a certain Mrs. Sunni, but no response yet. It is Saturday, and she is not in her office. I've sent emails to La Quinta headquarters and to the Applecore &quot;contact us&quot; address online. It is Saturday and there is no way to get in touch with anyone. You can get robbed on a weekend and there is no one to help you out. We also called the NYC police, and they said they will call us back. It is now six hours later, 10:43 pm, and no call yet. It is Saturday and this is not an emergency."
199,1865,"Aug 2 2006 	Jury's still out on this one!	Let's start with the favorable things. Location...half a block from the Empire State Building, subway is close, Manhattan Mall is a block away. Room on the 12th floor was roomy, in fairly good condition, and cleaner than expected after our first night! The price was very reasonable for New York! They also held our luggage when we checked out until we were ready to leave the city in the late afternoon. They booked a great airport service to JFK for us. We were here two nights with four people the first night and two people the second night. We reserved non-smoking rooms through the La Quinta website. Now, the not so great things! When I checked in I was quoted a higher price because I didn't have my AAA card with me...it was circling the block until we could find a place to pull over and unload! When we arrived at our room on the fourth floor, it was TINY, a smoking room and icky. I went right back to the front desk to have the problem corrected. I was told the reservation didn't request a non-smoking room (even tho I had my confirmation specifying non-smoking) and that they had no non-smoking rooms available. We tried calling around to change hotels but everything was booked. We were stuck in this smelly, icky room! After spending $15 on room freshners and Febreeze, it still smelled terrible. We suffered through the night. We were up and out early to escape the smell. The second night they did give us a much better and bigger non-smoking double room. The elevators were very slow and sluggish. The overall condition of this property is dingy, and unkempt. The breakfast room had dusty lint on the wall above the food and the ceiling was leaking in several places near the food. Wireless internet was suppose to be available but it was not. Valet parking for one night was $38! Yikes! When we did check out, they did give us our reserved price and a 10% discount on the first nights room. Not much but at least it was something. I'm thinking it might be worth the extra money to stay somewhere a little cleaner and nicer."
200,1865,"Jul 26 2006 	If a business traveler...look elsewhere	La Quintas are usually nice but this one....not so good.I stayed at the La Quinta in Manhattan for a week in July 2006. I was there for business and expected a business type hotel. Their website stated they had Wifi but there wasn't. To check e-mails and upload reports I had to go down and plug my laptop into their switch down in the business center.The room was small and the carpet and curtains very dirty and old. The bed was horrible and the AC did not work well which made for a very rough nights rest.When you call the front desk at night nobody answers and when I called in the morning it took forever to get an answer.In addition, the elevators were slow and constantly malfunctioning.That being said, the location was great. The hotel is in the middle of everything and just a short walk from our company offices.This hotel may be good for tourists but not for the business traveler."
201,1865,"Jul 26 2006 	Nice Hotel	Myself and my husband stayed here in late June 2005 as a trip of a lifetime before the birth of our first childin NovemberWe checked out the reviews of lots of hotels and despite some bad reviews on here, decided to go with La Quinta as it was relatively cheap.We were not disapointed with our choice at all.The location is fantastic, subway at the end of the block, plenty of cabs going past and right near the empire state building.The room was fine, nothing fancy but when you are getting a cheap rate what can you expect? I would say the rooms are on par with many that you would find in the UK.We had a problem with the air con one day, I mentioned it to the front desk and when we returned from our day out it was fixed and working better than ever. I wasnt massively obviously pregnant at this point so I dont believe I was getting any preferential treatment.The free breakfast was OK, we only ate there a few times, preffering to sample all the other food delights new york has to offer.All in all I would recommed this hotel if you are looking for a reasonable cost hotel in an excellent location.PS I work in the hotel industry so am perhaps harder to please than most and I had no complaints!"
202,1865,Jul 21 2006	$139 a nite??	I am coming to NYC in 2 weeks and am getting a rate of $139 a nite at the La Quinta!! But the problem is that many of the other people who have left reviews have complained of bait and switch where the hotel refuses to honour the quoted rate.Anyone have any thoughts??i have stayedd at other applecore hotels in the past and was quite happy with their service..
203,1865,"Jul 4 2006	Stay Away from the la Quinta in downtown Manhattan	I stayed at the La Quinta Inn in Manhattan in June, 2006. I was very disappointed with my stay. When I checked in to the hotel they told me I had to pay higher rate than what I was quoted five months prior. I had a confirmaton number but they told me that i was quoted the wrong price. But in the end they went with my confirmation. The room was very small and it smelled terrible in the room. The carpet in the halls are very dirty and smelly.The elevators are as slow as a turtle. The free breakfast consists of old donuts , weak coffee, and dry bagels but it is free. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone not even my worst ememy. The only great thing about this hotel it has a good location in the middle of everything."
204,1865,Jun 28 2006	Great Value - No complaints from me.	Great location with the subway only a half block away. Desk service was very helpful. Rooms showed some signs of aging and could use sprucing up. Nights were quiet. Was a little disappointed in the bar - expected a quiet place but it was really a place for young singles. Nice continental breakfast. In the midst of Korean restaurants/stores. Try the Mandoo Bar for some great dumplings at super price.
205,1865,"Jun 2 2006	OK - But not much more	The location of the La Quinta is very good - just a few steps from Herald Square. The rooms are well maintained though small, which is to be expected in New York. Rooms facing the backside of the hotel look out to a small inner yard and are quite dark, espacially on the lower floors. We changed rooms from one of those to one facing the street because the smell from the restaurant next door was all over the room as it's air condition exhaust was just about 10 metres below the window. There is a pretty nice rooftop bar. If I were to stay there again I would ensure to book a superior room towards the front side."
206,1865,"May 27 2006 	Double-billed at LaQuinta New York NY	I stayed at the New York, NY LaQuinta in Manhattan. The room was average for New York City. The bathrooms are extremely small. I stayed there May10th -May 12th, 2006. The worst experience was the double-billing of the room charges. I was billed once on May 12th, then again on May 16th. After trying to resolve this issue with the desk clerk, I tried to contact the manager and left numerous voicemail messages, none of which were returned. I submitted an online complaint to LaQuinta's customer service, and was told they would have a response for me &quot;in a few days.&quot; I finally talked directly to the manager on May 23rd, who told me she would &quot;look into it and call me back by 2 PM that day. As of May 27th, I still have not received a return phone call nor has the charges been refunded to my account. Based on the above non-responsiveness of the management and unethical accounting practices, I do not recommend staying here unless you are paying cash. My issue is still unresolved and I the hotel owes me $218, which they have failed to address or refund."
207,1865,"May 23 2006	Great Stay	The La Quinta Manhattan is great value for money, We stayed there for 4 nights. Rooms were clean and tidy and staff were very helpfull.The free continental breakfast was great to get you started.Location is superb , close to subwayGreat roof top bar with stunnung views of Empire state buildingWould stop there again"
208,1865,"May 22 2006	Review of La Quinta Manhattan	My husband and I stayed here April 19th through 25th. Positives about the hotel: The price was reasonable, and the hotel was convenient to public transportation. There was a &quot;free&quot; continental breakfast available from 7am to 10am, and there was free baggage storage. The room and public areas were kept neat and tidy. The concierge was helpful. The person who cleaned the lunchroom was industrious. The desk clerks answered a lot of questions for us.My main concern was a feeling that there wasn't enough security. There didn't seem to be anyone whose job it was to keep non-guests off the guest floors or out of the breakfast area. When we returned during the day we usually found advertising leaflets shoved under the door of our room. To me this indicated that the street touts had the run of the hallways. The elevators that gave public access to the bar on the roof also stopped at all the other floors. I started to notice that while most of the hotels on the block seemed to have quite visible doormen we would come back to our hotel sometimes and there was no one outside or in the lobby except the desk clerks, who were stationed way off to the side. The concierge, when he was there, seemed to double as a doorman. I several times saw folks at the &quot;free breakfast&quot; who were filling plates full of food that they took with them. Again, like the elevators, there didn't seem to be a system in place to keep non-guests out of the breakfast area, which was off of the lobby. While there may have been surveillance cameras I would have felt safer seeing signs of security.I know that my attitude towards this hotel and to New York in general is shaded because my camera was lost or stolen between this hotel and the hotel room in the next hotel when we checked out. The last time I remember seeing my camera was in my hotel room, but I usually carried it zipped inside my purse. When we got to the next hotel I saw that my purse was unzipped and I didn't have my camera*. In searching for the camera I found that you always need to write down the medallion number of the cab you take just in case you do forget something. There is no central clearing house for &quot;lost and found&quot; either through the police or the taxi company.*Currently, my theory is that my camera was shaken out of my bag in the taxi I took on the way to the next hotel. When I checked Craigslist 'lost and found New York' I saw there were lots of people who report losing their valuables on taxis. Perhaps it is because when you reach your destination safely you are too busy kissing the ground to worry about your belongings? I also wonder if the taxi drivers dodge and swerve deliberately to shake stuff off their passengers?"
209,1865,"May 22 2006	Good budget hotel	My wife and I stayed 1 night in May 2006. I reserved the room on La Quinta Inn's web site. We had a very clean, spacious (by ny standards) room with an adequate bathroom. The mattress was a little old but we slept without difficulty. We were on the 5th floor facing 32nd street but found the double paned windows shut out all sounds but the garbage collection at 11:00 pm which lasted only a couple of minutes. There were no hitches in check-in or check-out. The room, with AAA discount, was $187.00 taxes included. The location is a little seedy but we did not feel any apprehension on the street at night. The staff were very pleasant and helpful in giving us directions to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. We heartily recommend this attraction. The number 2 or number 3 subway will take you to the entrance. We will stay at La Quinta Inn on our next visit to Gotham."
210,1865,"May 7 2006 	DEpressing!	I travel to NYC on biz very frequently. I happened to hit a very busy hotel week without advance booking ... almost every room in the city was selling for $299 plus a night.Decided to take a chance on the $179 room/ night rate for two nights at this hotel. The best features -- 2-block walk from Penn Station for those arriving from Newark on the airport train, and complimentary wireless access.Everything else was dismal. Arrived to find that they could not find my reservation. Stood at the front desk patiently for 20 minutes (with my online reservation confirmation in hand). Seems like they were encountering a communications breakdown with LaQuinta[-] Finally, the (minimally) English-speaking desk clerk handed me a key to my 5th floor room.The typical NYC small room featured:-windows that would not open (and a view of an old brick wall)-noisy window A/C unit that never cooled the stuffy room-a desk too tiny for anyone to work at-scuzzy old green carpeting (suspect for my sneezing &amp; allergy outbreak)-cheap, thin towelsThe hotel had two slow elevators and a basement fitness room that smelled of sewage. (There was an odd smell throughout the hotel ... like an unemptied grease trap.) I wasn't brave enough to try the breakfast room. (Starbucks and other options a couple blocks away on 5th Avenue.)There was a crowded rooftop bar which was nice for good weather evenings. Just be sure not to accept a room on the 14th floor where the bar traffic was noisy.The neighborhood? Bleak block featuring many Korean restaurants ... but only two blocks to Herald Square (Macy's!). Overall, a depressing place to sleep in NYC -- unless you just need a (relatively) clean bed to sleep for a few hours near Penn Station."
211,1865,"May 7 2006	Think twice before staying here!!	I booked a queen non-smoking at the La Quinta website for the AAA rate. What I got a was a tiny room with a double bed, with about a foot of space from the bed to the wall. The bed, bathtub and toilet were clean. The carpet was grimy and you can see mildew on the bathroom wallpaper. The free continental breakfast was fine. At check out, I told the front desk clerk that I booked a room with a queen bed, and she immediately responded that they had nothing smaller than queen beds in their hotel, but that some queen beds LOOK like double beds (note I hadn't said anything about a full bed to her at this point). When I got the bill, I was billed for the regular rate. When I brought this up, she did adjust my bill after making some rude remarks and making it sound like it was my fault to begin with (I did not cross check the rate at sign in and I did not show them my AAA card)."
212,1865,"May 2 2006	Beware - it is a scam with the low rates	I had a confirmed and guaranteed reservations at this particular property, when I checked in I thought something funny was going on as it was taking them a long time to fiddle with the reservation and then they come back and tell me that they cannot honor the rate I am booked under and wanted to charge me an additional $59.00 per night. Needless to say I was very upset, they mishandled the whole thing, conveniently no one in authority were available, all supposedly on holidays and could not speak to anyone,when they called the toll free number for La Quinta - yes they had my reservation and yet the Hotel would not honor the rateI honestly think it is a hook and bait, where they tell you the rate is low and when you show up they charge you the higher rate.Attitude was very poor and rude. Luckly for me I found another hotel that wanted my business and treated me with respect and dignity.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone at all unless you are chancing it and when you show up they will scam you. you can reach me at sben10@hotmail.com if you need further clarificationsthese people are part of the applecore hotels, and I really would stay away from all their properties."
213,1865,"Apr 25 2006	Perfectly fine.	The La Quinta Manhattan is great as far as hotels go. It has a decent bed, a clean bathroom, good temperature control and a TV. Yes, the rooms are tiny but that's to be expected in New York City. The location is great; you're right next to the subway, great shopping and some awesome nightlife. They are very helpful to their guests. They offer storage so you dont have to carry luggage around while waiting to check in or out of the hotel. If you are going to New York to walk around the city and not around your room, then this hotel is perfectly fine."
214,1865,"Apr 19 2006	Not bad at all	For NYC prices, the La Quinta was fairly inexpensive but offered a lot more than others in the same price range. It's very clean and well run, good location, and offers a nice continental breakfast too. It's central location couldn't be beat, as it's near to Penn Station and a couple subway lines, tons of food options, and great shopping. Very safe but busy night and day.I had a room on the 8th floor facing the street. Could be loud at times, but with earplugs I slept great. The room was clean, on the smaller side perhaps, but sufficient for 2 people. I had only small annoying complaints, such as the fire door constanly slamming shut through the night, the slow elevators, and how my room at first smelled of chinese take-out (several take-out menus were slipped under my door daily, so that explains it).Overall, I'd recommend it for families or budget travelers since it's a pretty good deal for what you get."
215,1865,"Apr 9 2006	good and bad things about it...	I recently stayed at the hotel and upon arrival, I thought it seemed like a great deal for the money. The lobby is nice and the staff is extremely accommodating and helpful. The only bad thing are the actual rooms. I got a room with one queen bed and it was the smallest room I had ever seen. Not to mention that you could hear everything. My neighbor came home at 2am and it sounded like he was coming into my own room and putting his coat in my closet. I heard people getting ice down the hall and there was an enormous space between the door and the wall. It seems once again that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is..."
216,1865,"Apr 6 2006	Exceeded Expectations	I lived in NYC for 21 years, so coming back and staying in a hotel was odd, but this place was a perfect choice. Our room was quite large by NYC standards, and it faced the back of the hotel so we had no street noise at all. Room was clean, well maintained, housekeeping did a nice job each day. The continental breakfast more than adequate (cereal, oatmeal, toast, bagels, donuts, juice, coffee, fresh fruit), fresh and constantly replenished.The location is also ideal: 2 blocks from Penn Station, so if you're coming by train, or taking the NJ transit train in from Newark airport, you don't need a cab. The subway was right around the corner, Empire State Building &amp; Macy's less than 2 blocks away. You can walk or take the subway 1 stop to Times Square, to Grand Central, basically to anywhere. The rooftop bar is very pretty and very quiet. The street is the heart of Korean restaurants, many open 24 hours, so it's very safe and you can get something to eat whenever. We had wireless internet access in our room, and in the basement is a business center with 3 working computers connected to the internet, as well as a printer so we could print out our return boarding passes. There's also a small gym that wasn't listed on the hotel website: 2 treadmills, a stair machine and a lifecycle.We did hear some guests complaining about the cost of parking. That's unfortunately normal for NYC, and even if you parked much farther away you really wouldn't get a much cheaper deal for 24 hours. And the 2 elevators are small, and relatively slow - not unexpected for an older building such as this.The baggage room was a big convenience, as we weren't leaving the city until 5 pm so we were able to lock up our bags and go enjoy the day.My ONLY complaint: I searched multiple websites to find the best price, and found out that other people had somehow gotten their rooms for even LESS than we paid. Not really the hotel's fault.All in all, I highly recommend this place, and will probably stay there again."
217,1865,"Apr 6 2006	Good value and clean	Stayed at La Qunita April 1-4 and found it met our expectations based on other reviews. Queen room was on the small side but the bath was almost as large. Clean and quiet, it met our needs nicely. Roof top bar is worth a visit for the view. Tips: wear comfortable walking shoes .. we did six miles on Sunday without trying!! MOMA was great."
218,1865,"Apr 1 2006	The La Quinta was clean well-maintained and a great value	We stayed at the La Quinta Manhattan October 2  9, 2005, and felt it was a great value for the money. Frankly, the reviews in Tripadvisor made us a little nervous, but when we got there, we were pleasantly surprised. The room was clean, a nice size for New York City, and fixtures and furniture were modern and efficient. The continental breakfast room was clean, and breakfast a great deal. The breakfast attendant was an extremely hard worker and kept the food supplied and tables cleaned. Yes, the hotel is in the middle of Little Korea (lots of Korean restaurants) and it does feel like you are in the middle of a concrete jungle, but that is part of the fun of the city. And we couldnt believe how reasonably priced the hotel was. Hotel rates have skyrocketed in New York City, but this place was still relatively affordable."
219,1865,"Mar 25 2006	Great Location!	I just got back from a 3 night stay at this hotel with a school group and would recommend it. It is in a great location with a subway stop on the corner and the Empire State Building and shopping (Macy's, etc.) nearby.It was very clean and quiet and the rooms are typical size for NYC (not huge, but adequate) and those ending in &quot;11&quot;, for example 711, 811, are larger than the others I saw. Try to avoid those ending in &quot;10&quot; - they are right across from the elevator.The continental breakfast was fine - bagels, toast, doughnuts, cereal and fruit, juice, coffee, tea, etc., but no protein. The bar on the top floor is terrific, very cozy and has an outdoor area. The view of the Empire State Building from the bar at night is well worth seeing."
220,1865,"Mar 23 2006	Gave our rooms away	We had booked two rooms at the beginning of the year for 5 nights from the 16th March 2006. When we arrived to check in we were told that our rooms had been given away because the credit card had been declined. On investigation with the credit card company, the reason it had been declined was due to the hotel inputting the expiry date round the wrong way. We had no phone call from them to warn us this had happened, the staff were extremely rude, they would not let us use a telephone to find another hotel. The manager never appeared the next day to make the complaint to. Whilst we were there 3 other couples had the same thing happen to them. I would say that if you plan on using this hotel, that they have the credit card details exact, and if you are from another country that you ensure that have the exp date the right way round."
221,1865,"Mar 2 2006	Great location and great deal!!	We just stayed at this hotel last week Wed. through Sat. and we really thought it was in a great location. We were half a mile from Times Square, two blocks from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, half a mile from Grand Central Station and there was plenty of subway stations right around us. This hotel is not on a pretty street and yes they do put out trash every night but we felt safe and the hotel was clean. The staff were very helpful and gave us lots of hints on things we wouldn't know about. They also have a room to lock up your luggage which was a life saver for us because we were late getting to a game when we arrived in New York and they locked up our luggage until we could return then when we checked out we didn't leave until 5:30 p.m. so they stored it for us again. This was a great convenience. The room was not very large but we were at the back of the hotel and did not have much of a view, it was a view of a building but by being at the back we never heard anything! It was extremely quite. The free breakfast was great and they had fresh fruit which was nice to be able to grab a piece to snack on during the day. I would definately stay here again especially if we could get the wonderful rate of $89 a night again!"
222,1865,"Feb 21 2006	really dissappointed in room.....also too far away from things	myself and my daughter booked a room here for 3 nights and 4 days...... hotel lobby was runned down and very trashy on the outside. Our room view was of the building next door, (basically an alley) filled with trash etc. Had to call room service for maid cleaning twice in one day, we came back from sightseeing at 6pm and room still hadnt been cleaned. I think the bathtub should have a mat in the bottom to keep from slipping as my daughter did.... we both felt very unsafe at this hotel and we will not recommend this hotel to anyone else... also, we checked in late and had to stand in line for 2 hours before being checked in,there was only one other person in front of us.... not enough people working at the front desk....."
223,1865,"Feb 14 2006	Perfect for a City Break	We stayed in the La Quinta Hotel in January 2006 for a 3 day break to New York.Quite frankly, for a budget hotel in a great location you can't get much better than this.The rooms were a fair size and very clean, the location was excellent - just around the corner from the Empire State Building and within walking distance of Fifth Avenue, Broadway, Times Square. The Rooftop Bar is lovely, really chilled, lovely staff and great views of the Empire State Building.The hotel even has a gym (if you have time for it!) and free internet access (great for checking in for your flight on-line!).This was our first time in New York and we can't wait to go back again &amp; if we go again we will definitely stay here."
224,1865,"Feb 11 2006	Loved the hotel and location	after reading some reviews about La Quinta Manhattan I wondered had we better change our booking.Glad we didnt,it was excellent!Check in went really well,we were given two queen beds,the staff were very courteous and friendly.We were on the tenth floor,just across from elevator,some noise was experienced but that happens in lots of hotels.We were pleasantly surprised at the space we had(again after reading some critics)closet space was small but what the heck.The hotel bar with its view of Empire State Building was a bonus.Breakfast was ok,you could eat your fill as everything was replenished as quickly as it was used.It was certainly up to our expectations and we will return later in the year if possible.We stayed there 27-31January 2006."
225,1865,"Jan 18 2006	Perfect Location and Great Price	This hotel has a perfect location and is very clean. Check in was a breeze and staff courteous and very helpful. Roof top bar was enjoyable, indoor/outdoor seating you can enjoy gazing at the Empire State Building next door. Macy's and Daffy's are just around the corner as is the subway. Cabs are always passing by and easy to flag down. Room was decorated nice and most importantly as two females we felt safe and the room was very clean. Would select again for future trips. Free continental breakfast."
226,1865,"Jan 10 2006	Honest Deal for the Money	My husband and I stayed there on January 4th and 5th of 2006. We were not totally convinced with the reviews we had read previously but we decided to give it a shot anyway since we got a special promotional fare through Expedia. The people at the lobby were very friendly and available 24 hours. There was also a place by the entrance where we could store our luggage. This was really convenient, especially the day we left because after checking out at noon, our bus wasn't before 9pm and we got the chance to leave it there the whole day at no extra cost. The employees in charge of that locker were also very nice and it was a good thing we were able to take in or out our bags at anytime in the day.Concerning the room, we were a bit disappointed by the one we got on our first night. Everything was clean, but it was just so tiny we barely could walk around the bed. We had quite a few pieces of luggage as well and had to store it all in the little compartment of the room where was the ironing board. We actually were supposed to stay at La Quinta only one night but decided to stay one more to enjoy more of NYC. I had told the people at the lobby in the morning after our first night and we were expecting the room to be done by the maid when we came back at night. However, this was not the case and the people at the reception told me for some reason the message didn't go through! I was surprised when the guy at the lobby told us he could have somebody bring us new sheets and towels! That would have meant that we should have done our room ourselves! I simply told him I didn't agree and he kindly accepted to change us to the room right next to our first room. The fact our first room wasn't done actually made our day. The second room was much bigger. It was as nice and clean as the first one but we really had more space, especially the bathroom which was about twice the size as in the other room.Finally we found convenient the free internet access downstairs and the breakfast was pretty good as well, enough to get us going until lunch. You only have to wake up early cause they no longer serve it after 10 am.All in all, we would definitely go back to La Quinta on another stay in the City."
227,1865,"Jan 5 2006	We're going back!	having read some of the reviews here today, I just can't believe my eyes. We stayed here for St. Patricks Week in March and we're defintely going to stay here again when we visit the states this year. Initially, we were put in a very small room that backed onto what sounded like generators but after we complained following a sleepless night, we were accomodated in a much larger, front facing room with lots of space. The maids were friendly, and i can't sing the praises enough of the Concierge at the time, he even lent my partner his own dinner jacket when we went to eat in a restaurant that required same. I can't speak for the breakfast, we never got up in time, jetlag! but i found 2 good delis at each end of the street that served our needs very adequately and a really gorgeous Italian Restaurant about 2 blocks down that we hope to find again. It's not the ritz, but for 120 dollars a night, it was worth every penny!"
228,1865,"Dec 14 2005	EXCELLENT	This was a great choice. You certainly were not pampered, but you had everything you needed. Clean, with instant hot water, good breakfast in the morning. The rooms weren't that big. but had everything you needed, the TV was MASSIVE, far too big for the room, but I suppose that's the American way. It's central to everywhere, the roof top bar has a great view of the Empire State building which is next door. Don't know about the internet access, was on holiday so didn't care, would definately go back, and if you see the wee Korean woman sunning herself on the sidewalk, just down from the hotel, throw her a dollar, she could do with a wash."
229,1865,"Dec 8 2005	Perfect for what we needed!	I didn't check Advisor before we booked so when I did check i was really worried with some of the comments about this place. But really there was no need.It completely did what we needed it to do. It was a base which we were not going to spend an awful lot of time in to relax or go to the gym etc. It was in a perfect location pratcially next door to the Empire State Building and at the end of the block is a subway station, 2 mins away from Broadway and Macy's - what more did you need!Ok - the carpet could probably do with replacing and the breakfast is not silver service but it was fresh with a great selection. The staff were friendly enough but the lift was really slow. Internet access was free too in the business centre.One tip - check what is on at Madison Square Garden before you go - we managed to get to see Bon Jovi in concert - MSG is literally across the road! And if you want a great view but the queue is too long at the Empire State go the the Rockefeller - you get a great view of the Empire State Building (which is lovely when it's lit up at night) and you wouldn't see it otherwise!!New York is my number one city - top of the list! I don't generally go back to the same destination twice but this place is definitely worth a second visit."
230,1865,"Nov 22 2005	Even Girlfriend Thought it was Fine.	The girlfriend and I stayed here in late August and found the hotel was just fine. I expected the worst due to some of the reviews, but was satisfied in light of the very reasonable price. Yes, the place could use some new (and different color) paint. But, the room was clean and quiet, if not a bit on the small side. The bathroom was also tiny but, again, clean. The only smell I noticed in the hallways was of an old, well-used hotel. The air conditioner worked fine. We loved the rooftop deck/bar w/its amazing view of the Empire State Building. The bellmen both days were very friendly and helpful. I had no problem w/the front desk staff--but I didn't have to ask them for anything, either. As for the neighborhood, we never felt it unsafe, though it's a little dark and secluded at night. I would have no problem staying here again if attending a game at the Garden (a 5-min. walk), and might stay here again for a weekend if I got the same great deal. But, w/so many other choices, I likely would try another part of town and hotel for variety."
231,1865,"Nov 8 2005	The reviews had me scared.....	I had booked the La Quinta Manhattan in August 2005,and have been steadily reading the reviews of this Hotel.. I must say I was scared the entire plane flight of what I was going to find when we got there.Check in was a breeze, and yes the elevators were a bit slow, but it is an older building. No bad hallway smells, and our room looked directly out to the Empire State Building. We had 2 comfortable Queen size beds, and a room big enough to accomodate 4 adults with large suitcases. The room and bathroom were clean, with fresh towels and cleanings everyday. I called for 2 more pillows about 8pm one night and had them within 10 minutes.Breakfast was just fine, donuts, bagels, cold &amp; hot ceral and juice and coffee. If you don't like anything, there are plenty of McDonalds and Starbucks around.(the hotel's b-fast is FREE)So, I must say, all my weeks of worrying were not worth it. I have no complaints.. I especially liked the price we paid for it. No, It's not the Plaza or the Ritz, but it was clean, and a great place to sleep after touring all day."
232,1865,"Nov 7 2005	Enjoyed our stay	I just spent two nights at La Quinta Manhattan with two of my grown daughters. The hotels in New York were booked pretty full because of the marathon. We chose LaQuinta because of the price, which was not real cheap, except by New York standards. They quoted me $100 a night under the Comfort Inn. I refuse to pay $400 or more a night just to sleep. However, I was very pleased with this hotel, as were my daughters, who are both flight attendants and have stayed in hotels all over the world. We had a room with two queen beds and it was large and roomy, and the bathroom was very nice and larger than I had expected with plenty of hot water. The room was very clean and very nicely furnished. Of course, we had a view of a building next door, but we didn't spend time in the room looking out the windows anyway. We had a very nice breakfast. We found the entire staff to be friendly and helpful. Of course we didn't make any unusual demands. I would advise anyone who requests the AARP rate to be sure to have your AARP card with you or you won't get the discount. This hotel was only the second in many years to actually require me to present my AARP card.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who travels on a budget and is satisfied with a nice clean, comfortable room in a good location."
233,1865,"Nov 4 2005	Ignore bad reviews hotel is adequate. So the customer service is bad..	You cant leave one star reviews because people were rude to you. I actually thought the staff was unhelpful but what do I care? its just a place to sleep. nothing ordinary but clean. not the best area in manhattan in terms of beauty or eating out but youre on top of transportation. nothing fancy but clean and well worth the price. at least it isnt a roach motel which is something you have to worry about in manhattan. another hotel (small) you might look into is the riverside towers, upper west side, great area, tiniest room imaginable but clean and cheap. books up fast."
234,1865,"Oct 26 2005	Never again	My boyfriend and I stayed here in May of 2005 over Memorial Day weekend. The best thing this hotel had going for it was the proximity to the train station.The staff is so rude. I've been to NYC many times and always heard the myths about rude New Yorkers. I think they all work at this hotel. The room had a funky odor to it and when I was getting ready for bed the first night, I pulled back the sheets to find blood stains on the sheets. I immediately called the front desk and had the sheets changed. On the second night, I pulled back the sheets to again find blood stains. I wouldn't let them change the sheets the third night because I was afraid of what I might find. Our room was right across from the ice machine and it was noisy noisy noisy all night long.I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. I'm sure that there are much better hotels for the $150 a night that La Quinta costs."
235,1865,"Oct 25 2005 	Terrible customer service; all they care about is $$$	My husband and I would both advise travelers to avoid the La Quinta Manhattan. We had a five-night stay in late October 2005 and witnessed firsthand how terrible the service is.I should preface this review by saying that we have stayed in several NYC hotels in the past, and are past residents of NYC -- we know that not all rooms will have a stellar view, and one might get a room that overlooks an airshaft. Be prepared for this, and remember that many, many people in NYC have apartments with similar views. Also, many, many hotel breakfast rooms use styrofoam plates and, yes, these plates may melt when hot toast is put on them. I mention these things because these are some of the complaints that have been lodged against the La Quinta by other Trip Advisor members. These are things that will occur at any NYC hotel in this price range, and travelers should expect this.Our complaint about the La Quinta is their inattention and indifference to customer service. At times the staff members were unquestionably rude. Examples:We had a plumbing problem that took 2-1/2 days to fix, because the front desk did not communicate at all with the engineer about what the problem really was. They wasted his time and ours. He never came with the right tools, and couldn't even fix it in the end.The housekeeping staff dumped a pile of soaps and shampoos in our room the first day, and never monitored the supply again.The employee running the breakfast room was surly and sometimes downright rude. The coffee/hot water machine was difficult to figure out and there were no instructions. If this employee encountered anyone wondering how to use the machine or having a problem with it, he chastised them in a voice loud enough for everyone in the room to here. On October 24th, we heard him sarcastically ask people that he was &quot;helping&quot; with this machine, &quot;Can't you read English?&quot; He did this three times! (Many of the guests at the hotel were not native English speakers, but the way the coffee maker worked was not apparent even to those of us who were.) When my husband accidentally spilled some coffee and burned his hand, this employee made rude jokes about the incident as he cleaned up.The man running the gift shop where one could buy tickets for an airport shuttle bus tried to con my husband into making a reservation without revealing what the price was. My husband's first question had been, &quot;How much is it?&quot; and this man did everything in his power to get my husband to sign up for the shuttle without answering the question. (The shuttle was $45 one-way to LaGuardia airport. We used a cab and paid $27 each way, including tip and tolls! Obviously, a much better deal!)Hot water in our room was dependent upon the demand in other rooms. At times, tepid water was all that we could get, in the shower and the sink.The remote on the TV did not work well.The room door was difficult to open, with metal scraping metal on the bottom of the door frame.All this for between $219 and $329 per night.We will not stay at the La Quinta Manhattan again. Never!"
236,1865,"Oct 16 2005	Dont stay here	We had a 3 night stay in New York , at the end of a holiday in Canada.The La Quinta, first put us into a room the size of the bed with a foot and a half walk around it. No room even for our bags, the tiolet didnt flush, the aircon. didnt work and our room overlooked brick walls and fire escape.On the second day after a sleepless night due to the heat, we requested another room, which we were given without hesitation.The second night was better only due to plumbing problems the whole hotel was without water for the day,the aircon. didnt work for anyone in any room for longer than an hour or two, and everyone in the hotel complained about one thing and another in lifts or were ever we met one another.Breakfast was served on plastic plates and cuts, which melted when toast was placed on them . All in all i would suggust anywhere else, paying in mind that it was extemely expensive for us coming from Australia $1000 for 3 nights, I believe it is even more expen=sive to stay elsewhere.I also wouldnt recommend staying mid town, its way too frantic."
237,1865,"Oct 4 2005	Could have done better	This was my first time staying at a hotel in Manhattan, so I can't really compare it to anywhere else, but I think I could have done better. The first half of our trip we stayed with friends downtown and it was much nicer. As others have noted the room was extremely tiny. Just large enough that you can walk around the queen sized bed. I thought the bathroom was an okay size relative to the room. The staff was not very friendly (except for the maid who was very nice). It took about 45 minutes for them to send an extra pillow to my room, even though I physically went downstairs instead of calling so I would not have to wait for them to send it (they would not give it to me downstairs).The worst thing about this hotel is the location. Yes it is close to the Empire State Building, Macys, and Times Square, but the only restaurants nearby are Wendys and Burger King around the corner, and about 20 Korean BBQ places. If you're not in the mood for Asian or fast food, you're out of luck. Next time I will stay somewhere closer to some nice restaurants and good night life. The positive aspects of this hotel is that our room was clean and the free breakfast in the morning had some good choices. They had signs up that you weren't supposed to take the breakfast items to your room &quot;in order to help keep our hotel clean,&quot; which I ignored. If I want to eat in my $150 hotel room, I will eat in my hotel room!"
238,1865,"Sep 25 2005	Great location and this hotel is fine for me	The first thing I'd like to say about this hotel is what a great location! For staying in Manhattan you really can't do better. The location is about 30 seconds from the 34th St station on the NQRW lines (yellow) good for going downtown, and the other way you can get to Times Sq and change for most places. Oh, and by the way, Macys is about 60 seconds walk and Century 21 just a few stops away on the subway.Back to the hotel, we paid about $150 per night in April, which I think was expensive (but not so expensive as other places!). The room was fine (a fridge would be nice guys), TV great, but the breakfast room did get a little busy (OK it was way too small, but this is probably usual for budget hotels. Ali thinks that this is a real problem, but I still think that you get what you pay for)The local shops are open late, which is nice when you want something.It's got wireless and wired broadband but it is in the usual hotel style. Email and http(s) work fine but forget pdfs or downloading other file types or installing from the net (and this can be a REAL pain).Inspite of these minor issues I would recommend it with one reservation. Make sure you get to breakfast early!"
239,1865,"Sep 17 2005	Bad Bad Bad	My wife and I had reservation for 4 nights. we left after 4 hours when we decided it is so bad that we'd rather go to my uncle who lives in N.J.The area is bad and dirty, when you get out of the taxi you start feeling bad. The staff is rude and unhelpful. The rooms: first they took me to a smelly room that even though I smoke myself the smell was imbareable for me- so we asked another and got a room the size of my home bathroom. Than we decided to leave but they still charged us for the night after a loud and angry conversation.Stay Away"
240,1865,"Sep 8 2005 	Never Stay Here	PLEASE, DO NOT STAY HERE. The halls smell of Indian or Oriential food at all times. The staff is not helpfull at all. The Maintenance department is worthless. I stayed in this hotel for Buisness and regret it. The Wireless Web is non-exesistant and all of the rooms do not have wired web. If they do then it is as slow as dial up. In the first 2 days I was in 3 rooms. The first was size wise fine but the AC would not work. The Second was a Handicap room but no Web Access. The Third was room 1002. I dont know of a smaller room that I have ever stayed at in my entire life. You could barely walk around the bed. The Desk&quot;table&quot; was in a corner alcove opposite the dresser with the TV on top with enough room for a chair. You just couldnt sit in the chair. Glad I had a long ethernet cable to sit on the bed with my laptop. The shower had a nozzle that only sprayed you in the face. If you wanted to really rinse, you had better let it drip. The staff only had the &quot;Authority&quot; to give me a &quot;10% Discount&quot; on the first night. The manager whom I called later(2 weeks) offered another 20% on the first night only. This is not the first time I have stayed there, but it is certainly the last. My travel agent,who is a manager with STA Travel will spread the word within her organization to never book anyone there at all."
241,1865,"Sep 3 2005	Overall Happy with this stay!!	Having heard so many horror stories about New York hotels, I was prepared for the worst. It took me about 2 1/2 weeks researching various hotels before I finally decided on the La Quinta. The rates were great compared to other hotels in the area; the location was fantastic!! The staff (from housekeeping to the front desk) did not seem very approachable or friendly, but that did not bother me. They left me alone, and I left them alone. The room was surprisingly clean, except the carpeted floor when we got there, BUT they did vacuum and clean daily, which was a plus. The bedroom and bathroom was TINY, but that is typical in New York anyway. The room was just a place to camp out at night while we explored the city in the daytime so it didnt matter at all. Internet conn was good most of the time. The rooftop bar was nice with view of the Empire building. The breakfast was ok with the typical bagels,donuts, coffee, etc..But hey if you want bacon and hot eggs maybe try the millenium hilton instead....The only problem we had which wasny that much of a big deal was the slow moving elevators!! At least there were were chairs in the lobby right next to it, so that you can sit and wait the 5 minutes for it to come. Great location, good value, clean..What more can you ask for? Would I stay there again? If the rates stay low, I think I definitely would book again in the future."
242,1865,"Sep 3 2005	Pretty Average	The hotel was extremely convenient to all sights and had a wonderful view of the Empire State building at night from the bar. However, we were in a room at the back which had no light and was very depressing. The room was clean but very basic and small. The staff were rather unhelpful and not particularly pleasant but the continental breakfast was surprisingly extensive."
243,1865,"Aug 31 2005	---- Bigggg time............	This hotel was absolutly horrible. The staff was 100% rude. I mean all of them not just one either. When I complained, not one word was mentioned about making it better or whatever just so! The place was way too small, painted a horrid shade of asylum green, two elevators that it takes forever to get on due to the large amount of people. Stank to high heavens, air conditioner didnt work right. When calling housekeeping to ask for extra things like more than one towel (that was all the room had one towel and three washrags draped over the bathtub) told they would be up never did show called a second time an hour later told another few minutes finally the third time they sent someone up with one blanket. We requested two pillows and three towels, no blanket. When we told the person that we were told we should have told them right on the phone. VERY RUDE!!!! I do not recommend this place at all... Find somewhere else. The comfort inn which we switched to was very nice, very accomodating no problems."
244,1865,"Aug 29 2005	Great Location and good price	I stayed here for four days in August 2005.Great location for shopping and easy connections to all NYC.Its a &quot;korean street&quot; plenty of nice restaurants.They gave me a nice, no-smoking room on the 12th floor.Room complete and clean with two good queen beds. A/C worked fine.Bathroom complete and clean. Lots of water, great shower.Wireless internet did not work with a weak signal, but it was solved with a wire connection under the desk.TV 27&quot; plenty of channels.Business and Fitting center under refurbishment, so closed.Corridor carpets need replacement, but is a common problem in a lot ofhotels. I do not know why the architects do not use ceramic tiles.Elevators small, clean and not very fast but who needs speed there?Included breakfast basic but good quality.When compared to other hotels in NY, it's cheaper.I would probably stay there next time."
245,1865,"Aug 18 2005	At least it was clean!	After reading some of the reviews posted on this website, I was really nervous about staying at this hotel. My boyfriend and I came to New York for my birthday the first weekend of August 2005. While the staff wasn't overly friendly, it didn't bother me too much because they still fulfilled my requests. A simple question, asked nicely by me, allowed for kindness in return from the staff. They gave us numerous room options to choose from, and even told us which rooms were already clean so that we could check in early if we chose to. Granted, the rooms were small, but our room and our bathroom was clean. And in New York, at a 2 star hotel, that's more than you need! :-) We stayed in room 605, and I think the television in that room was possessed! Everytime you turned it on, it turned itself back off, until it decided it wanted to cooperate -- usually about the 3rd or 4th time of pressing the power button. But who watches much t.v. anyway? The air conditioning system worked great! The water pressure in the shower was good, and the room was clean. We were hardly ever in the hotel, and in New York, it's all about location anyway, right? The location was great. We were a 5-10 minute/$5 dollar cab ride from most of the things we chose to do while we were there. And naturally, I had a wonderful time for my birthday weekend in New York.So, if you don't mind being in an older model hotel, I would recommend this one to you --- the savvy traveler who would rather spend more of his/her money on things to do, as long as the place you stay is clean."
246,1865,"Aug 10 2005	Don't bother the staff-you're only a guest	my sisters and i stayed at the laquinta hotel in late july, and i doubt i'd ever stay there again. the hotel is a remodeled older hotel and has a very nice front entrance. it is on a street known as little korea. the rooms and rest of the hotel are satisfactory, but the bathroom exhaust fan was so noisy, it was like being on a runway at laguardia. we checked in at 11:00 &amp; went out until 5:00 (check-in is 3:00) and our room still wasn't cleaned upon our return. i specifically asked for enough towels for three, but still had to put in a call to the front desk for a few more. which brings me to the staff-they treat you like you are a minor intrusion to their day. they spoke to guests as little as possible; needless to say, i avoided asking for much. they made an error on my bill, &amp; left a message on the room phone telling me i owed them .50 cents (i didn't). there was a $1.50 per day tax on the bill for the javits center-wasn't sure why, but i was sure i didn't want to ask that staff!"
247,1865,"Jul 24 2005	replace the staff	Location perfect, Price perfect , breakfast good,but the hotel needs a be updated. Everyone of the staff was useless or worse still, they were rude.On arrival the person on front desk was abusive to a customer who had to go behind front desk to retrieve his credit card. The customer remained v. polite, but left to stay elsewhere. If you stay at this hotel the less you have to do with the staff the better."
248,1865,Jul 18 2005 	Good for the Price $139	For a two star hotel and $139 a night this was a good hotel. It was clean and included a continental breakfast. I am not sure if I would pay much more than that if there were other better options. I couldn't find anything better for that price during the time. The service was ok and I am very low maintenance. Some reviews complained about the elevator being slow. During peak times it is. While off peak times I didn't notice any problems. It is located in a great location. If you are looking for a clean budget hotel this will work. If you are looking for amenities this would be on the low end. I would stay there again for the right price.
249,1865,"Jul 17 2005	disappointed	When checking in DO NOT agree for a room # 15 (e.g. 915,1015 etc.) It's the tiniest room and it is not for 2 persons. If you paid normal amount, not some discounted price, that's it. We paid for such room 179$ for a night, but we could not argue loud enough to get us 2 a bigger one, although we got a bigger one for the 2nd night. That second room was fine.Windows in the most rooms look at the wall of the opposite buildings, so there is no view in any rooms I guess.Hotel is located on some kind of chineese street with all the chineese restaurants/shops around. Location is good, right down the Empire state. But be advised that Empire State building is NOT the center of NY! It just one of the attractions. Most stuff happens at Times Square, where also many bus city tours start and end. So if you plan to use bus tours and you should consider staing closer to Times square, otherwise you will have to walk (not far, but still). On the other side, walking NY streets is quite nice - that's what NY is really about is not it? Macy's is very close.Ah, the corridors and especially the so-called buisness center (a room with 3 computers with free internet) smell really really bad. The smell is fine in the rooms though.No cockroaches spotted. Breakfast is pretty limited - coffie bread fruits."
250,1865,"Jul 12 2005	Very comfortable	When we arrived we were happy to see it was a historical landmark. They did a very nice job in modernizing it. The clerk was preoccupied with other things and barely spoke to us. She didn't even tell us about the continental breakfast, the custodian on the elevator told us about it. The people that worked there were not helpful nor friendly (I guess that's NY). Our room was 1102 and the air conditioner did not work very well (sure glad it wasn't Summer)! The room was small but very comfortable and a good deal for the money and the location was very central for everything we wanted to do. If I stayed there again, I would make sure the air conditioner worked before I trekked all the way up to the room."
251,1865,"Jul 4 2005	Not bad	Our tirp to New York was just for one night and two full days. We were supposed to stay at Hotel Newton but they lost our reservation. So glad I called the day before our arrival or else we would have been stuck. We decided to give LaQuinta a try since we had a good experience with this chain in New Orleans.The hotel staff were very friendly, accommodating, and helpful. They allowed us to check in early which was much appreciated since we left home at 3a.m. to get a 6a.m. flight from Buffalo to JFK. The room was small but very clean. The air Condition worked fine but I did encouter one person who had trouble with their a/c unit. The price was great and the breakfast was okay. I would certainly stay there again."
252,1865,"Jun 12 2005	Too many drawbacks	We stayed here June 4 - 9 after reading reviews on tripadvisor. Got a good rate through the applecorehotels reservations site. We arrived early, and were told a room was ready, but if we came back later we could get a larger room. We had tickets to a matinee, so we came back at 5:30pm and received a slightly larger room. The room was a smoking room, very smelly, and on the second floor (I had asked for a non-smoking room on a higher floor). The weather was hot and sticky the whole time we were in New York and the AC in the room was blowing air, no cooling. We called about this and maintenance came right away and flushed the system, telling us that it would cool down soon. After 30 minutes, there was no change. We called again and asked if we could be moved. The front desk said the hotel was sold out and they would have maintenance check on it again. After another 30 minutes and no maintenance person, we called applecore to see if they could help us (either move us to another property or get us another room). They said they would see what they could do. We left for dinner and talked to the front desk. They assured us they would get it fixed or move us.When we got back the room was frigid! We didn't dare adjust it the rest of the stay. So not a great impression upon arrival. But at least it was cool.The pros: price ($149 per night), breakfast included (well stocked and adequate quality), free wireless connection (easy and fast), location (access to several subway lines within the block and more just one avenue away) and rooftop lounge (right below the Empire State building).The cons: smoking room was more than Fabreze could handle, interior room had awful dark view (couldn't even tell if sun was out), countertop in bathroom was too long and you could not sit on the toilet without leaning to the side (and I'm not fat!), bed comfort and linens were below par (and I know not to expect much), tub was very slippery (we had to put a wash cloth down for traction), and the maid service was spotty (at different times there was no bath mat, no hand towels, no tissues, etc.). The TV remote would not turn the TV off and the reception varied with each station. I didn't have high expectations, but this was not worth $149 (even in NYC). I would pay more for just a little better upkeep, or paid $99 and been more understanding. Overall, the stay was not horrible, but I would not stay again."
253,1865,"Jun 6 2005	Very Nice for NYC	The King sized smoking room was kinda small, but thats to be expected in NYC. It was very clean and in a convenient area. All your major shopping is right there within walking distance or a short cab ride. This is the perfect place for a quick overnight stay in NYC if your not really staying in your hotel room much."
254,1865,"May 19 2005	Great experience!	My wife &amp; I just returned from a brief visit to NYC where we stayed @ the LQ-Manhattan. Both of us were impressed by the central location (5th Ave., Macys, Penn Station just minutes away), helpful staff, &amp; included extras (internet connection/printer, breakfast, gym). The room was 'typical' Midtown size (read:compact), but had everything we needed &amp; was tidy. I would recommend this inn without reservation.Note --&gt; the rooftop/terrace lounge was closed for maintenance,..."
255,1865,"May 19 2005	Ok - but showing lack of upkeep	I stayed here for four days in mid-May while on vacation.For some reason, the NY Times Guide to New York (2005) rates this place very highly, so I decided to try it. I've never been to NYC. They gave me a quiet, no-smoking room like I requested. On the 12th floor.The problems...A/C didn't work, it was on full cool but was actually heating the room. It was 77 degrees in the room when it was 62 outside. I called the front desk. They didn't send the engineer until I called again a couple hours later. He worked on it (drained rusty water out the window!). It worked for about 10 minutes and then it started to heat up again. It obviously needs some sort of overhaul.Of course, the windows are to be left closed! I called them again and again and they weren't really interested. Eventually they gave me a fan and opened a window. That worked pretty well as it cooled off in the city at night. For the rest of my stay I just left the window open. That may not be an option in the summer! The shower head had been taken apart. When I turned on the shower, water went everywhere. I put the shower head back together. Lots of hot water, great shower.The faucet in the sink doesn't drip, it leaks. If you get it just about half way between open and closed it might stop running (weird).The wireless internet did not work, the signal is too weak. As usual for a large city, I was picking up signals from wireless points in adjacent buildings, which evidently don't have free internet. The wireless doesn't work in the lobby either. The front desk has no clue, but you can't expect them to. So I used the &quot;business center&quot; in the basement.One thing I heard about this place - it stinks. Boy does it ever! The smell comes from the laundry room in the basement, next to the business center. It's that sour milk smell. With no A/C in the basement, it gets humid and then that smell is almost overpowering. The smell drifts up to the lobby, but isn't as strong. Importantly, the smell does not seem to make its way any further up the hotel. If you just come down to the lobby and leave you might never notice it. But if you need to do some work down at the business center, you might want to bring your own oxygen.The other thing I heard - the elevators. Yes, they are small and old and did break down, causing lines of people waiting to get up. But they fixed it quickly. The staff uses the elevators a lot, laundry baskets and equipment are often hogging them (where's the service elevators?). Watch the step when you get off! No problem with breakfast. They man keeps the place stocked while people swarm in and out. Just the basics. Good bagels. Juice machines spray your feet (stand back). They ought to fix that one toaster - if they would just put on a new handle people could use it. If you don't like the free breakfast, you can walk a half block out to 5th or Broadway and get whatever you want, including 3 or 4 fast food places. Lots of places to eat around there. The business center has some old and worn down PC's and &quot;chairs&quot;. The internet worked well. A couple times some foreign guests were there surfing porn sites - whatever. They have a nice laser printer. You'll love the keyboard where the space bar doesn't work (trying writing email). It's important to have access to the internet to get tickets and times to events in NY. I downloaded subway schedules and maps.The location is great. It's in &quot;Korea town&quot;, really &quot;Korea street&quot;. I arrived via train at Penn Station. I just walked the two blocks to the hotel. Madison Square Garden is next to Penn Station, so this might be a good place to stay if you want to take in an event there.Empire State Building is a block and a half. The subway station is at the end of the block at Broadway and 32nd. Several trains run through there. Including the R and W which will take you down to Battery Park/Wall St/WTC site. The W and N will take you to Queens and the bus to LaGuardia. MTA is doing construction on the subway, so you can sometimes not get back to the 34th St station on weekends. You can also pick up those double decker tour bus at the Empire State (for tourists).Overall I had a good vacation. The hotel issues didn't become big ones. What bothers me is that La Quinta doesn't seem at all interested in keeping the place up. A lot of broken little stuff which indicates a lack of interest.NY isn't cheap, but that doesn't mean that can just let the place fall apart and charge less.Compared to other places in NY, it's cheaper and the location is good. But it might be worth spending the extra $ or so a night to get a place that's kept up. Because if you have some problems, they probably won't fix them.I would probably stay somewhere else next time I visit NY."
256,1865,"May 19 2005	Great choice!	La Quinta Inn was a great choice to stay in NY. In general, hotels in NY are expensive and below the European quality standards (unless you are willing to pay a fortune). Considering this, La Quinta Inn was clean, with friendly staff, the price includes breakfast and quite well located. It was a great choice and I had a great time in NY."

We filled up on the breakfast and didnt need to eat again till dinner so it saved us money there as well. I would definitely definitely stay here again. thums up!!"
258,1865,"May 18 2005	Great Value at an Excellent Location	I recently stayed at the LaQuinta Manhattan based on the reviews at this site and I must say the good comments were on the mark. My room, which was a non-smoking Queen for $99 a night, was clean and spacious. The bathroom was well equipped with a dryer, phone, generous amounts of toiletries, and plenty of hot water for the shower. Best of all, the bed was amazingly comfortable. I didn't have the best view, as my room overlooked the back of another building, but if I looked upward I could easily see the Empire State Building. Then again, I don't come to NYC to lounge in a hotel room so it was no big deal. Excellent location, with Penn Station, the subway, Macy's and the Empire State Building literally a couple of minutes away.For as much as I was pleased with the hotel, I can only give them 4 stars because of the following: I had the air conditioning on at full blast but the room never felt cooler than 75 degrees; and the front desk staff could have been less rushed, though I must give a good word for the bell staff who were helpful and always had smiles. I highly recommend the La Quinta Manhattan and will stay there again."
259,1865,May 13 2005 	Great value!	I stayed at the La Quinta and was quite impressed with the hotel. I didn't expect to have breakfast included in the rate I paid and also free Wireless Internet throughout the hotel. The free wireless really was fantastic as that was just what I needed as I was in nyc for business- so many larger hotels don't seem to have it. The staff were polite and the room was clean and comfortable. I was very pleasantly surprised and impressed with the hotel's amenities! I shall definitely be back here next time I am in nyc!
260,1865,"May 11 2005	Good value for money	We stayed for five nights in April, this was not our first choice because we booked quite late, and could only have a queen room but this was adequate. We asked for a quiet room, so were at the rear of the hotel and it was quite dark but had a view of the Empire State Building, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast good -I liked the bagels, and there was internet access in basement and a gym. The location is very convenient, many places in walking distance and we found the staff helpful. This hotel was very good for the money, although we paid $125 plus more at the weekend, perhaps due to late booking."
261,1865,"May 10 2005	Satisfactory Clean but Marginal Residual feelings	After a number of trips to NYC, I view this hotel as functional and very clean, but with fairly BLAH, mostly due to disinterested or crabby front desk staff. Phone assistance was good, with prompt followup calls when hot water was slow to come. The maid (Gangha) was lovely, the room immaculate, and the breakfast was nice (the breakfast man was friendly too). There is a tiny basement gym.First Impressions being what they are....STAFF DEMEANOR means so much to me, that I view most hotels through that particular looking glass. Plus, I travel alone. Who wants a meany at the front desk?Having asthma, I asked for a Non-Smoking room, but on arrival had to strongly stress that all over again to an eye-rolling, blase' Melinda, who said &quot;I don't understand what it is you want.&quot; Duhhhhh---however, to the Hotel's credit, they quickly came up with a room even though I was first told the hotel was full. Actually, my 7th floor hallway was nice and quiet and I did not see anything that looked like a FULL hotel. There was no view, but I kept the curtains drawn and watched the excellent TV with extras--and slept well. I felt secure there.When making arrangements, I asked for an e-mail verification of my non-smoking room reservation and employee SUNIT told me &quot;We don't DO e-mail,&quot; hence it arrived via mail while I was in NYC. I think this member of the CORE hotel chain is acceptable, but not a winner I'd seek out again. The location is seedy due to ugly area and garbage and such (in the Korean district). But good things are within easy reach---Times Square, etc. Interestingly, another hotel in the chain (RedRoof) is across the street. I paid $139/nite for 3 nites, $179.00 the 4th.I think the location and value is no more than the $139/nite MAX.I prefer the Milford and its area above this site--even though the Milford rooms are tiny."
262,1865,"May 6 2005	Great Value in Midtown Manhatten	My husband and I celebrated our 20 year anniversary in NYC this year and stayed at this hotel. It is a great location, Macys half a block, 5th Ave half a block, everything very close. Nice sized room, clean, great spread in the morning in the lobby, muffins, coffee, croissants, cereal, fruit, etc... Will definately stay again! We got our room with a king bed for $100 per night!"
263,1865,"May 2 2005	Great location.	My friend and I stayed 7 nights, and were very pleased with the hotel. We had a large corner bedroom, good beds, plenty of hot water (some reviewers have complained about that) very clean and breakfast OK. The staff were efficient if a little impersonal, but we thought the hotel great value for that location. Would stay there again."
264,1865,Apr 29 2005	Follow up from Oct 18th 2004 review	I did complain to La Quinta HQ in regards to the poor service that I experienced in Oct 2004 upon check out. Good follow up from HQ customer relations. I hope that the service level is heading in the right direction.
