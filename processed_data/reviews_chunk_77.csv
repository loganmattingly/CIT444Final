265,1865,"Apr 2 2005	Great Value	We researched alot before making reservations and found reviews here to be mixed, but decided to try the La Quinta. We will go back again! Arriving at 10:30 am well before checkin time, there was no problems getting our bags held for us so we could get going places. For just over $100, the location can't be beaten. Everything was great. Our room on the fourth floor above the main entrance was not noisy. The staff all seemed polite and helpful. The bar on the rooftop was rather quiet, but the Empire State Building is right there to gaze at over a nightcap. Our room was clean and average size for Manhattan. Bathroom was great with plenty of hot water. The WiFi and cable TV worked fine and both elevators worked fine. The free continental breakfast was good. There is a good subway station with in one block and Penn Station with all the main lines and Madison Square Garden are just 3 blocks away! Macy's and the Empire State Building are just over a block away too! We will recommend this hotel to anyone in the hundred dollar price range and will stay there again."
266,1865,"Mar 25 2005	La Quinta A Good Bet	From the reviews on this site, my boyfriend and I were braced for a ramshackle room and rude staff, but we were prepared to take a chance because we got a good rate. Maybe we were lucky, but I wish I had known what I know now: this place is perfectly fine -- a good bet. We had a corner room with a king-size bed on the twelfth floor, and it was clean and reasonably comfy. The bathroom appeared to be brand-new, and the shower was nice and hot. The staff were perfunctory when we checked in, but friendly and fast when we called down to request things. I'm extremely picky, and I'd say this is a solid budget hotel that you can pick without any worries."
267,1865,"Mar 23 2005	LaQuinta Hotel Great Hotel for the Price	Stayed at the LaQuinta Hotel on 32nd &amp; Broadway. Was quite pleased with the Hotel. We had rooms 510 &amp; 511, 4 in one room and 3 in the other. Room 511 was a corner room and was even larger than Rm. 510. Both rooms were quite large and very clean. Sheets were changed daily (we marked them so we would know). We paid $99.00 for the 1st night and $109.00 for the second. WE book these rooms about 4-5 weeks prior to our trip by calling the Applecore Hotel directly. When we originally booked them, the price was $149.99 for each night. I checked the website daily. At one point the prices came down to $119.00 / night. I quickly called the hotel and asked for that price. A week before the trip I again checked the website and saw the room was down to $99.00 for the 1 day of our visit &amp; 109.00 for the second. Again I called and asked for the lower rate. The staff was pleasant and very willing to give us the lower rate. So .... continue to check the price even after the room is reserved! Did breakfast at the hotel. Was very nice to have that to start our day, &amp; it saved $$$$ not having to buy breakfast for everyone. Consisted of bagels, donuts, toast, fruit, several kinds of cereal, &amp; of course coffee &amp; juices. Since we got up early, we never had a problem with crowds in the breakfast area and we never had to wait for an elevator. We had no view from our window ( just the wall of another building). However, be sure to visit the bar on the top floor to see the beautiful view of the Empire State building.This was a great hotel and I would definitely stay there again. Even tho many on this website do not like the Penn Station area, we found it to be close to everything and very good."
268,1865,"Mar 21 2005	Great Place to Stay	Just returned from a 4-day stay and I must tell you, we had a very good experience. I was a little hesitant because of the elevator problems in the past, but we didn't have a problem in the least. The location couldn't have been better. Close to subway transportation and PENN Station. Not a bad walk to Time Square and very close to the Empire State Building. For the money, this IS your best buy. I recomend this place and hope to return in the near future.VickiOrange, TX"
269,1865,"Mar 15 2005	fab hotel	we stayed at the la quinta for a week and its a fab hotel,clean comfortable,big rooms,own bathroom and a good breakfast,great location,any problems fixed straight away,what more could you ask for!great rates too!"
270,1865,"Mar 14 2005	Great Place	This place was great!!! You cant beat the price or the location. The rooms were small but very clean. For the amount of time you spent in the room it really doesnt matter how big it is. The hallways smelled kind of funky, but remember your in the middle of NYC, not the cleanest place in the world. And besides, how much time do you spend in the hallway? I would deff. stay at this place again."
271,1865,"Mar 14 2005 	Don't waste your money	We registered for this hotel specifically because of its wifi claim. We are two graduate students who wanted to focus on work and use the Internet to do research. We called ahead and got a guaranteed room and were assured the wifi worked. When we arrived we were told the wifi hadn't worked for over two days. Additionally, we could not get our money back. we also had no where else to go as it was late at night. The hotel smelled really bad, as though there were dead animals in the walls. The hallways and lobby smelled the worst. The people at the front desk made no apologies for the lack of wifi service, nor for the fact that the reservations clerk did not tell us the truth. The room was incredibly tiny. The continental breakfast was the usual stale bagels and dry cereal. But in addition, the coffee was admittedly the worst, worst hotel coffee I have ever had. Do not spend your money on this hotel. There are plenty of other terrific deals in New York City."
272,1865,"Mar 13 2005	Great Location	Hi My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel from March 4-9, 2005. We received a great rate and also got discounted when using our AAA card. The hotel is in a perfect location. Walking distance to times sqaure, fifth avenue, central park and other attractions. There is also a subway on the corner if you wanted go to other areas.The hotel does offer a free continental breakfast consisting of donuts, bagels, toast, orange juice, apple juice, instant oatmeal and fruit.The rooms were very small, but clean. Sometimes there wasn't any hot water so we had to take cold showers. This only happened twice out of our five nights. If you require basic amenties at a reasonable price, this is the hotel for you!!"
273,1865,"Feb 17 2005 	Loved it!	We first checked into (and left!)another hotel around the corner and were afraid of what we would find here. I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was in a great location and looked nice inside. Clean, nice room...great price. It was small, but it IS NY.The hallway smelled badly like fish-but I didnt spend much time in the hallway. The front desk staff was so nice and apologetic that the first hotel was so bad. They called us a great car servicee in the morning at a discount rate so we could ride to the airport in style. I will DEFINITELY stay here again!"
274,1865,"Feb 16 2005	What do you expect?	This is a centrally located hotel in Manhattan. It costs $99 a night. You could be forgiven for expecting a slum for this price. What you get is a clean, good sized hotel, with friendy staff (especially the concierge) and a free breakfast.So it smells a bit like an old persons home, you have to queue some days for breakfast (you are getting it for free), the lifts can be a bit slow if you are above the 4th floor. Like I said ealier this is a $99 centrally located Manhattan hotel. If you can't put up with these small inconveniences, pay more for a &quot;better&quot; hotel. But be warned having stayed in &quot;better&quot; hotels, you may be disappointed when you find more inconveniences there!Overall this is an excellent hotel for the money. If you are an uptight kind of person, you may not appreciate this hotel. If you are relatively relaxed about travelling and see your hotel as a base from which to explore, choose this hotel, you won't be disappointed"
275,1865,"Feb 16 2005	Crackin' little hotel!	We have just returned from a 6 night stay in this hotel. The location is FABULOUS! Just one block from Macy*s, Empire State Building etc and there is a subway station at the end of the street (2 mins walk). Times square is about 5-10 mins walk. The hotel is surrounded by places to eat- a fab deli at the end of the road, a Burger King, CVS pharmacy, Pizza Petes (v friendly), Wendys etc. The road itself is the chinese/thai area so if you like this type of food there are lots of restaurants to choose from. Opposite and upstairs is an internet cafe (pink sign, I think) which was $3 for a half hour.The rooms are clean with everything you need.. they were cleaned daily with fresh towels. It was a smallish room but you just sleep there! The bed was comfy and the TV massive. There was a desk, side tables, long mirror, wardrobe with iron &amp; ironing board, TV unit, bathroom with shower and bath, soap, shampoo, shower gel and hairdryer...as I said everything you need! You can get interactive movies and games for when you are really tired and can't be bothered going out. The breakfast is fab &amp; free- cereal, hot &amp; cold drinks (English Tea!), bread, bagels, toaster and donuts. Also a microwave and fresh fruit. Free newspapers in here too.There was always plenty to choose from although go before 9am as between 9am &amp; 10am it was packed full. Also front desk provides free security deposit boxes.A few minor issues...they never have enough money to change travellers cheques but there is a place just up the street who charge $5.50 per $100 or Macy*s will change them free (Floor 1 1/2 by the cafe). We had an issue with our loo which didnt flush properly and we reported it at the desk &amp; via the complaints card but it did not get resolved- not a major issue.All in all, a great little hotel. We would stay again as everything is within walking distance which is what you need for a short stay. Would recommend it to anyone."
276,1865,"Jan 29 2005	I recommend this hotel!	Why do I give it an above average rate? People! Be realistic. For $99/night in New York City you can NOT go there expecting a lot. My husband and I didn't and were pleasantly surprised when we found a friendly staff, clean room, size was ok (how much time do you spend in your room when you are visiting NY?) The breakfast was good, had bagels, toast bread, muffins, donuts, cereal, bananas, coffee, tea, cappuccino, orange/apple juice...and clean. Yes, the TV didn't work great (we could've asked for that to be fixed, but didn't bother because there were just a few channels that didn't work right). The neighborhood is good and safe, close to the subway, Empire State building, a good central location. There was free internet access in the basement. We didn't use it, but that's a good service.All in all, for that price we were satisfied, would definitely go there again, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family."
277,1865,"Jan 20 2005	Great Value 	We stayed here from 11th January to 18th January 2005 the accomadation was great value for money, rooms were clean and well sized. We had 2 queen beds loads of space the location was perfect this was our 3rd visit to ny and i would stay there again. THUMBS UP !!!"
278,1865,"Jan 19 2005	It Stinks! (Literally)	My parents, my wife and I all stayed at the La Quinta Manhattan just after Christmas of 2004, and I'm sorry to say it was a disaster from the moment we checked in. When we arrived, the parking valet told my parents that their RV had too high a clearance for the hotel parking garage, even though my mother had specifically told the reservations agent that they had an oversized vehicle at the time she booked the reservation, and even though the agent had assured them that this would not be a problem. We ended up having to park in a commercial lot several blocks away, at our own expense. The hotel did not reimburse us for the difference between their standard parking charge and what we had to pay to park outside.Once we checked in, we noticed almost immediately that the hotel stank -- literally. The stairways, which we had no choice but to use frequently because of the slow elevators, reeked of garbage and rotten eggs. The hallways on the guest floors had an ever-present odor of mildew, probably because the maids tended to leave carts filled with dirty linens and sheets out in the halls all day and night. And every morning, the guest rooms smelled of the food being cooked for breakfast in the lobby, which at that hour was so crowded that you had to wait in line for about 45 minutes just for a bagel and coffee.The rooms themselves were average-sized for a discount hotel in Manhattan, which is to say, quite small though not impossibly so. The cable TV mostly worked, once you got used to all the complicated steps amd menus you had to go through just to turn it on. The TV-Internet connection was absolutely worthless, and the hotel staff had no idea about how to operate or fix it. The shower water fluctuated between too hot and too cold for the first five minutes, then turned ice-cold and stayed that way. If two people share a room and take their morning showers back-to-back, the second one can forget about having any warm water at all.The maid service was the worst I've ever encountered in New York. On our second day, the maid did not come to service the room until 4:00 pm, even though we had posted the &quot;Maid Service Requested&quot; sign on the door before we went out early that morning. When the maid finally arrived, my wife and I had returned from a day of sightseeing and were attempting to take quick catnap before going out to dinner. When we asked her to come back after 5:00, she brusquely told us that her shift was over at 5:00, and that if we wanted the room cleaned at all, it had to be right that instant. I had to complain to the hotel manager to get them to send a maid after 5:00, and even then, it was done grudgingly. Even my wife, who always makes it a point to tip hotel maids generously, had no problem with not leaving one in this instance.On the plus side, the hotel is centrally located, just a few blocks from the Empire State Building, Herald Square, and Penn Station. The neighborhood is decent, and the price was inexpensive by Manhattan standards. There are a fair number of restaurants nearby, though most of the really good ones are either uptown or below 14th Street. But none of this made up for the poor service, the snails-paced elevators, and the atrocious smells pervading the hallways and stairways above the lobby.In spite of all of this, I have nothing against the La Quinta chain. Two years ago, my wife and I stayed at a La Quinta in New Orleans -- a city where decent and reasonably priced hotels are almost as hard to find as they are in Manhattan -- and found that one to be excellent. I got the impression that La Quinta bought its NYC hotel recently, and is making an effort to bring it up to their standards. But judging from our experience, they have a long, long way to go to make this happen, and I will not be staying at or recommending this particular hotel any time soon."
279,1865,"Jan 13 2005	the only hotel to stay in new york	I found this hotel to be lovely. It has an excellent location, just up the street from Macys and 5 min walk from Times Square. Staff were really nice not like were described in other reviews. Really nice guy there if you need a favour called &quot;persaud&quot;, he's very helpful. The lifts were all working and really fast again not like othere reviews that I've read. They seem to have been new ones so maybe they have been changed. Rooms and bathroom are just a tad on the small side but nothing to complain about. You have quite enough room even with 3 people staying in the room with 2 queen beds and luggage! If you are not used to street noise do ask for a room at the back because new york streets are noisy. I'm actually a travel agent and would have no problem in selling this hotel. It's the most reasonable in the city especially for the quality. I have stayed in several 4 star hotels in london and I would consider this hotel a better standard. In my opinon, it's the only place to stay and anyone I spoke to that were staying in the hotel said the same."
280,1865,"Jan 2 2005	Not Bad For The Money	I have to admit for the money we was shocked at how clean this hotel was. It looks like it was recently remodeled. The room was a little small and the tv cut out a couple times, but both elevators worked but they are slow. Parking was only 24 bucks for 40 hours which I thought was reasonable. all in all we give it 2 thumbs up."
281,1865,"Jan 1 2005	not great	Rooms are small, larger rooms smell of Korean food from neighborhood. Heat working ok, but has to be regulated often as it gets too hot. Staff not very helpful. Breakfast is good, but during busy time, not enough tables and chairs. We wouldn't stay here again, unless nothing else was available."
282,1865,"Dec 29 2004	Good for an affordable midtown hotel but don't expect great service	We stayed here in mid December. I travel to NYC every few months on a limited expense account, so I'm always looking for an affordable place. La Quinta had rooms available when the rest of Manhattan seemed booked up due to the holiday season, and the price was good by comparison to other options. Our room was fine; clean, good condition, with OK wifi access; certainly the room was better than other more expensive hotels I've stayed at in NYC. Wifi is definitely &quot;iffy&quot; though so if you must have reliable wifi, try another hotel. Staff were OK but don't expect great service. When we arrived, they had no record of our reservation. My impression is that this isn't a place where a customer can be successful with the staff if the customer gets on their high horse and complains and is demanding; my sense is that the staff would be too happy to tell you to shove it. In our case, we were very polite and smiling and patient, and after about 30 minutes the staff had successfully re-created our reservation at our original rate. Overall I'd stay here again if I could get a great rate, but if something goes wrong, you don't have much leverage with the staff to get anything fixed."
283,1865,"Dec 22 2004	Great Hotel Great Value	My girlfriend and I had a great experience here. We just stayed here last weekend (the weekend before Christmas) and the staff was very helpful and the room was better than expected. I recomend getting a king room, because I've heard the queen rooms are small. It was clean, quiet and the location was incredible. I avoided the breakfast in the morning because it was packed with people and took forever just to get to the coffee maker. Other than that it was quite enjoyable. And the discounted rate on parking was fantastic. I would definately stay here again. And for a rate of 136.00 (with AAA) for the friday and saturday before christmas, you can't beat it!"
284,1865,"Dec 19 2004	Extremely rude and incompetent staff	I have never stayed at this hotel, and I would never stay there. I was trying to call a guest staying there, and I got transferred to the room. Since no one answered, I decided to call again in five minutes, and then the reception told me the guest had checked out a long time ago. I asked them why they hadn't told me so before and she said &quot;we just didn't&quot;. After I complained about this inconsistency in answers, she simply said &quot;OK&quot;. No apologies or anything. If this is exemplary of the service provided in the hotel, I can not recommend this hotel."
285,1865,"Nov 19 2004	La Quinta was all right!	We stayed at the La Quinta from Nov 11-14 and found the accomodations to be very satisfactory. We reserved a King bed, non-smoking room and that is what we got. It was clean, pleasant and comfortable. Both elevators are now working, but during check-in and check-out times they can be a little slow. We found the front desk staff and bellman to be very courteous and accomodating. We arrived at 9am on the 11th and they stored our luggage for us until check in time, and arranged for late check-out for us.We booked our room directly on the La Quinta reservation website and had no problems with our accomodations. I overheard two other people at check in complaining that they had booked through a discounter website, and they did not get the accomodation that the discounter had guaranteed. Buyer beware.We would definitely stay here again, the price was reasonable and the location was good."
286,1865,"Oct 25 2004	Truly Awful	My husband and I stayed at La Quinta Manhattan when we returned to NYC for a wedding, having lived in NYC previously for several years. We were used to the prices and small spaces, but nothing prepared us for the horror of this stay. The room we were given was absolutely tiny, with almost too little space for 2 people to be standing up at the same time. (Bed was almost up against the walls on both sides, barely enough room to wiggle sideways into the bathroom. TV set was propped on dresser almost directly at foot of the bed.) The room reeked, and I mean stank, sickeningly and unbelievably of cigarette smoke, as if the room had been an unventilated smoking lounge for the last 50 years (we had asked for a non-smoking room). But get this: the bathroom, which smelled even worse (if that were possible) had a swinging door, with no lock and not even a door handle. In fact, there was no latch of any kind. That's right folks. It was a &quot;swinging door&quot; such as you would find between the kitchen and dining room in a restaurant. This door was right at the head of the right side of the bed, and the toilet was just inside the door. No privacy in there folks, because the person sitting on the toilet behind this door (that did not even entirely fill out the doorjamb) was about 6 inches from the bed, which was the only place where anyone else in the room could be. Try doing your business under those conditions. Lovely. I immediately complained to the front desk, and I was given the room key to another room to look at. Believe it or not, the 2nd room (although slightly bigger) was so indescribably horrible (smelled like a dead body was rotting under the bed) that we promptly went back to the original room. Had there been another room in the city available, we would have left, but there was nowhere to go. I have heard that some rooms at La Quinta are larger than what we stayed in, but we had asked for a non-smoking with a queen size bed, and what we got was revolting, tiny, dirty and miserably hot. Worse, I discovered when I got home that all my stuff smelled like that smoky room and I have had to throw out a garment bag and a cosmetics bag which after repeated cleaning, will not give up that smell. I may also have to throw out my brand new suitcase. So, whatever your options, do yourself a favor and stay away from this place."
287,1865,"Oct 10 2004	broken and smoke	As I arrived at the LaQuinta on my first trip to New York I already had a bad taste in my mouth because when I had called to confirm the reservations I had been told that I would need to pay a different amount for the hotel than I had originally been quoted. Granted, the hotel was a nice building, but the staff was not helpful at all. Also, the famous elevator that I have read about that has been broken is still broken. During my stay the one working elevator only worked approximately twice during my stay of four nights. Also, because I am allergic to smoke I had made certain that I had a non-smoking room and it was a smoking room when I checked in...when I spoke to the staff they were not helpful in switching rooms for me. Yes, the LaQuinta was priced well, but I would definately pick again if I was doing my trip over. As I walked around New York I saw many more hotels that were priced at the same level that I wished I had stayed at. Beware of the LaQuinta unless you want to tolerate broken elevators, rude staff, and a smoky room!"
288,1865,"Sep 21 2004	Great location good price	My fiance and I stayed at the La Quinta Manhattan for two nights (9/16 - 9/17) and we both found it very clean and comfortable. Yes, the elevators are a problem - only one is working and it's very slow. However, we were on the 6th floor and we always used the stairs going down so we were able to avoid using it at least half of the time. The breakfast is really great and we found the little guy working in the shop down in the lobby very helpful. The hotel is very close to the Empire State Building - in fact, you get a great view of it from the rooftop bar! Our room was small but still comfortable for the two of us and very clean. Overall, we had a very good experience and I would say that for the money, it was more than we expected."
289,1865,"Sep 18 2004	Comfortable and Clean	My Mom and I stayed at La Quinta for 5 nights in September and we only paid $676 for a double room! For this we received excellent customer service, clean comfortable rooms, and an excellent location! Okay fair enough there was still only one elevator working but we never had to wait that long. I would definitely be staying at this hotel again!"
290,1865,"Sep 13 2004 	Great value	Stayed here for a 4 night stay. I selected this hotel because the rates were at least $50 less than any other property in the area (except those with &quot;shared baths&quot;). Paying sub-$100 for midweek in midtown, I was unsure what to expect.But everything was fine. The room was clean and well-serviced. The room size was not huge but not bad, especially for Manhattan: I had a King bed and plenty of room to walk around the room, even with my bags out.There were 2 elevators, but one was under maintenance. That made the waits a bit long but not too terrible.I cannot comment on the service here, since I had no problems that required attention.Typical (free) continental breakfast spread: bagels, cereal, etc.Note that the free wireless is extremely weak, to be expected, I guess, in a 100 year old stone building. I could not get any signal at all, either in my corner room or in the lobby. I was able to get a weak signal from the stairs on my floor, but who wants to work there. However, the phones have data ports and local calls are free.Summary - not the best hotel I've ever stayed at, but a great deal for the price. I would return here anytime cost is a consideration."
291,1865,Sep 8 2004	Garbage Dump	Terrible Service... Do not stay here.
292,1865,"Sep 3 2004	Terrible service!	This hotel does not understand the meaning of service. When calling to leave a message for a colleague who was (unfortunate enough to be) staying there, I was told &quot;our computers are down, please call back in 15 minutes&quot;. I asked if I could leave a manual message, and the desk man said &quot;Actually, it's pretty hectic here; you'd have a better chance if you call back in 10-15 minutes.&quot; I agreed to call back. When I called back, I was told the computers were down for at least an hour and I should call back then. I explained that this was an important message and could someone please write it down; my colleague would check the front desk. I was told this was simply not possible. I spoke with the manager who said &quot;we can't take manual messages&quot;, and that I could &quot;fax a message&quot;. (I have no idea why they could handle the paper from a fax, but not one from their own hand.)When I expressed my frustration and suggested that this would be bad publicity, the manager said &quot;all publicity is good publicity&quot;. Well, to those of you who are considering La Quinta - you know what you are getting into. Just don't expect to receive any messages.RM"
293,1865,"Aug 30 2004 	Try the Holiday Inn....	For a night or two, I guess it is ok. However, if you need to stay longer, forget it! First of all, the rooms are VERY small (think Paris hotels kind of small), and the air conditioning does not work. Secondly, the elevator is a HUGE problem... There is only one operational elevator out of two, and it is VERY small, and VERY slow, so you will be waiting quite some time for one that has room. In addition, the elevator does not have AC, so you will roast once you can get in one of them. Third, service is an issue... If you need something for your room, chances are that you will not get it because either they do not have it, or they do not have someone who can get it to you. One thing that would be funny if it had not actually happened was two mornings ago I had my &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign out on my door when I was awakened by a phone call from the desk... They said, that they had seen the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign, but were wondering when they could send someone up to clean my room! I am not sure what part of &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; they had trouble understanding... Anyway, I still have a week to go here, but if I had it to do over, I would not have.... Good luck."
294,1865,"Aug 29 2004	OK-good location	Rooms are small, but clean. Prices are reasonable and it is near the subway. Elevator is small and slow. A reasonable choice for the budget minded."
295,1865,"Aug 29 2004	Awesome Location. Nice rooms!	I just visited NYC this past weekend with family. I had booked the La Quinta simply based on the fact that it was located right downtown and it was the cheapest option available. To be honest, I went in expecting broken bathroom toilets and rude staff. To my extreme surprise (and that of my family) the hotel turned out to be the perfect traveller hotel. Free complimentary breakfast (nice) + clean rooms and the best of all LOCATION. Just a block from the Empire State building and only a stone's throw away from Times Square, Madison Square Garden, Penn Station. They also have a fitness center + a business center so pretty much an all in one package.I definitely recommend it ...I know I was apprehensive when I made my reservation, but hopefully this review will help others make their decision.Cheers~!"
296,1865,"Aug 24 2004	Good for the price!	Booked this for 2 nights, one night with a LaQuinta return certificate and the second night for $89.00 by calling the LQ Returns customer service number. The hotel was clean, we requested a large double room for our family of four and it was very roomy. We had stayed the week before at The Belvedere in the Theatre district for 169.00, our family preferred The Belvedere--better location and nicer facility.

297,1865,"Aug 10 2004	Smallest room imaginable but OKAY Hotel	My wife and I stayed at this hotel July 29th through August 2nd. I selected this hotel based on price and the reviews on this website. This sight was most helpful. Check in was smooth for us, but I immediately noticed another couple switching rooms. Definately a bad sign. The stories about the elevator were true, although the broken one was being worked on. I think they had people pretending to work on it to make the guests feel like something was being done about the problem. I can't imagine it takes months to fix it. Be prewarned, we had issues with the working elevator as well. Room #502We checked into room #502 and couldn't open the door all the way. This was a Queen room, but the bed blocked the door and a small desk hutch area. You have to crawl over the bed to get to the other side because the dresser with the TV hanging over the edge blocks the way. This room was soo small it was funny. My wife couldn't believe it. The bathroom was barely large enough for one person. It was so small it had a shower stall and no tub because the length of the tub would be too long. The bathroom was the size of half a tub. Although the room was small, it was clean and looked like it had been remodeled in the past few years. There were no rats or insects or anything to fear. Rats were a big worry for my wife. As a side note, we later saw lots of them in the subways and Central Park. I guess they're like mosquitos in Texas. While getting settled in the room we noticed it was getting hotter. I walked down the stairs to report this to the front desk and also told them I was suprised by the small room. The lady said they would send someone up to look at the air conditioner and offered to change our rooms the next day. The air was fixed within five minutes and continued to work throughout the night.Room #804We moved to room #804 the next day and were much more comfortable. This was still a Queen room, but there was twice as much room. The bathroom was large enough for two with a full mirror, and lots of counter space. Instead of looking at moldy buildings and grime, we had a slightly better view of the Empire State Building. This room was clean just like the other room. The maid service did a good job as well. They also offer free wi-fi access, which was good because I needed to research activities and look up online subway maps etc. We spent a total of $529 for four nights, which was much cheaper than other hotels during that week. We did book less than two weeks before going, so better deals may have existed earlier. The location was excellent. We could walk or take the subway anywhere. Bryant Park is short walk. Macy's and lots of shopping are even closer. The Empire State Building is even closer. We walked to Times Square once, but found the subway quicker. A cab ride from the hotel to Times Square was about $5. Cab fare from La Guardia to hotel was $35 including tip and $25 to La Guardia from the hotel including tip. Different routes, but we didn't know we were being screwed the first time. Traffic wasn't responsible for the difference. Check your maps ahead of time and help the driver if you need to. Overall: We would stay here again for the convenience and price. Do not check into any room that ends in -02. Good Luck!"
298,1865,"Jul 25 2004	We would go back again	We would return again and hope by then the few problems we encountered would be fixed. We would have given it a higher review if both elavators had been working. We found the phones in our room did not work and although we reported it several times they did not get fixed, but we had cell phones. The breakfast they offered was good. Things were fresh and well stocked. We found the staff to be friendly."
299,1865,"Jul 16 2004	Skip this one	This place is terrible. The staff is rude. Things don't work. You can expect a semi-clean room and that's about it. The breakfast here is very limited. Don't plan on making a meal of it. Also, if your room (which will be TINY) encounters any problems such as TV or plumbing difficulty, expect to have to make several calls downstairs to the rude staff until something gets done. I have stayed at other La QUintas before and I will tell you that if you are expecting this hotel to measure up with other La Quintas throughout AMerica, you are only going to let yourself down. On a final note, the elevator (only one is working) is very slow. It is smarter to use the stairs, so request a lower floor."
300,1865,Jul 8 2004	OK for the price	We stayed 8 days at the La Quinta in mid-May. Rating would be higher if both elevators worked. we stayed on 7th floor and walked down most mornings. More than once it stopped and was full. so we just sort of gave up on the down elevator. At least on first floor you could tell where it was and when it might arrive. then decide whether to walk up. Good breakfast. Rooms clean. Good location. Good price
301,1865,"Jul 2 2004	Midtown Standard Budget Hotel	We stayed at the La Quinta Inn for 10 days in early-mid June 2004. We chose the midtown location as a good base to explore all Manhattan. The mid streets between 31 and 34 have good subway connections, although the area is crowded and busy.We had a Queen room, which was on the 14th floor. The room was a standard size for a budget hotel in New York. It was clean, the maid service was good, fresh towels, coffee, tea etc and the bed was comfortable and made each day. The shower was fine, iron, ironing board very handy, aircon worked well. The front desk always responded well to our requests. Nothing exceptional but nothing below a standard we would expect from a budget hotel. We had continental breakfast each morning, the dining area is on the ground floor about 8 cafe style tables. It was reasonable, fruit, cereal, toast, teas, fruit juice etc, no yogurt. Again we found this to be as we expected.The main problem was the lift as previous reviews mention as of mid June there was still only 1 working. It is a little inconvenient but it never took that long to arrive and given that it is a very old building and the lifts can only be repaired and not replaced we were grateful one was working at all. Bank machines next door and across the road, nice little Korean pastry shop and excellent Korean restaurants on the same street. Good location for subways uptown and downtown although some of the entrances close at night and it is about a 10 minute walk from Penn station which is the big station and always open.In closing, it is a budget hotel and reviews should fairly assess it in light of the price. We would stay at the hotel again if we got the same low rate including breakfast. If the rate was above say $120 plus tax (excluding July August) we would look elsewhere, but below $120 we felt it was a good deal."
302,1865,"Jun 9 2004	Don't do it	Extremely Rude Staff. Poor Service, we asked for extra blankets and towels twice and never recieved them. Tiny Rooms, Hot Water problems, and they upon leaving they tried to change the price of the room on us..What can I say..DO NOT stay at this so called hotel"
303,1865,"May 17 2004	Is this a hotel or brothel?!	We were cheated by yourstay and we had nor choice but to look for another hotel. To our despair most of the hotels in Manhattan were fully booked! Luckily we managed to get a room at La Quinta but the price was $249 per night?!! As we were desperate, we had to take the offer. To my suprise for the amount of money we paid, firstly the elevator was not working. And the words that came from the staff, &quot; I am not carrying your bags up the stairs, sorry&quot;. They were extremely rude! Then when we entered the room, we got a 150 square feet room with a not working AC! We didn't bother to complain because we can't really take the rudeness of the staff nomore. Luckily we only stayed that for a night. If La Quinta is a brothel, I would have expected these but it is a hotel. So please ignore this hotel if you are looking for a good and relaxig vacation."
304,1865,May 15 2004	5/8/04-5/14/04 Can't complain for a 2 and half stars hotel but	Lift is still out of order. Hotel won't run a/c in breakfast room like an oven. Be warn of gift shop if buying broadway tickets - got cheated on the price. Hv been told price for $80/- but was for $55/-.
305,1865,"Apr 28 2004	its alright	Location is alright. A good walk from Times Square but never really used taxis. Take comfortable shoes!! Room was a little tight but okay size (doubles). Restroom was good size. Hallway did stink though (I think they had just painted). Didn't really stay much in hotel room as you are too busy sightseeing. Quiet, no problems with outside noise."
306,1865,"Apr 27 2004	Fabulous for the price nice and clean!! Perfect location!	We just got back last weekend. We were looking for budget and found this wonderfully clean, centrally located hotel. And rumors about the front desk were untrue. We booked through Travelocity (not-recommended) and LaQuinta crew helped us sort out Travelocity's mistakes!! The stories about old carpet are true, but the bathrooms are completely marbled and redone, the rooms are clean. Small yes, great value yes!!! Walking distance to everything and the sky bar gets a fabulous view of the Empire State Building, you're in the building's shadow! The hot/cold water pressure was variable, take your shower before 9am!, Otherwise, we were shockingly surprised by the price, clenliness and location, we'd definitely stay there again!!!"
307,1865,"Apr 23 2004	Nightmare!!	Ok... while most of the reviews seem good of the hotel, you need to experience it first hand. The front desk staff is fine when you check in, but once you get past them its horrible. First of all, the elevators dont all work. One elevator for the entire hotel. You walk into the hallways, which by the way have a horrible smell to them. You get into your room.. theyre an OK size for a King Size bedroom. Turn on the air and nothing cold comes out. I call the front desk and they tell me the air is central in the hotel and its turned off because its &quot;going to be cold this weekend&quot;. Mind you, its not THAT cold and if im paying for a room i should be able to turn on the AC without a problem. Then they send someone else to come up and &quot;fix the air&quot;. The man says to leave it on LOW FAN and it should get colder in 15 minutes. Still NO COLD AIR AT ALL... all a lie... As my guests and I are still drenched in our sweat, I call the front desk staff again and begin to complain about the air and how hot it is in the room. If i wanted to spend the night in a sauna, I would have made a reservation at a gym. But anyways, they tell me that its &quot;New York law&quot; that they have AC's off during certain temperatures.. first ive ever heard of this since my AC was working at other hotels when it was snowing. EXCUSES.. EXCUSES.. EXCUSES. NEVER STAY HERE.. its the worst hotel. Youll be colder and more confortable sleeping with the homeless at Penn Station."
308,1865,"Apr 18 2004	A fantastic value place to stay	My family and I stayed at the La Quninta over the Easter break and had a fantasic time. The hotel is close to all the major attractions; benefits from helpful staff, decent-sized rooms, a great bar with a view and a fine continental breakfast. The hotel made our first trip to New York memorable..and hopefully it will not be our last!"
309,1865,"Apr 14 2004	Good Value Good Location -- I'll Be Back	April 8-13,2004 my daughter and I stayed at the LaQuinta Manhattan. I have been to NYC several times, and this hotel has the best bang for the buck. Although, it does have a couple of problems. There is only one working elevator for 14 floors, and it is VERY slow. Be sure to use the phone in your room before you come downstairs -- you don't want to have to wait on the elevator again, AND the gift shop and front desk won't share their phones. There is a great continental breakfast including bagels, cream cheese, jelly, toast, cereal, donuts, juice, coffee, milk, fresh fruit. Get up early enough to finish breakfast before 10:00 -- they close at 10:00 SHARP -- believe me, if you're eating at 10:00, you will be asked to leave so that they can clean up! The room was clean and comfortable (but the bed was a little too firm for me). Check-in and check-out was fast and courteous. Housekeeping did a great job. My room was on the 7th floor (715) facing 32nd Street. The noise from the garbage trucks woke me every night -- next time I'll ask for a room on the back side of the hotel. The property is located in Little Korea. No matter what time of the day or night, there were always people in the streets (although not super crowded). The street was well light, and I felt safe. The subway stop is half a block away...convenient to everything. If coming back to the hotel late at night, be sure that you don't miss your subway stop....the area south of the hotel (28th street) is kind of creepy at night."
310,1865,"Apr 2 2004	Nice Hotel Good Value Bad Front Desk Staff	I stayed at this hotel in March 2004 on a Saturday night. I got a very good rate for a Saturday night in NYC. The hotel was nicer then I expected. Check in was fast, but NOT friendly. One of the elevators was out of service (there are only two). Location is great for downtown. Close to Macys, Empire State Building. The room was surprisingly nice. It is small, but clean and nicely appointed. Bathrooms are clean with marble tops. I would recommend this hotel for someone looking for a good value to stay in NYC (they include continental breakfast). The only complaint was that the check in staff didnt really care much about the guest's needs."
311,1865,"Mar 21 2004	Fantastic location	This hotel is highly recommended to those on a budget yet hoping to be close to everything. Admittedly, check-in proved problematic when they wouldn't accept my card even though, before leaving for New York, I made sure there was plenty of money on it. I eventually had to pay cash for the room and simply recoup the cost through using my card for eating, shopping etc. The room was fine, the bed and bathroom were both clean so there was no complaint in that respect. The breakfast was good and proved to be a great way to start the day. However, I do suggest you arrive early to avoid the scrum that can gather after 8:30. The location is IMMENSE. Everything is close at hand and if you don't fancy walking, Penn Station is very near. If you are looking for good rates, a clean room and a supurb location, I recommend this hotel. Moreover, I dare say that this hotel is the best budget-type hotel in New York and I know that when I return to the city in December, i'll be staying at La Quinta"
312,1865,"Mar 21 2004	Great Hotel/Great Location/Great Price	I had read about this hotel in Budget Travel magazine, but it was much, much more than a budget hotel. The location was great--just around the corner from Macy's and down the street from the Empire State Building. The room was so quiet even though it faced 34th Street. The king size bed was firm and comfortable; the bathroom had a full-size tub and shower and although the room wasn't huge, there was plenty of room for me to do my floor exercises! The continental breakfast was included in our low AAA rate and had a wide variety of food--fresh fruit, pastries, cereal, etc. I have recommended this hotel to my friends and I would certainly stay there again."
313,1865,"Mar 19 2004	I'd definitely go back!	I stayed there on 3/11/04 and am glad I did. The staff was courteous and efficient. The room was a little small than your average hotel room, but it was comfortable enough for two people. Most importantly, both the room and bathroom were clean. I also enjoyed their rooftop bar (Sky Bar), which @ night has an amazing view of the Empire State Bldg. I'd definitely stay there on my next trip. Highly recommend La Quinta."
314,1865,Mar 11 2004	Bad Font Desk Staff	Good location and relatively clean rooms but the corridors smell. Non-professional front desk staff.
315,1865,"Feb 10 2004	Exactly what a budget hotel should be	Stayed at the LaQuinta from 01/30 through 02/01/04. The lobby is bright and clean, and a continental breakfast is served in the lobby (like every LaQuinta property). Rooms are average-sized for New York but clean and comfortable. Visit the rooftop bar for a GREAT view of the Empire State Building. It's a cute bar with a little deck that is good for a casual drink before dinner. The location is in the middle of Koreatown near the Empire State Building, Herald Square, Madion Square Garden, &amp; Penn Station. The neighborhood doesn't offer the best shopping or dining, but the subway stop is a 1/2 block from the hotel and can take you anywhere quickly. At $99 in New York, you can't beat it."
316,1865,"Feb 4 2004	Great for Hockey	Had a wonderful six days end of September in NYC, a visit which was enhanced by the La Qunita Inn, being close to the ESB and the home of the Rangers. Although the elevators were sometimes semi-functional, this did not prevent us from enjoying the premises. Would definitely consider a further stay at the hotel when we visit again."
317,1865,"Jan 26 2004	could be nice...	Fantastic price, great location, classy lobby and complimentary breakfast are whats nice about this place. BUT, the hallways smell like urine, the bathrooms are freezing, heaters not working and unprofessional front desk staff are downers. Try the other applecore hotels, they all offer the same price"
318,1865,"Jan 13 2004	Great Room Great Location	We stayed at the La Quinta Manhatten for 2 nights in early January 2004. Having stayed at La Quinta hotels in Texas, I expected quality and that's what we got. The location was fantastic--a block away from a subway line and within walking distance of all the sights of mid-town (especially if you like to walk as much as we do.) The king-size bed was so firm and comfy and we didn't feel cramped in the room at all. The free (and ample) continental breakfast was a pleasant surprise--much more than a stale Danish and coffee! Even though we had a room overlooking a busy street, the room was extremely quiet and we heard no traffic. The only time we heard anything outside of our room was when our neighbors ran the water in the bathroom. (Unfortunately, they were nightowls and woke us up with their 3 am showers, but I imagine they also got a rude awakening when we showered at 8 am!)"
319,1865,"Dec 6 2003	Great Loaction But Don't Expect Any Service	My wife and I were celebrating our first anniversary and had an overall great experience in New York City but the La Quinta was probably the worst part of the trip. The location was very convenient, providing easy access to the Empire State Building, Herald Square, Time Square and the rest of Midtown Manhattan. The lobby and furnishings were quite basic and tight. Our 7th floor room was extremely compact but that was expected - it is Manhattan. What was unacceptable was how unbearably hot the room became despite the air conditioner being on full blast. Full blast but no cold air. We complained and were told it was fixed. Even after the bellman came to fix it, it was like a sauna. We probably should've requested a different room or simply checked out after the first night but if you are told something was fixed, you expect it to be done. I would only recommend this hotel if you are on a tight budget, have very low expectations and don't care about the quality of where you stay."
320,1865,"Nov 3 2003	No frills but great deal for New York!	I have been to New York quite a few times and I think that La Quinta is probably one of the best deals in Manhattan! We got our room for $99/night. Believe me, it is no St. Regis or Four Seasons and the customer service is a bit lacking, but if you are looking for a clean place to sleep and a location that is close to everything, La Quinta Manhattan is great."
321,1865,"Oct 27 2003	Great Low-Priced Hotel	We stayed at the La Quinta Inn Manhatten 10/23 and 10/24. It was very nice. Room was quite large for NY standards, water pressure and temp was great. The hotel's location was also easy to find as it is in the same block at the Empire State Building. Made it easy to direct the cab drivers to your location!"
322,1865,"Oct 23 2003	A steal in NYC	My fiancee and I were happy with the location. It is right by Macys and Herald Square. It is around the block from the Empire State Bldg and the heart of &quot;Koreatown or Koreablock&quot; It has all the basics and we no trouble sleeping at night. Ask for upper floors and the continental breakfast is good for someone who likes a light meal. For the money, it was very inexpensive at less than $100 on a Fri/Sat stay."
323,1865,"Oct 5 2003	AB FAB!	Stayed here in August 2003. Met up with friends here and shared a quad room. It was plenty bi enough, clean and comfy, staff very friendly, absolutely fab location great resturants near by, shopping and a great Irish bar down the road. The best part of this hotel was the sky bar it is the terrace bar on the roof which is over looked by the Empire State Building so it was great to drink a bud and look up at the Empire State all lit up at night. As a tourist it was brilliant.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted a very reasonably priced hotel near the Empire states and Penn Station and likes a drink with a view!"
324,1865,"Sep 30 2003	Very impressed	We stayed at La Quinta, Manhattan from 9/26/03-9/28/03. Our room was very nice for NYC. We had hot water and a nice cool room. The A/C worked great! The staff was helpful. There was not a shuttle to the airport. The second day we where there the maid did not leave any clean towels for us. We could see the Empire State building outside our window which was very neat. There was a continenatl breakfast that was tasteful. The elevator did run slow once in while. Location was awesome! I will go back, I was very satisfied."

1,1868,"Would not recommend this hotel	We stayed with Loews hotel in November 2009 and booked a non-smoking twin room. On arrival we were given a smoking double room. When we pointed out the error we were told that the room type was not guaranteed and were given very little by way of apology. We were met with a similar response when the issue was raised again on check out. In addition to the poor service, the hotel looked very tired and was in need of refurbishment. The location is good but there are much better hotels in the area for a similar price."
2,1868,"Nov 15 2009 	Nice but needs a refurb	I stayed here twice this fall due to Loews First Benefits. Both times I stayed in a Suite. The suite was roomy with a queen size bed and little master bath and a sitting room with couch and powder room.The check in area is fancy enough. The staff was adequate (other than housekeeping issues which seems to be a product of recession and I'm find at other four and five star hotels..I guess this is where they cut back)Anyway, the rooms are old looking and need to be gutted. Bathroom shower clogged. Bathroom toilet running. Stains on carpets and couches. Not totally gross and it was clean but not worth the $500 plus rates this place gets. I've stayed at worse in NYC but I've also stayed in better, nicer looking rooms for less in NYC lately. A lot of the boutique hotels and many of the chains such as the New York Hilton and the Crown Plaza times square might not be as fancy but the rooms are cleaner and newer.Service was adequate. Love the heaters over the bell area outside so you don't freeze when waiting for a cab. Also, another note, I stay in hotels all of the time but the room service here may be the most expensive that I 've ever seen. Bring in food or walk around the corner to Lexington for a bite or you'll pay big.I'd stay here again as the location on the upper east side is great. The hotel was quiet and the bed comfy so sleeping was great. I'd only stay though if I could get a great rate as this fading property is no 4 or 5 star as it would like to be."
3,1868,"Nov 9 2009 	Shabby not up to either star rating or price point	The Loews Regency is an old school sort of property with a pleasant and cozy lobby and nicely preserved historical touches in the public spaces. I was there for a meeting and the AV services and banquet-style food service was good but not stellar: hot water for tea served in a coffee-contaminated urn, for instance, a rookie mistake that a hotel of this quality shouldn't make. My room was large (and even included a small kitchenette space that I didn't need) and the furnishings were reasonably nice. Bed comfortable although linens could be nicer. Comfy robe provided. Cleanliness okay but not stellar. Bathroom downright depressing and poorly maintained. Very loud ventilation system in the room (fortunately I sleep with ear plugs) and TV has relatively few channels. All in all just not good enough considering the star rating and price point."
4,1868,"Oct 29 2009 	Top notch business hotel in excellent location	I have stayed several times at the Regency and am consistently impressed. The location is excellent at the borders of midtown and Upper East Side. The relatively small size of the hotel means it has a more convivial feel than larger and more impersonal luxury hotels. The breakfast room is excellent, populated mostly by local power-brokers. The fitness centre is definitely superior to most other hotel fitness centres, and again is used mostly by locals (with a personal trainer).Rooms could be larger, but that is a common complaint in NYC."
5,1868,"Oct 14 2009 	Smooth and well-appointed hotel on the Upper East Side	Hotel is in the UES, so unless you're into upscale condos, doctors or the a couple of the Museums there's not a lot going on up here. The subway is not as prevalent around here as it is in midtown and downtown or the UWS, so you may be cabbing it more than you planned. I suggest you tip the doormen graciously as they're a font of good info and you'll never wait more than a few seconds for a cab or car.Service is top-notch, as with all Loews Hotels. The lobby is surprisingly small, but rooms are decently-sized for NYC and dead-quiet. Try to get a room facing Park Ave. instead of the school or church on either side. The restaurant downstairs lays claim to the original &quot;Power Breakfast&quot; and it's not uncommon to see movers and shakers there. But it is pricey, and there are some great, cheap diners within a couple blocks walk. The adjacent nightclub is nice if you want a mellow evening of jazz crooners/piano bar with your drink.Traveling here with your pet is not only easy, it's encouraged. The pet-menu is creative and funny."
6,1868,"Oct 14 2009 	fantastic hotel and location	we had a fabulous stay at this hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. We have to mention Abraham our concierge whom made the trip for us always attentive to our needs, always smiling and genuinely interested in our day. Abraham also recommended to us a great restaurante one of 'David Burke's fine restaurante's - specialising in contemporary american food. We would also recommend 'Nougatine Jean Georges for great french food.Overall we will definately be going back to New York an amazing City and we would be definately staying in the same hotel ."
7,1868,Oct 11 2009 	AWFUL - NOT recommended	Completely overpriced ! Hotel was overbooked when we arrived ! Receptionist was extremly unfriendly and no one apologised for the mistake. We got given a Smoking room whereas we specially requested a non smoking. The smell in the room was horrible !!! Room was dark and not that spacious ! Nothing like this would be expected for a $500/night hotel.
8,1868,"Oct 9 2009 	Regency mistreats pet dog 	looking to spend a few days in the city, with my 3 children and small dog- we searched the internet for the 4 star hotels that were pet friendly on the upper east side. According to their website and reservationist , the two bedroom suite i reserved would be waiting for the arrival of my little Maltese with a dog bed and bowls and all sorts of pet ammenities. They also took the names of my children because supposedly , upon arrival they would receive a personal welcome in the room. when we arrived there was nothing there but the room itself which was tired -with drabby furniture and no site of dog items or any kid sized robes or amenities. We spent the day walking all over the city with our dog and when we came back to the room - the beds were not turned down for the night. When we pulled down the bedspread in the master bedroom i was nauseated to see dried blood stains on the sheets! we also couldn't open 3 lamps in the living room because the lightbulbs were missing! I immediately called housekeeping to report the issue. 20 minutes later a man knocked on the door and handed meet 2 sheets- he didnt even make the bed! we were so exhausted that we all piled into the kids bedroom and decided to deal with the whole mess in the morning with the front desk. After 3 housekeeping managers all came to inspect the problems they all declared that it was an oversite on someone elses shift. How in the world do they not change the sheets and inspect a room when a new person checks in!!! Then all i kept thinking about was that they only offered me two clean sheets for the bed and not even fresh pillow cases and blankets! Who wants to sleep on the same bedding as the previous guests!!Two days later still no dog bed- we kind of gave up hope, but were not going to let the Hotel ruin our vacation. Wed. night we had tickets to a broadway show that was suppose to be the highlight of the trip. After spending the day with the dog and taking him for his last walk - we left him on his blanket with his toys, put the do not disturb sign and left to the theatre. (Just to note: we travel all over the world with our dog to the best hotels and this is a routine he is very use to and has never ever been a problem.) From 7:00- 7:30 i recieved atleast 6 phone calls on my cell, from a hotel manager named ROSA. She kept telling me that someone was complaining that my dog was barking and every time the manger went to the door he kept barking. I told her the only reason he would ever be barking is if someone was knocking or making noise at the door- and that if she would stop bothering him he would stop. I explained to her that the show was about to start and that if it would make things easier I would pay someone to pet sit my dog in the room and scratch his belly until i got back. She proceeded to tell me that oh no we don't have any one that would do that! imagine this is a hotel that advertises their pet friendliness!!! 30 minutes into the show ROSA leaves a message on my cell that she entered my room and &quot;captured&quot; my 9lb maltese and that he is in the office downstairs! Needless to say i was hysterical!!! we had to run out of the show which broke my children's hearts! when i ran back to the lobby of the hotel I ran to the front desk begging to see where my pet was abducted to? my dog must have recognized my voice as I heard his crying yelps -we ran behind the mangers desk and found my dog tied in KNOTTED BED SHEETS- tied to the foot of desk!!!( the dog friendly hotel didnt use his leash or even have one of their own!) He was panic stricken - in a state i have never seen in my life!!! My dog and children were petrified and aghast at how we were treated in a supposed dog and child friendly Hotel. we immediately packed our bags and moved into the Ritz carlton - a true dog friendly establishment!!!"
9,1868,"Oct 7 2009	Fab stay at Loews New york is a must. I can't wait to return i'm busy saving	Hi I stayed at the Loews Regency for four nights with my daughter. It was a great stay, lovely comfortable bed in a fab room, With everything and more expected. We were made very welcome and felt totaly safe. Good location for most of the sights. Could not ask for more. We did get a good deal through Thomas Cook and would probaly not been able to afford it other wise. Now I am hooked and want to return a.s.a.p.On our return we relised my daughter had left her watch in the room. This was reported by e-mail to the hotel as soon as we got back to the U.K and we were contacted by the security member of the hotel who imeadiatley returned in by post. A big thanks to The Loews Staff for that. Susan and Rachel"
10,1868,"Oct 2 2009 	Fantastic comfortable stay however check your bill on checkout!	My wife and I stayed in the Loews Regency for 5 nights for our anniversary. We went to New York and to do the usual sight seeing.I have seen some bad reviews for this hotel, and believe from my experience that they are completely unwarranted. I agree it was expensive (920 for 5 nights) but all hotels in NYC are, so decided I would push the boat out a bit for a nicer stay, and that is exactly what we got. Bear in mind that my wife and I are not rich, travel the world staying in 5 star hotels, or very fussy... but happy with a clean comfortable room.Check in was extremely quick and smooth, and staff were extremely helpful when we asked for directions, taxis or anything else that we requested. We stayed in the superior double room (cheapest on offer), and we thought the room was huge and very clean. The king size was bed was massive, and more comfortable than most beds that I have slept on in any hotel.The decor isn't new or contemporary but the room was clean, as was the spacious bathroom. All bathroom accessories were provided for such as shampoo, soap, body wash, and conditioner. A little dissappointing was the lack of free wifi in the room, but then I'm not on holiday to use the internet. Beside there is a very fast FREE wifi connection in the lobby. As a bit of a fitness freak, I was more than happy with the fitness facilities in the gym, which included a good selection of cardio equipment, as well as weights and gym mats.The walls in hotel are slightly too thin as you can hear noise from the corridors, but it isn't that bad. I thought the locaion was excellent, a couple of blocks from Central Park, a block away from the closest subway which goes straight to Times Square, Spring Street, Brooklyn Bridge. But to be honest you can pretty much walk everywhere from the hotel... approx 15mins to Times Sq. There are also loads of Cafes and restaurants in the area for good breakfasts or dinner.As for the bill... make sure you check it and get a copy when you leave. We never use the minibar at any hotel due to the extortionate prices. On checkout they tried to charge us for minibar usage, but could not tell us what it was we had drunk. When we said we did not use they minibar they assured us that the bill would be corrected. However on our return to England I found a charge of $7.04 on my card from the hotel, for drinking a can of coke from the minibar. It took four emails to the hotel to get the money back. As for NYC... it's a fantastic city for sightseeing, eating and shoppping. Subway is cheap and quick if you don't want to walk, but I wouldn't advise using it after 10pm. Have breakfast at Balthazar, and eat dinner at Public. Also if you want to get a good view... Rockerfeller is much better than the Empire State Building."
11,1868,"Oct 1 2009 	Service Professionalism Amenities Lacking @ Loews Regency	Service -Stayed for an extended weekend under two different reservations (booked the first two nights with a consolidator and the last night directly with Loews). Was told by reservation desk staff upon check-in that my party (my friend, his wife, and his young child plus my wife) would be &quot;automatically&quot; moved from the two rooms reserved with the consolidator to the two rooms reserved directly with Loews since the rooms reserved are of different classes. Check with the reservation desk on Monday @ 3PM and find-out that the new rooms are not ready yet. Go up to the old rooms and find that we have been locked-out. Go back to the reservation desk to get the key cards re-enabled. Go on a shopping trip and come back to the hotel at 5PM -- rooms still not ready. Ask to speak to the manager -- clerk goes to a room behind the reservation desk and comes back a few minutes later -- told person who has one of the new rooms has not checked-out yet -- after much back and forth &quot;reassigned&quot; a single room with two bedrooms.Professionalism  A member of staff mistook my friends wife as part of the hotels housekeeping staff and admonished her for drinking the coffee that is made available in each guests room.Amenities  Furniture and baseboards shopworn; stain in one of the bedspreads; window left open and hard to close because of a bent metal frame plus many years of oxidation."
12,1868,"Aug 26 2009 	""Luxury deals are available""	Contrary to some recent reports, I have little but praise for the Loews Regency Hotel NYC.I booked a 2 bedroom suite in January via Magellan Vacations, at a cost of USD 640.00 per night. The room was circa 1300 square feet, and included a guest washroom/WC, kitchen area, sitting room/dining room c/w 50&quot; Plasma, two large bedrooms c/w 32&quot; LCD's and an entrance lobby. The room allocated (728) was a corner location, with views down Park Av and 61st St.We arranged for airport transfer via Capricorn Limousines (aligned to the hotel) and the whole transfer experience was seamless. Check In was fast and professional, as was the delivery of our luggage. The location of the hotel, 2/3 blocks from Bloomingdales, Central park and 5th Avenue is perfect for those with only a few days to explore the city.In line with many NYC hotels, it is important to impose yourself at the offset. Generous tipping upon arrival invariably ensures a 'smoother' experience, and though not obligatory, is nevertheless expected in an establishment of this calibre. I have previously stayed at the Waldorf Towers and Parker Meridian, and both provide the same outcome.Our rooms were spotless, and the lemonade in the lobby a welcome relief in the heat of the day.A special thanks to Lisa for her kindness in making an unforgettable stay for the girls."
13,1868,"Aug 13 2009 	Elegant with some inconveniences	The lobby is bustling with ladies wearing hats, business men and a few tourists. The lobby bathroom has complimentary amenities and is gorgeous. Rooms are spacious, comfortable. Very pet-friendly. Do beware, however. Internet is $16 for 24 hours, and they have an awkward policy that charges from noon to noon. This means that if you purchase internet at 11am you will have an hour and need to pay another $16. Very illogical. We found the front desk staff to be somewhat rude and unhelpful at times. The hotel is very elegant, but I would expect higher service for the price. Do check out The Library, the hotels restaurant, which is nice and has good food."
14,1868,"Aug 11 2009 	Loews Regency: Getting Tired and Sad	I've been to the Loews Regency many times over the past decade and I'm sorry to report that it's not really the same hotel anymore. The feel of the hotel has changed: from a high-end hotel that catered to a well-traveled and probably demanding clientele (film people, business people, upper tier travelers, diplomats) to, well, a pricier tourist hotel that seems to be overrun with European and Australian tourists. And while you can put up with a snooty attitude when the rest of the hotel balances it out, when that balance doesn't exist, snooty pretty quickly turns into sneery, which leads to annoyance. Whereas the rooms used to be spotless, ours had a fairly large black stain on the floor. The beds were comfortable enough, but they're also starting to show their age--especially when you compare them to Westin's comfy beds, or the pillowtops that a lot of higher-end hotels have now. Other small things. The &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign was missing, as was the tag to hang on your door if you wanted breakfast. And what happened to my free shoe shine? Unfortunately, this seems to be business as usual for Loews. I used to stay at the Loews Santa Monica fairly often, until it too began to get run down and your fellow travelers were all excited about &quot;seein' the movie and tee vee stars.&quot; Blech.Sorry Loews Regency. Give me a call when you renovate."
15,1868,"Jul 25 2009	Wasn't very keen on this hotel at all.	I've stayed at 5 different hotels in New York City in my various visits there. This hotel ranks as my least favourite of the lot and it had the biggest star rating (4.5*).Right from the time I arrived I felt less than welcome. The room was not ready when we arrived, even though it was after 3pm. When we finally did check in, the last occupant's used old shampoo bottles and soap had not been removed upon our arrival. Yuck!The room itself was nothing spectacular, in fact, the bathroom was in rough shape, very dated and not particularly clean.The charges for room service and courtesy bar items were completely outrageous.I would not stay here again."
16,1868,"Jul 3 2009 	Comfortable Stay	Good location on Manhattans Upper East. Excellent room,very clean and comfortable. Friendly Doorstaff and Bellhop.not so friendly duty manager,checked in late so might have had a hard day,either way at these prices you expect service with a hint of a smile!Overall one of New Yorks nicer locations with a top dining experience to boot!"
17,1868,Jul 3 2009 	Stayed 3 days - super pleasant experience with kids	We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in mid April. We had a great 2-bedroom family suite. The locations is superb for kids and shopping and the staff were very professional. Room service was excellent and overall it was great value for money. The decor is a bit dated but the rooms were quiet and very functional with kitchenette in the suites - very good if travelling with small children. Will stay there again.
18,1868,"Jun 27 2009 	A Customer service nightmare	I stayed one night at the Loews Regency New York and I will never make that mistake again. They were perfunctory in every respect. The check-in was late and the clerk tried to pretend with a smirk and a nod that he was &quot;taking care of us&quot;. We were given the same room we would have been given, but the pretense was almost comic. A few days after we checked out, I realized that I had left a dress in the closet of the room. I called and was connected to housekeeping which began what I can only describe as a farce for the next three weeks. I ultimately received the dress after two weeks of phone calls (I honestly believe, I am sorry to say, that someone in housekeeping had claimed my dress for herself and was made to bring it back to work). I paid for shipping and received the dress in ridiculous condition. There were six deliberately made burn marks in it, rips, tears, and some of the seams were shredded. When I called to complain, the manager on duty disconnected me &quot;accidentally&quot;, then re-directed me back to the same woman in housekeeping with whom I had already dealt. She left me a voice mail telling me that the dress was sent to me in perfect condition. Since the packaging in which it was sent was completely intact and still is, this is impossible. Business ethics are not present at this hotel. I am now out the price of the dress, the cost of shipping, the expense of the phone calls, and my time. Spare yourself and find a place that deserves its stars."
19,1868,"May 24 2009 	Beyond expectations	I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Everything was as described in the ads. The room was a good size with large well equipped bathroom, two closets, triple glazing, impeccable housekeeping (room was cleaned twice a day!), doormen who were always there to stop cabs and greet you, concierge who was truly helpful in any questions or suggestions. The slashed prices of the recession were truly the icing on the cake. A big bowl of fresh apples near the elevator was refreshing. Proximity to Central Park and great shopping was indeed a plus. The feeling that security in the hotel worked was quieting. This is definitely a place to recommend and return to."
20,1868,"May 6 2009 	How To Handle A Problem	We reserved a very comfortable and well-appointed 2-bedroom suite at the Park Avenue Loews Regency New York for a weekend beginning May 1, three nights at $793 a night. Virtually everything was to our expectation, and our 4-person party enjoyed their stay, particularly breakfast in the &quot;Library&quot;, absolute joy. Several times we discussed returning again to use the same space. But everything changed Sunday evening. The adjoining suite erupted in an extremely noisy party, every shouted word of which filled the living room of our suite. We called Guest Services and said we could not use our living room and please have the party quieted down. Nothing happened. For the remainder of Sunday we abandoned the living room of the suite, as we had no choice but to confine ourselves to the most distant bedroom. The next morning, paying my $2600 bill at checkout, I went over it all again, and was assured that I would soon be contacted by Management. Subsequently the Front Desk Manager telephoned me with a very sincere apology, and volunteered an adjustment amount to my bill that clearly reflected that they took the situation very seriously. We'll go back soon."
21,1868,"May 5 2009 	Not worth it..snooty staff that act like they own Park Ave.!!	Im a pretty regular travelor and have been to many hotels in my day, and was very excited for my newborn's first trip to NYC and first hotel stay of his life! I searched out many hotels in NYC and was looking for a spacious, affordable, and kid-friendly hotel. Based on reviews, Loews seemed to be the best of all worlds, but I was quite surprised to find that the Regency, NYC lacked in all of those respects. First, the front desk staff was disinterested, aloof, and pretty much as snooty as Park Ave. itself. I asked for a room and they pushed for a kitchenette which would cost $40 more per night, and I said I didnt need one. Sure enough, they gave me a room w/ a kitchenette, but didnt charge me for it..bonus, but not sure what the deal was. I requested a crib upon arrival, and when I got there at 6:30pm, we were taken up to the room by an excellent bellman, but the crib wasnt there yet. When i asked the bellman if I should call downstairs to get it, he said that he was going to take care of it. When we returned from dinner around 10pm with my child sleeping in my arms, still no crib! We called downstairs and they finally came by 11:30 to assemble the crib, which took a half hour, while my child slept on our bed. Next, my room key deactivated twice and I couldn't get into the room, and you would think by the second time, they would have sincerely apologized, but the lady at the front desk barely looked me in the eye, let alone apologized. My wife ordered room service one night, and I know that NYC prices are up there, but she got a grilled cheese and a side salad, which came out to $58...come on! Lastly, the rooms were supposed to be spacious, by NYC standards, yet the bathroom was so tiny that my legs stuck out the door when I sat on the toilet and I hit my head twice on the mirror above the toilet, while knocking the toilet phone off the hook every time I entered the bathroom. So, in summation, crappy experience, staff that was unattentive and snooty..all around bad experience! I expected more of you , Loews!"
22,1868,May 3 2009 	Bring your own laptop!	We stayed at the Regency for a week in November so my husband could run the marathon. We have 3 small children and reserved a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms were well appointed with small kitchen and large living room--plenty of space and with just enough dings and scrapes on the woodwork and walls to make us feel like our kids wouldn't damage the place too much. We had excellent service from everyone...The real problem was computer access. We did not have our laptops and so had to use the business center: $1 a minute!!! With 2 people checking emails it gets expensive in a hurry. The hotel had wifi that we tried to access with our iPhones but you had to agree to similar rates--no thanks! We were paying a small fortune for the rooms and my husband had a fit that we had to pay that much for internet use. We would stay here again for the location and rooms but next time will bring our gadgets!
23,1868,"Apr 19 2009 	Woman travelling alone	When I am in NYC on business, the Regency is my hotel of choice. Although the hotel facility is very inice, I feel that what I am really paying for is unparallelled service and security. Guests are greeted by name and they do know who you are! When, at the last minute, my (very distinguished looking husband) husband was in town and able to join me, I was impressed with the security that was enforced before they even contacted me that he was in the lobby. Restaurant and room service also excellent. The concierge was extremely helpful with entertainment recommendatons and securing reservations for us."
24,1868,"Apr 11 2009 	Perfect for Families and Pet Owners	Loew's is the perfect hotel for pets and families, so I have no idea why everyone keeps thinking they aren't.They guaranteed us connecting rooms for the simple fact that we have children.Feinstein's offers a magic show on Sundays and they looked after our little ones so we could have dinner alone for the evening.Not only that, but we brought our dog and it was only $25!Both our children and our dog receive welcome ammenities, and they did everything they could to make our stay company.I would strongly suggest becoming a Loew's YouFIrst member, as we got an upgrade upon arrival for being a member and a late check-out.Also you should most certainly book through MagellanVacations at NewYorkCityLuxuryHotels.com. They got us a phenomenal rate on our room and they also rebooked us at lower rates twice before our stay."
25,1868,"Jan 20 2009 	Great Location !	Was worried about going to this hotel after reading a couple of reviews, but after arriving and checking in, felt very pleased with my choice. Staff very attentive and friendly We stayed in Room 505, didnt overlook Park Avenue but was the quietest hotel room I think I have ever stayed in, didnt hear anything ever. Housekeeping staff very nice, and did a good job in the room tidying up all my shopping bags for me.Only used the restaurant once for a late night snack, was very yummy, and quite pricey but no more pricey than the rest of NYC.Bar staff very chatty and friendly, nice atmosphere in the lounge bar area, just what you needed after a long day.Room was tidy, the bathroom was modern in the seventies, definately needs a new bathroom ! However saying that the shower was very powerful and the towels were very fluffy, it was just a bit old.Great location within easy walking distance of Central Park and some great shops, Bloomingdales 2 blocks away, but I prefered Macys which is a good 20 minute walk away, but can be done.Great italian restaurant around the corner called serofina. Breakfast we walked to the Wellington Hotel opposite park central and sat in a diner there for breakfast and there is the brooklyn diner opp Carnegie Hall, about 15 mins walk. And Im a slow walker.I dont think I would stay at this hotel again as I do like a nice bathroom !!!! But that is the only reason I would not go back here."
26,1868,"Dec 8 2008 	Your home in NYC	Having stayed at the hotel before, we nearly made the mistake of trying another hotel, for a change. How pleased we were that we decided to stick with The Regency.We reserved a Park Avenue room, with more than ample space for tw persons, and indeed it could easily hold your two children as well!The position of the hotel is perfect if you want to be near most stores and museums, yet be in a calm neighbourhood. The staff, many who have been at the hotel for many years, are just so guest orientated that you might be in the Four Seasons, but 4S is just too big to be comfortable.Restaurants abound, and the subway is near. The only drawback is the current woeful value of the British Pound, makes NYC much more expensive than a year ago.Hope this helps."
27,1868,"Nov 15 2008 	Classy but with flaws	Why classy?? * Great location:  * Just a couple of blocks from Central Park * Very close to the Metros which will get you anywhere you want to go * Staff was outstanding: always willing and able to take care of any needs. Very responsive. * Hotel room: * Room was quite large. * Bed was very comfortable * Kitchenette was nice plusWhy flaws?? Given the price of the hotel, I would have expected 5+ star quality in all areas and it was good but not great. * Rooms are somewhat dated and could use some upgrading. * Bathroom plumbing: drains in sink and tub were very slow to drain. Had to finally call maintenance to come and work on them. They finally got them to flow. * Hallway carpet: hallway carpet on at least two of the floors seemed to be dirty. Certainly not up to the standard expected."
28,1868,"Oct 8 2008 	Great room for a Girls' Weekend	Management went above and beyond to make our weekend special; we were two moms and two teenage daughters celebrating High School graduation and Sweet sixteen events. Our double bedded room was HUGE by Manhattan standards and an exceptional value for the money. The fitness center was available at no charge with luxurious facilities and all the amenities one would want. Great location on Park Avenue, very close to several subway entrances. I have stayed in New York several times per year for twenty years and from now on I will make this may first choice from now on for New York City!"
29,1868,"Oct 5 2008 	Impressive	Great hotel, good size room. Loved the one cup coffee brewer.Bed was very comfortable. Staff helpful - helped us find a nearyby subway entrance and gave us a map and instructions for our first subway experience. Nice touch with the bowl of apples and lemonade stand in the lobby. Not very conveniently located for Broadway shows or Times Square area but great locatiion near Central Park."
30,1868,"Sep 16 2008 	dirty stay	I have traveled all over the world. I generally stay at Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton, and also have stayed in Westins. I was VERY disappointed at the NY location. We stayed at the suite. The hotel was very disappointingly dirty. I am not sure how they are able to manage a business with unacceptable cleanliness. I feel this situation is due to neglect of the management. The room carpets had so many stains. The play area in the breakfast restaurant had crumbs of food. Please clean your act. I own several businesses. I could understand the expenses involved in renovation, but we spent $1000 a night including taxes. If you need to command this price, please follow with a clean location. We almost checked out due to the cleanliness, but decided not to ruin our wedding anniversary. I generally would not write comments, but hopefully accept this as a constructive criticism. I will never stay in another Lowes Hotel due to this experience. We stayed in Room #725. The staff was very helpful."
31,1868,"Sep 15 2008 	Indifferent service and tired accomodations	I had high expectations, and most were not met. An indifferent front door staff -- we were ignored as we struggled to get luggage out of the taxi, as they stood by and watched, and NEVER ONCE in 3 days was a front door opened for us as we entered or left the hotel. The room (Superior King) was spacious, but with an itty-bitty, tiny bath. The rooms and hallways were old and tired, and all a bit dingy. IMPORTANT NOTE: the lack of sound proofing of the rooms was appalling - we could hear every word of the people speaking in the rooms adjacent to ours. The location is excellent, the prices high (the food and drinks were outrageous) and the overall experience more 3-star than 4 or 5-star."
32,1868,Sep 3 2008 	Loved the Regency	Enjoyed a 3 night stay at this upper east side hotel over labor day weekend. Service was excellent and very helpful. King bed in standard room had excellent linens and room was very comfortable. Good work space provided. Beautiful setting on Park Terrace at 61st. Two block walk to Central Park was great for morning jogs. Quiet area with high end shopping one block over on Madison. Convenient for museums. Number of small cafes and bistros within 3 blocks for evening meals. The hotel's Library Bar is a great place to hang out or eat small meals (but very pricy). Found a great deal on the internet and hope to return again.
33,1868,"Sep 2 2008 	Big rooms and great staff!	This was my first trip to NYC and wasn't sure where to stay. I had heard that most rooms in the city were very small so I was prepared. When I opened the door to our room at the Loews Regency I was shocked at how big it was. We had 2 very nice sized closets, a dining table and comfy chair. The staff were also very nice and accommodating. The hotel is in a great location, very close to shopping and Central Park. I would stay here again."
34,1868,"Sep 2 2008	Great Hotel Good Service Excellent Location!	Great hotel, friendly and good location. Rooms not overly luxurious but large and spacious. Great room service but VERY EXPENSIVE! ie $13 for a soft drink from the mini bar!!!$30 for a sandwich (but bloody tasty!!)"
35,1868,"Aug 9 2008 	Park Avenue Gem	We stayed at the Regency for three nights this past week. We love the location on Park Avenue and the neighborhood. Check in is extremely fast and there is an excellent door and front desk staff. Our room on the 10th floor was comfortable, spacious and very clean. The bed and pillows were comfy. Bathroom amenities were very good. Bathroom did not have a fan which is a minus. The hotel floors are quiet, elevators are prompt and housekeeping and turndown services superb. We had drinks in the bar one evening and at $21 per were overpriced even by NYC standards. Nice coffee makers in the room. This is a hotel we return to time after time."
36,1868,"Jul 17 2008 	Nice Very Nice	The friendliest staff I have ever met in a hotel. Welcoming, smiling, check in was a breeze, the room (suite) was excellent. Breakfast at the Regency is a great experience (make a reservation or you won't get in). A helpful concierge gave us lots of things to do.Give yourself a reason to stay there and then enjoy one fine experience."
37,1868,"Jun 29 2008 	Very impressed!	My sister and I usually stay at the Barclay Intercontinental when in New York, but it was booked and we found an affordable promotion through the hotel's web site. We were very impressed with the hotel and liked it much better than the Barclay for many reasons. Although the folks at the front desk were a little aloof, the rest of the staff was cheery, friendly and helpful, even the poor man who had to fix our toilet at 11:00 p.m.! We had requested a non-smoking room and got one, however it was clear the previous guest had smoked and so we requested another room. We were upgraded to a larger room right next door. Although the hallways were a little worn, the room was very well decorated and included a large flat-screen TV and Jonathan Adler pottery. Room service was extremely expensive so we opted to eat downstairs in The Library. Breakfast was yummy and, to top it off, there were bowls of M&amp;Ms everywhere! It is a kid-friendly and pet-friendly hotel and even has a place for kids to play right next to the restaurant.If we can afford it we will definitely return to the Loews Regency."
38,1868,"May 19 2008 	Very Comfortable NYC Hotel	We really enjoyed our stay at the Loew's Regency. It is a smaller hotel with an intimate feel, but unlike many boutique hotels is full service with a nice, albeit small lobby.The Regency is in a lovely residential area on Park Avenue and 61st Street--so if you need to be in the heart of the tourist hubbub--this may not be the place for you. Walking in the nearby neighborhood is a great way to see one of the finest (and wealthiest) NYC neighborhoods.The staff was excellent, from the doormen to the front desk to housekeeping. The rooms are very comfortable with large flat screen TVs, a granite topped desk, and a comfortable chair. The rooms mostly have large picture windows. Excellent bedding and comfortable bed.The little things like providing umbrellas when raining, or having iced tea and apples in the lobby is a great touch and makes you feel like you are home away from home.The hotel is getting near to the time that it needs to be renovated. It's the little things like chipped paint and scratched furniture--but because it is clean and very luxurious, the property is aging gracefully.The Library bar/ restaurant is fun--great for people watching, very intimate and comfortable--but beware of some sticker shock on prices, especially breakfast. We've stayed at a number of NYC hotels and when we want to be on the Upper East Side--this is the place."
39,1868,"May 3 2008 	very nice	We had a room with a king sized bed on the third floor. the view was of an elementary school next door. the room was on the small side for a hotel of this level, but had all of the amenitites. Soft, comfy sheets and great pillow. Plenty of towels and toiletries. My best friend and I traveled to NYC for a girls' weekend to sight see and go to a Broadway show. This hotel seems to be more for business than pleasure stays. The location is more high end residential and is a little out of the way for tourists. There are no late night eateries close by. I would not recommend this hotel for tourists on a tight schedule, due to the distance from tourist attractions."
40,1868,"Apr 10 2008 	Nice New York Hotel	Enjoyable Stay at the Loews- Huge Luxury King Room- Very comfortable room- Nice Big Bed with Lots of pillows- Flat Panel TV- Bathroom Okey, kinda small- Big Work space- Service quality mixed. Doormen greet you by name, but Reception counter staff are generally aloof- Located on Park Avenue. Comfortable walk to 5th ave, Apple Store, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, even to Grand Central Station.- Quiet Part of midtown.- The Free Hot Chocolate during winter is very good and rich.Had a very nice enjoyable stay. Highly Recommended.It was much better than Sheraton Manhattan hotel.Got a great deal from Quikbook online. 2+1 night free."

42,1868,"Mar 26 2008	Just decent and overpriced.	For the $500 or so I paid for the room I expected 'immaculate' and the Regency falls short of that. It is a very nice hotel at a great location but the check-in service was less than friendly. The room was large but odd shaped (a very long hall with 3 huge cabinets). The work area was not optimal, with no electrical outlets under the desk, but at a side wall that was not too close. Your $500 do not buy you free WiFi ($14.95) - but you can easily grab wireless connectivity from the airwaves in the area. The bathroom was clean but the fixtures a bit aged. The shower/bath in particular was cramped and the stream mediocre. Again, not up to snuff for the price. An odd story showing indifferent customer service: a colleague staying at the hotel with me walked into the room he was assigned after checking in only to find it occupied with a couple in the throes of passion. The front-desk's reaction: &quot;We thought they had checked out already.&quot; That was at 9:00 PM. And that was all they had to say about it. Again, not what you'd expect from this class of hotel.If there were other places to stay during this conference-laden week in NYC, I would have tried them. Not a bad hotel at all, but for this amount of money, I would expect much more."
43,1868,"Feb 8 2008 	Probably Won't Return	The hotel was just average. The room was small, but clean. The bathroom needed updating and the door was rusting around the bottom. There were wet spots on the carpet where it appeared that stains had been recently treated. The hallways were tired.The service was also average, which surpised us because Loew's has such wonderful service. At checkin, our complimentary upgrade through the Loew's first program was not even mentioned. At checkout, we noticed that we had not received the correct discount (AAA discount), despite the fact that I had booked with the hotel directly and discussed the discount. Also, it was quite an ordeal for the hotel to even locate the discount that takes 20% off of a Sunday night stay (as found on the site: http://www.nycvisit.com/content/index.cfm?pagePkey=2005&amp;CFID=2115235&amp;CFTOKEN=30338759).On the flip side, the location was great and the doormen were quite pleasant."
44,1868,"Feb 4 2008 	Okay	Nice location on Upper East Side. Easy walk to Central Park and all it has to offer.Booked a 1 bedroom suite with 1.5 baths, kitchenette. Original room was light, bright, and had a small kitchenette, nice terrace facing Park Avenue and great windows, but only a single bathroom. My 12 y/o daughter, who had broken her ankle the week before our trip had a fit. We were moved to another 1 bedroom suite. This one was dark, not as spacious, in need of updating, no microwave, no coffee maker, but it did have 2 bathrooms, so my daughter was happy.The daytime doorman was superb and friendly. He quickly remembered our names and made friends with my 7 year old son. He went out of his way to accomodate us in and out of taxis, as we brought along a wheelchair for my daughter.The concierge was abrupt and not much help for kid-friendly dining options.Continental breakfast through room service was $29.00! Try Burger Heaven at Lexington and 62nd. Three of us had full breakfast with juice for $24.00 including tip! Service was wonderful and pleasant, and the food was decent.Would I stay there again, probably not, nor would I likely recommend it to a friend. There are other, better hotels."
45,1868,"Jan 11 2008 	Another Great Stay at The Regency	I had another great stay at the The Regency the night of January 10, 2008. I booked a standard room for a short business trip and was upgraded upon check in to a 15th floor delxue king room as I am a gold member of the Loew's First loyalty program. Thr room was large by New York standards and there was no street noise at all in the room. I also received a complementary bottle of white wine in my room as per my Loews First profile. Much appreciated! The location of the hotel is excellent.Check in and check out were a breeze and my room was cleaned to perfection. The large flat panel TV was appreciated and the bed was exceedingly comfortable. I did not use the fitness center or dine through room service. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was excellent and served quickly.All in all, this hotel consisently reminds me why I keep returning to The Regency."
46,1868,"Dec 10 2007	Nice stay in midtown	In NYC on business and didn't want to stay downtown. Company travel agent suggested the Regency. The room was good size for NY and looked to be recently renovated. Large flat panel TV and a small desktop area made my stay. Bed linens were nice and the decor was modern, but not funky. Lobby bar/restaraunt was nice, but expensive. I didn't get a chance to walk around too much around there, but given the mid town location, I imagine you are a short cab ride from everything. All things considered, you get a good hotel for the rate."
47,1868,Nov 6 2007 	Perfect postiion	We stayed here for 4 nights in a junior suite. The suite was not large but by New York standards was more that adequate. The position was perfect for fifth avenue and Bloomingdales. Also the subway station was really close. The staff were fantastic - so helpful and the complementary umberellas came in really usefull on the rainy day! We did not eat in the hotel because we wanted to try lots of places but the free coffee in the lobby each morning was nice. The gym was well equipt and we used it every morning (yes really!)We would stay here again.
48,1868,"Oct 5 2007 	Comfortable Stay	I stayed at the Regency for one week while in New York on business. I'd heard great things about the hotel, and while I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't completely blown away either. It is a great hotel, overall. The housekeeping service/turndown service was wonderful- really really great. The rooms are supremely spacious, although the bathrooms are rather small with unattractive lighting. I was disappointed with the gym hours, although the gym is very nice. I understand it was recently renovated. Still, I'd have enjoyed it much more if it opened earlier, or if guests had 24-hr access. The staff is awesome- everyone is sooo nice. Especially the woman who was at the desk when I checked out, I do regret not catching her name. She was just completely precious and set me off on my day in a great mood. The only other thing I'd comment on is the room service- not good service, but the gentleman who served it was delightful. I'm telling you, the staff in this hotel is awesome. Overall, nice stay, but then again, the company was paying. If I were paying, I might choose another hotel in the area."
49,1868,"Sep 3 2007 	Loews Regency sorry not for me	Good:Location/NeighborhoodService/Staff is perfectBed &amp; Pillows are #1Limonade in lobby in the afternoonQuiet hotelHousekeeping and turndown servicesBad:Old hotel, need a big major makeoverOutdated room/Bathroom (2 tiles did fall down during shower) Small room/Bathroom with no ventilationRoom service prices and xtra fee(21%fee + 5$ a guest)is a jokeWay too expensive, you have much better hotel for same price or less (Sofitel hotel is still my favorite in NYC)Loews shoud put money in the hotel and stop thinking that the friendly employees will make up for the running down hotel"
50,1868,"Aug 25 2007 	Great home away from home.	Wonderful Hotel. 4 day weekender with two adults and three children (9-14). We stayed in a huge two room suite overlooking Park Ave. . 1100 sq. ft. with 3 closets and 1 1/2 baths, refrigerator and microwave. Sofa bed was useable but in poor shape, but the two rollaways the hotel provided were perfect for the kids. The room was on special discount via Leows hotels and offered best value I found in NYC--two small rooms at nearby Sheraton or Hilton would have cost more and provided half the space.The neighborhood is the perfect location for a nyc trip. Easy access via Park Ave. and great location to Central Park (2 blocks) &amp; Bloomingdales, Madison &amp; Fifth Ave. shopping all within easy walking distance of a few blocks. One block east to Lexington Ave (or two blocks east to Third Ave.) and there are a host of deli and supermarket choices, burger joints or fine dining--whatever you prefer. We visited the &quot;top of the rock&quot; for views of the city from the top of Rockefeller Center...The &quot;Rock&quot; is definitely a &quot;tourist&quot; destination, but if you like looking down on the city, the views are tremendous and there were no lines. The observation areas are very clean and the glass walls around the observation deck don't obstruct views like the screens/fences surrounding the Empire State Building. We also tried the circle-line double decker bus downtown tour. We picked up the bus at central park...just a few blocks from the hotel. The kids loved that as well...and they liked hopping off and back on a different bus at various stops. Two tour guides were great, one was a cynical jerk, but hey it's NYC and you never know what you're gonna get. The great thing about the buses is that you can hop off at any time.Cab rides even from downtown were never more than 10-12 dollars and there is easy access to the hotel. Subway entrances are also just a few blocks away.Regency Hotel went out of the way to make our stay enjoyable--they provided umbrellas from the doorman if it was raining. free coffee (delicious) in the lobby in a.m. and free lemonade in the afternoon. The housekeeping staff provided everything we needed right away. It's been a long time since I stayed in NYC and felt welcomed and not simply like I was being &quot;processed&quot; through the hotel system. The neighborhood also felt safe and clean. This will definitely be our hotel of choice for future visits."
51,1868,"Aug 25 2007 	Dependable 4-star Great location.	We stay here about once or twice a year. Prices are generally competitive for New York- this time I paid just over $420 net per night. Rooms are clean and quiet, location couldn't be better, and if you join Loews First, you can generally get an upgrade to next larger/better room/suite. Restaurants are great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and after dinner. But I usually want breakfast before they open. In that case, walk one block over (right out of hotel, right on 60th, right on Madison) and eat at Viande Coffee Shop. Fast basic food and they must open for business at dawn- I've never arrived &quot;too early&quot; for a quick hearty breakfast."
52,1868,"Aug 12 2007 	Good location Adequate room	My husband and I stayed 3 nights and had a good experience. The staff was well trained, the location good and the room, although not special, met our needs.Nice location to get to shopping, but I would not recommend dining in the restaurant. I wanted a beverage one evening and got a mini can of diet coke for a whopping $7. The bowls of free M &amp; M's almost made up for it...but not quite!"
53,1868,"Aug 10 2007 	Very nice employees but a disappointment	We have just returned from a week at the Regency. The hotel was a very big disappointment. First, let me say I have been to NY several times and know that the room standards in New York are sometimes below other hotels in other parts of the country, but based on the reviews and our vacation club recommendations we booked a luxury room with two double beds. Upon arrival, I found the staff very very friendly. They had toys for my kids and were very courteous to my wife and I. The hotel is well off the tourist path and you might need to give the taxi driver the cross streets, since some did not know where the regency was located (park and 61st). Since the hotel is away from the hot spots, the noise from &quot;the city that never sleeps&quot; does not keep you awake. OK, now for the bad stuff. We were given a room on the third floor. When the hotel elevator doors open to this floor we were greeted with the great smell of ciggarette smoke. We are not talking about a light smell, but one that gives you the impression that this floor has seen years of smoke. Keep in mind, Im a ex-smoker and normally the smell does not bother me, but wow. Once we got to our room, we found it very large (by NY standards) with two double beds as promised along with a good size bathroom and a small kitchen net. You can tell the rooms have been occupied a lot by the amount of stains in the carpet. I always get very paranoid by the color of some of the stains.... Once i sat down on the bed, I noticed a very very strong vomit odor coming from the top right side of the bed. I immediately called down and was told that someone will be up soon. Within 2 mins, a maid had come to change the sheets. I asked for another room, but was told that there were none available until tomorrow. The following day, my wife was too scared to change rooms in fear that the new one would be worst. For anyone traveling with kids, sometimes you need things in the night to help with the boredom. One thing might be a movie on the on demand television. Well on the first night we tried to use this service we were billed, but no movie played. We, again, had to call the front desk to get the charge removed from our bill and were told the on demand service is not working in the hotel. We also found out our mini bar was missing...even though we had a mini bar key...lol. This meant that we had to order room service for a soft drink. (there were no machines in the hotel and no outside vendors in this area). I will say, even though we called down to the front desk more then I have ever done before, I can tell you the staff were never short with us and were very patient. As someone who likes to travel, I can tell you it would take a lot for me to stay at this hotel again."
54,1868,"Jul 1 2007 	Great hotel - very pet friendly	Stayed at the Regency on business in April for four nights. My husband and small dog came along. Loews is great with pets. Our room was at the end of the hall, which is great when you have a pet and was very spacious. They provided dog bowls and treats and we were allowed to leave our dog in the room unattended. Our room was spotless, it is obvious that the hotel is very well maintained. Room service the three or four times we ordered it was delivered promptly and the food was of very high quality. There are three reasons that I give this hotel a 4 rather than a 5. First, it's pricey, even by New York standards. I believe our double room was $479 per night. Second, if you are scouting this hotel for tourism, the location is not supurb, it is somewhat far from the major tourist areas. It is, however, perfect for the Lex and Park area. Lastly, it's an older hotel and the soundproofing is not very good. It is a loud place, which is bothersome in the mornings if you are attempting to sleep in.Overall, I'd definitely return, mostly due to their wonderful treatment of pets."
55,1868,"Jun 13 2007 	Very pleasant stay	This was a very nice place to stay! Just a couple of blocks from Madison Ave. and Central Park. 3 of us stayed in a suite which had a kitchenette, living room, king bedroom and 2 bathrooms, and plenty of closet space!!!! The room was clean and tastefully decorated. No clutter! The bathrooms were a little small but fine enough. The bedding was clean and very comfortable!!! the couch was cushy and comfy as was the cot they brought in for one of us. The extra blankets they brought in were soft and when we requested them, they had just come out of the dryeer and were warm:) The housekeeping cleaned up the bathrooms daily which was nice. The towels were clean(I've been to hotels where the towels were not!) Even though the mini bar was pricey, we still enjoyed some of it:) We didn't eat in the restaurant but did have lunch in the Library, which was nice, very tasty food! Room service was pricey, the food was good but nothing special. Your best bet would be to hit up a local grocery. The hotel staff including the housekeeping, maintenance and doormen were very friendly. We were on the 10th floor near the elevator which we did hear the noise from that, but it wasn't that bad and we had no problems getting to sleep after shopping all day!!! This is a pet friendly hotel and we noticed several guests had dogs, but we never heard any barking and the place didn't smell at all of pets. We plan to stay again because of the closeness to Madison Ave and because it was such a pleasant stay!"
56,1868,"Jun 4 2007 	Regency aims to please!	Just got back from a weekend at the Regency in NYC and it was a wonderful experience. I went with my significant other and my daughter. My goal was to book a hotel room that was comfortable with plenty of room for the three of us. We booked an Executive Suite and it worked out perfectly. This room had a king sized bed and french doors that opened to a second living area with a queen pull out sofa. It also had two bathrooms - I was nervous this would take away from the spacious living areas but they did not. The bathrooms themselves were small but had everything you could possibly need including great water pressure and the cleaning staff did an excellent job straightening up and replenishing everything. Their were plenty of drinks and snacks but we did not touch them as they were a bit pricey. I would definately stay at the Regency again. Overall the hotel was very clean and the staff went out of their way to make you feel comfortable, from the door man, folks at the front desk, room service, even the parking garage, it was a pleasant experience."
57,1868,"Jun 1 2007	My favorite in NYC	This hotel is my first choice in New York, although it is frequently full or very expensive. It is not the most luxurious in the city, or even close, but the rooms are comfortable and the staff is excellent. The food is very good, but forget about breakfast. It is a hotspot for breakfast meetings or when you want to 'accidentally' run into someone in the NY real estate scene, so the average hotel guest can't run down and grab a bite. However, there are excellent choices nearby.Don't forget to bring home some of the Hero Stars, if you have a dog."
58,1868,"May 29 2007 	Excellent location - close to the Park between shopping and arts	I can't say enough how wonderful The Regency was. We stayed during Memorial Day weekend. The staff was friendly and always accommodating. There were numerous taxis on Park Ave and because of the location, everywhere we went that weekend was within a $5 taxi fare. There is shopping just around the corner on 5th Ave. There are excellent restaurants all along Madison and Lexington Ave, both one block away. The rooms were great, even if the view was typical of New York - facing another nearby building. The internet connection was good."
59,1868,"May 26 2007 	Our NYC base for sure	We have had some really unpleasant rooms in NYC and were hoping for a good experience here- and we got it! The hotel was lovely and verywell situated for us; we got off our transatlantic flight and took a nice hot bath, felt great!We were given a lovely huge room on the 11th floor, but it was right next to the elevator and sounded like being above the subway- much too noisy for us. We went down and they could not have been nicer about exchanging, gave us the keys to 3 rooms and told us to pick. We selected room 630 facing Park Avenue, even bigger than the first, with a small hidden kitchen facility- perfect for keeping drinks cold or snacks handy. I could not have been more pleased. I am super sensitive about smoke scents and I did not get a whiff, I was worriedabout what a prior reviewer noted. NYC is certainly expensive for hotels but this one was a gem, excellent value for the price. Loved the bedding and the staff, the nice view along Park and deep bathtub.My only nit-picks would have to be the in the bathroom- someone did a lousy job painting the bathroom door and left a swipe on the tiles.Sink had think cracks, which seemed unacceptable in a room of this caliber.But for sure this is our new NYC base and we feel very fortunate to have found it."
60,1868,"Apr 4 2007 	The Regency is a excellent choice in NY	Excellent location for Park Ave , 5th Ave etc., friendly staff, classic oversized rooms, and a terrific service. The afternoon tea at the Library is the best way to rest after a busy day."
61,1868,"Apr 1 2007 	Avoid the lower floors	Reviews calling this a slightly faded beauty are correct. Dull but safe uptown location, big rooms, HD TVs, friendly staff, near lots of attractions and subway and a short walk to the park. Big warning: the lower floors are used for movie interview sessions where thousands of cigarettes are smoked. The result was my 3rd floor room absolutely stunk like a thousand dirty ashtrays. The industrial air purifier in each room seems like a perk until you realize that it is fighting a losing battle to the stench. Even smokers will want to insist on a higher floor or a non smoking room and step outside."
62,1868,"Mar 15 2007	Great hotel	We stay at this hotel on an annual basis for with our Show dog for the Westminster Kennel CLub dog show at Madision Square Gardens each feb, The staff is very friendly, welcomes us back each year and our precious poochies, Loews truly does love PETS. The One bedroom suites are lovely and massive in size, a great little kitchen ( fridge Microwave, sink, small oven , kettle) comes in handy to store your little goodies, The Library in the lobby is a great place for a quick bite or late night snacks and drinks, All the doormen and front desk staff greet you each and every time you enter the hotel. The location of this hotel is amazing, you can walk almost anywhere, and getting a cab is no issue at any time. The rooms do not come cheap $850 a nite for a one bedroom suite, but this hotel is worth every penny..."
63,1868,"Feb 17 2007 	Terrific Spot	My husband stays here for business one or two nights at a time, about 8 times a year. He travels weekly across the US so he's been in a lot of hotels. The staff here is very pleasant. The rooms are big compared to many other NY hotels of the same price range. It is a unique place in the city and just the right size to offer enough amenities and personal attention. It is always our first choice of hotels if we are traveling together and we want to stay in mid-town."
64,1868,"Jan 31 2007 	Great stay at the Loews Regency	I am sitting in my bed at the Regency as I write this review :)My trip to NYC started in another hotel, which was pretty dirty. I was ready to get the heck out of that property and over to the Regency!Check-in was fast, even though there was an error in my reservation which was NOT the hotels fault.I stopped by the concierge to ask a few questions. They were funny and both had kind eyes. That sounds funny, but you know you can just feel when someone is genuinely nice.I head up to my room and was so happy when I walked in! I believe my room is a standard room. It is decorated in a minimalist decor, which I love. Loads of space, lots of counter space, 2 closets and large tub. The 'desk' is really a marble counter that extends the full width of the room. There is a large plasma TV, stereo, and Bloom bath products.The robe is great... and I never bother with robes. It is silk with a soft terry lining. Water pressure is excellent. Bed is HARD. I have a Select Comfort at home and generally I find hotel beds to be hard, but this one is really firm. Beautiful linens.This room is SPOTLESS. Possibly one of the cleanest I have ever been in (out of hundreds).I don't usually let anyone in the room once I check in... no housekeeping, no room service, no turn down. I just don't like it.Today housekeeping was in the neighboring room when I got back (1pm). The lady practically begged for me to let her clean my room. I went ahead and let her. She was just the nicest lady... very concerned for the guests in her rooms. Again, it did not seem fake. I tipped her very well, but I don't really think she was expecting it. Really. I met a guy (in a suit) in the elevator that was talking to the cleaning staff and I asked him what he does at the hotel... he INSPECTS the rooms after they are cleaned! Maybe that's why they are so spotless.The mini-bar is not electronic, so I was able to run down to Whole Foods and buy food for my whole stay and stick it in the fridge. Great... I hate eating out.There is a 24 hour mini-mart just around the corner for last minute purchases. Free hot chocolate (very rich) was at the elevator each evening, apples too.The doorman were really very nice as I walked in and out during the past few days. I attended a Departures magazine presentation yesterday and they were talking about 5,6 and 7 star (YES!) hotels. They were trying to explain to us the values of the very rich.Well, I am probably one of the least demanding travelers... I need a good location and I expect a clean, clean room, good amenities, services and quality furnishings. This hotel meets all my simple requirements Genuinely nice employees are a bonus!I hope I get to stay here again."
65,1868,"Jan 9 2007	Tired Looking Hotel Passing off as Luxury - Good Location	This hotel is very nicely located on 61st street at Park Avenue - easy walking or subway distance to most places in Manhattan.The lobby is attractive, large and inviting. The room we stayed in was large for NY standards and you could tell it was decorated nicely and it was a luxurious room a few years ago - however, it's tired and shabby and needs a facelift now. Maybe this is because pets are allowed? I don't know the reason but a renovation is in order.I don't really have any complaints about the hotel or service but I didn't deem this as luxury.The bathroom was fairly large but again needed a facelift. The bed was comfortable and the room had all the mod-cons."
66,1868,"Dec 27 2006 	Lovely ambience very friendly staff	My husband and I and our two small dogs have just spent a couple of days at the Regency and I would do it again. This is not an inexpensive hotel. Valet parking alone is more than $50 per day and tipping is expected and expensive. (When my husband handed the doorman a $20 bill, asking for change for the tip, the doorman gave him back a $10.00 bill!) But, the room was very nice and a good size with tasteful decorations. Room service was prompt and efficient. My dogs enjoyed the Loew's Loves Pets menu. The location is excellent and the staff is very pleasant. Overall, an enjoyable experience that I would repeat again, but as I said before, it is not even remotely for the budget minded."
67,1868,"Dec 27 2006	Very classy hotel	We had a free certificate for a Loew's hotel because of a bad experience at another Loews hotel. This hotel is just lovely. The lobby is understated, the staff very, very welcoming. The room was gorgeous--nicely appointed with home touches, something you would see in Metropolitan Home or Elle Decor Magazines for a master bedroom. The room was huge was an entry way which included a large closet and large bath with double sinks, a separate shower and deep bathtub. The room had several chairs, a lounge, king bed with lovely linens. We were given a nice fruit bowl and two bottles of Fiji water and Hannukah chocolates at turn down. The location is wonderful. We were able to walk to Lincoln Center in 20 minutes at a leisurely pace. It was a most pleasant experience and Loew's redeemed itself."
68,1868,"Oct 17 2006	Everything about this hotel is fabulous	This hotel is one of the best in New York. Very friendly staff, from the doormen to the concierge!! Beautiful comfortable beds.Close to everything!"
69,1868,"Oct 1 2006 	A fantastic hotel	This hotel is in a great location, especially for the subway and Bloomingdales! We did recieve a room upgrade which might effect this review but the staff were very friendly.When it was very cold outside, quite often in February, they have free hot chocolate and marshmallows in the lobby (next to the lift)They will store your bags for free if you have to check out."
70,1868,"Sep 23 2006 	The Regency On Park Avenue is good but a boost is needed	I've stayed at The Regency On Park Avenue too many times to count, and I've always enjoyed the hotel, even with minor quibbles. My stays are the result of business trips. I've noticed that Loew's, which owns the hotel, has placed its name in a more prominent place alongside the words The Regency Hotel. This month my stay was for one night, over Thursday and Friday,I rarely think of Loew's as a luxury-oriented chain, and I think that's the reason things are not as terrific as they once were at The Regency.The bathroom toiletries are less deluxe; seemingly Loew's generic; whereas The Regency used to provide high-end toiletries. The towels are still good; the bath towel is especially fluffy and large.I was stunned to hear, at around 8 a.m. Friday morning, women from Housekeeping knocking on doors on my floor. That's absurd and much too early. This never happened as recently as 2005. And it should not happen at all. The woman tapped on my door and I ignored it. She even tried the door, but the extra &quot;chain-like&quot; security catch was linked, so she couldn't get in.The Reception Desk personnel were friendly, but not quite deluxe. I did not avail myself of the Concierge. The various uniformed gentlemen at the front door were always friendly and provided greetings. They were a little understaffed on Friday afternoon when I needed to get a cab to the airport.The bed was good; the air conditioning/heat fan system worked well. The room was quiet, clean, and pleasant. It was a standard room consisting of a very large and comfortable bed, crisp sheets, dresser, mini-bar (yes, nuttily overpriced), desk, and good size closet. The carpet was fine, although a cosmetic cleaning wouldn't hurt. The view out my 12th floor window was pleasing. I was away from Park Avenue, so the silence was golden. My biggest complaint was with Room Service, which actually blamed a longer waiting period on - get this - the fact that it was raining outside. What? Were they sending out for the food? Food was promised in one hour - ridiculous since the kitchen knows the menu and the foodstuffs are on the premesis. I've always found 30 minutes to be the norm at high-end hotels. I ordered Room Service at around 9:30 p.m.As for the food, well it failed. I ordered a bacon and turkey club sandwich, but it really wasn't a club sandwich at all, but two very large slices of toasted Italian bread with the dull and lifeless sandwich items within. The bread was too thin, thus it was hardish. The sandwich was cut in two sections and was more a panini than a club. My French fries were coolish. Is it so difficult to provide HOT French fries. And I hate cold or cool French fries. The sorbet was fine, well-chilled in a bowl set over ice; therefore it didn't melt as I hate my entree. The chicken soup was good, but not plentiful. And, of course, there was the absurd &quot;delivery fee,&quot; which I have found, still find, and always will find offensive. Are we able to go down and get the food ourselves? It isn't called ROOM SERVICE for nothing. This fee is actually an insult. I don't mind the normal 16%, 17%, or 18% tip fee - you live with it, but this delivery fee is so tacky.The Regency has a great location with quick steps to Madison or Fifth Avenue. One big problem is that if you want your own &quot;corner store&quot; or &quot;deli&quot; service, you won't fnd any along this stretch of Park Avenue or even a block up on Madison. I tried. You'll need to walk over to Lexington or maybe Third. The shops on Madison begin their high-end run, with Barney's anchoring a corner. The Regency is around 62nd Street and Park.Look, I consider myself fortunate that my work allows me stay in deluxe hotels. There are people who never even travel, let alone get to stay so well around the country. But, hotels that promise luxury need to live up to that claim. The Regency is slipping. My room was clean and pleasant. But overall, the hotel itself needs a little boost. High-end means luxury. And that's what I used to expect and once received from The Regency. It should make a return. Better toiletries in the bathroom would be a start. This stay was average, not wonderful. Definitely not Four Seasons style."
71,1868,"Sep 10 2006 	great location worn out hotel	this hotel has a fabulous location on Park Ave. a block from the best shopping on Madison Ave. Prices are pretty decent for the size of the room, location and NYC in general. Staff are courteous and friendly by NY standards.We had a verly large 1 bedroom suite. The hotel just was not well-maintained or clean enough. There were two phones in the room that did not work. A doorknob was falling off. The hallway carpet was stained and worn and the room was dusty. Housekeeping was very weak when we were there - i.e. they do not throw out an empty soda can unless you put it directly into the trash. Bathrooms are very small....we did have two.I would pay more and stay in a better hotel next time....or even the pay the same and stay someplace like a W that would have a newer, fresher feel.This place is really stale. It's a shame. It has real potential b/ of the location and size of the rooms.."
72,1868,"Aug 31 2006 	A nice experience	We stayed at The Regency for 5 nights. The weather was not the greatest, but I can't fault the hotel on that. ;)We stayed in a Luxury Room which was of adequate size for two people. Unlinke others who have noted a &quot;worn out&quot; look to the hotel, we did not find any issues with my room. The bed and sheets were very comfortable. The bathroom was nice, but a bit on the small side.The concierge was fairly helpyful when it came to restaurant and sightseeing recommendations. The doormen were very attentive on weekdays (when the business travellers were there), and less so on weekends (when the families were there).We did not try the room service as it was quite pricey. The cleaning staff was courteous for the most part with the exception of the incident below.We were in the process of changing clothes just before dinner time to go out in the evening, and without any knock or warning, the cleaning lady walked into our room. I let the concierge know about the incident, but they did not really do much other than say &quot;Sorry&quot;.One tip ... if you want to use the Internet there, purchase an daily access pass or multi-day access pass directly through WayPort, and not through the hotel directly. We paid $8/day for the Internet, rather than the hotel's rate of $15/day.The nicest touch was the free umbrellas provided at the door one rainy days. They are very nice umbrellas."
73,1868,Jul 19 2006 	Fantastic Hotel!	My husband and I stayed for two nights and this hotel was perfect for us! Everything from our large room and the hotel staff were terrific and we honestly didn't have a single complaint. The hotel offers lemonade during the day and when we went to get a glass it was finished. It just so happen a hotel staff person saw that we didn't get any so he called to get more lemonade made and then he called our room to inform us the fresh supply was ready for us! Every single staff member we came in contact with during our stay gave us such good attention and service.Our favorie part of the stay was our amazing large bathroom. It was probably bigger than most NYC apartments. It even had a small television in there! The best part about this room was that we used our reward points to stay and we still were able to get this spacious room. The Regency Hotel is also within walking distance to many attractions. We couldn't have picked a more perfect hotel for our weekend getaway. We look forward to coming back soon!
74,1868,"Jul 17 2006	Regency.. A Winner!	We stayed at the Regency July 7-9, 2006. The hotel is located at Park Avenue and 61st street. The location is excellent if you want to be minutes from Central Park and the upscale shopping on Madison and 5th Avenues. The hotel is very clean, the rooms spacious (for NewYork) and comfortable. The bedding is great! Feinstein's, the restaurant in the hotel is beautiful, but very over priced like most hotel restaurants. We enjoyed a yummy breakfast at Viande dinner located just around the corner on Madision. Lunch at La Goulue is a French Bistro treat (on Madison at 64th street). Go on Sunday for the brunch. It's expensive ($38.00 pp), but it's delicious. A great italian restaurant was recommended by the concierge. It's called La Scientalla. Huge portions. Share your entree. Excellent service in a high end neighbourhood restaurant. I usually stay at the Omni, but I prefer the quiet luxury of the Regency."
75,1868,"Jun 11 2006	Sad and Tired	Surprised to see all the excellent reviews for this hotel. While the staff were very nice, the rooms are old and tired. In the king deluxe room, the bathroom is very small. There is only one sad chair...fine if you are alone on business but a little awkward when traveling as a couple. The wallpaper in the room was a mess and it obviously had not been replaced in along time. The furniture is also quite worn. If you are going into the city on a weekend there are much better hotels for the same money. On the positive side, Feinsteins at the Regency is a great place to hear live music in a very intimate atmosphere."
76,1868,"Apr 10 2006	Great Stay--Perfect for Kids	We stayed at the Regency for three nights in April. We traveled with our 2 1/2 year old child. PERFECT HOTEL FOR KIDS in a city environment--within quick walking distance of the park (Zoo, flying horses), FAO, Dylan's candy bar etc. The staff was incredibly friendly, especially to our daughter. They gave a gift upon arrival, a welome basket for kids and a nice amenity as well. We were staying in a standard room and found the room to be spacious by city standards and very clean. We didn't feel cramped even with a crib in the room.The bathroom is small but well appointed. We really had no complaints at all about our stay. It is not the Ritz but you aren't paying Ritz prices. The overly nice staff makes up for it and they were more than willing to offer great suggestions for dining or child-friendly excursions."
77,1868,"Mar 29 2006	Love this hotel!	My family and I stayed at the Regency for 4 nights and we loved it so much! We had 3 rooms but 2 of them were corner room and it was very big beautiful room. We loved the &quot;library&quot;(bar, tea room &amp; salon, I guess) and my grandmother and I hang out there before we go out for dinner. One problem we had was that one one of the room key was not working well and my father couldn't enter his room for a few times. Everytime, they need to fix the room key card but he had to go down for 3 times and that was not pleasant.. But besides that, we adored this hotel. You really get the upper side new york feeling."
78,1868,"Mar 19 2006 	Perfect Manhattan!	We've stayed at the Regency several times during the past couple of years. Our very first visit made us loyal and each return visit has been better than the last! The location is absolutely perfect and the staff is amazing. During each visit we've seen movie stars, sports stars or famous politicians. I've heard that among celebrities it's known as &quot;Hollywood East&quot;. I guess if it's good enough for them . . . it's good enough for us. There may be a nicer hotel somewhere in Manhattan but after 15 years of searching we have't found one. We're always nervous that if we recommend a hotel to friends, perhaps they won't like it as much as we do. This is one of three hotels in America that I'd recommend without hesitation. Several friends have actually come back and thanked us profusely for letting them in on this New York &quot;secret&quot;."
79,1868,"Mar 18 2006	nice hotel very expensive	nice hotel. very expensive. staff were very accomodating. The rooms were quite spacious. The hotel carpet in our room needed to be replaced. The hotel is very nice, but too expensive for what you get. The"
80,1868,Mar 9 2006	This was my 10th stay here	I have stayed at the Regency at least 10 times in the last four years. The staff is so friendly and I have stayed in the average room and in a couple of the suites. The hotel is vintage and therefor all the rooms are slightly different. I have always had good experiences here and occassionaly have seen a few celebrities which obviously chose the property because they value your privacy. Hot chocolate in the winter and lemonade in the summer!!! My favorite hotel of all in the Big Apple!
81,1868,"Feb 28 2006	Good but not great stay....	After much research on where to stay in NYC, we chose the Regency because we wanted to try a hotel on the Upper East Side. When my husband and I first checked in we inquired on the type of room we would have. We had a standard but could buy 120sq.ft. for an additional $40 per night. We decided to check out the room first and decided to stay, figuring we wouldn't spend a lot of time in the room anyways (which we didn't).The room furnishings are nice and for New York standards the room wasn't that small. My only complaint is the bathroom. The bathroom was small and also very warn. The bathroom door was chipped and corroding at the bottom. Another review mentioned a seperate tub and shower, not in this room. Plus there was mold in the shower soap holder. Okay, one more complaint, it was more the norm than not to see housekeeping carts and room service trays in the hall way that was never vacuumed.Our other beef is with the price of room service. We knew it wouldn't be cheap, but these prices are almost gouging. If 2 people ordered 1 hamburger a piece, the price would be $60 and that is without tax and without something to drink - ouch.However, after saying that, our stay was nice. The location is wonderful and the staff, were very friendly, helpful and accomodating. But, next time I think we'll return to Midtown and stay at the Sofitel, where we have stayed before and thoroughly enjoyed it."
82,1868,Feb 17 2006	Loved the Regency	Our first room was small and dark and the bathroom lights did not work. After pointing that out we did get an upgrade to a fantastic room. Staff was more than willing to help and very responsive. We stayed during a very cold period and the hotel had a really wonderful hot chocolate stand in the lobby....And it was GOOD hot chocolate. Very near Central Park. It's a good walk to the theater district but that was fine.
83,1868,"Feb 3 2006	Wonderful experience!	We, my two daughters, my mom and I, spent a Saturday night at the Regency, and could not have enjoyed our experience more!!! From the very first phone call to the Regency, to when we left the hotel, we had impeccable service, and an unforgettable experience in NY!Our trip had been planned for my Mom's birthday, and was a surprise to her. We had an executive suite which allowed all of us to stay together, which was ideal. The living room area of the suite allowed all the family to gather for birthday cake after dinner, which was very relaxing and allowed all of us to be comfortable together. Brunch in the Library the next morning was quite a treat, and our waiter, everyone at the front desk, concierge desk, and the doormen were wonderfully solicitous, and provided excellent service. We would love to make a stay at the Regency an annual treat after this incredible experience."
84,1868,"Jan 19 2006 	My favourite hotel	The Regency is my favourite hotel anywherre, I've stayed there four times and rate it very highly. The rooms are very comfortable, the maid service first class and I feel at home as soon as I lay my bag down.My favourite thing about the hotel is the gym. It is easily the best hotel gym I've used - if you like free weights it's ideal. Gym staff are (like all the staff) very friendly and helpful. To be walk in the gym for the first time of a visit (about 6 months after my previous visit) and be greeted by name by one of the guys working there really blew my mind!"
85,1868,Jan 8 2006	Great Hotel	The Regency might be one of the best in city and possibly the country. The rooms and service were very good. We would definitely stay there again.
86,1868,"Dec 11 2005 	Pretty good hotel but the service charge - ouch!	Stayed there for 3 nights. You don't expect any view at that location and there wasn't. And in the middle of NY city you don't expect tranquility either from the traffic or the heating / aircon. The room was very big (don't know if it's standard), bathroom didn't feel too small espeically with it's separate shower - the TV was a curiousity considering reception there is terrible. Housekeeping is excellent. The bed is fanstastic.Food is neither good nor reasonably priced and neither is room service at all fast. And yes, the 21% service charge, and $5 per person 'delivery charge', and of course the waiters still expect a cash tip on top... Although they try hard there's always something missing in the order, and since the simplest things take at least half an hour to arrive you just have to give up. I had a chilled seafood salad in my room - a whole, shelled lobster, 3 giant prawns (still 'shrimps') which were tasteless, and a mountain of shelled crab and salad. For a couple of dollars less I ordered the lobster salad in the Library, and you get half a lobster and a few leaves! And don't have the Amish chicken - it's truly uptight!Wired internet is a mystery, and I hooked up to an unsecured wireless connection - perhaps thats why my laptop isn't working now.The location is excellent for shopping, central park, museums and art galleries. The staff are courteous and try to please - I asked for a late checkout and they tried to oblige although they were full. Overall its a pretty good hotel - I'm just glad I was on expenses, and don't bother with the food."
87,1868,Oct 26 2005	Not luxury but good first class	Location is the best in NY. Hotel is very nice first class hotel; Home-away-home -type accommodation. House keeping is keeping the rooms very clean. Bathrooms have old tiles (back to building time?) but new stone floor and counter tops. A lot of high-quality towels which were changed daily. No ventilation in bathroom.Some parts are little dated and need some fresh-up.Room service breakfast is VERY expencive with automatic 21% gratuity. I have styed in many real luxury hotels but never met 21% tips. Is this a record high?
88,1868,"Oct 6 2005	I feel ripped off!	I recently stayed at the Regency for 3 nights at a rate of $400. per night plus taxes. The room was dark and dingy. The sheer white curtains were beige, the windows weren't soundproofed and I just had the feeling that the room hadn't been updated in years. The bathroom was marble but all stained and the grout was falling out. I complained but they said no other rooms were available. Upon checkout, on my bill was a minibar charge of $50. that I refused to pay. I never opened the minibar but the receptionist said I was smart to catch it since most people don't! Hmmmm. Well, I won't go back there again."
89,1868,"Aug 13 2005	A little sad about the Regency	We stayed in the Regency for 4 nights. I've stayed there before and encountered no problems, but this time was different. We were not able to check in till around 3:45 PM, though I had requested early check in. The room needed repair, though small, an area of the ceiling needed repair and the carpet in a small area needed repair. The closet door didn't work and one light didn't work as well. The stay went fine and the cleaning staff does an excellent job. I would not rate this hotel at this time a 5 star. I think it is time to update at least some of the rooms. I'm not sure, but we did get the room at a special rate and maybe that is why the room was a little less than expected and we had problems upon check in."
90,1868,"Aug 8 2005	First time there we loved it	Stayed at the Regency for the first time for three nights in late July, and it was great. Location is great on Park and 61st, easy to walk to museums, shopping and Central Park. The room was very large and looked like it had been redone recently with high quality furnishings. The staff was very attentive and helpful. We typically stay further downtown in the East Fifties hotel area, but we paid no more for the Regency ($279 per night from their website) than we pay further downtown and the Regency is better than most of those hotels."
91,1868,"Aug 4 2005	New Year at the Regency	I stayed at the Regency Hotel in Dec 04 and stayed for the new year celebrations. The hotel is set in an excellent location, literally a couple of minutes walk from bloomingdales and a subway station. Set on park avenue, you have the bonus of having that in the city feel but with a bit of calm on the side. At xmas time bloomingdales / fifth avenue shopping areas and especially saks can be extremeley busy - people queing up at 10pm at night to get a bargain! But as you turn the corner to your hotel you feel like you can really wind down. I found the rooms to be well maintainted, modern and very luxurious. we even had a balcony overlooking the city - fab!If you are visiting new york for new year it is great! We went to times square as felt it was a must but be warned you have to be there from 4pm to even get in and they don't really provide any entertainment while you wait, just an hourly countdown! If you do not fancy times square I would recommend the rockefeller centre. They had performances by Maroon 5, Duran Duran and also guest presenters like Jay Leno. The screens in times square kept showing the rockefeller centre and I have to say, we were jealous!The regency totally relaxed me at the end of many days manic sight seeing and i would definately recommend it to anyone."
92,1868,"Jul 14 2005	Elegance on the East Side	My parent's 60th wedding anniversary was the occasion for our gathering at the Regency. We were all treated like kings, queens, princes and princesses. The service was excellent. The only slip was needing to get out room re-keyed when our keys no longer worked for some inexplicable reason. The hotel staff is very attentive and friendly, and make you feel like you belong there and are not just a visitor. Overall the hotel is rather expensive and the restaurant was very pricey, so we only had one breakfast there. There were some reasonable eateries in the area, so it wasn't too hard to keep within a budget. However, the upper east side and the Regency is not the place to stay if you are on a tight budget. It is a great place to stay for a special occasion. We were all very happy with the hotel. My parents received complimentary Mumms champagne and some sweets. The location was good for shopping, Central Park jog or walk, and close enough to 5th Ave and midtown to get there by walking or quick cab ride. My travel agent warned that the older NY hotels can be &quot;tired&quot;, but that was not at all the case with the Regency. The whole hotel was well appointed and furnished. Since we had kids, our only room choice was a double/double. The size of our room was fine for four people with two closets, a kitchette, table and chairs and an upholstered sitting chair. I got to see the rooms with a king bed, and thought they were great and plenty big for two adults (i.e. leave the kids at home). I don't think this hotel has much to offer in terms of view rooms; we looked out over some rooftops. Nonetheless, the Regency is a well known and well-respected hotel, frequented by many celebs and &quot;power&quot; people. Consider it for a classic NY experience."
93,1868,"May 24 2005	Attention deficit disorder	Maybe we got them at the wrong time, but the staff members at the Regency were not on their game when we stayed at this hotel.There were numerous times during our 5 day visit that we were not greeted upon arrival, or addressed as we left. I had to summon a cab for my family on four separate occasions. Every room on our floor had a newspaper at its door, every day. We got a newspaper at the door on two mornings. Bath robes? We lacked one, and requested it. The robe was delivered, and then retrieved the next day, without a replacement. I didn't think it was worth a $10 daily tip to get the thing back.Internet access is about $20 a day, and no one on site was able to explain the hookup protocols.The employees were kind and polite, and the majority spoke English and Spanish fluently.The room was well kept, and maid service was very good.The restaurant (&quot;The Library&quot;)serves an excellent breakfast, and the wait staff is completely attentive. The hostess provides free newspapers including foreign and domestic. (She was the most caring and competent hostess that I've EVER met in New York, in 25 years of traveling there.)I recommend the restaurant unhesitatingly. The hotel itself is a solid 3 Star Facility, and the experience does not encourage me to return. (Which is unfortunate, because we go to NYC frequently.)"
94,1868,"May 24 2005	Great location-- we never left the Upper East side.	We enjoyed the hotel and staff once our issues were ironed out at check in. We arrived at 11:30 AM and were told no clean rooms were available. We returned at 1:30 PM to be told the same thing. At 5:00 PM, we returned a third time only to be told that our room had been overbooked and that we would be moved to an inferior room that would include about a $25.00 daily rate reduction from $365.00 a day to $339. per day The manager on duty was very helpful and willing to correct our room problem when we spoke with him. He reduced our total stay to the reduced rate of $319.00/daily that we later booked as a weekend rate. He also arranged for a room upgrade since we belong to Loew's First. We spent one night in the smaller overbooked room and the remainder of the trip in a much nicer room at the lower daily rate of $319.00 per day. The room was very large for NYC. The 2 closets were perfect-- one was a walk in closet with a small safe. There are about 3 or 4 different places to sit in the room, although the bathroom had very limited space. We loved everything about the room except the 20+% rate added to the laundry bill that I was not aware of when I discussed the expense of steaming a veil and formal dress while at the hotel. Even with those two issues, the hotel is perfect for vacationers. I noticed lots of pets around the property that belonged to guests. It was cute. We would stay there again but we try to stay somewhere different each trip to the city. We have stayed at the Royalton and the Park Central back in the early 80's. Then in the mid 80's, we stayed at the Shoreham and the St. Regis Hotel. We have stayed at the Paramount, Parker Meridian and the Barbazon in the early 90's. All hotels offer something to meet the expectation for each visitor's taste. Check out this hotel or any of the others listed as well. All come highly suggested."
95,1868,"Apr 22 2005 	Excellent Location	This is a lovely old hotel right in the middle of the &quot;right&quot; part of Manhatten. When we first arrived we were given a massive 1st Floor room facing Park Avenue. After a very noisy night we were moved without hesitation to a suite on the 20th floor facing the cross street, which was much quieter.The early morning guided walk of entral Park is a lovely way to start the day, as is Breakfast in Feinsteins.If you prefer more intimate 'family' run hotels this is the one for you in NYC. If you like corporate branded sterile blandness then the W is only a few blocks away...Excellent staff, Excellent location, Excellent Value for money."
96,1868,"Mar 23 2005	the best so far	weve stayed in new york five times and so far this has been the best hotel yet. Staff are very friendly and curtious. Room service very good, clean and tidy and nice spacious rooms. would definately go back again"

98,1868,"Jan 9 2005	Wonderful as usual at the Regency	We are frequent visitors to New York City and like to stay in modern, luxury hotels that are in nice, convenient locations. Often we travel with our 14 year old daughter and our beloved 4 year old terrier, so we are looking for places that are welcoming to kids and dogs! The Regency fits the bill on all counts. Our last visit was over the Christmas holiday. We arrived on Christmas eve and stayed for three nights. We had a deluxe luxury king which turned out to be one of the largest rooms I have ever stayed in in the city. The furnishings were tasteful and classically modern, sophisticated but not cold. There were plenty of places to store clothes (and we travel with a lot), books, etc. The room had a large desk, table and small banquette, and in another area, a comfortable chair with a great reading lamp.The bathroom was not particularly large, but well appointed with plenty of counter space. It also contained a large tub and separate shower stall with European fixtures - great for us since by husband likes to bathe and I shower.Although quite full, the hotel staff couldn't have been nicer, although the service was a bit slow in the smaller library like cafe where we ate breakfast.There is also a great fitness facility at the hotel, free to guests. If that is important to you, than this one does a good job of providing many extras (yoga mats, fitness balls, etc.) that you don't get in all hotels.We have stayed here a number of times and will definitely return again."
99,1868,"Dec 14 2004	Decent but not great	Got a luxury king room with Park Ave view. The lobby was nice and intimate but the elevators were very dark and unpleasant. Staff, in general, was hospitable, particularly the housekeepers. The room was quite spacious, but i would agree with others that the bathroom was a bit too small for a luxury property. Not a stylish venue, but the location is superb. Generally speaking, average experience and value."
100,1868,"Dec 13 2004	Could do with a make-over!	For my daughters 18th, I thought a trip to New York and to top it all we would stay in a lovely hotel. I chose the Regency, Not a good move! First impression the lobby small and to be honest I thought a little glumy. Our room was dreadful it even had a disabled shower in it and a court yard view. (I was led to believe LUXURY KING was with street views). The room was not going to have our company that night so I asked for a new room. I was told the hotel was full, but I persisted and was offered another. This was an improvement but the carpet had some very bad stains and a tiny bathroom, it just looked dark and tied. The manageress (she was very sweet) and I think she knew the room was not up to scratch said she would try to find a better room for us the next day. 15 minuets later she did! So much for the hotel being full). This room was the same as the last minus the stained carpet! We had a so called kitchen only it had nothing in it except a sink, fridge 2 tea towels. no cutlery crockery not even a kettle. My other complaint was the absence of a coffee machine, surely New York 4*+ hotels can afford to offer their guests a warming beaverage after a long day out without paying after all there is no breakfast unlike most european hotels that cost the same. Overall we loved New York but not The Regency. Most of all I am upset because I told my daughter she was going to a posh hotel and I knew by her face she was disappointed. Did I also mention the carpets in all needed a good clean and the painted work brightening up."
101,1868,"Dec 5 2004	Very Pleasant Stay	My husband and I stayed at the Regency Dec 1 through 3, 2004. Our room was very nice and the staff could not have been more accomodating. We usually stay on the west side but found that this location was very convenient. We would stay here again."
102,1868,"Dec 2 2004	A wonderful Thanksgiving	Stayed at the Regency for 5 nights over Thanksgiving weekend. Had a lovely, large room, well designed and well maintained. Excellent service all around; the maid left us a hand written Thanksgiving note, housekeeping was quick with requests, and the concierge was very helpful in arranging theatre tickets and restaurant reservations. I thought the room service food was delicious, but I would note that service was slow (the hotel seemed very full over the holiday). A great location for walking everywhere. I left some personal items in the room, and realized it while at JFK waiting for my flight. I called and spoke to housekeeping and they sent someone right away to our room; the items were received by FedEx two days later. Would happily stay here again."
103,1868,"Nov 10 2004	Service nightmare	Rented suite for 890 per night-because they allow pets, we had eye irritation from the room: requested one day laundry service and no laundry returned-called that night more than once, finally at 10pm someone told me I was not going to receive-I explained I was leaving in morning-they said they would get back to me and they did not-then next day they said they sent out that morning to a dry cleaner and would not be back-spoke to manager and he assured he would fedex me clothes-clothes not yet returned-have called hotel-no one has returned my call!Room service food not goodMost irritating is how they just don't handle any issue. I used to stay here regularlyNo more"
104,1868,"Aug 30 2004	Excellent Hotel	The Regency is an excellent hotel. After spending a few nights at the Westin Times Square, the Regency was quite refreshing. We spent two nights there on the 24th and 25th of August. We originally booked a standard king room with a courtyard view, (booked through the Loews Hotels website for $199.00 per night) however, upon arriving the front desk representative asked if we would like to upgrade free of charge to a luxury king room with a street view. The room was huge and had a small kitchenette, sitting area, table and chairs and a desk area. The bathroom had a TV and a phone! It was one of the nicest hotel rooms we had ever stayed in. The staff was excellent- the concierge even called the airline to confirm our flight beofer we left for the airport. The location is great- very relaxed neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of the city, however, it is literally right around the corner from 5th and Madison Avenues. I highly recommend this hotel!"
105,1868,"Aug 12 2004	A Designer's Viewpoint	The Regency has a pristine location in the Upper Eastside, a mere 2 blocks from the southeastern corner of Central Park, two blocks from Bloomingdale's, one block from Barney's and close to the many other designer boutiques along Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue. It is convenient for being near the museums, yet removed from the midtown crush. There are quite a few world-class restaurants nearby (Aureole could be seen from my room window) as well as excellent bistros and intimate local dining spots.Specifics: I stayed in a &quot;Superior King&quot; Room. It was on the 12th floor. The Bathroom was approx. 5 by 7 and a half feet--probably small for a luxury hotel but it had very nice modern appointments. The bathroom had floor to ceiling polished Botticino marble tile and the vanity countertop was granite with a generous porcelain undermount sink with modern faucets. The tub was generous (deep and wide) and the showerhead was powerful. There was a wall to wall vanity mirror flanked by side mirrors. There was a magnifying &quot;Shaving&quot; mirror and good lighting. There was a small counter TV as well as a phone in the bathroom. Amenities included a 1600watt hairdryer, a vanity set that provided cotton balls, ear swabs, kleenex and the hotel chain toiletries which included facial (glycerine) soap, bathing soap, lotion and shower gel. The hotel provided (4) large bath SHEETS which were plump and thirsty, washcloths, hand towels, good bath mats and a large cotton bathrobe. The bathroom had convenient towel bars, hooks and a shower grab bar--very thoughtful. The only negative in my bathroom was the lack of a fan. The Hallway: had a framed, full-length mirror (great for seeing the ball gown you will be wearing to the Met!) and a lighted hall closet with shelves. The hall closet had a convenient ironing board and iron and good hangers (including padded ones for the ladies fine clothing!). The bedroom closet was kind of small--2'6&quot; X5', but it had a personal safe-- great. The main room was approximately 23 feet by 13 feet--generous for a Manhattan hotel. It featured a generous, chenille covered club chair with ottoman. There was a pedestal table with (2) upholstered arm chairs--great for eat-in room service. The bed was flanked by (2) generous nighttables with glass tops and lamps. The mattress was firm but comfortable. The bedding was white waffle-weave matelasse with scalloped border-- discreet, elegant and clean. It was made of 80% cotton, 20% poly. It looked brand new but the label had 2003 written in ink on it by magic marker. The sheets were crisp but I was unhappy with the threadcount-- which I was unable to verify. I usually accept nothing less than 400 threadcount and these felt like 250--this is my only serious bedding criticism, but one that a hotel of this standard should address. The pillows were awesome-- the hotel prides itself in giving you several options, and they were generously and attractively piled up on the bed. There was also (2) decorative Mohair neckrolls, a down comforter inside of a grey-colored fabric that I could not quite identify. This fabric was probably the one design choice I would not have made for aesthetic and other reasons. Across from the foot of the bed was a large and attractive bowfront entertainment center/armoire. This unit housed the 30&quot; Phillips TV, which had a convenient remote. There was also a mini-bar, stocked with all the usual suspects. Also provided is a goodie basket with items such as candies, bottled water, and dog biscuits--since the Regency is pet friendly. The basket items were as expensive as the mini-bar items. On the window side of the room was a wall to wall granite topped desk/executive area. This area ingeniously housed the room air conditioning unit which could be controlled by a wall thermostat. The desk area had a multi-line phone, keyboard for internet (which was interactive with the TV Screen), Regency guestbook/service guide. Best of all in this area, there was an executive swivel chair on rolling wheels with fabric upholstery. Draperies consisted of a cornice board running the width of the room with thick draperies and another set of sheer draperies. These were easily adjusted by pulling a wand and sliding the draperies along the track. The bedside also featured another multi-line phone and an alarm clock/radio. Other details: the room had crown molding and attractive carpet. The walls were covered in a wallcovering that was visually soothing-- slightly textured to appear like plaster. The artwork consisted of several black and white photographs of natural themes--flowers, trees, etc. in attractive black frames. The furniture was all rich mahoganys-- slightly masculine with stylish contemporary brass pulls. The overall color scheme was sandy tones/puce/taupe-- what I call Armani or Bergdorf Goodman colors. The overall impression was discrete, elegant and hip. Other comments- The hotel staff was friendly and professional. The hotel manager was also helpful and was always on top of things--he was actually managing. The only complaint I can think of was minor--for some reason, they were unable to make me French Toast for breakfast, even though it is on their breakfast menu.Overall, the Regency was an outstanding hotel--first class accommodations, service, and location. I have now found my home for when I come to Manhattan."
106,1868,"Aug 11 2004	Terrible service	The room was comfortable but the front desk personnel all the way up to the manager were quite rude for even the smallest things such as access to the business center (incidentally, internet access is a pay per minute use, in this day of free wi-fi access everywhere, who has heard of this?!).For the price I stayed ($250/night), the service was lacking by far. Stay at a Hilton or W instead."
107,1868,"Aug 7 2004	A very nice hotel	I had a suite, and it was subtly decorated, luxurious, very comfortable. You know it's a good hotel when your bathroom has a TV and a bidet. The bed was very comfortable, had a nice view of Park Ave. Convenient location. Great restaurants nearby. On the pricey side, but it's NY. Good CD system as well. Would definitely stay there again."
108,1868,"Jul 23 2004	Loved the Regency	July 15-19, 2004I have stayed at plenty of 4 and 5 star hotels in the past, and the Regency on Park Avenue was by far one of the best. Went to meet my mom to spend a last &quot;girls&quot; weekend together before my wedding - the hotel couldn't have been more perfect. It's prime location on Park Avenue is one street over from Madison Avenue, and 2 streets over from 5th Avenue (the heart of NYC's shopping district) made it perfect for full days of dress fittings, sale shopping, visiting museums and posh nights on the town at all the chic restraunts. (Try Park Avalon on Park Avenue for a quasi formal, intimate dinner, the Coffee Shop in Union Square for a quick bite and Giesha, right around the corner from the hotel, for Asian fusion/sushi.) The staff at the Regency couldn't have been nicer, Julian at the concierge desk was fantastic, the check-in/out was prompt, room service was pretty quick(great morning coffee)the doormen were always smiling(one even did a rendition of singin' in the rain as he handed us an umbrella when it started to rain!) The only downfalls for the hotel - walls were a little thin, carpet in the hallways need to be replaced, and don't expect to get 2 double beds because you will get 2 twins(though very comfortable - and my emphasis on very - great sheets, fluffy comforters, and air conditioning that you can run all night without getting too cold or waking up in the morning with a stuffy nose, decorated in your typical hotel art nouveau style) I booked this hotel for $180 a night (stayed for 4 nights) for my mom and I on expedia and was blown away by how great it was (location, staff, comfortability) I usually stay at the Righa Royal for close to $500 a night, but I loved the Regency and would definity stay there again (especially with bargain fares like the one I got!)"
109,1868,"Jul 18 2004	Great service great location but ordinary and overpriced food	This hotel has a great location, right on Park Avenue, near a subway, in a great shopping area, and near Central Park.On a recent stay, the staff was wonderful, the room was large and clean and quiet, though, like another reviewer, I was baffled by the housekeeper who knocked on my door at 8:45 Saturday morning to &quot;check on the room&quot;.My only major gripe: Very ordinary food at very extraordinary prices. They told me their kitchen was in the middle of renovations so their menu was restricted but I had stayed there a year and a half earlier and the food was just was bad. Since the front desk staff upgraded me to a room with a kitchenette this time, I ended up buying OJ at a nearby market, rather than paying $7 a glass from room service. There are also great restaurants in the neighbourhood, so it's easy to avoid room service."
110,1868,"Jul 17 2004	Disapointed In Canada!!!!	Hmm well for starters, my sister and i, and a friend had never been out of our hometown in canada!! so we thought it would be nice to go to N.Y!we made our reservations way in advance , for a smoking room for 3!! and with a nice view !! WELL!! when we got there we got a room with 2 single beds!! NO ash trays! and a view of crappy birck walls!! and we were made to pay for a cot for one of us to sleep on!! and it gets better!! the next afternoon when it was 97 degrees out we got stuck in there elevators for a hour!! which was not nice at all!! BUT they wanted to make it up to us so they upgraded our room to a suite on the Fifth floor ! with a beautiful view!! BUT!!!!! we were woken up 3 nights in a row at about 11:30 at night to be told that they were having complaints of the smoke !! it was NUTS!! and then to make matters worse!! when we left!! we had a $87.00 phone bill because we were charged $1.00 for all collect calls after we were told that there was only a $1.25 charge for local calls!! and there was no charge fro collect!! pretty smart aren't they!!! so to say the least we wont be staying there again!! but as for our trip in general it was great except the HOTEL!! for the money a person spends on a hotel in N.Y you shouldnt have to go through all that!! the only thing about that hotel that was good , was that the doormen were great and friendly!! so decidewisely when you pick a hotel!!Dissapointed in Canada!!!!"
111,1868,"Jul 12 2004	One of the best in NYC	I love this hotel and would stay again! As you may know, it is really hard to expect comfortably spacious rooms from the New York hotels, especially from those in Upper East or South of Central Park. But, you can find cozy, quiet, ellegant and spacious rooms from the Regency for reasonable rates!!The room was Luxury King on 2nd fl. It has a small kitchen, two walk-in closets, a marble working desk, a coffee table and a small sofa-type chair. The bed is well-decorated with ellegant pillows and a throw. Although the room is located on 2nd floor, the window is double-glass window so we could enjoy a quiet stay away from the nosies of streets. The marble bath is also well-decorated, well-prepared and spacious as well. The location is also great since Central Park is just two small bolcs away and designer boutiques on the Madison Ave are just one step away! Also, two small bolcs away from the station of yellow subway line, museum streets and upscale shoopings. Another good thing is that it seems recently renovated. I and my parents really enjoyed our stay and apparently have NO complaint about this hotel. The rate is also reasnable given this quality of stay. It is not as high as the genral rates of 4or5-diamod hotels. We paid ca. $300 per night and enjoyed more!"
112,1868,"Jul 5 2004	Regency not up to par	We stayed at the New York Regency Hotel recently. The room was very large, the bathroom very small with crumbling ceiling above the shower and black junk in the corners where the tile meets the tub. The hallways had dirty looking carpets. The location is nice on Park Avenue close to Central Park and Fifth Ave. Parking was $60. Breakfast was $110 for the five of us for bagels, juice and coffee (coffee was $5.50). There was a bug in my daughter's juice and they gave the wrong kind of bagel to my wife and daughter. For two rooms the weekend rate was $624.28 (inc taxes). We have stayed at Loew's Hotels in Coronado, CA and Montreal and they were nicer."
113,1868,"Jun 28 2004	Nice hotel	Stayed for 2 nights in a suite and the room was beautiful! Very large with lots of amenities, 1 1/2 baths, kitchenette etc. Nice quiet area, but not too far short cab rides to mid town and walking distance to subway. food was excellent in the restaurant, especially eggs benedict for breakfast, not cheap though!"
114,1868,"Jun 24 2004	Halfway between the Hilton and the Four Seasons	I spent two nights at The Regency in October, 2003 on a discounted rate of $375/night for the Premium Grand Luxury Room, 400 sq. feet, the largest room before the suites start. The room was outstanding for the price, location, and of course considering that it is New York City. Very elegant couch, chair, bed, and desk. The bathroom was above average but not more than one would expect for a 4 star hotel. The room was showing the first signs of wear but hardly diminished from the experience. The hotel is typical for New York, however, in exorbanent charges for extras such as pressing service, mini-bar, and pay-per-view movies (the worst I have encountered - $12.98). The staff was professional but hardly coridal. They exhibited New York attitude and I can understand why those guests in other reviews who encountered trouble were unimpressed with the service. Housekeeping also woke me up both Saturday and Sunday morning when they knocked while we were asleep. Before I was awake enough to shout that we were still asleep, they opened the door with a bang when it hit the chain that I had used to lock the door. Essentially, this hotel provides exactly what you pay for. It is far superior to the typical 3-star business hotels of New York City, Hilton, Sheraton, etc. but does not equal the quality of 5-star classics like the Four Seasons and St. Regis which charge upwards of $500 a night at discounted weekend rates."

1,1870,"Awesome service in an awesome location.	Right on Central Park - beautiful view of park. Service is spectacular. They didn't have the type of bagel I wanted for breakfast, so they went over to Whole Foods and bought it for me."
2,1870,"Fantastic	Excellent in all respects with the exception of the extra charge for the internet and the exorbitant charge of $16 for a bowel of cornflakes at breakfast though this did include the milk and a fruit garnish. In spite of my grumpy old man gripes the staff were great, the room comfortable and well appointed, and the breakfast great (a civilised full service meal rather than the usual buffet). The pool and gym are excellent. I am looking forward to my next stay."
3,1870,Nov 14 2009 	lobby	the lobby and the room was spectacular....with exceptional service from the multi lingual staff.
4,1870,"Oct 17 2009 	Elegant and worth every penny	Elegant and plush hotel. Tall building and I believe the lounge is on the 35th floor. Sterile entry and security approaches immediately. You can't get to the elevator unless you have a key. Nice restaurant..very unaffordable. In other words, nice but overpriced. Great views.Room was clean, decent size, floor to ceiling windows, comfortable bed and clean shower. Flat screen TV - had WebTV which I used for the first time. Helpful staff. Hotel is near Columbus Circle and attached to Time Warner Building. Many nice restaurants in the area and 24 hour Starbucks directly across the street. Hotel is a very short distance from Central Park which is great for joggers. Shopping mall is located inside Time Warner Building. Hotel is modern, plush with great views and great dining options. Staff will bend over backward to get whatever you need. Great location too &amp; very near subway station."
5,1870,"Oct 8 2009 	Wonderful View	We stayed at the mandarin oriental in New York for 3 nights in October of 2009. It was for both business and pleasure as I had a meeting but my partner just enjoyed the city. The hotel is beautiful with spectacular views. Rooms were spacious for New York and service was good but not overly intrusive. The lobby bar always had a mix of beautiful and/or rich clientele. The location was good for business and convenient for the park and midtown. It is not as convenient if you tend to like SoHo/Village attractions but still very accessible via subway. My lack of 5 stars is based on cost and value. It is a great hotel but you pay for it. If money is not tight, then it is a wonderful choice."
6,1870,"Oct 2 2009 	Great location. Picturebook NYC views.	This was our first time in NYC and we wanted a great hotel. I think we got it. I wasn't 100% happy because I've stayed at a Mandarin Oriental before (in Hong Kong), and the service and quality of room just weren't as great as the HK experience. Whilst I can accept that the different locations can explain the different amenities, an international brand like the Mandarin Oriental should really have the same level of excellent service globally.Gripe out of the way, the experience was amazing. I don't think you could ask for a better view of New York City than from the Mandarin Oriental - it was just like in the magazines and in the movies. We were on the 49th floor and had a great view of Central Park and the skyscrapers in the south easterly direction. The room was very comfortable (if a bit small, but I hear that's the norm). The bathroom felt like it could have been spruced up a bit. The concierge service was a bit hit and miss. But they tried very hard and were genuinely friendly people. Reception/front desk, however, were not very friendly and pretty snooty.The location was also great for everything - shopping (Niketown, Bloomingdales, etc. all a short walk away), theatres (about 15 minutes in a taxi) and most of all restaurants. Jean Georges is just across the road in the Trump Tower and Per Se is in the same building. The hotel is located above a shopping mall, which had some places that I was looking for (e.g., J Crew).Breakfast in the restaurant was pretty excellent, with amazing views, of course. Some city types seem to have breakfast meetings there, which adds to the atmosphere.All in all, a good place to have stayed. Yes, it was expensive, but I don't think there's any other way in NYC."
7,1870,"Sep 12 2009 	My favorite in NYC	I love MO NYC. I like the location. I lile the look. I like the feel. I love the spa. The Gentlemen's wet rooms are very seductive. Asiate's views and cuisine provide the best lunch spot in NYC. The service in all areas of the hotel is the best in US. Many of the staff are alum of my previous favorite, Four Seasons. The concierge desk works miracles. They've secured last minute tables at Per Se and Masa for us. If we want to take our nieces downtown they the latest hot spots for the fabulous people. They have even helped us get on a coveted &quot;list&quot; or two. The front desk apprears to always remeber us. We use the Centurion card and always get an upgrade, often a double upgrade. Suites 5100 and 5300 are the best unless you're in the Presidential."
8,1870,"Sep 9 2009 	one of the best if not the best in Manhattan	This is probably the freshest/ cleanest feeling luxury hotel in Manhattan. Since NYC can be so gritty we really appreciate that about the Mandarin. The service is definitely not as warm as others we have stayed at but certainly efficient. We did have a problem every day reaching the concierge from the outside, though. The rooms are very nicely appointed with some great park views for a price. We paid with Amex Plat and the hotel was not full but we were not offered an upgrade. The rooms are not huge as you are in NYC. We loved having the access to the basics of the Time Warner Center - reasonable food, bank, etc. The location is not NYC's poshest (Columbus Circle/ Lincoln Center can feel very commercial), but gives you access in all directions."
9,1870,"Aug 18 2009 	Wow awesome from check-in to check-out	Was in NYC for 1/2 marathon and stayed at Mandarin Oriental. I was definitely impressed. Booked using a Platinum AMEX which entitles you to a late check-out and room upgrade when available. Had a park view room, although the Trump building blocks some of the view it was still great.ROOMSuper comfortable bed, what it should be for 600 USD night room. Bath tub with great amenities. Nice rain shower head. Delivered complimentary ice tea to room upon check-in. Didn't use internet, but available for like 15 USD a night. Small pet peeve is these high end hotels nickle and diming on internet access.Flat screen TV with HD feed. Great audio system.Room service for breakfast delivered exactly on time as ordered!Nice desk with ample outlets for computer, phone, etc..Two bottles of Fiji Water put in room in the evening when they turn down the beds.LOCATIONAt Columbus Circle in Time Warner building. Had breakfast one morning at Bouchon Bakery on 3rd Floor. Just great! There is also a Whole Foods on ground floor with a lot of healthy options.If $$$ is not a concern go, otherwise consider it a splurge for a special occasion."
10,1870,"Aug 15 2009 	Seamless luxury with a smile	I cannot say enough about the Mandarin. The rooms were very spacious with high ceilings, a huge bathroom, floor to ceiling windows and amazing views. The king bed was massive and like sleeping on a cloud. I couldn't find fault with a single thing in the room. If I were being REALLY picky I would say that the only thing I didn't like was that you couldn't get the same channels on the television in the bathroom that you could on the TV in the bedroom. That's it. Really.After a mad day of meetings and running around New York in heels and humidity, I was so ready to shower and relax. The bathroom did not disappoint. Great bath amenities, huge rain shower head, big soft towels and a luxurious robe. Most welcome to my tired feet were the soft slippers. Ahhh. Just as I was debating whether to spoil my upcoming dinner at Asiate by eating something out of the mini-bar (I was ravenous) I hear my door bell ring and someone say &quot;In room dining, good afternoon?&quot; I don't know how, but they read my mind. The Mandarin had sent up a complimentary bento box with truffles, biscotti, mini-cookies and various other treats-- just enough to tide me over until dinner. Dinner at Asiate was out of this world. I told the waiter that I was vegetarian, and they were incredibly accommodating. They made sure to ask if I ate fish, poultry, dairy, eggs-- they made it a perfect dining experience. The food was out of this world. The risotto was spectacular, the drinks were delightfully strong and the desserts were nothing short of sinful. Couple that with spectacular views of Central Park (and the city lights, when it got dark) and you have a dinner that I won't soon forget.One of the things at the Mandarin that really impressed me was the service. Being a five star hotel, of course I expected a certain level of service. However, what impressed me was not the level of service, but the warmth of it. The gentleman who checked us in (Thomas? the name escapes me) was so very personable and warm. You really got the feeling that he enjoyed his job and was truly pleased to be welcoming you to his hotel. Any employee I came across had a genuine smile for me and a greeting. I stayed at a number of different hotels during my week in New York, and the service at the Mandarin was hands-down the most personable, which surprised me."
11,1870,"Aug 1 2009 	Fantastic Hotel Business District	I have stayed a number of times at the Mandarin in New York for business (last visit Nov 2008).Located in the 35th floor and up of a tower in Columbus Circle, the hotel is right by Central Park and offers amazing views on the park and the Hudson river, as well as the city (even the lowest rooms start on the 37th floor).Rooms are spacious and well designed, with an Asian touch. Some are a little dated, but very well maintained.The hotel has all amenities of a truly 5 star hotel with the service that goes with it. Both restaurants are very good, you can have a light bite at the bar area or a proper dining experience at their michelin star restaurant, both displaying incredible views over the city.The spa is great, large choice of treatments, and has a jaccuzzi/sauna/steam room. The pool is a good 20m long if not more and the gym is excellent filled with modern equipment.Finally, the business center is open all night and has everything you need which is helpful and saved me a few times.This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Price is aligned with the hotel category, but definitely not a rip-off, they earn every cent they charge you for.The only negative is the area if you're coming on a leisure trip. I've also stayed downtown which is a more pleasant neighbourhood. It's not bad per se (you have the park, museums, shopping etc) but most people around the hotel are there to work, and I felt that the scene doesn't give you the feeling of what living in New York is like. I'm posting a review on the Soho Grand Hotel soon, which is a good place if you're looking for a holiday.Otherwise for business, I wouldn't go anywhere else."
12,1870,"Jul 25 2009 	Mandarin measures up	Just couldn't bring myself to give this hotel a 5 star rating. We never got 2 robes in our suite, regardless of the request. On 2 mornings, the steak and eggs resulted in the meat being well beyond the ordered temperature. The contemporary decor suite with floor to ceiling windows meant the suite had stunning views, but it was only moderate in size. The extra half bath, although poorly lit, is always a welcome amenity. Loved the 'Fresh' bath products and the rain shower.A great urban spa. The men's facilities were first rate.The decor is a bit cold, but that's what you get with this sophisticated minimalist approach. I'm not a fan of Dale Chihuly glass sculpture, so those touches in the public spaces detract from the 'look' in my book.I would stay again."
13,1870,"Jul 21 2009 	One of the Best Hotels Great Views Amazing Spa Superb Location and Dining	Great hotels in NY are not cheap. The Mandarin is a great location... On Central Park, Near Midtown, but not as crazy as Times Square. I did a mixed business and leisure trip here for 3 days. Hotel service was superb. Asiate restaurant is tops in the entire City according to Zagat for best views and decor... and it is. Here are some more highlights:* Rooms: Grade: A... Nice, newer, great bathrooms. Had a Hudson River view, Central Park is nicer, but Hudson View from corner rooms was great for us. Surprisingly, our upgraded corner room did not have two sinks in bathroom. If important to you, be sure to ask. Shower was great. I've had NYC rooms that were the size of a coat closet, the king room here was very comfortable. * Mini-Bar: A. In NY, if you want a Diet Coke or a quick snack, I do not know how people survive without a nice mini-bar. They had a great mini-bar with water and drinks. Expensive, yes, BUT THIS IS NY! Many hotels are removing mini-bars, but they are a salvation if you want a Diet Coke or Snack at an odd time.* Spa: A++... Definitely one of the best urban spas anywhere. Great hot tub/pool, steam room, etc. Not cheap, but worth every penny for a massage or other service.* Lobby: A... On the 35th floor, nice lounge area, clean and open space. Good lobby bar with great views. * Concierge: A... arranged all kinds of stuff for us. Friendly and efficient.* Room Service: A-... Generally great. Food and service were excellent. * Asiate: A... Great food, the best view around. Brunch was VERY reasonable. Good wines too. * Lobby Bar food: B+... A friend of mine ate lunch at the lobby bar. He said most of it was good, but some items got cold. Lobby bar is next to Asiate, but they probably do not share a kitchen. His sense was this food came from a kitchen much further and not Asiate. His review of the lukewarm food was the only real criticism we could find at this hotel. * Location: A+... one of the best. * Service: A... great overall. Not over the top, there when you need them. Front desk was busy sometimes, but overall they seem to have a good full staff everywhere. Doorman and concierge helped solve lots of issues. * Other: A+... Hotels are expensive. If you are busy, you need lots of little things taken car of... they had a hotel shuttle take us to a play when we were rushed and booked a great ride to the airport in an Audi A8. Can't say enough about the small stuff. This hotel had a LOT of international guests from Europe and Asia. There were a few groups of loud young twentysomethings on some sort of group party who made a bit of noise, but otherwise this is a great, quiet, professional-focused hotel. Great business hotel and a great leisure hotel if you want to be near Central Park and/or have a great spa. We will return to this hotel again soon. The Mandarin can go head-to-head with the Ritz or Four Seasons and it a bit more modern than the Ritz."
14,1870,"Jul 18 2009 	Mandarin Oriental - Excellent 5-Star Treatment	My spouse and I have always afforded at least 1, truly, luxury vacation per year (Maui, HI; Singapore, Jamaica, Mexico, Bahamas, Florida, Vegas, Tahoe. The experience offered by the Mandarin Oriental has topped all the vacations that we have ever taken. The staff was genuinely friendly and exceptional to service. The views from our room and lobby of the Hudson River and Central Park were spectacular. The hotel is located within an easy and entertaining walking distance to everything Manhattan. The subway entrance is just off the corner in Columbus Circle. The entry to the hotel was also very pleasing as it away from the hustle and bustle of Columbus Circle and the many hotels on Broadway, Park and 5th Avenue venues. From the door-staff to direct you to the elevators for the 35th floor lobby, to the reception/check-in, room service, privacy service; everything about this hotel was geared to great and sincere personal service. Prior to booking, I read a few reviews complaining of the noisy Hudson River side of the hotel. We requested the Hudson River side for the views and found no disturbing noise whatsoever, and our room was directly across from the ice-machine and service elevator room. We were on the 51st floor and could hear a faint siren squawk every now and then, but then we were in the largest city in the U.S; I hear more sirens living in Dallas, TX. And, let me mention that we slept like babies; the bed and linens are luxurious, the hairdryer was a real one and not attached to the wall, the spa soaps and lotions divine - I'm very picky/sensitive skin and usually don't bother with these complimentary items, but put some on my tired feet and immediately notice the high quality of the products. Also, superior compliments to room service; we found ourselves in our room each late afternoon to rest and rejuvenate before going back out again in the evening; every afternoon a plate or basket of delicious snacks were waiting our arrival (nuts, garnished popcorn, candied fruits, fresh fruits, chocolates, etc.) - a nice touch to go with our cocktail, which I ordered through room service every late afternoon and here is the point - it arrived quickly, not 30 minutes after ordering, but within minutes. Same with our breakfast room service that we did not pre-order the night before. Room Service within minutes with fine linens, cutlery and china. The coffee, Illy, is one of my favorites. The room-service phone staff was courteous and could actually talk and listen; never seeming impatient or hurried. Exceptional Hotel and one worth spending the money on."
15,1870,"Jun 30 2009 	What a fabulous Spa	Had a spa day at and it was incredible!! The service, the treatment, the spa facilities....could imagine a better way to spend Sunday!!!!"
16,1870,"Jun 8 2009 	Very zen but not functional	It is all very well to put lotus flowers on your plates but if the room (overpriced!) is not functional, I'd rather not have them. There is not nearly enough cupboard and drawer space, the sofa has no backrest so you cannot sit on it and read and there is only one chair. Most disappointing though is the lobby - nowhere to sit and rest except if you are prepared to have a snack or drink. Impossible to pour the tea without spilling some of it. On the positive side, we found the staff very friendly and helpful (especially the concierge) and the room on the Central Park side was very quiet. A good mark also for the bathroom with its enclosed shower. Contrary to other Mandarin Oriental Hotels (e.g. Geneva) I would not give this one a top rating and would rather go to a more functional yet cozy place."
17,1870,"Jun 1 2009 	Mandarin in the Midst	The Mandarin NYC is in the midst of it all in midtown Manhattan. It's also &quot;in the mist.&quot; Let me explain: while on business in NY, I spent several days at the Mandarin--including Saturday and Sunday rehearsals for an early Monday morning pitch. With some downtime, I was able to explore all the great restaurants in the Time Warner Center (Thomas Keller's place) and nearby restaurants (Jean George). But what was really a treat about the Mandarin--here comes the &quot;mist&quot; part--is the spa. I was able to spend 80 luxurious minutes in the MO spa--including some quality time in the mist in the amethyst steam room. I was then massaged until completely relaxed and ready for the pitch on Monday. So, at the Mandarin, you can be both in the midst and in the mist...doesn't get any better than that."
18,1870,"May 24 2009 	Simply the Best !	We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for 2 nights from May 8th 09, this is simply the best hotel experience you can imagine, words alone cannot explain our sheet delight with the standards of this hotel, the attentive and superbly professional staff and the amazing location just across from Central Park on the Columbus Circle. Book this hotel and you will not be disappointed, we will be back before long!"
19,1870,"May 2 2009 	Shangri-La	From the moment I stepped out of the cab on Friday afternoon the Mandarin staff made me feel like I was in Shangri-La!! The Suite was magnificent and the view beyond compare. All my special requirements were in place and continued to be so for my entire visit. Everyone at the Mandarin made me feel like one of the family. The Doormen, Concierge Staff, Housekeeping, Front Desk, Lounge and Bar staff....all made me feel like a Queen!!! It doesn't get any better than that! Dealing with the Media can be a stressful one but all my meetings at the Mandarin went off without a hitch and were extremely successful! For some Network executives it was the first time they had been at the hotel and were very impressed, relaxed and happy!! That's what the Mandarin does for people....it's like an Oasis in the desert!! It puts a smile on people's faces and you can see instant relaxation overcome them.I can't wait to return! No one does it better than the Mandarin!!"
20,1870,"Apr 9 2009 	One great hotel	This was my third trip back to the Mandarin Oriental New York. Stunning views of Central Park , great location and an excellent staff will keep me coming back!"
21,1870,"Apr 8 2009 	Stunning views great location wonderful service	We stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary, leaving the children at home. The hotel put us on the top floor in a premium park view suite, at a very reasonable rate. The day we arrived they gave us complimentary champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries (a personal favourite) which was a lovely touch. The suite was lovely with a far better than average bathroom for a NY hotel (where baths are usually like large sinks)The hotel staff were of the highest quality in every department, with service levels I haven't experienced in any other NY hotel. The spa was great, though expensive. The location on Columbus Circle cannot be bettered in my opinion.The food was disappointing in comparison to other Mandarin Oriental hotels. Room service was OK but not great. The lobby lounge was again OK, not great. Choice of lunch and dinner dishes in both were limited (though breakfast was excellent as always in NY)I didnt find Asiate innovative, or inspiring, but really rather boring (we had the tasting menu). If you've been to the Fat Duck or similar in Europe this restaurant will be a disappointment. It has the NY tendency (just like its neighbour Per Se) to be over elaborate in the preparation of food without really achieving anything remarkable. And at present they are all obsessed with the provenance of the ingredients - I don't really care where the mushroom comes from or how it is grown if it tastes bland....The next day I couldnt remember what I'd eaten at all. On the bright side, the room was spectacular (the &quot;wall of wine&quot; is particularly impressive).I will stay here again - for the rooms, service and location. But will probably eat outside the hotel."
22,1870,"Apr 3 2009 	Exceptional Service	Visited the MO bar for a quiet drink and dinner. Fernando was our waiter and performed exceptional customer service. My colleague requested an item that was not on the menu and Fernando immediately offered to check with the Chef and indicated it would not be a problem. The timing, quality and professionalism of the staff in the bar were memorable. I am also in the Hospitality Industry and like to acknowledge great service.Thank you Fernando."
23,1870,"Mar 9 2009 	The best hotel in NYC	I love the Mandarin NYC. If I could afford to live here, I would. The service, the rooms, the spa, the workout facilities: the whole place is phenomenal. My room service meal was one of the better meals I have had in my life. The staff is amazing, kind, and helpful. The only downside is the price, but you get what you pay for."
24,1870,"Feb 6 2009 	Great - Espensive -worth it in these times?	Great hotel - very expensive - is it worth it in these times!? Paid almost $3,000 per night for 1 suite &amp; 1 connected room - great accomodations. Everything about the hotel is great - wonderful view (GWB from 1 room, Central Park sideways from another), everything was perfect. All employees are extremely accomodating, couldn'nt ask for more. Also great location - Columbus Circle at the lower west end of Central Park - can't beat that! Went there for my stepdaughters birthday - she loved the pool (didn't like the fact that spas/whilpools are unisex!),had a birthday cake there when we checked in. All in all a great time, but ?$$$ (but we are in NYC) . If you really want to celebrate, why not!? Do it!!!!"
25,1870,"Feb 3 2009 	Flawless!	We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for my birthday weekend at the end of January and it was beyond perfect, it was magical! Luxury hotels tend to feel stuffy and old, whereas the Mandarin Oriental was modern, and warm. The Asian influence is everywhere, but always tasteful and never overdone. What I liked most about the hotel and the suite was how comfortable I felt everywhere. From check-in to check-out, I was always made to feel like a king.The 35th Floor Lobby is exquisite. The Front Desk staff was friendly, accommodating, and genuine. There was nothing scripted or fake about anyone I came in contact with (something I find to be obnoxious at other hotels). The one bedroom, one and half bathroom suite was stunning. The bedroom was exceptionally large and the 2 closets were impressively spacious. Next to the large picture window was a beautiful chaise. The bed was very comfortable and when we asked for non-down bedding, it was brought in an instant. The main bathroom was humongous! It was as long as the room. I loved how it flanked the bed (there was a door on each side of the bed). The rain showerhead and Fresh products were lovely as was the soaking tub, his and her sinks, and swiveling TV.Ive lived in New York City all my life, but standing at the floor-to-ceiling windows, on the 53rd floor, with unbelievable views of the Hudson River, Central Park, and Columbus Circle renewed my love for this city  I could only imagine how awed out-of-towners must be.Dinner at Asiate was an event. We sat at one of the window seats overlooking the park and had a beautiful view as we ate our impressive dinner. This restaurant deserves much more attention than it receives. The service was impeccable and the food was out of this world (Im still dreaming about the lobster and risotto dishes). The Lobby Lounge was equally as impressive, but obviously with a more casual feel. Ill always be apprehensive about paying more than $15 for a cocktail, but that apprehension disappeared after the first sip of my beautifully crafted Baby Buddha.Overall, I think Mandarin Oriental is the best hotel in New York. Its different. In a very, very good way."
26,1870,"Jan 22 2009	Pure Luxury!	Don't usually stay in hotels like this, but so glad I did this time! Fab central location, great views, everything in our room was top quality and nothing was too much trouble for any of the charming staff. Spa facilities top notch, although treatments are a bit pricey. Swimming pool and sauna great and lovely products for use in changing rooms.Looking forward to my next visit already!"
27,1870,"Jan 8 2009 	Perfect Honeymoon Hotel	We stayed at the Mandarin from 15  20 September for our honeymoon and it was absolutely amazing. We booked on the Internet Rate and paid $815 dollars/night plus taxes. On arrival the receptionist upgraded us from a Grand Deluxe Double room on the 40th floor (their website says these rooms are on floors 43-54 so not sure if she was downgrading us!) to a Premier Hudson River View room on the 53rd floor. Our room was amazing, exactly as the pictures depict on their website, spotlessly clean, well appointed and with fantastic views of the city and the River Hudson. The bed was super comfy. Excellent sound system, didnt really use the TV so cant comment on choice of channels. Wed only been in our room 30 minutes when complimentary champagne and chocolate cake arrived, both were delicious. Housekeeping and turndown service was excellent. We ordered room service a couple of times and it was exceptional. Breakfast in our room was more than adequate but didnt think it was up to the usual Mandarin standard. We didnt have much need to use the concierge but when we did they were very helpful and efficient. The bellmen/doormen were all very friendly. We didnt have time to eat in Asiate but wish we had. We had cocktails and mini burgers (not together!) in the Lobby Lounge, the burgers were great. Hotel location was excellent for us, in a quietish area on the edge of central park but only about a 10 minute walk to Times Square. Its very much a business hotel so some people may feel its a bit clinical, but all the staff were great and we loved it."
28,1870,"Nov 22 2008 	Tried very hard to like this place	On previous trips while staying at another 5 star property in town, I kept finding myself at The Time Warner center for dinner, drinks, walks in the park etc. Therefore , I thought, why not try it out?While there were no disasters, and nothing particularly bad about the hotel, it came across as dissapointigly average. The park views were terrific. The service was friendly. But the overall experience feels more like a convention Hyatt. There's nothing wrong with that, but its very dissapointing if you are expecting a five star experience. That fifth star is all in the details, and thats what the hotel lacks. From the service, to the finishes in the rooms. Most of the problems come from the building itself. Even though the hotel is only a couple hundred rooms, you definitely feel like you're in a massive structure. And everything, from the spa to the business center feels like its miles away, down random corridors. For example, the entrance to the gym is located just outside a ballroom area: so at best, you have to walk through a dark empty banquet area with a piano covered in the corner, but I couldn't help thinking of the alternative if the room were in use, which would be making your way through a black tie affair in your sweaty workout clothes. One afternoon I returned to my room to find the maid cleaning the room, but noticed she had the TV turned on and was watching a soap opera. Little things like this give the impression there is very little oversight of the smaller details by management. The area rug in the lobby has an ugly rubber band around it like an airport would have, and the tile and fixtures in the bathrooms, while attractive, look cheap and institutional. The rooms have an office-chic feel to them, like a first class airport lounge. Nothing wrong with that, but certainly not the height of luxury one might expect."
29,1870,"Nov 19 2008 	The best in NYC	Second stay at the Mandarin Oriental. First stay was in a Central Park view suite. This time in a Central Park deluxe room. everything remains excellent with excellent amenities.Actually, this is certainly the best hotel in New York from the bellmen staff to the spa, the restaurants, the concierge and even the whole security. Yes, it has a cost and location is not the best, but it worth the value."
30,1870,"Nov 15 2008 	Service with a snarl	Date: November 14, 2008I have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in New York previously and had a pleasant stay. This time, however, is typified by the attitude of the Maitre D at the cocktail lounge. We asked for seats and were told, with an arrogant and superior demeanor, that it would be a twenty to twenty-five minute wait. This despite many tables being obviously vacant. We were told we could wait at the bar, which we did. Thirty minutes later the Maitre D having never come for us, I approached him again and was told I would still have to wait. Again, many tables were open. Finally an hour later, after never having heard from the Maitre D, we left. We noted again that most of the tables in the lounge were still vacant. The attitude of the staff was that we were lucky to be there. With these prices and the economy what it is, if they continue with this attitude it is they who will be lucky to be there."
31,1870,Oct 17 2008 	Nice views but off centre	The hotel offers the usual Mandarin Oriental high standards found throughout this chain but in addition it offers wonderful views across Central Park (albeit they are not uninterupted!). Didnt manage to make breakfast. Rooms service was good although clearing trays from the room took hours. What was uncomfortable about the hotel is the distance from 5th Avenue. Yes you are closer to the theatres and you have shopping &amp; dining options downstairs (the hotel is on the higher levels of a Columbus Circle building) but its a stroll to 5th &amp; a stroll back with shopping bags. The Ritz and Plaza beat it for location though. The bar is though a great place to meet &amp; enjoy the views. What is also unusual is that the hotel 'starts' with its lobby on the 35th floor.
32,1870,"Sep 30 2008 	Simply the Best in the city	This is first review that I have written for any of the hotels in the city. As I wonder why I haven't, the only answer I can come up with is that none of the other &quot;houses&quot; excited me enough to spend the time writing about it. These include the Marquis, Waldorf, Michelangelo and the Trump. All of them &quot;ok&quot; but there was always something not quite right.The Mandarin is epitome of luxury. The staff, the rooms, you name it; I have nothing but positive comments.We booked the premier park view suite and were very happy with its size and view (there was some obstruction from the Trump next door, but hey, its New York City). We also, booked the Spa VIP Suite on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Oh my God! If you have a couple of grand in your pocket and would like to spoil your partner, this is the way!Every night when we left the hotel for dinner the hotel car was available (although I realize this was just luck with the timing). We will stay here on the next trip and probably will try some of the other Mandarin properties.Ok, one negative! The bar was closed when we came back to the hotel at 12:15 after dinner. However, that was a nightcap that I really did not need anyway!"
33,1870,"Sep 30 2008 	So-so hotel	I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental New York for five nights. Yes, it's a pretty hotel with a nice location. The spa is good but terribly expensive. I was disappointed with the service. Every morning room service got my breakfast order wrong. And it was a new mistake every morning. Quite annoying having to wait for them to get the order right - every day! At least they got my dinners right. Several times when I called housekeeping to ask for something to be delivered or done in the room, they forget or made a mistake and brought the wrong things. On several occasions the concierge forgot to call me back or to find out things for me. They also provided me with addresses to several shops, but did not provide a map, or the side street, or the opening hours. And I had to help them find out several things which should have been easy. All in all, the hotel does not provide the type of service one would and should expect from a five-star and very expensive hotel."
34,1870,"Sep 27 2008 	Not worth the price	Stayed 1 night at the mandarin oriental in a Central Park view room. Was really looking forward to this stay as it was the most expensive hotel room we've ever stayed in ($1279 per night), so expectations were high. Prior to staying at the MO we had already stayed 6 nights in NYC in a mid priced hotel around the corner so this was our treat. To be honest I was a bit dissapointed. Yes the room was overlooking central park but a good proportion of the view was obliterated by the Trump tower which has been built right in front of the Times Warner centre (where the MO is housed on the top floors). We had also already seen the view of Central Park from the Top of the Rock so had already 'spoiled' it for ourselves - probably should have booked the room for our first and not last night in NYC. Room was nicely furnished but did not surpass any other 5 star property where you pay much less for a room. TV was infuriatingly difficult to operate if you wanted to browse the 100 or so channels. Breakfast at Asiate was divine - great service &amp; food and highly recommended. Check in service helpful, efficient &amp; friendly and as professional as you would expect for a hotel of this calibre. Hotel was more suited to business people not so much tourists and didn't have much of a holiday atmosphere. Did not use the spa or pool/fitness centre. Great shops &amp; dining options in the Time Warner building."
35,1870,Sep 26 2008 	Simply Lovely	Stayed here for New Years and had an amazingly romantic stay. Booked a room with a tub with view of city. I am not into taking baths but with that view and room service of some champagne and chocolate covered strawberries was worth it. The pool room is nothing exciting but the spa is def worth visiting. I had the massage which was ok but the best part of the spa experience was steam room and lounge which has amazing views of the park and city. The bed was soooo comfortable. Of course the rooms are on the smaller side but thats what you get for nyc. But even though the room was small it had everything you would need from a top hotel. If you are visiting nyc the location is great especially during the holidays. The hotel restaurants and bar are worth going to as well.
36,1870,"Sep 6 2008 	Disappointed	I chose this hotel based on recommendations from this site. Either I'm just hard to please or I had really bad luck with this experience. I booked a wkd trip with my mom in a suite - we were in town to see an oncologist for my mom. Having frequented many other hotels globally, luxury and otherwise, I was very disappointed. The door staff, who represent first and last impressions was terrible and didn't even come close to a mid-level hotel, let alone other 5-star hotels like a Four Seasons or a Ritz. On multiple occasions, they ignored us because they were too busy socializing with each other, doing blackberry(unbelievable!), or favoring other guests. We took many cabs and only once did we get assistance after we asked the doorman (this is after we tried hailing our own cab without any success right in front of him) - the doorman who was too busy doing his blackberry/phone and made us feel like we were rude for interrupting him. Doorman only held open door sometimes, seemed like only if he felt like it - it didn't matter if we had our luggage or not, it was very inconsistent. After being promised checkin to our room 30 min after we arrived, we took a 2 hr lunch and were surprised when they said that our room still was not ready when we returned - yes we were a few hours early but don't tell us it will be ready earlier if it won't be! This was not the welcome we needed especially due to my mom's fatigue. At least they treated us to a drink in the bar - but still all my mom wanted to do was rest. I was left on hold one night after asking concierge for some info - he forgot about me and I had to call back to get assistance from someone else. Upon leaving, we asked for an address and phone number to a Fifth Avenue store - the concierge gave us the wrong information (the address didn't exist and the number was for the corporate office, not the retail store). We ended up getting lost and I had to call my husband who was back home for navigation assistance - we ended up having to walk quite a distance to find the store (again, not good when my mother is ill) and had to rush our purchases before making it to the airport on time. If the conceirge could not find the info, he could have at least told us that rather than give us some bogus address on Fifth Avenue that did not even exist. The hotel did try to compensate for some of the bad service by not charging us for any balance of our breakfasts that our package did not include. But even that wasn't communicated very well and different messages were communicated by different people. I liked that the spa amenities were included in the suite rate - the steam room was good. But I've been to nicer spas. Location is good. The room was nice and I loved the bedside reading books and supply of Fiji water. The view from Asiate was beautiful. I was surprised that a newspaper was not included and the spa certificate was pretty much useless. I travel alot for business and have been to other hotels in NYC and I would not return to this hotel. This was my first Mandarin Oriental hotel stay - I had always preferred Peninsula for a luxury hotel with Asian flare. I didn't choose to stay there this time because their spa/gym was being renovated. Overall, I was extremely disappointed in this stay on many fronts. I could have stayed at the Sheraton and would have gotten better service!"
37,1870,"Sep 1 2008 	Mandarin New York  A Great Experience	Just few words to say and rate our great experience at the Mandarin Oriental New York. Have been there for a couple of nights at the end of July 2008. Booked a simply superior room with a main Hudson view. The room was not huge but very nice with a lot of useful tech advantages and features. The bed was very comfortable despite of some really soft pillows. Bathroom perfect in size and very nice. Service absolutely fantastic, very nice view also if it not was not a Central Park room view. Enjoy a wonderful breakast ( also if is the service it was a little bit too slow ) at the Asiate Resturant. Unfortunately did not use the Spa or other services. So , one if the not the best hotel in New York right now , also if it was expensive. I really like new and High Tech hotel and this Mandarin it was in my opinion a true perfect layout . Additional to this , check in and check out were perfect and very quick , as well room service . Bravo Mandarin !"
38,1870,"Aug 19 2008 	Engagement	Last weekend, I proposed to my girlfriend and we stayed two nights at the Mandarin Oriental. This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in New York. We received a complimentary upgrade and all the staff were absolutely perfect. I was considering other hotels where I have previously stayed including the Four Seasons, Waldorf Astoria, the Meridien, the Hudson or Alex and am absolutely delighted to have decided on the Mandarin Oriental. It is expensive but they do have special weekend offers and for such an occasion really lived up to expectations. I could not fault the hotel or staff in any way as it made this day very special. I think we will be coming back here for our important anniversaries. Absolutely worth spending a bit more to stay in a very special place with magnificient views and bedrooms, complete peace of mind in a relaxing setting and get what is probably the best service in New York."
39,1870,"Aug 11 2008 	Fantastic hotel!	Mandarin Oriental NYC is a fantastic hotel. We stayed in an executive suite facing the Hudson river (view from the living room) but we still had a view of Central Park from the Bedroom/Bathroom.The suite has a tremendous woaw factor, this is the best city suite we ever tried, even if not the biggest. However please note that service is not at the same level as it is at Oriental Bangkok (flagship of MO group). Small details have to be improved (butter was missing at breakfast once, trash can was not emptied every time at night service). Fortunately these small issues did not tarnish our experience.We used the Concierge services many times:- magical private helicopter ride booked through him with Helicopter Flight Services, Inc.,- reservation of one of the best table at Del Frisco's Steakhouse on 6th avenue,- transfer with limousine from/to the airport (205 USD from JFK and 180 USD to JFK =&gt; nice and helpful chauffeurs knowing the city to avoid traffic),- etc.We also tried the swimming pool &amp; the Spa (on 36th floor). Therapists were smiling, very professional. Use of the VIP Spa suite is delightful. It allows you to enjoy time in your private steam and bath, finishing with a light dinner. You feel completely taken away from the city bustle. Regarding the location everything has already been said. You have direct access to the shops at Columbus Circle (with Whole Foods Market at the basement where you can have lunch/dinner at a fair price until 11pm). Many subway lines stop at Columbus. AMC Loews Cinema with IMAX is 15 minutes away (by walking), just like boutiques on 5th avenue and Times Square."
40,1870,"Aug 3 2008 	#45??	OK, so how is this hotel the 45th best hotel in NYC? You can argue over what is #1 and the Mandarin Oriental will always be in that conversation.The staff is impecable and attentive. I had lost some luggage on the flight from LAX and the concierge made sure American had it and got it to me promptly, I didn't need to do a thing.My room had an amazing view of Central Park and the meal at Asiate is as good as I have had in NY. YES, the property is pricey, but what in Manhattan isn't?For a business trip, especially on business with Time Warner, this place is hard to beat."
41,1870,"Jul 28 2008 	Wonderful Anniversary Stay	Just stayed at the Manadarin this past weekend. We celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary and the staff at the hotel created an exceptional expericance. From the moment we were greeted by the doorman to the moment he said goodbye on our last day, we were catered to as royalty. The staff was pleasent. caring and very accomadating. the location is the best in Manhattan, the hotel was beautifull. Very well organized , situated and very classy. The rooms were fabulous, we stayed in the Hudson River View room,, everything from bathroom, bedding to view was perfect, just like images on theweb site. The Lobby Bar was a great relaxing spot after our dinner &amp; theatre evening.All staff were excellent and the class &amp; service was the tops."
42,1870,"Jul 27 2008 	Truly the best hotel in NYC.	I've stayed at many luxury hotels both in NYC and around the world including the luxury masterpiece &quot;Burj Al Arab&quot; in Dubai.The Mandarin Oriental is superb. Above and beyond style and accessibility, the most important factor in considering the rating of a property is SERVICE.The service at the Mandarin is Superb. One of the best only rivaled by my time spent at the Four Seasons.If you're going to NYC, do NYC right, and stay at the Mandarin, where your every whim is addressed and you can focus on only your task at hand whether it be pure pleasure or business."
43,1870,Jul 25 2008 	'unobstructed' CP views?????	Had a great stay at the Mandarin Oriental... but might prefer the Trump Towers next time.... Why? Because I like an unobstructed view and Trump Towers obstructed the CP view big time... so I prefer to be on the first row next time. Sure the Mandarin Oriental is a 5-star... but somewhat overpriced.
44,1870,"Jul 24 2008 	Best Hotel in New York so far	My husband and I have been trying out various hotels in Manhattan in order to find the perfect one for us. So far this is the best. It has the views of the Four Seasons and the service of the Saint Regis all rolled into one. We booked a Central Park suite and were not disappointed. The bedroom can be completely shut off from the living room so that it's very dark and quiet. I slept better there than in my own home. The bathroom is quite large with double vanity sinks, private toilet room and large soaking tub. It also has a nice shower. There is also a powder room in the entrance foyer for guests. It happened to be nearly 100 degrees every day that we were there so it was nice to have the indoor shopping center on the first three floors of the Time Warner building without having to go outside. We also ate dinner at Asiate and it was fantastic. Room service was impeccable and we didn't have to send the waiter back for any forgotten items - a first. There are plasmas in the living room and bedroom as well. The staff is extremely friendly."
45,1870,"Jul 23 2008 	FANtastic stay	My husband and I stayed here for 3 nts for my birthday. It was worth every penny! From the moment we arrived, until the moment we left, everything was wonderful!The hotel not only upgraded us to a Hudson River View Room, but they had a cake &amp; a bottle of champagne waiting for us for my bday. Since we don't drink, we thanked the bellboy &amp; sent the champagne back. He came back 10 minutes later with a tray full of fruit and extra bottled water! The service was excellent! Everyone who worked in the hotel was gracious and hospitable, and always had a smile on their faces. The decor was beautiful and the views from the hotel, stunning. The room itself was well laid out and had great views. I loved their rainshower head! I had a facial &amp; a massage at the spa. Although it was very expensive (more than most places I've been), the services were excellent. I don't think I've had such a great massage in a very long time! We had dessert &amp; coffee in their lobby bar one night. Not only were the desserts great, but the view (esp. at night) was great!The location is good. You could walk pretty much anywhere midtown. Anywhere else, you would need a cab. Also, since they had shops &amp; restaurants right below the hotel (Shops at Columbus Circle), it was very convenient to grab coffee or snacks, or even a meal.All in all, this was a great hotel and I would definetely go back in a heartbeat."
46,1870,"Jul 14 2008 	21st Birthday blowout!	I went here in October im sure the service hasnt changed, but i have to say this hotel is stunning. We booked through Quintessentially/Carrier who made our stay perfect. Our room was styled to perfection. I love modern hotels, and with our limestone bathroom with rainfall shower and huge bed it was uber luxurious for my long weekend.The room was well equipped with a tantalising mini bar stacked with goodies like jelly beans, and the room service breakfast was quick though a little expensive was delicious. (I had the pancakes)Also on my birthday they brought up a tray of goodies like chocolate dipped strawberries and other goodies, it was the small details that made my trip memorable.We used their concierge, and they recommended some great places for food, all the staff from the door men to the reception were charming and helpful. We also dined in Asiate, all i can say is WOW! we feasted on asian style lobster and chocolate fondant (i still dream about that dessert) Pricey yes, but it was fusion at its best and the views are not to be missed, and again they gave me a little birthday cake creation.All in all, a true 5 star hotel. For a weekend of luxury, i would stay at the MO again."
47,1870,"Jun 25 2008 	Excellent experience Overall.	I stayed at this hotel to try this hotel out. The indoor pool is a great size. The gym is a little on the small side, but well equipt. The service since I arrived has been amazing. The hotel is spotless and clean. The staff is excellent. The spa treatments I received were good, but not great. Hotel spas are always super expensive, but thought I would try a facial and a massage. The massage is great and the facial was a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. The best waiting area and spa water ever. The room was very small with too many chairs. I had to take the extra chairs out of my room. The bathroom was very nice and the shower was excellent. The room overall, besides the over crowding of the furniture, excellent and clean. The bed was comfortable, and the sheets were very soft. If you are lucky, you will see a couple of famous faces in the lobby. The food was good. I would stay again."

My husband and I stayed there for a night after my grad school graduation and were completely blown away by the immaculate facilities, incredible location, and over-the-top friendly and attentive customer service. Each and every staff member you meet at the Mandarin Oriental have a genuine smile on their faces. The location of this hotel can NOT be beat for a visit to the city. I lived in New York City for three years, worked there for 5, and still hang out in the city several times a month. Columbus Circle, the Mandarin's location, is where you want to be if you are a tourist or a native New Yorker looking for an amazing stay. You are right at the hub of all the major subway lines, a short walk downtown to Times Square, 5th Ave Shopping, Museum of Modern Art, and a short walk uptown to Lincoln Center, Tavern on the Green, and the delicious restaurants of the Upper West Side. There is a bit less of the hustle and bustle of other midtown hotels located in the 30s and 40s (streets). Our room had the most spectacular view of central park and the upper west side - all rooms have views as the hotel lobby starts on the 35th floor.Go to the Mandarin if you can splurge!"
49,1870,"Jun 21 2008 	Loved It!	After much deliberation, I booked this hotel for my husband and I for a 5 day stay.It left me torn between this and the Four Seasons. I enjoyed the decor and ambience of the Mandarin so much. Views were incredible. We were in a Hudson River view room and it was lovely. The washroom met and exceeded my expectations and this was my biggest concern after staying at the Four Seasons. Truly everything about the room was perfect and I cannot fault. From the cleaning, to turn down, I loved coming back to it and enjoyed being in it which is saying a lot for a hotel room. Public areas over the top in terms of decor and views. Service in the Lobby Lounge was awful as stated in previous reviews but you kind of let it go when you're just so happy to be there enjoying the view.It's a bit of a nuisance having to take two sets of elevators to get up to your room, but again you get over it - fast. The elevators are very efficient and smooth.We found the doormen, front desk, concierge staff all outstanding. We were offered rides in the hotel cars on a number of occasions.The spa was insanely expensive and I do mean insanely expensive, but the most luxurious spa I've ever been to - oddly the reception staff at the spa were not great in terms of service or competence. Would I do it again? No, I think I'd spend the four figures on dinner somewhere or a new handbag. Glad I tried it though.When booking the hotel and getting confirmations of same I was a little worried - things seemed somewhat unclear and disorganized, but when dealing directly with the hotel and concierge we were extremely happy on every level.My personal preference for location was the FS in terms of shopping on Madison etc., but if you enjoy the mall below the Mandarin then it would be the perfect place to stay - also it's very convenient to the subway if that is a priority. In summary, the FS washrooms are probably a bit better, but not by much, the room decor and ambience of the Mandarin was better in my opinion (not bigger - but better). Location is a personal preference. Service is almost as good as the FS, but as i said it's easy to overlook the shortcomings when you're happy on so many other levels. Give it a try! I would absolutely go back."
50,1870,"Jun 16 2008 	Pricey but great hotel	I stayed 4 days for leisure and had a great time. The view of Central Park (room 4508) was great and the room was very nice. The bed was comfortable. Turn down service in the evening with bottle water is great. The service is impeccable. I loved the &quot;Do not Disturb&quot; or &quot;Make the room&quot; done by a push of a button, that was cool.while I like the bar and the lounge area, breakfast is just ok (food overall is tasteless...): no white bread (olive bread in the morning is a bit hard with orange jam; croissant a bit greasy...), no assam tea (the darjeeling is excellent though). For diner, the wine selection is impressive but food again, is nothing to brag about.Concierges were very helpful and their recommendations quite good. Now the not-so-good part:- Shower: the door was banging 3/4th of the way against the marble so was not really convenient to walk in; to make matter worst, the 'ceiling shower' is just at the entrance, so you get wet when you start it and if you want to get in, then it better be at the right temperature...- Noise: i was surprised to see that there was no &quot;second doors&quot; provided that the room was not too far from the elevator; but the bad part was that you could hear all the conversations in the hallway. Truly the only negative point.- Table by the window: I asked a table by the window for breakfast the first day since there was one available. I was told someone reserved it, eventhoug I insisted. I finished breakfast and no one ever showed up to the table. So much for treating well your guest. I guess next time, I would just go to front desk and ask them to &quot;solve the issue&quot;. The next morning same story, but I just ignored her and sat at the table...Overall, a very nice hotel with a very professional and helpful staff."
51,1870,"Jun 13 2008 	Wow All Around!	My husband and I just spent a weekend here for our anniversary, and virtually everything about this place is a wow -- including the price. We sprung for a Central Park-view room on the 45th floor, and it was the most amazing hotel view we've ever experienced (and at $1100 a night it should be). Our room view was even better than the view from the Lobby Lounge, so we ordered cocktails in the room one night and just relaxed on the backless sectional sofa that ran the entire width of our room right in front of the view. Total indulgence. True, the room was not overly large, but fine for NYC standards and elegantly decorated. My only minor complaint was the weird light switch in the bathroom: you had to hold it down for several seconds each time while the room gradually brightened or darkened. The Lobby Lounge is spectacular, with enormous windows overlooking Columbus Circle and Central Park. To be safe you should make a reservation because it fills up and people linger. (The smaller bar off in the corner is cramped and has no view at all, so don't bother. ) The Lounge hostess, Christina, was extremely accommodating, and once we were able to get a table, she kept &quot;upgrading&quot; us to ones with better views as they became available, even though we hadn't asked. In all, the service was excellent. This hotel is part of the Time Warner building, and you can access the shopping area by taking the elevator down to the third floor. We had a terrific stay and would definitely return -- that is, when we've saved up!"
52,1870,"Jun 11 2008 	'Fan'tastic	My first review on tripadvisor but had to write one for the Mandarin.Everything about my stay was superb. I was originally in a premier central park view room and moved to a deluxe twin as a friend came to join me for the weekend.Both rooms were excellent - with hindsight, I wasn't that worried about a view of central park, it was my first time in New York and felt I had to do it but if I was booking again (which I will be) I would go for the deluxe grade. The room was just as good.Every request made was fulfilled with courtesy, efficiently and guest satisfaction in mind. The only slight negative was breakfast in Assiate. Service was a let down and the coffee cool, but was replaced immediately.Ken on concierge was brilliant - I went to see him about getting to a Broadway show (which he booked) and he ended up planning an entire day of sightseeing for me, including a helicopter tour.My advice is don't hesitate to stay here, yes it's not cheap, but it's so worth the extra."
53,1870,"May 26 2008	Absolutely Incredible!	We (my wife and I) wanted to celebrate an anniversary, and figured that we would drop a little extra coin and stay at the MO NYC. From the minute we arrived nothing but service and style. I arranged for some fresh flowers to be in the room (peonies and chocolate cymbidium orchids)&amp; utilized the concierge for some great dining advice! We stayed in a suite with an awesome view of central park, and used the location to walk to shopping, dinner, and even over to times square to people watch (should have skipped that -- crazy and dirty). We took the D train uptown for the Yankees game, and a quick cab to the meat packing district for dinner (10 minutes) at Vento. The location is great and the room is spectacular."
54,1870,"May 20 2008 	Perfect Hotel	After booking a joint Cunard cruise with a stay in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, the best part of the whole holiday was the stay in the Mandarin Oriental! We strayed in room 5012 overlooking Central Park, Room 3902 two single beds and room 5036 with distant views of the river. Everyone in the hotel from the front desk, concierge and housekeeping could not have been more helpful and everything was delivered and dealt with, with the minimum of fuss to the highest standard.Breakfast in the Asiate Dining Room was perfect and the service excellent with a most wonderful view looking out over Central Park.Meals in the Lobby Bar were excellent and on the second occasion service was slow and when the food arrived it was cold. The Manager took the initiative and waived the bill for the whole meal and a second serving of food arrived shortly after and was excellent. We thought that it was a good example of the standard expected in the hotel and that failure to deliver was taken very seriously by everyone  if only other hotels would adopt the same standard!The rooms were perfect and beautifully finished and even included a tray of sweets for our daughter, especially delivered for her.Overall the perfect experience in what was otherwise a disappointing holiday with Cunard."
55,1870,"Apr 30 2008 	Simply one of the best in NYC	I am just sitting at the airport lounge and just wish to share my 2 nights experience at the MO NYC. Almost everything has been exceptional:THE GOOD:* The lobby on the 35th floor: minimalist but warm deco, great view.* staff: I could not fault anyone in this hotel. Special greeting to the concierge, so so friendly and helpful. Always smilling.* Rooms: good size, very clean, high quality everywhere you look at.* BED: A dream!* Bathroom: gives you a feeling of relaxation through the colours and the delicate smell.* ASIATE Restaurant: clearly one of the most exceptional food I have ever had (believe me, I travel a lot and love eating), with an incredible combination of japanese and european flavours.THE LESS GOOD:* The quality of the bread (both at breakfast and dinner at Asiate):Compared to what is offered now in the US, they have a lot to learn (Try the bread at the Four Seasons 57 restaurant: a huge difference).* Bathroom amenities: More like a *** hotel.Anyhow, and without any doubt, I will come back to MO NYC !"
56,1870,"Apr 15 2008 	New favourite hotel in N.Y.	April 15 Cathi Glasgow U.KJetlagged but had to write this while it was fresh in my mind, because I have found the comments of others so helpful when choosing a hotel...so excuse mistakes.Just back today after holiday at the Mandarin Oriental N.Y with husband and 2 teenagers and can honestly say that we all loved it. Yes it is expensive , room service / mini bar /spa very steep, but we knew that would be the case when we booked. Could not fault the service or the attention to detail and the bed was so comfortable that it was a joy to go to bed. The view from our Central Park suite was amazing at any time of the day or night. Son and daughter's adjoining Deluxe was perfect and although it did not have the view, was a great room too. Gym could perhaps do with more equipment, but was never too busy. Pool was always quiet too. Location was perfect. It was also very useful having the shops/restaurants below, for when we felt too lazy to go further afield, without having to get a taxi. It is a large and busy hotel but apart from lobby/bar area,peace and tranquility reigned. Cant wait to go back"
57,1870,"Apr 6 2008 	Very average experience / Very high prices	Okay, the location of New York's Mandarin Oriental is fabulous (although, as other travelers have mentioned, the Trump Hotel is blocking the views from some floors).Okay, the rooms are relatively spacious (by New York standards) in the most expensive rooms.Okay, the design is great, the pool and the gym are nice.But that's about it.Overall, the atmosphere is very international / standard / impersonal. As a guest, I did not feel particularly welcome or valued (although I was arriving, announced in advance, with the rather expensive hotel limo). The product may be good and the staff may be professional, but this is not a place where I felt genuinely welcomed.For the prices charged, significant improvement is needed in that respect.I mentioned it to the customer relations service, but received no answer to my email. I will not stay there again, unless I am sure these issues have been fixed."
58,1870,"Mar 22 2008 	Loved loved loved the hotel	I've been to a number of Mandarin hotels all over, but I found the one in New York to be quite extraordinary. The room is spacious enough, especially for a New York hotel room, the hotel rate is also affordable enough for a 5 star hotel in New York, and the service is just amazing. If you requested it, you could end up having a wonderful view of the Central Park and watching the sun set over it was truly amazing.The only problem I had was with the door lock ( I stayed there in 2004, so they might have corrected this problem since). If you have bolted the door from inside, an outsider can easily force the door open and twice to yank the bolt from its place. We have told this to the manager.Summary: great stay!"
59,1870,"Mar 17 2008 	Extremely disappointing!	My boyfriend really wanted to stay at the Mandarin Oriental, so we decided to do it for our last night in NYC (we stayed with friends the other nights). He booked an upgraded room with a Central Park view--it was nearly $1000 for the night. We were prepared for the cost as we knew it would be that expensive.We arrived at noon and loved the beautiful interior of the hotel. The staff was friendly and the concierge was very helpful. Our room was ready, but the key system wasn't working so they walked us to the room. It was nice--not very large and has a view of Central Park that is ok--unfortunately it is largely obstructed by the awful Trump building, but that can't be helped. The room and amenities were really just ok--I think that most Westins, Ws, and even up-scale Marriotts were almost as nice. and Ritz Carltons, Four Seasons, and others in that realm are easily comparable. There are some really nice a/v features, and the bathroom is much larger, but I don't think that the marginal difference in quality is even close to the difference in cost. And there were weird things about the bathroom--like no separate light switch or a fan in the little room that has the toilet, terribly slow hot water, not very soft or plush robes, and even really low quality &quot;q-tips&quot; (to be petty). Also, there is not a coffee maker in the room, so you are forced to order room service every time you want hot water for tea or coffee. And the prices for room service are just completely over the top. I guess they just figure that once you are paying that much for a room, a $27/pp (plus service fees) continental breakfast is no big expense. (And it goes up from there.)The worst part, however, is that we slept terribly! The pillows are so soft that you need at least two of them and there weren't extras in the room. The comforter is pretty and soft, but warmed up so much that we were roasting. And the air in the room was so incredibly dry that we really had trouble sleeping. We collectively got about 2 hours of sleep. We were pretty grumpy by morning.The service was very good--all very nice staff people. But the room just didn't live up to the price in any way, shape, or form. We'd have been just as happy at the W or a boutique hotel and would have spent $700 less. Lesson learned: paying the highest cost does not always mean a better experience."
60,1870,"Feb 29 2008 	Luxury Hotel next to Central Park with arrogant staff!	American hotel staff is usually better than in Europe. very well trained and very friendly. Not as good as Asia though. In the Mandarin Oriental the staff was however arrogant. They think you have to be glad to be allowed there. Which is not acceptable when you pay $1500 a night!Yes, I sat next to Lawrence Fishburn in the bar and they were all over him, but I nearly could not get a seat. Bar, restaurant and lounge are way to small, the food and drink selection is poor and extremely expensive for what it is. We like to have long breakfasts and were pushed to leave after we had eaten. We then went to have breakfast in the Landmark restaurant in the shopping center.To top it all up the concierge commented when I disliked his restaurant suggestion: &quot;If you look for a cheaper place, then ...&quot;Finally the bar refused to serve us drinks on New Years at 1am. &quot; Were closing now ...&quot;That is the city that never sleeps?"
61,1870,"Feb 26 2008 	Great Stay here every time we visit New York	Best Bits: Location, great bar, stylish rooms, close to fab shops in Columbus Circle, Loved the gym &amp; poolDown side: Staff can be a bit distant, room service prices are the highest I have ever known, make sure you book a room overlooking Central Park"
62,1870,"Feb 20 2008	my favorite hotel in NY	Mandarin Oriental NY was quite new when we stayed here. I loved its modern architecture, the decoration and the great location. Combination of everything that hotel presents made me feel very good about this hotel. Our room had a great NY view, it was very cleverly and beautifully designed. Both my husband and I enjoyed our three days stay at this hotel very much and looking forward to another opportunity to stay there. As we live in NY now, unfortunately we may not have the opportunity anytime soon."
63,1870,"Feb 5 2008 	New York City at its Best	My partner and I decided to see in the New Year in New York City, which we attempt to visit annually. In discussing where we would stay, we decided on the Mandarin Oriental at Columbus Circle in the Time Warner Building. This was our first visit to the property and we will return many times in the future. In every way, the property and the staff achieved a 6 star level of service; within minutes of our arrival from LaGuardia via the hotel's car service, door staff, front desk staff and management were all greeting us by name! Our guest room on the 53rd floor overlooking the Hudson River, while not oversized, had a beautiful bathroom and was appointed. The bed was very comfortable and in ever way, our guest room met our every expectation. During our 6 night stay, frequently, the doorman would offer us the hotel's car service to the theatre and restaurants! The hotel's proximity to Central Park was a great advantage and we enjoyed our morning walks in the park. A great way to spend a holiday; thanks to everyone at Mandarin Oriental for making our stay so memorable."
64,1870,"Jan 28 2008 	The Mandarin NYC! Why any other hotel?	What can i say about The Mandarin but great things?...i stayed here two nights 01/25/08 -1/27/08 with some friends and absolutely fell in love from the first minute i stepped inside. This is my first time at The Mandarin in NYC and also my very first time in NYC as a matter of fact. Service was top notch from check-in to checkout. Our room was spacious and well organized and included every amenity you could ask for, and if it lacked anything the hotel was more than accommodating to provide you with what you wanted. The bathroom was in pristine condition and having the lcd was a nice touch. The shower was the best part...that shower head with plenty of water pressure can wipe your tensions away. The bed was very very comfortable also along with the samsung sound system made the down time more enjoyable.On several occasions the hotel provided their brand new Escalade to shuttle us to time square and to our dinner locations. Totally unheard of from other hotels i have stayed at unless i paid. They brought us plenty of fiji water that was on the house and even opened the business center for us after hours so we could print our boarding passes...and this was late like almost midnight...the customer service was never ending...i will definitely come back again. Thanks Mandarin for giving the best stay in NYC!...."
65,1870,"Jan 13 2008 	Top of the town	Long weekend in New York, for me and the family, this place was great. The views from the room of the East side where great, the kids loved it. The bar was great for views of central park and the stars that come in for a drink.Its a great hotel and great location."
66,1870,"Jan 11 2008 	The best in New York...?	We stayed in the Mandarin for a romantic weekend this winter. I actually live in New York, and had been to the lobby bar (famous for its views, but otherwise pretty standard stuff)...but never stayed there. First off, it's expensive...very expensive...and considering the Plaza is still closed it's claiming the honor of the Best Hotel In New York. And I guess it is an amazing hotel...the room (Deluxe Central Park View) was big (by NY standards) and well appointed, the bathroom was spacious and beautiful, but let's be clear: you're paying for a view. The windows are giant, and the view is spectacular (we were on the 45th floor). But, the Trump Tower and a new luxury apartment building do partly block your view of the park. The staff was very helpful, the concierge managed to work us into Masa downstairs at the last minute...but all in all, for the money (and the hype) I was expecting just a little more. They also charge for little things like internet access...which for the price I thought was annoying. Maybe I've been spoiled in the past. But I still recommend it for a romantic (and decadent) getaway, or a longer business trip (if you're so lucky)."
67,1870,"Jan 4 2008	2nd stay just as amazing as the first	Spent a weekend at the mandarin to see some broadway (weekend ended up being ruined by strike however) and loved it just as much as our first stay. Hotel rep met us at our car as we arrived and took us up directly to our room, we got to completely bypass check-in which was a definite plus. The room was amazing, among the best in all of ny city. Service was great again as was the room service. It's still extremely expensive but if you can afford it there's no reason to stay anywhere else.ps: The reason why I love mandarin's more than any other ultra lux chain? Because, as far as rooms go, what you see is what you get. There is never any mystery as far as how your room will look. Go on their website, every room as pictures and your room will look EXACTLY like the one you see on the website. In many older hotels every single room is decorated differently and you never know what your going to get, the mandarin is a refreshing exception."
68,1870,"Dec 22 2007	Paramount	Being the most exceptional hotel in the capital of the world that is New York City must be very demanding. I felt that Mandarin lived up to its reputation in every respect. Located on top 20 floors of the most recent city landmark, the magnificent Time Warner center, the hotel offers unparalleled views of Central Park and Hudson River. Our room on the 52d floor was impeccable, with wall-high windows opening up to sweeping panorama of the city that never sleeps.The service at Mandarin is truly remarkable. When checking-in I mentioned it was my wife's birthday. When we came back to our room after exploring the city to our suprise we found the complimentary bottle of champagne and delicious chocolate cake waiting for us.The hotel is a favorite destination for celebrities (and apparently photographers who were hanging out in front of the entrance) so running into a Hollywood A-lister or the likes of Ryan Seacrest is somewhat of a usual thing. The location at Columbus Circle is one of the best in Manhattan, very convenient and in proximity to everything in Midtown."
69,1870,"Dec 12 2007 	A few tips	If you need a view, get ready for &quot;partial&quot; with a building generally blocking most of it out. Having sampled the entire inventory, I think the best rooms are the doubles with suffix &quot;32&quot;m which face north, with a parkview comparable to the straight &quot;central park view&quot; category and also featuring the GW bridge at night. The &quot;32&quot; is also a bit bigger than the other parkview rooms. The best room in the house is next door, the suite with suffix &quot;33&quot; - here you get the full south-clockwise-to-park (or Statue of Liberty, Hudson River, GW Bridge, Manhattan and Central Park). Ignore the advice if you are a fan of midtown skyscrapers.The pool and spa are well worth a visit.Lunch at the hotel restaurant is very, very good; the bento box is excellent.If you exit the elevators on the third floor mall entrance, you can step around the corner to the Bouchon Bakery for an excellent and quick breakfast/snack/sandwich."
70,1870,"Oct 27 2007 	Stunning but reception lets it down a bit	I stayed here for 2 nights on business, straight from its sister hotel in London (which I had found rather stuffy). I did feel that the one thing that prevents this hotel getting a 5-star rating from me was the reception - check-in was not particularly efficient and more to the point, there was a very indifferent attitude on the part of the staff there. The staff at the concierge desk downstairs were a lot more helpful and friendly.Everything else was stunning. I didn't have time to sample all the hotel's offerings like spa and pool as it wasn't a leisure trip, but the bar on the reception floor was lovely. Food was good. The room was perhaps slightly small but as it was only me it was fine. Decor and amenities in the room were top-notch. I was on a 50-something floor overlooking Columbus Circle - even at that height the circle was still slightly noisy, but there was a gorgeous view over Central Park albeit slightly obscured by the Trump hotel."
71,1870,"Oct 20 2007 	Loved it!	I booked my husband and I into the MO for 2 nights as a suprise birthday trip to NYC. I booked way in advance and got a rate of $809 per night on the hotel website for a junior suite on a higher floor overlooking Central Park. The room was fabulous and they gave us champagne and cake on hearing that it was his birthday. We took our 1 year old with us and they provide a great baby sitting service. My son loved looking out the window as did we. They provided a toy and toiletries for our son along with the crib and took really good care of all 3 of us. The staff were all very nice and helpful. The lady at the lobby bar was rather snooty, but it appears to be her job to find out if you are staying there as if you are not you will not get a table. We were visiting friends who live there and some who flew in from LA and they insisted on checking out the room and hotel and were stunned at the size of the room and bathroom and the breathtaking views.After reading earlier reviews I did stress on checking in that it was my husband's birthday and I wanted a room with a view that wasn't blocked by the Trump Tower. The view is what I paid the top dollar for and we weren't dissapointed. If you book early, its well worth the money. I definitely wouldn't pay rack rates for it though."
72,1870,"Sep 20 2007	Great if you like being rodgered for no apparent reason	Ok, so its the MO, the newest addition to the high class hotel scene in NY, one of the coolest cities on the planet - it's GOT to be good. Well yeah, its exactly that - good, it's not great. It's got a dramatic and original lobby (unless you've stayed at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo), it's got a spacious spa which looks impressive and well equipped (not compared with the one in the Four Seasons in Hong Kong) and it has the genuine pimp factor associated with staying in a hotel of this calibre (not on a par with rocking up to the George V in Paris). This is a good hotel with all of the artillery required to arm it for future greatness but ultimately it doesnt deliver if you are a truely discerning traveller. I didnt have a bad stay in this hotel but as other reader's have commented with all of the hype and the fanfare expectations are high. If you like being rodgered and want to tell your mates you stayed there, DO IT!! It's close proximity to Per Se and Masa is a good enough reason if you are a foodie."
73,1870,"Aug 29 2007 	Great Hotel !	We stayed at this hotel whilst on honeymoon, it was fantastic!Our hotel room was one of the more basic type due to the cost but it was still lovely. We arrived late at night to a bottle of champagne and chocolate cake, slippers by our bed and fluffy robes in the bathroom. The bed was incredibly comfy and the view out of the window stunning. The bathroom had a huge shower cubicle, a lovely deep bath and a tv.Whilst visiting, my daughter was ill, the cleaner came straight away and the hotel sent my daughter a complimentary bag, hat and t-shirt to cheer her up. The staff were very nice but professional.The hotel pool and facilities are excellent.It was a delight getting married in NY and staying in this hotel."
74,1870,"Aug 20 2007	All the right touches	This beats all three of the Ritz Carlton hotels I've stayed in. The service is just what you need; no more no less, and highly personalized. I donned the complimentary bathrobe and reclined in the divan adjoining the the picture window. The room overlooked Central Park from the 51st floor.Had an amazing sleep on the Sealy Posturepedic 700 featherbed with down pillows. The dimmer switch for the bathroom is a nice way to wake up.Took a luxurious shower underneath the waterfall showerhead. Preparing for a business meeting in the morning, I wondered how I looked and then noticed the 10' X 3' window next to the bed."
75,1870,"Aug 12 2007 	Gorgeous hotel !	We've just returned home from a one week stay in this fabulous hotel and I honestly cannot find anything negative to say about the experience. We had a deluxe Hudson River view room that interconnected with our 2 teenagers. The views were superb, the room immaculately clean and the facilities wonderful. There was also a plentiful supply of bathroom goodies by Aromatherapy Associates which smelt heavenly - I'm going to try and get my hands on some in the UK as I forgot to buy them at the hotel shop. The location is brilliant - a 10 minute walk to Times Square and right next to Central Park. This hotel was an oasis of calm and luxury that we enjoyed returning to after each hectic day of sightseeing. I couldn't bear to stay anywhere else if I return to New York !"
76,1870,"Aug 11 2007 	Average...actually	Im not sure what people expect when they got to a hotel that is supposed to be the best in New York. I will tell you the I personally expect to be blown away and was not. Yes the lobby is nice and the rooms are nice but so are a hundred other hotels in New York. As a matter of fact you will even find better beds at a lower class hotel. As far as the restaurant in the hotel and the view from the lobby I would say yes they are very nice. I would recommend you just do that if you feel like this hotel is the place for you. The location of the hotel is in the Time Warner building so it is a little less of the rumble and tumble of NY. However, because of this you are on the opposite side of the high fashion shops on the other side of the park. Last, If you see the picture of the pool don't be sad when you actually see it. The spa while I did not use it seemed nice. I went here for one night with my wife. We are young and just got married. If you have kids and/or enjoy a mall like experience you may not find this review helpful."
77,1870,"Aug 7 2007 	Superb hotel	First time staying at a Mandarin anywhere. Usually stay at Four Seasons, but as this was unavailable, decided to try the Mandarin. Nice room, very clean, excellent service, great view, great location, and nice bar. They don't have all the employees remember and call you by your name when they see you ( a la Four Seasons), but other than that, it's top notch."
78,1870,"Jul 19 2007	The Best Hotel in NYC	Fabulous, Fabulous, Fabulous! It may be expensive, but offers great service, immaculate rooms and breathtaking views of the Hudson and Central Park. We stayed in a Hudson view room (Floor 54), which was spacious and very quiet. The bathtub next to the window had an amazing view and the room was generally well serviced.Try and avoid rooms near the elevators though. They are in constant use and I'm sure the noise would annoy light sleepers. Luckily we were nowhere near them!The shopping mall below the hotel is also great. If you don't want to pay $35 each for breakfast in the hotel, you can wander down to 'Borders' where you can get a fab Dean and Deluca coffee and muffin!The most beautiful view of Central Park is from the hotel bar at sunset.Treat yourself and a have a great time!"
79,1870,"Jul 11 2007 	Very good but not exceptional	I'm writing this review whilst actually in my room at the Mandarin Oriental. I think it's better that way.Yes, the room is lovely, and yes, the staff are polite.However, having booked for 3 guests over 4 months ago, it has taken 6 hours, 4 phone calls, 1 visit to reception a lot of angriness to get a rollaway bed delivered for my son.You can have all of the orchids in the world, 100 TV channels and the fluffiest robes, but what does the inability to provide anough beds tell you?Around $800/night ought to provide flawless service. I Shan't stay here again."
80,1870,"Jul 2 2007	So good it's one of the top hotels in America	I travel on business all the time, and I see lots of hotel aspiring to greatness. It comes down to this, MONY has the most wonderful, accommodating, gracious staff imaginable. No offense to a great city, but NY is not always known for fabulous service. This staff outshines every hotel I have ever seen. It's not perfect. The Lounge Manager was downright rude. But that was one person and one day. The rooms have goodies and gizmos in every nook and cranny...in fact too many...the TV is difficult to use. But again, that sense of calm, the utter professionalism, the attention to detail. It was worth the extreme price and I will stay any time I have the opportunity."
81,1870,"Jun 27 2007 	Fantastic location but	I have just returned from a four night stay at the Mandarin, The location is superb, on Colombus Circle overlooking Central Park, above a good shopping centre. We had a corner suite with views over the park and the Hudson river. Amazing rooms because of the views but the decor was fairly bland for a hotel of this standing. The body lotion, etc in the bathroom were fantastic all from the company Sugar. I was very lucky as a friend's new boyfriend was paying otherwise this would have been out of my league. However I have been lucky enough to stay in some pretty amazing hotels across the world and somehow the Mandarin just misses. The attention to small details is lacking. Housekeeping left food from room service in the room for 12 hours until we called twice to have it removed. Water was stocked daily but only at night, it was not replenished in the morning without phoning and requesting it. Services are very expensive, $30 for a cup of tea from room service. If money is no object and location key, stay here, otherwise look for something a little less coporate and better value for money.During our stay we ate at Gramercy Tavern, always excellent, Per Se, truly a foodie experience and great staff, Stanton Social, brilliant fun and wonderful food."
82,1870,"Jun 17 2007 	Overall the best in New York and not bad world-wide	Stayed at the MONY over 2.5 weeks end May. Having stayed at the Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton Central Park, Essex House and St. Regis before, I can objectively say that the MO has the best overall package.Incentives to stay:1) Modern and new, it is not frayed like the Ritz-Carlton and 4 Seasons and occupies a modern building without the creaks and sounds like at the Ritz-Carlton just down the road.2) The rooms are very spacious for central park hotels. Stayed in a standard room.3) All rooms have a view. Either Central Park or the Hudson. While many of the park views are partially blocked by the Trump, for the same price at the others I've mentioned above, frankly you'd be looking at the air well or another room's window.4) The concierge is excellent. They were friendly, on the ball and went out of their way. Only the 4 Seasons and I hear, the Carlyle, can compare or exceed.5) The techno deck-out in the room is the best I've encountered in NY. TV in bathroom, fax machine and multi-line phone for conference calls and internet on the flat-screen TV are standard features.6) A lot of people write it's expensive. Frankly, I think it's more than reasonable compared to other similar 5 stars along Central Park ways. The Ritz-Carlton charges 10-15% more for far worse. The 4 seasons is also more expensive. You need to compare apples with apples. No point comparing it to say the Novotel or Radisson.Discentives:1) Service is still spotchy. It is getting there but some kinks remain. The doormen do not open the doors or greet you with a smile. Bad first impression.2) Housekeeping can be a little wobbly with replacing things. However, this seems to be a NY/Western Hemisphere thing in general.3) The partially blocked views as mentioned. To be nitpicking, clear views would be great. However, if you are thinking about moving to the Trump for the view, think again. The same price will not get you a Central Park or even Hudson view. You get a view of a next door building and maybe the MO :-) I checked.4) Having travelled extensively in Asia as well, frankly most hotels in the Western Hemisphere need to catch up. Service, amenities, room space all pale next to the Asian hotels. I don't look at cost since cost of living is far higher in NY compared to say, Bangkok. Still, MONY is the closest I've come across in the U.S. to a class act nearly on par with it's Asian counterparts.It is my pick for a NY hotel."
83,1870,"May 10 2007 	Still the best in New York City!	This was our sixth stay at the Mandarin Oriental NYC since they first opened (when it was cheap), and it is still an amazing experience. The location is the best you can find, right next to the park and connected to the popular Columbus Circle which provides great shopping. We reserved a central park view suite this time, which provided amazing views of the park - it was very spacious (especially for NYC standards) and included every luxury you could possibly desire. The service and help was outstanding as always, especially the concierge who helped us with our dinner reservations on very short notice. The Mandarin Oriental lobby bar and restaurant both provide some of the best views of New York city that you can find - we ate breakfast every morning overlooking the park from the 35th floor. The only minor drawback which we encountered is the usually slow bar service in the lobby bar in the evenings. It often takes 10-20 minutes to get your drinks / order once an order is placed -(which is the norm for some reason since they have opened), but with a such outstanding view and environment we will gladly put up with that. We are already looking forward to our next visit."
84,1870,"Apr 30 2007 	Hurray for the Mandarin NYC!!!	Best in NYC! The room and bathroom were finely appointed, rich and modern at the same time. The tea service upon arrival is a very nice touch. The bed was great, bath great also. It is so nice to have a good place to end each day. Room service was prompt and food was very good. The restaurant off the lobby was ok, flavors to complex and trendy...not worth the price. The spa is devine, a must do. The lobby / spa views of the park are fantastic . The hotel is expensive but it is a sanctuary for the soul. We should all live like this all of the time.I have stayed all over nyc and this is my favorite hotel."
85,1870,"Apr 17 2007 	We think welcome means something different!	We have just spent 5 nights at the Mandarin in New York. There to share a 60th birthday celebration with London friends and see my (American) husband's family for a visit. On arrival at 1pm we were told that our room was not yet ready (which we expected) but asked for the number in order to give it to our friends who had checked in the previous day at the hotel. The receptionist stumbled an answer 'oh we are not yet sure which one it is'. We are frequent travellers and whenver I hear this response I know that we are about to be told that we have been 'upgraded' and then shown to one of every 5 star hotels 'less than great' rooms. It has happened before. We already had a written confirmation of a deluxe Hudson River view room on a high floor which is what we wanted. Our friends had the same room type reserved so we went to see it. When 'our room' was ready - upgraded we were told, it was of course inferior on all counts, we asked to be changed to our confirmed room which was fine. Why do hotels do this. Theatres charge a lesser price for 'restricted view' seats. We all know that there will always be a few rooms in any fine hotel that are less good and the hotels would serve themselves well if they advertised these at lower prices. Instead what they try to do is hope that the client they put in these rooms will be too intimidated to ask for a change. I hate this especially as when we came into the downstairs lobby at the Mandarin via the lift to the 35th floor where the hotel starts, every employee greeted us en route 'welcoming' us to the Mandarin.Apart from this start, the hotel was good, modern and had most things one would expect. Except no coffee making equipment in the rooms - I think they think us (their clients) too 'posh' to make their own coffee but I know we both hated having to get up to find a cup. Most guests seemed to feel the same and popped out to the Starbucks across the road to pick up their morning coffees, but in the room would have been great.Weather was freezing in New York (6-11 April) but the lobby of the hotel on the 35th floor was kept cold by air conditioning - perhaps someone might mention global warming to the Mandarin.This is an expensive hotel which looks good and has all the trappings of a first class hotel but has no heart and not much of a genuine warmth to it. We have been to fine hotels where they manage to have boths looks and heart. We would not stay there on our next visit. Our friends who had also stayed at the Mandarin in Singapore said it wasn't a patch on that."
86,1870,"Mar 21 2007 	Loved the HOT Stone massage!	Everything about the Mandarin was 5 star.... the food, service, decor and spa. You must visit the spa and get at least 1 treatment....and go early so you can enjoy the relaxation room!"
87,1870,"Mar 15 2007	Love It When Someone Else is Paying	Fantastic hotel, great location, amazing views, and the best lounge in the city BUT you certainly pay for itGrab a park view room for special occasions or when someone else is picking up the tab"
88,1870,"Mar 13 2007 	compelling hotel	I have stayed at the Mandarin many times since it opened, and my recent visit confirmed my affection for it. Major positives include: a great, apparently stable staff; amazing views, wonderful location and great facilities such as the pool/spa and cool lobby lounge. The hotel is very expensive due to persistently high occupancy, and the food is not very special. Skip room service and head to Cafe Gray (or Nougatine across the street) which have extensive hours. Even the bar there is a glamorous dining experience."
89,1870,Feb 23 2007 	Really Nice. Suprising Service Flaws	A nice hotel. Have used this group on other continents. This trip exposes some subtle flaws. Coffee ordered this morning at 9 am took almost 1 hour to arrive. Bathroom amenities are shabbily arranged. Complimentary city maps and other offerings are torn and incomplete.All would be acceptable at a property charging a much lower price.Mandarin ought look at their local management for answers.
90,1870,"Feb 7 2007 	You Would Not Want to Leave IT!	King size bed with central park view at US$699/night. Flawless service and execution, great atmosphere, mighty bar with views, excellent food, good spa, location at Columbus Circle, baby sitter for our 2 year old arranged at 3 hour notice.... The list can go on and on. I have travelled the world and stayed at some best hotels, including Peninsula in NY and Shangri La in Singapore, but this one left a special mark. look no further and enjoy!"
91,1870,"Feb 4 2007 	Wonderful Hotel Great Service	We have been staying at the Mandarin Oriental NYC since they opened, and it is still just as fantastic as the day it opened. From the moment you arrive everything is perfect, and they will cater to your every need(s). We stayed in a suite overlooking Central Park which was amazing. The rooms are larger then any we have stayed at in NYC, and they have double sinks in every room which makes mornings much easier. The lobby bar/lounge serves great snacks and cocktails throughout the day and at night it is reserved for hotel guests only. It is very expensive, but definitely worth it if you want a first class experience all the way."
92,1870,"Jan 30 2007 	The reasons to stay at the MO	Look, its not quite a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons experience in terms of service and employee talent level but there are plenty of reasons to pay the money and stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Plenty. Such as:Location: At Columbus Circle across the street from Central Park. Easy walking commute to all the areas you want to be in midtown and great sightlines in a spectacular building.The mall/ Whole Foods: The MO lobby is on the 35th floor of a skyscraper that houses a nice mall with four or five high-end restaurant choices and an enormous Whole Foods with a large selection of prepared foods. If its unusually cold out or raining, this is an invaluable perk. We went downstairs in the morning (well, my wonderful wife did) and got great, organic breakfast items and we ate them in our room, saving tons in the process.The lobby lounge: Plenty has been written here and none of it exaggerates the view and the atmosphere. Awesome.The room: Bigger and better than many NYC high-end hotel rooms. Fantastic view. Well appointed and functional. Top notch. Modern but classy. Bathroom was superb.Gym: Small but free, which is not the norm in many hotels these days. Good cardio equipment with TVs in them. Excellent indoor lap pool. We booked through Platinum Am Ex and received a room upgrade, a 4 PM checkout, a $100 spa voucher and continental breakfast each morning. All for $630 or so. Well worth it. Weve recently stayed at both RCs in NYC and The Sofitel and enjoyed them all but itll be MO from now on for us."
93,1870,"Jan 8 2007 	Loved it but over priced.	An absolutely stunning hotel, with excellent &quot;touches&quot; free teas/coffees/fruit from the gym, the evening turn down, the ipods to listen to excellent stuff indeed BUT it is vastly overpriced. The central park view rooms have 2 buildings in the way highly frustration when a 2 night stay cost nearly 1000, and the fact that breakfast is not included and is incredibly expensive takes away from the incredibly location and general feel of the hotel. I loved my stay but wouldn't go back unless is was a lot cheaper. There are better places to stay for a lot less money."
94,1870,"Dec 29 2006 	Way overpriced for the lack of service	I am a big fan of the Four Seasons in new york. I tried to get a room for NYE weekend and it was sold out. I am currently staying at the Mandarin Oriental and it is very disapointing.They didn't have my room ready for 3pm check in, had a rollaway in the room that I didn't request. Takes forever to get something to your room.Also they send me a &quot;customer profile&quot; to fill out and send to them. I filled it out and sent it back to them, but I didn't notice that they read it at all...I am in the travel biz and I don't mind paying big $$$ for hotel rooms around the world. The problem that I have is when you pay top dollar and you receive service on the same level when you could have spent $400 a night.I won't be coming back"
95,1870,Dec 26 2006 	When only the best will do.	I recently stayed with my girlfriend at the Mandarin and thought it was an exquisite hotel. You enter the hotel lobby by elevator (I think it is around the 40th floor where the hotel begins. You exit out the elevator into the hotel lobby which has very high ceilings and has a beautiful view of Central Park. There is an excellent bar which is to the right of the lobby which also serves the most divine desserts that I and my girlfriend have ever tasted. We routinely dine at the finest (according to Zagat) restaurants on Long Island and NYC for your reference. To the left is the hotel's signature restaurant and directly sunken in front of the lobby is a nice lounge area reserved for hotel guests. All of these areas have beautiful high city and park views. On to the room =&gt; The room that we booked overlooked Central Park. The ceiling height must have been at least 15 Feet to the best of my recollection with large floor to ceiling windows the length of the room. The room was large by NYC standards. The marble bath room was very large and had separate showering and toilet and makeup areas. There was french door separating the bath room from the hallway. While there we had occassion to order dinner from room service. The kitchen answered promptly at 11:30PM and had dinner to us &quot;in 20 minutes&quot; which was actually 15 minutes. The dinner and desserts were excellent and the staff was very courteous. Our room also included breakfast for the $1400 nightly fee at their signature restaurant in the morning. We headed down about 9AM and found a beautiful bright dining area that was buzzing with activity. The service was very prompt. The breakfast was a continental breakfast and was also excellent. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. You get what you pay for. It is clearly one of the best in Manhattan. I would stay here again without hesitation especially because of the beautiful rooms with high city and park views.
96,1870,"Nov 6 2006 	Great views POOR service.	We did not stay at the hotel , however had lunch. The view is fantastic, the crowd pleasant to study.The service was TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. Waiters rude and in the end complaning about the lack of sufficient tips....... i will NEVER step ito that place again."
97,1870,"Oct 14 2006 	Too expensive for what it was....	I booked a Hudson River View Deluxe Room over the phone for a rate of approx $900 per night. The room itself was beautiful, quiet with glorious views across to the river. The bathroom was huge, with its own flatscreen TV by the bath and a refreshing &quot;waterfall&quot; shower. The corridors and public spaces were gloomy and the main bar was so dark my husband nearly tripped going down the stairs to our table. The restaurant Asiate had great food, and the hotel concierge was extremely helpful. The pool was large but a little chilly, though this isn't a problem if you are a serious swimmer. Annoyingly, you have to pay for Internet access and the room services prices are astronomical. We ended up buying dinner one evening from the great deli in the Columbus Circle downstairs to eat back in our room! Our fellow guests were mainly Russian &quot;businessmen&quot; and unfriendly Europeans.In summary, the hotel has the prices of the Four Seasons, but doesn't have the understated and welcoming chic of the Four Seasons."
98,1870,"Oct 13 2006 	Loved it!	Stayed at the Mandarin Oriental hotel with my daughter as a weekend getaway. We had reserved a corner Hudson view room and were upgraded at check-in to a Central Park view room on the 46th floor.The view was fantastic! The window had a full view of Central Park. The Trump International hotel took up just one small corner of the view off to the side. The park really commanded the view. It was great!The plasma tv with DVD player and laptop capability was very high tech. The tv was programmed with a special welcome message which went away after use. The plasma tv in the bathroom was a nice touch as well. The all marble bathroom was nice with seperate shower and big walk in shower.The service was awesome. From the room upgrade to the doormen. The doormen were at the car as soon as we pulled up, welcoming us. Upon departure, I forgot to call in advance to get my car so it took about 5 minutes (no big deal) for them to retreive it. The doorman offered us bottled water while we were waiting since it was a hot day. The front desk person showed us to the elevator and then handed off the key, offering to carry my shoulder bag up to the room. We ordered room service and it arrived in 30 minutes. The food was good. My daughter called the front desk for bubble bath and they went out and bought some, delivering it in a cute bag.The lounge in the lobby was excellent. My teenage daughter was excited because we actually met a couple of celebrities who were staying at the hotel."
99,1870,"Oct 8 2006 	1st Class or what!!	We recently stayed at the MO in New York for 2 nights as part of our 25th Wedding Anniversary Celebrations last week - end September 06). On arrival at the Hotel there was Champagne &amp; Chocolate awaiting us in our room! We had dinner there on the 2nd night and when we only asked for one dessert they insisted on two - we couldn't understand why - until they both arrived and had 'Happy Anniversary' piped in chocolate on each - such a lovely touch. We had booked the Hotel as part of our trip with Cunard - we travelled to NY on the QM2 - for some reason Cunard felt we had been delayed on disembarkation in Bayonne and there was a lovely card and chocolates apologising for delay - again a lovely touch. As 'piece de resistance' we had booked the Private Spa at MO for 3 hours and WOW! We were allowed 1/2 to ourselves before being giving the most wonderful foot massage whilst the Massuers explained everything that would happen and gained information from us, to enable them to maximise our time their with treatments suited to each of us. Then Lunch! Amazing!! All in all an absolutley 1st class hotel, 1st Service and no complaints whatsoever. I sincerely hope we can return there some day!"
100,1870,"Oct 3 2006 	Nice stay at a Luxury hotel that is showing some wear	My husband and I returned to the Mandarin in New York recently for our anniversary. We first stayed there 2 years ago following our wedding. The first stay was amazing - the property was still &quot;new&quot; and everything about it seemed luxurious. This time around we noticed a few things were lacking. The furniture is beginning to show wear, especially in the Lobby Lounge. We were given a handicapped room, of which the only problem I had was that the shower had a regular plastic curtain instead of glass. Diminished the luxe somewhat for me. The bathing amenities were very nice, as were the towels, robes and linens. The LCD TV was o.k - the HDTV channels went out several times which was quite annoying. We had to call IT to come reset it. The bed is extremely comfortable - definitely a highlight! The service is still pretty high-level, but nothing that I haven't experienced at other hotels.The Lobby Lounge is great! The view is fantastic and unparalleled- I definitely recommend stopping there for a drink or dessert.The location of the hotel is very convenient. Great shops in walking distance, and the subway is around the corner. Overall, our stay was pleasant and the accommodations were nice, but I do not think we will stay there again. It doesn't seem as luxurious as it once was."
101,1870,"Sep 24 2006	Mandarin was wonderful	Overall, we were thrilled with the Mandarin. The location was great for us - you have your own entrance to the Shops at Columbus Circle, which includes Whole Foods and Bouchon Bakery. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is elegant and luxurious without being stuffy. The front desk was exceptionally warm and welcoming, especially to our children. A smiling face can make such a difference.We stayed in an executive suite with a connecting park-view bedroom, and it was plenty of room for a family of four. The views from the suite were mostly looking west to the Hudson River - we really loved the views. The view from the park-view bedroom is dominated by Trump's hotel and another huge building in the process of being built - you only have a glimpse of the park squeezed in between these two buildings. Otherwise, that bedroom was great.The layout of the suite is a little awkward - rooms in the suite are off of a long, crooked hallway. Also, the main door from our suite to the hotel's hallway didn't connect solidly with the wall, so there was a slightly open gap, meaning we could hear a lot of noises in the hallway and even see a little into the hallway. But, since all of our rooms inside of the suite were off the crooked hallway, it didn't matter too much.The pool is simply gorgeous. It's in a very light-filled, long room on the 36th floor. It was almost empty both times we used it and the staff was very nice. There were a few mix-ups with housekeeping, including one time when she just walked right into our suite. The woman was very sweet and polite, so it wasn't a problem. The only truly negative aspect of this hotel is the price. It is shockingly, obscenely expensive. But, I must admit, I think it was worth it. We have great memories from this hotel."
102,1870,"Sep 21 2006	Great facilities - but service lacklustre	Good things about this property - unlike most of the luxury hotels in NYC, the facilities are new, and the rooms are not tired. Because of the location of the hotel, the entire hotel is quiet - no real street noise. Bathrooms are great.Bad things - it is very expensive, and the service is simply not up to snuff for the type of property it pretends to be. Get ready for clumsy checkin, botched reservations (in the hotel's own restaurants ?) and generally blah service (even worse that what you would normally expect for high end NYC hotels). I've now stayed here a few times, and on each occasion, the experience has been the same. So, caveat emptor - you will pay dearly for a beautiful room, but if you are expecting service commensurate with the facilities, you will be disappointed - for that, try the FS instead."
103,1870,"Sep 6 2006	Extrarodinary Hotel	Having read several rather negative reviews on TA, I was wondering what to expect for my $1,000 a night Park View Grand de Luxe Room. I have been here for 7 nights with another 5 or so to go, so have had plenty of opportunity to work out the pros and cons.I write this as a regular guest at 4 Seasons, Ritz Carlton and the like and a frequent visitor to Hong Kong which has some of the best hotels in the world.I am lost for words at the excellence of this hotel which surpasses not only my expectations, but pretty much all my previous hotel stay expreiences. This is a truly superb hotel. It is is beautifully fitted out, the service is excellent (possibly only 9 out of 10 owing to some glitches in the public lobby lounge which is not as well staffed as the guest areas) and the overall experience is one of pampered luxury. Contrary to the experiences described in other reviews, the staff have been excpetionally friendly (the maitre'd knew at Asiate knew my name after one visit and made a point of greeting me by name thereafter).There is a wonderful pool. small but uncrowded and wonderful for laps or just wallowing.The views of Central Park (I am on the 52nd floor) are superb, even allowing for the fact that the Trump Hotel blocks part of the view.The hotel exudes an air of oppulent luxury and well-being.There is only one issue, which is the price. Everything is phenomenally expensive (continental breakfast in the room at around $45) and laundry that costs more than it would to replace the items that have been laundered.On this occasion I am not picking up the tab and the prices do not, therefore, disturb me. I think it is the price that probably accounts for a great deal of the dissatisfaciton expresssed in other reviews, as it is hard to imagine how this hotel could ever really deliver what most people would expect for rooms costing upwards of $1,000 per night, when the price is coming out of their own pockets.In summary this is a wonderful hotel, but I would advise against staying here if you are paying for it yourself and will be making a very detailed cost benefit analysis. This is a place for those on expenses, for celebs, for those who are truly hardened to paying for hotels of this class and for those who recognise that they are splashing out a very large amount of money for an unusually opulent treat."
104,1870,"Sep 5 2006	Top notch service	Service was what you'd expect when you are paying this kind of money--top notch. Everyone I encountered was solicitous and eager to help. The room had a flat panel TV with computer control, including internet access, but I never used it--hey we were in NYC! The bathroom was very roomy and all marble, as you'd expect. Very comfy bed. Open the curtains when you turn out the lights - great view to sleep by.Lots of VIPs stay here. We saw Danny Devito in the street level lobby, and he was nice enough to talk.Next to the upper lobby, there's a 5 star restaurant (Asiate) and bar with outstanding views of Central Park.Great location: The Columbus Circle subway is just steps away. You also have your own private passageway to the &quot;Shops at Columbus Circle&quot; mall in the Time Warner Center. Lincoln Center is a few blocks North. Cabs are only a few seconds wait with the energetic doormen at the ground floor lobby."
105,1870,"Sep 5 2006 	Amongst the very best in NY	They certainly aren't the largest rooms in Manhattan but the hotel just felt very New York to me-- quintessentially so, overlooking the park, in the upper floors of a slick (but perhaps soulless) skyscraper. The modern rooms (probably amongst the newest in the city?) are slick and far superior to the competitors like Four Seasons, although not as large. The location is good with excellent access throughout the city, but aside from the park, you don't have as much immediacy as being on Fifth Avenue or in the heart of SoHo Stunning lobby with views of Central Park. Like most other Mandarin Orientals, the service is extremely professional although it can be a little cold at times (especially with all that marble). The prix fixe lunch at Asiate is a very reasonable deal as well-- not outstanding food, but well worth the price."
106,1870,"Aug 23 2006 	State-of-the-art just like the price tag	I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental at Columbus Circle for three nights; I booked a grand deluxe double room with a view of Time Warner Centers second tower and partially on the Hudson River and Columbus Circle. Everything looks fresh and new and the room is very well appointed, its definitely of a decent size, considering Manhattan standard; I particularly enjoyed the Samsung LCD TV screen and DVD player. The bathroom is awesome offering both a bathtub and a separate shower, a small flat panel LCD screen located near the mirror is a touch of class; everything is state of the art. The hotel lacks of complimentary Wi-Fi access, 15 bucks will grant you internet access for 24 hours only; I definitely would have expected a free connection from a property of this standing. The hotel signature connection is your only option if you need to check the mail or surf the web, theres no other ISP reachable from your room or public hotel area; thank God Starbucks T-Mobile connection is just across the road from the hotel entrance. I had breakfast at Asate restaurant, the place offers an unmatched view over Central Park and Columbus Circle, we had a corner table with an awesome view over Central Park during a stunning sunshine day, the cuisine is exquisite though VERY expensive, dining with your party will cost you as your Zegna suite, but dont worry you can always buy a new one on Fifth Avenue. The staff is exceptionally friendly. Its an experience you definitely have to try.Finally, the hotel is conveniently positioned at upscale Columbus Circle with private access to Time Warner Center shopping and restaurants.The Mandarin Oriental New York is an oasis of tranquility and style, but everything comes at a price."
107,1870,"Aug 21 2006 	Mandarin's Dirty Little Secret	Here's the dirty little secret: the hotel doesn't face the Park.Any time you are facing the Park, you are really facing the back of Trump's hotel (at least 50% of your view is of the Trump hotel). The Park stretches north to south, from 59th Street to 110th Street. I doubt you can see further north than 65th Street from any point in the entire Mandarin hotel, except maybe the roof.On the Hudson River side, the views actually are better, but the rooms are awful. The footprint of the hotel is such that all Hudson River rooms are across the hall from either the elevator, the service elevator, or the Housekeeping Closet. When I asked to change from the room opposite the elevator (literally, from my bed, I could hear people making small talk as they waited for the elevator), I was warned the other rooms were worse. This was true. I took the room opposite the Housekeeping Closet; I might as well have taken a shift, I was that close to the action. Really, is it too much to ask that for $750 a night they figure out a way to get you a room that is quiet?The Mo Bar was fine: views were fair (again, the Trump Hotel), the food was poor, the drinks were ok, and the prices were absurd.The Spa was qactually uite nice, but there are better in New York, and the prices were the most obscene I've ever encountered anywhere.Overall, I've stayed in better Mandarin hotels, and I've stayed in better hotels in New York. I was not impressed."
108,1870,"Aug 17 2006	What a complete rip off!	As part of my honeymoon my new husband and I stopped at the Manderin Oriental in New York. We requested a Central Park view which if we tilted our heads and looked through the high rise buildings we could just about make out some trees. We also booked the honeymoon package where we would have champagne and strawberries in our room on arrival (no champagne or strawberries to be found) and also exclusive use of the spa VIP room including treatments. When asked when we could use this facility we were given a look of &quot;haven't you already booked your date?&quot;. It turns out the someone from the spa should have contacted us to make the booking but this hadn't happened. Luckily they were able to squeeze us in and it really was fantastic. The only bit of our stay that was. We had arranged a airport transfer with the hotel for a rather costly sum and when speaking to the concierge to arrange our transport back were we told that the payment made only took us one way, we would have to pay another $151.12 to be taken back to the airport. A total of $302.24! To rub salt in the wounds the driver told us that if we had contacted Virgin Atlantic we would have had the transfers for free. On the first night we arrived late and decided to eat in the hotel restaurant, the food was fine but very overpriced (and we left still feeling hungry). A further insult came while settling the bill. We decided to pay by cash and using the available funds on us settled the bill and left a rather moderate tip. (the service hadn't been that exciting to warrant a huge tip) The waiter took our money but then sent the restaurant manager back to ask why we had only left a 10% tip and not the usual 15-20%. To be honest I didn't think that we had been especially looked after and hadn't been swept off my feet with the service. The rooms are very overpriced and nothing to write home about. In comparision with the Hilton where you pay $90approx per night to the Oriental of $2200 per night (not including tax) the rooms aren't that different. To rip you off even more you have to pay to access the internet in your room (I would think for $2200 a night I should be able to access my emails for free).The hotel is a complete rip off, food is nothing special, the rooms are very standard, staff seem to have their minds on other things rather than looking after the guest and I would never stay there again. I contacted Manderin Oriental to explain all of the above, even filling out their post holiday questionnaire - I still haven't received a response. (perhaps the people who deal with customer complaints are busy eating my strawberries and drinking my champagne)"
109,1870,"Aug 2 2006 	Great Place to Stay	Just returned from our 7 days stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Let me first start with the good points.1. The Chaffeur were there and very courteous. The moment our taxi stopped at the front of the hotel, they opened the door, wished us a hearty welcome!2. Went to the 35th floor and what a great view of the skyline from the lobby.3. The turn down service was great. 4. We actually booked for twin bed deluxe room, but it wasn't available and they upgraded us to King Bed- Hudson River View room for the same rate. - I am not complaining. Had a great view room on the 53rd floor.5. The bathroom had a great view of the Hudson river. Enjoyed the Flat Panel TV both in the room as well as in the bathroom.6. Walking distance to all the attractions. Took the subway at 59th street subway right in front of the hotel to South Ferry station (15 - 20 mts.) and roamed around Financial District, Ferry to Statue of Liberty etc., No need to rent a car.7. It was HOT and HUMID and we were always provided and asked for bottled water.Now to the other aspect...The day before we departed, the trash was placed in a plastic bag and was left in the bathroom and was never picked up until we left. It could be the person who did the room cleaning forget to take the trash - but shouldn't happen in a five star hotel. Except for this one incidence, our stay was great. Btw, there are plenty of restaurants in Broadway, 7th, 8th, 6th, 5th, and at the Lincoln center (which is also at a walking distance) where you can find great food at better cheaper price.I will definitely stay here again."
110,1870,"Jul 24 2006 	New York state of mind	Had hesitations about staying at the Mandarin Oriental after reading some of the lukewarm reviews. But stayed there in July for 5 nights, booked 2 Central Park suites and 2 Deluxe rooms. Our group of 8 all found the service, accommodations and the location outstanding. Stunning decor, exceptional friendly service, especially since we had a few preteens and teens in tow. Perfect location above Columbus Circle shops wth access to Whole Foods, restaurants, bakeries, book stores etc. The hotel provided complimentary full English breakfasts every day and we found the service exceptionally attentive. We have stayed at many of the top resorts in the world that have been recommended by Cond Naste, in Europe, Asia, French Polynesia etc. and we would definitely count the Mandarin Oriental as a great hotel."
111,1870,"Jul 6 2006	Could be ok but isn't in the end	Stayed there for 5 nights - maybe one of the last with central park view: there's another skyscraper growing taking the sight!Room was modern and comfy, service was fivestar.A bad surprise was the airport-transportation service. The ordered Mercedes was $180, they wanted to charge $250. At checkout they told us they will clear it before booking the creditcard with the extra $70. 2 weeks later they charged the creditcard with the 70 bucks without asking! So be careful when booking with them."
112,1870,"Jun 23 2006	Lovely room nice staff but security problems	I have stayed at the Mandarin in different cities many times but was particularly excited about staying at the property in New York. The staff are wonderful and this is reflected in the service from the moment you enter and woosh up to the lobby on the 35th floor. I requested a non-smoking room only to enter my room and discover that someone had obviously been smoking in the room. The staff responded immediately and relocated me to another room. The room and the amenities were wonderful. The food from in room dining was delivered on time and was exceptional as was my dining experience in the restaurant. Now onto one serious problem. Twice during my stay, someone with a key tried to get into my room. The second time, the force was so great that it literally tore the bolts off the security bar on the door. The hotel did respond and were very apologetic -- but the experience was VERY unsettling. I was compensated for the trouble but left rather shaken. I suppose this could happen in any hotel, the fact that it happened at a property that demands in excess of $700 per night for a room is really disappointing. On a positive note, the hotel acted swiftly, apologized and did all of the right things in the face of the circumstances. I was more than satisfied with how they handled the situation. I would return to this property -maybe with a body guard! -- if only for the wonderful staff -- especially bellman Robert."
113,1870,"Jun 10 2006	One Night Anniversary Treat	My wife and I live in Brooklyn and for our 2nd anniversary we decided to spend a night in the city at a top hotel. We decided on the Mandarin because we have never even been to the Time Warner center and knew the Mandarin was the newest luxury hotel in the city. While the prices were way high we decided if we are going to do this lets go all out. When we booked the room there was a glitch in the pricing system and all rooms were going for $166. We decided to book right away and see if they would honor it. They did not but did offer up upgrades in class of room if we bought a standard rate. We did this and got a premiere Central Park view room for standard room price - still thats $750 for one night. We also got 20% discount on all spa activities although we had no plans on doing that.We checked in Friday at 3pm - took the elevator to the 35th floor to the elegant lobby. Our room was ready and check in was very fast. We then took the guest-only elevators (key cards required to operate) to our room on the 52 floor. The floor hallways are very tastefully done, best I have ever seen, and we proceeded to our room.The room was also very elegantly designed and felt very new. While the room was not large the bed was quite comfortable as was the large ottoman by the window. The view was great although obstructed by the Trump Hotel across the street. Still we could see most of the park and up Central Park South - quite attractive. The bathroom was big. We loved the soaking tub and the shower which has a rainshower feature where the water comes pouring out of a large multi-hole showerhead fixed in the ceiling.When I booked I informed the reservations agent it was our anniversary and the hotel delivered complimentary champagne, cake and chocolates that evening - a very thoughtful gesture that made us feel special.In the afternoon we used the pool which is nice but more for doing laps than relaxing but still there was only one person in it besides us so we enjoyed the 30 minutes we stayed.As an extra treat we saw Lance Armstrong in the elevator on our way to dinnerThe bed was very comfortable for sleeping that night.The next morning we had room service deliver breakfast. This was the only major disappointment of the stay. The eggs were watery and a glass of apple juice was $8 EACH!. We should have bought apple juice at the Duane Reade across the street and kept it for the morning. The $70 breakfast was not worth it.All in all while this was a very expensive 24 hours but as a one-time-only treat we had a great time and felt adequately pampered. Im sure there are better hotels values in NYC but I'm not sure they can all provide the same level of luxury."
114,1870,"May 23 2006	Sublime Hotel	Me and my wife stayed at the Mandarin for our honeymoon in April. What can I say apart from it is fantastic. We stayed in the central park suite on the 46th floor and had a great view overlooking central park and the hudson river. For $2300 a night you would expect a slightly bigger room, but this is NY and space is limited, but we werent disappointed. I had read some reviews saying some of the rooms looked worn, but ours looked fine. It was modern with a flat screen tv is every room including the bathroom. There was plenty of wardrobe space and the bed was extremely comfortable. The service was great and the food was worth every penny. The breakfast is very expensive but I had gone for the B&amp;B option when booking which is advisable. The gym is adequate but would you want anymore while on holiday. All in all, I could not fault the Mandarin and they made our honeymoon even better espeically with touches like free champagne, cakes and chocolates."
115,1870,"Apr 10 2006 	A Satisfying Experience	Being a self-made millionaire, through investments and other means, I am accustomed to fine hotels. This one was a typical classy hotel. I was attending a meeting in NYC with some investor, millionaire friends of mine and stayed at one of the most luxurious rooms here. It was spot-on. The bar was a great place to meet others who have achieved success. I give it a B+."
116,1870,"Apr 7 2006	Lovely but could be better.	My husband and I stayed at the Mandarin Orient in Columbus Circle in December. The hotel is lovely. However, a few glitches decreased our satisfaction. The hotel lost our reservation but was able to accomodate us. The bath tub didn't work! A serviceman spent an hour in our room trying to fix it and never could. The hotel didn't even offer to reduce the rate or send an apologetic fruit basket. If you are a shopper, the adjacent mall is nice. I would probably not stay here again, there are too many nice hotels in NY with working tubs."
117,1870,"Mar 23 2006	Fantastic Hotel!	The views of the city are dramatic, the hotel decor extremely elegant, tasteful, and peaceful. The corner room with view of the Hudson River and king bed was not huge, but well-designed and suited our needs perfectly. Opulent bathroom with tub and rain shower, only one sink. Lounge for drinks with seating reserved for hotel guests has a beautiful view of the city, as does the excellent restaurant Asiate. The staff were warm, polite, efficient, no attitude whatsoever, room service was fast. Excellent location, convenient to the theater district (10-15 minute walk, no time by cab) and directly across from Central Park, located at the brand new Time Warner center (a nice mall) on the renovated Columbus Circle. My first choice among New York hotels. Sleep with your curtains open--when you wake up at night, you get a glimpse of the galaxy of city lights and in the morning the rosy light of dawn on the east faces of the buildings and on the shore of New Jersey."
118,1870,"Feb 21 2006	Great hotel with a few problems.	My wife and I are big fans of Mandarin Oriental, so naturally, we chose this for our most recent trip to NYC.The hotel itself is gorgeous, with fantastic views, decoration, furnishings, restaurant, and location. We could not have faulted anything.The corner hudson view room had great floor to ceiling views, though it was not very big. There were two flat screen TVs (one in the bathroom), and great style. Unfortunately, it looked like someone had a big party in the room right before we got there as there was a big stain right in the middle of the carpeting, and one of the TVs plastic casing was cracked/chipped. As we had already unpacked by the time we noticed this... we just let it go.The lobby is beautiful, and the food/wine at Asiate (restaurant) are first rate. Added bonus of Columbus Circle location is that you don't need to leave the building for some of the top restaurants in NYC (Per Se, Masa, etc...).In summary, a very luxurious and stylish hotel, with good service and fine food. I assume that all the other rooms were in much better shape than ours, as this is a relatively new hotel.Obviously, it is extremely expensive, but for the most part, worth the money."
119,1870,"Feb 20 2006	Blizzard of 2006!	We stayed at the hotel for 7 nights for the special of $500 a night in a room on the 49th floor, we were there for the record breaking snow fall of 26.9 inches of snow and it was fantastic!! Central Park was right across the street and everyone was in a fun loving,snow ball fight kind of mood. We asked if there were any upgrades avaliable however the hotel was booked solid, please take advantage of the one time free &quot;Welcome coffee service&quot; in your room as you arrive. Everymorning you can walk to Starbucks right across the street for your java OR enter the Time warner building which is connected to the Mandarin and stop in at the Borders books/Dean and Deluca for coffee and great big doughnuts from the Doughnut plant or Choc and almond Croissants from Balthazar's bakery.The fitness room is great and there is no extra fee attached to use the room.The restaurant and bar area have amazing views!! In the bar area they serve light lunches, brk and afternoon tea. Drinks will run you at least $17 each, bar menu looked great as well with mini burgers and a bento box.We did eat dinner once at the restaurant, food was very good, not exceptional but the view was outstanding!The staff and service was great, never snobby or pretencious. There is a house car avaliable on a first come basis that will take you up to a mile from the hotel.We did see 2 celebrities, couldn't miss one of them she was wearing a bright red coat on Valentines day.Each night you recieve 2 bottles of Fuji water ,chocolates, and two small fruits like plums or dates with turn down service.DO check your hotel bill when checking out there were 2 overbills of dinner bills charged to our room which were not ours adding up to $300.00.Great memories indeed!!"
120,1870,"Jan 30 2006	Best Ever	I stayed here for my 21st birthday for 4 nights and it was the best ever! At check-in we got a room upgrade to a corner room on the top floor over looking the Hudson River - amazing! I also arrived to a lovely little cake and small bottle of champagne which was great!I have stayed in New York before but this just exceeded my expectations. Would definately stay there next time I visit.Beautiful hotel, excellent room views and great location. What more could you want!!"
121,1870,Jan 13 2006	Luxuriousexquisitespolit me for life!	We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental at the end of June for 2 nights to celebrate my husband's 40th.The hotel is without doubt the most amazingly beautiful hotel that I have stayed in and will take some beating. I can't believe it's ranked so low! From the outside it's a breathtaking shiny tower and inside well... even better. The lift whisks you up to reception and the lobby with the most amazing central park views. We had a Central Park view room which although quite small was the height of luxury. The bed was quite the most luxurious and comfortable bed to stay awake half the night with jet lag in! The bathroom was beautiful with the most amazing dinner plate sized shower head - I was actually giggling at the sheer deliciousness of this place whilst showering! The whole hotel is an amazing blend of East meets West and the spa is a great example of this.It is styled in a beautiful Oriental way and yet with every turn of the head there are amazing views of the Manhattan skyline.Finally - for the best burgers you'll ever taste go to the lobby of the Parker Meridian hotel and behind the curtain is an authentic burger joint!
122,1870,"Jan 12 2006	Brilliant Hotel expensive but great - the spa might not suit you though	This is a great hotel, the best I have ever stayed in, the rooms are finished to a very high standard and have everything you could ever need and a few things you don't - but here is one thing I wished I had known before I went. The hotel partly sells itself on its spa, which is one of the best in New York I think. When I booked I presumed that guests of the hotel could use the spa, ie the fancy showers and steam room etc - but when we arrived I found that you cannot use the spa unless you have a treatment, such a massage or facial etc which costs a minimum of $190 per person. However - if they are not busy in the spa a hotel guest can use the facilities at a cost of $50 per person. Not too bad. But all the facilities are separate for men and women, so if you are going with a husband or boyfriend, you won't be able to go in together. They should make all this clear on their website - but they don't.I wouldn't have rejected this hotel if I had known all this but it helps to be informed. I was disappointed that I couldn't use the spa with my husband and that I had to pay extra.However, all is not lost, if you don't want or can't afford a treatment, you can use the hotel pool and fitness centre, which are separate from the spa. The pool is lovely with views over the river and long too, 25 meters. There is a very small sauna in each of the male and female changing rooms.The bar at the reception is lovely, with a view over columbus circle and central park.After all my moaning, I'd go again!"
123,1870,"Jan 10 2006	Very expensive very nice	My husband and I stayed at the Mandarin for four days in early December. We found the hotel to be well-located, the staff kind and efficient, the decor pleasing, and the views spectacular. Yes, it was expensive, even outrageously expensive, but we've paid nearly as much elsewhere and not received the same value for the dollar spent. Our room, while not large, was immaculate and very comfortable. The view out the window was amazing and better yet, we heard absolutely no noise from outside. We thought it was a nice touch that the maitre d' in the lounge reserves tables for hotel guests so that even if the bar is packed, there's a table waiting for you. The air is a bit thick with the smell of money and celebrities (we saw Bono there) but we felt we were being treated just as well. I wished we could have stayed longer, and I would definitely go back. The Mandarin came to feel very much like home during the time we were there."
124,1870,"Jan 7 2006	Well worth the expense!	Having been a regular at the Plaza, NYC on previous visits to the Big Apple, I was keen to find a hotel that would live up to our always high expectations. I was recommended the MOH by a friend and booked two rooms directly with the hotel. I later discovered the somehwat mixed reviews on this site and had even thought that it might have been an idea to cancel and stay at another hotel. However my worries were unfounded and I can report our stay to have been outstanding in every way. We were staying for five nights (at $700 per room per night) and were upgraded to central park suites on the 54th floor (highest floor available). Although maybe not the largest rooms in NYC the views were breathtaking and resulted in us sleeping with the curtains open just to admire the once in a lifetime views. The staff are a credit to the company and the concierge was able to obtain great seats to the Fiddler on the Roof at 24 hours notice and excellent dinner reservations at Cipriani. Each morning every single staff member greeted us with a smile and a good morning welcome. The rooms were always kept well stocked and clean. We ate at Asiate (twice), and althought the food is not maybe the best in the world it is excellent and well worth a go if only for the views. The bar, although small, mixes a great cocktail and is a great place to people watch.All in all I cannot rate this hotel highly enough and it will take alot for it to be beaten in my mind."
125,1870,"Jan 4 2006	Loved everything about the Mandarin except the outrageous price!	I would love to write a glowing, wonderful review of the Mandarin, except I cannot. I can praise the location, which cannot be beat. I was able to walk to the park, midtown, upper east side and upper west side. Especially the easy access to the shopping in the Time Warner Bldg. The hotel is spectacular. Our room was spacious and luxurious. I loved the plasma TV in the bathroom, and our view of the Hudson River from the 40th floor was gorgeous. The bed was so comfortable and the room was immaculate. Check-in was quick and easy, as was check-out. We always had a taxi waiting outside for us if we needed it.My problem is the price. I paid about $600 per night and basically got a great room, with a great view, at a great location. For that kind of money, I expect a little extra in terms of service. For that price, I would like a conceirge lounge with beverages and light snacks. I would also like to make a massage appointment that does not cost $280 for a 1 hour massage! Room service would have been nice, but pancakes and coffee for $50 per person? I am not a stranger to luxury hotels, nor am I a stranger to the NY area. I have stayed at other Mandarins, Ritz-Carltons and Four Season's, and I lived in NY for 20 years, but these prices even shocked me! If you have the money to burn, this is the place to stay, otherwise, you may want to read some other reviews, before making a reservation."
126,1870,"Dec 27 2005	Good Views Bad Service	Stayed in one of the Central Park Suites....The suite did not have much space for the price, don't get me wrong it was not small, but for $2,100 a night, I expected a larger living room and bathroom. Room service takes forever as does check-in.. Also the hotel charged me twice for room service, had to get it taken off my credit card..Next time I think we will stay at the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South."
127,1870,"Dec 9 2005	Service was ok but disgusting room	This was our 3rd stay a t the Mandarin Oriental and we could not believe the condition of the rooms, the sofa chairs and cushion covers within our room where so dirty and stained you would have thought they had been dragged through the park. The sofas where changed after we complained but they should never allow a room to be occupied in this condition. The staff at the hotel we polite and always friendly, but they have real maintenance issues which need to be resolved quickly."
128,1870,Dec 8 2005 	A Disgrace to the name Mandarin Oriental	This hotel does not belong in the Mandarin Oriental Group.The rooms may be beautiful but one needs more from a hotel.The service is a disgrace. The management are totallly disinterested and disingenuous. Letters are simply ignored.Beware on prices this hotel has so many different rates for the same category accommodation even the staff do not know what to charge!It would be a disaster to stay here. In a city filled with top class hotels you do not need to go here.
129,1870,Dec 2 2005	Service was horrible	Stay away from this Hotel.VERY BAD service - Don't mind paying $1200 for a room but expect a level of service for that rate.Waiting 15 min outside the airport for the car from the hotel to arrive.Breakfast from room service arriving without cutlery - food cold when it did arrive.Next morning - room service over one hour tweenty minutes to arrive.Not what I would expect from Mandarin Oriental.
130,1870,"Nov 21 2005	Mandarin Oriental - Absolutely Perfect!!!!!!	What can I say?? Everything at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York was perfect - the staff was so accommodating, helpful and courteous. The room was beautiful - the hotel lobby bar marvelous!!! I did not want to go home. I cannot wait to stay there again."
131,1870,"Nov 12 2005	Stay away from the spa	I booked two rooms for myself and three of my girlfriends over a weekend. I asked for early check-ins but received one regular check-in and one very late check-in (4:30 pm). The rooms were fine but had obstructed views (Hudson River) even though I booked higher elevation rooms for a better view. The room was quite small as was the bathroom in comparison to the Four Seasons New York. We all had massages in their spa which was a very disappointing experience. The masseuse was late, there was no tour, overhead music problems, and no bed available for the rest area following the massage (and I spent over $1300 for the massages). The massage which lasted two hours was alright but not great. I would save my money and stay somewhere else or opt for the Four Seasons New York."
132,1870,"Nov 8 2005 	Confirmed: Top pick	Stayed for the second time within a 2 months time frame. This time, I booked a standard room. Upon arriving, was welcomed very heartly and got a better room, at the 54th level. The view of the Hudson River out of my bath tub was amazing.Breakfast was fresh and tasty, the pool is a must see/must do. The bed is heavenly, the entertainment system in the room is unique. Turn down service is great with little attentions like cards with wise words on them. But also cookies and a big bottle of Fiji water. The concierge services are top.Last time I was in the elevator with William Shatner, this time in front was P. Daddy. Once again, a 9.5/10 and if you can book a promotional rate or package, go for it."
133,1870,"Nov 5 2005	beautiful hotel!!!	We stayed 4 nights at the Mandarin in a Grand Deluxe Room, the room was just beautiful and the view spectacular. The highlight was the Rain Shower, it will put you right to sleep at night. The bath tub was also a delight with a view window from the room as well and the beds are so soooo comfortable. We ordered room service our first night and it was quite yummy. My friend mentioned it was her birthday and that day we had the most amazing cake sent up to the room. Service was over the top and we did have a couple of Celebrity sightings getting on the elevators. The lobby is to die for, make sure you go and have a night cap in the lobby bar.I am already planning for might return trip in June next year."
134,1870,"Oct 10 2005 	Great location small room not great value	A great location, good service (through not up to the normally high standards of other Mandarin Oriental hotels), Very small room for the price (though well laid out- Room fine for one person would have been too small for two and was supposedly an executive suite?) Felt the room was too expencive for what it was Much better values elsewhere in New York. Would only stay here again if I needed to be close to Lincoln Center and was on a tight schedule"
135,1870,"Sep 25 2005	On The ""Value for the money"" Scale The WORST Hotel I Ever Stayed In	I see myself as a high end guest, having stayed in Four Seasons, Ritz-Carltons, and other top properties worldwide. Some (but obviously not all) hotels will charge $400 - $500 and up because they offer an exceptional setting, environment, service level, or something else that makes them a cut above the rest. If you see yourself ready to spend $500+ a night for a transcendental experience at the the Mandarin Oriental New York, I have one word for you: &quot;PASS!&quot; My Central Park &quot;view&quot; room, including the ludicrous local taxes that added $100+ a night, was $800! For this I got a spectactular view of.... the Trump monstrosity across the street. This hotel stay was easily the worst - and OK, the stupidest - hotel decision I ever made. The rooms are expensively furnished, but not enough so to justify the price. The windows don't open. A chicken sandwich from room service with a soda will cost you $39. Sure, you have convenient access to the mall and the Whole Foods downstairs, but why not stay a half a block away on Central Park South for HALF the money? We moved out early, and went to the &quot;W&quot; on Park Avenue near Union Square, and had a lovely and HUGE room in a wonderul area (near the Village, SoHo, TriBeCa) for about half what we paid at the Mandarin. The Mandarin in my view is strictly for business people on an expense account, which, come to think about it, appears to be the demographic of the guests anyway. This was a &quot;once n a lifetime&quot; splurge to be sure, because I guarantee I am never coming back unless someone pays me to stay."
136,1870,"Sep 13 2005	Excellent honeymoon destination	We recently travelled to New York for the third time and stayed at the Mandarin Oriental. As this was our honeymoon we wanted something really special and the hotel did not dissapoint us.We ordered a car to take us to and from the airport - both drivers were extremely courteous and helpful. However we were quite surprpised that not only had we been overcharged on the price we had been quoted from the Mandarin Orientals website but we had also been charged an extra fee for 'waiting time' after we had gotten of the plane. As the car was $300 already, to be charged an extra $50 was quite a shock. We admit that it took an hour and a half to clear immigration (not our fault) and were willing to pay some extra charge however it appeared that we were expected to be at the car the second our flight had landed as thats when the over charging began! They did not even give us any time at all to clear immigration. After some complaining, the hotel did stick to the original quote but were not willing to budge on the waiting time and we ended up paying waiting time from the moment our flight landed! This was the only thing with potential to spoil the holiday.We had booked a premier corner hudson river view room as we had been told that some park views were obscured. The room was lovely, bright and clean, the view excellent - on the 52nd floor. The bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in!The staff were friendly and courteous at all times and made our stay a very pleasant one. The turn down service was good and the flowers and proverbs left on our pillow were a nice touch - as were the biscuits and water!The views from the Lobby Lounge were excellent and we spent many an hour relaxing with great views. Service here was great. We did not eat in Asiete despite being charged three times for someone else's meal - however this was easily resolved with a telephone call.The pool was also lovely however with only four loungers a little on the small side. The TVs in all the machines in the gym make exercising a lot easier!The hotel is very expensive - drinks in particular as well as some of the food for what it was but we had a brilliant time - and as it was our honeymoon we were willing to pay these kinds of prices.All in all we felt pampered, happy and not at all patronised. We were very sad to leave the luxury and stunning views.We loved the Mandarin Oriental so much that we are now looking to try the one in Bermuda next year!"
137,1870,"Sep 1 2005	An Oasis In Manhattan	The hotel occupies the upper floors at the Time Warner center and has stunning views of the city and New Jersey. The location is a short walk from Lincoln Center, boutique shopping on Madison Avenue, and Broadway theater. We booked a corner suite with living room views of Central Park and bedroom views of both the park and hudson river. The room was absolutely perfect. Mandarin has installed flat screen, HD TV's with HD programing in each room and they are a treat. Floor to ceiling glass walls in both rooms make for incredible views. The restaurant is wonderful and has stunning central park views that soak in the morning sun. I can't think of a better place to have a leisurely breakfast. The lobby lounge can become crowded and is a bit too small to handle the demand so patrons overflow into a cramped, uncomfortable bar area during peak pre-theater hours. The bar is one of the few missteps and drinks are outrageously expensive, even by Manhattan hotel standards. On crowded evenings, the staff limits seating in the lounge to registered guests only, but there is still an occasional waiting list. The spa may be Manhattan's best (but book ahead) and the large lap pool is not to be missed. It's as if you are swiming along the Hudson. I've stayed at top hotels around the globe, many in New York, and this property is among the best."
138,1870,"Sep 1 2005	Nice views absurd prices	Unfortunately, as it develops its brand, Mandarin Oriental doesn't seem able to produce hotels that come anywhere near the charm of the original Oriental in Bangkok. Their New York hotel is a case in point. Arriving, no one bothered to accompany us to the lifts that go to reception on the 35th floor and we weren't escorted to our room either. Worst of all, this place is very, very noisy, with awful vibrating sounds coming from the lifts and party noise from other rooms and reception areas. Staff have a nose-in-the-air attitude and prices for all services are too high even by New York standards. With hotels like the Caryle and the Four Seasons to chose from, this place had better pull up its socks."
139,1870,"Aug 28 2005	A bit too stuffy for us	My sister and I stayed here for one night and a half day of spa services. We were looking forward to our stay at MO, since we have heard so many great things about the spa and hotel. We went with the AMEX platinum card and breakfast and lunch were included in our stay. We were also told that we would have an upgrade if one was available, but it wasn't.Checking in was swift and we were asked if we wanted tea to our room, which we obliged (However, tea never arrived, and we had to call to remind them hours later about it).Upon entering our room we had two single beds and a corner room away from elevators, exactly what we asked for (we told them that we were noise sensitive). The view was breathless. Nice view of river and NYC. However, we quickly noticed that the hotel room across the hall from us was under construction and they were using a table saw which was deafening. We quickly called the front desk to try to rectify the situation, and unfortunately received unprofessional responses. Basically the woman at the front desk said according to her computer there is no construction across the hall from us, so I held up the phone and asked if she could hear the saw that was blaring and she said &quot;no&quot;. I felt as if she were calling me a liar. In any event, she said there were &quot;no rooms to move us to&quot; and we needed to &quot;wait 20 minutes, if it doesn't stop, then call us back&quot;. I thought this was awful customer service for a hotel that is charging me $549 a night. We waited over 40 minutes, the saw did not stop, so we called again, this time we were a bit more aggressive, and a manager came up and &quot;investigated&quot; and made them stop. We then went to lunch at the lounge before the spa, it was pleasant. Service prompt and professional. Food was good. The highlight of our trip was the spa. It was an event that I will remember for a long time. The steam and whirlpool they offer before and after your treatments were divine. Towels, water, lavender infused cold towels and fresh flowers were everywhere. Meticulously clean. We had a general Swedish Massage and Shirodhara (oil and scalp massage). It was very nice. Relaxation room with private beds after treatments, with tea were heavenly. We went back into the steam before we left just because it was that amazing (generally I am not one for a steam room, but this was over the top!).After treatments, we decided to grab food at the Whole Foods market and call it an early night in the room with a movie. Great selection of foods there and a LOT less expensive! They came for turn down service after 10pm which I thought was too late for that service, but hey, its NY, and who is in bed at 10pm on a Friday night except us?Breakfast the next morning was good. Service again, very professional. However, upon returning to the room after breakfast, the infamous &quot;table saw&quot; was in full gear across the hall. Oh well.Overall, the Mandarin Oriental in MY opinion is a place to see and be seen. We had several celebrity sightings while there, and although our bill for one night with spa services came to over $1800, we couldn't help but to feel like staff and management viewed us as &quot; the common folk&quot;. Even though the hotel and spa were wonderful, we were never made feel truly &quot;welcomed and pampered&quot;. It always felt just a tad too stuffy for us. I think from now on we will stay with our usual addresses like Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton."
140,1870,"Aug 11 2005	Left early....	I was very excited to stay at the Mandarin Oriental. I was looking forward to staying somewhere (anywhere!!) besides the Four Seasons on 57th which is our usual home in NYC, and I was hoping that we'd spend more time in the park given the location. We requested a one bedroom suite with a view of Central Park. There are probably some great things about the MO but the negatives led us to check out after our first evening.The good:Location! Across the street from the park, and above a shopping complex. I was very excited that the Whole Foods market was underneath us...just in case we needed something. Unfortunately, since we left the hotel early, I didn't get to check out the shopping.I also liked the Chihuly glass sculpture and paintings in the hotel lobby.Staff was great. And, I loved that they brought hot tea to our room after our arrival and had a beautiful assortment of cookies, fruit, and chocolate welcoming us to our room.Gift books, reading glasses, lap blankets, chaise lounge in the bedroom...there were many wonderful and thoughtful touches in the suite.The bad:The room. It was small and cold. Yes, it was a one bedroom suite, but it was not at all spacious. It felt like a long rectangular space with partitian walls dividing the bath from the bedroom and the bedroom from the living room. The &quot;look&quot; of the room and the furniture was fantastic. Straight out of Metropolitan Home. But, on closer inspection everything was very cheaply made, and the furniture was insubstantial and uncomfortable. The club chairs were so light that I (120 lbs) could slide one back simply by sitting down. The bathroom cabinetry was also poorly made, and the interiors of the cabinets were unfinished (exposed unpainted drywall). It was worse than a cheap track home. I don't make a habit of acting like a building inspector, but I was in the cabinets looking for a place to store my things. Did I mention there was little closet space? My clothes took most of the closet space....my husband never did get unpacked.The overall feeling in the room was cold, in part because of the wood floors with area rugs. Since there was little area, the rugs were under the furniture, so we were always walking on a cold floor.Great plasma TV, but the movie channel or the TV was not operating properly. The picture repeatedly disappeared for 5-10 minutes at a time leaving only the sound. Not good for &quot;watching&quot; a movie about dancing! No one could help, although someone tried to....right away. They didn't charge for the movie.The food. We ended up eating dinner at the lounge that evening after getting settled in the room. It was a little too dark for dinner, and the service was weak. Some of the menu items were great, others poor. I realized that I was trying too hard to enjoy the meal as my husband was obviously having trouble warming to this hotel.The next morning we packed up and went back to the Four Seasons. For the same price we returned to our one bedroom suite there, that in comparison to the suite at the Mandarin Oriental, is more like a house. Hallways leading to the various rooms, &quot;real&quot; furniture, wall to wall carpet, a phenomenal master bath (nothing unfinished about these rooms!) At the Four Seasons suite, everything feels as good as it looks.I would never even try to stay at the MO again. I have no idea how the other rooms compare, but the deluxe, one bedroom suite was not worth the money, nor did it compare to the luxury of the Four Seasons."
141,1870,Jul 8 2005	Great Hotel Great Location	We just recently stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for three nights. My best advice is to book as far in advance as possible to secure a decent rate. I got a Hudson View Room on the 38th floor for 429.00 per night and it was a great value. The room was small but the amenities and ambiance made up for it. The bathroom was fantastic with the rainshower shower a real treat. The shower was one of the largest I have ever seen. Above all the hotel was very quiet and spotlessly clean. I will only stay at this hotel in New York in the future. The lobby is very nice with the wonderful views of Central Park. Staff were very professional and unobtrusive.
142,1870,Jul 4 2005	Loved this place	I love this place. Will go back again. It beats the Trump Intl Hotel and Tower around the corner where the 'rents usually stayed in years past.
143,1870,"May 27 2005 	Simply the best...	While on business in New York, I had the distinct pleasure of staying at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel New York. After one of my greatest hotel experiences, I only hope that in the near future I will be able to grace the hotel once again. I arrived at 10PM, very tired after a long flight, and the entire hotel staff was gracious and helpful, getting me up to my room, with a quick tour of the room and a reassurance that if I needed anything, the front desk was only a call away, I gladly went to sleep. I didnt get much of a chance to explore the city itself, but the view from my room gave me a glimpse of what the city has to offer.I even got a chance to try out the spa. Situated on the 35th floor of the hotel, the views were simply breathtaking. The treatments were both relaxing and rejuvenating.I definitely recommend the Mandarin Oriental! Although I only stayed for 3 days, the experience was certainly worth it."
144,1870,"May 13 2005	Magical Mandarin	The street level entrance does not prepare you for the sight you experience when you reach the small but spectacular lobby with views over Central Park.Choose a room on the highest floor you can get; you will be rewarded with breathtaking views over the Park, City or Hudson. We stayed in a Hudson Deluxe River View Room; the room is beautifully appointed but at 450 square feet is small in comparison with rooms at a similar price ($800) in , say, the Ritz Carlton or the Four Seasons.The bathroom, overlooking the River , is rather lovely.Breakfast in Asiate was a treat. Choose the Mandarin for the charm of the staff and the bedroom decor but above all for the magical views in every direction.The trilogy of the Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental ; who needs a better excuse to visit NYC?"
145,1870,"May 9 2005	Fantastic!!	Absolutly fantastic hotel in perfect location,we stayed in a Deluxe Hudson River view on the 47 floor with view overlooking the west of Manhattan and Hudson River.We stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute of our stay.The rooms are huge and the bathrooms amazing,huge marble shower with rainforest shower head certainly wakes you up in the morning.We used the gym and pool which were great and The Lobby Lounge is a great place for drinks and food with the most amazing view of Central Park.All the staff were very friendly and we can't wait to stay there again."
146,1870,"May 1 2005	loved it all	We just returned, and I loved this hotel. We had a room on the 50th floor, excellent view. They brought us complimentary tea. We loved the gym and lap pool. The food and service were great. Since the hotel is next door to the Time Warner shops, we went to Whole Foods for more great food. The hotel supplies you with Fiji water everywhere. Nice because those annoying mini bars are so expensive for water. This was the first time I ever stayed in NYC and could not hear the traffic below..Would return again."
147,1870,"Apr 15 2005	Cant wait to return	What a fantastic hotel. We had a Central Park View Suite and a connecting Double Room to accommodate our family. We were afforded rooms on the 54th floor with spectacular views over Central Park and Broadway looking to towards Times Square.From the moment we arrived all staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs, the hotel worked well with our two children. Upon entering our room gifts were waiting on the childrens beds. Along with child friendly toiletries, child bath robes and slippers We used the hotel restaurant for breakfast each day during our stay and the service was exceptional along with the quality of the food. We also had a complementary lunch as part of our package which was as equally as good.The concierge team are fantastic; they were able to accommodate every request we had.In summary the hotel offers discreet, attentive service whilst anticipating your needs.Mandarin Oriental is now one of New Yorks finest and most expensive hotels after a shaky bedding in period."
148,1870,"Apr 14 2005	Great Hotel	I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental over the Easter weekend in a Grand Double Deluxe on the 53rd floor. Unlike some reviewers I thought that the room was big and mine had great views down the Hudson river. The bathroom was huge and well equipped, unlike some of the smaller bathrooms you find in older hotels. There was a large walk in wardrobe with more that sufficient room to store suitcases. I found all of the staff to be extremely welcoming, courteous and helpful. The views from Asiate are exceptional and the perfect way to start a New York morning, and the breakfast options were extensive and filling. The hotel's location in the Time Warner Centre is a bonus as there are a number of really good restaurants there. I ate in the V Steakhouse - and enjoyed a really good meal with good service. I suppose that the hotel is expensive - but no more so than any equivalent 5* hotel which provides a similar level of luxury care. It's certainly on my shortlist of hotels to stay in whenever I go back to NYC."
149,1870,"Feb 24 2005	Small room great view.	Small room, great view. I had a deluxe double with a fabulous view of theHudson river. The room was nicely furnished, but quite small. In fact thebathroom door didn't shut because the chest of drawers blocked it. The room was nicely kitted out and the sheets divine. Even the bath had a view. But I was surprised by the lack of toiletries provided. This is not a 5 star hotel experience. The restaurant, Asiate, is lovely, but I had a meal so bad I sent it back (they did not charge me full price at least). I had reserved at this hotel to be near The Gates and did have a nice view of the Park from the Lobby Lounge and Asiate (not my room)."
150,1870,"Feb 8 2005	fabulous hotel fantastic staff	Perfect location, fabulous decor, friendly staff. Went to the spa and was pampered. Lunch at Asiate was excellent. Book a river view room for excellent views. Bathrooms are super luxurious. Highly recommend. I would definitely stay there again!!!"
151,1870,"Jan 24 2005	wonderful experience	My husband and I stayed at the Mandarin the weekend of the of the 15th. The room on the 51st floor was beautiful with a great view of central park/yes the trump bldg was in the middle of the view, butit was still beautiful. Our room was spacious and decorated very nice, the bathroom was excellent, all marble with a deep tub and large shower. We loved the flat screen tv's in the bath and bedroom. The robes were plush and I loved the smell of the bath salts they put in the room. We had drinks in the lounge and brunch in the restaurant. Everyone was most attenive, friendly and helpful. The waiter in the lounge even took time to tell us about all the surrounding buildings and their history, it was very interesting. In the restaurant they gave us a cabana seat which was very private and romantic. The food was excellent. We had room service for breakfast and champagen and strawberries delivered to the room, both were great. I wish we would have had time to try the spa, maybe next time. Now for the only down side. Some of the picing I felt was over the top, the champagne and strawberries were $155, a hamburger was $26. One of the great things about this hotel is it is adjacent to a wonderful shopping area, you do not even have to go outside. In the basement of the shopping center is Great Foods a wonderful grocery store where we bought the same champagne for $35 and a Godiva shop where we bought more chocalate dipped strawberries for $20. I am not complaining, but if you are on a budget you may want to consider this. We went to see Beauty and the Beast which was a wonderful play, took a carriage ride in central park, had drinks at tavern on the green and had a wonderful time. I can not imagine staying any other place, you feel special here and the staff is wonderful, I plan on going back!"
152,1870,"Jan 24 2005	Wonderful suites	We stayed in a suite on the 53rd floor and had views over the Hudson and of Central Park.Upon our arrival we were treated extremely well, and I agree with a previous writer that the Concierge are fantastic.We had a champagne reception for 23 guests in the Lobby lounge on the day of our wedding and were given our our &quot;private&quot; area for our guests to mingle, and the use of the foyer for numerous photo'sFrom start to finish we were taken aback by the way we were treated and will definitely return.If you have the money we highly recommend the hotel."
153,1870,"Jan 13 2005	Great views	We stayed one night at the hotel, the room was small and we had payed extra for a park view. On checking in we where shown to a partial park view and had to argue with the check in desk to be moves(not a good start). It turns out that all park views are mostly parital views and an expensive option to go for. Room service breakfast was good but small in portions we had the continental and by NY standards it left us hungry.Lunch at Asiate was nice and the food tasty. The hotels best service had to be the concierge they bend over backwards and really do all they can. Spa was nice but expensive.We will stay again but go for a suite as we where fed up of tripping over out cases in the room to quote &quot;not enough room to swing a cat&quot;!!!"
154,1870,"Jan 10 2005	Good with kids	Just spent weekend at Mandarin with 2 children: 5 and 8. The hotel worked well for a luxury property and children. They gave children wonderful welcome gifts. The kids loved the views. The indoor pool was a big plus. Also important was that the hotel is connected to the New Time Warner Center and in inclement weather, could stay inside and visit Borders book store and even better, get food and snacks from the Whole Foods store inside. The staff always said hello to the boys by name and always asked them for a high five which they loved. Also, the kids said the chicken fingers were the best.As for adults, lovely, nice food and great views.Very pleased."
155,1870,"Jan 2 2005	Nice but not worth the price	As many other reviewers have commented, my wife and I felt the MO was nice - but not worth the price. We stayed in a &quot;Premier Park View Room,&quot; on the 46th floor for 3 nights over New Year's Eve. Upon walking in the room, the first thing you notice is the gigantic, black Trump Tower that filled 30-40% of the &quot;park view!&quot; The bellman dropped that when the MO opened, Trump hung a banner on his hotel goading guests with a better view -- not surprising.The room was spacious and well equipped. The bed was super comfortable, in the same class as the Heavenly bed at the Westin and W hotels. The electronics (TV, stereo, etc.) were mediocre and had to be rebooted several times during our stay when the TV wouldn't turn on, change channels, etc. A modern Tivo and other components would do a much better job. The bathroom was large and very nice, but only had one sink. Although we were offered tea at check-in, we ordered coffee when we got into the room. The bill was $26 for a small pot!We spent a half-day in the MO Spa, which was fantastic. The VIP room has a private shower, soaking tub, bathroom, day bed and massage tables. The spa service was second to none, and like the hotel, expensive.On NYE, we enjoyed dinner at Asiate, the hotel's restaurant. The initial service was a little slow but picked up through the meal. The food itself was good, not spectacular. The hotel's lounge offers great views of the park and Columbus Circle (they also suffer from being blocked by Trump Tower).Overall, the MO New York doesn't compare well to other 5-star hotels I've been fortunate enough to stay at. They need to sort out the in room electronics and come back down to reality on food and room pricing (to be fair, compared to other NYC hotels we ate at, they are close). The hotel staff from the bellman, to the front desk, to the concierge were courteous throughout our entire stay."
156,1870,"Dec 7 2004	All Staff Were Excellent	What can I say. We stayed and the staff did absolutely everything I would have hoped for and more tomake our stay memorable.Little extras thrown in here and there, a room upgrade, smiles and a friendly helpful attitude throughout. Truely first class, professional service.Agree with some comments I have read about the doorman, or lack there of, but honestly a very small thing.I think some of the other reviews say more about the attitide of the reviewers than they do about the hotel.Loved the hotel, the decor, the view, the staff (and I mean all of them). Oh, and the food and room service was also first class."
157,1870,"Nov 28 2004	**A Diamond In The Rough**	Just spent the weekend at the Mandarin Oriental, and I must say that by most standards, this was the most superb hotel I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. We found the hotel public spaces and room to be an architectural and interior design masterpiece. The designers did a wonderful job of melding the understated, elegant, peaceful asian atmosphere of MO with the vibrant exuberance of NYC. It seemed as if wherever we stood within the hotel, we were treated to the most spectacular views of NYC I have ever seen. Its location within the brand new Time Warner Center is sublime. It gives a whole new dimension to Columbus Circle and the scale and exterior design of the place is awe-inspiring.Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a Premier Hudson View Room, and what a room it was. Beautiful and plush with every amenity imaginable. It was a corner room with sweeping views of the river and city from every vantage point. We could lie in bed and have a perfect view of the Empire State Building directly in front of us. Amenities included plasma TV, DVD CD comprehensive entertainment system with surround sound, deep soaking tub with another great view, separate marble shower with huge rain shower head, minibar with great selection of beverages and Dean &amp; DeLuca goodies, luxe bedding and feather pillows, robes, slippers, Fiji water and fresh flowers at turn down etc.We also had the pleasure of visiting the hotel spa. This was by far the best spa experience I have ever had. Again, the place is beautiful and refined. We were advised to arrive 45 mins early to use the &quot;heat and water experience&quot; which consists of beautiful, separate whirlpool, sauna/steam bath areas for men and women. Then a rest in the co-ed tea lounge and you're off to your treatment. By the time I got to my massage, I was already so relaxed that the transition was seamless. Afterwards, I was escorted to the relaxation room which is yet another exquisite area with daybeds, fountain, refreshments and more spectacular views of NYC.While the young staff was very friendly and tried very hard, I give the hotel less than five stars right now because of some of the gliches they are still having with service. Examples are, waited 40 mins. for our bags to be brought to our room upon check in (called several times and my husband finally had to go down and find them), room service a little slow (however the food was delicious), difficulty getting room service trays removed, turn down service on second night was very late (we were already in bed), minor difficulties with entertainment center that had to be reset on the second day. This and the fact that everything is EXHORBITANTLY expensive keep me from giving this hotel the highest mark. However, given the fact that it is still relatively new and working out the bugs, I am willing to give MO a little more time to become 5 star.Overall, a wonderful (albeit not cheap) hotel experience for any hotel snob."
158,1870,"Nov 23 2004	Very nice but pricey	I just came back from spending 2 nights at the Mandarin Oriental. I only stayed there because it was a last minute trip and there weren't any other 5 star hotels with a decent price. So I decided to splurge and stay at the Mandarin. When the doorman was present, they always opened the door and greeted me everytime. Most of the staff were friendly and always acknowledge me. I only had breakfast at the hotel and the waiter was pretty nice. I had a room with a Central Park and the city view. The only thing that was not so nice was that the Trump Tower was front of it. The room and the bathroom was a decent size and I really enjoyed having the plasma TV in the room and in the bathroom as well. All my room service and turn down service was down on time. I would like to stay here again but the price is just way above most of 5 star hotel in the area."
159,1870,"Sep 15 2004	Read this review- *4 star at best*	All the previous comments are fairly acurate. I believe the reason for the flux in reviews is that the hotel is new, still getting adjusted, although its been operational almost a year. I stayed twice, once in the opening, and my stay this time has improved slightly. There is no one way to go about having a perfect stay at this hotel, because the staff's attitude varies with great degree. Melissa at the concierge desk is an exception, her service is what it should be, warm and efficient. Lobby service is so-so, if you compare it to the breakfast service in Asiate, which is a bomb. Their is a simple lack of communication between managers that I witnessed in both these areas. The bar has a desirable vibe, overpriced drinks as one would expect. Spa is awesome, although overpriced. I know this is NY, but please, $240 for a massage, contribute to inflation a little more please... My next comment would be about the rooms themselves. I received a significant discount on my room, over $1,000-because I pointed out a list on departure-of things that were not meeting my price point. The windows in the rooms do not substitute for the lack of sq. ft. in the room. I ordered room service one night, and the server couldn't even fit the cart of food into the room (the corner of the bed prevented it). Who designed this room I wondered? The bathrooms are among the best I've seen, Mercer being the best in my opinion. Final thought: No need to pay the outrageous published rates, I called this hotel a dozen times, spoke with 5 different people, including Lara who is a manager, and found them guilty in not offering the lowest available rate, when I asked them. This is not a good practice, and Mandarin needs to understand their clients, like me, who don't have time to spend arguing about little negative incidental happenings that come up as a result of under-educating staff, and lack of a clear vision about what a 5-star, 6-star hotel should be in NYC...keep wishing Mandarin, you don't deserve it, at least not yet."
160,1870,"Sep 6 2004	Agree much improved.	We returned to the MO NY this past weekend for a last minute getaway and were quite impressed. We were there soon after opening and agree with prior reviews about the dismal state of the service then. This seems to be mostly taken care of, with a few notable exceptions. The service is still not on par with some similar hotels. For instance, at the Four Seasons SF they always know our names by the time we get to the reception desk and everyone miraculously calls us by name throughout the stay. When my partner returns from runs at the FS SF or Ritz Phili, the doorman will have water and a towel waiting. Service is simply less personal than I would like at the MO. That being said, everyone was very warm and friendly. We booked our room through Platinum Travel (though not the FH&amp;R rate) and were upgraded to a Premier Central Park View room. It was at the end of the hall and shared a vestibule with only one other room (a Premier CP View Suite). As a result, it was very quiet and we did not hear all the door noise other people have complained of. What can be said except that the view of the entire length of Central Park and Mid-town is spectacular. It is unfortunate that even on the highest floor the Trump building partially obscures things, but the view is still quite amazing. Sunrise was great and the reflection of the sunset off the surrounding buildings was also very nice. We have stayed at many of the top hotels in New York and there are few that can provide quality views from the majority of rooms. I also like the aesthetic of the MO more than most top NY hotels, which tend to be too traditional and fussy for me. I found the bed extremely comfortable and the shower was wonderful. The bath products are also very nice, much nicer than at other MO properties. There has been a lot of criticism of the technology in the rooms and complaints that they are too complex. Perhaps it is my younger age and residue of growing up with computers, but it seemd pretty intuitive. The HD LCD TV was great, as was the speaker system. The phone took a few minutes to master, but then it was easy. I also liked that the LCD TV in the bathroom was adjustable. It was odd though that it didn't have all the channels of the larger TV and that the networks were on different channels. On the negative side, the restaurant remains a problem. Though our food was consistent, if not overpriced ($90 for breakfast daily), the service was irregular. They never quite got everything right. We were not served bread the first day, but it came the second day. We were given a small amuse one day, but not the next. I had to ask for butter for my toast. No huge faux-pas, but annoying. Finally, one of the thing I like to do if I like a hotel and think I may come back is to ask for a tour of other room types I might book. They did not seem to know what to do with this request. First I was told no problem. Then the second person to get on the phone told me that it was not possible because not only did nobody have time (!!!!!), but I would need to make an appointment with the front office. What did she think I was, a reporter wanting to do a story? I was a guest, and they should have been happy to show me other rooms. At this time it was 1:30 in the afternoon and she finally said that the only person on staff who could show me around was not going to be back until &quot;this afternoon&quot; and could I stay in my room until she came back. When I informed her that it was already &quot;this afternoon&quot; and asked what she meant she said 2 p.m. Seeing as it was was 30 minutes and I had no plans I said fine. When nobody called me by 2:30 I left for the &quot;afternoon.&quot; Over the course of 2 days they were never able to fulfill my quite simple request. We left without seeing other rooms, something that might have enticed me to spend money for a better room or suite next time. Their loss. It won't stop us from returning, but was an annoying way to end our stay."
161,1870,"Aug 27 2004	Greatly improved since its disastrous opening	This hotel is greatly improved since its disastrous opening. We stayed there in January 2004 and had to change rooms because the first room was uninhabitable but even the second one had its problems. The food and beverage department was in chaos. Room service tea came in coffee pots, or vacuum flasks which had previously contained coffee, or not at all. The chef bought tasteless strawberries and blueberries and called them seasonal berries - in January. On one night the bar was closed because the management had rented the whole place out, apparently to a shoemaker, for a private party.Due to the hotel's eagerness to make amends and the persistence of its guest relations manager, we stayed there again in August 2004. Everything in the room worked, although I was still incapable of mastering the TV system or the cordless phone.The staff seemed more relaxed. The views are wonderful and the beds a delight. The concierge service is excellent but foreigners might like to know that their knowledge of the main European languages, other than English) could be limited.There are still things wrong, of course (the chef continues to have his berry problem, for instance, and one of the staff rendered a check for breakfast with the gratuity line open, when 15% had already been included). They won't be able to do anything about the size of the rooms - not quite big enough - or the size of the closets - very small. If, like my wife, you solve the problem of what to take on vacation by taking everything, consider spending more on a suite because you probably get two closets and more drawers.But the transformation in seven months is to be commended. Housekeeping is world class. Engineering is world class. Staff have a happy and friendly attitude. Clearly some very hard work has been put in to get things right and the Mandarin Oriental is now worth the journey."
162,1870,"Aug 23 2004	The Lobby Lounge	I just came back from a 3-day weekend in NYC with mom. We didn't stay at the Mandarin but decided to walk over to Columbus to check it out after seeing the beautiful pictures and hearing so much about it. Arriving at the 35th floor, I was amazed at how beautiful the place was so we decided to sit down and enjoy a cup of tea and dessert at the Lobby Lounge. We were seated right next to the window and I can't even express how priceless the view was. Dessert was amazing and the staff was so inviting. It was pricey but worth absolutely every penny. This isn't a hotel review but I was so amazed with the experience I had and if you have the time you should really go and try it. You will love the detail that they put into everything. It was a view and dining experience like no other...,very intimate and relaxing. So even if you dont have the money you can still experience what the hotel has to offer to the people that walk through its doors."
163,1870,"Jul 10 2004	Outrageous Price Standard Service	While the hotel is nice, it is VERY VERY overpriced. The &quot;service&quot; was nothing that would justify such high room rates, I would expect much more attentive staff for that rate. Im sorry, but for $595 a night I would expect a HUGE ROOM and LOTS OF AMENITIES. Instead I got a small room on the 45th floor, with a spectacular view, and lots of amenities. A view, flat screen TV, bedside controls, and seperate shower/tub in the bathtroom are not enough for the hotel to charge $595. The room was WAY to small for that price. I would say my room was in the neighborhood of 400 squarefeet. I would say rooms at this hotel are worth AT most $450 a night, if you are paying more than that, stay at the Four Seasons or ST REGIS hotel. Also I was talking to a a man in the elevator who said he booked an &quot;Expedia&quot; rate of $429 a night, and he said his room was overpriced, I would hate to see how small his room was!! LOL..."
164,1870,"Jul 7 2004	An enjoyable experience	First off, I loved the hotel and found my stay to be a truly pleasant experience. Yes the rooms are a bit small and the prices are exorbitant. But it's New York. If you want cheap, go to Cleveland. But I must say to &quot;Extremely Disappointed&quot;--it's not really fair of you to give such a negative review based on a 5-minute encounter with one doorman at a hotel at which you didn't even stay. Next time offer a tip to the doorman when you ask for a taxi. It's customary and expected--especially if you're not a paying guest of the hotel."
165,1870,"Jul 5 2004	Extremely Dissappointed	Although a beautiful hotel, I can not give the Mandarin Oriental Hotel a favorable review. After watching the fireworks show, and walking around the city, my sister and I accompanied, a few friends back to the hotel. We were staying at the Swissotel and after hearing them boast about how beautiful their hotel was, we decided to go see it for ourselves.  When we arrived there was no doorman to greet us at the door, he was actually at the front desk chatting with the front desk clerk. When we passed them they stared at us blankly, and then asked us if they could help us. The whole exchange was quite cold, not at all what I expected from a 5-star hotel.  The tip of the iceberg was when we were on our way out. We left through the mall exit, after searching for an ATM machine, and returned to the front desk so that my sister and I could get a cab to return home. It was 4:30 in the morning and pouring rain outside, yet once again we had to open the doors ourselves. Now Im not sure if it was the fact that we were young or Black, or a combination of the two but the same doorman and front desk clerk we had not passed but a half hour before, asked us if we were guests at the hotel. My friend replied that yes we were indeed guests. Incredulous, I asked the front guest clerk why the doorman asked this question when then they both saw us come in. To this she replied, Well, we saw you go in, but did not see you go out.  Stunned we went outside to wait for the doorman to hail us a taxi. While waiting, we observed the doorman who had previously neglected to open the front door for us, open it for a different group of guests at the hotel. The final insult came when after trying to hail a taxi for my sister and I for about 5 minutes, the doorman pointed us towards the umbrellas and told us we were better off standing on the corner and hailing the taxi from there. My brief visit to the hotel was terrible, and I would not under any circumstances visit there again."
166,1870,"Apr 5 2004	mixed feeling about this hotel	My husband and I love this hotel chain in general. We've actually stayed at the San Francisco one and the Miami one in the last six months. The new york one is gorgeous, but the drawbacks to this hotel is likely related to the fact that it is in new york. The rooms in SF and Miami were spacious and gorgeous.. The room we had in NY was small but still well decorated. The location of our room (near some service area where room service carts kept entering and the door kept slamming) was lousy. We were also at the end of a hallway where there were literally 4 other hotel room doors outside our door and no noise insulation, and our neighbors felt very comfortable slamming those doors around. For 600+ a night, this is not quite what I had in mind. Yes, NYC is crowded and real estate is at a premium, but I had expected more from the Mandarin Oriental. We still love this hotel chain, but the new york city one didn't achieve the level of comfort that the other ones did."
167,1870,"Apr 4 2004	2nd time around --Well done.	I visited MO New York in early December, when their doors were first opened, and was disappointed. I don't think they should have opened so soon, not only was the building still in pieces (chipped paint on doors, walls, ceilings; TV not functioning, internet down, room service 1.5 hours, pool closed) and the level of service was not their. The staff's service lacked efficiency, it seemed no matter what I asked for, and it took 30 min.I was back in New York last week, and stayed at the Ritz Central Park, my first. It was a disappointing experience from the start, but to their credit their management staff was courteous enough to find me another hotel, offering the MO New York. I agreed to move, thinking I would give them another shot --and Ritz was picking up the charges for my 2 night stay.I was welcomed back warmly, funny how they somehow remembered me. The arrival was smoother than I had remembered, and the on duty manager was gracious enough to extend a suite upgrade, even with a sold-out hotel. The tea did not take 45 min this time, the pool was open-what a view! I made a point to inspect whether the staff had gone back to touch up the paint chips on the doors and walls, which they did! The WiFi was up and running, so convenient and calming to sit early morning in the sky lounge overlooking Central Park, perhaps the best view in New York.Reading some of the previous comments, I sympathize with my fellow 'guinea pigs' for trying out this property, however my second experience reminded me that one bad encounter is not always the end-all. My hats off to the extremely courteous bell staff, front desk staff, and the level of professionalism put forth by all. Understandably any new property is going to have its own growing pains. Improvement is essential, and I felt sharing my story illustrates this. The newest and the best in New York, the second time around Has anyone been to their new property in DC?"
168,1870,"Apr 2 2004	Wonderful weekend experience	Wonderful stay over weekend at the Mandarin Oriental. We were celebrating a birthday, which was acknowledged at check in. Plus our room was upgraded with a wonderful Park View. Though the Trump Hotel was directly infront of us, we still had a great view all the way uptown. The service was wonderful and the staff brought up a special birthday dessert which was a nice surprise. The room was absolutely beautiful and luxurious. We were expecting the service to be a little &quot;off&quot; but were pleasantly surprised, by the attentiveness of the staff. They were very efficient and quick to take care of any requests. When we came back to the hotel in the evening there was a line outside the hotel for the popular MO Bar, but as long as you are staying in the hotel and show your room key you are able to go directly upstairs. The only downfall was the parking costs - $55 for one night! Understandably this is NYC, but the hotel should have some type of reduced rate. All in all, it exceeded our expectations!"
169,1870,"Mar 30 2004	Sadly this was one place I was more than happy to check out off	I had high hopes for our visit to Mandarin Oriental New York and had emailed the Manager in advance to way lay any concern I had from reading messages on here. As this was my partners first time in New York I wanted to make sure we had no unnecessary issues or problems. We had several communications between staff and were assured that we would have a memorable stay. I had booked the stay through Centurion Travel Services for 2 nights for 1 in a Premiere Hudson View room with Lunch for 2. In my mail I requested a quiet room on a high floor away from elevators and service entrances, basically a room that would be quiet.We were collected from JFK by a stretch limousine (surprise for my partner) from our long haul flight and arrived at the hotel around 6pm on Friday. Our arrival rather worryingly there was no doorman or bell boy. My partner and myself were left to drag our bags in to the unmanned reception area, we then made our way to the lift which turned our to be the entrance for the residential apartments!We eventually made it to the reception and were checked in by a very warm and courteous staff member who proceeded to take us to our Premiere Hudson View room on the 51st floor. The hotel was jam packed so they had been unable to upgrade us as had been mentioned in our previous correspondence, but this was not really a big deal.The room was delightful, small, but very well furnished with a wonderful bathroom and views of NY/Hudson River. As we settled in we were surprised to hear a lot of banging, on investigation it appeared that our room was located directly opposite a service entrance. Unfortunately the doors had little if any sound proofing making the noise rather unbearable. As we had previous correspondence with the manager and staff I had assumed there was some mistake and returned to the check in desk. On return it appeared that they had no other rooms available, and I asked to talk with the Duty Manager. After a short while I was then shown a room next door, but as you can expect this still had issues with noise. I returned to the reservation desk to be met by a rather abrupt and cold duty manager, I referred to my correspondence previously with the General Manger, but his had little if any impact. The Duty Manager then went on to inform me that due to the configuration of the hotel a large number of the rooms suffer from noise.Nearly an hour later, frustrated, tired and late for a meeting, the Duty Manager informed us they found a room but that we had to wait for housekeeping to freshen it up. As we were already late we told reception that as long as the room was quiet to go ahead and move our bags. On our return we found that our hotel had become he number one spot in New York and that we had to queue to gain entry I explained our situation but was told to wait in line!Eventually when we regained entry we found ourselves moved down to a room on the 43rd floor with a wonderful view of the Trump Hotel (Supposedly Park View)! The room was again comfortable and nicely decorated although not as pleasant as the original and with a smaller bathroom even though the room was classified an upgrade. There was no note in the room or message from the manager which would have helped in a small way to placate the situation. Instead every detail about this hotel that now went wrong had became a very big nagging one.Unable to sleep partly due to jet lag and also the annoyance of the situation I went down to the lobby to write an email to the manager conveying my concerns. I arrived in the lobby at 6am and found that there was no one around, and I mean no one, so I went behind the reception desk and called the operator to order some tea. Eventually staff arrived 20 minutes later as did my tea. In the meantime I put together an email for the manager and logged on to the hotels WIFI network to send it. Yet again I was faced by another problem the hotels WIFI setup was not functioning so I asked to speak to the next Duty Manager and presented the email on my laptop. He was exceptionally courteous and understanding of the issues and assured me that he will do all that he can to put us into a nice room. I reasserted that we did not want an upgrade just a room as originally agreed &quot;on a high floor away from elevators and service entrances&quot;.We were out for the rest of the day and returned to the hotel at around 6pm on Saturday. At reception we picked up our keys for our new room located on the 42nd floor 9 floors down from the original, although I believe we were meant to be impressed by the fact we had been awarded a suite. The suite was cold and unwelcoming with no carpets just black floor and occasional rugs, compared to the other rooms this one felt inferior in finish infact as though it had not been finished. Again no note or message from the manager. It also appeared to be located right on Columbus Circle meaning that the noise levels were higher than any of the previous rooms! Understandably we were at the end of our tethers and realised that this hotel was never going to be able to deliver on service or promise, something we found very disappointing for a member of the Mandarin group. As previously arranged I spoke to the Front Of House Manager informing him of my dismay at the hotel and its handling of our situation. What is the point of extensive communication with the hotel's General Manager when the requests are ignored. In all fairness he did wish to resolve the problems, but as we were departing the next day we felt there was really nothing they could do to restore our faith in this hotel.On Sunday we were joined by a friend for lunch in the hotels restaurant which was very enjoyable, infact the breakfast and Lunch were about the only 2 times this hotel really lived up to the Mandarin vision. As it was late and the restaurant was due to close we decided to take our tea and coffee in the lobby, but on transfer were told by another member of staff we would have to wait an hour for a table as the hotel lobby is very popular!Then came check out with the Duty Manager from our first night, the bill came out and contained a few errors. Firstly it contained charges for lunch which was complimentary and secondly it contained a charge for 2 nights when we were on the Centurion offer, 1 night free. Starting to feel like a pariah I noted these mistakes to the rather disgruntled Manager who went onto inform me that as my reservation had been made by Platinum Travel the offer of the free night was not valid. Thankfully I had a confirmation from Centurion Travel in my suitcase and found this rather needless situation a prime example of the hotels negative attitude. To placket the manager I travelled down 35 floors to our stored baggage and collected my paper work, queued up for the lift and returned to the reception. After some more discussion she begrudgingly removed the 2nd nights charge, however had she referred to my correspondence with the manager this embarrassing situation would have been avoidable.My partner and myself had a wonderful weekend in New York and a memorable stay at the Mandarin Oriental, but for all the wrong reasons. This hotel fails to live up to the values of this superb group and failed to tackle problems when it had the opportunity. Indeed the hotel has many wonderful aspects and is a visual delight, but I'm sorry to say that it is a victim of its own success. Queuing up to get into you hotel, queuing up to sit in your on lobby and being given assurances that are not met does not a 5 star hotel make , far less a Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Sadly this was one place I was more than happy to check out off and will not be returning to soon."
170,1870,Mar 8 2004	Nice but no Four Seaons	I agree with the previous post. This is a beautiful hotel and the views are spectacular. But at this price I would prefer to stay at the Four Seasons. The MO has much smaller rooms and to me is a little too hip. Plus the service is not nearly as good as the Four Seasons. The bar was cool but we had to wait 30 minutes to get in even as a guest of the hotel. I'm gald that we stayed and were able to enjoy a breathtaking view of the city for a night but won't stay there again.
171,1870,"Mar 2 2004	great experience but Four Seasons still best in NYC	We just got back from the MO NYC. We'd actually planned to stay there last November but it wasn't quite open (there was some slippage as is normal with new buildings of this scale). To their credit, MO gave us the &quot;soft opening&quot; rates when we went back last week, and upgraded us to a Premier Central Park View room on the 51st floor as we were celebrating my birthday and our anniversary.The view, obviously, is incredible. Although Trump's building is right in front the position of the new tower is such that you still get great views around it. However, the room is pretty tight for space - if you're from the UK you may have stayed in a 'Travelodge' and the room is just like a more upscale version of that kind of room. The high-tech tv/computer set up is a little too tricksy - like other reviewers, we did have to call tech support (in our case just to be able to change the volume on the TV!) but to be fair they were fast on the scene and quick to fix the problem, which remained fixed.There were a few little glitches with the service, overall it's just not as slick as the Four Seasons - possibly it just needs some bedding-in time, although both my wife and I noticed the quality of fit-and-finish is nowhere near the FS standard.For such an expensive and high-profile (and spectacular) building it really seemed like they'd &quot;spoiled the ship for a ha'peth of tar&quot; so to speak.We found the Asiate restaurant a bit like the hotel - i.e. very flash and spectacular but a bit too tricksy. Sometimes fusion food sounds unlikely but really works when you taste it (the shrimp with pasta cooked in paper with XO sauce is superb), but mostly it tasted as odd as it sounds. To be fair, though, we had eaten the previous evening at the consistently excellent Four Seasons restaurant (not affiliated with the hotel) and the night before at Daniel Boulud's DB, and both were really exceptional, so Asiate had a high bar to reach.It will always be full, because of the beautiful room and stunning view, and it's definitely worth a look.The intimate &quot;MO bar&quot; across the lobby is fabulous, but permanently very busy with both New Yorkers and tourists from other hotels, as is the lobby bar. I guess it's the view again - quite a rarity still in NY.One nice touch is the private access to the shopping centre from the hotel's elevator - makes you feel privileged somehow! The shopping is nothing special but there's a good Dean &amp; Deluca in the Borders store and some great restaurants which should all be open by the time you go!Overall, then, fantastic experience (and great view) but next time, if I were paying the full rate, I'd still choose the Four Seasons - for the same money you'd get a (less spectacular) view and a much bigger room, plus it's quieter, better quality and smoother service. But I am grateful to have experienced the MO."

1,1881,"Great Hotel and Great Locations	This hotel and location are great. I have stayed at many hotels in the City and I must say this one is one of the best. The location is great even being in the middle of Time Square which I normally do not like but views were awesome. Restaurants and bars on 8th floor were very convenient and for us to eat or just relax and enjoy the lights. Rooms were good size, clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!"
2,1881,"Beautiful	The best hotel I've stayed at. Astonishing views, magnificent decor... truly amazing!"
3,1881,"Wonderful hotel wondeful location	I stayed with my husband and two teenage children at this hotel for two nights. The room was clean, the service was excellent, and the location could not be better. We really enjoyed being in the heart of Time Square."
4,1881,"Nov 26 2009 	marriott marquis- microcosm of new york	All-in-all, our stay at the Marriott Marquis was quite enjoyable. The location is ideal. Located right in the heart of Times Square and the theater district, the hotel is also a relatively easy walk to central park, rockefeller center, 5th ave. shopping, and Macy's. The hotel itself can be a bit overwhelming, as a previous reviewer pointed out. It is crowded and noisy. I was woken up several times during the night by such things as a blood-curdling scream, a drunken hallway reveler, and emergency equipment outside. Of course, you do sign on for a bit of this with any trip to NYC, so it is hard to fault the hotel. If you are not a Marriott rewards member, be prepared for long waits for check-in and check-out. If you are a member, be prepared for dirty looks from those who are not. Then again, it is exactly all of this that makes the hotel special. It is exciting and vibrant, immense and bold. It is full of life. It is exactly what you go to New York for. Parking and drop-off are quite convenient. Don't go by your GPS, we circled around the block for a good while. CALL for directions from the Lincoln Tunnel. Once you arrive, there is a spacious area to unload, and they take your car right from you. Parking was $65 a day with a hotel rate. The room itself was certainly nice, although not spectacular. Unfortunately, it really was not cleaned for what you would expect from a hotel of this price and caliber. There was some hair on the bathroom floor, coffee stains in the sink, and someones groceries in one of the bureau drawers. I guess this could happen anywhere. Aside from that, the room was comfortable, and provided a great sense of privacy amidst the craziness of our surroundings.We had a very good (although not great) meal at the View restaurant. I must admit that it seems to have lost a bit in quality over the years. We ate there several times in the 90s, and it was sensational. What used to be an amazing array of deserts was now a choice between ice cream and cheese cake. The price fixe menu was convenient, and the food certainly was delicious. As always, the view is amazing. It actually was particularly welcoming of my kids (5,6). The waitress, Tracy, learned their names, and was VERY attentive to them all night long. It really says something about a restaurant to balance elegance with kid-friendly. One side note- the area around this hotel is unbelievably expensive. If you want a cheap, uncrowded, kid-friendly break, hit the McDonald's across the street from the hotel. Sure it is McDonald's, but it is priced consistently with their status quo. There is plenty of seating, and clean bathrooms. We ate breakfast there for $26 for 5 people. The next morning we ate at Sarah Beth's on central park for $140. All-in-all, I certainly recommend this hotel."
5,1881,"Nov 23 2009 	Generally great with a few odd experiences	Just spent 5 nights at this Marriott Marquis for a conference. Overall, the experience was very positive. Rooms were decent sizes, clean etc. Lobby was great. Elevators worked well even with a large crowd of people, though I wouldn't want to see what would happen if the computer system glitched. Concierge lounge was great with decent breakfast, free wifi, never ending supply of san pellegrino etc. Staff very pleasant. Good fitness center with no extra charges like Hilton often does and decent business center. Only three complaints. First, one of the bars (which was set up for a poster session) nearly turned us away at 5:50 pm saying they wouldn't open until 6pm. Second, the next day the main restaurant was closed for lunch at 11:45 am and when it was set to open was only opening for a buffet, no menu options as they had the day before. Third, the concierge lounge regularly closes on friday afternoons for the whole weekend. All of this seemed rather bizzarre for a hotel that had accepted a 4000 plus person business conference."
6,1881,"Nov 19 2009 	Great hotel for first time trip to New York	We arrived at the hotel at 4:00 PM, which is normally a primetime check-in time. We were checked in immediately, with no wait. We had a delightful young woman who fell all over herself trying to introduce us to New York City, and giving us pointers. She whispered, and told us she was giving us a complimentary upgrade that would normally be $50 more per night. We had confirmed a standard King room, and were upgraded to a Corner King Room with view of Times Square. We found the elevators simple and efficient, never waiting more than 60 seconds. We were delighted with the room. Large hotel room, with a well appointed bathroom. The floor to ceiling window view of Times Square was fantastic, but the star of the room was the bed. That bed was phenomenal. We didnt use facilities like the gym or any bars, but we did do the buffet at the VIew Lounge in the rotating restaraunt. It was very pricey and only ok. It wasnt bad. It was just ok. The service was horrible. This hotel was so well located to all 4 broadway shows we saw and if you stay here, you must try Junior's across the street. Such great food!!!!"
7,1881,"Nov 18 2009 	Great Hotel	This was a awesome hotel, everything was beatiful and was in the center of Time Square. Definently worth the money!"
8,1881,"Nov 17 2009 	Almost overwhelming	1 night stay at Marriott Marquis - was actually trying it to decide if I wanted to bring family here next summer. I am still on the fence. I am a rewards member and find Marriotts to be consistent and one of my preferred brrands. The Marquis is just average. Frankly - for a family its got everything you need - but its just too big. The elevators have to be keyed into your floor and then they tell you which elevator to wait for - I was on the 34th floor in a large corner king suite - great view and great space - but this hotel is like a mini city itself - that dumps out into the extremely busy Times Square - I like my travel to be a little more low key and intimate. The staff were quite friendly and accomodating - but it is a little unnerving that the trunks of all cars and cabs are inspected as you pull up - of course you are reminded of the terror strikes at Marriotts at other parts of the world and are comforted knowing Marriott takes safety seriously, but it really emphasizes the size of this facility. I ate at the View restaraunt at the top, that rotates around for a full view of the city - not only was the environment lovely, the meal was better than I expected for a fixed priced 3 course menu. I liked the many amenities here, including an incredible fitness center, bars restaurants, Starbucks, you name it . . but if you are looking for more personal experience, quiet and ease of travel - look at a smaller hotel off of Times Square."
9,1881,"Nov 16 2009 	Always reliable and close to everything	This was the 5th time I have stayed at this hotel and it didn't disappoint. Always clean, safe and in the middle of all the Broadway shows. Also very convenient to Newark airport. The Lincoln tunnel exit is just a few short blocks from the hotel. You can't beat the location if you're in town to see Broadway shows. Good, fast room service and very nice, clean rooms. Excellent, friendly staff. Really great fitness center, too, that is open 24 hours a day. Upper floor rooms are amazingly quiet, too. Very good insulation between rooms and floors. Only problem can be getting a cab to another part of town. Cabbies don't like to get stuck in all the Broadway traffic."
10,1881,"Nov 11 2009 	Great Location	We stayed on the 27th floor facing the Viacom building. The view out our window was of other buildings but was beautiful at night when all the lights were on. We booked our room on Priceline and paid $225 per night. Our king size bed was so comfortable and had lots of pillows. Our room was spacious, quiet and clean. This location is central to so many things within walking distance. I was glad to have a bath tub to soak in after long walks each day. There is a Starbucks on the 8th floor that sells great oatmeal for breakfast. &quot;The View&quot; is a rotating lounge on the 48th floor that has outstanding views of the city! They have a dinner buffet for $32 pp and a cheese/dessert buffet for $17pp. I would definitely stay here again!"
11,1881,"Nov 8 2009 	Large rooms good service excellent location	This may be my favorite hotel in New York. If you want to be in the middle of it all, the Marriott Marquis is a great choice. The rooms are larger than the average NY hotel room. If you're lucky, you can get a Times Square view (and the heavy curtains will block out the light so you can sleep.) The front desk staff is pleasant at check-in, and they really seem to &quot;get it,&quot; that they need to treat people with respect. The same goes for the bell staff -- hard working people who seem to care. My only complaint: The View Lounge, and its cover charge. I think guests of the hotel should have the cover waived. I don't mind the one-drink minimum, but as a guest, I think I should get priority over people wandering in."
12,1881,"Nov 5 2009 	Great Experience	**This review first went to another Marriott hotel(marriott courtyard on time square) by mistake. Since another viewer brought the mistake to my attention, I wanted to make sure I reviewed the correct hotel since we had such a wonderful experience. Went to NYC for New Years Eve, so obviously this hotel was a great location. The staff was terriffic and always helpful, especially Steven Reyes (parking) and Jonathan ?(Asian gentleman at front desk). The hotel is beautiful inside and convenient to many places. Go up and have dinner or dessert at the rotating restaurant on the top floor. Very nice view. Great breakfast buffet in the lobby restaurant plus Starbucks is right inside hotel, too. Not too sure about normal rates, but our rate was outrageous due to it being New Years Eve on Time Square. Our room faced the ball drop! Besides price, I would definitely recommend to anyone. Also, walk over to Juniors for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Wonderful diner food and great cheesecake. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone who is not on a tight budget!"
13,1881,"Nov 4 2009 	New York New York!	This hotel is in the heart of it all, Times Square. The hotel is a very large, modern hotel with all the bells and whistles of a Marriott...lounges, restaurants, shops, etc. We requested a Times Square View Room, which was great. You could watch below and see the hustle and bustle of the city, yet the room was so quiet you could here a pin drop. The beds are so comfy! The bathroom was clean, updated and adequate also. If you are a theatre person, this hotel is a must. Excellent location to walk just about anywhere. We walked to the Today Show, which is at Rockefeller Plaza. We also walked down Fifth Ave. More restaurants around you than you can eat at in one weekend. Subway station is a couple blocks away too. The lounges and bars all have great views of the city and Times Square. Relax and have a cocktail and watch the world! Loved it Loved it Loved it!"
14,1881,"Nov 4 2009 	If you want to be in the centre of New York........	This hotel is in Time Square. You couldn't be nearer. Just a few blocks from all the other attractions as well, so makes the ideal stay. The rooms are good, though not as modern as you would think. Great coffee making facilities and the views from windows are great. The resaurants are very expensive but you have to eat in the View as it rotates very slowly while you eat good food and the views are brilliant.Good gym that also overlooks Time Square and is freeOnly down side is the size of the hotel makes it a little inpersonal, but hey you can put up with that for the great location"
15,1881,"Nov 3 2009 	Great Location	I was very happy with the location of this hotel. It was like I never saw anyone who worked there though. The room was always clean when we returned and staff were doing what they needed to do without being in your face. I can't say enough about the location and the fun we had on this weekend. I do think the food at the hotel was way over the top in price. Three of us couldn't eat for less than $100. This is crazy even for New York. That's why I feel there was no value there. I paid $470 per night with tax and then got ripped off on food. JUST DON&quot;T EAT THERE!!! I guess all you can say about this place is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION."
16,1881,"Nov 3 2009 	Great location large busy hotel	The Marriott delivers in the this busy part of nyc. Centrally located with helpful staff, will return again."
17,1881,"Nov 1 2009 	Why do they dislike customers so much?	Way too big and impersonal. Had a great week in NY where pretty much everybody we dealt with was friendly, EXCEPT the staff at the Marriott Marquis. Half of the people we talked to in that hotel clearly resented being there and having to deal with customers.We also felt less safe in the hotel than out on the street: multiple entries, nobody checks who gets in the door. It looks as if anybody could roam the halways and barge into your room, just like in a cheap motel. Scary."
18,1881,"Oct 31 2009 	Can't beat the location but you can probably beat the service..	This stay was not the first time I've stayed at this hotel, but it's my first since joining as a reviewer of this site.The Marriott Marquis has many things going for it - some good, some bad. First of all, if you are a theater-goer, you cannot beat the location of this hotel. The Marquis is within 4 blocks of most theaters, not to mention the literal location of one (The Marquis Theater). To be so close to all the shows is incredibly handy, however even if you don't go to a performance, you are still at the doorstep of everything. TKTS, shopping and restaurants surround this property.On the inside, this hotel is immense. Right away you will encounter my biggest pet peeve with this property - the elevators. Once heralded as 'New York's Smartest Elevators!', the system to work them is not only a pain but also incredibly annoying. Operating them involves putting your desired floor on a keypad and having it tell you which elevator to go to. If you understand the system, it works ok. The problem is, many people don't so they enter your elevator, cannot find the keypad and then are stumped with what to do. Furthermore, some put their number on the pad, miss the elevator location, and then re-enter it. By doing so, their floor is called on two different elevators so there is the potential for you to be on an elevator by yourself with 6 stops. I find them incredibly unreliable and wish they would go back to regular keypads in the elevators.Aside from that, the hotel rooms are large, some of the largest I've ever stayed in in New York. The beds are incredibly comfortable and lots of rooms provide wonderful views of Times Square. Bathrooms are also quite big and the Bath &amp; Body Works products are a nice touch.One place this hotel is lacking is the service. Marriott is typically dependable for good service however this property generally lacks it. I've encountered pompous and rude front desk staff in previous stays who act like it is the best hotel in the city. Also, pressing 'At Your Service' on your phone, the only button in which to contact anybody, often results in waits of around 15 rings, and many times, no answer at all.The fitness center is large and overlooks Times Square - a huge plus. Also open 24 hours a day, at with most hotels these days. I haven't ever eaten at the restaurants in the hotel - there are far better ones outside the front door. Two Starbucks inside are convinient, though the one in the lobby has minimal hours. You are better off going to the one on the 1st floor.In terms of connectivity, you can purchase Marriott's 'Wired For Business' program for $15.95 a night, which includes high speed internet and free calls to anywhere in the US. I suppose some people may find this handy, although as someone who would just like the internet, the cost is a bit steep.I think this hotel really is an equal combination of good and bad. It has a lot of positive points - its location and rooms, and some things to be wary of - its staff and the elevators. I would stay here again, no problem - but it would probably not be my first choice."
19,1881,"Oct 30 2009 	Awesome location	Attended a conference and the location is awesome. It is on Times Square, and minutes from Penn Station. The bar area is a great place to meet with people, one on one. There are many levels of meeting rooms so sharing the site with other conferences works well. The Theatre district is all around the hotel, so walking to a show is EASY. The elevators are different, as you will find that you need to go to a kiosk and type in your floor # you want to go to, and then it tells you the elevator to go to (they have over 15 to choose) and it just goes up to your floor. Most are external with glass views of the interior as you travel up or down the elevator"
20,1881,"Oct 25 2009 	Great Value for NYC - very spacious rooms	I have stayed at the Waldorf, the Palace and the Ritz Carlton Battery Park. For the money I do recommend the Marriott Marquis. The rooms are larger that most other hotels most with views of Times Square, and they are well appointed with very nice bedding, furnishings and large flat screen TVs. If you are looking for an elegant lobby or atrium, this is not the place, it's quite institutional in appearance and a bit of a convention hotel. However, the rooms are much better than most, in fact, far better than the rooms I stayed in at the Waldorf Astoria on the two occasions I stayed at the Waldorf at a fraction of the price. The food from both room service and some of the restaurants is however mediocre at best."
21,1881,"Oct 25 2009 	Marriott Marquis Running a Check Cashing Scam	In April 2009 I stayed at the Marriott Marquis in NYC. During my stay I cashed a check for 100 USD. The hotel cashed the check in April. Then in June they cashed the check a second time. When I called to inquire I was given the run around. (I call A, A tells me to call B, B tells me to call C, C tells me to call A.) When I finally did get through to someone they told me this had happened to other guests, but that they would fix it. Two weeks later I received a threat laced demand letter from a collection agency hired by Marriott. They demanded that I PAY another 100 USD, plus penalties, plus interest. I sent proof to the credit rating agency that it was Marriott that owed me the money. They did not care. They kept coming after me and threatened to destroy me credit rating based on Marriott's lies. So I traced the trail of legal entities associated with this credit rating agency and threatened them with legal action if they did not back off. They stood down. Marriott still had not refunded my money. So I continued to pursue a refund from Marriott. They were unapologetic for stealing my money, unapologetic for refering me to the collection agents, and unwilling to refund the money dispite the undisputed fact that they had cashed my check twice. Just as I was about to file pleadings to initiate a lawsuit to recover the money Marriott came to a settlement with me. They refunded my money and payed me for SOME of the damages they had inflicted.Although Marriott did end up refunding the money, pursuing the matter entailed a great deal of personal time and risk. Im my opinion the management of the Marriott Marquis in NYC is incompetent and untrustworthy."
22,1881,"Oct 22 2009 	Great location extortionate prices!	Stayed here for five nights and was hit with $200 per night rate increase after second night because of UN Assembly in town. Had to pay $18US for a cup of tea delivered to room but could have had coffee for free! Had to pay for wireless internet. Had business meeting in lobby and had to collect Starbucks from foyer because coffee shop wouldn't provide coffee to table right outside their entrance! Looks polished, has all the facilities but no heart and not much service and not good value."
23,1881,"Oct 21 2009 	Great location	I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel. The location was central to subway locations, Broadway Theaters and restaurants. The WiFi was ultra expensive at nearly $20 a day with multiple taxes tagged on to the price of $16.95. The rooms were decent, nothing to fancy, and there were two Starbucks on the property. The elevator system can be a little confusing. Had many people get on not knowing you have to push the floor number on one of the keypads before entering the assigned elevator. The hotel bar is a total wast of $9 to just get in. Save your money. The view isn't spectacular. The hotel was also close to Hell's Kitchen which is full of local favorite dining spots so if you want to avoid the chains, this area is a close walk to 9th Ave."
24,1881,"Oct 21 2009 	Great Location!	We stayed at the Marriott Marquis on Sept. 8 and 9 and were very pleased with the location. It was within walking distance of everything we planned to see and do. When we got out of the car at the main entrance, the bell hop asked if we would like him to take our bags up to our room. He said they would be delivered to our room within 10 minutes after we checked in. It took us about 2 minutes to check in at the elite check-in desk (we are Marriott Platimum Members) and we were upgraded to a room with a view of Times Square. There were plenty of elevators, and as we walked down the hall to our room, we realized that the bell hop and our luggage was about 20 feet in back of us. Wow---what service! The room was larger than we expected and had a comfy bed with 6 pillows, desk/table, 2 chairs, ottoman, and loveseat. We ate at one of the smaller restaurants in the hotel and the food was average and a bit pricey. There are plenty of places to eat within walking distance of the hotel. We had access to the Concierge Lounge and ate breakfast there two days. The food selection was adequate and the Lounge was never crowded. Housekeeping was great---we left in the morning and the room was always cleaned by the time we came back in the afternoon. We were on the 29th floor and found it to be very quiet--- no street noises or noise from the adjacent rooms. We have no complaints about this hotel and would stay there again when we return to New York City."
25,1881,"Oct 20 2009 	Excellent Location spacious rooms!	We were very happy with our room at the Marriott Marquis. Our room was spacious, clean and very quiet. We remarked how we could not hear any noise from the hallways or the streets. The staff was very friendly and we were especially happy to have two Starbucks in the the hotel!"
26,1881,Oct 19 2009 	Marriott Marquis in New York	This was our first time at the Marriott Marquis near Times Square in New York. Our room overlooked Broadway but was very quiet inside. The room was very clean with lots of room and amenities. The bed was very comfortable. We had one incident where we contacted management and this was handled very quickly and to our satisfaction. Our hotel was within easy walking distance of several Broadway plays and fairly close to the subway transit system. We will definitely stay here when we return to New York.
27,1881,"Oct 19 2009 	Couldn't have asked for a better hotel 	12 of us were staying at the Marriott Marquis as part of a wedding group. The hotel staff were fantastic, really couldn't have been nicer. The rooms were superb - very clean and welcoming. The room service staff were also very friendly and more than happy to fit in cleaning the rooms around our schedule. The location was ideal - right in Times Square it was ideal. There were always plenty of taxis available within the hotel, and the porters were very helpful. The limo service also came in very useful as there were so many of us. I would definitely stay here again, without question."
28,1881,"Oct 18 2009 	The Best Choice for a Times Square stay!	This Hotel has everything anyone could possibly need for a weekend or a month stay! The location is outstanding- right smack in the middle of Times Square and walking distance to most all of the theatres. Never a dull moment, there is always something to do. Hotel staff were very professional, courteous, &amp; helpful, while at the same time they knew when to keep their distance and not smother us with too much info or help. The rooms are luxurious and the beds were fabulous, a great and comfortable place to unwind after a busy day in the city. I will stay here again on my next trip and have already referred others to do the same."
29,1881,"Oct 17 2009 	Bad service and no empathy	We have stayed in the MM at Times Square in the past, and it was okay. It is hard to get a cab in and out some times due to congestion. This year we had terrible service, The wrong room when we arrived late, a move to a very noisy room, and a third move to a decent room, no paper, not much empathy or assistance with these issues, then to top it off, double billing to the company and my credit card for several days of the stay. Can they fix this, not on the first call, I will have to call back to see. I will not be back. This is expensive and not worthy of the investment."
30,1881,"Oct 17 2009 	Awful!!!	This by far has the worst customer service, for the price we paid... I expected a much nicer front desk. Were not accomodating at all! Willnever stay here again...I'll stay at the Hilton."
31,1881,"Oct 16 2009	Great Honeymoon Memorry!	We went to NYC last summer for our honeymoon trip. We stayed at the Marriott hotel by Time Square so that we can wall around and get to the train station easily. I loved &quot;The View&quot; restaurant up above the hotel, I don't remember to floor number but that is the restaurant you have to go when you come to NYC. It spinning around starting at 7:00p.m to 10p.m. Drinks are fantastic a long with their great, special buffet bars."
32,1881,"Oct 14 2009 	Great location	Great location if you want to be in Times Square and the Theater District. Rooms were roomy and comfortable. The hotel is huge, but the concierge was very helpful. There is also an onsite Starbucks and an American Express travel office which are both helpful. Price wasn't great, but what I expected."
33,1881,"Oct 14 2009 	worst customer service experince ever	This hotel has a great location. But this is where it stops. We were here for five nights and were told we would recived a time square view room which was booked four months ago. At check in the desk was rude even by New York standards. It was obvious they had given our room away as we arrived late and their was a lot of discussion among the staff as to what they were to do with us. To bad you were misinformed nothing we can do about it was the reply from the shift leader. Check tomorrow was the reply we got through out our stay. A large monolith of a hotel. With a cavernous atrium which has the bed room corridors opening on to it surrounded by 45 floors of grilled corridors giving it a prison like feel. Felt more like an inmate then a guest. We were on the concierge floor. At check in we were rudely told if we wanted an upgrade it would cost $65 although this was not what we were told when the reservation was made. But we could not get the upgrade because &quot;we are full and you can check on line and see if you can get a room&quot;. Check back tomorrow we can move you. The following morning at the elite member desk this guy was even ruder, if that was possible, then the night before and had dismissive reaction. Well we are full tonight. Although last night they had rooms for the next night again got well check on line we dont have anything. Check tomorrow. I mentioned I would like to unpack and not live out of my suite case the reply was &quot;so&quot;. Asked to speak to manager three times on three separate occasions no one contacted us during the entire stay. The sound proofing was terrible could here the guests next door every time they used their bathroom. Asked for newspaper delivery, it supposed to be comp never got one during the entire stay. Our room had no bathrobes for the entire stay although the other rooms did. Recived turn down service on two of the five days. We decided to take advantage of the breakfast set out for elite Marriott members. At best it was mediocre. The eggs were dry and the bananas overripe. The toaster handles were broken. A lady in front of me who was trying to toast a mini bagel could not retrieve her bagel without using a fork to fish her bagel out of the toaster. After this we gave it a miss for two days and went out. On the third day we went back only to find a huge line of guest waiting at the buffet but no food. Comments from the other guests were they had been waiting for fifteen minutes we walked out. This is their concierge floor reserved for their frequent guest and those paying full rates. Hate to see what was happening on the lower floors. At check out we were greeted by the desk staff or I should say not greeted. She asked how our stay was just as my partner said &quot;well it was&quot; this is as far as he got before she came back with your balance is.... She had no interest in knowing how are stay was. We were stunned that she just cut him off and said have a nice day. That was it. The bell desk was just as unfriendly as we went to store our bags a great push was made for a tip. In all my travels around the world and this may have been my 30+ trip to New York in ten years and having stayed at various properties such as the Plaza, Sheraton, Hilton and Novotel. This was the worst front desk experience I have ever had anywhere. The only staff that we came into contact that were pleasant was the security and information desk at the entrance to the elevators from the street. Stayed at many Marriotts over the years the sprit of Marriott is definitely missing from this hotel. Looked for a comment card could not find one anywhere. Marriott made absolutely no attempt at service recovery. For the price of $400+ go to the W hotel which is right next door"
34,1881,Oct 11 2009 	It's in the details - loved the elevator system	The Marquis is in the heart of the theater district. I traveled alone so it was a perfect spot for me. I went to several Broadway shows. I could walk back with the crowds and never felt anxious because I was single woman. The room was very comfortable. The staff were always polite - especially the &quot;maid&quot; service. They greeted me with a smile and hello no matter what time of day or night I came and went from my room. The detail I loved was the elevator system. There's a panel where you select your floor and then you are assigned an elevator. Wonderful. No pushing or shoving or jockeying for position. It seems small but i loved it. I hate trying to play the &quot;which elevator is next game&quot; and having rude people cut me off.
35,1881,"Oct 9 2009 	Great location and comfortable beds but weak customer service and noisy neighbors	Our party included two moms and our 8 year old daughters for a girls' trip to NYC. Our room was definitely on the smaller side, but we had a great view of Times Square. As an aside, while making the reservation, I was told that I was eligible for a complimentary upgrade which was not the case when we checked in ($50 fee per night for view). We had also been told that Marriott would do something nice for our birthday girls which was not the case. Unfortunately, we ended up next to a very loud and lets say frisky party next door that woke us up several times during the night and between 5 and 6 every morning which meant that I could not fall back asleep. My daughter asked me on more then one occasion why our neighbors were &quot;screaming&quot; in the middle of the night. When I reported the issue to the front desk, the attendant had no interest in helping us resolve the problem by contacting our neighbors to request them to please be more quiet. Instead, we would have to call security on them throughout the night. We had a wonderful trip and loved the location, but I was less than enthused with the customer service aspect. The price for internet access (wired) was also exhorbitant in my opinion(nearly $20 a day after taxes). I hate feeling like I am being nickled and dimed when I am already paying a high nightly rate."
36,1881,"Oct 9 2009 	FABULOUS!	A seriously lovely hotel, came here as part of our honeymoon. We were upgraded to a room on one of the top floors and given a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates to celebrate our wedding. the room was huge, bed was the most amazing and comfortable bed that i have ever stayed in. Location - well you cant get a better location, right in the heart of time square. Even writing about this hotel excites me. The bars and restaurants were excellent. I cannot fault this hotel and would recommed anyone that anyone stay here! fabulous fabulous fabulous!"
37,1881,"Oct 8 2009	Manhattan NYC	We stayed at the Marriott Marquis NYC Times Square from August 5 - 12, 2009. It was a wonderful time. The hotel was wonderful, very clean &amp; comfortable. Being right in the heart of Times Square was awesome! Make time for Ground Zero &amp; a Broadway show. We saw Wicked &amp; it was so breathtaking. A trip well worth repeating."
38,1881,Oct 8 2009 	Big Apple	The Marriott was a great hotel in the greatest city. The value comes in its central location to Times Square/Midtown - theatre/restaurants/shopping. Everyone was very friendly and the hotel restaurant (The View) was amazing!Enjoyed our stay and would always recommend to other folks.
39,1881,Oct 8 2009 	Great Stay	We really enjoyed our stay at the Marquis. The rooms were great and beds were very comfortable. The location right now Times Square was amazing!
40,1881,"Oct 8 2009 	Perfect location!	I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Manhattan...it is perfectly located.I traveled with my mother (76) and my niece (21). We were there for four nights.My mother and I have stayed at the Marriott many times because we feel safe there.My niece had never been to NY, so it was a perfect location for sightseeing.It is also centrally located for shopping and evening shows / plays - we saw three. It can be pricey depending on what's going on in the city, but it's in line with the others.I always recommed this hotel when I'm asked."
41,1881,"Oct 6 2009 	Girls weekend in the City	The Marriott is always a safe bet, so I booked three weeks before our trip and there were still rooms available. On our way there we had problems finding out how to get there because mapquest doesnt take into account the piece of broadway you cant drive down, so use the hotel's directions once in the city. The room we were given - she said &quot;partial view&quot; and i was nervous but we were looking right down on times square from the side of the building and thats more than i ever expected. We got a standard double double for the four of us and it was very spacious, with an area for sitting. I requested a mini fridge and it was in my room almost before we made it up there, and they didnt charge me for it. Ive heard alot of complaints about the elevators but i thought the system very fast. Got room service one night, which was a little expensive for some burgers and stale grilled cheese but after two exhausting days of shopping, it was hassle free and filling. The parking cost us $55 per night plus tip to both valets pick up and drop off, which was expensive. I considered parking somewhere and driving in but im glad i didnt because after three days of sore feet i just wanted to leave. Check out day, they'll keep your bags for free, except baggage valet tip, and you have to return by 10:45 to pick them up. We finished our sightseeing and returned at time specified, turned in car slip and baggage slip... both came out about same time, but car valet guy says i am suppose to charge you another $55 because you went over your 24 hours but i am going to let it slide. More tip. Overall great experience and I would return again."
42,1881,Oct 4 2009 	Weekend Away	Hotel was great. Service at the front deck was great. We asked to check in at 10 a.m. and were allowed to do so. We asked for a high floor and we were given a great room with a Times Square view. We went up to the view lounge for cocktails and when spinning around passed the W hotel I have to say that people should know you can see in the windows. We saw some things we would rather not have seen lol. The service and location of this hotel were fantastic!!!!!!!!!
43,1881,"Oct 4 2009 	great location poor check-in	We booked 2 rooms at Marriott Marquis and stayed there for 2 nights. Being a Marriott associate myself, I expected the usual world famous Marriott friendly and helpful associates, however, my check-in experience was far from friendly. The front desk agent ignored me as I stood in front of her counter for several minutes while she goes about doing her business in the computer, and only after several minutes she looked up to assist me. She did not smile the whole time she was doing the check-in process, and was not the friendliest associate I've encountered during our stay.Our room was spacious with great view of Times Square (which we paid for), however the other room we booked which is located next to our room only had a tiny peek of Times Square (they shouldn't call it Times Square view and charged us more for it if we can only see a little bit of it from the farthest end of the window). Bed sheets was tattered, it's about time they replaced them. We can still hear constant noises from Times Square eventhough the hotel advertised that guests will be able to sleep soundly.Bellman who delivered our suitcase was corteous, however, the bellman who picked up our luggage for storage took his sweet time to write the storage note while waiting for us to give him tips.Concierge was very helpful throughout our stay, special thanks to all the doorman on the first floor for showing us directions, Janet who helped us with finding restaurants, and Nelson for saving us with our last minute van booking to the airport.We did have an incident at the airport. We noticed our driver (Caceres, Rodolfo) was swaying a little and he started driving really slow. When we reached JFK and after taking out our luggage, the driver dropped flat on the ground. We didnt know if he was drunk or he was having a heart attack. Then he got up to his feet and walked to the driver's side, that's when we saw him again flat on the ground. We called the airport security who immediately helped him. This is very dangerous and we want to let the hotel know of this incident and makes sure the driver is fine and find out what was wrong with him, we could've had an accident!"
44,1881,"Oct 2 2009 	Great location but often unfriendly service	We stayed at The Marriott Marquis for 4 nights. The best thing about this hotel is its location IF you are a tourist and in NYC to do touristy things. However do not choose this hotel if you are seeking peace and quiet as it's right by Times Square. There was a big convention ongoing while we stayed there and there were teenagers running across our hall at past midnight. Despite the 22 high-speed elevators, there was often a queue for them. The first few times you are on those high-speed elevators, you also feel like you're going to be sick, but you get used to it by the second day or so.The best things about the room are that it was spacious, and we had a great view of Times Square from the 22nd floor. There's also a nice widescreen TV and the beds and pillows were super comfortable. However, housekeeping is not attentive. They had left an old Room Service menu card that the previous guest had filled up, and on our last evening while we were packing and checking to make sure we hadn't left anything, there were 3 pieces of old chewed-up gum under my bed! This, even after we left a tip everyday for the housekeeper. The bathroom was very standard, but I liked that the shower had good water pressure and they had complimentary toiletries from Bath and Body Works that were replenished everyday.We were there on business and the meeting room was set up nicely, with complimentary glass-bottled water from Norway and mints in tins for each person. The food was pretty good but not particularly remarkable. We had breakfast at The Palace and the Ritz-Carlton on other days and those were truly spectacular, but those hotels are also three times more expensive so I suppose you get what you pay for.Some good points of the hotel are that there's two Starbucks outlets, a full cafe on the ground floor and a kiosk on the 8th floor lobby level, and there's a sizeable gym with plenty of treadmills - although since my schedule was so full and my leisure time spent shopping, I didn't actually get to use it.The worst thing about this hotel was the service. Check-in was unfriendly and without a smile. One bellhop in particular seemed angry at me when I asked him to take my luggage for storing, then I had to ask for it back because my group wasn't going out just yet. He and one more bellhop, a woman, wouldn't leave unless we started digging in our pockets for tips. We also had dinner at The View, the revolving restaurant on the 48th floor. The best thing about it was the novelty of it being a revolving restaurant in NYC. Otherwise, there were rips in some of the seats, the food was good but not great, and we once again got haughty service from their male receptionist.Still, it is overall not a bad hotel and I would recommend it, but try going there when there are fewer people - maybe then their staff wouldn't seem so overworked from handling hundreds of guests the whole day."
45,1881,"Oct 1 2009 	Awesome location - great hotel	I've been to NYC so many times and stayed at The Marquis recently when I took my brother on his first trip to the US. Normally I'd stay downtown in SoHo or TriBeCa or LES.However, this hotel is great if you're visiting NYC for the first time and need a base in which to visit all the sights. Right in the heart of Times Square, you really know and feel you're in New York what with all the neon lights, cabs and masses of people. (Being a city person the amount of people didn't phase me - but it may not be to everyone's taste esp if you have kids and/or pushchairs.) It's just 3 blocks from a subway station which takes you uptown or downtown so easy to get to all the major landmarks and museums and also walking distance to 5th Avenue for the shopping (it's just a healthy walk to Macys too).The hotel itself is massive - they host conferences there too so expect to see suits as well as tourists.You can't go wrong with a Marriott and the the elevators alone are worth staying at this place for. The staff and the standard of service were great especially considering just how many people stay there. We had a double and it was a great size (make sure you ask for Times Square view - the Hudson side is OK but the T Sq one is &quot;wow&quot;).It also has a funky and modern 24 hour gym with enough equipment to suit even the hardest gym bunny. No waiting for that running machine.Room service charges are in line with anywhere else - ie Don't do it . Get out and hit the numerous eateries in Manhatten (and the bars)I'll definitely stay here again when I take someone on their first trip to NYC."
46,1881,"Sep 25 2009 	Right in the heart of the action	The hotel is brilliantly situated right on Times Square, and is within easy walking distance of Empire State Building, Rockefella Center, Central Park, Macys and the subway to the whole of New York! The room we had was huge and the staff were helpful and friendly. The glass lifts are amazing! Breakfast in the hotel is EXPENSIVE as is room service but there are loads of places to eat round about. My husband is in a wheelchair and the hotel had easy access."
47,1881,"Sep 24 2009 	No apologies - it's the best!!	I've read the reviews - most are favourable; some not so, For us, our second time in two years, it's the best. We love the Marriott Marquis, mainly because its feeling of sheer space. What other hotel can boast an area like the eighth floor - reception, restaurants, bars, shops, concierge, theatre booking desk, American Express, desk Starbucks and stil have plenty of space to walk round. The rooms are spacious and the staff helpful and friendly. Its situation could not be better - right in the midst of Times Square. We have travelled all over the world, stayed in hostels and five star hotels but the Marriott Marquis remains our favourite."
48,1881,"Sep 23 2009 	Times Square Location	Stayed at this Hotel for 2 nights in September. The location of the hotel is the best feature, Times Square is on your doorstep and the subway system to most other parts of NYC is about 5 mins walk. The hotel is ideal for leisure visitors to New York and if you have not visited NYC before this is a perfect hotel to explore the city from.The Hotel elevators are cool and we did not have to wait more than a couple of minutes at busy times. The Hotel also has a Starbucks, gift shop and Theatre ticket office (Theatre ticket discount booth is across the road from hotel in Times Square) .I would recommend spending a bit more money on this hotel due to the great location - especially for 1st visitors or leisure visitors with limited time in NYC.Hotel rooms were spacious and clean and large enough for 2/3 adults - I was staying in one room with 3 other adults and this was fine but space would have been an issue for longer than 2 nights."
49,1881,"Sep 22 2009 	Marvellous Marriott Marquis	Excellent hotel situated on Times Square. WE had an amazing view overlooking the Square and Broadway. The room was spacious, significantly larger than other NY hotels I've stayed in such as Thirty Thirty or the Hudson. Experienced no problems whatsoever with elevators unlike some other reviewers. Everything you would want is in walking distance or just hail a cab.Would definately stay here again and currently first choice compared to other NY hotels"
50,1881,Sep 22 2009 	Best New Year Ever...!!!	I went to New York for NYE 2008/2009 I was also celebrating my 21st Birthday and had always wanted to spend it in the big apple.. After months and years of planning we booked to go here and the on the day it started brilliant as it was my Birthday we got a free upgrade on the plane.. and after hitting some traffic on the way to the hotel from the airport we hit some traffic due to roads being shut off for new year celebrations. We was there for 5 nights 6 days and it was the best trip EVER on arrival at the hotel we were greated and served straight away we got a room and had our bags taken up to our rooms... WOW the interior is amazing and it so HUGE!!! Rooms were spacious and had huge windows to look out of although our view was not as good. We never had any problems what so ever with any of the staff our noise and it was in the perfect location right ontop of times square... I would recommend this hotel highley and will be coming back again but saving it for a special occasion as its expensive and very specail treat.. !!!
51,1881,"Sep 19 2009 	Go With a High Floor	I've stayed here before and will likely stay here again on business. Nice central location right in the middle of Times Square. The Marriott Marquis seems like a huge hotel, but the staff is accommodating, pleasant, and competent. When I first arrived, the desk clerk upgraded me to a very large corner room on the 39th floor with an excellent view of the Hudson River and the Intrepid. Unfortunately, there was a fair amount of traffic next door (no fault of the hotel's) and I wanted a good night's sleep, so I asked to be switched to a different room. The hotel was very accommodating... they didn't have anything comparable on a high floor, but moved me to a much quieter room on the 34th floor - much quieter even though it looked directly out onto Times Square. Probably best to stick with high floors in this central city location if you are a light sleeper. Nice big flat screen TVs in both rooms, as well as sofas and armchairs.I didn't care for the room service dinner (nachos and a Cuban sandwich). The food was hot enough and the service was fine; I just didn't like the food much. Will go out next time and save some money."
52,1881,"Sep 17 2009	Right in the middle of everything	My daughter and I travelled to New York from London for the first time two weeks ago. We chose a Marriott as we had stayed in them in the UK and knew they were of a good standard..We were not disappointed. We had a room on the 19th floor which was clean and spacious, two double beds, an excellent shower in the bathroom, and a wide screen. TV. The only thing I would say is that the room and the bathroom could have done with a new coat of paint in places. And being a tea drinker, it would have been nice to have had a kettle in the room, not just a coffee maker.( Perhaps i could have got one if I had asked though.) A fridge would also have been nice. But these are very minor issues.We were offered an upgrade at $50 a night for a Times Square view, but declined.We ate breakfast twice in the Atrium restaurant in the hotel but this was pretty expensive, although the food was very good. Most other days we ate across the road at Juniors which was also good and much cheaper.On our last night we ate in the revolving restaurant on the 47th floor, what a great experience.!There are two Starbucks in the hotel which we made use of, also a ticket agency andanother office which booked trips for you. The business centre was open 24hours and we could use the internet in there.I have to say, coming from the UK, that the level of customer service we recieved in the USA was exemplary. People serving you in shops. restaurants and in the hotel were always friendly, polite, helpful, and made you feel you were important , this is something that many customer service operatives in England could learn from, so well done America!!I thought NY was wonderful and we hope to go back next year for Xmas shopping. I will definitely consider returning to the Marriott and would thoroughly recommend it."
53,1881,"Sep 15 2009 	Marriott Marquis is a fantabulous hotel!!!	This is our 3rd time staying at the Marquis!!! This hotel is nice, centrally located in the heart of Times Square and my 2 kids ages 10 &amp; 13 really enjoy it especially the elevators. We checked in 4 hours early and were able to check in early w/ upgrade to a 39th floor Times Square view for free. The room is average size and works for a family of four. Big windows w/ our view of Times Square, the ball and partial view of the Hudson River. Slept well and rarely if ever heard our neighbors or the craziness in Times Square!! We stayed 3 nights and find that the hotel is convenient to everything by subway, taxi or walking distance. We drove there but parked our car acrossed the street for $35/day at Icon rather than a $65/day at the Marriott!! Also used the fitness center and it is very nice w/ a great view on the 22nd floor!! The hotel staff was friendly enough. We went to Starbucks in the hotel and to The View Restaurants for drinks one night before sunset &amp; another night we had the dessert buffet for $17.95. I recommend staying here if you have never before or if you are w/ a family who has children. Times Square is fabulous but soooo busy &amp; touristy would love to stay on the Upper Eastside or in Soho/Greenwich Village next time!!! Overall I give Marriott Marquis 2 thumbs up!!"
54,1881,"Sep 13 2009 	Excellent location; beutiful NYC hotel	The hotel is right on Times Square. Everything you need is just minutes away (walking) Rooms are spacious, clean and well equiped. The room is large enough for families (2 adults 2 children) As it is a business hotel the rooms are well equiped including a free safe. The view from the room is stunning as we were on 42nd floor and had a view on Times Square. Most important: rooms are quiet. The only thing you sometimes coukd here was the vacuum toilet from the guestroom above. All other sounds couldn't be heared.You can skip the breakfast buffet. It's quiet expensive and nothing special. It's not bad though but I would advise toe go to a restaurant nearby. There are plenty. This hotel is also excellent for thatre visits as it is in the heart of the theatre district and has one theatre of itself.Enjoy your stay here!"
55,1881,"Sep 8 2009 	What a view	We were here for the Labor Day weekend and to celebrate our 20th anniversary. I told the employee that checked us in this, and we were upgraded to a Times Square view (we were using reward points for the stay, and there was no additional charge - normally it would be an extra $50 per night). Our room was very nice, large, with a sitting area with a couch, chair, and ottoman. The flat screen tv is visible from the sitting area and the bed (but not the bathroom). The bathroom is a little crowded for two people. The bed was also very comfortable. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants there on the property, but ate a Junior's (across the street) twice. I take that back, we did have Starbucks one morning, but I'm not sure that would count as a hotel restaurant. The elevators are unique in that you punch into a keypad the floor number of your room, and an elevator is assigned to you. When you get inside the elevator, there are no buttons to push, it just stops on your floor. The hotel is very convenient to everything, and there are subway stops nearby for sights outside of walking distance."
56,1881,"Sep 1 2009 	A top-level Marriott ONLY because of location	The Marriott Marquis is considered (by Marriott) to be a top-level hotel. It is not. It is large, it is located right on Times Square, it is crowded, it is filled with conventioneers, and it is very ordinary and forgettable. Nothing horrible happened, it's just that Marriott should knock this property down a couple of levels. It definitely does NOT compete with their luxurious ocean resorts. I guess, as they say about real estate, this hotel is about location, location, location."
57,1881,Aug 31 2009 	I like this hotel	What can I say? This is an excellent hotel right in the centre of all the New York action. We had just arrived from a transatlantic cruise and checked into the 42nd floor directly eye-level with the New Years Ball on Times Square. We stayed 2 nights and used the HoHo bus to see all of Manhattan. I can't believe that anyone would have complained about the elevator system in this hotel. I believe that it is a phenomenal piece of engineering and is ideal for a building of this size. I would definitely stay at this hotel again the next time I am in New York City.
58,1881,Aug 31 2009 	Excellent Hotel with location location location. (Time square)	First trip to New York City with my spouse and 19 year old daughter. Hotel is right in Times Square and close to ALL attractions of the City. Upon check in WE were treated like royalty and very professional. Our room was up very high (43rd floor) over looking Time Square and Broadway. Awesome view. Room was comfortable and very clean. Refrigerator was delievered upon request. We found the STAFF very professional and attentive to our needs and requests. Only downfall is that this is a business and convention type hotel and when hosting events the atrium seating area and interior resturants are busy with conventioneers and business people.
59,1881,Aug 31 2009 	Great Spot in Manhatten	Loved the location of this hotel - stayed in 1 room with 2 queens with a 2yo and 4yo. the Biggest toys r us ever seen across the road. Great access to broadway musicals.. I love NYC... and cant wait to get back..
60,1881,"Aug 29 2009 	Great Location! Great Hotel!	My teenage daughter and I spent a night at the Marriott Marquis for a mother/daughter weekend. We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and the wonderful, helpful and cordial staff. The room was very clean and large. We had a partial view of Time Square. We were amazed that with so much happening outside, the room was relatively quiet. We saw West Side story which was conveniently located across the street. The location of this hotel is incredible. The only downside is that the restaurant closes at 9:00 PM, which was early for a Friday night. However, there is always Juniors right across the street with great burgers and desserts! We will definetely stay here again."
61,1881,"Aug 25 2009 	Location	The only thing this hotel has going for it is a great location - just a 1/2 block from Times Square and with a theatre in the building. ( 9 to 5 was playing. Got a tix at the TKTS booth and enjoyed a great show.) The staff was OK, rooms were small and grossly overpriced, but hey, it's Manhattan, so stay some place cheaper and use the cash you save to see a couple of Broadway shows."
62,1881,"Aug 23 2009 	Perfect Location	My daughter treated me and my 9 yr old grandchild to our first trip to NYC.We arrived 2 hrs before check in and was unpacking in less than 20 minutes. We had a very nice room on the 41st floor with a wonderful view of Times Square, It was amazing with all the brightness but the curtains blocked it all out when it was time to sleep. Beds were comfortable and room was clean. Rooms were quiet except I did hear &quot;muffled&quot; voices when in the bathroom in the AM from the room next door. Nothing big enought to complain about , tho. Did not have the problems with elevators listed in some reviews. Another patron there said she stayed there a few yrs back and they have been fixed. Longest wait time maybe 10 minutes one time when extremely busy. We tried the dessert bar in the revolving restaurant which was yummy and fun!Again I cannot say enough about the location. We only had to take a cab to and from the airport. The rest of the time we were able to walk to out planned activiites including broadway shows. ( all were only a few blocks away.) The street in front of the hotel is blocked off and there is tables and chairs and also a lit staduim type seating area to soak in the views. The hotel is located a block away from where the ball drops on New Years Eve. We stayed 5 days and here are a few family friendly suggestions from our itinerary :http://www.onboardnewyorktours.com/ny-see-it-all/ ( well worth the $ - buy the kids their own disposable cameras- good for older kids.- Plan all day for this - it was only a block and 1/2 to meet the van . We did the 10:00AM- Returned close to 5 :00PM went straight to Planet Hollywood was seated immediately- , went back to hotel and freshened up and walked across the street to stt The Little Mermaid ( ordered tix will call before trip) Whew! See what I mean about LOCATION!http://www.madametussauds.com/newyork/ ( very cool- had fun posing with all the stars- next door to Riplys )http://www.marvelouswonderettes.com/ ( Hells Kitchen area- got discount tix from someone handing out flyers and it was a great show.) We were able to walk to the wax Museum, Joes Pizza , and to this show the same day. Checked out the MTV store, M&amp;M, Hereshey Stores that evening which are all right by the hotel. NOTE: Crowds definately get verrrry thick when walking Times Square at night. http://www.johnspizzerianyc.com/index2.htm - (cheap and yummy brick oven pizza- quick service- no soda refills) http://restaurantrow.name/media/restaurantrow.html ( close by hotel lots to choose from) http://www.nytheatre.com/nytheatre/kids.phphttp://www1.toysrus.com/TimesSquare/dsp_home.cfmhttp://www1.toysrus.com/TimesSquare/popups/dsp_marquee_moment.cfm ( grandchild did this and loved it) http://www.planethollywood.com/restaurants_newYork.htm ( good food - loud music- fun for kids- across from hotel)I would definately stay at this hotel again!"
63,1881,"Aug 20 2009 	Great hotel great location	We booked a room on the recommendation of a friend, and were not disappointed. The rooms were clean and up-to-date, the exercise facility was top-notch, and the hotel is right in the middle of all the action in Times Square. Our interactions with the front-desk staff and concierge were all positive. This is the only hotel we'll consider staying at when we return to NYC."
64,1881,"Aug 19 2009 	Wonderful Stay!	Stayed at this hotel on a girls trip to the city for Mother's Day Weekend. We had a Times Square View room with an excellent view from the 17th floor. The room was a little small for 4 adults with only 1 bathroom, but was only in room for shower and sleeping. Loved the location, walk out of the hotel to food and best of all the energy of Times Square. Easy to get a taxi from hotel or private car service, there was a hop on hop off bus stop close by and subway station. The View (hotel restaurant's) Sunday Brunch on Mother's Day had excellent food and an amazing selection for all tastes. The staff was friendly and polite. We called for extra towels early on the first evening and did not receive them until after 1AM, but no big deal, we got the towels. We had a wonderful trip and would stay here again!"
65,1881,"Aug 19 2009 	Mega Marriott	Huge, but that's to be expected. It's at the hub of all things tourist...Times Square. No complaints about that! We pre booked and specified &quot;upper floor/no feathers/quiet room&quot;. Arrived and disinterested hotel staff person &quot;Stephanie&quot; told us that we were on FLoor 45. Cool. I asked for quiet room, i reminded her, so no adjoining doors. She cooly informed me that there was an adjoining door (there were in fact two, one on each side of the room, but I'm getting ahead of myself...) but that it lead to the PResidential Suite and that meant quiet patrons. I had misgivings but she was getting snarky, told me the hotel, all 45 floors was totally sold out, so we went upstairs. Got into the room and realized that it was actually a bedroom for the PResidential Suite and that the Suite was the hospitality suite for a huge conference I was attending. I wondered if that would mean non stop noise but thought I'd wait and see. Around 7:30 the party got underway and got louder and louder. Because of the &quot;adjoining door&quot; it was like they party was in my room. I called downstairs. SUddenly...they had another room on the 31st floor. We were told to wait for a key. After about 20 minutes, someone used a key and entered the room without knocking. Turns out it was HEad of Housekeeping, Ditha, who was as shocked as we were. She apologized profusely, explaining she'd been told by Front Desk to check the room for guests. When we explained the problem, she called someone, told them she was taking us to the new room on FLoor 31 and insisted on helping with our bags. We got to the new room which of course had feather bedding (I'm terribly allergic) and she insisted on heading down to supplies and personally bringing non feather bedding back up. A bell man delivered a key to us and Ditha returned. I helped her make the bed and when I tried to tip her...she refused the money. So what can I say...some of the staff are lovely and some are useless and snippy. Welcome to NEw York. The hotel was exactly as you'd expect otherwise. Room on 31st floor had king bed, couch and armchair, desk, flat screen TV...larger than I expected and we were just so pleased to have WALLS. Avoid Room 4537, it's got those two adjoining doors on opposite sides. OH...and don't be shocked...but they actually CHARGE for internet. I expect more amenities from a mega hotel like this one."
66,1881,"Aug 18 2009 	Wonderful hotel in a great location	Brief summary: I've stayed here before and was pleasantly surprised with the renovations and some changes. The location is always very good if you are interested in the theater, subway a short walk away, right in Times Square. I'd stay here again.Our room was on the top floor, 4501 (or 03?) had a view of the Hudson and was billed as a &quot;quiet room.&quot; Yes, it was quiet in general, but if you listened hard, you could hear some soft sqeeks of the service (not public) elevator that cut into some of the room space. I think that rooms with the number 53 (or 63?) might have a similar location on the other side of the elevator shafts. Still, this was a pretty quiet room and spacious enough, and probably the default location for people booking with award points.The housekeeping was excellent and staff throughout the hotel was very friendly and professional. The concierges may be a little overworked, but they are helpful and can supply more tourist information, subway maps, etc.The room has all of the amenities that one expects of a recently renovated business class hotel, i.e. ironing board, toiletries, duvet-style bedding (with a top sheet, thank goodness, so we didn't have to crank up the AC ro be comfortable,) etc. Good closet and drawer space. I really appreciated the oversize in-room safe that can accomodate a laptop as well as other valuables. The tub/shower is a traditional standard size, which was fine by me since I have tired of the jacuzzi-size tubs at inns where I;ve recently stayed, and that seem to take forever to fill. Lots of counterspace in the bathroom.Check-in was fast, but it was not very busy. Similarly, the hotel was not empty, but I've seen it busier. The elevators handled any crowd very well with a new gizmo where you keyin the floor you want, and a code appears that shows where the next elevator to that destination will arrive. Unless you really don't like heights, everyone seems to enjoy the glass elevators that are their own entertainment.I've been in the hotel's lobby many times, often before the theater for cocktails and a clean place to go to the bathroom before the show. It was nice to see the addition of a Starbuck's on the 8th floor lobby for a relatively inexpensive breakfast close by, as well as one at ground floor level. It seems that they don't mind your taking breakfast to the cocktail lounge area in the morning, but that area turns into a cocktail lounge later in the day.We didn't use the gym facilities, but it looks pretty nice with a great view of the city.Again, the irritation: in-room internet access requires a fee. It feels like nickle-and-diming.So: this may not be one of those unique charming boutique hotels, but it has not failed to deliver a very good night's rest right in the center of things."
67,1881,"Aug 18 2009 	Great location!	Wonderful hotel in center of everything. Although it was expensive, we all know it's all about location, location, location! The Concierge gave us a recommendation and reservation for an affordable italian restaurant for our family. It was delicious! The fitness center was more than adequate.The breakfast buffet was included in the price of the room."
68,1881,"Aug 16 2009 	right in the heart of things	stayed here with my family for four nights. funny but very nice hotel. when trying to find the hotel it appeared through a sort of tunnel which lead to the ground foyer where there was a cold feel to it we were told to go to the 8th floor to check in . check in staff we sort of helpful and directed us to our room on the 34th floor . our ears popped when travelling up in the lift. we got out and it was so clean and quiet, very relaxing after coming through the foyer with people darting around . our room was comfortable with lovely views over times square. we ate in the view which was slightly dissappointing the food was nice but not worth the price. dishes were very small as they didnt want us to take too much and they put us on the smallest table they could find. the bill came to 155 dollars and that was just for 2 adults and 2 children with no tip!! would not recommend.nice hotel lifts get busy and have to hang around at busy times, hotel priced like any 4 star hotel in new york very clean, large,quiet rooms and very central to most tourist landmarks. would i stay there again yes."
69,1881,"Aug 13 2009 	Another Great Stay	When we visit NYC we almost always choose Marriott marquis! Marriott usually offers some great deals and their cancellation policy is the same day as arrival. The hotel is very upscale and clean. The rooms are a fair size for NYC and the lounge area is a great place to meet friends and hang out. The location is great for all of your travel needs in NYC. The elevators are an adventure and the ride up and down is very entertaining. I would choose the Marriott Marquis, if available, again and again!"
70,1881,"Aug 9 2009 	Terrific times at the Marriott in the square	Picked this hotel from reading other reviews on trip advisor and wasn't dissapointed. The hotel is beautiful and very nice - great location next to the theatres. The service was fine - nothing special but that's fine by me. The room was large for NYC and even had a little sitting area with chair/automan, love seat etc. I expected the room to be much smaller for the big apple so I was pleasently suprised. The room was clean and things were in order - no obvious chips,stains or scratches on anything - a little pealing wall paper but still nice. I enjoyed the comfortable bed, nice linens and big LCD TV. I felt very safe in this hotel as we are talking NYC and that was a huge plus.Yes, Times Square is VERY crowded but if you want to get out of that area the subway is just a block or so down the way. I enjoyed being able to hang out in times square and Rockefeller Center late in the evenings without dreding a long ride back to the hotel. This is an expensive hotel but we used Marriott points combined with the AAA discounts and it was cheaper. A little warning though - you should probably add $40 to the rate you get as this is how much hotel, city ,etc taxes are a night.People have complained in some of the reviews about the elevators but we had no trouble with them. That might be because we were on the 10th floor and maybe didn't have to wait as long as someone on a higher floor but I didn't hear any complaints.Didn't like that wi-fi was so expensive but that's typical for an upscale hotel. I thought wi-fi was free in common areas but when I asked they said it was not.All in all - I'd stay here again in a heart beat."
71,1881,"Aug 8 2009 	perfect location	We just got back from a great stay at the Marriot Marquis, The location is perfect. They upgraded us to time square veiw for 50.00 a night and gave me a free night for my birthday. Room was large and very clean. Did have a issue with sqeeky pipes when next room took a shower they took 100.00 of our upgraded bill, so what to complain about.... The staff is wonderfull and always helped with any thing we needed, directions, comedy tickets. The place is fabulous........nice large bathroom also. Ate at the the veiw had the buffet it wasnt very good for the price.... Lobby is so fun and the elevators we never waited or had any trouble with them..."
72,1881,"Aug 8 2009 	Had an outstanding stay here!	I spent four nights at the Marriott Marquis NYC at the beginning of June 2009 and was absolutely impressed. I had booked a Times Square view room via a AAA special, and when I got to the room and found a mediocre south-facing view I was able to talk to the manager on duty and promptly and politely changed to a jetliner view room on a high floor facing directly north into Times Square. One of those views to die for. The room itself was large, clean and had all the expected amenities and the staff I met, no matter the department, was polite and friendly. The location is as perfect as it gets. The elevator situation was not a problem at all during my stay as I rarely waited more than a few minutes for one, and the hotel seemed fairly crowded. Overall I found the Marriott to be outstanding in every respect and would not hesitate to stay here again (and will probably do so on all my future visits to NYC).Ken Ackerman"
73,1881,"Aug 7 2009 	GREAT LOCATION	We stayed in this hotel for our daughter 13-th Birthday.Location is absolutly GREAT.All staff was friendly and helpfull,check in and out was very easy.Loved the lifts and room with a Times Square view.Everything in a walking distance from this hotel and you can feel high energy from Times Square.Thank you Marriott Marquis for GREAT time."
74,1881,"Aug 7 2009 	Great Location!!	If you can afford it, stay here!! The rooms are pretty expensive ($270+ a night) but it's worth it to able to walk out of your hotel right into Times Square!! This hotel is near top notch restaurants, the theatre district, and the subway is not a far walk at all. The rooms are of average size. It's a huge place and pretty busy. The staff was always very helpful. The restaurant in the hotel is pretty expensive so I would try some of the local cuisine if you are up for walking before I spend my money here. I hope to go back soon!!"
75,1881,"Aug 7 2009 	Very Nice Hotel... Very Crowded	This hotel has everything you would expect from a Marriott... beautiful interior, clean, well appointed rooms, good service. As mentioned in the other reviews, the elevators are interesting and unique. At the bank of elevators, you press the floor you want and it tells you the letter of the elevator to wait for. This is lovely, except during busy periods where you find more people waiting in front of elevator &quot;N&quot; than can actually fit in elevator &quot;N&quot;. We chose this particular hotel, not only for the location, but because it was one of the few Marriotts in the area that has an executive lounge. As Platinum members, my partner and I look forward to having a relatively quiet breakfast each morning in the lounge. If this would be one of your reasons for choosing this hotel... don't bother. The lounge was a zoo every morning! There was always a line for the hot food and the lounge (three times the size of a &quot;normal&quot; Mariott Executive Lounge) was filled with loud children running all over the place. One morning, there was literally no place to sit and we had to wander around with our food, stalking those who looked like they might be almost finished. As Marriott members who have been turned away from lounges in the past because they &quot;were at capacity&quot;, that definitely didn't seem to be a concern for the management at this hotel. There seemed to be no limit to the amount of people they were letting in the lounge. If you don't care about the lounge and like the excitement and crowds of people near Times Square... then this is a fun hotel to stay at for a trip to NYC."
76,1881,"Aug 5 2009 	Great Location	Went to NYC for a family get together with relatives from outside the tristate area. Although we live in CT, we prefer not to have to drive home late at night. One room we had overlooks Time Square and the other the pier where the cruise ships depart from. This hotel is a fabulous, safe location in Time Square. Although it is not cheap, it has just about everything you could want for. Valet parking is offered so from the very start of the trip, we relaxed. The hotel has shopping, Starbucks, beautiful lounges which look out to Time Square, restaurants, etc. We were able to walk to Rockefeller Center &amp; st. Patrick's Cathedral, Carmine's Restaurant, and a comedy show. We have stayed here in the past and enjoyed our visit as much this time."
77,1881,"Aug 3 2009 	Awesome hotel	Stayed here for 1 week for sons wedding in Central Park.Fantastic location,with a Times Square view room.Cannott fault this hotel,everything was A1.Loved the lifts,which were easy to use,and never had to wait.Check in/check out ...fast and efficient, Rooms spacious and very clean,Staff lovely and friendly.Had a full buffet in the Revolving restaurant...a bargain at $35 and what a view,highly recommend to everybody.We always had breakfast at Juniors across the road,which was always busy but great service and food.I would stay at this hotel everytime in New York,the beds are awesome and super comfortable,just what you need after a busy day.I absolutely loved my stay at the Marriott Marquis,and look forward to returning in the future"
78,1881,"Aug 3 2009 	Huge Impersonal Hotel	I would not stay at this hotel again. The ONLY thing going for it is the location next to Broadway theaters. If we had not ventured far away from this hotel, I would not consider returning to NYC. Times Square is dirty, noisy and, with the new pedestrian mall that blocks traffic off parts of Broadway Ave. (while sounding good), it only makes congestion worst. Most nights, it took us over 20 minutes in a cab just to get around the block and out of the area to get to the good restaurants in the city. The staff at the hotel is hit and miss; some will greet you while others will ignore you. The Elite check-in for Platinum Members is a joke. After staying the week on business, we stayed the weekend on points, and the staff didn't know how to handle the reservation. The gal at Elite check-in was rude when I explained I needed to get the key redone because I was told we had a new reservation. She demanded to know who had told me that. Then she told me to ignore them. Sure enough, the key didn't work when I went back upstairs. We finally got that mess straighten up. Twice, the valet lost my husband's car in the garage. The hotel room was O.K. - the flat screen T.V.s are an improvement, but I would not consider the rooms renovated as they have just put granite over old vanities and updated the mirrors and facets. The rest of the bathroom was old, with broken tiles on the floor and mold on the tiles in the shower. Bathtub was chipped in many places. If you want to listen to your neighbors, just spend some time in the bathroom and you can hear every conversation in the next room, including every bodily function. Much has been said about the elevators, and while they are efficient, the lobby on the ground floor is ugly and inconvenient with the backs of the elevators facing out which you have to walk around to get to the keypad. Poorly designed. I could go on, but I won't. Find another hotel in a nicer part of the city. New York is fantastic."
79,1881,"Aug 2 2009 	Overall a good experience. Icky housecleaning though and loud.	Overall, we had a really positive experience. The location was fabulous. We had two &quot;Times Square View&quot; rooms but there was a giant billboard in front of our window that obscured the view but we still enjoyed the view. The concierge was really helpful, impressively so. For a small fortune, we were able to get tickets to Billy Elliot for the same night by using the Marriott broker. The man at the booth was very helpful and funny. The room service was delicious. We are vegetarians and their veggie burger was one of the best we've ever had. The room service staff also offered to make us anything they had ingredients for. We didn't take them up on the offer but it was still pretty nice to know. The only downside (aside from the big billboard obstructing our view) was the cleaning. I might not have noticed were it not for the fact that my son lost a part of a toy and I went crawling around on the floor looking for it. I never found the part but I found gum stuck to the side of the bed (my kids don't chew gum so it wasn't us!) and under the bed and the corners of the room were really pretty disgusting. Believe me when I tell you that I am NOT a neat freak, it was just that dirty and dusty. I would be worried for people with dust allergies. Also, my husband had problems sleeping because of the sirens and street noise."
80,1881,Jul 31 2009 	Great Location	Stayed for birthday/shopping trip. The location was great and I found the lift system easy to manage. On arrival due to jetlag we went to bed early but were kept awake with what sounded like a heating system - reception moved us straight away with no trouble. As its so big we had very little interaction with staff for our entire stay and it felt very like staying in an apartment. Great to be right in the centre of Times Square but theres probably better value to be had a couple of blocks away.
81,1881,"Jul 30 2009 	At the Center of the NYC Universe	Stayed for just one quick night while waiting for a flight home. If you only have one night (or two) to spend in NYC, here is the perfect location in the middle of it all - Broadway, the Theatre District and close to everything else. My request for a high floor (41 out of 45) was honored without question and we had a nice view of Times Square. The rooms were very nice. The gym is well-equipped. There are several restaurants onsite and two Starbucks. The hotel is also home to the only revolving restaurant in NYC. While we didn't eat there, a friend recently did and she said it was a very special experience. If you can get a good rate, by all means try to stay here even if for only one night."
82,1881,"Jul 29 2009 	Great Times Square location and proximity to all we wanted to see in New York City.	Having driven all over the world, New York City driving was a breeze to me, but the GPS does not reflect construction sites and re-routes. However, I do recommend Marriott Rewards membership to be able to enjoy comfortable accommodations like these at reasonable prices or great upgrades."
83,1881,"Jul 24 2009 	Location Location Location; Exceeded all expectations	I know so many people say: &quot;you're in NYC so you don't spend much time in your room,&quot; but the time you do spend there is very comfortable. The beds were comfortable to sleep in - where we got the much needed sleep and rest that we needed for our long days. The room was roomy and the view was terrific. Even with all the hustle and bustle outside, the room was quiet!And being right in the middle of Time Square you are close to so much. We had a blast and the hotel helped us to enjoy our stay.The staff was excellent; they went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. When asking for the best shows, they gave lots of personal recommendations; when asking about specific things we were looking for, they were able to provide the answers; when we checked out, but still needed to leave our bags there for the day while we continued sight-seeing, they were very accomodating; they were very friendly when extending our check-out time; and I could go on. When asking for directions to specific venues, everyone from the staff to the security people were willing and ready to help. Take the bus tour! You can get on/off for a couple of days and you get to see so much and get a &quot;lay of the land&quot; so you better decide what you want to do."
84,1881,"Jul 24 2009 	Affordable Comfort in NYC	After staying in the Pod Hotel in NYC for 3 nights before moving to the Marquis, this was exactly what I'd been hoping for and it was like pure lusury in comparison to the hole we were staying in. Quick check in and then a super fast lift to the 14th floor in to our huge room - it was massive. The bathroom at the Marquis was bigger than the entire room at the Pod! Views out over Time Square, a super large bed that was so comfy and plush it was an effort to force ourselves to get up! After a hard day of lots of walking and shopping in the cold, this room was great to come back to and get a good nights sleep in preparation to do it all again. Went up to the revolving bar a couple of evenings for the yummiest coctails while getting the best views out over the city - just a bit of a killer when you've had a few too many to get down in the lift which is so fast iss quite disorientating. Outside the entrance is a place to buy cheap show tickets and whilst the queues may look long, they move really quickly and is well worth the wait. I couldnt go to New York and not watch Chorus Line - for the sake of a 35min wait, I got to see it for less than half price with great seats. Location of hotel is fantastic - right in Time Square with all the theatres, great restaurants and macy's only a short walk away. For a gimmicy meal we went to Bubba Gump Shrimp and was really pleasantly surprised and you have to go to Johns Pizza place a road from the hotel - simply the best pizza I've ever had. After the hussle and bustle of NYC for a week you need a good hotel and this is well worth the money - would definately pick the Marquis for our next stay in New York."
85,1881,"Jul 22 2009	Great Location	This was right @ Times Square, so as you step out onto Broadway &amp; 7th Ave., you could feel the high energy. This place is bustling. Had a high floor - view room, so it was awesome watching the fireworks on the Hudson River on 4th of July. The room is a very good size for typical NY hotels. If you're looking for upbeat crowd and in the center of action - this would be one one."
86,1881,"Jul 21 2009 	Huge Hotel at great location - in the middle of Times Square	We stayed at the Marriott Marquis for 4 nights in July 2009.Chose it because of the location. Originally we had booked a hotel on Park Avenue but then re-decided because we wanted to be right in the middle of everything.Overall:We were satisfied with our stay and did not have mayor complaints. Marriott fulfilled our expectations since we knew what to expect. Years ago we had a look into the lobby so we knew its huge.Postive:LOCATION - LOCATION - LOCATION !Marriott Marquis is right on Broadway / Times Square. You just step out of the doors and you are in the middle of action. The Grey Line Tour buses start 2 minutes walk up broadway and the next subway station is 5 minutes to the other direction.Although the hotel looks ugly from the outside (80's style) it is very well maintained.Rooms are big and beds comfortable. Aircontion worlked perfectly and is silent, this is most important for us - we hate these window aircos making a lot of noise.We booked a times square view room on high floor and got a room on 35 floor with breathtaking view.Breakfast buffet was included in our rate (25 dollars surcharge per room compared to room only) and it was really worth it. Huge and good buffet -warm and cold selection. Nice restaurant on 8th floor - lobby level.There is a starbucks on 8th floor and one on street level if you just prefer to have coffee.The lobby shop offers stamps for postcards and letters. Staff there was really nice and helpful.Broadway bar on 8th floor has great view on Broadway and cocktails were very good.The lobby is really impressive, located on 8th floor it is open till 45 floor and you can see the glass elevator going up and down.Negative:There are only some minor issues to be mentioned.The bathroom looks a bit dated, but water pressure was OK and amenities offered are nice.It would be perfect if the hotel would offer a pool, especially in summer.At one night the Broadway bar was closed due to a private event, only the lobby bar without view open.SummaryAs i mentioned, do not expect any charm, the hotel is huge and the lobby has the atmosphere of a big train station.If you are looking for personal attention of staff or charming atmosphere you will not like this hotel.If you want to be in the middle of New York Action, do not fear thousands of people and want a good bed and perfect and silent air-condition, you will love this hotel."
87,1881,"Jul 18 2009 	Not perfect but - Great Location. Great Hotel.	This hotel could NOT have been in a better location for a family traveling with 4 teens/young adults (21,18,16,13). We had 2 adjoining rooms on the 17th floor with a GREAT view of Times Square. The 2 King rooms worked out nicely with the sofa beds and a roll-away!My on-going peeve with &quot;nice&quot; hotels (as opposed to economy hotels) is that they nickel and dime you for everything. COME ON! For $400+ per night per room, could you NOT throw in free wireless internet??? I mean seriously, raise my room price $17 and give it to me for free!!! Instead, we had to pay $17 (per room) per night and it wasn't even wireless... you had to sit, anchored to the desk, plugged in... ridiculous in 2009.Also, we paid a WAY higher price than a lot of people there who got excellent bargains... I think I would've been WAY happier paying $269 per night than $400+.The elevators we OK as long as it wasn't crowded... when the crowds picked up, it could take 15 minutes to get up to your room (or down to the first floor). But again, to walk out the doors and be in the loud, crazy, FUN, awake, glitzy, blinking Times Square - it was all worth it (especially for the kids!)"
88,1881,"Jul 15 2009 	Great Hotel 	We spent July 3-7 at the Marriott Marquis and had a wonderful stay. The service at the front desk, concierge, and housekeeping were all excellent. Though located in the heart of Times Square, it was very quiet and restful even on a holiday weekend. The room was very clean, spacious, and attractive. We were in NYC mainly for theater, so we didn't have time to use the amenities. We did have drinks at night at The View, the top floor rotating lounge/restaurant &amp; enjoyed the drinks &amp; the amazing view. We attended 5 shows in 2 days and this central location was such a time-saver and convenience for us. It's so close to theaters, subway, and within walking distance to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, and many other sites we wanted to see. We liked the location, cleanliness, and service the best. We can't really think of anything that we liked least. Great hotel-highly recommended for theater-goers."
89,1881,"Jul 14 2009	Best hotel in Manhattan	I cannot praise this hotel enough. I've traveled the world and stayed at what I thought were 5 star hotels. NONE of them came close to the Marquis. The service was the finest I have experienced. I found a deal -4th night free-and jumped at it. I've always wanted to stay here and I was NOT disappointed. From the room service to the staff,to the location,this is the hotel you'll want to stay at when you visit New York.....Do NOT hesitate here...But people please remember to treat others the way you would like to be treated, then no matter where you travel you will have a great time."
90,1881,"Jul 13 2009 	Perfect Location...when we come back we are staying at the Marriott Marquis again.	What a great hotel. It is located right in the heart of Times Square and within walking distance of most theatres, shopping, David Letterman (Ed Sullivan Theatre) etc.We booked a package with a standard room. I called a couple of days early and said that I would be interested in an upgrade. I didn't see the room that I would have received but I know it wouldn't have had the view that we had from our &quot;Times Square&quot; view room.It only cost us $50.00 a night more but it was worth it.I would also suggest that if you do upgrade that you request a fridge in your room. The rooms don't come with this but we were given one at no extra charge after upgrading. I think they said that the normal cost for a fridge was $25.00 a night.You'll want the fridge to keep your water and other refreshments cold. It's very humid in New York in July and you will be drinking a lot of water.The room itself had everything you need...a large LG television, couch, chair with footstool, king size bed ( I never slept better or longer ).We would turn the couch (hide a bed I think) around at night facing the large windows and just enjoy the view of Times Square while sipping on some red wine.The service in the hotel was amazing and always done with a smile. Actually the service at the shops and restaurants was excellent as well. As a Canadian I think our major centers like Calgary, Vancouver and Toronto could learn a lot about service within the &quot;service industries&quot; by going to New York!The elevators are unique both in how they are organized and how they look. It might take a few rides but you will get use to it. During the rush times it does take a while but be patient.I read a few reviews that said they had their rooms broken into. We didn't and we also had a safe in the closet. I don't know if the standard rooms had the safe but we made good use of it and no incidents.Tips:1. Go to Jersey Boys and pay extra for good seat it's worth every penny.2. Go to David Letterman. I went on line and requested a couple of dates just a week before we left. I got a call back and after answering a trivia question correctly we got front row seats. 3. If you get tickets to Letterman you have to be at the theatre around 2:00 p.m. We went to Angelo's Pizza which is right beside Letterman's and had a great pizza and bottle of wine at noon and it worked out perfect.4. Take in a Mets or Yankees game. We went to the Mets. I got my tickets at StubHub and they were perfect again....centre on the third base line about 25 rows up on the main level. I got some grear video of Manny as the L.A. Dodgers were playing. What a great stadium too!5. Take a tour on the Greyline buses 6. Use the subway as much as you can it is safe and always full of people.Not once did we feel unsafe walking around. Time Square police are all over the place.If you don't like crowds...don't go. If you like pizza, baseball and theatre....go."
91,1881,"Jul 8 2009 	Best place to stay at Times Square NYC	We have stayed at other hotels at Times Square, some much more expensive, but this one is a keeper. Perfect location and has everything we wanted, unlike some hotels that have a bar that does not serve food. We will go back to the Marriott Marquis every visit to New York."
92,1881,"Jul 7 2009 	As always Fabulous!	I stayed here with 3 teenage girls. We booked two rooms. When we checked in they didn't have any rooms close together only time square view rooms for an exra $100 I had requested this when making reservation months ago.. I wanted to keep an eye on them so I took the upgrade. Glad we did the view was incredible. I had a view in the past but it was kind of around a corner and you had to put your face up to the window to see times square. This was well worth the money.The girls were very impressed. We then went to the View lounge for dinner. The buffet was $32 a person . They served short ribs, chicken, salad,cheese pastas, asian shrimp,bread,desserts were included. We loved the chocolate fountain.I always stay at this hotel when in the city. I've stayed at others but this is the best deal.Rooms are quite big for NYC. Extremely convient location.It is also beautiful. The staff is first rate. I will always come back!"
93,1881,"Jul 5 2009 	Good Value Relative to Other Manhattan Hotels	My first reaction staying here was: &quot;Wow, what a lot of tourists!&quot; and was kind of worried that I'd be awake all night listening to people partying in their rooms, street noise, etc. But that wasn't the case. My room was on a high floor and well insulated against noise. You heard some stuff, but once you draw the curtains, the room is pretty dark and quiet allowing a good night's sleep.My second reaction is that the hotel is BIG. You walk into the lobby, look straight up and realize that there are something like 50 floors with what appear to be 100 rooms per floor. Probably not that much, nonetheless it's an impressive sight. There are glass elevators that go all the way up. Maybe a concern if you're acrophobic.Via the elite desk, check in was pretty fast. For guests without elite status, there was a line, but it seemed to be moving. At least, no one was grumbling ... not even a family with four kids.This hotel obviously gets a lot of traffic. The halls looked like they'd been redone in the past few years, but even so the rugs are getting dingy in high-traffic areas. I had a colleague with a room similar to mine and both showed wear (chipped counters, scratched furniture, etc.), though both were also very clean.Rooms were large relative to most New York hotels and included a king size bed (which was very comfortable), desk and work area, a couch, coffee table, separate chair with ottoman, large dresser, and still leave plenty of room to unpack and mill about. I ordered room service (where they brought in a trolley with the meal) with two colleagues and I working in the room; there was still room to move around, use the desk, sit on the couch, etc. I visit New York several times a year -- most hotel rooms are &quot;cozy&quot;, to use a kind word, even at &quot;luxury&quot; hotels. Usually there's barely enough room to open your suitcase.Room service was ok but not great. I used it several times and it was hit or miss. The food quality was fine, but the service was at times a little off. They made mistakes on at least one order, though they corrected it quickly.Internet service, workspace amenities, business center, fitness center, etc. were all pretty good. The hotel has everything except a pool. There are several restaurants ... I ate at the View which has a nice view of Times Square and one of the lobby restaurants. Both were fine.The hotel's highlight other than size and space is its location. It's right in the middle of Times Square which depending on your point of view is either really good or really bad. Even with the change in traffic patterns (i.e., the city shut down parts of Broadway and made them pedestrian zones), it's still very crowded -- packed with tourists. But it is convenient for midtown business, transportation, etc. and at a decent price. I got a corporate rate that was about $275 before tax.Overall, a pretty good hotel for the price relative to what's available in NYC."
94,1881,"Jul 4 2009 	Great location with amazing views.	I accompanied my husband, his colleagues and their wives to New York on 18.06.09. All of us, plus all of the other conference guests (300+), stayed in this hotel,which also hosted the event and several of the receptions.All in all I would most certainly recommend this hotel. It is in a great location and pretty central for most of the places we wanted to visit by cab or on foot.The rooms are spacious and kept very clean and tidy. They're not the most inspiring, but the beds are comfortable, the TV is huge and the tea &amp; coffee machine makes a decent brew. There were also complimentary newspapers outside the doors every morning.The staff were all very polite, friendly and helpful and I certainly didn't feel that this was in order to gain tips. This is my second trip to NYC and the staff this time were a credit to the hotel.Although we did not use the fitness centre, it looked really well equipped and well maintained.The food &amp; drink in the hotel were lovely but incredibly expensive. The views over Times Square from the Broadway Bar are amazing! Try the pizza, yumm!Ladies, do not limit yourselves to Macy's &amp; Bloomingdales - you must visit the Century 21 department store which is very much like an upmarket TK MAXX (all top designers &amp; brands like DKNY, Juicy Couture, Guess etc)!!!!!For a decent meal close to the hotel try the Blue Finn. Very trendy with great food and attentive staff. Do Juniors for breakfast and you're set for the day.On our final day we had booked a larger taxi back to the airport which the hotel had organised, we were pretty impressed when we came out to an upgrade at no extra cost which was a huge white stretch limo.If you get the chance to stay here, go for it - but New York is so fantasic wherever you end up I can't imagine not enjoying it."
95,1881,"Jul 2 2009 	Nice hotel...of course over-priced it's in the heart of Manhattan	I stayed here for 1 night, for a business trip &amp; was VERY occupied w/ the business...all conducted within the hotel. so no great recollection of many things about the hotel, but I can tell you:- The room was nice; think I had a King bed- No view worth remembering, which is disappointing when you're in Times Square- YOU ARE IN TIMES SQUARE. You're in THE heart of THE biggest/best city in the world. To say you're &quot;within walking distance&quot; of ANYTHING is an understatement. Restaurants, broadway, Central Park's not too far away, nor is anything else NYC has to offer. The location CANNOT be beat.- The food (lunch and Dinner at the affair I was attending) was good- Big ballrooms, big event rooms, well done- Easy cab drop-off and pick-up- Check-in/-out was easy, BUT there was a wait for both. This was a little annoying; I get it, this is a huge hotel in the world's biggest and best city, OK, fine. Just put more people on the front desk, will you?- They were all jazzed over their going &quot;paperless,&quot; so no paper bill received, which was nice / good to see.That's all I remember. Sorry, not a detailed review, but the rest must have been OK if it wasn't noteworthy/worth remembering.Bottom line: UNLESS you decide you MUST stay in Times Square, I'd find a cheaper hotel if you can...or try to find a good price for this one on your favorite search engine."
96,1881,"Jul 2 2009 	Great location in middle of Times Square	I love the location of this hotel - the view outside my window was directly onto Times Square. And being able to walk right out the front of the hotel and directly onto Times Square and all the nearby shops and restaurants is very convenient and not to mention quicker by not having to fight cab traffic. And if you do need to go somewhere, getting a cab is fairly easy. The hotel itself is nice, has a great restaurant and was pretty decent. Its definately not new, but my room was clean which is most important. The rooms were average Marriott rooms with bed and a nice chair and have everything you need. Besides with so much to do in the area, who wants to stay in the room? The elevator banks are interesting and how they assign you one that goes directly to your floor, rather than getting in and punching numbers is kind of cool. And the lobby is not on the ground floor, but once you figure all of that out, it's easy to get around."
97,1881,"Jul 2 2009 	Another great stay at the Marquis	Plain and simply the best hotel in Time Square. Best lobby bar in time square with the best TS views, roof top rotating restaurant bar, 40 story lobby atrium.....It is located right in the heart of time square. At check in I was given an upgrade to a suite which was an amazing blessing considering we were traveling with 2 toddlers. Everyone was professional and helpful. No more to be said. If your going to NY and want to be in the middle of it all, stay at the Marquis!"
98,1881,"Jun 30 2009 	We had a great experience at Marriott Marquis NYC	Great Location, nice large room, King bed. My son thought the elevators were like an amusement park ride. The staff was helpful and attentive. I would stay here again when traveling with my son"
