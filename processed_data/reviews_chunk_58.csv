89,1321,"Mar 3 2007 	Avoid this hotel at all costs	The rooms, location etc are irrelevant. The truth about this hotel is that THEY WILL STEAL FROM YOUR CREDIT CARD. We booked on the hotel website with one credit card. They immediately charged the full stay on that card. On checking in and showing another card, they charged that card the full stay too. We are four months into a battle which will probably end up in court to recover the double charge, which they flatly deny in the face of irrefutable evidence from the credit card companies that we have paid twice. As the Aussies in an earlier review found DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL because any change you make - even using a different credit card - will be punished with a double charge. The plague still exists in London, at 20 Nevern Square."
90,1321,"Feb 27 2007 	Comfortable stay	great 6 day stay. Staff very pleasant. Breakfast was substantial, but not a hot breakfast. Stayed in rm 14 - 5 days ... for some reason, it was always warm (&amp; this was during Feb) - but with window open, the room was fine. Stayed in rm 9 - 1 day. Room much cooler. Both rooms small --- compared to US hotel rooms, but rm 9 seemed a bit larger - maybe because dresser/cabinent was not as large. Closet in Rm 9 was a bit smaller than in rm 14. For 99 pounds, couldn't ask for much more. Bar only was open until 11pm, and on Sundays, it closed even earlier. My british friend would have liked to have tea service in the room, but I didn't mind not having it. Could always get tea from front desk. Free bottles of water in room. Very clean. Both rooms had only a shower, no bath. Park/square across the street was clean, as was the neighborhood."
91,1321,"Feb 20 2007 	Property satisfied our expectations!!!!	Just returned from five nights at this hotel; excellent location -within walking distance of Earl's Court station. The room was, not unexpectedly, somewhat small for a twin but the breakfast buffet made up for it. The staff were gernerally friendly, although they exhibited limited knowledge of the local area! I particularly enjoyed the free tea/coffee and made the most of this service. The rate of 100 Pounds a night would be at the high end of what this hotel is worth. I would definitely return at a somewhat lower rate."
92,1321,"Feb 14 2007 	Little gem of a hotel	Just a short review for this one. My boyfriend and I travelled down on my birthday last year to stay. This is a lovely little gem of a hotel. The room was a double although quite little but I prefer this to them having disrupted the layout of the building too much as it is a lovely old georgian house. The only thing I would have liked would have been a mini bar and also a safe in the room which we did not have. We stayed down here during the heatwave last summer and without air conditionning it was very hot. We did have a fan in the room but this didnt make much difference. The television was quite old fashionned but I know that you don't go away to watch TV! Literally just around the corner from the tube station so excellent links and some lovely pubs nearby. Looking out of the window, it was nice to see the greenery of the square but there was rubbish strewn everywhere by local residents which detracted from the view slightly! I know that is not the fault of the hotel. Breakfast room and selection of food lovely, reception staff very helpful and friendly. Highly recommended."
93,1321,"Feb 13 2007 	Aussies who had a great time	We are also an Australian family who took two teenage daughters for a stay 1st to 7th January, 2007. We found the staff, the facilities and the location to be excellent. Our daughtrers enjoyed their evening Hot Chocolate (complemetary) and we all appreciated the standard of our rooms and bathrooms. I did not think that the furnishings were of cheap quality. I was saddended to hear that the other Ausiie family did not have the best of stays as we cannot speak highly enough of 20 Nevern Square."
94,1321,Feb 9 2007 	very comfortable enjoyable stay	Booked with londonnights.com where it was featured as &quot;Hotel of the Month&quot;. We checked tripadvisor reviews before we booked and the hotel lived up to its reviews. Beautifully clean room with stylish four poster - Lovely shower and very clean bathroom. There was no tea making facility in the room so when we awoke at 5am (we are early risers) we phoned the night porter who brought down a couple of pots of Earl Grey no charge. Nice breakfast room. Smashing small hotel with lots of character. The manager recommended Zizzi's Italian on Earl's Court Road for dinner by the way - real Italian restaurant and proper Italian food - luverly. Thanks to all of the staff.
95,1321,"Jan 30 2007 	Beautiful hotel!	Wow! I booked a four poster bedroom in this hotel as a birthday treat for my boyfriend, as I thought it would be a little more special than just your standard london hotel room. Let me tell you, I wasn't disappointed! The room was stunning - A few stairs take you down a small corridor, where you'll find a small but very nice marble bathroom. Carry on a little and you'll find a huge four poster bed with plenty of room to walk around. Good facilities too - DVD player, television, cd player and freeview. Nice big wardrobe with plenty of hangers (and a nice big full length mirror for the vain types).Ordered breakfast to the room in the morning and it came within 20 mins with plenty of food! Would thoroughly recommend checking this hotel out next time you stay in London!"
96,1321,"Jan 18 2007	The Pasha Suite Amazing Experience	I booked the pasha suite for 3 nights as a gift for my girlfriend. I spoke to sulai on the phone to arrange certain items, champagne, flowers and a few little extra's... I gave him my budget and he was able to sort it all out for me.. I also i mentioned that I did not want my girlfriend to know costs etc so he let me pay him the next morning. The room was amazing, flat screen tv, dvd player, cd player, marble tiled bathroom, power shower just amazing. Also i read in a previous review &quot;fake wooden floors&quot; let me assure you it is real wooden flooring with amazing furnishings, the bed was a four poster and was very comfortable. We had a great view over-looking the garden and the 24hour room service is top-notch. It's great going to a hotel and you don't have to lift a finger. As for breakfast, I had forgotten to put my breakfast list out, I rang down to reception and within 15minutes of my call Sulai once again sorted me out with a full continental breakfast which I arrived on a basket/tray which was fit for a king. Amazing stay and the girlfriend was very pleased."
97,1321,"Jan 15 2007 	Should It Be Twenty NEVER(AGAI)N Square????	We booked four nights at Twenty Nevern Square in December - two rooms, one for us and one for our daughter and schoolfriend travelling with us from Australia. On arrival, and before checking in, we told Sulai at the desk that we had received a call immediately after arriving from Australia which meant that we had to stay for one night less than planned. He told us that we should have given seven days notice (WE HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THIS) and would be charged anyway...we hesitated about checking in but he said he would check with the management and he thought it would be OK.....so, we checked in, had a reasonable stay..........rooms small but clean......the hotel has been made to look 'trendy' but consists of cheap indonesian furniture made to look like a number of very expensive 'boutique hotels' in London. The floors are extremely slippery 'fake' wood so take care...breakfast very poor, ham smelled 'off', bread and pastries etc. One good thing, tea &amp; coffee was available on demand without charge....and arrived promptly.We eventually did stay for an extra night so the only change to our plans was that one room was not used for one night -which we had advised three days previously - We checked out, signed the credit card slip for the total agreed amount, and left......only to receive an e-mail a few days later saying that in spite of telling us at check-out that we would not be charged for a room we didn't use AND giving them at least three days notice, they had decided to charge our credit card anyway..without any authority or agreement from us....this is completely contradictory to any hotel we have ever stayed in. We travel widely and have never experienced anything like this before....we sent various e-mails back but were told in no uncertain terms that they have a very strict cancellation policy (even though it was not set out prior to our arrival). So, our advice is.......if you don't mind terrible customer service, credit card charges being made without your authority and after your departure, poor breakfast, cheap furnishings, go ahead and stay at Twenty Never(agai)n Square but don't say you weren't warned!!!!! P.S. The beds are also cheap and extremely hard!"
98,1321,"Dec 28 2006 	Small but nice	The room was small but comfortable, nicely furnished and clean. The bathroom was luxurious.The continental breakfast was ample and very good.The staff were friendly, and the Kensington location very pretty and pleasant."
99,1321,"Dec 17 2006 	charming London experience	Like many other previous reviews, we found the hotel exceptionally clean, the staff friendly and helpful, and the location ideal for visits throughout London. During the four day stay, we did not observe anyone eating the &quot;full English breakfast&quot; (which was a 9 pound upcharge per person). The &quot;normal&quot; breakfast buffet included in room rate was quite adequate and included the following: chocolate and plain crossiants, wonderful fresh fruit salad, plate of sliced fresh fruit, 4 types of cheeses, 4 types of meat cold cuts, freshly baked rolls, muslix cereal, corn flakes, packaged wheatabix, strawberry yogurt, sour cream, milk, orange juice, teas, coffee, cappacino, jellies, butter. Complimentary afternoon coffee/tea in the &quot;lounge/bird room&quot; was a nice mid-day break. The lounge normally contained bowls of oranges, apples, crackery snack mix and peanuts.A computer with Internet access is available in the lounge for 2 pounds per hour. We found the room to be quiet and maintained at a comfortable temperature. Space in the room was adequate. There are two grocery stores (1 was Marks &amp; Spencer) and a Boots pharmacy just outside the Earl's Court Tube Station on Earl's Court Road. The Marks &amp; Spencer has packaged food suitable for a nice picnic. For those searching for rapid mediocrity, McDonalds, Burger King, and Benjy's can also be found on Earl's Court Road.Direct train service is available from Gatwick Airport to the West Brompton Station (which is a short walk - a flat third of a mile - from the hotel). This direct train to West Brompton actually transported us from airport to hotel as fast as the Gatwick Express would have, without schlepping luggage around Victoria Station (part of the &quot;Express&quot; experience). Train fee was 9 pounds each way, a little less if you also get an Underground Travel card for zones 1 and 2. The return train (West Brompton to Gatwick) may require a train change or two. Detailed schedules are online.We would definitely return to 20 Nevern Square."
100,1321,"Dec 10 2006 	Great Hotel but could be quiter	Booked the hotel on the basis of the previous reviews and was not disappointed. The hotel is only round the corner from the tube station (Earls Court) and in a lovely square which is very quiet. The place its self was beautifully decorated and the staff were very nice. My only grumble was I booked a single room, which was in the basement level. This was fine until about 6 o'clock in the morning, when you could hear the cleaners moving around. This was because the cuboards with all their cleaning products etc were right outside my door. All in all the hotel is worth the money as you get a continental breakfast included, but I would recommend anybody booking the hotel, request they don't go in the basement level unless you have an early start or you are a heavy sleeper."
101,1321,"Dec 8 2006 	Noisy but Nice	A lovely looking hotel in a good spot, not far from Earls Court Tube and a short ish walk to Exhibition Road. Quite a small room but very nicely decorated. Unfortunately the hotel was quite noisy, just with doors banging shut, the lift and the like but did enough to wake us both up. It was very cold during the night.With strict check out times (must be out by 11am or you will be charged) it was disappointing to be kept waiting for over 20 minutes at breakfast and then when we returned to the room to pack we found we were locked out. It must be said the owners have made a great effort to produce a lovely small hotel, it's just because it was a real treat for us to stay in London that these small disappointments seemed quite a big deal at the time."
102,1321,"Dec 7 2006	Number 1 for London	I booked 3 rooms directly with the hotel for a Business conference my colleagues and I were going to for the weekend , I spoke to Sulai, who is just amazing and made all the arrangements for us.On arrival we were greeted by Sulai and the Porter who made us all feel very welcome, we did not have to l;ift a finger our bags were taken care for us and allocated to each of our rooms. The service was impecable throughout our whole stay. The decor of the hotel was lovely, the breakfast was awesome and the free WI-FI was ideal for all of us to get our work done. One of my Girlfirends summed it up the best bit was waking up in the morning and seeing Sulai's face, very handsome. We all look forward to returning to Twenty Nevern."
103,1321,"Dec 6 2006 	An ok experience	The hotel certainly gives a good first impression. The furnishings are just beautiful and the hotel is in a great central location. Our room (No.15) was probably the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in, although the decor was lovely and the room clean. On the down side, the room was incredibly hot to the point of being almost unbearable - depsite the heating being turned down and the window open. I was glad to leave the hotel after one night.The continental breakkfast was substantial and the dining room nice - we did however have to wait 20 minutes in order to get a table. At check out I was charged for something I hadn't ordered and had to point out this mistake to the receptionist.Would I stay here again? Probably not."
104,1321,"Dec 1 2006 	Charming B	We stayed at 20 Nevern Square for 3 nights at the beginning of November. We needed a room that would accommodate the two of us and our 12 yr old son. We were told the 4 poster room would be suitable. It was a lovely room, in the basement. With the rollaway in the room there wasn't really any room for suitcases, etc but the room was nicely decorated. The hotel itself is in a great area, because the tube which is a lovely 5 minute walk through a pretty 'area is on the District and the Piccadilly lines so easy to get to the airport and also into the centre of London. On arrival we asked if the room had tea and coffee making, and were told that we didn't but any coffee or tea, either taken in the sitting room, bar, or our room was complimentary, including cappucino, etc. which was really great. Complimentary delicious fresh fruit was provided in our room and available in the sitting room which our 12 yr old who doesn't usually eat alot of fruit said was the best he'd ever had. The breakfast room was a beautiful atrium room and the breakfast was a very nice continental breaky. Overall, a great experience. The hotel is is a typical Victorian semi and beautifully decorated and maintained."
105,1321,"Nov 28 2006 	A Little Gem!!!	I booked this hotel following the reviews I had read on this site so we were looking forward to our stay. Booked direct with the hotel, good communication and good responses to my emails.Went to London to see a show and xmas shop so only needed one nights stay, a bargain I would say at 55 each inc brekkie.We arrived 3 hours earlier than usual check in allowed but without hesitation our bags were whisked away and we were told to enjoy our shopping and our bags would be waiting for us on our return. We had a lovely welcome, lovely entrance hall, very friendly, helpful and very attentive staff they made us feel really special on our girlie shopping extravaganza! We were offered breakfast in our room the next day at no extra cost which we had - wow loads of food and beautifully presented, highly recommended.We had a twin room in the basement, with a small terrace, rm 2. It was a decent size, tv, radio, cd player, hairdryer, bathrobes with a lovely ensuite, fab shower, comfy beds.My only criticism and its only a very very minor one - our room was quite noisy from about 7-8am from hotel staff, they were obviously getting breakfast ready but after a late night it would have been nice to have a bit of a longer lie in.Next time I think we'd request a room on a higher floor.On checking out at 10am, again the staff were exceptional and offered to store our bags - and there were loads of them - till we shopped some more, they were waiting for us on our return late afternoon. Great service.I can highly recommend this hotel, its a little gem, 2 mins from earls court tube station. Now we have found this one we will without doubt recommend twenty nevern square to all our friends. We hope to return again soon."
106,1321,"Nov 10 2006 	Fab hotel!!!!!!	We spent last weekend at the 20 Nevern Square hotel and loved every minute of it!!!! From the moment we arrived until we collected our bags when returning home, we couldn't fault it!We arrived early on the Friday and were unable to check into our room. This was fair enough as it was only midday. We were able to leave our bags and were advised that they would be placed in our room ready for our return. Much better than having to collect them and struggle up to the room ourselves!!!On our return, we went straight to our room, which was number 16, on the 3rd floor. The decor was very suble and it was nice to see quality fixtures and fittings, instead of the usual mdf units!!!! One downside is that there is very little storage space - 1 small cupboard - and nowhere to put suitcases. Only really a problem if you're staying for a week. The bathroom was fine. It was well lit and had a decent shower. No bathrobes though!!!! I admit that the room is very small, even by London standards, however this is a townhouse hotel and not a purpose built chain hotel! The smallness of the room is completely forgotten as soon as you step out of the french doors on the absolutely fantastic decked terrace!!!! If you were to buy a property with this feature in London, it'd cost you thousands!!!!The bed was comfortable and I had no problems sleeping. However, the room was more than a bit warm and it maybe that it's too warm during the hotter summer months. It was one of the coldest nights of the year so far (-4 in London) and we still had to sleep on top of the covers with the french door slightly open! However, not a major problem and it is worth remembering that this is a boutique hotel in an old building so there are no bulky air conditioning units in the room. This would spoil the style of the room way too much!On our first morning, we ordered breakfast in the room (shame it wasn't warm enough to sit outside). This was at no extra charge like it is in most other hotels, which I thought was a great touch. We thought we'd probably get smaller portions, but no chance!!!!! We got everything that was available in the downstairs breakfast room and probably ended up having a far bigger breakfast than normal!All in all, I cannot fault our stay at 20 Nevern Square. The room was fantastic, the staff were really pleasant and helpful and the location was great - only 2 minutes walk from Earls Court tube station. I can't wait to return to 20 Nevern Square in the summer when I can have my excellent breakfast on the fab terrace of room 16!!!!!!"
107,1321,"Nov 9 2006 	Awesome	After reading some reviews about this hotel, I thought that this was my hotel.I wasn't expecting a lot, just a nice little hotel, but when I arrived there I discovered that it wasn't just a nice little hotel. The staff were very very helpful, the porterage came to help me with my luggage (Porterage in a 4 stars hotel in London? Yes - amazing)Then I saw my room, the number 10 (for single use). The room was small but the furniture was really nice. The bed was awesome and the bathroom clean and useful.The quality of the breakfast was also good, however, there was no much choice. Anyway, for the price I paid for the room, this is an awesome hotel, the best price-quality relation I've ever seen, and this, in London, is very very strange.I would really recommend this hotel to everybody."
108,1321,"Nov 1 2006 	A Pleasant Surprise!	I went to London for a conference and decided to stay a few extra days to see the city. After reading reviews, I booked three nights at Twenty Nevern Square.The staff were friendly and very accomodating and even let me check my bags in the morning before check-in time so that I could catch a West End show. While the room was a little on the small side, it was well furnished and had the most amazing little bathroom I've ever seen for such a small hotel. Everything except for the ceiling was clad in beautiful stone tile.The continental breakfast was delicious and hassle-free. I was able to pop in, eat some yummy croissants and cheese on bread, then walk a few blocks to the tube to be anywhere in London in less than an hour.My only complaint was that it was expensive for an American (about $160 a night when you added everything up, including the horrible exchange rate between the dollar and pound) -- but that's actually cheap for London! The quality for that price, relatively speaking compared to other places in London, was great. I would stay here again."
109,1321,"Oct 21 2006 	Amazing Experience- Twenty PERFECT Square	I decided to visit London for a weekend break and to do some much needed shopping. After looking around Twenty caught our attention for its fantastic reviews, my fiance and I have a new name for the hotel, we call it Twenty (Perfect) Square. I made the booking directly, the response time to my email was about 5 minutes, that alone impressed me. I made a booking with Mr. Sulai, a true gentelman. We arrived at the hotel and I was taken back by the Indonesian look (I love the Eastern look). The Receptionist welcomed us, the hotel staff were polite making us feel welcome. The check-in was informative, I liked the Breakfast in bed on trays part the most. We were escorted to our room by the porter carried our Luggage. We stayed in the Courtyard, the room was lovely, it was soo cosy, wooden floors, lovely silk linen, it was very clean. While I was admiring the decor, my fiance was playing around with the flat screen tv and cd player. To the Breakfast, the fresh fruit and yoghurt did it for me. My fiance Greg opted for the Full English for the 2 days we were there. We had a fantastic weekend.All in all I can speak highly enough of this well run establishment. Everyone was soo sweet and helpful and made our stay truly enjoyable. I am inclined not to believe everything I read but what they say about Twenty PERFECT Square is all true."
110,1321,"Oct 21 2006 	Nearly perfect	If you dont need porridge in the morning, Twenty Nevern Square is an extraordinarily nice and affordable place to stay. I was only going to be in London for one day, so I decided to try a new hotel. If it turned out to be awful, it was only one night. In terms of location, Twenty Nevern Square was a good compromise between central London and Heathrow on the Piccadilly line. The Earl's Court Tube station, which has a lift for luggage, is only about two short blocks away. At 79 GBP from LateRooms (including continental breakfast and VAT), Twenty Nevern Square also was a bargain. Yet, the hotel met or exceeded my expectations in nearly every way. I was informed at check-in that I could have breakfast delivered to my room if I wished and complimentary coffee or tea could be delivered at any time. My single room, which overlooked the Square, was spacious and pleasantly decorated, but not too fussy. With the window closed, it was blessedly quiet for sleeping. Amenities included a bathrobe, a safe, bottled water, and an apple. The staff was completely pleasant and helpful. When I wanted to go out to walk about and get dinner, I realized it had begun to rain and I had no umbrella. I asked the employee in reception if the hotel had an umbrella to borrow. It did not, but without a moments hesitation she simply loaned me her own umbrella. That exceeded my expectations. All I had to do was return the umbrella before she went off duty that evening, which was no problem at all. My only quibble with the hotel: no porridge for breakfast (continental or cooked) and I never did figure out how to operate the remote controls for the TV and its appendages."
111,1321,"Oct 19 2006 	Beware room 23!	Booked this hotel for a 2night theatre break after reading the reviews on this site. We arrived late-ish (after 9pm) and were given a &quot;luxury double&quot; in room 23 on the &quot;lower ground&quot; (i.e. basement) level. After negotiating through the labyrinth down there (improve your signs!) we entered a well decorated - but VERY small - room. Despite this being a &quot;double&quot; room the bed was infact a 3/4 size and not long enough for me to lie on without my feet sticking off the bottom (I'm 6' 2&quot;). The room was so small that there was only an 18&quot; gap at the bottom of the bed to get to the other side of the room (and bathroom) as much of the remaining space had been taken up with a shelf holding the TV and stereo system. There was nowhere to put your suitcases and the storage was 2 small fitted wardrobes.The laminate wood floor was very shiny and slippery in stockinged or bare feet.The bathroom was the major problem. The floor looked dirty (there was some nasty looking brown stains around the base of the toilet pedastal) and the quality of the tiling on the floor was atrocious. Some tiles were also missing from the &quot;shower&quot; area. The shower was a fixed head type over one end of the bath - and that was all, no shower curtain or screen so when the shower was used water inevitably splashed onto the floor and there was no drain for it to clear away in! The quality of finish in the paintwork was also poor, this whole room looked like a DIY bodge job!All in all not what I expect for 100 per night!We naturally complained that the room wasn't up to standard and we were assured that we would be upgraded to a larger room, but only the next day. The hotel was fully booked so we had to put up with it for the first night.Credit where it's due, the staff were good to their word and upgraded us to room 7 the next day - a four poster in here on which I fitted no problem. If I could give 2 separate scores for the 2 rooms then I would."
112,1321,"Oct 18 2006 	Nice location confortable and quiet hotel	We just come back from a 3 nigths stay to Twenty Nevern Square Hotel. We choose the Double luxury accomadations. Our room was clean and not too small for european standard.I was just surprising to read all those exceptionnal and EXCELLENT comments on service at this hotel. The service is good yes.... Yes we meet Sulai one time during our visit. But too munch people work at the service desk of this hotel. I think we saw more then 5 differents people at the reception during our visit. (one at time) We love different culture and different people. But the con of immagrated to welcome us at the hotel is they don't know the neigboorhood and was not able to suggest us good restaurants or other. But everybody did nice effort to help us. (but I think it's a general situation in London - most of the people who work with tourist in restaurants and in hotels are outside from London or outside from England).Another con is the difficulty to close our window in the bathroom... We was not able to completely close and the night was cold during our London stay. The continental breakfeast include is perfect! Good coffee and good hot chocolate!!!Good isolation in old building is a good thing. We sleep well !!! Good matress too!The location is perfect, near of the metro. And the small streets beside is just the idea I got previously of London :-)We enjoy our stay and recommand this hotel to everybody who visit London."
113,1321,"Oct 11 2006 	Brilliant!	My wife and I stayed at 20 Nevern Square for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon.The hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff is extremely friendly. The beds could be a bit more comfortable, as they are quite soft - but I do like a hard matress. The continental breakfast is great - ask for a free upgrade to the Full English Breakfast and the hotel will likely oblige. The surrounding area is very quiet and safe and is only a short 3 minute walk from the Earl's Court station.We will definitely be returning to 20 Nevern Square!"
114,1321,"Sep 20 2006 	Perfect location and lovely hotel	We were pinching pennies at the end of our trip, so we opted to stay out of central London, which was a great decision. We liked the Earls Court area and we liked the hotel. The room was incredibly small, but since we were only there to sleep, I really cannot complain. They'd thoughtfully provided a fan for us, which made the weekend of 75 degrees + temperatures bearable. Breakfasts were very nice and the staff was very friendly. As we were checking out they desk clerk asked if we wished to stow our luggage until our flight, which gave us the opportunity to do one more museum before we left. All in all, a lovely experience."
115,1321,"Sep 18 2006	Lovely lovely lovely!	It's the best hotel I've ever stay in. Little, cosy and sweet, it's situated in a quiet greeny area 5 min walk from subway station. Our twin room was small, but comfortable enough not to trip on each other. Room service was exellent, stuff was friendly, helpfull but unostentatious - i like it. Were is my suitcase? I want come back to my London weekend in Twenty Nevern Square!"
116,1321,"Sep 11 2006 	will not stay anywhere else in London	Stayed here twice during my last trip- in mid August and early Sept. Like almost everyone else I have nothing but praise for this excellent small establishment. Can't believe I even considered staying elsewhere when planning this trip. The rooms are exquisite; the staff genuine, accessible and attentive to a fault while remaining discreet; the included breakfast enough to recomend this hotel alone! Stayed in a luxury double (rm 15) on the 2nd floor and had a free upgrade to a 4 poster room (rm22) on the lower gd the 2nd stay. Both were beautifully furnished, well maintained, included a safe and had adequate space. The photos on their website are a true and accurate reflection of what you will find when you arrive. The small touches like fresh bottled water and fresh fruit replaced each day are just a small example of the attention to detail that makes this hotel the perfect London base. Little tip- room service breakfast is free and delivered within 10 minutes of phoning up and includes everything from the buffet so if jetlag is making getting going in the morning hard why not spend a little longer in their comfortable bed? The fact that the hotel is located so handily for the tube to central london and heathrow, close to supermarkets and reasonable restaurants, while being in a quiet residential street is icing on a cake that doesn't need it. For the price, or even a whole lot more, I don't think you can do better and will be recommending twenty nevern square to all my friends - in fact already have. Returning for our 2nd stay was like returning home and twenty nevern was hands down the best hotel of our trip. And Sulai needs nominating for best front of house staff in London- that man is a gem."
117,1321,"Sep 5 2006 	Highly reccommended! Will definitely return!	I had not visited London in 10 years and was quite anxious to find just the right place for a return visit, where I was bringing my Mom for a 60th birthday gift. Remembering that London hotels can be no better than a closet with a bed and after reading the many mixed to horrifying reviews on websites like Tripadvisor, I was worried to say the least. Can a clean, stylish hotel that isn't a shoebox not cost an arm and a leg?After extensive research and worry, I booked an eight night stay at Twenty Nevern Square. I was relieved and very pleased to find that the hotel's website and their Tripadvisor reviews were spot on. I loved this hotel and will definitely return for another stay. The luxury twin room we had on the 1st floor was exactly as pictured on the website. Smallish but cozy for two, the room was beautifully decorated. There was a fan, in room safe and high ceilings with a large window overlooking the back garden cafe area. The bathroom was very small and there was a cracked floor tile, but the lovely marble, decorative accents, toiletries and bathrobe were great. There was also free bottled water. I echo the same complaint about the timer on the bathroom light - without fail, while I went to wash my hair, the light would always go off and I would have to open and close the door to get it going again. Otherwise, it was lovely.Service was SO wonderful. Everyone we encountered at the hotel were friendly, helpful and kind to us. Our stay was enjoyable through their hard work. There are free apples and tangerines. The free portion of the daily breakfast was lovely. Use of the Internet in the lounge costs 2 GBP an hour.Centrally located, 2 blocks from the Tube (where there's the post office, supermarkets, restaurants, etc.). Quiet street with no noise. Great, great, great place. I'm definitely staying here again the next time I visit!"
118,1321,"Aug 12 2006	Quaint and Charming	This hotel is a little gem. It is well located in Earl's Court, one street back from the main road and situated on a quiet square in a very traditional setting. The rooms are beautifully decorated and comfortable. The breakfasts were excellent and the staff were very helpful and accommodating. Highly recommend Twenty Nevern Square."
119,1321,"Aug 7 2006 	More good than bad	This hotel was in a decent location with friendly good service, Great Breakfast and cafe staff . The room #10 that we stayed was nicley decorated, and very clean. A little on the small side. It is not air condtioned, and most the time it is not needed, but the few nights in August we were there I would have slept better. The other small complaint is the automatic light in the bathroom was on the annoying side. Taking a shower, or sitting on the toliet without enough movement shuts off the light after 1 minute. You have to wave your arms in the air every minute or your in the dark.All in all it was a desent hotel, but always room for improvment.1. Do something with that batroom light2. Be more informed on the local restuarants and events3. A fan that pulls the air from outside into the rooms for those hot days. My favorite restuarant in Earls court....Masala zone Indian restaurant on Earl court rd. ...Best Indian and Thai food I have eaten."
120,1321,"Jun 29 2006	our new fav place in London	We had to find a place to stay in a hurry. We went to Trip Advisor and found 20 Nevern Square. By reading what others had written and using our previous experience in the UK &amp; Europe we found a VERY NICE place at 20 Nevern Square. Two factors make a good hotel  the staff and the physical surroundings (especially the bathroom). The staff at 20 Nevern Square were sincerely attentive to our needs and paid attention to detail that would make an Army Sergeant Major proud. One day we were constantly in and out of our room until about 4:00 p.m. None the less when we finally went out for the day and came back, the room had been thoroughly made up and cleaned. I have been in 4 star places where that wouldnt have happened that late in the day without asking for it. The room was small by US standards, but London is not in the US. It was spacious enough for us to be comfortable and the furnishing and dcor were very pleasant. The bathroom was spanking new and sparkling, but again not as big as most US bathrooms. So if you want big open spaces, pay a lot more or stay in the US. If quiet, clean, comfortable and reasonably priced is for you then stay at 20 Nevern Square.Three more plusses  short walk to Tube Station; short walk to many reasonable / family restaurants and quiet neighborhood."
121,1321,"Jun 15 2006	Top marks for 20	If, like us, you arrive by tube, don't be put off by Earls Court Road. Although the hotel is only a few minutes away, it feels like it is in another world. The area is lovely and peaceful. The hotel is thoughtfully decorated, no bland business decor here. We were in room six which has quite a steep staircase between the entrance door and the bedroom itself. Our only quibble was that the doors tended to slam and the person above us seemed to have a particularly heavy tread so there was no sleeping in in the mornings. Having said that, the breakfast was definitely worth getting up for. The fresh fruit salad was just that (no tinned fruit here) and the pastries were delicious. I was a little surprised by the note informing us that check out was at 11am sharp and that every hour after that would incur a 20 fine. The staff were, however, happy to store our luggage until our late evening departure. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it."
122,1321,"May 31 2006	An oasis in the city	We stayed at Twenty Nevern Square this May for 3 nights and we were not dissapointed. The hotel is not too expensive (for London!) and we have only positive comments. It is located in a great neighbourhood and if you are travelling by tube, it is a 3 minute walk from Earls Court station. We had a room facing the park which was small but nicely decorated and spotless. The staff was professional and helpful. The breakfast which is included in the cost of the room had a good selection and the coffee was great. We had a late flight leaving and they readily agreed to let us leave our luggage there for the day after our checkout. In a nutshell, we highly recommend it and would return. Great value for the cost."
123,1321,"May 25 2006	An absolute gem	My husband and I booked this hotel for a one night break in London after seing a review in the Daily Telegraph and can only say that the review did not do it justice. The service was excellent from our very first email and telephone contact with Sulai. He made us so welcome on arrival. Yes the room is a little on the small side but so what. It was beautifully decorated and appointed, spotlessly clean and had an extremely comfortable bed. The bathroom was on the small side but again spotlessly clean. Tea and coffee were available at all hours and breakfast the next day was easily the best continental breakfast we have ever had. We loved all the fresh fruit. All the staff were charming and helpful. We shall definitely stay there again. The location is superb - only minutes from the Tube."
124,1321,"May 21 2006 	A little gem.	The hotel is ideally situated, 3 minutes walk away from Earls Court tube station. As soon as I walked in, I knew it was a good choice. Clean and welcoming, with a small nicely furnished sitting room and beautiful breakfast conservatory. I had room number 12, a twin, which was spotlessly clean but was a little small. It was fine for me as I was travelling overnight on business alone, with little luggage; but two people and suitcases would have been cramped.The room had a TV with digital channels and a CD player; built in wardrobes and a safe. The bathroom was fully tiled, modern style handbasin, spotlesssly clean with robe and great toiletries. The shower, in it's own cubicle (no bath). The bathroom was again rather small, but fine for me. I agree with the automatic light comments, as when in the shower, the sensor does not pick your movement up and the light turns off, so you have to open the door and wave. Ha!The staff are extremely friendly and make you feel welcome, the breakfast was delicous and I would definately stop there again. It really is a little gem, ideally located, offering great value for money and a break from traditional hotel chains that my company always try and make us use."
125,1321,"May 19 2006	Location! Location! Location!	I can NOT say enough about this beautiful hotel!!! It was so lovely it was hard to tear myself away and explore London and all it had to offer. This was my first trip abroad and I was not sure what to expect....the hotel staff did NOT let me down. Located in Earl's Court, in a quite residential neighborhood, you are literally right around the corner from the tube station. The breakfast was a lovely continental spread with cheeses fruit pastries etc hardy enough to fill you up for a days worth of sight seeing. I booked my room through DiscountCityHotels(-) and got a good rate of 99.00 GBP (187.00 US) per night for a four poster room which more than met my expectations. If I had anything negetive to say it would be that at the time of my stay (March 16-19, 2006) the web page was not clear about the on site parking. It stated parking was on a first come first serve basis, but in fact you need to book the parking facility when you book your accommedations. The staff quickly addressed the problem for us securing parking at another hotel, and for the inconvienence upgraded us to the BEST room in the hotel. I am hoping to return to London again later this year, and I will not hesitate to book my room at Twenty Nevren Square."
126,1321,"May 18 2006	Wonderful place with excellent service	We stayed here for four nights and not only was our room fantastic (Pasha Suite) with a lovely balcony overlooking a park, the bathroom was spacious and we had a separate tub and shower. The regular rooms on the 2nd floor also looked nice as I peeked in once when housekeeping was inside. But the best thing about this place is the service. The staff was excellent and made you feel as though they care that you were happy with everything about your stay. For a small townhouse hotel I was surprised by this level of service. We arrived at 9 am and though our room wasn't ready (but occupied as we knew it would be) they offered us breakfast. We were full from the plane meal but did have beverages while they stored our luggage and sent us on the way to the tube which is less than five minutes away. The only minor complaint I had was the bathroom light is on a sensor so you can't turn it off at will....this is a problem in the middle of the night when the light is beaming into the room and it seems that each bathroom light was the same. For everything else it couldn't be beat for value. The breakfast (included in rate) was very good and there were nice robes in the room and they would serve you coffee and tea throughout the day without charge. I highly recommend this place if you like to stay in a peaceful neighborhood with no horns waking you un in the middle of the night. Special thanks to Sulai at the front desk who was probably the most thoughtful person we encountered on our trip. Twenty Nevern Square is like a precious jewel in a sea of mediocrity."
127,1321,"Apr 27 2006 	My advice: Stay Clear!	I had a terrible experince with Twenty Nevern and was reminded of it when friends asked if they should stay here. It was in the weeks after 9/11 and when I arrived they had double booked my room (something called the Pasha Suite). The alternate room was dingy and dark (and frankly smelled off to me). I decided to move hotels and was twice assured no charge would be made to my credit card (the front desk &quot;manager&quot; even telephoned his manager to confirm!) - when I got my credit card statement, they, of course, had charged my card. I disputed payment and had a 6 month e-mail trail of changing stories and finally outright lies. I ended up givng up and paying. I found Earl's court to be an okay but very remote area. You can do better in London which is a great town."
128,1321,"Apr 18 2006	Great Quiet Townhouse Hotel	We stayed 3 nights midweek at the start of April 2006 and were pleasently surprised by the hotel. On arrival we were allocated a brand new room (the hotel seems to be expanding into neighbouring random spaces), which was in the basement under the breakfast room. The room (no. 3) was quite swish with a new style four poster bed, though we had only paid 90 per night for a 'delux double' directly through the hotel. It had a 3/4 length bath and seperate powerful shower in the bathroom. We were pretty pleased. The room was a little dark for our liking, but was very private.The next morning we heard a fair amount of noise from the neighbouring kitchen and could hear footsteps from the breakfast room above (though we are light sleepers), but the staff on reception were very helpful and found us an alternative room without question. We ended up being upgraded to a lovely four poster room opposite reception (Room 4) with no extra charge, which was fairly peaceful. We were impressed.The staff at reception were helpful during our stay and the continental breakfast included in the room rate was good (though if you want a large selection of pastry/bread etc, you might be disappointed) and satisfied us.To summarise - a very good deal for a nice double room in a quiet square in central London. We would consider staying again next time we visit London."
129,1321,"Mar 21 2006	Mixed experience	We stayed at 20 Nevern Square for 2 nights last weekend. We had a good rate of 90 per room per night thru Late Rooms.In my booking I requested a space in the advertised Hotel Car Park (20 per night) as we could not take the train due to industrial action and the lack of availability from Cornwall. I did receive a call to say they would sort this out.On arrival I was told the carpark was full and I could park at Homebase 5 - 10 mins walk away. Beatrice (the very helpful receptionist) got a porter to help me find somewhere close by - but to no avail. I was not happy with this and eventually the manager booked me in to the hotel K &amp; K George to park which fortunately we did.The bedroom (room 10 on 2nd floor) was probably the smallest room I have ever stayed in. However it was immaculately clean and beautifully decorated. The marble bathroom was also immaculate with bath/shower and toilet.Breakfast was a superb continental buffet with everything cooked fresh and very tasty. There is a full english available for 9, which some people had and again looked great, but we did not need it as the continental buffet was great.We were 2 mins from Earls Court Road (try Benito's Italian Diner - awesome tasty food and amazingly friendly service at incredibly cheap prices) and 12 minutes walk from London Olympia - so very convenient.On balance, I think we would stay there again - provided we could have a different room and the same parking arrangements."
130,1321,"Feb 13 2006	Fabulous!	Stayed here for two nights. Nevern Square is within 3 minutes of Earls Court tube, but very genteel and quiet. Check-in was very straightforward, having booked direct by phone at the rate of 109 for a four poster room. The staff were welcoming and helpful. Every dealing with them was pleasant.Decor throughout is beautiful. Our room was luxurious, warm, very clean, and well equipped. Despite its location directly opposite reception it wasn't noisy. Gilchrist &amp; Soames toiletries, bathrobe, thick towels, plus the complimentary apple! Hot drinks delivered to the room whenever requested were a lovely touch. We managed fine for space, and it was good to have a CD player and digital TV.Meant to have the full english breakfast, but the continental was so enticing we didn't need to. Fresh fruit salad, and the pain au chocolate are unmissable.Nice looking bistro cafe, and a small lounge with fire burning. A very enjoyable break and will definitely go back."
131,1321,"Feb 10 2006	Very pleased with our stay	Our stay at Nevern Square was a comfortable one. Our room was small, but pleasant with a stairway leading up to the room. The bathroom was in perfect condition and looked brand new.I particularly liked the decor of the whole place, all dark wood and warm colours. Breakfast was a treat - croissants, fruit and yoghurt were such a nice change from the usual bacon-beans-and-eggs breakfast youre usually served in the UK. Staff members were friendly although a bit impersonal, but I guess thats London. Yes, rooms were small but again, thats typical of London hotels and Ive seen much worse.Nevern Square is on a quiet street facing a small square so no traffice noise here. Theres a five minute walk to Earls Court tube station. Would definetely stay here again."
132,1321,"Feb 1 2006	Delightful hotel great value and location	We loved our stay; our twin room was smallish, but cozy, extremely clean and functional. The breakfast is good and the staff was absolutely the best - helpful in every way. The location is less than a block to the subway line to Heathrow and anything in London. My only warning would be to avoid a room in the basement - you can hear every footstep in the lobby up above. When requested, we were immediately moved."
133,1321,"Dec 17 2005	Style and good price	This is an excellent hotel for the style and price on offer. Not far from the train station, the staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are small but elegant and clean, and if you are looking for great value this is the place. Can get a little hot in the summer months, however."
134,1321,"Nov 21 2005	Great value	Booked two nights at twenty nevern square after good reviews on trip advisor. Got a very good rate through 'bookings' and wasn't disappointed. Reserved a four poster room as reviews said these were larger. Room was fairly compact but more than adequate and there were nice touches like bottles of water in the bathroom and a large fresh apple each day. The staff at the hotel couldn't do enough to help and were polite, friendly and attentive. The inclusive breakfast was very good and freshly brewed coffee was available free of charge throughout the day. A cosy, small bar area with comfortable sofas and a fire was welcoming and drinks were fairly priced. Within walking distance of High Street Kensington and a two minute walk to Earl's Court tube, the location is excellent. No complaints whatsoever for the price paid and if we found a good price on the internet again for twenty nevern square, we would have no hesitation in snapping it up. Well recommended!"
135,1321,"Sep 18 2005	Delightful clean exceptionally well run	Only the room size stopped me from giving this very well run and very clean hotel an 'excellent'. We stayed in room 15 (overlooking the square) which clearly was formerly one large room but now divided. Consequently, the double size bed (next size down from a queen size) was alongside the wall - annoying when needing to get out of bed during the night. Also, so as to have a reading light, we moved the wall table &amp; lamp to behind the bedhead. The bathroom was small but v clean &amp; well lit. Had we arrived earlier or certainly were we to stay longer, we would have requested a larger room.It looked like the hotel has had a recent spruce up.Decor is tasteful: plain silk, well lined floor length curtains and generally of Far Eastern design. The windows open - hurrah ! There is a comfortable lounge area with fire (was lit when we went down for breakfast), delightful conservatory dining area + bar. Very good breakfast, ditto service. Best fruit cocktail ever. 2 very nice touches, free freshly made and delicious coffee &amp; tea served in the lounge &amp; 2 bottles of water for us in the bathroom. Thoughtful, high quality service all round."
136,1321,"Aug 11 2005	Good service but small rooms	I styed here for 3 nights, I followed prevous reveiwers and asked for a larger room, however the double I was allocated was tiny with barely enough room to walk around the bed, it wasn't till my wife joined me we were moved into room 4, a large four poster room. The weather when I stayed was warm and with no climate controls in the room it was difficult to get a flow of air through the room, even with the windows open.The staff were very helpful and curtious and the continental breakfasts were both substantial and fresh.I would stay again but insist on a larger room."
137,1321,Mar 22 2005	ok	The hotel staff are friendly and the breakfast is good. I found that the rooms were small although i guess thats what you should expect from a townhouse. Also the bathrooms were very small. Overall it was fine but I expected more for the amount we paid. As have stayed at much nicer hotels for less.

1,1334,"basic hotel .not interested in clients once payment is recieved	stayed here for a long weekend . found one member of staff rude very and manager very uninterested in our complaint . this bar man was in our opinion very anti irish .we were refused the 10% discount that was supposed to be there for residents.closed the bar early and even refused to serve us last night there .other staff members offered to serve us ,but for a group of women on a weekend away it totally ruined it .."
2,1334,Nov 19 2009 	Good location reasonable rates	Was in the hotel for 5 nights o a business trip. Great location. Single room on first night (Room 305) had faulty hot water mixer in shower. Made a complaint and front desk manager promptly arranged to change to a better and quieter room on on higher floor away from street view. Room was rather spartan but was clean. The toilet and bath are new and bathroom brightly lit and clean.
3,1334,"Nov 19 2009 	Horrible	Disgusting rooms, filthy corridors with stained carpets &amp; even the lift is dirty"
4,1334,"Nov 13 2009 	Location Location Location	Stayed at the Waverley House from 10/28/2009 to 11/1/2009. Had a twin room with a friend.in the back with no view but no street noinse and the construction could not be hears with the windo closed The beds were comfortable , although the pillows were hard; the bathroom clean ;and the air conditioner worked well in an unusally warm , Mid 60's fall weekend.There are two tube stations within 5 to 10 minutes walk of the hotel and it is only about 20 to 25 minutes slow walk to Covent Garden. This was our first trip[ to London and a great location . The desk staff was very helpful and they kept our luggage unitl 2:30 although we checked out by 10. The breakfast was quite good if you took advantage of their fresh fried or poached eggs and fresh toast. The scrambled eggs and cold toast in the buffet were disgustingThe room was small for two twin beds but there was plenty of room to store the luggage out of the way . The biggest problem was that the TV stand was so large that you could not easily walk arond the end of the bed to get to the door. Changing that one piece of furniture would have made having two beds in the room much more manageable . .The safe was located so close to the floor in the closet that I found it unusable, small print too hard to read The carpet was worn near the bathroom and they should invest in a new toilet seat but there was new tile on the bahtroom floor and walls and a comfy full size soaking tub."
5,1334,"Nov 10 2009 	Pretty horrendous	This hotel is pretty poor. It's dank, dingy, dirty, noisy and the lights in my room didn't all work. The breakfast was surprisingly good, and the staff were friendly, but that interior of the rooms, the elevator and the corridors was embarrasing."
6,1334,"Oct 19 2009 	A wee Gem	We stayed here for our anniversary. We wanted to be close to Covent Garden. The hotel was close to the tube station, and only on the Piccidilly Line, but the hotel itself held on to the characteristics which made it more homely. Check was quick and smooth. The room was adequate but the bathroom needed a lick of pain and new toilet seat. Breakfast was a hot buffet which continental choices as well as cereals etc. The only complaint was the maid service coming at 3pm to service the room when I wanted to rest before the evening show. Other guests could be quite noisy when returning during the night (about 3am). But otherwise this wee hotel was a gem of a find and we felt quite safe in the area. Plenty places to eat and a tesco metro opposite the Tube Station for Krispy Kreme donuts."
7,1334,"Oct 3 2009 	Great Hotel - Good Location Near Tube	Hi, just back from London. Stayed iN Waverly house hotel. Have to stay location is perfect sandwiched between Russell Square and Hoburn Tube stops. Just one stop to convent garden. Ye, hotel looks a little rundown but the staff are nice, the breakfast is wonderful and the location is excellent. Step outside the door of the hotel and down a lane are some nice restaurants and pub. Room is fine and it is air conditioned."
8,1334,"Sep 14 2009 	Value for money in a great location	Was impressed with this hotel and at the price I paid it was good value for money.Location is great, only a ten to fifteen minute walk to Oxford Street and Covent Garden.Staff were very helpful and friendly, esp the concierge, breakfast was very good, and is available until 11am, which is a nice touch for leisure travellers, the restaurant was very light and airy. The hotel was clean, well lit, and smelled nice !!. The bed was very comfy and noise levels from outside were acceptable in the room (5th Floor).I did have a few gripes, the air con packed up in the room, but that could of happened at any hotel, the bathroom was ridiculously hot (even b4 the air con packed up), although it was clean and the towels were fresh.I'd def stay here again and would recommend it due to location and value for money."
9,1334,"Sep 2 2009	My daughter and I loved it ! And we are picky.	What a wonderful surprise this hotel was! Yes, it is small, but like a little jewel box. From the fresh flowers in the lobby and gleaming brass and glass elevator, to the small but very cozy, flower-and-striped-wallpaper bedroom and gleaming bath with a wonderful shower, to the plentiful and wide-ranging offerings in the comfortable and attractive breakfast room, we were quite satisfied. And we've stayed at 'em all, in numerous countries. I've just searched it out on the internet for another stay when we are in London. Also liked the Old Amalfi restaurant across the street. Staff was very nice and helpful, as well."
10,1334,"Aug 15 2009 	Clean and comfortable but rooms could do with a bit of a makeover!	I have just returned from a stay at the Waverley House Hotel. The hotel was situated close to 2 tube stations (about a 5 minute walk) and has a bus stop outside. The staff at the hotel were all very polite and welcoming. The room was clean, although a little dated. There was a kettle with tea, coffee and hot chocolate, biscuits and bottled water. The en-suite, although clean, was in desperate need of renovation. The toilet was very difficult to flush and needed replacing along with the shower. The room was fitted with a remote controlled air conditioning unit which was was wonderful!The breakfast was a definate highlight of the stay. The bacon was delicious and, as well as the hot buffet, freshly cooked poached and fried eggs were available upon request. The staff in the breakfast room were very friendly and helpful."
11,1334,"Aug 2 2009 	Pleased	Capital city centre hotels can be poor, dirty and expensive. This hotel is more than adequate for a stay of a few days.The breakfast was excellent - help-yourself with a wide choice and no restiction on the quantity. They used back bacon and the jam and marmalade was Tiptree, none of these are the cheapest.My room on the sixth floor was clean and quite spacious. Although it had one single bed, it would have easily taken a double or even two singles. It was at the rear of the premises and very quiet, although a room fronting Southampton Row could be noisy I think owing to the traffic. A kettle was in the room plus a selection of tea, coffee and hot chocolate sachets, plus a pack of two biscuits and a bottle of water. The TV was a 19 inch one.The ensuite bathroom, while a little cramped, was modern and spotlessly clean, Shampoo, shower gel, soap, a shower cap and a shoe polishing kit were provided. A hair dryers was in the dressing table drawer.The hotel is non-smoking with detectors in the rooms. A notice warned that anyone smoking will be charged for a deep clean of the room and this would be a hefty sum.Staff were firendly and helpful. Leaving my case until 4pm at reception on the day I checked out was no problem.I would happly stay here again.A word of warning when booking online: prices for the same hotel can vary and not because of a superior room. Shop around and also check the cancellation terms. Some sites alloe free cancellation within two or three days of the stay beginning, while others levy a charge."
12,1334,"Jul 21 2009 	nice hotel with friendly staff	ideal location near underground tube station which is 5 minute walk, friendly &amp; helpful staff, they make you feel welcome, good heating in winter, nearby restaurents but they are expensive, nearby super store for 24 hour shopping, breakfast is really nice, i like this place"
13,1334,"Jun 20 2009 	Not the best...	Stayed here for one night after organizing a trip with girlfriends to London.Unfortunately it was a bit of a disaster, the rooms were clean but we had no electricity from 7pm and no water in the morning, no plates for breakfast!Great location and we didnt pay alot....thank god!!!"
14,1334,"May 16 2009 	Great Location	Very comfortable stay , bedroom not huge but adequate. Evening meal and breakfast were very nice. Staff very helpful and courteous"
15,1334,"May 12 2009 	NOT IMPRESSED !!!!!!!	I stayed in this hotel this past weekend with 2 friends. In advance I had telephoned many hotels requesting a room with 3 single beds as my 2 companions will not share, and had chosen the Waverly having been told they would provide this. On arrival however we discovered the hotel does not have a 3 bed room!!! and as I did not have the name of the person I had spoken to they just did not want to know and were most unhelpful. We had to stay the 1st night and moved next morning. The room with a double and single bed was quite ok, comfy and spacious though the bathroom was antiquated. At 7.30, 8.30 and 10.15 next morning we were awoken by housekeeping knocking very loudly on every door on the corridor shouting &quot;just checking&quot;, when asked by a couple of residents at 8.30 what she was checking she just walked off, when asked again at 10.15 she said she wanted to know what time we were checking out. The breakfast itself was fine but the staff were the rudest I have come across in many many years of travelling. They obviously hated their jobs and did not want to be there, we got the feeling that the managment have quite alot of work to do in regard to working relations with their staff. We were very glad to move practically next door to a hotel where we had an all round much greater experience. Will definately not return to the Waverly."
16,1334,"Mar 12 2009 	London Sightseeing	We stayed at WH for 26 days in September 2007. Our room ,#206,was a corner one with a door onto a tiny balcony overlooking Southampton Row. With newly installed air-conditioning and double-glazed windows we were able to control both temperature and noise from the thoroughfare below. Room decor was a bit dated but everything was nice and clean. Beds and furniture were comfortable and we enjoyed our near month-long stay at living at WH. Meal-wise,we mostly had breakfasts at the hotel ,I can recommend the lamb shanks on Sunday nights though!, Dining room staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. This is a great wee hotel to base yourself at whilst &quot;doing&quot; London thorougly.We will return. Tip,don't eat at Cagneys!(round the corner)"
17,1334,"Feb 3 2009 	location the room and the staff quite perfect.	Tiny room as you might expect it in London, but really clean and in a truly genuine British style. The bed are more comfortable than in many other 3 stars hotels. The bathroom was perfectly clean and well equipped (Large bath). Following previous reviews comments, I was startled by seeing a air conditioner in the room with a remote control. I booked a double room for my girlfriend and I the last weekend of January so it was useless at the time but for summer, it would be useful indeed. The breakfast is a large english buffet with bacons, scrambled eggs, sausages, croissant and various other good things to eat. But the icing on the cake was the helpful staff, prone to anticipate every wishes. So if you are seeking for a cosy atmosphere well located hotel, this one is yours."
18,1334,"Jan 30 2009 	Very disappointed	When we checked in we were told there would be no hot water after 8.30 the following morning. There was none when we tried at 07.45. The room, 315 was badly arranged, we coul dn't get ourselves and the cases in together without passing them through. The mattress was lumpy with springs.Breakfast was fine, but the staff were conspicuous by their absence. I've written to complain but after a week no response."
19,1334,"Jan 25 2009 	Very Satisfied	Stayed with my wife 3 nights in mid Jan 2009. We were very satisfied overall. Room was a nice size, well stocked and clean. Everything in room worked as it should, with good tea making facilities. Staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast excellent selection and well managed with no delay. Very central location for tube etc. (traffic noise can be loud if window opened).I would recommend this hotel and I would stay again."
20,1334,"Jan 14 2009 	Comfortable	Had to get a last minute room - read varied reviews on Waverley but only room left - very pleased, felt comfortable as single female. Room on top floor, very clean. Fresh bathroom. Nice check in staff and really nice girls in restaurant for breakfast with good choice hot and cold food. Will stay again."
21,1334,"Dec 22 2008 	pleasantly surprised..	I stayed here last weekend with a couple of friends. We had a single and twin room and were happy with both. My single was a decent size with a new looking bathroom. The decor is plain but inoffensive and everything worked.. nice quality goodies in the bathroom and on the tea tray too.The staff were delightful, the guys on reception were cheerful and funny and the bar staff were totally on the ball when we stopped in for a nightcap or two. Breakfast was one of the best I've had in a hotel of this class; full english buffet all well cooked and hot. We were there for the theatre, and the hotel is excellently located for the West End. We also went to the British Museum whilst we were there, which is just round the corner. The hotel is also handy for a range of local shops, cafes and banks."
22,1334,"Oct 7 2008 	Don't be fooled by the photos on the web site	I accept that this is a 3 star hotel in central London so the rooms were adequate for London - small but liveable. The decor is a little tired and in need of sprucing up. The hotel is well positioned near Russell Square Tube and Holborn Tube and there are some great restaurants near to the hotel - I recommend the Hason Raja Indian Restaurant which was a few mins walk from the hotel. My main gripe was the atitude of the reception staff at the hotel. Unhelpful and rude. I think their view of Customer Service left a lot to be desired. I think they took pleasure is saying 'no'.I had breakfast in the restaurant and the staff in the restaurant were very helpful. The full English breakfast was lovely but the evening meal fell short of acceptable standards for the price one was paying - ok for a fiver but not when you are paying 12 quid. Evening meal - I had the curry - was overcooked, overseasoned and overpriced. Eat out, the food is much nicer."
23,1334,Sep 22 2008 	Very good location	Stayed her for a short Theatre break. A short walk from underground so easy to get around. Nice large rooms and a very good breakfast. Pleasant staff and complimentary newspaper with coffe making facilities in bedroom. Very good value for money.Will definately stay again.
24,1334,"Aug 27 2008 	Good location but noisy	Booked a one-night stay (business trip); got a reasonable rate for this part of London - 49 pounds for a single, inc a good, full English breakfast. Hotel is close to Tube stations, and in a nice touristy area - but be warned: the street is busy till the early hours, and the bedroom rumbles to the sound of lorries and the occasional shout/music from revellers below. Room is small, furnishings a bit dated, but the bathroom was clean and functional. Overall, not bad for the price I paid ... not sure I'd pay much more though."
25,1334,"Jun 26 2008 	Very good location but not so clean...	I stayed in Waverley House for 2 nights in May. The location was ideal for a business trip, as the train stations are very close, and in the evening, the London museums and cafes and bookshops are open till late.. easy to find. British Museum is just around the corner! I would not, however, recommend this hotel due to the rooms and overall cleanliness not meeting the expectations. I had 2 different bookings, and the first night\s room was really dusty and dirty (I didnt mind the small size of the room). The bed matress was also very crumpy. The second night\s room was slightly cleaner. An example of the overall cleanliness is the ELEVATOR which the hotel staff could CLEAN at least for a better first impression. Next time, I might stay in the area, but not in this hotel."
26,1334,"Apr 10 2008 	Lovely time  staff very helpful smashing breakfast	We booked this hotel for conveience of covent garden and wasnt disapointed. Easy walking distance to tube and the main attractions in covent garden. We booked a triple bedroom and was pleasantly surprised at how spacious it was also clean and comfortable a bit on the warm side but better than being cold. The staff were all very helpful and friendly and the same for the staff in Deans brassier were we had our evening meal before going to see our show, the meal we had took a while to come but when it did we it was very nice and good value for money. The breakfast was outstanding everything you could wish and catered for all tastes. I would not hesitate in booking this hotel again."
27,1334,"Mar 8 2008 	Not so bad	Stayed at the Waverley last week and like the previous reviewer was apprehensive after the bad reviews. All the staff were polite, helpful and pleasant. I agree the hotel is old fashioned and needs updating however it was clean and the room I had at the back on the 5th floor was quiet. Very near British Museum and walking distance to Shaftesbury Avenue. If you have already booked make sure you ask for a room at the back."
28,1334,"Feb 5 2008 	We were a little apprehensive.	My daughter and I have just returned from a four day sightseeing break in London. After reading some of the reviews on Trip advisor, we were a little apprehensive about staying at this hotel. We needn't have worried. Everyone was friendly and polite (perhaps some of your reviewers should learn to smile and be polite to people themselves, its works wonders,)Our twin room was very clean, beds immaculately made up every day. When our TV didn't work, they immediately changed it. Self service buffet breakfast, plenty of choice to suit everyone. Bar staff friendly. The location was ideal. Tube around the corner, however, the hotel is within walking distance.of most attractions, theatres and big shops. Best of all was that while Falmouth in Cornwall (where we live ) was being lashed by gales and rain, we had beautiful weather with no rain at all."
29,1334,"Dec 25 2007	Worst shower in hotel history	My business contact in London made this reservation so I was stuck, although I read the reviews here. Except for the decent location, the hotel was every bit as bad as everyone here says: unhelpful and apathetic staff, bad breakfast, incredibly small room (like a college dorm room), VERY loud doors slamming throughout the hallway, easily heard conversations in adjacent rooms, cold bathroom (knob for heater broke off in my hand), and very possibly the worst hotel shower I've ever encountered, even after I removed the water saver from the shower head. Not only was it barely pressured, but absolutely impossible to regulate the temperature. This hotel is a stinker!"
30,1334,"Nov 30 2007 	Dreadful /Appalling - book elsewhere!	I have had 3 one night stays at this particular hotel in 2007. The first was just tolerable, the second was pretty depressing &amp; the third (in November 2007) was utterly appalling. I have resolved never to return to this establishment; there are far, far better hotels in the area. Whilst the hotel is in a good location for many things, the hotel itself is quite dreadful. First visit - tried this hotel because the Novotel London Euston (now Novotel London St Pancras) was fully booked - large room but extremely oddly decorated. Bathroom window would not close &amp; noisy because of street traffic. Water supply very inconsistent but hotel blamed Thames Water with a big sign on reception. Buffet breakfast ok. Just tolerable. Second visit - again, Novotel Euston fully booked &amp; no time to find a better alternative - tiny/box room in which it was quite impossible to stand up straight whilst in the shower because of the curvature of the wall. Drab &amp; dirty. Again, buffet breakfast okay. Pretty depressing to say the least but only one night! Third visit (Nov 2007) - yet again, Novotel Euston fully booked - small room with double bed. Noisy because of first floor location. Balcony doors (onto busy Southampton Row) would not lock. Room service evening meal acceptable &amp; 7/10. Shower totally inoperative but wait for it - dried blood on the sheets &amp; dried blood on one of the towels on the bathroom! 150 per night????? Hence my resolution never to stay at this establishment ever again."
31,1334,"Nov 24 2007	Absolutely Apalling	How can staff like this ever gain employment!Rude, Unhelpful, Arrogant.They wouldn't know an acceptable level of customer service if it came up and smacked them straight in the face.Please, like many of my fellow Reviewers, please give this Hotel a wide berth and never ever go near it.It definately gives Customer Service in London a bad name!"
32,1334,"Nov 18 2007 	Awful in every way	I spent one night at this hotel as a solo female business traveller and it was without doubt one of the worst I have ever stayed in. The whole place is drab, old and grubby - yes as another reviewer said, even the lift. I was first shown to a room where the bathroom overlooked a flat roof. There was only a net curtain on the window and the window did not shut properly. I requested a move - the alternative room was almost as bad being next to a fire escape, again with windows that barely shut. I did not feel at all safe. The room was small and not very clean, there was no heating in the bathroom and the shower did not work at all. On check in I enquired about room service for breakfast &amp; hung the request list outside my room, asking for it to be delivered at 6.30. It didn't arrive and when I contacted reception I was told that no food was available till 7.00. The staff were rude &amp; unhelpful- really couldn't be bothered, none spoke good English. It was truly dreadful value. Two weeks earlier I stayed at the Thistle Bloomsbury for the same price and it was great. Don't touch the Waverley House...."
33,1334,"Oct 25 2007	Dirty	This hotel is awful in every way. The staff are rude, miserable and unhelpful. The glass lift is so disgusting. It's dirty! The tv's dont work in many of the rooms. The food is dry, over cooked and tasteless. Avoid this one! A budget hotel would be better than this."
34,1334,"Sep 27 2007 	Lovely hotel	A lovely hotel with a bar and a restaurant. Good rooms, but some noise from the street. Very short walks to West End and British Museum"
35,1334,Sep 27 2007 	Ideal Location	Just stayed at the Waverley House Hotel for one night to attend a business meeting the following day and I must confess that I was more than pleasantly surprised. Having booked a double room I was given the Aquarius Suite on the 5th Floor which was extremely spacious and comfortable and very quiet considering it faced the main road.The restaurant was quite reasonable and the self-serving breakfast in the morning more than adequate.My meeting was just around the corner in Bloomsbury Square and the location of the hotel was just ideal for my meeting and for Euston Station.
36,1334,"Sep 20 2007 	Don't stay here - even if for free	The staff was rude, not helpful at all, the room was quite expensive for what you get - more like a B&amp;B - Wouldn't recommend staying there - avoid where possible ..."
37,1334,"Aug 1 2007 	Be Warned!!!	My family and I booked in for the week at this central London hotel. I must say this has to be the worst experiance I have ever encountered in the hospitality business. The decor of the hotel is drab and in need of a complete overhaul. The food we ordered was not fresh and seemed to be micowaved. The cleaniness of the bedroom was not up to standard as was the bathroom...very annoying. The staff at the hotel seemed unmotivated and some members could only speak pigeon English, Faulty Towers springs to mind. If your thinking of booking then THINK AGAIN, I wish i certainly had."
38,1334,"Jun 2 2007 	not such a great spot	this place is fine if you want to stay in this neighborhood and can't get a spot anywhere else. It's clean at least. But terrible mattress, no decor whatsoever, so-so staff.... just not a great use of money."
39,1334,"Mar 16 2007	Excellent service	Last summer, our grandchild was hospitalized at GOSH. The staff members at the Waverly were wonderful. They were helpful in any and all ways, making a difficult time for us as easy as possible. The rooms were always clean and comfortable, breakfast enjoyable. We've stayed there since and have always found them ready to help, very comforting. It's location makes for enjoyable walks, shopping, and museum visiting. We recommend the Waverly Hotel highly."
40,1334,"Feb 15 2007 	Short Stay	Stayed here on the 11th of february for 2 nights. well they charged for 2 nights when we really only checked in 2am monday morning and checked out at 3am on the 13th. any ways they charged us the full whack for it. the receptionist was very nice when we checked in so late, and as the bar was closed he gave us a couple of beers to take to our room with us. rooms are very small but we were only looking for somewhere to put our stuff and have a few hours sleep in. shower was nice, did the job. breakfast was good and the bar in the hotel is nice too. location is great!! restaraunts and banks all next door and tube station 2 min walk. basically if u are looking for a hotel with good location and dont care about the wallpaper or the colour of the carpet then stay here."
41,1334,"Nov 6 2006 	Friendly and Helpful	Very friendly staff, who went out of their way to be helpful, especially the guy who returned my iPod I'd left there.Great location and good value for money. Breakfast was good."
42,1334,"Oct 10 2006 	NIce location hotel should be in Blackpool	Stayed in this so called 3* hotel Oct 08 &amp; 09th. The hotel is in a great location but after spending around 100 per night its better to get a travelodge!! We have stayed in hotels around the country and paid 15 quid each a night for better! The hotel is in need of modernisation and the rooms are like rabbit hutches, we were on the 7th floor and facing the rear of the property. On the plus side the hotel is clean and the breakfast was lovely (self service). As mentioned on listings before there are no irons or trouser presses in the rooms, the shower has a mind of its own and you can hear every thing from a room two doors away. Somebody had set their Nokia mobile phone to alarm at 7:30 ish every morning but they must have been a deep sleeper or already at breakfast as it was sounding every 5 mins...... not a problem as we were up but it is something to take into consideration if you like a lay in or are a light sleeper and you have the honeymoon couple on the same floor! The location is great with two tube stations a short walk away. We had a great stay in London but try another hotel for your base!!!!"
43,1334,"Oct 5 2006	Death Room	We dropped off our bags and walked around london for the day, exploring the sights. On return, tired and in need of respite we checked in to our room. It looked as if Rigsby had been the interior designer here. Shocked and in awe of it's garish colour scheme. My friend went to shower to refresh him for the night out, and was scolded like a naughty child. The bath shower mixer didn't have a working cold tap. Further more the basin was blocked and did not take any water away. I had to syphon the water into the toilet pan, by means of a plastic cup. One high point of our stay, was the movie channel. Which displayed the dvd menu screen for resident evil, constantly during our stay. I believe it will be still playing now. speaking of resident evil, the staff at the check in were unhelpful, and spoke little english. Not a smile was displayed between them. Breakfast was included, but we felt inclined to abstain. The view from the room was hideous, and detracted slightly from the view of the terrible room itself. Apart from that the stay was fine."
44,1334,"Sep 20 2006 	Shocking	This hotel was awful during my business stay. Salient points:No iron in room or upon request. I had to stand in the basement floor hallway and use the public iron on a disintegrating ironing board. Unacceptable, and hard to find as well.Breakfast was toast, bread or cornflakes. As cost included breakfast, I was stuck with paying for my breakfast elsewhere and not claiming it back.No A/C and the room was HOT. Additionally, there were women screaming across the courtyard and wolf whistling at guests who had opened the windows and curtains in an attempt to cool their rooms. This went on until midnight.The shower was like a hot coffin and the air extractor sounded like a helicopter.There weren't many directions plates, and the hallways were like a maze. There was one lift for the whole hotel, so I tried the stairs, and got lost more than once.A credit card scan was taken, but I was asked to pay on the evening before I checked out. Why?Decor was very dated."
45,1334,"Sep 1 2006	Good location but that's about it	We spent a week in August 2006 at the Waverley House. We've stayed in the Bloomsbury area before and found it a convenient area to walk to many popular sites in London. We couldn't get a room where we had stayed before and decided on the Waverley House. The room was clean, but hadn't been remodeled in a while. It was quite small, but we are used to that in London hotels. The mattress was very lumpy and uncomfortable. The window didn't close completely so there was a lot of road noise. The lighting was very dim. The front desk staff was not too helpful when we asked for travel information. The English breakfast consisted of the typical fare, no variety from day to day, and the food wasn't very fresh- cold toast, dry cheese, etc. I would find another hotel next time."
46,1334,"Aug 12 2006 	Never Again!	Stayed in Nov Reception on arrival rude and unhelpful! Room at top of hotel small, dingy, dirty, cracked tiles in bathroom, generally dirty and heating not working!! Breakfast the worst full english i've ever tasted. We went for romantic break but felt too cold and dirty to enjoy experience. For the money we were ripped off"
47,1334,"Jul 31 2006 	Not very friendly	The hotel is in a good area with only a 5 min walk to the closest tube station (Russell Square), when we arrived at the hotel the receptionist didnt even say hello when I was at the desk, I said we have come to check in, she just looked at her watch and said we were too early and that we would have to wait until 3pm, she didnt even offer us the service to take our bags for us, I had to ask her. She was really sourfaced and with that attitude should not be working on the front desk of a hotel.The room was very small and a little grubbly round the edges of the floor, the bathroom was tiny, and the room was extremely hot (no AC) however we couldn't sleep with the windows open as our room backed onto another building next door, with their roof terrace and all we could hear was the buzzing of their AC unit! we asked if there were any other rooms avaliable but there wernt and the receptionist had a real attitutde about investigating it anyway.The breakfast was ok but nothing special. However after all the negatives, myself and my partner had a very good enjoyable weekend in London, just not in the hotel!!"
48,1334,Jul 22 2006 	Hotel in need of updating	This hotel is in need of some updating. We stayed in a room in which the bathroom window did not close properly and the room generally was a little bit grubby. Can't fault the breakfast as it was lovely. Location wise the hotel could not be better placed. It is a 20 min walk to Covent Garden and 30 min walk to Regent St.
49,1334,"Jul 5 2006	Booking Nightmare	Having booked the hotel through the Aquarius Hotels website, four days prior to arrival, I arrived at the hotel to find that they had no record of my booking despite me having a print-off with the reservation number. I was advised that they were overbooked and on asking where our group of 4 were supposed to sleep, they recommended a hotel with apparent vacancies five minutes away. On asking how this could happen, he told me that their booking system had been down for the past 3/4 days but by his attitude and lack of concern/sympathy, I got the impression that overbooking was part of the hotel's policy and he was very used to having to turn 'booked-in' guests away. On request of the complaints book, I was handed a piece of A4 paper, which was clearly destined for the waste bin. Unless you are happy to spend a good part of your trip trying to source another hotel in central London, I wouldn't recommend booking here."
50,1334,"Jun 3 2006	Friendly area budget and clean Waverley	Within walking distance of the theatre district (and close to British museum, London Uni and shopping districts, in literary Bayswater) safe area at night, close to Underground (direct from heathrow) and buses, friendly and generally helpful staff, all you can eat English breakfast, old fashioned but clean huge rooms and bathroom with lots of supplies, and rather cheaper than others in its category, what else could you ask for?I don't go for the most budget category anymore (in London plenty cramped tiny rooms where you overhear everything from the next rooms and no view, unfriendly staff in most of my experiences) so for 10 more (80 to 105 twin or double on Expedia) it's a bargain.Rooms are a lot different (one to three huge windows, for instance).My favourite has a sofa, two armchairs, two desks two windows and a balcony beside the usual features, but it overlooks the street so is a little noisier.Get a room at the back that is not smaller. Enjoy."
51,1334,Oct 17 2005	Ideal cheap city break	I have stayed at this hotel 6 times over the last 18 months with a couple of female friends when we visit London for shopping or a show. It is a middle class hotel with all the basic amenities you would need. We always have a triple room on the 4th or 6th floor. I don't recommend a lower floor because of the traffic noise. The bathrooms are basic but adequate. The staff are always very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts are extremely good. There is a bar which is open very late for residents and a cocktail bar which is very pleasant. The hotel is situated within walking distance of two tube stops for shopping etc but quite honestly you could walk to Covent Garden. A taxi is very cheap and easy to hail right outside. The hotel has no parking but the Bedford Hotel opposite offers underground secure parking - 20 for 24 hours.
52,1334,"Jul 28 2005 	For one night only (thankfully)	I was only booked in for 1 night, as luck would have it. The place is in dire need of smartening up - scuffed paint everywhere. Bedroom was small (not at all unusual in London though), dated and erm, functional. Apart from the TV which didn't function at all...and the sink which was reluctant to empty. The decor was pretty gruesome - vomit yellow blown vinyl wallpaper, anyone ?Breakfast was adequate, although how much trouble is it to have fresh fruit rather than tinned ?The one saving grace was the central location, however I would not wish to stay there again."
53,1334,"Dec 13 2004	Plunged into darkness	Stayed overnight 9th December and was pleasantly suprised by the room considering the low price we were paying....clean bathroom, extra pillows, coffee maker. Unfortunately there was a power cut in half the hotel just as we had finished getting ready to go out. The staff couldn't have cared less...very laid back and didn't even inform new customers of the situation, very disappointed with their behaviour especially when the whole hotel was finally plunged into darkness. No apologies, no nothing. I know it wasn't their fault but a bit of common courtesy wouldn't have gone amiss."
54,1334,"Nov 10 2004	Waverley Daviley	What a barnstormer! I was staying at the hotel for a meeting of the Frome Cheesemakers Society, which was re-scheduled to london due to the Foot and Mouth crisis 3 years ago. The rooms were clean and the service was polite and helpful. Dave from room service was even able to offer us some late night nibbles!"
55,1334,"Jul 29 2004 	Horrible hotel bad service	I was booked at this hotel for a meeting at the Institute for Education and I checked out after one night. The rooms were horrible, very small, overlooking a dark brick building with awful bathrooms. The other professor that was with me instantly declared that we would leave this hotel--which we did. We went across the street to that Barcley--which had wonderful service and was the same price as this hotel. London is expensive but do your best to find other good deals--because this is not a hotel you want to be in."
56,1334,"Dec 9 2003	A not-so-friendly hotel	My recent stay at the Waverley House Hotel was disappointing, not so much because of the basic level of accommodation (including a fairly grotty and tiny bathroom) but because of the unfriendly and abrupt reception. As a 'local' (well someone from the 'friendly north') I was embarrassed at the way in which the person on the reception desk treated guests from other countries in such an off-hand and unhelpful manner. Having recently stayed in equivalent-price hotels in Paris and Barcelona - which don't always have a reputation for friendliness to 'foreigners' - I found the general atmosphere at the Waverley House Hotel extremely disappointing. Tourist hospitality certainly has a long way to go!"
57,1334,"Nov 10 2003	Good value comfortable	I have just returned from a theatre/shopping trip to London with my daughter. After booking the theatre tickets we decided to stay overnight and go shopping the next day. Finding a good, reasonably priced hotel was a nightmare. They were either overpriced or did not have good reviews.We eventually booked the Waverley House Hotel and just hoped for the best. We were not disappointed.Check in was supposed to be 3.00 pm, but we arrived early at 1.00 pm and were still able to get into our room and freshen up before our visit to the theatre (The Lion King - absolutely fantastic!).Our room was clean and comfortable with very friendly, helpful staff. The room was a good size, with all the comforts you need; soft, fluffy white towels, television, coffee machine and extra pillows! If I had to make one bad comment, it would be that perhaps a bit of decorating wouldn't go amiss - peeling paint, cracked tile, but it was still kept very clean. I had asked for a non-smoking room, which we got, and we were on the fifth floor, which had a good view of the main street.The full Englsih breakfast was very good - hot with a good choice (although the orange juice tasted a bit watered down!).We paid 70 for a twin room (inc breakfast) which was great value for money. After checking out we were able to leave our bags for the day and return to collect them at the end of our shopping trip.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will definitely use it for our next trip to London."

1,1338,Nov 20 2009 	Disapooined!	My partner and I visited the Westbury for a romantic couple of days. He had booked a show. We left our room to shop for a few hours on our return we rushed around getting ready for the night and both of us thought the other had moved a pair of his shoes WITHIN our suitcase. Also I couldn't see a scarf that I knew should have been in the bag.It wasn't until I got home that I realised the scarf had gone and a tube of cream; we then questioned one another and realised that someone had been through our suitcase. Security were informed but have never ever rung with a conclusion. It was odd that no one turned down our bed for the evening. My partner regularly stayed at this hotel for business and pleasure. He checked 8 clients and himself in for a business meeting in April. We will never return. In fact he is booked into another hotel in Mayfair next week. My parter used to stay here at least 8 times a year.
2,1338,"Nov 16 2009 	If you get a heavy discount youll get great value. Pay top dollar and you may be disappointed	Stayed there on Friday and Saturday night. Its a smart 5* Hotel. The rack-rate for their cheapest room is 450. I paid about a fifth of that and loved the place. If Id paid full whack I would have been unhappy. What I got was good value, but wouldnt have been for the full price. The niggles about the room were minor, but here goes. Initially I thought the bathroom was locked. The lock was faulty and the door difficult to open. The stopper on the sink didnt work, and the flow of hot water resembled a kitten pissing.The shower was in the bath, but the water didnt drain properly so I had a shower while standing in dirty water up to my ankles.In the bedroom the bed was comfortable, and road noise was only slight. Theres a nice combined TV and guest entertainment centre. To listen to music on that costs substantially. I was able to dismiss this as just a tacky irritation, but if Id paid a lot for the room Id be very disappointed. I also couldnt find anything in the room to say what time check-out was. Its a small detail, but its irritating to have to ring Reception to find out.On the plus side, the room was comfortable and stylish. The cocktail bar downstairs was excellent, with first class cocktails and very efficient service. The concierge kept our cases after we had checked out with no fuss. The location is very good. Its handy for Mayfair, shopping and Underground stations.One final niggle: The hotel is situated on Conduit Street, yet they list Conduit Street, Bond Street and somewhere else variously as their address. Having three different addresses made the place difficult to find and was unnecessary. They should decide on one address and stick to it.The bottom line is that your satisfaction with the place will depend on what you paid for your room. If you get a heavy discount youll get great value. Pay top dollar and you may be disappointed."

4,1338,"Oct 20 2009 	Not worth the money ...	The only plus side with this hotel is its location, being in a very nice neighborhood, close to Oxford Street, Regent Street and Picadilly. I stayed here in October for four nights and my major dissatisfaction was about the room. It was so small that I hardly had any space to get dressed/undressed. The furniture was worn out and did not give you the impression that it was cleaned properly. There were tiny, brown stains in my sheet (probably blood) which I asked to be changed. The bathroom was the worst of all. It was so tiny that I couldn't wash my hands standing in the center in front of the sink, but only on the right hand side, because the toilet seat was in the way! It was definitely not cleaned properly; there were hair all over the place and stains in the bath tub. The shower head had mould on it, which is absolutely unacceptable. As for the breakfast, for which we had to pay an extra 25 Pounds, there was no variety. In addition, the attitude of the stressful manager made you feel like you were in the way and that you had to quickly sit down, eat and leave. The next morning, we enjoyed our sandwiches at a nearby Pret-a Manger much more at a much lower price. To sum up, this hotel does not deserve the stars and I'm sure there are much nicer hotels around if one is prepared to pay around 250 Pounds per night."
5,1338,"Oct 15 2009 	Very nice experience	this was a very nice hotel. we had our 11 month old daughter with us and the staff accommodated us with ever request that we made. very close to many attractions and great shopping in london. during the 7 nights that we stayed there, a couple of celebrities were staying in the hotel also, that made the place even more exciting."
6,1338,"Oct 5 2009 	Glad we didn't pay full price	We were transferred from the Kingsway Hall, which was apparently overbooked, so on arrival at that hotel had to travel back across London in taxi, which the hotel did pay for, to the Westbury. It is a 5 star hotel so it felt churlish to complain.The location is fantastic so that is a definite plus. We had full breakfast included in our orignally purchased package, and on that front we also did very well, as the breakfast was excellent and the restaurant and service there were properly 5 star.The room was quite small, fine for the price we paid but again would have been very disappointed if we had paid the prices we've seen quoted. The finish was not fantastic, chipped light fittings (i'm being picky but this is supposed to be 5*). The bed was very comfortable and the black out curtains were excellent.Our two main gripes with the room were, first that there was no tea and coffee facilities, I mean you get this in a travelodge where they have purposefully stripped back to the bare minimum so what possible justification can there be?! I asked the receiption staff, who looked at me as if i were mad and said it could be brought to the room for 5. Now if i had paid for this hotel direct I would have been very upset about that! Second on the first morning of our stay there was no cold water so had a scalding shower and brushed teeth with hot water. There was no complimentary bottle of water either, clearly want to wring every penny out of you that they can! So overall, not all bad but definite room for improvement."
7,1338,Oct 4 2009 	sub standard for the price	I spent one night at this hotel. Check in was efficient although a request for a reduced breakfast rate was turned down! My room was tiny and quite cramped for one person even though it was a superior double. Bathroom is unbelievably tiny and NO Molton Brown toiletries as mentioned in some other reviews. The sound proofing is not very good and I could hear the conversation of the American tourist in the next room. Bar staff lacked the CAN DO attitude seen at other 5 star establishments and my request for a drink at 12 55 in the morning was met with a resounding &quot; sorry the bar is closed.&quot; Overall not an unpleasant stay but for the money I paid I expected alot more. You would be better off looking at the Radisson chain which offers 5 star hotels in central locations with free wifi and good breakfast deals. Some public areas at this hotel including lifts are quite tired.
8,1338,"Sep 27 2009 	Great location - Very cozy hotel - Go for the large rooms	I booked at the Westbury through booking.com a superior room. When we arrived at the hotel and entered the room i was just shocked with its small size. I immediately asked for an upgrade and paid an extra charge to move to a Deluxe King which was really beautiful. If you can afford to go for the larger rooms, this hotel is really really good. Perfect central location at the heart of Mayfair, it gives you access to shopping &amp; dining at some of London's hot spots. I cannot comment about dining as we were nearly all day out of the hotel. My experience from the front office staff &amp; the cleanliness of the room was very good."
9,1338,"Sep 19 2009 	Conveniently located - nice stay	Just spent 4 nights at The Westbury in Mayfair with my husband who was thereon business. Had a great stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting for business or leisure. Location is convenient for so much...5 minute walk to Piccadilly which is a main thoroughfare...Fortnum &amp; Mason, coffee/snack places, restaurants, and 2 tube stations nearby (Green Park and Picadilly). About a 10 minute walk to Hyde Park were I went jogging in the morning. Gym at the hotel is tiny (2 treadmills, 1 elyptical, 1 tv, set of weights, one machine)...but since Sept weather was mostly nice, I used Hyde Park. Area is up-market and similar to Upper East Side of NYC...luxury brand stores, etc. But, Regent Street isjust around the corner and they have all sorts of stores - luxury and H&amp;M, Top SHop, etc. Concierge booked us tickets prompty for a play one morning for that evening's performance. Hotel reception and concierge were great...everything professional and quick. Doormen always sweeping open the doors, never had to wait for a taxi, room was on the small side, but served its purpose...comfortable queen bed, nice marbled bathroom w/Molton Brown toiletries. Room service for breakfast was quick and delicious. Quiet sleeping.Clean, comfortable...priced better than other luxury hotels where we've stayed before(The Berkeley and Mandarin Oriental). Only drawback was the fitness center...but I believe they can recommend health clubs near hotel if that is an issue.Dinner one night (without reservation - went on early side) at The Wolsey on Piccadilly...grand space that housed a bank and a car showroom - lively, great food.Another night drinks at nearby Browns Hotel Bar...elegant scene. Definitely would stay there again."
10,1338,Sep 19 2009 	Nightmare	We had originally booked 2 nights at the Kingsway hotel and were relocated (&quot;upgraded&quot;) to this nightmare. I find it hard to believe that we didn't get to stay in the hotel we had booked in the first place - what the heck is going on? The room in the Westbury was minute by any standards and pretty basic in terms of facilities. Worst thing was at 10.00 pm a work crew arrived opposite to take-down or erect scaffolding and this went on until 3 pm the next morning. On the second night after the work commenced again we were relocated to a room at the back. About 10 minutes later when in bed someone entered our room. Shortly after I could hear the telephone ringing in the room next door - the walls must be paper thin. All in all a wretched experience. My advice would be to steer clear of the Westbury - and for that matter - the Kingsway. And yes - the staff were hopeless.
11,1338,"Sep 5 2009 	3 star hotel with 5 star pretentions	Our &quot;superior&quot; room looked out on a blank wall. No reading light for one of the beds. 4 captive hangers per closet. No coffee machine. Tissues and toilet paper not replaced until requested. Good location but long walk to nearest tube stop.Mike S., New York City"
12,1338,"Aug 27 2009 	Over priced cramped rooms and rude staff.	This hotel did not help a four-night business trip with a tough agenda. Although the room (a 'standard') was clean and quite comfortable it was tiny. But you can live with this, especially if you are out at meetings more than you are in the hotel, as I was. But it was the general lack of service that blew it for me. The staff were generally uninterested, to the point of being rude or dismissive. Room service was appalling - orders failed to show up and when they did housekeeping would leave the plates and cups lying around until you were forced to ask them to remove them. Virtually every request of any staff member, from 'can I have some more toast' at breakfast (over priced at nearly 30) to 'is there a post office near here' was met with a heavenwards look and an audible tut. Bottom line - I won't be going back. There are much better hotels in central London."
13,1338,"Aug 27 2009 	Poor Hotel	Westbury Mayfair- a great disappointment: expensive, tiny rooms and bathrooms, practically there are no closets, asking for breakfast in the room was a torture since the breakfast table/tray did not entered in the room, several broken accessories, poor amenities, etc....Service indifferent. Not at all a 5 star, We stayed there for 8 days and it was very unpleasant, try somewhere else!"
14,1338,"Aug 23 2009 	1st wedding anniversary to remember	Our 1st wedding anniversary will always be remembered and this is largely to do with the fantastic time we spent at the Westbury Mayfair. The location is perfect for the West End and well worth paying a little more for. The staff were all extremely attentive, friendly and helpfull. Our room was lovely with lots of Molton Brown product to enjoy. The breakfast was 5 star. Thank you to the Westbury Mayfair."
15,1338,Aug 11 2009 	Really nice hotel inspite of..............	Good things. Location to Bond street. Deluxe king room was beautiful .A pot of tea in our room was very reasonable and folks were nice every morning. View was ok. Great shower.Bad things: One out of two elevators never worked for 4 day stay. Lights in the fancy closet wouldn't go out unless stuffed tissue on the button; too funny. There were a lot of 'celebrities' in the hotel; so us 'peons' were tolerated. They charged me for internet when it didn't work.
16,1338,"Aug 1 2009 	Excellent location but tiny rooms and rude service don't give good value for money	I stayed in this very centrally located hotel recently for a long weekend. I was looking forward to some luxury and pampering. The reception staff were most pleasant and I could'nt have been happier with the close proximity to Oxford, Regent and Bond Streets. However, the room was tiny - so small in fact that the room service trolley couldn't fit inside! There was no room to walk or store two cases of luggage and certainly no where to sit or relax. I also visited the Polo Bar twice during my stay and on the second occasion found certain members of staff very slow and quite rude and unprofessional. This is not what I expected and is certainly not acceptable from a so called five star establishment. I have stayed in quite a few five star hotels in London and elsewhere, this is not one of them!"
17,1338,"Jul 22 2009 	Overrated and disappointing much better value elsewhere	We stayed for a weekend to explore the city. Although the reviews on Tripadvisor were mixed, I was expecting alot more than what we discovered:Rooms - Very small and cramped. Enough for one person but for two it really did feel quite squashed. Although, the bed was very comfortable. Hotel amenities - appeared somewhat dated and lacking. There are only 2 lifts for 222 rooms which means you have to wait a long time to use them and always packed and they are old. the lobby was smallish for such a big hotel and did not appear 5 star at all. Service - There appeared to be a staff shortage because we had to wait a long time for assistance at the reception desk. Concierge was very unhelpful. Only knew of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Couldn't really give suggestions of places to go and see around the city or even tell us where the Indian/Pakistan quarter of the city was so that we could whet our appetite trying different foods. Price - very expensive for what you get. Much better value can be found at other hotels in London."
18,1338,"Jun 30 2009 	5 stars all the way	This was our first time traveling aboard w/ our toddler son. The staff of the hotel could not do more for you, they were excellent. The staff there is incredible, I really miss the hotel and London. The amenities on the room and the pillows are fluffy and the bed was sooo comfortable!! The best sleep I had outside of my house in a longtime!!! I want to go back to the Westbury Mayfair. The tube is about a 10minute walk and the bus are not far at all and it takes you to all the attractions. The location could not be better in Mayfair, I always felt safe in London it is one of the best cities in my opinion; Piccadilly, Oxford and Regent Streets are with in walking distance from the Westbury hotel. Room service was the best . Of course I will stay here, again."
19,1338,"Jun 25 2009 	Great Location Only Slightly Above Average Hotel	Stayed here 3 nights for business. I've stayed in many 5-star hotels, and this is not a 5 star hotel by any means. Good Points:The caliber of the staff suits a 5-star hotel - doormen are prompt and helpful and check-in and out were uncomplicated with pleasant front desk service. You cant beat the location if you want to shop. Molton Brown products in the bathroom are wonderful.Bad Points:The room was shabby at best. I stayed in what was probably the lowest class of room. The furniture and capeting was dated and uncomfortable. The bedding was unimpressive, and I am still scratching bumps on my body from either from the sheets and/or bugs in the bed. Not pleasant! There is no iron in ther room, instead there is a pants press in the closet that looks like it's been there for 30 years and doesnt even work. The hairdryer in the bathroom also looks like it's from the 1980's and didn't work, instead, I stumbled upon a hairdryer that was plugged into the desk somehow and was in the desk drawer...so you had to dry your hair with the desk drawer open to get the cord to reach your head, in an already cramped space. The TV had about 5 english channels, all of which were news channels and made for incredibly boring watching when all you want to do is relax. You have to pay for internet access for each 24 hour period, so you have to keep paying each day when your 24 hours is up, very annoying. In this day, internet access should be free and any hotel that still charges is just being cheap. Overall I dont think I would stay here again or recommend it to anyone. Instead, I would warn them about potential bedbugs!!!"
20,1338,"Jun 13 2009 	Location LocationLocation!! 5 stars!!	I stayed at this lovely hotel the end of May and from start to finish it was AMAZING!!! The rooms are fantastic, the restaurant was 5 star and the Polo bar was fun and the head bartender makes the best Pomegranate Martinis!! I want to go back for the martinis, it left me wanting more. The staff of the hotel could not do more for you, they were excellent. The staff there is incredible, I really miss the hotel and London. The amenities on the room and the pillows are fluffy and the bed was sooo comfortable!! The best sleep I had outside of my house in a longtime!!! I cant want to go back to the Westbury, is all I ever talk about. The tube is about a 10minute walk and the 23 or the 3 bus are not far at all and it takes you to all the attractions. The location could not be better in Mayfair, I always felt safe in London it is one of the best cities in my opinion, I've been to Paris and its pretty close between the 2 of them. Piccadilly, Oxford and Regent Streets are with in walking distance from the Westbury hotel. OK, so it pretty obvious I will be staying at this hotel from all the wonderful comments. 5 STARS all the way and I've stayed at the best hotels in the world, Ritz Carlton Maui, Four Seasons Maui, Kea Lani, Grand Wailea, St Regis NYC and to me the Westbury was very close to scale in services and staff, from the hotels that I just mentioned!! IMO!! Cant wait to return, already planning the dates for my next visit!!"
21,1338,"Jun 5 2009 	Good enough but probably only stay if you need to be in the area	The hotel staff is very friendly and attentive. Check-in and check-out is always easy and comfortable. The rooms are typical for upscale London - small, quaint, classy. Not much more than that. I would prefer a larger space and better views. Most people stay here for the location - it is truly in the heart of the Mayfair district, making it especially well-suited for high-end shoppers, but less ideal as it's about 10 minute walk from the nearest tube stations (Picadilly, Oxford and Green Park). Prices in the restaurants and bar are high."
22,1338,"May 29 2009 	Luxury tranquility class.	Perfect stay at the Westbury Mayfair, having been badly letdown by the Waldorf Hilton. Booked Lastminute literally, and dashed across in a taxi. Had to wait 15 minutes for them to prepare the room but the rest of the two night stay was brilliant. We had breakfast in our room on the second day - very nice, will do this again.Stayed in a Deluxe King Room, the bed was huge! Nice sitting area with sofa, chair and coffee table."
23,1338,"May 27 2009 	Absolutely perfect	My mum and I stayed for 4 nights from 21st - 24th May and I can't fault this hotel. my only critcisim is that they should have tea making facilities in the room. Didn't bother me but my mum needs her morning coffee on waking! We had a deluxe kingsize room which was huge and luxurious. Enormous bed, lovely bathrooom with bathrobes and a large sitting area with sofa, chair and desk.We were very impressed with the level of service in the hotel and liked the fact that staff rang the doorbell at least once a day to ask if we needed anything extra like towels or toiletries. We also recieved a nice turn down service each night when the maid would close curtains, turn on lamps, turn down the bed and lay our nightwear out for us. We had room service twice - one breakfast and one dinner and this was excellent. Prompt, hot tasty food and a lovely table set up in our rooom for us. The concierge service was excellent and the bar staff were prompt and polite - although 12 for a G&amp;T and a 2.50 service charge is a bit on the expensive side!the location is PERFECT - a five minute walk in various diections takes you to piccadilly, the palace, oxford street etc and bond street is on your doorstep.All in all we loved the hotel and will stay there again on our next trip!"
24,1338,"May 17 2009 	Great service with a stellar location	My husband and I stayed here recently and we were very pleased with the concierge service. They enabled us to get soccer tickets for a hotly contested Chelsea/Fulham game--- very pricy but totally worth it. We also enlisted their help for mapping out directions and public transport to restaurants we had booked on-line. They could not have been more helpful. The room (superior double) was plenty roomy with lovely plush and comfortable beds. I got a great deal on-line ($220 a night) so all of this was a bargain as well. Not sure if my review would be as glowing if paying rack rate (around $500 a night posted at check-in). For the price we paid, this was a real winner!"
25,1338,"May 11 2009 	Good location!	The Westbury ,Mayfair has a fantastic location &amp; the rooms are of a good standard too."
26,1338,"Apr 27 2009 	Very Very Nice	Stayed here in the beginning of March for three nights. Nothing even remotely bad or dissappointing to report. Everything very nice - staff, room, comfy bed and pillows, clean bathroom. Nice touch to have a cappucino and a croissant in the lobby bar for breakfast if you're in a hurry. Woth the money - if you have it!"
27,1338,"Apr 13 2009 	Great location for shopping small rooms!	We stayed at the Westbury for Valentines night,Pleased with the location as it was a few minutes stroll from Tiffanys and just under 10 minutes from Fortnum and Mason on Picadilly.The lobby was impressive, the staff on duty very friendly. Check in very smooth. The only thing I would say is that I had enquired about getting a bottle of champagne in the room as a suprise for my partner and the reception asked if I still wanted this when I checked in! - Suprise ruined! The room was fairly compact, however had all the needed facilities. My partner had also arranged for some flowers to be in the room which were stunning so very pleased with that factor.We attempted to use the conceirge. I called down to ask if they could find us a bar showing the football - quite a feat as England were also playing rugby. The man on duty never called back. We called about an hour later and were apologised to by the man now on duty and he attempted to assist us on the phone.We did not use the hotel restaurant or bar as we had reservations elsewhere. We also did not use room service as the prices were expensive.The room was comfortable. We checked out the following morning and used the left luggage facility which was fine.All in all an average stay... the hotel was pleasant but not as great as some of the 5* hotels I have stayed in.There is nothing that sets the Westbury aside from other 5*'s in London."
28,1338,Mar 1 2009 	Over rated 5* but great location	stayed at Westbury for week end trip 28/2.Hotel is well located.Reception and lobby staff very good.We stayed in a standard room which for a 5* hotel is small.My partner continually bumped her leg on the furniture at the end of the bed where there was a gap of no more than 25cm.No tea and coffee making facilities in the room - even an average 2* hotel would offer this.Bed squeaked and staff service doors could be heard slamming late into the night.Good restaurant-food quality good.Bathroom matched the room-good decor but very small-single basin and one bathrobe between two persons.Molton Brown toiletries but enough for one bath or shower only.Much better 5* hotels in London.
29,1338,"Feb 20 2009 	fabulous hotel of bond street	me and my husband loved this hotel!! it was so fancy and stylish. although the our room was a standard dbl and a little small, we loved it anyway. in europe it's very common to stay in small hotel rooms, the thing is to be clean, nice and comfortable. this hotel had all of it! the lobby was very chic, and I can't remember it's name but the bar of the hotel was awesome! I strongly recommend you to stay there. by the way the location was great too! it's only a few mins away from piccadilly circus or oxford street. it was very central."
30,1338,"Feb 19 2009 	Great location quality rooms and service but a little dated.	Stayed here for 3 nights with the wife and our 1 year old son on a very good deal (staff rate roughly 90 per night, breakfast and room upgrade). The hotel is brilliantly located and the rooms were very generously proportioned. Our room had a separate living and sleeping area which is very handy with a baby and also makes hanging out in the room much more pleasant. The only downside to our room was that the two flatscreen TV's were very close to one another which meant that the remote on one also controlled the other (the living room TV would turn on when we changed the channel for the one in the bedroom) but that is a very minor complaint. The rooms were luxuriously appointed and befitting of a 5-star hotel, along with the courteous and professional staff. The styling veered at times on the tacky but that would probably suit the clientele who in the main wore over sized sunglasses and fur coats. The buffet breakfast was as expected and we ate some nibbles (Eastern mix, satay, pancake rolls, etc;) at the restaurant which was very nicely cooked. Have absolutely no complaints about the hotel considering the price we paid, don't think it is marketed at a couple in their late 20's (saying that we did bumped into Liz McLarnon of Atomic Kitten fame in the lobby) but we still had a enjoyable stay and left feeling much more relaxed than when we arrived."
31,1338,"Jan 27 2009 	Location is not everything	We stayed at the Westbury as a change from our normal London hotel, booking a deluxe room. This has to be the smallest deluxe room in the hotel industry, with barely 12 space between the bottom of the bed and the furniture and the same on one side. When we asked at Reception what is the difference between a standard and a deluxe room  we were told it was the size of the bed. So there you have it a king sized bed crammed into a standard sized room. Due to concert times we used room service twice. Both times the waiter looked around for somewhere he could reach to put the tray. On that side, room service is good. Expensive (but where isnt it?) but good hot food delivered within the time stated. The staff are all very pleasant but it is very superficial. They do not really listen to you or notice you, not what I have come to expect from other 5* London hotels. Motto of this  stay at the Westbury for its good Location, but unless you want a King sized bed, save your money and do not pay the extra for a deluxe room. At 5* the rating is higher than the hotel really deserves."
32,1338,"Dec 23 2008 	Nice but tired	Nice hotel in a perfect location  within a short distance from a busy Oxford street for shopping but situated on a quiet side street, drown in luxury boutiques. Very stylish lobby and helpful stuff. Tasty room service dinner, you should try prawn risotto. However the whole property is pretty old. Be prepared for tired dcor details. However, I had a good impression of Westbury Mayfair and would probably recommend the place."
33,1338,"Nov 25 2008 	Great location but hotel lacks a lot...	Great hotel and nice staff, especially the wonderful doormen. Wonderful location (just a short stroll from Regent Street, Bond Street and Oxford Street)But in my personal opinion, the hotel lacked on a few points.Bath towels were poor, scratchy and past their best. The bathrobe was the same... had seen much better days!Keep the Molton Brown goodies, a complimentary bottle of water would be a much better idea! Nicely stocked minibar but no tea/coffee making facilities (but is available on request) Its almost as the hotel just hasn't thought it through properly. Not worth the money in my opinion."
34,1338,"Oct 30 2008	Lovely hotel good location	Stayed here for a night in October with my wife. Arrived just before noon and we got the keys straight away after signing in, which took abot 5 minutes, staff all very friendly, 5 minute walk from Green park tube station, weather was lovely, so worth a walk, or cab from waterloo was 10, you're right on bond street , so all of the fashion houses are there, with the price tags to match, Leicester square / shaftesbury av is about a 10/15 min stroll . very easy to walk around, room was nice, we had a free bottle of red wine and toiletries while we were there. Not the biggest of bathrooms but more than adequate , never had an evening meal there, only breakfast. which was plentiful, visited their bar at night, a rich set of people is how i would describe the people in there, just one look at their bar menu says it all , a bottle of champagne was 35k .. can't see many of them getting drunk, the cheap plonk was a lot less than that, but a bottle of peroni was 6.. all in all a good hotel .."
35,1338,"Sep 29 2008 	Great location	We enjoyed our stay at the Westbury Mayfair. I was surprised by some of the negative reviews of the rooms. Our room was spacious and looked nearly new. The furnishings were very stylish and comfortable. The staff was friendly and attentive.However, the bathroom does need some updating, moreso the shower and bathtub but still in good condition.Considering the prices of hotels in London, especially central hotels I found the price to be reasonable. ."
36,1338,"Sep 2 2008 	Very nice Hotel	This was a great hotel. The location is perfect for the Westend. We stayed in the hotel for only 1 night, we were going to see the Sound of Music, and the hotel is only 5 minutes walk away.The hotel reception is very posh, and it feels like a 5* hotel. You are greeted by the doorman with a smile. The reception staff are very friendly and polite.We booked a Queen room, which was very nice and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the linen had a feel of luxury.Bathroom was very clean, and had Molton Brown goodies to wash with (or take home). The shower was very powerful.We didn't eat in the hotel so cannot comment on that.Overall, great hotel in a superb location."
37,1338,"Jul 29 2008 	Loved the location and elegance	We very much liked the elegance but above all the location of this hotel. We noticed how hard it is to get a decent twin room in London and were very happy with our room. Even though the room was not very large, we had enough space to place our things away.Having stayed at a 'cheap' hotel the previous days, we felt that we should have booked the whole stay in London at the Westbury. The value for about GBP 40 more compared to the 'cheap' hotel was tremendous and we'll keep this in mind for our next visit to London. The only negative experience was with the information we were given by the concierge about opening hours for the London tourist attractions. On two occasions we were not given proper answers. The TV menu was not overwhelming for German speaking guests and I agree with earlier comments that it is difficult to get through the various options with the remote control.I'd like to specially mention the very kind and friendly doormen. They made us feel very special even though we obviously were no businesswomen or models. They seemed to be able to read our minds and took really good care of us."
38,1338,"Jul 20 2008 	Great Location Expensive rooms and extras	I have stayed at the Westbury a number of times for business. I find the attraction of the hotel is its location-thats really it. Located on the corner of Bond St and Conduit St, its in the hear of Mayfair and thus convenient to both business and shopping in that area. It is also a 10 minute taxi from Paddington Station, so the Heathrow Express is reasonably convenient. Berkley Square, Regent Street, Oxford Street, Piccadilly, and St James are all within easy walking distance. The tube is also convenient, so trips out to Canary Wharf on the Jubilee Line are fast, and both cheaper and quicker than taxi. It's also close to Hyde Park for morning exercise. I find that I can accomplish quite a lot, both business and personal, just due to the convenient location. The hotel upgraded its lobby about two years ago, so the lobby as been improved. Before that it was pretty dingy. The Polo Bar is a nice meeting place, the drinks are fine, but expensive.I have experienced a number of different rooms. My favorite are the deluxe king rooms that look out over Bond Street. These rooms are sunny in the morning. These rooms also include a couch rather than chair and are a little more roomy than the standard room. The worst rooms are the standard rooms located in the center of the hotel.There is one restaurant, located just off the main lobby. The breakfast is outrageously expensive, over 20 pounds, like most hotels in central London these days. This seems to be a new profit center for hotels in London. I recommend walking around the corner to the small cafe across from the LV store for a full English breakfast with coffee for 5 pounds instead of the hotel restaurant. There are also places to get pastries and coffee nearby at Berkley Square at a fraction of the cost of the hotel. When not out for a business dinner, I always get take out from one of the restaurants in the area, rather than order room service. The hotel also aggressively markets its pay for video service, which is a pain. In order to view regular TV, a confusing choice of video options must be navigated to avoid mistakenly agreeing to the video package at another 20 pounds. It would be much better if the TV just worked as a TV. The hotel did upgrade to big flat panel TVs in the past year, which is a big improvement over the old plastic models that were formerly in place.The bathrooms are quite small but clean. Molten Brown amenities are provided, which is nice. There are also two terry robes, and the towels are hung on a towel warmer.The mini bar is another problem - the goods are automatically charged, which prevents keeping your own drinks in the fridge. I have in the past just removed and replaced the hotel items, then disputed the charge upon check out (successfully).The staff are always courteous and attentive. The concierge staff take care of all my requests promptly and the doormen always volunteer to hail a taxi for me, even going out into the rain to hail one down. Over the past two years the Westbury has also raised prices quite a bit. I always thought it was expensive at 200 pounds/night, but now weekdays can be over 300. Perhaps the slowdown in the financial markets (and the insolvency of many of the firms located nearby) will prompt a re-think of room rates.The Westbury is fine as a business hotel, and is great for shopping in Mayfair, Regent Street and Oxford Street. Its expensive, but convenient. I would re-think my choice of hotels if I were on personal and not business expense."
39,1338,Jul 17 2008	horrible hotel	I had heard a lot of horrible things about this hotel before my stay.I found out by myself that it was true! I will never recommend it to anyone and will never stay there again
40,1338,"Jun 18 2008 	Great location	Stayed at this five star hotel for one night after getting a great deal but had to shop around. The hotel is only 5 mins away from a variety of tube stations and is not a problem if your carrying minimal luggage. The stay itself was great and the staff are very polite and helpful, the rooms are a little small for a five star hotel and i was in the king executive suite. The only flaw of this hotel i found was the bathroom was a bit dated and especially the shower which was over the bath style, although clean it did need doing up. Apart from that a great hotel for the price i paid..."
41,1338,Jun 17 2008 	We like it here	We've stayed here quite a few times now and always find everyone very helpful. It is normally rather pricey in the week but you can get good weekend deals. I like the fact that breakfast is freshly cooked and when they found out my husband was gluten free they produced GF bread the next morning for him. Such a good location and (unusually for London) they seem to make an effort to employ English speaking staff.
42,1338,"May 24 2008 	great location over-rated value	After reading previous reviews I had high expectations of the Westbury. I was very disappointed. The location, being close to the tube and shopping, was fantastic. However, the rooms were small and a little tired, not up to scratch for a 5 star hotel (and I do know my 5 star hotels). The door to our room was very narrow. The suitcase had to be pushed through first, then the porter came after. The bathroom was clean, but small and in need of updating. This was a superior king room. No tea/coffee facilities in the room but could be ordered at a cost of 5 pounds. Could not use the bar fridge for my own stuff as items are automatically charged when they are &quot;removed&quot; to make space. Breakfast was not included in the rate I paid (2,200 pounds for 7 nights) and was very expensive (in excess of 20 pounds). On one morning when the restaurant was full, breakfast had not arrived an hour after ordering and had to be abandoned. At other times the service was fine. Generally the staff were polite although not entirely helpful. The business centre printer had broken down and our party had to actually purchase a printer to get on with our work. The hotel internet connection was constantly dropping out and slowing to a snails pace. Honestly all the previous trip advisor reviews are over-rating this hotel! I would not go back there."
43,1338,"Apr 14 2008 	Amazing Location!	Booked this hotel by chance on Lastminute as one of their top secret hotels. Got a really good deal for a saturday night in central London, the weekend of the London Marathon. Could not believe our luck when we were told we had booked the Westbury...Amazing location, everything felt like it was a 5-10minute walk away.Hotel-lovely sized room for London, clean, very comfy bed. Shower was a little disappointing, we like them to be powerful!Staff - polite, friendly, lovely door staffPolo Bar- great drinks, at extremely expensive prices, but you are in Mayfair after all!Breakfast, not included in this deal, was an extra 24 per person! But lovely french patisserie not too far on Great Marlborough Street.Overall a jolly decent stay and would definitely go back if we can get a deal like this again, we thought it was worth the 150!"
44,1338,"Apr 4 2008 	Great Location Fab service	Great experience. the fit-out is excellent, but what really sets this hotel apart is the warm service from all staff. Excellent barstaff and helpful concierge, can't wait to get back. Location is unbeatable for shopping."
45,1338,"Feb 20 2008	another wonderful london hotel	stayed in nov 06, dined at brian turners millenium hotel. another wonderful weekend break.i am aiming to stay at every 5 star hotel in london."
46,1338,"Jan 27 2008 	Overwhelming!	I stayed here for just one night as a transit stopover in London on Boxing Day and thoroughly enjoyed everything about the hotel. I was initially greeted by a rather useless doorman, however it felt quite posh walking in the front door with only my rucksack. The reception staff were extrodinarily helpful with general knowledge about the surrounding area, and transport inquires. Skip the offer on help with your luggage... the hotel isn't the size of Heathrow, and it took rather a long while to get to my room anyway. The room was beautifully decorated with warm colours, comfortable furniture &amp; fantastic bedding. Though the room wasn't the largest I've ever overnighted in, there was nothing wrong with it. Still very comfortable, and perfect to have a friend over for a cup of tea. Except the fact there aren't tea making facilities in the room which was rather a disappointment. The bathroom was nice, though nothing extrodinary. However the Molton Brown toiliteries were a great touch.On my next stay to London, I wouldn't hesitate to book here again as it is very central indeed, and just an 8 minute walk to the nearest Tube station. However I wouldn't even think about paying the posted rate of 386 in the lobby, but the 130 I paid off LondonTown.com made it quite worth while indeed."
47,1338,"Jan 16 2008 	Very Poor Value	Chose this hotel because of its location and reviews. - we normally stay elsewhere.Front of house staff very professional and public areas very nicely designed but what a dreadful room!Smallest room we have ever had - barely enough space to pass between the bed and cupboards, extremely hard and uncomfortable bed, tiny bathroom, weak shower and no tea/coffee making facility. Our room (almost predictably) directly above the dustbin area with the resultant horrendous noise at 4 am!!I know this is London but nearly 50 for 4 gin &amp; tonics is a bit on the steep side!"
48,1338,"Nov 26 2007 	would never stay there again if given a choice	Was in London on business and my usual hotel was booked, so had to stay at the Westbury. It claims to be a 5 star hotel, and charges somewhere in the neighborhood of 240 pounds (plus 17.5 VAT and 5% service) for a superior queen room, which I believe is what I had. It was either a superior queen or king.The room was tiny, and the 2 of us were constantly stepping on each other's toes as we tried to unpack, get to the closet, get to the bathroom, etc.The bathroom has Molton Brown products, but only shampoo and body wash. When I very politely asked the concierge if he could arrange for some lotion as the cold winter weather was taking a toll on my skin, he claimed they didn't have any. After I asked again he then grudgingly dug up a small bottle. It turns out I had forgotten a toothbrush, and when I requested one I was subsequently charged 3 pounds for a tiny plastic travel toothbrush. I have NEVER stayed at a 5* hotel where they charge you (especially when you are a corporate guest with many colleagues also staying in the hotel!) for a toothbrush! They provide robes but no slippers, and I didn't particularly want to put my bare feet on the worn looking carpet.Walls in the room were so thin that not only could I hear my neighbor's TV out in the hall, but also in my room until 2:30am. Unfortunately this means I also heard their wakeup call at 6am, because the phone sounded loud enough to be the one on my bedside table.On a positive note, the bellmen were very nice. If given a choice I would not stay there again. There are other hotels in London where you get better rooms and service for $500 USD per night."
49,1338,"Oct 31 2007 	Very very poor allround	We travel from Australia to London regularly for business and always stay at Five Star hotels. The Westbury Mayfair was recommended to us by business colleagues but we were extremely disappointed with the overall experience at this hotel.Reception staff were decidedly disinterested and uncommunicative. They could not direct us to the closest supermarket and housekeeping staff could speak little or no English. Several requests of housekeeping staff produced either no response or the wrong response (i.e. a request for a hot water bottle produced a bottle of body lotion). Despite repeated requests, newspapers were not delivered to our room on any morning of our stay.As per most 5 Star hotels, the Westbury provides bathrobes for use by guests. The inside of the bathrobe in our room, was smeared in faecal matter from a previous guest. When we showed this to a member of housekeeping she did not seem particularly interested and only agreed to replace it at our request. When this and other problems we experienced at the hotel were brought to the attention of the Duty Manager, his response was simply &quot;these things happen&quot;.The rooms are very small and there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. If you want this you have to pay GBP6 per day plus 12.5% gratuity for room service staff to deliver it. We asked for tea facilities in our room and they were removed each day despite our request that they be left in the room. We ordered a Martini via room service. It arrived in a Scotch tumbler and was only a nip of Cinzano. We would have expected that bar staff in a 5 Star hotel would know how to make a Martini. When, at our request, a staff member correctly made a Martini we were charged for both drinks.We wrote to the hotel manager following our return to Australia addressing the various problems we experienced and no response has been received to date.Under no circumstances could we stay at this hotel in the fututre and could not recommend anyone else stay there. The hotel has recently been awarded a 5 star rating and sadly it falls very short of the calibre required. The only favourable comment we can make about this hotel is its location which is very close to where we like to stay in London."
50,1338,"Oct 27 2007 	Great location very small room.	My husband and I booked this hotel for a 1 night break. The location was fantastic but our room was really small. Just about enough space to move around the bed with a chair and desk crammed in. The bathroom did have a bath but the wash hand basin was awkwardly positioned almost over the toilet. Although placed at the front of the hotel our room was quiet- we were on the 5th floor. We ate in the Artisan restaurant having found a deal on Toptable of 50% off the food. The food was good, sadly they had run out of scallops as a starter and I had to send my salmon main course back to be correctly cooked through. The restaurant staff were attentive but slow - my husband had finished his main course by the time my salmon was eventually returned cooked, I wasn't given fresh cutlery and the delicious white wine was poured by the Sommelier along with a considerable amount of sediment. When I drew this to her attention she offer to &quot;fish it out&quot; for me - not very professional!I would recommend this hotel due to its location and its cleanliness. Watch out for unreasonable service charges automatically being added to all the bills for the cleaning staff as well as the bar a restaurant service charge."
51,1338,"Sep 6 2007 	Good all round hotel in a great location	We stayed here over the August Bank Holiday weekend. I couldn't fault the hotel - great location (2 minutes from Regent Street), with good sized rooms that are well maintained (loved the Molton Brown toiletries, and even the TV speaker in the bathroom). We had a 4th floor room at the back of the hotel, which was wonderfully quiet at nights for London. The staff were helpful, and discreet, and the breakfast (which was included in our stay) was tasty, with lots of choice, and served in their gorgeous restaurant. Would happily stay there again, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
52,1338,"Aug 27 2007	Great Hotel-central location	Great location on bond street, perfect for shopping 2 minute walk from oxford street, or in other direction 2 minutes from piccadily and regents street. Impressed with the luxury interior of the hotel, only one let down-when we checked in, we had booked a queen room and were asked if we wanted to upgrade for 20 pounds to a king room (larger bed/room/bathroom, and has iron instead of just trouser press in room) , so we did, but when we went to the room they had given us on the second floor i was convinced it was still a queen room that we would have recieved even if we hadnt paid the extra 20 pounds. i called reception and they sent up a lady who confirmed it was the larger king room, even though i argued it didnt look like it- and didnt have the ammenities such as iron, she convinced me it was. after she left i was still feeling annoyed that they were trying to fool us as we were young, so went to reception and asked if we could be moved to another king room, to which they agreed. When we arrived in the room This time on the top floor (7th floor) it was very clear our room before definatly wasnt a king room, and we had been lied too-which really annoyed me. but didnt let it ruin my weekend-the real king room was alot larger-the bed has three pillows accross it rather than 2 pillows as on a normal double bed-also have iron, and 2 dressing gowns in bathroom rather than just 1 in the queen room. apart from that hassle, the room, hotel and staff were great (apart from the lady on reception who had falsley claimed we were in a king suite who wouldnt look our way everytime we passed reception). breakfast was included with our room, really good food, great selection of english breakfast, hams, cheese, breads, pastries, all buffet. In all, great hotel, good value compared to other london hotels i have stayed in, rooms alot larger than most in cenral london, even the smallest queen room larger than average london hotels, would definatly stay again, will just be wiser if i upgrade that king rooms are on higher floors, so dont be fooled if you pay for king and they send you to 2nd/3rd floor."
53,1338,Jul 28 2007 	Superb location  perfect for London	If you want somewhere right in the middle of the west end not part of a large chain and not paying unreasonable prices with easy access to shops and nightlife this is it. Service was professionally friendly and rooms were a good size for London. Watch however hotel is going through a refurb - plus of which is a good rate but downside was early wake up with builders down the hallway and temparmental hot water system.As you would expect it's functional and not much lobby or bar space but food in the restaurant was excellent for breakfast. Definitely going back but I'll check where the refurb is first.
54,1338,"Jul 17 2007 	A night of luxury	Thanks to the reviews and feedback from a couple of travellers who stayed here, we eventually booked a queen superior with breakfast included via the hotel website.When we checked in, we were overwhelmed with a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe king on the top floor. On arrival to our room we were greeted with complimentary bottle of water, bowl of fruits and chocolate truffles from room service.The room was spacious and lovely decorated. The bathroom had speakers that tuned in to the TV if you wished to hear the TV whilst indulging yourself into the Molton Brown bath soaks and bath robes. We went to the Polo bar for pre-theatre food and drinks and had breakfast at the Artisan that were both off the Lobby. A great night of luxury for our anniversary in a perfect location..."
55,1338,"Jun 16 2007 	A baragin for the area!	We stayed at the Westbury at the begining of May. The hotel is in an excellent position and is perfect for shopping and entertainment. We booked last minute and for 190 had a superior room with a half bottle of Champagne thrown in, and breakfast included! This was booked direct with the hotel. Only minor points would be the bathroom was a little small. Otherwise, excellent value for location. We will return."
56,1338,"May 30 2007 	Great for shopping and nightlife	Having stayed at this hotel a couple of years ago we chose it again out of a mixture of sentimentality and because of it's location. The standard of the hotel hadn't changed and it is still excellent. Receiption were very efficient and even though we had arrived before the check in time we were upgraded and shown to our room in a matter of minutes. The conceirge was very helpful in finding us a lovely restaurant in Bruton place. The rooms have changed in decor from a couple of years ago and now are the modern contemporary design, think we perferred the plush decor from our last visit!The molton brown products are still used but limited to just shower gel and shampoo.The only negative point that means that we may return to the cavendish is that there were no tea/cofffee making facilities, after shopping for hours it's a good way of relaxing before going out in the evening."
57,1338,"Apr 29 2007 	Great location!	Service was great and the concierge very helpful. Location excellent with in easy walking distance to shopping, restaurants and theaters. Quiet room that was good size on an upper floor. Bathroom on the small size but fine."
58,1338,"Apr 15 2007 	Amazing Stay	We stayed at The Westbury hotel at the weekend for 1night(saturday). Check in was smooth and when we walked in the room was nicely decorated. The room was very spacious and clean. A wonderful bottle of complementary wine and fresh friut basket was a lovely touch. The bathroom had a lovely molton brown products. Also we had room service and the food was very good...nice selectionof inroom dining. The hotel is located on conduit street which is PERFECT for shopping,dining,and bars and clubs and everything is at your door step! The service here is very good from the minute you walk in to the friendly and helpful staff. We will definately return to this hotel in the near future."
59,1338,"Apr 11 2007 	Nice hotel with excellent location but very small rooms...	My bf and I stayed at this hotel over Easter weekend. During our previous London stays we would usually book at the Hilton Green Park, but this time decided to try another hotel. The location is excellent, on Conduit Street, which is a side street of Regent Street; it is a 5 minute walk to Oxford Circus and Carnaby Street and a 10 minute walk to Soho and Piccadilly Circus, so very convenient. The staff at the hotel were very polite and nice. Breakfast buffet was excellent, with a good choice of fruits, fresh juices, pastries, eggs, sausage, etc. You could also order delicious cappucini that would be brought directly to your table. Our only complaint was that the room (classic queen) was very small, even by London standards, and the bathroom was tiny too. But it was comfortable nevertheless and we slept very well, so were pleased anyway. All in all we enjoyed our stay in London and would go back to this hotel, but next time we would try the King or Superior Room, which seem to be larger."
60,1338,"Mar 11 2007	Great London Hotel	Just returned from a stay at the Westbury Mayfair. We are a couple in our late 30's and were in London for the first time to celebrate our anniversary. The Westbury Mayfair was an excellent choice for us. We were able to check in early upon arriving from the airport and were put on the 6th floor in one of the newer rooms. The room wasvery nicely appointed but on the small side (which was excpected in a city and it was similar to what we've found in NYC Boutique Hotels). The room and furnishings were sleek and modern while still warm and comfortable. The bathroom was small, but very modern with heated towel racks, upscale toilteries and bathrobes. The bed was a bit firm, but comfortable. The location was excellent, right on Conduit Street (off Old Bond - which was confusing for the cab driver, because our reservation said Bond Street, not Conduit). We could walk down Old Bond and window shop at Burberry, Tiffany's, Louis Vitton, Dolce etc. on our way to Picadilly. We often caught the tube at Picadilly or Greens Park (but actually walked alot in order to take in the city). We booked our room thru British Airways (even though we didn't fly with them) and got an excellent rate that included breakfast. The breakfast was very well done with white linens, Waterford china and silver. (But I don't know if I would have paid the $$$ for it if it were not included). The lobby, bar and restaurant were beautifully decorated and the service was excellent. Overall, the hotel was perfect for us. It is in a fashionable upscale neighborhood that is a quick stroll away from a bustling tourist area with plentiful dining and shopping. I would stay at this hotel again in a minute."
61,1338,"Mar 5 2007 	Good hotel great service	We did stay here for 3 nights in February... The hotel is really nice in a really nice area (arount 15 nimites to the undergrount) the check in was really slow... The girl in the reception did charge as 160 pounts more by mistake (when we check in ) but the MR in the check out notice that and send the money back...The rooms are big (we did have three double room ) really nice ... the bathrooms are new big (with bathtub) and they do have bathrobes (my room had only one :( )we did have two rooms facing the street and one facing an other hotel (that was the most quite , we did try the breakfast in the first morning it was ok and a really nice room with really really nice decoration ( i think that why it cost so much 23 pounts p.p ) it was a good experians but did not worth all this money (we were 6 people x 23 pounts is total 138 pounts only for breakfast) there is some traditional pabs and other places just few blocks away that you can have full english breakfast with coffe and juise in the price of 4.5 pounts (the best english breakfast i have try really tasty) we did have really good time i think i will go back in this hotel....  PS we did book from www.londontown.com they making really good offers...."
62,1338,"Mar 4 2007 	Nice fairly quiet upmarket area close to main attractions	The Westbury is in a nice, fairly quiet backstreet location surrounded by designer jewellers and boutiques with only a few minutes walk to the main shops and attractions. Check in was quick and efficient, the rooms are a decent size and very clean, although in need of some modernisation and decoration. We booked a family room that consisted of a king size bed and sofa bed which was very uncomfortable. Breakfast is served in the restaurant buffet style and there is a large selection to choose from. Hotel suitable for business or overnight stay but for us, lacked character and friendliness. Wouldn't recommend for families. Whilst content with our stay, probably wouldn't be tempted to stay here again."
63,1338,"Mar 2 2007 	Very inconsistent room quality	I have stayed at this hotel three times. It has a fantastic location and the bar/reception areas are wonderful.However, the room types vary considerably. The first time and second time I stayed was in a standard room. This was fine though VERY small. On our 2nd visit the shower in the bathroom broke and flooded the bathroom. I complained to reception and was moved to a much larger (king deluxe room). I was so impressed with this room that I decided to book this room type for my third visit.On my 3rd visit I was extremely disappointed to enter a room (supposedly deluxe king) which was no bigger than the standard room. This was also for my anniversary and I had informed the hotel of this before my stay. The decor in the room was quite dated too. I queried with reception whether they had allocated the correct room - they said they had but as I was so unhappy they offered us a new room - WOW what a difference. This was supposedly the same room type but was on the top floor and newly renovated. It was gorgeous. My advice is if you stay here ensure you get a decent room - insist on a newly renovated room. Also upon checkout they had charged the incorrect room rate so double check that too."
64,1338,"Feb 18 2007 	Weekend at the Westbury	We stayed at the Westbury because it was close to threatres, Bond Street shops and we got a good late deal on the hotel website.We found the Westbury average and not a premier 5 Star hotel.The room we had was 'worn' and needed attention to bring it up to the usual 5 Star standard. The expected room amenities were also lacking i.e. complementry Fruit or a bottle of water.We were suprised to find our credit card had been charged before the bill was presented to us to check."
65,1338,Feb 18 2007 	All about location	We have just returned from two nights at Westbury. The location of this hotel cannot be beaten. Just off Bond Street and within ten minute walk of the West End. The hotel was above average for price paid for early deal on hotels.com. The staff were all very helpful espeially Nic the conceiage who booked a fantastic retaurant around the corner from the hotel on the Friday night when all personal efforts to find a restaurant at short notice were failing.One complanint being that on returning to our room on Saturday afternoon housekeeping had either not yet arrived or forgot to clean room. One telephone call to reception had this problem resolved.
66,1338,"Jan 25 2007 	superb time again at The Westbury	We have just spent a night at The Westbury, making a weekend of a Saturday business meeting. This was our second stay here and, as ever, we could not fault the hotel. Service was excellent and we had a fantastic meal at Artisan on Saturday evening - shame we were one of only two couples that evening, but as a result, we had wonderfully friendly service with staff who had time to chat about the food, wine and football! Highly recommend the Westbury and we are already looking forward to our next trip."
67,1338,Jan 1 2007 	Great Location	The Westbury Mayfair is centrally located for both shopping and gallery visits. It is a short walk to both Regent and Oxford Streets and a few blocks to the National Gallery/Portrait Gallery and the Royal Academy of Arts.The hotel is clean and the staff friendly. The breakfast at the hotel is expensive. I would recommend Leon's the small cafe behind Liberty's. The porridge is particularly good!There are some very good restraurants near the hotel. For something different Sketch has a vibrant atmosphere and excellent food.I would certainly recommend this hotel.
68,1338,"Oct 30 2006 	Loved the hotel	Stayed for one night on Friday 28th October - got a good rate through work. Was offered an upgrade upon checkin for 20, which I took. Room was large for London, and nicely finished. Bed was comfortable and very wide. Bathroom good, marble tops and powerful shower (Room 502). The room was extremely quiet, and although looking out over Conduit St there was no noise. Breakfast was a buffet affair, but well worth having with lots of selection, and very fresh. Location for Bond St, Regents and Oxford was first class. Walking distance to some good bars, including Malt and Sandersons (take your credit card!). Nearest tube was Bond St and Oxford Circus . . . . 5 minute walk to both.Did not venture to the leisure facilities despite every intention!Staff helpful and attentive.All in all a good hotel. Not sure what the full price should have been, but for the deal I got, well worth it."
69,1338,Oct 27 2006 	would stay there again	After a very long flight from Australia we found the Westbury very comfortable and quiet. Its ideal for the tourist on the go as it is close to everything with only a 5 min walk to Oxford Circus Station. Good breakfast and staff very friendly and helpful. This is a classy hotel and very reasonably priced and lived up to the recommendations of others who have stayed here. We wouldnt hesitate to stay here again.
70,1338,"Oct 11 2006 	only ok	I just stayed here, it cost for 245 for the night it was very average, the room wasn't the biggest and narrowed off as it was on a corner, as another reviewer said there are no tea / coffee facilites so you are forced in to the mini bar / room service. I also had the lovely noise of drilling outside my room also at 9:15am. If you are over 6ft you can expect to shower from your shoulders down as teh showers are fixed into the wall.Staff were very friendly, however there seems to be so many of them hanging around the lobby greeting people.Not worth the money, you are really paying for the location."
71,1338,"Sep 20 2006	Great deal on great London hotel	We got a great deal (80 pounds/night incl. breakfast) for a December 2005 stay for three nights. (We had stayed in an awful hotel/hostel the night before through a free BA travel deal.) We were extremely impressed with the decor, service, cleanliness, convenient location, and breakfast. The room was small, but for two people it was just fine. The bathroom was very nice -- marble, great shower, MB toiletries replaced each day. The breakfast was a huge buffet of fruits, cereals, breads, jams, cheeses, meats, as well as eggs, sausage, etc. Waiters also took individual orders for tea, coffee, juices, etc., and omlettes. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Don't make calls (even local) from the room though -- terribly pricey. Location was perfect -- Bond St. is full of exclusive shopping and was decorated beautifully for Christmas with lights strung across the street. It is a bit difficult to find since it's not actually on Bond St., but just off it. Once you do find it, you'll be happy, though. It's within walking distance to two main Tube stops: Oxford St. and Green Park.If we got the same deal again, we'd return in a heatbeat!"
72,1338,"Sep 10 2006 	Adequate 4 star hotel	Have just returned from a one night stay at the Westbury hotel. Good location, although feel the hotel have used the 'bond street' address as an ability to add an extra 100 pounds for the room. The hotel is located on conduit street, which is just off of Bond Street. Staff were all pleasant and helpful, with a good service provided. The room we had was on the small side, but contained all necessary items. Bathroom was pretty spacious considering the size of the room, with Molten Brown toiletries for use. It also contained a very powerful shower! All in all an enjoyable stay, but slightly overpriced, despite already booking at a reduced rate."
73,1338,"Sep 4 2006 	Terrific Value - if you get a deal	I noticed a deal on 'laterooms' and booked a double room for only 109. The room was small (I could have upgraded for an additional 20) but we were using it as a crash pad for a Friday night out and Saturday of shopping. The staff were very pleasant, the check out was 11am and they stored our bags while we hit the Bond Street shops. I give this top marks for value. Breakfast not included (and is exhorbitant in their restaurant) but we found a Cafe Nero round the corner where we could get a continental breakfast."
74,1338,"Jul 17 2006	Great location	Fabulous location, just off Regent Street. Reserved a Deluxe King room which was enormous and well worth the extra money for the upgrade. Bathroom was a little small but the room itself had so much room, with a large sitting area as well. Breakfast was a little pricey and just average so would suggest finding breakfast elsewhere. Would definately stay there again both for location and quality of the room. Highly recommended."
75,1338,"Jun 25 2006	Lovely Stay for 8 nights	Arrived Fri around noon- desk clerk was very friendly-they asked if we wanted smoking room or not- I said I would prefer not however my husband smokes - So the clerk gave us a non smoking room with a balcony where my husband could smoke-Great idea- they had a room ready on sixth floor 615- (only thing I didnt like at reception is they try to sell you an upgrade for 20. pds, morning paper and reserv in their restaurant (which is expensive- we didnt eat there do dont know how food is)Room was small but nicely decorated. Bed was very comfortable and they have evening turn down service. Bathroom was small but clean-Molton Brown toiletriesOne hair dryer in bathroom and one in bedroom however there is no mirror in bedroom to see how you're drying your hairConsierge was helpful with bus routes etc.breakfast was good however exactly the same each day down to identical muffins, pastries each day- 3 choices of juice, toast, rolls, sausages, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, smoked salmon. 3 kinds of cheese, all kinds of fruit and cerealIt was included in our room rate -I think 23 pnds is a lot for breakfast since when doing the conversion to$- its $46. eachwe would stay again if deal was good"
76,1338,"May 19 2006	quite okay	I still believe some folks out there are confusing this hotel with another located several blocks away. This hotel entrance is on Conduit Street just east of Bond Street. We were booked into here on a British Air Vacation package. Like most anyone reading the mixture of reviews posted, we too were a bit anxious. On arrival in late morning we were immediately given a room on the 6th floor, this is the non-smoking floor. The room was comfortable with a good size closet and a nice size double, though we found the mattress quite firm. The bath was recently renovated and spotless. The reception staff, concierge staff, doormen, bar staff, and wait staff were all professional. At busy times they did seem to be somewhat taxed but most never lost their smiles or pleasant way. We only ate breakfast at the hotel and found it okay. It is buffet style, and most just jump right in. However with the full English breakfast you may order as well. As mentioned breakfast was quite pricey. It was part of our package cost and so we found the convenience very worthwhile. Worth special mention on our visit was the maid service. We were very pleased with the cleanliness and upkeep of the room during our stay which lasted 9 days. I think the majority of guests were staying for business purposes and the lobby was filled from early morning through the day. After days spent sightseeing and nights spent out about the town we found a visit to the Polo bar a nice relaxing end to the day. Everything in the hotel and room was in proper working order. There was no construction noise during our stay. The a/c could have been cooler, perhaps that's an American thing. The mini-bar drinks weren't anymore expensive than at those found at any other hotel. If you pick up a can of beer or soda - whether you actually drink it or not - you will be charged. Just watch for room costs on your checkout invoice and if not actually used you only need to inform the cashier and they will credit your account. This was our first visit to London and we would use the Westbury Mayfair again if we return. PS - buy an Oyster card at any of the local Tube stations. We only used it inside zone 1, it's probably the best bargain in town. For about 3 pounds a day - you receive unlimited transit (bus or tube)."
77,1338,"May 16 2006 	we got great value	Having read some of the reviews of the Westbury, I was a little worried to say the least - but our stay was part of a small group booking so we had no control over the hotel which was chosen for us. However I was surprisingly delighted by the Westbury. True it is a little bland and corporate, but it was clean and our room was a decent enough size. The location was fantastic if you like to be in a main tourist area and the best thing of all was the 80 a night we were charged for the rooms. Given the location and what a rip off London can be, this provided great value for money. I realise this is not the normal rate, but if you can get a deal as good as this then you will really appreciate this hotel. Maybe not for honeymooners or people looking for something quirky or unique but I would definitly stay there again if I needed to be in the West End and just wanted a clean room for the night."
78,1338,"May 6 2006	We were satisfied	The room was as clean and tidy as one could expect in a older building. The dining area had been recently refurbished with good taste. The breakfast was good, most of the staff tried hard to please. Did not like being charged two pounds for a 30 second local telephone call - so make sure your mobile roaming function is working.The location is a definite plus.We would stay there again at the rates we were able to secure, around 186 pounds per night including breakfast for two adults and a child aged eight years.."
79,1338,"Apr 4 2006	Average	Just comeback from a weekend stay at the Westbury. We were on the 6th floor - the room was small but adequate.There was no tea making facilities in the room.Breakfast was buffet style - which was situated right by the entrance into the dining room !!On our second morning at breakfast we were given a bill ( we had prepaid ) with no price on , just a space to put a tip there! Considering we were doing all the fetching and carrying - I thought this a cheek.Hey ho, will try somehere else next time."
80,1338,"Mar 6 2006	Good location shame about the noise	This hotel is in a great location, but there are still building works going on. The hotel website obviously neglects to mention this. They started at 07.30 on saturday am! Room was fine, well decorated, a little small though."
81,1338,"Mar 6 2006	Distinctly Average	We stayed at this hotel last year and complained about the size of the room allocated to us. In response, we were offerred a free upgrade to 'one of (their) fabulous suites' if we were to return. We took them up on the offer this last weekend - and was it a job to get the upgraded booking acknowledged - they kept trying to charge the rate for a suite!The suite was far from 'fabulous'; it was merely a double-size version of the grotty little room we got on our previous visit - complete with ancient televisions,hideous old furniture, and a bathroom that looked as though it was last upgraded in the fifties. The decor including carpets and furnishings were tatty, and really only fit for the skip.The room was also noisy due to primitive double- glazing. The corridors looked like something out of a prison.Having said that, the staff, with the exception of the front-desk check-out girl, were charming and helpful - although the drink prices were ridiculously high.Another contrast to make was between the midweek (expense account) service, when the room rates were high, and the weekend service when the rates were low -gone was the turn-down service, the free newspapers and the breakfast in-room order forms. Even the room-service waiter at the weekend coudn't be bothered assembling the dining table.All in all - you can do much better in London. If a room is offerred at the Westbury for about 100 per night - take it; otherwise I'd spend a little more on a 5* or a 4* de-luxe.All the hotel really needs is about 20 million spending on it."
82,1338,"Mar 3 2006	Great service crappy room.	This hotel is quite expensive but that does not show when you consider the room. It was worn out, small, they were building something close by, so no sleep after 08.00. There was long black hairs in the bathtub (I'm blond...) The TV was small and old, The toilet was barely functioning, the airconditioning was making noises all night, no te/coffe maker and so on...But the service was great!!! And the location as well. Posh breakfast. Never again!!!!!"
83,1338,"Feb 28 2006	Was great then good now disappointing	Have stayed here on a number of occasions, mainly for location but initially because it was also a nice place to stay, how things can change! Booked two rooms specifying both late arrival and must have interconnecting doors, this was confirmed by e-mail. Arrived at 12.30am with two small children, two rooms both VERY cold, one put up bed not made up, interconnecting doors locked, both of these problems took 3 visits (ie 6 in total) by staff members to sort out. The cold rooms remained COLD. All the staff except those on daytime reception were unhelpful and had the &quot;couldnt give a damn&quot; attitude.Obviously something has changed, maybe its the management !!A great pity because location alone will not drag me back to this hotel when there is so much competition for me to choose from."
84,1338,"Feb 27 2006	Disappointing	My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights and were quite disappointed with what we got. We went for a Superior King Size, but found nothing superior about it. The worst thing was that it was very small, and not what we were expecting from a so called &quot;superior&quot; room. Neither the bed itself nor the bedding were up to 4* standard. The TV was outdated, there was no hot drinks making facilities (quite important if you want a cup of tea first thing but don't want to pay 4.95 for room service!)and no hair dryer. We overheard another customer complaining that they thought their room was like something from 50 years ago but obviously don't know what choice of room they had gone for.On the plus side, the service was good, the location is excellent and the room was quiet. The hotel foyer and bar areas have a nice glamorous feel to them and it did feel like an expensive hotel until you got out of the lift on your floor, and then on into your room.One thing maybe worth noting if you are trying to find the hotel is that the address is not Bond Street. For a start Bond Street does not exist anymore - its New Bond Street, and even that is wrong since the hotel entrance is on Conduit Street."
85,1338,"Jan 16 2006	Great central hotel	Stayed here for a weekend in January primarily for shopping and it was a fantastic location. Had a great room on the 6th floor, it is a little small, but not by London standards and perfectly adequate. Enough wardrobe and drawer space. Nice bathroom. Pleasant calming decor. Not many free channels on the TV, but if you're in London for a weekend, it would be indecent to stay in and watch TV. We didn't try the restaurant, not even for breakfast. Over 40 for a couple of croissants and a coffee seemed excessive. So we just walked down to the nearest Starbucks. Loved the Polo bar though, had quite a few drinks in there. Nice atmosphere and great service. It is expensive - 9.00 for a glass of red wine, but not much more so than most places in London. The check in and check out processes were painless, the only thing that didn't work was the newspapers we asked for on both days were not delivered to the room and even when I asked at the concierge, they didn't have them, so must have given them to someone else. A pleasant stay in a great location. Would recommend it."
86,1338,Dec 12 2005	Nice Hotel	Stayed for a weekend break with my in laws - good service and excellent breakfast. No tea or coffee in the rooms which was the only fault - would stay again!
87,1338,"Nov 19 2005	Fab Location	I just spent a couple of nights here, great rate with BA including breakfast and tax etc. for 225 euro/night.The lobby/lounge is newly redone and very smart with staff to open doors take luggage etc. Most staff encountered were charming and helpfull.The bedroom was small with a double bed ,desk 2 armchairs,table and minibar all cmammed in, making it a bit difficult to move around. Bathroom was also small and newly refurbished apart from the taps which had lost their plating,nice Molton Brown toiletries, big fluffy towels. Both bedroom an bathroom were very clean. Breakfast the first day was very slow in coffee service and if not in room rate not worth 23. Next day was better but still not worth the price.Locationwise it is great with Regent st 2 mins away and hald way up Bond st. So shoppers heaven and easy and pleasant walk to Green park etc. If you don't want to eat and drink in hotel, there is Sketch over the road for a decent continenal breakfast at half the price. Berkely sq. is also close and everything from a Pret to 2* restaurant.By Bongoblog"
88,1338,"Oct 24 2005	Deserves it 4 stars.	The Westbury was in an excellent location, for both shopping and the West End/Covent Garden. We walked to the West End in only 15mins, so definitely closer than you might think (if you are a tube traveller!). The hotel was very welcoming, with excellent service and a 1st class breakfast. One gripe was the lack of tea and coffee facilities in the rooms and they were quite small (basic twin). I would defo recommend it and may well be back in the near future!"
89,1338,"Sep 16 2005	Not happy	I booked via a travel agent this hotel after checking the information I was given and comparing it with the hotel's own website. When I got to the hotel I realized it was under renovation and the services were serverly compromised. There was work going on in the public areas like the bar and the restaurant and lobby. Not to mention scaffolding outside and we having to use a side entrance to enter the premises. I asked why was this vital fact not informed to me and to my agent, or why was it not mentioned in the website. I was told that it was because; in their opinion these renovations were not going to affect my stay !!!???I felt as I had been lied to on a vital issue, and then treated arrogantly. In my opinion it is up to me to decide if renovations negatively affect my stay or not. I cannot trust the information on the website to be true now or in the future. This managment has a company policy where lying is institutionalized."
90,1338,"Sep 15 2005 	Stay elsewhere!	I can't believe I'm writing this review after staying at the Westbury during every trip to London for the past 3 years, but here goes. I arrived and found the lobby was under construction and a bit of a mess. I was disappointed, and made a mental note to ask my client to meet me out at a restaurant instead of the hotel lobby. When I went to check in, the desk clerk could not find my records in the computer and needed me to fill out my passport and contact info again. I asked her to check the computer again since I am a regular customer she gave me a little bit of attitude. When I finally got into my room I looked around and realized it was a bit &quot;shabby&quot; and found the bathroom wasn't so clean (dust - nothing disgusting). I figured I would deal with it in the morning and got ready for bed. Once in the bed I realized I could hear the man in the room next door snoring (thin walls), but figured I would be fine since I was exhausted. At 4am I was woken up by a terrible banging noise that would not stop. After 10 minutes I finally called the front desk and asked them to come investigate, which they did immediately. It turns out there was air in the pipes and nothing they could do about it. I asked to have my room changed immediately and after a tiny argument I was shown to a room on the opposite side of the hotel (larger with updated decor). The next evening my client called to advise our dinner plans and was transferred to my old room. Although surprised I wasn't available at 7pm as we had previously agreed, she left me a voice mail with instructions on the time and place. Unfortunately, this message did not reach me until 10:30pm - well after I was due to meet her. This caused an embarrasing situation, and was the last straw. There are nicer hotels with better service in London. Stay at one of them - I know I will on my next trip!"
91,1338,"Sep 14 2005	Shame about the breakfast	We stayed for three nights. The location is good for shopping and the staff were all very pleasant and friendly. However it's undergoing a renovation at present which leaves the lobby looking very ordinary.The room was good, but tiny. In fact I began to wonder if we had been given a single room, as there was only one bathrobe, but the booking was clearly for a double, and there were two of everything else. Well furnished and clean, with good airconditioning.But to have to stand in a queue for 15 minutes to get into the breakfast room is ridiculous for a four star hotel! Maybe this was something to do with the renovation works, but I couldn't see where else we could have gone. The breakfast itself was good, when we finally got to it."
92,1338,"Aug 16 2005	Clean average hotel but great location	Just returned from a 2 night break here. There was building work going on around reception but not enough to bother us. The whole place was very clean but a little dated and the rooms were very small, if I had paid full price for this (260 ish a night ) I would have complained. The polo bar again is clean and nice but old fashioned (was expecting the decor to be more up to date than it was ) we were charged 22.50 for 2 bloody mary's which gives you an idea of prices they charge in the hotel !! On the whole the hotel was very average and I guess the prices they charge is reflected in the location, just a 5 mins walk from Oxford Circus station and central to pretty much everything e.g Selfridges, Regent Street, Leicester Square, China town, Soho and Covent Garden. I think I will be trying somewhere else to stay next time I'm in London but if I was stuck I probably would go back if I got a good deal, ( I paid 99 per night for the room )."
93,1338,"Aug 7 2005	Good Location worth Staying if you get a good deal	When we arrived at the hotel there was building work going off in the reception area and half of it was shut off! (this did not bother us too much but it would have been polite to have advised us of this at time of booking).We went up to the room, which was clean but small. My opinion was that the rooms needed some refurbishment.Overall the hotel was fine and in a perfect location! The hotel bar was a little quite (we prefer a buzzing bar) but the breakfast was lovely. We got a good deal on the hotel and paid 115 for the room,vat and continental breakfast. I would stay at this hotel again but only at this price. there are better hotels about for the figure of 140 + (which most websites charge this hotel at)"
94,1338,"Jul 6 2005	Love London Love the Westbury Mayfair	My husband and I spent 7 nights at the Westbury and left with no complaints. The location was Excellent, staff friendly, the hotel itself was clean and the room was larger than expected for a city hotel (I had prepared myself for a tiny little cave based on some of the reviews). The doormen &amp; conceirge are top notch - going out of their way to be friendly and helpful. As the other reviews indicated, make sure your breakfast is included - it is very convenient and quick as it is a buffet.This is definitely a great hotel for tourists who want to take advantage of all London has to offer. In that regard, seek out the assistance of the conceirge. These gentlemen take care of everything and would not accept tips (we typically don't stay at hotels w/ a conceirge so we didn't realize that tipping was not appropriate until after we tried to - it was politely refused). I also noticed many art &amp; antique dealers there. The shopping in the immediate vicinity is high end, but you are in walking distance from tons of shops, pubs, restaurants, picadilly, soho, etc. too.My only complaint is that is was 90 degrees and sunny every day - - not the London weather we expected :) I came back from London tanner than some friends that went to the caribbean!"
95,1338,"Jun 28 2005	Can't beat the location and should be in the top 50 at least	Just off Regent St and great for shopping and the theatre. Just returned from a 1 night Sat break and was impressed. The Westbury is a privately run hotel that is undergoing some refurbishment but makes a real effort to keep the standards up (more 4* than 5* though). There are some great deals out there (paid 110 inc free breakfastx2) so you can forgive the poorly trained restaurant staff but the doorman more than makes up for it and looks after you well. Rooms are fine, very clean, nice soaps and stuff and didn't feel cramped at all. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for its great location, price at the weekend and free breakfast if you can get it (I wouldn't pay 22pp!)."
96,1338,"May 12 2005	Good location for serious shoppers	This pleasant hotel is just off Bond Street, and a couple of streets away from the Burlington Arcade - ideally located for very expensive shopping. The staff are pleasant and the public rooms ok. We stayed in a &quot;Superior King&quot; room, which was neutrally decorated and a decent size, though the bathroom is quite small.It is a perfectly pleasant place to stay, but you are paying a premium for location: it doesn't have much atmosphere, and if I had had to pay the rack rate (about 240 per night) I would have gone somewhere like Hazlitt's or the Covent Garden hotel. For 140 from lastminute, I thought it was reasonable value."
97,1338,"Mar 30 2005	Nice hotel	Just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel (24-28 March 2005)The hotel is good. But since the price is high, I must complaint about having to wait in the lobby to be seated for breakfast - 3/4 mornings had to wait. Maybe the easter holiday is to blame. I really couldn't care less. The hotel should be prepared to receive tourists and the breakfast room is just too small. Not enough tables for the size of the hotel. And i have had better breakfasts in cheaper hotels.The hotel staff is very polite. Yet, they'd better get some help during breakfast time, because sometimes it seemed they couldn't handle it and, again, had to wait for a while for toasts or just milk.The rooms aren't large, but they're ok. Everything is clean and the carefully put. The decor is old fashion, but ok.The hotel location is good, 5 to 10 minute walk to Picadilly. Although you can walk to Picadilly, it'd be much nicer to have the subway/underground closer."
98,1338,"Mar 10 2005	An impressive 4* hotel!	Walking through the hotel entrance towards the reception desk, we were very impressed with what greeted us. There is no question that this is a 4* deluxe as advertised.Unfortunately, at check in, there was no booking for us (through no fault of the hotel) but the efficient reception and reservation staff was very quick to put this right for us. We were also upgraded from a Supreme Queen to &quot;a bigger room with a bigger bed&quot;!On entering our room we were very surprised at just how small this &quot;bigger&quot; room was...I'd hate to imagine the size of the Supreme Queen. That said, everything in the room was of an excellent standard. Carpets, wallpaper and other fixtures and fittings were all in immaculate condition. (This high standard was also visible in the hotel corridors.)As far as noise levels go, we didn't have any real problems at The Westbury. Traffic noise was minimal (great considering it's central location) and on occasions we could hear the sound of the next room's TV, but this was never later than 10pm.In summery, if you are looking for a high quality hotel with a very central location (Oxford Street and Regent Street just minutes walk away) you can't go far wrong with The Westbury. The only thing we would have liked to have seen was a slightly bigger room for our money."
99,1338,"Feb 19 2005	great location but small rooms	Stayed here on business on a a thursday night in Feb 2005. Location is fantastic, less than a minute to the expensive attractions of bond street, the royal academy, regent' s street (Liberty's) picadilly and St. James. Got a great rate but a small room - beware if room size is important to you then do not book a superior queen. However the room was very comfortable, nicely decorated and the bathroom whilst very small had everthing a girl could want. I was travelling alone so the size of the room was OK but it would have been cramped for 2. The location is fantastic and very safe for a lone female traveller. The staff are all really nice and remember you by name - quite an acheivement in London. The main downside is that the lobby is quite small and can get very busy - and very very smokey. At times the level of smoke in the lobby was unpleasant and you have to walk through it to get to the elevators. Room service was good &amp; fast, breakfast was Ok, but if it not included in the rate would be very expensive at 20. better to walk 5 minutes to picadilly and go the the starbucks or Pret. Beware this area is quiet after dark so you may want another location if you are after nightlife - theatre district is aout a 15 minute cab ride."

1,1346,Apr 29 2009	Quiet and Comfortable	The hotel was pleasant and ran by friendly and helpful staff. The room was smaller than expected but still comfortable. There was a good selection for breakfast.It has a close proximity to Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts.I would recommend this hotel.
2,1346,"Nov 29 2007 	We loved the White Lodge Hotel	This lovely guest house/bed and breakfast was home to us this year during our week-long, bi-annual trip to London. It was clean, easily accessible from the Underground by a short bus ride, reasonably priced, and the staff and management were extremely friendly and accommodating. While we were there, they were offering free broadband, which I was able to access from the common area of the hotel. Continental breakfast was available. Will we return? Absolutely!"
3,1346,"Dec 11 2006 	Avoid!!!!	Never seen anything like it.... At first it seemed like a basic but clean guest house, and the girls working there seemed nice. Well, i didn't have a clue what was next! Arrived late at night, at about 2 in the morning. The room was very basic but clean so i said, well, is not as bad as it could be, but when i decided to have a nice hot shower after being travelling all day to my surprise there was not hot water! at first i thought maybe there was some kind of problem that could be easily resolved in the morning so i had a 'very' quick shower with freezing cold water and decided to have a chat with them in the morning. When i got up, after 11am, checked the water and was still cold, so i went to the girl in charge to explain the problem. To my surprise she said that they only had water until 11, and after that i had to let them know 15 min before if i wanted to have a shower so they could switch on the boiler!!! Can you believe that!!? Anyway, i thought, ok next time i will call them ant let them know. That night arrived at about 11pm and decided to have a shower as it was a very cold night and been walking around london all day. Tried to call the girls and no one was there, so AGAIN had to have a cold shower. So i decided in the morning i would have another chat and tell them that this wasn't acceptable. And the cold water was not the only problem they call you at 8am!! yes 8 am to ask you if you want your room done. And not only once, noooo, 3 times they called me, hour after hour!! And let me tell you, is the noisiest hotel i've ever been, banging on doors all morning, terrible. So for me, that was enough. i lost my patience and said that i would not take this anymore. They either switch the boiler all day or i was leaving. the girl said she couldn't do that so i decided to leave early and requested a reduction on the 2 nights i stayed without hot water. Spoke to the owner of the hotel and let me tell you, that woman has never heard about Customer Service. She even wanted me to pay for the rest of the days as she claimed it was 72h cancelation notice!! well, well.... she would not believe i was actually 2 days in a row with no hot water, she said that no one ever complained about it and it was her who actually had a go at me!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! anyway she started to scream like a lunatic, she would not listen to me and would not understand that i had my rights as a customer. At the end decided to pay her the FULL PRICE for the 2 nights I stayed as i there was no way to make her come to her senses. Honestly, If anyone is thinking of going there, please, AVOID IT!!!"
1,1350,Avoid roomservice food	Decent rooms. However do avoid room service. It was sent cold with stale bread.
2,1350,"Oct 1 2009 	Wonderful retreat in the middle of it all	The Windmill is located on Clapham Common, adjacent to a pub. Clapham is a wonderful residential area of southwest London. It is easily accessible by tube and bus and is chock-a-block full of young families with kids, dogs, soccer players, bike riders etc. There are many good restaurants, shops, pubs etc. Our room, a premium one, was extrarodinarily large and beautifully decorated in a clean, modern style. The breakfast, included, was nice with great pastries and full-cooked was an option. The common is huge and a great place to take a walk and enjoy the London that those who live there are fortunate to have. A bargain at around 150 BPS."
3,1350,"Sep 27 2009 	This hotel is in a great spot very nice rooms a great atmosphere in the bar and yet the rooms are surprisingly quiet	I have now stayed in this hotel on two seperate occassions. The staff are very friendly, the food is very good and the locations is great,especially in the summer months when there are lots of things happening on the common. The breakfasts are excellent and I will definetly stay here again."
4,1350,"Sep 22 2009 	Would not stay here again	I traveled to London with an American friend. For both, first trip to the U.K. Once we found our way to Clapham Common from Heathrow (first to Paddington Station, then via Tube to Clapham), we were tired from a redeye flight. We stayed in a premium room, more expensive than the standard room. Beds were comfortable, though I prefer a firmer mattress. The room was large enough, with decent wicker furniture, TV, coffeemaker, fridge. Very small closet (inadequate for two sets of clothing). Bathroom had no ventilation; when showering, the mirrors steamed up, so opening up a window was necessary (and it gets chilly in London!). Pub restaurant served tasty complimentary breakfast for guests and decent pub fare for dinner. Negatives: housekeeping did not provide new bath towels unless you requested them. Front desk staff was not knowledgable about London attractions (seems as if most of them just started working there). No quiet common areas for guests to sit outside of one's room, other than the pub itself. And, no wash cloths, and only one tiny bar of soap for the entire week! (We bought our own soap at the nearby Boots drugstore chain). Thankfully, we did not spend much time at the hotel, as there is so much to see and do in London. Overall, a disappointment, given that this was a &quot;premium&quot; room."
5,1350,Jul 5 2009 	Loved it!	Stayed there night before London to Brighton Bike Ride - great location for this event. Nice rooms. Staff helpful. Will look forward to staying there again for next year's bike ride
6,1350,Jun 8 2009 	Nice hotel for a good price	I stayed here May 29th and 30th for a wedding. I traveled from the U.S. The hotel is a charming Inn with an attached pub. The rooms are quiant and comfortable. It has close access to bus and tube stations. It also is directly next to a large park. The pub can get a little noisy but you can't hear it from your room. Staff was helpful and friendly. If you have an event here on a weekend be prepared to have random people from the pub walking through your event and long ques for the washroom...unless you're lucky enough to also have your room there.
7,1350,"Dec 24 2008 	A gem of a hotel	This hotel is on Clapham Common and has parking available for hotel guests at no extra charge. Our room was contemporary and had everything we needed (no minibar though). The bathroom was very modern, the bed comfortable and the inclusive breakfast was very good. It is part of a pub but we heard no noise late in the evening. The pub itself is lovely, big leather sofas, loads of seating and a really welcoming bar area.I would use this hotel again without hesitation."
8,1350,"Dec 12 2008 	Great for much needed R	Travelling on business but combining seeing friends is sometimes tricky, as many hotels in residential areas can be questionable. The Windmill on the Common is not - its a great place.The building itself is a big old brick building, with solid, warmth retaining and sound preventing walls. The rooms (I stayed in a superior) are modern and well appointed, tastefully decorated and impeccably clean and tidy. Bathrooms have slate style floors and mine was spotless - even the corners of the bath were free from tell tale little black mold marks, something rare to see in British hotels.The breakfast was excellent - proper full english, well prepared. The staff were polite, cheerful and helpful throughout. Food in the pub was good - well prepared gastro pub stuff.The location is idle, on the common, a bit away from the road and associated noise. I certainly didn't hear any noise form the pub in the same building (I was midweek). Its great if you want to go for a run in the evening, or any of the other activities on the common (British Miliatry Finess for instance).Overall, this represent excellent value. For 11o or 140, you're getting a top quality stay, and its only 25 mins on the tube to the city."
9,1350,Oct 2 2008 	rude staff	i stayed for 2 nights i found that the rooms were great but the food was the worst i ever tasted the staff were rude and the head chef named ian was the worst of all plus the manager was arrogant however i do reccomend the hotel stay clear of the resturant
10,1350,"Sep 14 2008 	loved the decor	Stayed here as part of a large group for a family wedding.Thought the bar area was lovely - modern/unusual decor. We had a family room which was fine - the bathroom was to a very high standard.We ate an evening meal and a lunch in the hotel - both were good. We had two breakfasts - one was excellent, then the 2nd was shocking - obviously a different chef who just didn't care - we ordered the same things as the previous day and the difference in presentation and effort was huge - sent some of it back.The hotel is just that bit too far to be considered walking distance from the tube, which is a shame as it is a good price for London and has more character than the chain hotels.It is situated right on Clapham Common, which is ideal for walking off all the food!"
11,1350,"Aug 11 2008 	A little pricey but pretty good	Stayed here last night and was favourably impressed. The reception and corridors looked a bit tired and I was fearing the worst but our room, a superior double, was well appointed and stylishly decorated. The bed was large and comfy and the bathroom, while fairly petite, was modern and spotless. Breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was fair if not outstanding. The price for the room was at the high end of reasonable but fair enough given the quality and location but beware of drinking in the bar which is actually just a pub, albeit rather a good one. 16 for a large and a small glass of fairly OK Pouilly Fume isn't unacceptable but 9 for a pint and a single g&amp;t is verging on insulting."
12,1350,"May 8 2008 	great London value	If you are looking for clean, comfortable , spacious and reasonably priced accommodation in London, The Windmill has got to be on your list. The Windmill is a popular pub on Clapham Common, a wonderful big green space close to Central London. The tube station is 4 minutes walk away, and buses stop close by, or if you have a car, there is a special car park on site. The high street has many good eating places and pubs. Rooms are on 3 floors at the rear of the building, which means noise from the pub is not a problem. Rooms appear newly renovated (we stayed here on 2 occasions in different rooms) and are quite spacious with an armchair and writing desk . Like most hotel rooms in Europe, they are well heated, but if too hot, there is air-conditioning to override it. Breakfast is generous and served in the large conservatory eating area inside the pub. The staff (who seemed to be nearly all Australian) were helpful and if you stay a weekend, you get a special reduced tariff. We loved this hotel!"
13,1350,"Mar 18 2008 	Average and clean but expensive	The Windmill is a long established pub which sits alongside just a few houses in the middle of Clapham common. The position is something of a feature which sits roughly midway between Clapham Common and Clapham South tube stations each of which are around 500m away. Im guessing that around 15yrs ago, someone had the bright idea of building a three storey extension at the side which is where all the accommodation is located.The rooms are clean, have good bathrooms, TV and tea and coffee etc, with all meals being taken in the pub itself. I only had one breakfast there which was more than adequate although the stale smell of the pub from the night before was noticeable. My thoughts are that the whole set up is in my view little different to a Travel Inn or similar. From my perspective the only difference between the two is the fact that the prices here start at 110 for bed and breakfast and I believe that you can get the same for much less, or something significantly better for only a little more expenditure elsewhere.No real complaints but I feel that this place is only in the region of the 60 - 80 per night bracket and is therefore presently overpriced."
14,1350,"Sep 13 2007 	just the best	WE stayed here for four nights in September, it was just fantastic and made our stay in London. The room and ensuite were vvery good the bed comfortable and the towels and toiletries changed every day. There is both bar and restaurant food also very good and breakfast either continental or full english is included. The staff were all excellent,cheerful and nothing was to much trouble. It is only five minutes walk from two tube stations and the same from several restaurants and supermarkets. They gave us a late checkout and we could also have left our bags longer."
15,1350,"May 8 2007 	What a Disappointment	This place was as expected for a 3 star 'Youngs' establishment so no shocks there. We had just got married so we arrived in the early hours and just needed the room for a night as our relatives were in our house. We overslept and arrived at breakfast at 5 past 10 and were told the kitchen was now closed for breakfast. Fair enough, we were 5 minutes late after all, but there was absolutely no allowances made for the married couple. We tried to reason and the only response from the waitress was a flash of her wedding band in a 'So What' manner. Right on cue 2 cooked breakfasts wafted past that had obviously been done at 5 to ten. The excuse being was that they were now getting ready for Lunch (do me a favour - it was five past Ten).Anyway as shocked as I was that they couldn't go the extra distance for the married couple we went to pack and return the mile and a half home. Only to find we couldn't wash because the could tap in room 304 doesn't work and on the way out to put a cherry on top there were 2 chefs enjoying a ciggy break in the waste area. (Clearly rushed off their feet).If you want a classic 'Youngs' approach to hospitality, heres where to find it - Woeful for 100 for 8 hours sleep in a cigarette smelling room with no cold tap in the bathroom."
16,1350,"Mar 23 2007 	They saved us!	What a weekend!!! We were victims of the fire that disrupted the Eurostar service on March 16 and the hotel (guesthouse) that we had booked was evacuated. So, we were homeless and didn't know the zone at all. Someone recommended us to check out the Windmill Pub on Common.Wow, what a place, I loved the concept...it is a Pub + Restaurant + Hotel and they don't get mixed at all. You have people drinking and listening to semi loud music at the pub but still the people at the restaurant are having a nice meal and you at the hotel can relax without listening to a thing! Nice! True, the price is a bit high (100 pounds) but they have specials and you can get two nights for 160 pounds, not bad at London. Our old place wanted 65 pounds and that was without a private bathroom!The rooms are pretty well decorated though you can tell they are getting old. TV works fine, you get the normal channels, automatic heater/AC and obviously coffee/tea in the room. The bathroom was the part we liked the most.. The tub was huge, I am 5'7 and could almost submerge my whole body. Toiletries were provided. The bed was fine, I particularly liked it compared to other hotels. The only kind of annoyance was that the wooden boards creaked when you walked on them. Breakfast was included in the price and is not your regular corn flakes/muffins breakfast. They will cook eggs, sausage and other traditional English items for breakfast. We would have stayed another night but they were fully booked. Still, Caroline at the front desk was kind enough to phone at least 15 hotels to find us a room for that night. I would recommend this place to anyone who can afford it. It is close to Clapham Junction which takes you into Central London. Clapham is south of London."
17,1350,"Jun 1 2006 	average and expensive	overpriced for overheated rooms with Eastern European service, but still the best hotel in Clapham you can get."
1,1352,"Apr 27 2007 	Good Location Lousy Apartment	The location is very good with close proximity to 2 Tube lines. Flat # 6 is very run down with dirty carpets and blown bulbs, broken shower screen etc Don't bother contacting Woogoo's Customer Care Manager. He or she does not respond to comments."
2,1352,"Mar 15 2007 	Pleasant stay but with some minuses	When arriving in the dark it was impossible to see the phone by the door. Luckilly we met someone and they told us to dial 0 and showed us the phone. Our papers said a different phone number. Once we got the entrance code we could not see the numbers on the security box. (We are not so young 50 - 75). But once in it all was good except following:There was no bedside lamp. Why?? So if you read at night you had to get up to turn of the light. And the carpet on the lower floor was dirty. But other than that - good value for money and clean. We missed a storage room to put the luggage day of departure. Spacious rooms, small bathroom. Very good kitchen - also with washer. Elisabeth, Oslo, Norway March 07."
3,1352,"Jan 16 2007	Trouble to get in but once in we loved it	Having read the reviews after the apartment had been booked, we arrived with some trepidation. We did have trouble getting the security number using the phone number on the website. Eventually, after many phone calls and some misunderstanding on their part we got the number and was informed we had been upgraded to the three bedroom apartment.Once in, we were more than pleasantly surprised. Apart from the cream carpet having a few grubby marks, the rooms were very clean, spacious, well decorated with everything we needed. Unfortunately, we were only stopping one night so didn't get to enjoy it as much as we would have liked.Around the corner are many places to eat, an excellent Spar and Tesco's and Hyde Park just up the road.Apart from the early trouble of getting the security code (apparently the firm is based in Israel) we couldn't fault the three bedroom apartment."
4,1352,"Nov 22 2006 	a very bad experience	I booked this place direct on the recommendation of a colleague as a quality inexpensive central safe place to stay in London.For GBP99/night Woogo confirmed in writing that I had been upgraded from a studio to a 1bdr apartment. On arrival I used the phone at the entrance and was connected to what I now realise was a call centre somewhere in the world (Mexico?) and the people had no idea of the location or what the property was like. After being told to enter the building and pick up the keys - I couldnt find the apartment. there was no #1. Eventually I found a resident who directed me outside the building and down into the basement where I found a 1 room apartment (studio) heated to about 30 degrees C. On checking out the appliances the bottom of the kitchen module fell off. Also, despite promises in writing by Woogo there was no phone. I called the call centre who said I needed to speak to the building manager but it was his day off. 24 hours later someone came while I was out and re attached the bottom of the kitchen however this meant that the dishwasher could not be opened but I already ascertained that there was no power to it anyway. There was still no phone, and the only picture on the various tv channels was snow. By this stage I had called the call centre maybe 6 times and in all cases they referred me to the building manager who in the 3 days I was there made no attempt to contact me or rectify anything. Eventually I emailed Woogo and gave them 24 hours to rectify the problems - no response. I have now moved to a hotel which is clean comfortable and safe (pity about the roaches and the rising damp at Woogo Bayswater). Another matter arose which made me feel quite unsafe however I gather this cannot be posted on this site.I would not recommend Woogo Bayswater to anyone."
5,1352,"Nov 3 2006	Worst service i've ever encounter	Bad service.....call up the person in charge and he told us that we had to wait till 3 pm in order to check in. When we asked more info regarding getting the key...he just replied unpatiently and said &quot;sir please get there and then call again&quot;. Everything had to be done in his way or no way. Then when we got there, call him again and unpatienly he just told us how to press the code and get the keys. The apartment is really run down, no person will attend to you if there is anything wrong. During our stay, some drunk fellow just sat outside our unit. What an unsafe place to be in."
6,1352,"Oct 31 2006 	worst company ever	A company representative called us at 3.15 pm - 15 minutes after we could have checked in - saying that we had to be relocated due to unforseen maintenance problems. We were originally booked at Kensington Palace, with 5 stars (now I doubt this too) and the guy said that we would be upgraded to Bayswater. The stress of the situation was awful, not knowing London or where the new apartment was wasted a lot of time. When we arrived at the apartment I was so upset. It was a dingy basement bedsit, with dirty sheets and a dirty bathroom. AVOID THIS COMPANY THEY ARE SCAMMERS!!! The staff were all totally unresponsive and blunt, and the whole experience was dreadful."
7,1352,"Jul 23 2006 	Very disappointing	This was a very disappointing experience. We were told upon arrival on the phone to go to the apartment and someone would be there with our keys to let us in. We took our 4 children and all our luggage only to find that no one was there and we had to take a tube ride to retrieve the keys-it took incredibly long to finally figure this out, with three phone calls and 3 staff each telling us something different. The apartment was marginally cleaned-old earring on the floor, very stained (disgustingly so) pillows and duvet, towels inadequately sized. The kitchen had no basics-not even paper towels or salt! The bathrooms had one roll of toilet paper!! Very unusable for a family. The microwave and clothing dryer were broken and after calling they never got fixed-left with a pile of dirty laundry. Unable to talk to a person when I called customer service-no one was there! It was so bad it was almost funny."
8,1352,"Jun 18 2006	not as expected very disapointing.	after reading your feedback on accomodation in bayswater (17- inverness terrace) we were reluctant to go! we thought it cant be that bad surely! we are back now after a weekend away. the accomodation as previous customers had pointed out lived up to the reviews. 1- the 3 bedroom apt- sleeps up to 8 people! two seperate rooms with double beds. one with ensuite. the third bedroom leads from the lounge gaining access from a spiral staircase. a double bed is located here, with no privacy. 2 fold down beds in lounge, not clean.- very tatty. 2- when we arrived we were very disapointed. the accomodation does not meet up to the standards that are advertised. the pictures of the luxurious bedrooms we never saw. the place needed a good clean and also a lick of paint. 3- for the money we paid, we expected a lot more. VERY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMERS!!!!!!"
9,1352,"May 15 2006	Great deal for a flat through Woogo [...]	We recently spent 4 nights in London and I rented a flat through [...], I got an early booking discount since we reserved it about 6 months in advance. We paid only 300 pounds for 4 nights and had a studio flat. The flat was in the Bayswater area at 17 Inverness terr, it is a 2 level flat, very small. The first floor is a kitchen, a spiral staircase to the second floor which is a bedroom and bath. I was able to pick up a wireless internet connection within the flat which was nice. The kitchen was minimally equipped but enough for our breakfasts, there was a stove, fridge and microwave. The washer and dryer worked fine. The location was great as it's about a block from the Tube and the area was quiet and nice. This was cheaper then most of the hotel prices I found online and the accomodations were very comfortable."
10,1352,"Jan 11 2006	Bait 	Upon return from our vacation I did a web search and learned that Woogo is nothing more than a rebranded Yourstay. And Yourstay lodging has a notorious reputation for the mistreatment of lodgers.Enjoy Woogo with the following expectations:(1) Rooms not as advertised. Two bedroom means that someone gets to sleep on a mattress in the living area.(2) Fully kitted kitchen is not. A few plates, and some flatware, applicances which do not function. A stove with three of the four burners inoperative. A microwave oven which does not work. (3) If you want a clean unit, then do you own cleaning upon you arrival.(4) The location of the flat will not be as advertised. After you arrive you will discover that your quoted and guaranteed rental is 'currently unavailable'.(5) Marginal locations suggest that you consider not leaving the premises at night.(6) Company representatives on the phone will gladly treate you like dirt after they have your money. They are not responsible for any problem with your lodging and never offer refunds for their commission of fraud."

2,1361,"Aug 12 2009 	Great Location Clean Rooms Good Value	I stayed at the YWCA Hotel Montreal. (They run a hostel too). It's got a great location for visiting Downtown Montreal, and even Vieux Montreal, if you don't mind the walk (almost 30 min, but lots of sights). You can walk to a variety of different restaurants at night. The rooms are clean and basic, and service is good. There is a restaurant in the lobby (breakfast is not included). The rates are fantastic for a big city--and the proceeds support YWCA programs, so that is a nice bonus. It's a quiet hotel and they have lots of tourist information and can help with anything you ask. The restaurant for breakfast is okay. Oh, if you stay out past 11, they lock the doors and you have to ring a bell to get in, FYI. Great stay on a budget, in the heart of the city."
3,1361,"Sep 27 2008 	Good value	We stayed in this hotel in Montreal for one night. We had one of the cheap rooms with shared bathroom. The room was clean with a TV and air conditioning. It was comfortable but not attractive. We were happy with the room for the price. The one real problem is with the bathroom and shower facilities. There's no problem with this as far as the ladies are concerned, but for men things are much more grim. The men's bathroom is dark and dirty, and you should be prepared to wait for your turn almost every time you visit. The shower room is a little better, but it too gets messy quickly. Here's my top tip: if you get fed up with waiting for the bathroom (and, eventually, you will), there's another one on the ground floor. It's the only additional one I could find. Or even better: pay a little more and go for a room with a private bathroom! Or even better than that: forget about staying in a hotel and book into one of the many good B&amp;Bs in Montreal for the same price!"
4,1361,"May 10 2007	Exceeds my expectation	I stayed a couple of days in Hilton, Quebec City for business prior to traveling to Montreal. This was a side trip and I didn't want to spend too much money, so I booked the Y hotel with not much expectation since I paid about $60 per night only. It turned out to be a pleasant experience. The facility is old and cannot be compared to Hilton but the room is almost as spacious as the 4 star hotel I stayed previously. The kitchen facility is a great bonus even though I didn't really use it. My guest visitors were also very impressed when they came to visit me."
5,1361,"Jan 13 2007	Great budget hotel	I stayed at the Montreal Y hotel when I went to a conference in Monteal in June of 2006. I highly recommend this place to travellers who look for an inexpensive and decent place to stay. (I showed my student ID to the cashier, and got 10% off!) In general, the area is pretty safe. The location is central, close to tons of restaurants, bars, and shops. There's a metro stop a few blocks away. The room that I stayed had a private bath. It looks like that the hotel is recently rennovated. Everything looks new! Both the room and the bathroom were very cean and comfortable. (The room was very quie?.) There's a TV set in the room. Also an ice machine down the hall way. There are a microwave, pots, and pans in their kitchen (there's a supermarket just blocks away), where you could prepare your meals. The kitchen is clean and has lots of sun light. (Also free use of the YMCA gym)The only downside is that there's no wireless internet access inside the hotel."
1,1362,Nov 13 2009 	Great Location	I stayed here 3 nights on a personal visit. I booked it through Expedia. I paid AU$545.05 including taxes for the 3 nights. The location was exactly where I wanted to be which is the main reason I chose it. The entrance is a bit odd. From the street you go though doors and down half a flight of stairs. What you see from the street is a hair dressing salon. The entrance to the hotel lobby is to the right of the salon. The lobby is incrediably tacky
2,1362,"Oct 18 2009 	Don't even waist your money	ya the rooms are small I went with my husband and son the beds were comfortable but the service ahhh no ... you know what don't even waist your time at the time of check in we requested a queen size bed they didn't have it available we made the reservation a few days ago, so they gave us another room at no extra charge, but they wanted a $20 deposit incase you rent a movie... anyway yes the bathroom is small and they had running hot water, but when it was time to check out the receptionist said ya you get your $20.00 back they put it back in your account so my husband called the credit card company to see if they put back the money ... the receptionist lied so my husband went back and had to complain the receptionist gave us the run-around so on top of that they gave us the money back in cash... and the parking lot was across the street from the hotel ... so if i were you don't bother going to this hotel i hope you make the smart decision"

If you are planning to get out and keep busy seeing the sights, this hotel is great. If you want a large luxurious room to spend a bunch of time in, you might want to choose another hotel.&gt;Rooms are very, very small. Not only the actual room but the bathroom is tiny as well. Relatively clean, although while we were getting ready to check out we found an old black banana peel. Elevators are also small. No issue with noise, we found the rooms to be quiet. &gt;Staff is polite, helpful when asked.&gt;Restaurant in lobby, Chez Cora serves breakfast and was good, but long lineups on weekends. As noted above, lots of restaurants within walking distance to choose from as well.For us, the price was reasonable and the location was superb. We don't spend a whole lot of time in the room on trips, so we would consider staying here again next time we visit. Metro station is also close by, so getting elsewhere in the city (Old Montreal, ect.) is very simple."
4,1362,"Sep 5 2009 	Tiny rooms tinier washrooms horrible service	I am not sure why this hotel has good reviews.Small smelly rooms. Tinier washroom. Horrible service.We checked into the hotel because I have stayed at other Best Western hotels and this is nothing like them. Compared to this Best Western, the other Best Western hotels were luxury hotels!!I am writing this review from the hotel room.Our room was so small only one of us could move in the little space between our bed and the TV.The washroom was so tiny that you would have to sit on the edge of the pot so that your knees don't bang against the wall.The exhaust in the washroom gave both of us a terrible headache. The washroom did not have sufficient toiletries for 2 people so I called the front desk. It took me more than 1 hour to have 1 extra towel, soap and shampoo sent up to the room. Basically - a very disappointing experience. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone."
5,1362,"Aug 27 2009 	Clean hotel good value	My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Ups: Clean, comfortable hotel. Good location, and close to both the green and orange subway lines. Great value!Downs: The location is convenient but we ended up trekking to other neighborhoods most of the time. The service is disappointing - staff was either unfriendly or inexperienced. Our single King room was right by the elevator and I heard all the people walking by. Maid service came at an alarming 830AM, waking us up way too early.Even with all the downsides, the hotel is a great value."
6,1362,"Aug 19 2009 	Great Location 	It's very true - the rooms are TINY. But they are clean, the shower has lots of hot water and it's 1/2 the rate of any other hotel downtown! So if you are enjoying Montreal and just in the room to sleep, you won't mind the small rooms.The location alone is fantastic right next to shops on St. Catharines St and a couple blocks away from the pubs on Crescent. Also only a 15min walk from old Montreal."
7,1362,"Jul 27 2009 	Good Location Run Down Hotel	We stayed at the Best Western Europa hotel on Drummond Street July 21-24, 2009. The hotel was in a great location right in the centre of everything. It was within walking distance to the Metro station, shopping and tourist attractions. The staff at the hotel went to great lengths to assist us in whatever we needed.My problem was with the room. We stayed in 412 and let me tell you, this room was very basic. The carpet is worn out and looks dirty. The air conditioner was really loud and every time the compresser went on and off it banged. This went on through the entire night. The bathroom has to win an award for the worst layout I have ever seen. The toilet is so close to the door, that when you are sitting, your knees are actually touching the bathroom door.The hotel restaurant has closed and a Cora's has opened up next door with a very limited menu. We went up to have a look at the spa area which opened up to replace the roof top pool. The floor were all cracking and there were actually holes in the walls. In my opinion this hotel is in serious need for some rennovations. The front lobby looks great but the rest of the hotel needs some work."
8,1362,"Jul 14 2009 	Nice but small ""Comfort Level"" rooms great location	Room was small but in great shape, price was great, awesome location, Cora restaurant in hotel only serves breakfast food. Would stay again for one overnight."
9,1362,"Jun 1 2009 	Nice Hotel - Fantastic Location	Came to Montreal for the weekend to visit some friends and booked into the Best Western Europa last minute. The staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment I arrived and the hotel has a nice up scale feel.The room was incredibly small and I could not imagine sharing it with another person but it was very clean and the bed was comfortable - I really didn't need any more than that. Plus it included free wireless internet which really came in handy. The restaurant in the lobby served a great breakfast but it's the location that makes this hotel a real winner.Just steps from St. Catherine Street, it is right in the middle of the shopping district during the day and the club district for nightly entertainment. There are fantastic restaurants of all kinds every where and many attractions and museums all with in walking distance. As well Old Montreal is only about a 15-20 min walk away. And considering the price I paid for the room, the Europa is a terrific deal! It was a great choice for me and I'll definitly stay here again next time I'm in town!"

11,1362,"Apr 30 2009 	OK	Good location, decent room. The staff were just okay. We booked a 3person room through AAA, however they gave us problems when we checked in. I didn't like how we were treated, which was too bad because I liked the bartender. He gave us more inside information than the staff and he certainly had more smiles! Parking was a bit off-site, but it is a city!"
12,1362,Feb 17 2009 	Small Room	Pretty clean hotel booked it to save some money after wish I had spent a little more. Was basically a bed in this tiny room hard to walk around the bed. One receptionist was great the other very rude (because I was anglo) If money is and issue then this is an okay option close to Bell Centre! Go Habs Go!
13,1362,"Feb 11 2009	Bad breakfast	Nice hotel and location, but the breakfast...If they call a very small glass of orange juice, a slice of bread and a glass of coffee breakfast..."
14,1362,"Dec 4 2008 	I was disappointed	We got a good deal so we booked this hotel. When we arrived, we found out that the pool was closed for repair and that the higher floors were also closed for repairs due to the fact that the hotel was not busy. The room we were first given was tiny and one of the lamps had no bulb in it. The worst part was the location. It faced a court yard where if people were outside they would literally be able to look right into the room. After complaining, we were offered another room which was only slightly better. We finally decided to pay a little more for a king-sized room. This room was much larger and the bed was great, although the room could have been decorated a little nicer. We were two people but were only supplied with one bar of soap so we asked at the front desk for more soap. We went out and were told that it would be brought up to our room. This never happened. We had to request it a second time. We discovered late at night that the shower drain was not working properly which meant that the bathtub would fill up rapidly while taking a shower. When we mentioned this to the front desk at checkout the next morning, requesting some compensation for the lack of good facilities, we were told that we should have called for someone to come up and fix the shower or ask to be moved to another room. Given that it was late by the time we took our showers and that we had already moved rooms, we were too tired to do that. The person at the front desk was not very friendly and did not offer any kind of apology or compensation."
15,1362,Nov 4 2008 	okay- good location	hotel was in good location right in the main part of city .lobby was very weird and abit off putting - large weird statue in fountain ?? odd very odd !!room was fine nice and comfy and big enough just standard 3 star hotel room .. staff were not that friendly .. cheap good breakfast downstairs .. we got very cheap price i would not pay too much for this.. wasn't bad just try something else .. unless you get it very cheap ..
16,1362,"Oct 15 2008 	Great Location	We really enjoyed our stay here at the Best Western Europa. It was centrally located and very close to the VIA station for you train riders.If you like the 'clubbing' area, and brand name shops; then this place is for you. If you like the Europe feel and want to venture over to Old Montreal its about a 15-20min walk. There is also Saint Laurent, and that is about a 10-15min walk away. Really great places. Really nice hotel. Also very affordable for the location.Thanks!"
17,1362,"Oct 3 2008 	Great Location For Nightlife	This hotel is on the corner of Rue Drummond and St. Catherine Ouest, only 3 blocks from Rue Crescent where there are great restaurants and bars including Grumpy's, The Hard Rock, and Saturday's. The staff is very friendly at the front desk. There's an ATM right in the lobby for &quot;re-fueling&quot; stops. Parking is right across the street, but I have experienced vandalism in the lot, so you might want to look for alternative parking. The rooms are fairly small with a definite &quot;European&quot; feel right down to the narrow hallways. But everything was very clean.There's a &quot;pool&quot; on one of the higher floors but I found it very small. Fortunately I think I'm the only one who knows it's there, as I've never seen anyone else in it.I would recommend this hotel for a budget traveller who wants a home base for the &quot;St. Catherine's Scene&quot;."
18,1362,"Sep 4 2008 	Hardly worth the cheaper rate	Why so bad...Bathroom in lobby contained several non-flushing toilets filled with feces. Lobby was decorated strangely, looked like the inside of a swimming pool. Hotel room so tiny that a bed and dresser wouldn't fit in it. Dresser drawers could only be opened half-way and one had to squeeze around furniture items.Understaffed at front desk (takes half an hour to speak with anyone at front desk) This is typical of all Best Westerns. Also we overheard staff being argumentative/disrespectful with customers.Did not get a wink of sleep since ice machine was loud, used all night long and could be clearly heard outside thin hotel room door.Pair of leather boots we accidentally left in hotel room had mysteriously vanished when we tried to collect them 3 days later. (Hotel staff member gains new pair of boots?)Why did we choose it?Because we got a good rate for it from Booking.com ($99.00 CAD ). Best Western is smart enough to know that they wouldn't get customers otherwise.Worth it? Probably not."
19,1362,"Sep 1 2008 	Great Hotel at a Terrific Location	I have stayed at this hotel three times over the past 10 years, and each time I have come back primarily because of this hotel's terrific location. All rooms I have had were quite decent, only one of them was on the small side. Service has overall been good, only once I came across an uncooperative front desk person. Overall, though, I would definitely come back to this hotel."
20,1362,"Aug 12 2008 	Just dandy	I booked the Europa as part of a reasonably priced airfare + hotel package. Based on prior reviews I wasn't expecting much from the Europa. The place isn't fancy and the lobby area looks a little dated, but that's a really about the only flaw I found, a ver minor one at that. I was surprised to get a spotlessly clean, spacious, modern room. It looked like it had just been remodeled and refurnished the day before. Everything in the room worked perfectly, including the air conditioning and the free wireless internet (both of those are always a hit-or-miss propositions). I didn't have many occasions to request assistance from the staff but the few times I did everything was chop-chop (that's a good thing). Also, the location was perfect for my needs. I would recommend this hotel to anyone needing basic but comfortable accommodations in downtown Montreal."
21,1362,"Jul 5 2008 	Small rooms	We had a four night stay at this hotel recently. The room that we were checked into was very small, with little room in which to store luggage. The corridors are also narrow, adding to the claustrophobic feeling. The location is handy, with the metro and many shopping areas just a short stroll away. Unfortunately for us, there were inconsiderate guests staying and we were woken at 3am. I would not recommend the hotel for long stays."
22,1362,"Jun 29 2008 	Great Location Good Price	I made a last minute decision to visit Montreal and had a difficult time finding an affordable hotel that was in a great location with great reviews. I found it at Best Western. You can walk to Crescent St. where all the bars and clubs are at, plus it's a block away from Rue St. Catherine. If you want to visit St. Laurent Blvd. or Old Montreal, take a cab or the Metro. The staff was friendly and helpful, the place was clean and my room was quiet. The room is smaller than your standard American hotel, but if you're in Montreal, you shouldn't be spending much time in your room. I would definitely recommend this place."
23,1362,"Jun 27 2008 	It is a good hotel in a great location!	It is a good hotel in a great location! Steps to shopping, museums and attractions.Try Spa Orange, located at the 6th floor. It is a must foe every spa traveler; an full service spa with great amenities and many services. We tried sabai stone massageasia couple, and it was paradise."
24,1362,"Jun 26 2008 	You get what you pay for at this hotel	My room seemed to be a closet converted into a room. Very small. For instance when sitting on the toilet my knees were mushed into the bathtub. I am not sure if all rooms are the same but I found this amusing.The hotel is a great location - very close to the Bell Centre and St Catherine's street. It is very close to the Metro as well. It is also next door to a fire station so at points in the night you will hear sirens. Because of the close proximity to St Catherine's Street the hotel got pretty noisy on Friday night when some people enjoying the nightlife came back to their room.I would say this could be a great affordable hotel for some, and a below average hotel for others - it all depends on if you are in Montreal to go out and adventure or not."
25,1362,"May 29 2008 	loved this hotel	I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel , I was there during the easter weekend, the staff was great, the rooms were extremely clean, it was closed to my meetings. i will visit again with my family."
26,1362,"May 1 2008 	Great Location	I booked 3 rooms in this hotel for a family trip to Montreal. We stayed there 2 nights and overall I'm happy with the decision to choose this hotel. The hotel structure is old but in good condition and present great value for the money.The best thing about this hotel is the location. If you plan to spend time in downtown Montreal there is no better place. You are just off rue Sainte-Catherine (St. Catherine Street) - Montreal 5th Ave. and all major shopping and entertainment attractions.The rooms we stayed at were clean and tidy. Check-in and check-out was quick and staff was friendly upon requests for extra towels.The hotel has an adjacent restaurant, where we had breakfast, we didn't use the hotel Bar and Restaurant, as I'm sure the options around were much better.On the downside I have to mention that the mattress and pillow were not very comfortable in all rooms (226, 227, 229 - all double beds rooms) and the drainage of the bath was very slow. TVs are small and picture in some channels was grainy, no special kids channels, only in the morning.I would certainly recommend this hotel for the budgeted traveller who can compromise some in-room pleasure for the great location and cost."
27,1362,Mar 20 2008 	Great Location	This hotel is in a perfect location if you are planning on hitting up shopping on St. Catherine Street and the Bars/Clubs on Cresent. My room (204) had two double beds and was rather large. My friends were in 206 and it was slightly smaller but still a decent size. My room was at the end of a hallway so not too noisy. The service at the front desk was friendly and helpful.
28,1362,"Feb 28 2008 	Good hotel great location	The hotel is located about 15 minutes (in taxi) from the airport. The staff was great, the hotel rooms were a good size for 2 people. Very clean rooms, nice views. We went to see our Atlanta Thrashers play the Canadians at Centre Bell and it was a block from the hotel which was perfect. The hotel lobby was decorated very nice also. Great choice!"
29,1362,Dec 19 2007 	Great location....	The hotel had a great location. We parked the car when we arrived and walked around to the places we needed to go. We parked in a lot across the street for $20 per day. St. Catherine Street is the next street up and there was a lot of places to shop and eat. We were a little taken back by the size of our king size room. The area that the bed was in was very small. We considered asking to upgrade to a larger room. The bathroom was large and the mirror was big enough for two people to use at the same time. The restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch had very poor service. Our waitress basically disappeared and we had to ask another waitress for our check. The food that we chose was not good (awful crepes). We used the hotel website and prepaid online so it was only 99.00 plus taxes so for that price it was reasonable. We are going to Montreal again in March and I have already booked a different hotel.
30,1362,"Nov 29 2007	Bettern than the typical Best Western in the US	ROOM:We had a queen bedroom at the end of the hallwayand the room was super small!!I've never stayed at the such a small hotel room before.But it was quite clean and furnitures were good. Definately not the cheap kind. I loved the beddings as well. Mattress was firm andsheets were clean.The room did have a coffee maker and condiments, and 2 mugs. They prodvided a free wireless internet service, but you need to get the access code from the front desk.Bathroom was clean and nice.LOCATION:Awesome location! It's in the middle of the downtown shopping area and the Metro(subway) is only 2-3 blocks away.There also is a hair salon and and Cora restaurant for breakfast &amp; dinner on the lobby. We had a breakfast at the Cora, and it was very satisfying. I highly recommend!!They do have a fitness center along with their new Spa facility.PARKING:There is a public, paid parking lot across from the hotel andit was $20 for 24hours. It's an outdoor parking, but it was safe enough.GETTING AROUND:After getting some informations from the front desk(they are very helpful), we immediately went out to take the Metro to get to the Old City. Metro was $2.75 per person, one way. We had to transfer to another train after 3 stops, but it was very easy to transfer once you follow the signs. I think it took us less than 20min to get to the old city area by Metro. It was a good experience.SHOPPING:When I asked the front desk staff the hours for the undergroundshopping, he said 9am-9pm. But I guess that was only during the weekdays?? We were there on saturday and all the shops were closed by 6pm. That was very disappointing."
31,1362,"Nov 5 2007 	great service but terrible smoking problem	I stayed at the Best Western Europa for a dance seminar and show. We were there for two nights. The hotel has a beautiful lobby, with several restaurants. Chez Cora is a breakfast lunch place that is quite good with good service. Therew as also a Chinese restaurant and the Oasis cafe. The included breakfast was no longer included or served, starting with the weekend we arrived they no longer do a continental breakfast. This was a surprise as their website indicated that they did have one.The room was not too small. It had two double beds, no view, and a reasonable bathroom. The bathroom amenities were average for this type of hotel. There were plenty of towels and pillows and the room was the right temperature.We did have a problem that the room was quite smelly. We had requested a non-smoking room but it was clear that people had been smoking in our room in the past. Across the hall, two men were smoking all night in their non-smoking room. When they opened the door, it set off the fire alarm, waking us all up at 5am. When I got home, my spouse asked if I had been with a smoker as my clothing smelled. The stuffed animal I brought with me also had obtained a disgusting aroma. I know that cigarettes and Montreal are like New York and bagels, but it is unfair to make a room non-smoking and then have it not be. My friend is allergic to cigarette smoke and she started to develop a rash.The services at the hotel for our event were quite good. The food was good at the buffet. I enjoyed buying drinks from their extremely hot bartender, with his adorable ponytail. The staff at the hotel is very friendly and welcoming."
32,1362,"Nov 4 2007 	Comfy 	My boyfriend and I spent 2 nights at this hotel (we booked it thru Bonjour Quebec, an extremely helpful website!) and we were very happy with the room, location and staff.The bathroom is very small but spotless...we were walking distance to restaurants, shopping and Mont Royal and easily took the Metro to other attractions... the staff was very friendly and helpful. The Restaurant inside the hotel (Chez ?) served the best breakfast we've ever had at a ridiculous low price! If you don't intend on spending alot of time in your room (because it isn't roomy) I highly recommend this hotel. :)"
33,1362,"Oct 9 2007	Great little hotel	We stayed here for 4 nights on the Thanksgiving (CDN) long weekend, and have nothing but good things to say about it. Our first trip to Montral, so we ended up asking hotel staff for directions numerous times; they couldn't have been more helpful. On their website, they advertise a pool/gym/hottub, but we didn't find any of them in the hotel; not a deal breaker though as we weren't in town to visit the hotel.Yes, the &quot;theme&quot; is a little 20000 Leagues Under The Sea-ish, but the hotel bar has a very nice vibe to it (captain's quarters it seemed) for a quick drink. There's a nice breakfast restaurant attached which was a late discovery on our part; definitely head there if you want to treat yourself to a good breakfast.Location couldn't be better; literally a 10 second walk from Rue St-Catherine, and under 5 mins from Rue Crescent.....as we walked around we looked for similarly priced hotels with as good a location; maybe there are some but we couldn't find any.Rooms are small, but we didn't find it a problem; bathrooms are tight, and the toilet can get even tighter. We would definitely go back, if not for the location, then for the friendly service of the hotel staff. I see a lot of the negative reviews were written a number of years ago; maybe there was a management change, but we didn't encounter any &quot;rude&quot; employees..even the cleaning staff was very pleasant when we'd run into them in the halls.We would recommend it."
34,1362,"Sep 30 2007 	Would stay again	If you plan to be out and about and are only staying a night or 2, this place is great. Location is excellent - just a half block away from Rue St. Catherine for plenty of shops, great eateries, and entertainment. The Old Port is about a 20 minute walk away. The rooms are definitely small so keep that in mind if you're staying a little longer, and there are so many great restaurants and cafes nearby that I wouldn't bother booking with breakfast included."
35,1362,"Aug 16 2007 	Wouldn't Recommend Staying Here Stay Elsewhere!	Well, for starters I booked my reservation for four people but, along with the confirmation from the Best Western sent to my email it said that I could change the reservation anytime before Thursday August 9, 2007. I did that at the end of July 2007 seeing that one of the four people couldn't attend do to personal circumstances. Instead of keeping the two rooms I thought that I changed it to one room instead of the two rooms. I guess that once you book a room with the Best Western at the 800# you can't change the reservation that it says you can in your email to confirm the reservation (so many days in advance). Totally disgusted by that part. Well, we arrived on Friday August 10, 2007 and they didn't have the one room that I thought was changed. They had the two rooms instead, the original reservation for $119.00 a night, at a total rate of $418.98 a piece. I was totally dissatisfied from my arrival. The rooms are on the very small side and if someone is walking around the bed from the window where the desk is someone had better sit down to let the person go by, because there just isn't enough room for two people to go by each other at all. Dissatisfied! The parking for the Best Western is across the street for $20 a day in a open parking lot (I checked on my car the entire time because nobody was at the lot watching the cars). Especially when they aren't responsible for what happens to your vehicle. Then on Friday August 10, 2007 (sometime after our arrival) we were sent a notice under both of our doors that we would be getting the breakfast in the morning from 6:30am-11:00am for the following morning. Well, when we got there on Saturday August 11, 2007 we were told that we didn't pay for the breakfast with the room. How much does a person have to pay extra to get a complientary breakfast in Montreal with the room? In the United States it comes with the room last time I checked in the area that I live in and a much nicer breakfast from what I was told by my daughter. What I saw at the breakfast wasn't something that I would ever pay for while traveling in my life. We all were disgusted by this and we moved to a wonderful place Chez Cora on Rue Stanley were they serve wonderful breakfast at wonderful prices. If you go try the strawberry/banana smoothie as it comes with a strawberry and grapes for $3.25. We ate there every morning during our stay. Sunday August 12, 2007 we started having a problem with our toilet in one of the rooms as it wouldn't flush. It didn't flush the rest of the time while we were there. Also, during the whole stay we all had a hard time getting water to flow alot and didn't have much hot water so to speak of, totally disgusted with the room and the price that I paid. When I checked out the Best Western Downtown Europa online at the beginning of the year 2007 I thought that they had a pool, they don't have a pool at all. Would of liked to have a pool after walking around seeing the sights all day while we were there. I guess they only have a fitness center and spa. After all the walking that you do why do you need to go to the fitness center at the Best Western? I wouldn't recommend staying here in Downtown Montreal try staying some place else instead."
36,1362,"Jul 17 2007 	what a disappointment!	I've stayed at numerous BW hotels across the USA and I would have to rate the Europa in Montreal as one of the worst BW hotel that I've ever stayed in. Its true, the rooms(and bathroom) are small but they are clean. The elevators take a very long time during checkout in the morning and are so small that its hard to fit two people including luggage. The photos on the the hotel website are very misleading but the worst part of my stay was the &quot;continental breakfast&quot; that was included in the rather expensive price of the room. I arrived at 10:00am for the breakfast which is served from 6:30am - 11:00am. The so called &quot;breakfast&quot; was dismal to say the least. There was only one bagel left and hardly any other food at all! I watched as a few other guests arrived after me looking for food and they looked as disappointed as I did! The hotel was filled with students partying all night long as if it was spring break. For the same price, I can't imagine anyone would stay here rather than one of the other hotels on Sherbrooke like the Marriott!"
37,1362,"Jul 16 2007 	Great Place Location Price Service	The hotel lobby is very uniquely designed, the staff were extremely nice and helpful. Rooms are clean with new furniture.Room was cleaned every day, towels changed etc. - very happy.Location is fantastic - right on St. Catharines close to Place des Arts and all sorts of shops, restaurants and entertainment, very close to Peel subway station. Fantastic restaurants in the vicinity!Checking out was also a pleasure - could safely store our luggage and go for a walk. Also, on a budget esp. during jazz festival time when everything was overbooked and overpriced!Would recomment and definitely come back!!"
38,1362,"Jun 18 2007	Good location 	We stayed at the hotel as part of a room block for a wedding from June 14 - 17. I had read some of the reviews and had some concerns about the size of the rooms, location and customer service. We had a room with 2 double beds on the 2nd floor (214). The parents we were traveling with had a queen bed room also on the 2nd floor (211). Their bathroom was plenty big but I'm not sure if it's because I requested a bigger one. The reservationist indicated some were bigger. The bathroom in our room with 2 double beds was plenty big enough as well. Pros:- Location was fantastic- Breakfast available- Free passes to Nautilus Plus gym (around corner on St. Catherine) since their gym is renovating -- Nautilus is an amazing gym so it worked out better- Gave us several options for where to park - parked in lot directly across from hotel which turned out to be fine (safe)- Rooms clean and AC unit worked- Good price (ours was a little discounted b/c of wedding block but not much)- Big closet in double beds roomCons:- Had to ask for extar towels a couple times- Vending machines kept running out of water- Room service is only an Asian restaurant- Kept running out of items and having to ask to refill them at breakfast (i.e. milk, fruit bowl, etc)Overall this hotel worked out well for us and we'd stay there again. The front desk also told me they are renovating their spa, gym facilities and sauna into this large spa for those coming in the future (after Sept 2007)."
39,1362,Jun 12 2007 	Best value in the city	We stayed at this hotel about 2 years ago and werent to impressed. We decided after shopping around to stay again because their price was good and the location is amazing. The hotel has since renovated and most lily gone through different managment becasue this place was soooo muich better this time. The new rooms are much nicer and well allocated and the bar and public areas are really well kept and presented. Their hotel bar is beautiful and the staff durin our whole trip was absolutly great and helpt us with a few problems which we had very well. WOULD DEFINETLY STAY AGAIN!. BEST LOCATION!!
40,1362,"May 29 2007 	Great Location	We stayed here from May 23 to 28. We picked it for it's location. And it is a great location. Very central and easy to get to either Metro lines. Good Points: good location, good continental breakfast at good price, staff was very pleasant. Very good internet connections and free.Bad Points: tinest room I have ever been in, the washroom was so tiny that when you sat on toilet you had to sit sideways or your knees would hit tub, about 3 inch clearance between the two. No place to put toilitries in bathroom. Bed was so hard I felt I was back in Mexico, would wake up throughout night with sore side. Air Conditioner was so noisy it would wake us whenever it kicked in. Bedding -- there is a duvet but this hotel uses a sheet on the bottom and a sheet on top, hopefully they clean the duvet regularily. Note: when we originally booked it stated on website and others that this was entirely non smooking, but this is not the case. Pool and jacquzi are closed for renovations until Sept."
41,1362,"Apr 15 2007	Worst North American room ever	This hotel had the worst room I have ever seen in a North American hotel: dark, tiny, and overpriced, even in Canadian dollars. I've occasionally seen rooms this small in Europe, but never before or since in Canada or the U.S. You could barely move in the bathroom. The monstrous air conditioner actually touched the bed. There was about six inches of space between the TV and the foot of the bed."
42,1362,"Mar 13 2007 	bad jacuzi no steam room broken sauna	My friend and I stayed at this hotel for a night out in Montreal and to relax. The room was clean. The manager/head desk person was kinda sleezy and recomended a horrible restaurant (The Angus Steak House) next door for dinner and proceeded to try and sell us on other places to eat that sounded just as bad. The &quot;jacuzi/pool&quot; had about 6 jets and was about 15' by 6' - their picture is deceiving. The sauna was not working and there is NO steamroom! Their security person made us uncomfortable, he came up to the sixth floor where the &quot;jacuzi&quot; is three times in the 20 min. we were in there."
43,1362,"Feb 28 2007 	Great Stay on a Budget	My mother and I recently spent a weekend doing some shopping in Montreal, and booked at the Best Western Europa because we had a gift card from Best Western.We were a little worried, having read some negative reviews, and another Best Western in the city told us the hotel was terrible. We loved it. We had requested a non-smoking room, and one that had been recently renovated. We checked in early, our requested room was ready, and very nice. Great fixtures in the little, brand new bathroom, and a very comfy bed.The best part of our stay was their oversized indoor jacuzzi, where we had a great long 'soak' after a long day of walking around the shops. The hotel is only about a block from St Catherine Street - you really can't find a better location to access the shops. We were not looking for anything fancy, just a comfortable place to sleep, and it met our needs perfectly."
44,1362,"Jul 21 2006 	Close to (almost) everything	My wife &amp; I have traveled from North-east U.S. &amp; stayed here numerous times over the last 6 years. I agree with most of the comments from previous reviewers, however no one mentioned how close the Metro (subway) is to The Europa. It is only a 3 minute walk &amp; will let you off within a 10 minute stroll to Olde Montreal &amp; Port area.The surrounding hotel area will cater to almost every vice &amp; craving with shops, cigars, coffee, desserts , nightclubs &amp; yes, gents, even adult entertainment. Yes, the parking is a bit steep (&amp; made worse by the cranky old coot in the booth ) but it is close to the hotel. The small coffee shop in the lobby will make a tastier &amp; stronger cup than your room coffee maker. Now if they could only fit more than 3 in the elevator......"
45,1362,"Jul 3 2006	Perfect for the budget-minded and location!	When searching for a good place to stay, centrally located and also a prime spot for the budget-minded person, don't look past the Best Western Europa in downtown Montreal. This was the second time I have stayed here and I will say that I wasn't disappointed. We paid under $100 (U.S.) per night for the room and it was everything I expected. I didn't go in expecting the Ritz Carlton and was quite happy with everything. I have added photos of our room to this review. I, unfortunately, forgot to take pictures of the parking lot and the outside of the hotel. I had planned to take those shots, but forgot. Before getting to my pros and cons, I'll go through a couple of things. The desk people and housekeeping staff were considerate and friendly. They were also very helpful when needed and always welcomed you when coming back into the hotel. The interior is interesting and clean. I didn't check out any of the restaurants or bar in the hotel -- or any other the other hotel amenities -- so I can't comment on those.I have pretty easy standards when it comes to hotels and traveling: price, cleanliness, location and safety. I'm not looking for all the bells and whistles some people look for when traveling. Taking all those into consideration, the Best Western was a great place to be at. So first, I'll go to the pros. PROS- The room was extremely clean when we first arrived. Each day the room was cleaned and shaped up. The staff was quick and courteous when dealing with this. - The beds were comfortable and there were more than enough sheets and pillows on each bed (we had a double room). - The TV was decent sized (25-27 inch or so) and worked well. We didn't use it much, but it was nice to have when needed. - Free wireless Internet access. Very easy to connect to and quite speedy. It was nice to be able to check my email and not have to dial up somewhere. - The water in the shower was powerful enough for me. I like it when there is actually water pressure. In this situation, I wasn't disappointed. - The location for the hotel is perfect. Situated on Drummond, you are steps from St. Catharine St., and two blocks from Crescent St. The whole area is perfect. It's also a very safe area. - In regard to safety, the hotel has a system set up where you have to use your key card to enter the hotel after a certain time as well as needing said card to access the elevator after a certain time. In five nights in Montreal, I also never had any problems with my key cards. - I can't reiterate how nice and helpful the staff was. We didn't utilize them often, but with checking in, checking out and the few questions we asked, they were always professional and smiling. You can't ask for much more than that. - Just a couple blocks from a metro station (Peel), which is even better.MIDDLE GROUND (Not a con for me, but might be for others).- Room size. It's small, so don't let anyone kid you differently. You can see in my photos that the room is tight. But it's to be expected. I've stayed in probably 8-9 different hotels in my travels to Montreal and not many have huge rooms. Not in this price range, anyway. For two people traveling and probably even three -- this wouldn't be bad. We had a king room a couple years ago and had 4-5 people and it wasn't bad. But the double we were in isn't made for many more than 2-3 people. I could see where a family would have a hard time with it. But, if you don't expect to spend much time there, it's not bad.- Parking. The lot is across the street and independently owned. It's $20 (Can) per night. They jam a lot of cars in the lot. There is also a parking lot about 3 buildings down from the hotel. These lots are a little shabby, but did the job for me. There always seemed to be someone on duty, which was nice. My car was perfect when we left and nothing had happened. Seemed fine to me, but I know a lot of people are worried about the lot. - The air conditioner. This kind of goes as a pro and con for me. The pro part was that it worked well. The con part is when you put the shade over the window at the night, it kind of covered it, so by morning, the AC wasn't flowing as well and it was warmer in the room. - Elevators. There are two of them and they are each pretty small. Didn't bother me because we were never trying to cram in with a ton of others, but I could see where if people were staying longer and had a lot more luggage, it could be hard to use these. CONSThe only reason I couldn't give the hotel a 5-star rating was that there were a couple things I would consider cons. Now mind you, I gave this place a 4, but it was actually like a 4.5. - Bathroom size. I like a bigger bathroom. I hate having to feel cramped when I'm getting out of the shower. I felt that way here. I was out of the shower and right in front of the toilet and sink. It was too crammed for my liking. - Windows. There was one window in the main room and one in the bathroom (although the glass they used for the one in the bathroom wouldn't allow you to look out, it was more to allow light in). The window wasn't too big and it was partially taken up by the AC unit. I just like natural light, so an extra or bigger window would have been nice. - Electric outlets. There weren't enough of them near the chairs/table, allowing two people to plug laptops in, as well as keeping a lamp and the TV plugged in. They were too spread out and in spots where they were only good for like charging camera batteries or a cell phone. Wasn't too bad, but could be a little annoying.OVERVIEWThe positives of this hotel far outweighed the negatives. While we had some cons with our stay, they weren't enough to make us sour on the hotel. It was a pleasant stay and well worth the money. We stayed for five nights and each was fine. Checking in and checking out were both easy and painless. The room was ready when we arrived and everyone was friendly. I'd stay here again and would highly recommend others to stay here."

I had no worries about walking around at nighttime.However the rooms are shabby and in need of a complete overhaul.We had 3 rooms on 3 seperate floors for our various family and all 3 were shabby, dimly lit, chipped furniture, stained carpets, torn or loose wallpaper and paint and stained ceilings. Bathrooms were very small ( even by uUK standards) and electrical system was dubious.Power sockets were loose on walls and coffee maker was in bathroom right at the side of the sink. The phrase, electricity and water , springs to mind.The corridors were uninviting and scruffy.The staff were very helpful and friendly.The restaurant was pricy and the cafe joined to the hotel was erratic with opening hours.This has a 4 * grading and i have seen many other hotels in Montreal with this grading much more appealing than this.I would not stay here again, nor recommend to others."
47,1362,"Jun 6 2006	Exactly what I wanted	I stayed at the BW Europa in May 2006. It is still a Best Western, unlike some of the listings in Trip Advisor. I had booked on the Internet at about 100 dollars through the BW website which I have found gets me a better price than some discount websites - I would struggle to get any hotel at this price in the UK.The location was ideal for me being 10 minutes walk from the main rail station and 5 minutes from Crescent and St Catherine. I had no problems on the streets up to 11 pm.I was well pleased by the hotel. The second floor room was freshly refurbished with a nice bathroom and had an ironing board and iron. It looked onto in internal courtyard and was quiet, I had one disturbance which may have been a rubbish collection but nothing else. The front and sides look onto quiet streets. Only at the rear where there is an open car park and a view onto Crescent would I think there might be some noise. The shower worked well. Breakfast was from 6 am to 11 with an attentive and helpful waiter offering a wide variety of breakfast items. The restaurant was closed on Sunday night but there are plenty of places to eat on Crescent. I would change one thing and put a bigger shelf in the bathroom if I were going to share the room. Everything was very clean and staff polite and helpful.As to the comments made by others, you might not like that the rooms were compact with no safe. Neither of these issues bothered me. I didnt need to park, I travel by train and rent a car if I need one on the day. The room would be cosy with 2 guests sharing.There is another Best Western on Sherbrooke, nearer the University but further out of the centre. Sherbrooke is quite busy with traffic. I think I chose the right one with the Europa and I would go again."
48,1362,"May 1 2006	Fine with us!	We were very satisfied with this hotel. We booked short notice, two days ahead and paid $129.00. It is a short walk from the train station; when we arrived (around noon) our room was not ready but the reception desk kindly offered to store our luggage. We took off for lunch and returned a few hours later but the room was still not ready. The staff were very apologetic and offered us a jacuzzi suite so we were pleased. The room was lovely! We had a great nights sleep and did not here any street noise. We went down for breakfast and had lots of fruit, etc. Our train did not leave until after check-out time but reception offered to store our luggage again which we thought was quite nice. The location of this hotel is super. I'm not sure if we just got lucky or if the rooms are being renovated but we had no complaints about anything!"
49,1362,"Apr 17 2006	It's the PITS!	I believe that this hotel misrepresents itself on the web. Yes parking is available,...it costs $20.00 per day to have it parked in a crumbling lot outside in front of the hotel. Breakfast was supposed to come with the reservation,...if breakfast counts as the self-serve coffee pot in your room, than I guess that's breakfast. There was no exercise room per the advertisement. The curtain in the room didn't close all the way and the hotel is downtown with bright city lights shining in. The heat didn't work and the man at the front desk resolved the situation by sending up extra blankets. The room was the size of a broom closet and the bathroom was so small, I had to put my feet on the edge of the tub to sit down on the toilet. They did have hot water, it just took five minutes to warm up. And the bed was so hard I would've been better off on the floor. And finally, they made the bed in a funky way by sandwiching the comforter in between two flat sheets to hide the stained mess of a comforter they had on the bed. As for the help, everyone actually seemed nice enough, they just didn't have any answers. I asked how much a phone call was and after waiting for fifteen minutes the girl came back with a helpless shrug. Even during peak lobby hours, they only had one girl behind the desk who was friendly enough, but it took us over an hour to check-out. I'm a well travelled person and I don't expect a lot out of a hotel, but this is by far the worst hotel I've stayed in outside of a third world country."
50,1362,"Mar 4 2006	Close to everything!	Great hotel! Good food at the resturant, great bar for relaxing and close to shopping and the Via Rail station"
51,1362,"Feb 16 2006	Smallest room ever...	Man, I look back and think abt this place and I'm like amazed. This place had the tiniest room EVER. Two people can't move around this room. We were hating ourselves for booking this room, but then we thought it was funny to bump into each other :-)The parking is a pain too. The only good part is it's downtown and you can walk around the place...I'd not go there again and suggest people to get a bigger room unless, of course, you're single. The pictures on their website actually enticed us. The lobby was great though, should admit..."
52,1362,"Nov 27 2005 	Left after the first night	I left the hotel for another one after the first night -- had I just trusted the bad reviews here...The room consisted of a large TV set (American-style), a bed, and a bathroom. It was lacking daylight (the window -- to the extent it wasn't blocked by the gargantuous air conditioner -- gave me a view of the courtyard, which had its ground level above the floor of the room), a chair, a table, and even an elementary amount of space.The breakfast buffet was rather elementary and uninviting, the coffee dreadful.I can confirm the alarm clocks in other room comments from others, and can also confirm the seemingly-recent over-the-top-ness of the lobby, which contrasts heavily with the rest of the hotel.There was nothing charming or &quot;European&quot; about this hotel. Don't go there."
53,1362,"Oct 25 2005 	I will never stay here again	I am a seasoned traveller &amp; this is by far the WORST place I have ever stayed. The only thing going for it is the location - it's right off Ste-Catherine St, one of the main drags in Montreal. But that's it.I checked in at 4:30pm on a Wednesday &amp; learned that my room wasn't yet ready, although check-in was 3pm. No apology or offer of alternate accomodations. I had requested a queen bed, non-smoking room and had to argue for something else in the meantime. They offered me a room with 2 doubles instead, since I absolutely had to prepare for a meeting and needed my room. I took it and when I made it upstairs, the room they had given me was under renovation -- construction tools all over the floor, the window A/C unit on the ground, dirt everywhere, no toilet. When I went back down to the front desk, there was again no apology and I was told I would need to wait at least 1 hours for ANYTHING to become available to me.It turns out the guy serving me was the front desk manager and didn't give a hoot about the extremely inconvenient situation in which he was placing me. I was carrying 2 suitcases and a laptop and he claimed there was no room for him to check them somewhere for me so that I could at least go find something to eat while waiting for my room. Luckily some extremely nice travellers from BC overheard my predicament and offered to keep my bags in THEIR room.Came back to the hotel at 6pm, as told, and finally my room was available, 3 hours after the 3pm check-in. Went upstairs, the key doesn't work. Went downstairs for re-coding. Back upstairs, key doesn't work again. Back downstairs for re-coding. Once I finally got in my room, to my utter non-surprise, the Europa drops the ball AGAIN. They gave me the most filthy, disgusting smoking room I've ever been in - browned wallpaper, film on the windows and cigarette burns on the bedspread. The smell was absolutely putrid (my brief time in this room had smelled up my clothes so badly that I had to have them cleaned the next day).Furious, I returned to the front desk and demanded the room I reserved. Luckily there had been a shift change and the useless front desk manager had been replaced by a lovely young woman who was gracious, apologetic and very understanding. She booked me into a suite with a king bed for my trouble. The room was acceptable, but dated and like the rest of the hotel, appeared cheap and dirty. There was a huge soaker tub in the bathroom which was its only redeeming quality. Given the overall shabby appearance of the hotel, my experience and the way I was treated, I will never stay here again. I wrote a 3-page complaint letter to Best Western head office once my trip was complete and they were at least nice enough to offer up a written apology for my negative experience.FYI, there is no parking available here, just a paid lot across the street. As well, all the windows in the rooms are sealed shut, so there is no way you can get fresh air into the room to at least chase some of the musty smell away.Do yourself a favour - spend an extra couple of bucks and go somewhere else. The price of this place is definitely appealing, but I learned the hard way that you get what you pay for."
54,1362,"Oct 5 2005	For those in need of a suite	We were able to find two rooms available at this hotel on a weekend with several conferences in town. We booked them right away over the phone without really knowing anything about the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, we were offered their penthouse suite, for the same $$ we were paying for the 2 seperate rooms. This is a huge suite. We had 2 very large rooms, 4!!!! bathrooms (1 with a whirlpool tub) a full eat in kitchen, very large living room, washer &amp; dryer &amp; the absolute best part was a large private tarrace with BBQ. This suite was very convinient as we were two families with 3 infants, &amp; they were able to run around all over. Now, for the negatives, While we thought this was a good deal for us, at the price we paid, we were told the running rate is apx. $1000.00 per night. At 1000.00 per night I would be very disapointed. The kitchen wasn't well stocked,( as to the basics, i.e., soap, paper towels, dish cloths, etc. ) the dryer in one bathroom wasn't working, one of the rooms did not have a t.v., there was a loud noise coming from the other side of the suite that sounded like some sort of machinery that went on all night long, it did not keep us, or more importantly our kids from sleeping, and you have to go up 2 flights of stairs, as the elevator stops two level below the suite. I would stay here again with kids, at the same price we paid."
55,1362,"Sep 30 2005	European Luxury with Parking Problems	This is a good location if you want to be near the business or shopping areas or if you want to watch NHL action at Bell Center. It is a bit far from Old Port, however.The hotel is easy to find but if you arrive by car be prepared to pay an extra 17 CAD per night. That will give you access to an independently owned parking lot opposite of the hotel. And in this downtown area you do not have much choice when it comes to finding a place for your car.Once you are inside the hotel you will find yourself in a clean and luxurious European-style environment. I stayed in a well-sized room with excellent furniture including a business chair. Also, you will find an in-room coffee maker and a hair dryer. No fridge or microwave, though. The only downside was that there was no outside view. Only a wall of the opposite building.There are different rate plans available. Make sure that the breakfast is included in your rate. It really is worth every cent. It is served in the hotel restaurant and includes many hot and cold items like sausages and fruit.The overall rating is definitely above average. However, the hotel could get an excellent rating if the parking situation was better solved."
56,1362,"Sep 6 2005	Best Western Europa Downtown	We stayed in the Best Western for 4 nights in August 2005. We were extremely happy with the hotel. Our room was on the 3rd floor, yes it was a bit small but we had enough room to manoeuve around the bottom of the bed - could have did without the table and chairs. We couldn't fault the hotel. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable, the staff again were fantastic and the cleaning lady gave me extra large towels for the whole of our stay. The breakfast each morning was extensive and tasty and replenished regularly. Like other reviewers said it is in prime location to St Catherine's Street and everything is easily accessible from there. Only downside is that we dined in a restaurant on our last nite and the waiter complained that we didnt give him enough of a tip (We thought 13% of the bill wasnt too bad). He informed us that the standard is 15-20% or more. I could not believe the cheek so beware when tipping!!!! We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - good value for money, prime location and good rooms."
57,1362,"Aug 24 2005	Nice place to stay	We stayed there for 2 nights in July 2005. The room was small, but very clean. The AC was loud and either just cold as ice or you to turn it off. Very friendly staff. The Breakfast was great. At that time the swimming world championships were in Montreal and we had the waterpolo team of Australia in our hotel. That was positive for my spouse, so she had something more to look at it. The hotel is near Bell Center and St. Catherines Street. If youre looking for a nice hotel at a fair price, this is the place to stay."
58,1362,"Aug 22 2005	Not bad really!	I guess it all depends on the traveller. I wouldn't stay here on a romantic weekend with my wife, but the purpose of my stay here was to go to the Hockey game with my buddies!The location is perfect, as mentioned in other reviews, and it is about a two minute walk to Centre Bell. One of the closest hotels to the arena. I think I was also blessed with the only large room of all the reviews. There was more than enough space in our double room.I really is good value."
59,1362,"Aug 9 2005	Not bad !	Hello !I have spend 3 nights in this hotel. I had booked it before I had read the reviews here so I was a bit worried that maybe I had booked too quickly. Ok, the lobby is a bit over the top, so what ? The room was small, but clean. So was the bathroom. I live in Europe and over here we are quite used to small rooms like that. There was a welcome coffee and tea set in the room. The airco can be put cooler or warmer, you just have to find the buttons. The hotel is situated at 2 minutes from St-Catharine street which is great. In short, I didn't have any complaint here in this hotel. The staff was friendly as well. If you don't look for grand luxury this is a good hotel. Of course, if you want the big thing, then you better look for a 4-star hotel."
60,1362,"Jul 4 2005	The rest of the story ...	I booked a room here wearily after reading all the mixed reviews, then checked in and discovered the rest of the story. One TripAdvisor guest complains this hotel is a &quot;fire hazard&quot; because a set of emergency stairs leads to an alley -- what he/she doesn't say is the small five-story hotel is adjacent to a city firehouse, making the location one of the safest around. Yes, the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea lobby is definitely different, and, yes, many of the guest rooms are small, but for $100 U.S. a night on a summer festival weekend, I couldn't find a cleaner, more comfortable value (and I started looking six months ago). Everyone from the check-in staff to housekeeping crew was hardworking, polite and professional. I'm glad a few disgruntled reviewers expecting the Ritz didn't discourage me from making a reservation at this hotel. For its central location, cost, cleanliness and comfort, I'll definitely stay at the Europa again."
61,1362,"Jun 30 2005	Tiny room ok location	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night on our recent trip to Quebec. The location was fine and the staff friendly and helpful, the price was decent compared to what I could find on the web from the US. However, the room was really tiny, I mean much worse than similar hotels I'dstayed in. There was only one chair so one of us always had to sit on the bed. There was no room around the bed to open a suitcase, for example on the floor, or a table. We had to use the bed for that as well. The bathroom was large by comparison. This might be alright for one person with limited luggage but we were on the tail end of a two week vacation so we had two large suitcases and room didn't work for us at all. Of all the hotels we stayed in during our trip this was the only one that made us feel so claustrophobic."
62,1362,"Jun 27 2005	Great Stay for the Price	My husband stayed at this hotel for 4 nights while were in Montreal for the F1 races. The front desk staff were very nice and professional as were the maids and restaurant staff. The room was better than okay. It was clean and the area in which we stayed was quiet. We received free breakfast with our stay and it was okay but plentiful.Overall, I enjoyed this hotel. Free bottled water each day (which was great as it was HOT and humid). We walked to restaurants and to the metro with no problems. We will stay again...."
63,1362,"Jun 17 2005	More that happy to return	We stayed here for 4 nights while at the F1 Grand Prix.

Free bottle water &amp; fruit on offer all day in the lobby.Pleasent hotel bar to retrun too at night ! More than happy to return to hotel if I every come back to Montreal. As all Montreal hotels - cost more than normal that weekend due to the F1"
64,1362,"May 24 2005	I was very unhappy	In general I love the BW hotels. This one was easy to find. Centrally located. We asked for a quiet room, we got a room facing the street. Hotel has no parking, parking opposite charged CAD 17.50 add it to the price of the hotel and the deal is no deal. The room was tiny. We paid cash, gave the visa card as guarantee. Got back the visa slip the next day, found a month later that we have been debited for an extra CAD 12 and cannot get a reply why. Don't go there before you check all details."
65,1362,"Apr 20 2005	Depends on what you are looking for.	It really depends on the type of traveller you are. If you like to lounge in bed for many hours in the morning, watch movies...enjoy great room service etc.... this is NOT the hotel for you.This hotel is best suited for younger folks that will be spending very limited hours in the room. It's a great hotel just to put your head down at night and crash. The rooms are clean and humble, definately small. The hotel is definately safe.Probably the only reason I ever stayed at this place was when I was on a limited budget and wanted a place close to the action. There are 6 strip clubs less than 2 blocks from the hotel. A large number of really good fast food places serviing a variety of ethnic dishes, and the fabled Cresent street is only 2 streets west of the hotel.I do have to say the hotel bar is overpriced, and housekeeping takes forever if your room is higher than the 3rd floor.To summerize, you stay here for location and price. Not for luxury."

67,1362,"Apr 2 2005 	Unprepared hostile and a fire hazard.	While on a band trip with my school concert band and choir, we stayed in the Best Western Europa Hotel. After I was checked in we attempted to enter our rooms. Their card key system did not work. I needed to get our room keys (cards) reprogramed seven times on the first day, and many times later during our three night trip. The cleaner used in my rooms left a bad odor. Although some staff members were helpful, kind and a pleasure to talk to, others were not. Prank callers phoned in and asked for a wake up call at two in the morning for my room, and the reception desk called us at eleven thirty PM to confirm the call. After I said that I did not want a wake up call that early and that it must have been a prank call, the lobby told me that they could not prevent the call as it was already entered into the computer. (Why bother comfirming if they could not change it)? This happened again, but I found out about it (while going down to fix my room key) before it was entered. What I found most ensulting about this hotel was the security gaurd, who used told a client (also on my trip) to &quot;shut up&quot; also using profanities. The ice machines were all broken but one on the fifth floor, the second floor vending machine ate your money and had no &quot;out of order sign&quot;. All the other ones were unstocked on many things. The maids (who were very nice) seemed overworked. Worst of all, the hotel only had one flight of stairs that did not open into the lobby instead to an ally beside (this door had an alarm but no warning of one). Not only did this make the elevators extremely busy, but also if there was a fire in the ally that had spread into the north end of the hotel, there would be no escape route, as would there be none for the first floor if the lobby was ablaze. The lobby workers were not helpful in giving directions either."
68,1362,Dec 2 2004	Not as bad as everyone else thinks	As two young travelers we really enjoyed our stay at this best western. our room was exceptionally large and spacey. and the bathroom was actually a good size and had complimentary pantene pro v shampoo and dove body wash! the location of the hotel was great because it is right off of st. catherines str. the service was great and we arrived around noon and we were able to check in early with no problem. the staff was very kind and considerate but there was a little mix up with the hotel price which was taken care of quickly and with no problems!! at night when we would return we felt very safe since there was a security officer waiting to greet us and let us in. The only real problem we had was the price of parking which was $38 which is inconvenient since parking is usually free. also the windows should not be sealed shut. having fresh air would have been nice. All in all we had a great stay and would definitely stay there again!
69,1362,"Nov 6 2004	Not that bad - a bit odd	We had two nights here, and found the location excellent. The room was OK, and the high speed internet access worked fine (unlike another Best Western we stayed in). We disliked the lack of fresh air in the room - unable to open the windows or adjust the aircon to allow fresh air in.The public rooms are decorated on a theme of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne - distinctive, but not to my taste!The guy overseeing breakfasts was very friendly and helpful - other staff less so."
70,1362,"Oct 26 2004	Worst - We Renamed it 'The Cave'	For $139/night you and your partner can stay in a closet - the space was the smallest room we have ever encountered in our travels. Thus we upgraded to $159/night - we could both walk around the bed at the same time! However, the view of the brick wall did not change from that of the first room. Also, this was a smoking room, with no ventilation and windows that were sealed shut. By morning our throats and nostrils were burning. By the way, we bought a bottle of wine, no corkscrew in the room, no fridge for that matter. Front desk would not loan us the corkscrew and we had to bring the bottle down to them! This six story, poorly kept hotel is a definate no-no in Montreal or anywhere. There are many affordable places to stay in Montreal. We checked out first thing and moved to another hotel."
71,1362,"Oct 26 2004	Not recommended	Simple. I would just stay somewhere else. The room we stayed in felt dirty and cheap. The staff were horrendous in they way they treat you. i stayed at 5 hotels in Canda on my trip, 4 were Best westerns. This was by far the worst. They argued with me about charges, then the next day they were myseriously missing off the bill. the bell boy informed me i had to tip him, and when i informed the manager that i would decide when to tip someone, she replied that they do not do that sort of thing there. I hope she tells the bell boy. Looking around there were more than enough hotels in the area for the same price if not cheaper, so why take the risk."
72,1362,"Oct 21 2004	A bit hard	Felt compelled to give my opinion following the string of bad reviews , my wife and i felt the hotel offered reasonable rooms in an excellent location for bars,shopping etc. Rooms were clean though a little basic and maintained every day, tried the asian restaurant but didn't like it (maybe down to my taste as others loved it). Found reception staff efficient and courteous and found the locality safe for such a lively area."
73,1362,"Sep 9 2004	Location overrides everything else	This is the BEST location to stay if you're into shopping, nightlife, people watching at a cafe, walking around to the sights or anything else Montreal. St. Catherine is 50 feet from the front door! The cafes and clubs on Cresent are just two blocks away. The hotel was easy to get to driving into Montreal and parked across the street (although a little pricey but all parking is). Ok, the room was a little crampy and the bathroom door bumped into the towel rack so it didn't open all the way. But spending more time outside of the room than in, it didn't bother me. I was able to sneak a peak into other rooms with 2 queen beds and they were a lot larger. It may just depend on which room or suite you get stuck with. We had a room at the end of the corridor whichh probably helped with the layout of it. The hotel could use a face-lift but everything I saw was clean and the staff was friendly, even when a group of 10 were looking for a sight-seeing tour at the height of check-ins. Overall, I would stay here again to be in the middle of it all without shelling out a lot of money (need to save that for the shopping)."
74,1362,"Sep 4 2004	Looks good from the outside-looks can be deceiving	Previously stayed at the nearby Novotel (one block west and recommended) and decided to try this hotel-looked nice from the outside. Good location but small rooms with very small bathrooms, about the worst view I've ever come across, stained carpet in the corridors and not particularly helpful staff when we arrived early. On site restaurants were never tried (there are far better in the neighbourhood -try Chez Cora for breakfast -a couple of blocks east). Not a comfortable spot from which to enjoy exploring Montreal (our favourite city). Hotel was one of the reasons we cut our stay (in Montreal) short. Not recommended."
75,1362,"Sep 3 2004	It's not as bad as everyone seems to think	Honestly, it's not as bad as everyone seems to think. I've stayed here twice (in the summer of 2003 and 2004), had a great stay both times and will continue to stay here in the future. Yes, the room is small and the lobby is alittle on the modern medival/tacky side, but who comes to Montreal to hang out in their hotel room? It's reasonably priced, has an amazing location (near Crescent St., Ste. Catherine St., and the Metro) and incredible restaurants are always easy to find.The staff is also very friendly and helpful. You might get the odd person who speaks french and not much english, but you have to remember.... you're in Montreal, what do you expect?"
76,1362,"Aug 28 2004	Do not stay!!	I DO NOT recommend this hotel at all. The only good thing I have to say is that the location is great. My husband and I decided to stay here on their web deal of stay 2 nights and get the 3rd free. What it didn't say is that you'd have to fight with reception to get this deal. The lobby is VERY tacky looking. The room we stayed in was appaulingly small. The bathroom is so small that you literally had to hang your feet into the bathtub to use the washroom. They also have no parking and no parking recommendations for you. For 3 nights we ended up having to pay $51 for parking. The hotel restaurant is Japanese only so if your not into that, then your screwed.Overall, I found the whole experience terrible, the staff not friendly at all and even though everything appeared clean, it felt very dirty."

1,1367,BED BUGS ALERT!!!	Awful place to stay as I encountered BED BUGS and brought them home with me. Myself and friend have awful bites all over our arms/hands and back...If you actually choose to stay here check your head board for mites...ours was literally INFESTED. Most disgusting thing i've ever seen.
2,1367,"Oct 26 2009 	Not the best	This hotel was nice in its day, but is now quite worn. The room appeared fairly clean, but the furniture was old and stained, the curtains were falling off the rod on one side, the hand lotion in the bathroom was half empty and had not been replaced, and the only treadmill in the exercise room was broken. The decaf coffee was never replaced during my stay, and with only one or two attendants, the front desk was always too busy to wait to ask for more. On the positive side: the location was fairly convenient, only a few blocks from the Metro, the free internet was fast, and the room had a large walk-in closet."
3,1367,"Sep 30 2009 	Cannot fault this hotel for comfort or value.	Our experience here was excellent. We spent a week here, our first visit to Montreal (and Canada), on the 24th floor, in a very nicely furnished and coordinated suite, with a fully equipped kitchen, a sizeable suite with dining area and a big balcony with a fantastic view towards Mont Royal. It was nice to have the kitchen facilities for breakfast or supper. The room was high enough to escape any traffic noise, but it's not too busy a thoroughfare anyway. Close to a metro station too, which is handy. The rooms are well insulated for sound - we never heard the neighbours, even though they had a baby with them! The laundry facilities in the basement are absolutely fine, cheap and easy to use, too. We found the service to be faultless and friendly, too; the front desk staff were very helpful. The place was spotless. We think that the people who have submitted poorer reviews must just have been unlucky. We know a good hotel when we see it as we travel extensively in Europe. We were comfortable and happy here and would try to book here again, when we return to Montreal, which we certainly will. This hotel contributed to a brilliant holiday in Montreal."
4,1367,"Sep 25 2009 	Good value if your expectations are clear.	Stayed in room 2209 for two nights in September with friends to see the city and do some shopping. Some of the reviews on Trip Advisor made me leery about staying. However, the property is located easy walking distance from shopping and restaurants. The neighbourhood is safe. The rooms are dated, basic, but do include a small kitchenette which is convenient. The parking garage is dark, but that is standard for and old city like Montreal.I would not stay here if the hotel was the most important part of your stay, but for a weekend with friends, on the cheap (we payed $89 per night) - it is a good value."
5,1367,"Sep 8 2009 	Worst hotel and service ever... especially for honeymooners!	My wife and I decided to come to Montreal for our honeymoon to keep our Canadian dollars where they belong but have it seem like we were in another country with the French langauge... We chose the Clarion because in the photos and description it looked wonderful! Well I have you know, the photos are NOTHING to what they are cracked up to be... Our 10 day honeymoon turned into a 2-night stay and we had to get out. We had a dear friend/hotel agent set everything up for us.. It was to be a honeymoon suite all jazzed up with roses and wine and the whole nine yards.. Upon our arrival, they didnt have a room ready for us until the NEXT night, so we settled for less at our expense.. The next morning we told front desk we were ready to check out and check back in for our &quot;honeymoon suite&quot; in which he replied &quot;you dont just want to keep the same room?&quot; .. I thought it must have been a joke but after some words were exchanged we got our upgrade which was planned to begin with... This room was a so nice and big and fancy, but ofcourse there was no roses and wine and everything as ordered. Being the romantic I am, I decided to prepare for a meal that I would make for my new wife in the kitchenette included with the room... Every dish or utensil had food caked all over it! It is the clients responsibility to keep the kitchenette cleaned to prevent a $25 fee but its evident that the cleaners dont do their job! I immediately took it to front desk and they didnt have time to replace it because they only ever have one person working at a time.. So she called a handy-man of some sort.. he came to our room and said &quot;I really have no time for this, you're just gonna have to clean them yourself&quot; .. I thought for sure this must be a joke but yet again we had to exachange some words and we eventually got clean dishes.. I don't know what they do to the employees at this hotel but they are the most miserable inconsiderate people I have ever encountered in customer service.. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again and I hope if this hasnt changed your mind about Clarion that you enjoy your time!"
6,1367,"Sep 7 2009 	Great location	First time at this hotel and the location was great for shopping, nightlife and the metro, all were in walking distance. The hotel was clean and the room was clean and spacious. However, speaking on the room I must say they need upgraded beds and pillows. They were probably the most uncomfortable bed in a hotel that I have slept in. The room we stayed in had a kitchenette and was a great idea as the fridge and microwave came in handy."
7,1367,"Aug 21 2009 	The hotel is clean and inexpensive but...	This is probably a known party hotel. The rooms are large and inexpensive and the hotel itself is huge. To its credit, there was a concert in town, but reading some of the other reviews, it seems like this happens often. We were woken up several times during the night by the rooms around us. Upon check-in, there was an issue with my room rate which was never resolved but it wasn't a huge issue for me. The front desk staff was less than friendly including the supervisor. She seemed to become a bit nicer later on and the next morning. The staff did not seem very confident and probably needed some more training. The room was clean and the hotel was fairly close to some decent attractions. The free internet was appreciated. This is why I gave it an average rating (and not less). I would not stay here again if I were going to spend time exploring Montreal. For one night, it served its purpose."
8,1367,"Aug 14 2009 	Didn't sleep that night	The hotel has fair price and good location in quite street near downtown , The building looks good yet checking in took some time bcz 1 employee was working at 7pm on 26/6/2009 . The room is OK but the gaz was broken and 2 other stuff werent in good shape but it wasn't a big issue .HOWEVER as of midnight there was shouting all over the hotel with teenagers screaming and talking in the corridors and people fighting among each other .WE called reception but no one answered . We were afraid to leave the room bcz of all the drunk young people going around banging on the doors and saying obscene words .This fiasco lasted up to 5am and the police were called in 6 times .The next day we checked out bcz that is no place for families or for people who want to have a good night sleep .The hotel slogan &quot;Satisfaction guaranteed or you money back &quot; is one big lie .We moved to Residence Inn (Mariott) accross the street which was better , cleaner , safer , &amp; cheaper ."
9,1367,"Aug 7 2009 	Great Experience and Hope More Feel the Same	Wow... Maybe I got lucky, or maybe some people expected a 5-star resort for $90 a night, but I have NO idea why this hotel reeived so many negative reviews.My wife and I were in Montreal for four days, and we were very satisfied with our stay. We booked a king bed suite and actually got a suite (not just a big room with a couch in it). It seems like the hotel was once an apartment complex with an upper and lower landing. On the upper landing was a mini-kitchen, the bathroom, a walk-in closet, and a dining area. On the lower landing was the bed as well as a desk and bureau with TV.The bathroom was adequate and clean. The kitchen had a full stove, fridge, and enough silverware and plates to cook dinner for two. It even had a cake pan! The closet was so big, you could hold our bags and seven or eight stowaways if necessary (no... really). The dining nook was nice for those nights we decided to eat in.The bed was comfortable, the TV worked just fine, and the desk was a perfect place to set up the laptop. The wi-fi was a little slow at times but always worked. The lower landing also had a balcony, that was far from decorative but a great place to bring out a chair and read the newspaper or wind down with a beer. We never turned on the A/C opting instead to open up a vent near the sliding glass door for a cool breeze on the 21st floor.As for the parking, I can't comment because we didn't have a car in Montreal. Montreal is such a pedestrian-friendly city it makes no sense to rent a car and park it in any garage (cramped or not) for $20 or $30 a day. The Clarion is located within three blocks of TWO metro stations, and is only about 6 blocks from the Crescent district. St. Catherine's street is one block to the north, so you are always near restaurants, shops, and grocery stores. The neighborhood is a little run down, but what do you expect for a 90-year-old neighborhood? We never felt threatened day or night by our surroundings. The front desk was occasionally busy (the lobby is small) but I waited maybe 10 minutes to check in and had an immediate check out. And as for the elevators, for crying out loud people... if you don't like the elevators take the friggin' stairs. See how &quot;bad&quot; the elevators are as you're huffing and puffing while going up 20 flights of stairs. Better yet, use the gym on the first floor (a gem in the building).Overall, I would recommend this hotel for young couples who don't mind a little walk to a Metro station or cooking up a store-bought pizza in the oven instead of spending $50 at a restaurant. If you want a 5-star hotel, go to Le Centre Sheraton. If you want a nice hotel with a gorgeous view of Mount Royal from your balcony for about $90 a night, than this is the place for you."
10,1367,"Jul 26 2009 	Great location	It doesn't take alot for me to be happy with a hotel. I bascially like a good price, great location, and cleanliness. I travel with the idea that I'm there to see the city, and the hotel is just a place to sleep in. That said, I was impressed with the Clarion, despite reading bad reviews. Most places around are within walking distance. Room was clean, free internet was great, kitchen was a nice plus. Would definitely stay here again. Only bad thing for me was the hot tub was under construction during my stay, which was disappointing. You definitely do not need a car when visiting Montreal."
11,1367,"Jul 5 2009 	Unsatisfactory Service And All-Night Partying At The Clarion Montreal	We recently stayed at the Clarion Hotel on Boulevard de Maissoneuve for three nights (June 25-28) and were very disappointed with the quality of service provided by this establishment. While we had a satisfactory stay at this location one year ago, we feel we must give this hotel an unsatisfactory rating on this occasion. A negative check-in experience on our first day in Montreal was followed the next day by the night from hell as we were subjected to all-night partying by underage teenagers. The hotel was ill-prepared to deal with this situation and should be very embarrassed about its reputation . While we did receive some compensation from the hotels front desk manager, we feel that we must comment on our experience at this hotel because there are customer service issues, security concerns and major concerns for guest safety that must be addressedUpon check-in on June 25 at 5:45 p.m., the gentleman checking us in was not successful in getting my American Express card to swipe through the electronic credit card reader. Two different machines were tried. It was a recently-activated card but Id already used the card twice to purchase gasoline in two different cities and it worked flawlessly. I asked the receptionist to call American Express to see if there was a problem with the card and he refused. I called American Express on my cellular telephone and they informed me that the card was valid and that the hotel should call their hotline (a 1-800 number) and ask for a verification code on the card. The receptionist refused to do this saying that if the card couldnt be swiped, it was no good. I then called the desk supervisor over and she also indicated that the hotel could not accept the card if it would not swipe. She also refused to call the credit card company to verify the card. The supervisor did try the card again and was successful in getting it to swipe after her second try.We certainly started out on the wrong foot at the Clarion and this hotel should be embarrassed to have such an incompetent staff manning the front desk. That a modern-day hotel would not have a way of manually entering a credit card number and verifying its validity is something that we find quite incredible and unacceptable. We used the credit card several times in Montreal at various restaurants and without problems or incidents during our stay.On Friday, June 26, we came back to our room (#412) at 4:00 p.m. and found sheets covering the hallway outside our room. We wondered what was going on as we hadnt been informed by the front desk that any maintenance work was being performed on this date. My wife, who is handicapped, uses a wheelchair and the sheets made it extremely difficult to manouvre the wheelchair in the hallway. At 9:00 p.m. (five hours later), I approached the receptionist at the front desk and asked why the sheets were there. She informed me that the carpets had been cleaned that day and that the sheets were there to protect the carpets. I asked if the sheets could be removed from the hall and was told that people would be called to remove the sheets shortly. At 10:30, I called down to the receptionist again and she indicated that the sheets would not be removed until the morning. Please note that at no time, either when our booking was made or upon checking in, were we informed of any maintenance work to be performed at the hotel. That the hotel would not have closed this floor off for this type of maintenance is unconscionable. I also checked on several other floors and observed that sheets had been placed on those floors as well. Later on that evening, we realized that the carpets had not been cleaned and that the sheets were, in fact, placed there to protect the carpets in the hallway from all-night underage partygoers.After 10:00 pm on June 25, we became aware that the Clarion on rue de Maissoneuve in Montreal, Quebec had been targeted for a noisy, all-night, teenage after-prom party. Several complaints to the front desk drew little and very ineffective responsive action. The front desk claimed to be dealing with the problem but seemed content to have their regular, law-abiding guests accept the chaotic situation.The following infractions of unacceptable conduct were observed: Partying in halls and rooms More guests in the rooms than allowed under the fire safety code Excessively loud music Youngsters banging on doors in the middle of the night Loud groups on balconies Smoking on non-smoking floors in rooms, balconies and in corridors and stairwells Shouting and loud swearing Underage drinking Beer and liquor bottles/cans left in the hallways, stairwells and elevators Condom box left on the floor of one of the elevators Hash/marijuana found in stairwell All-night noiseIt was blatantly apparent that this Clarion Hotel was understaffed during the night as our calls to the front desk went unanswered. The line to the front desk rang repeatedly for well over one-hundred rings following repeated tries and there was no response from anyone at the front desk when we tried to call hotel staff. In effect, the front desk could not respond to any safety concerns at night because the hotel is so short-staffed. My wife is handicapped and if the hotel was so ill-equipped to handle loud party-goers, we wonder how this establishment would handle a medical emergency or a fire emergency (perhaps from a teenager smoking in a bed). There is a major concern as the disabled room is located on the fourth floor. Should a fire occur, the elevator would be out of service and I would be unable to get my wife down to safety unaided. Note that, in fact, the elevator did appear to be out of service in the middle of the night. It is obvious that any emergency situation that might occur in this hotel would result in a disaster beyond anyones imagination.The morning following the partying, the corridors, stairwells and elevators resembled a war zone. This mess remained throughout the hotel for most of the day and the establishment only had one caretaking employee charged with cleaning the corridors for the entire building. Where the prom partying took place on Friday evening, the corridors were still not completely cleaned and no vacuuming had been done. This clearly highlights this hotels severe understaffing, once again and demonstrates that the hotel staff is ill prepared to deal with any type of emergency situation that might come along.I spoke with the front desk manager on Saturday, June 27. Many other guests had complained about the noise and rowdiness in the hotel during the night on Friday. This manager did agree to refund the cost of one nights stay to us. While we did appreciate this gesture, it was a very small one considering the unacceptable conduct of the teenage guests on Friday night and the unacceptable level of service the hotel provided (or did not provide) to deal with emergencies. The manager made excuses for the low level of service, blaming everything on staff cutbacks. When asked if there were security cameras in the hallways, he stated that cameras were only present in the front lobby area and none were present in the hallways because those were not allowed under Quebec law. We know, in fact, that cameras are allowed in hallways in Montreal because we checked with one of the competing popular hotel chains in the city and their facilities have cameras in all their corridors and in all public areas.Because security and safety are such a concern in this hotel, we are making the following recommendations: Increasing the number of front desk personnel (particularly at night). Currently, only one staff member is assigned to the night shift. Security card access for guests to use the elevators A night security guard dedicated to patrolling the hallways to ensure that order is maintained Security cameras installed in the all corridors, stairwells, front lobby and parking garage. These should be equipped with video recording devices Enforcing the legal numbers of guests allowed to occupy a roomWe do not believe that this establishment would pass a government inspection or a Canadian Automobile Association Inspection following our experience there over our brief stay. For that reason, we have launched complaints with Choice Hotels, The Quebec Government and the Canadian Automobile Association. Hopefully the hotel management will acknowledge the problems we have addressed and take some action."
12,1367,"May 25 2009 	never ever ever again!	This hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The balcony door fell off the track and onto the balcony when I tried to open it. The concierge moved us to a suite, which was just a bigger version of our ugly old room. The bathrooms are extremely tiny with no room to move. The other people staying in the hotel were loud, rude, and slamming doors all night. The night concierge was EXTREMELY unhelpful. This hotel over -sold their parking garage, leaving my business partner and I stranded in montreal with nowhere to park our car at 1:30 in the morning. We complained only to be told &quot; there was nothing they could do&quot;Not finding parking until 3:30 in the morning was an awful end to an awful stay in the Clarion. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody."
13,1367,"Nov 19 2008 	Horrible experience	I stayed at this hotel with another couple. I WAS HORRIFIED WITH THE EXPERIENCE WE HAD.After we were refunded for our room because of our experience, THE MANAGER CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD THREE (3) TIMES OVER---WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.Our experience included:-dirty soiled underwear in the lobby washroom-45 minute wait for elevators-dirty bed sheets-a manager who said they would call me back, then dodged my calls for - going on three weeks now.-noise complaints-dirty hot tub-no parking-a general manager who wouldn't listen to our complaints and was more interested in charging my credit card illegally, ***DO NOT USE THIS HOTEL. YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY!-It totally ruined our Montreal experience, and one month later I am still trying to get this sorted with lawyers my credit card company, and the GM who is a flake."
14,1367,"Oct 18 2008 	Very nice hotel	I cannot quite understand the many negative reviews this hotel has gotten, as we had a very pleasant experience here.We had not booked in advance but i had made a mental note in regards to the very competitive pricing, and checking in on a Thursday evening without reservations was not a problem, neither was extending our stay for Friday. The people at the front desk were friendly and knowledgeable about the area.Our room was on the 20th floor, fairly spacious and very clean, with a comfortable queen sized bed, a full kitchen with even a real stove and enough dishes, glassware and utensils to prepare a simple meal for two. We also had a terrace which offered a nice view over Mont Royal.Having read previous reviews I was prepared for a long wait at the elevators but during the 2 days of our stay we never had to wait longer than 2 minutes even during the morning check out rush and on most occasions an elevator arrived within 30 seconds. There was some wait at the front desk however, which with only two attendants and an excessively ringing phone seemed somewhat understaffed.We were charged a rate of $107 plus tax per night, which was a lot cheaper than downtown hotels closer to the center of town, which were asking for $200 and up. Parking cost extra (I believe it was $15 per day) and I do agree that the garage is small and it takes some maneuvering to get around, but we did not encounter any major problems with our mid-sized SUV.There are lots of restaurants, supermarkets and shopping centers close by, and the closest metro station lies only 2 blocks away.An overall very satisfying experience and I would stay here again without hesitation."
15,1367,"Oct 6 2008 	This hotel is awful - don't even consider staying here	This past weekend I had the misfortune of staying at the Clarion Hotel at 2100 de Maisonneuve Montreal, QC. My experience was so terrible I believe that it is important for other travellers to be aware of the horrible conditions I experienced and the incompetent staff I had to deal with during my stay.I had booked a room with two double beds for four travellers. Upon arrival, I discovered that I was given a room with one double bed. I complained to the clerk at front desk, who was unconcerned at first and told me that there was little he could and that I could lodge a formal complaint in the morning. I had to tell him that this was unacceptable and I demanded that I be given the room I reserved so that there would be enough space for everyone to sleep. He finally agreed to call the manager and asked us to wait in the current  but too small room.Unfortunately, when we were waiting we discovered that the room we were given was not only too small, but also did not have electricity. After calling front desk, someone from maintenance came to the room. We tried to explain the problem, but he could not speak either French or English. After flipping the light switches he mumbled no power me back, shrugged his shoulders. He left and didnt come back. We complained again, to no avail. After sitting in the dark for about an hour we were finally given a new room. This room did not have two double beds, but it had a bed and a sofa bed and was apparently the last room available in the hotel. Conceding that it was better than a single bed we agreed to take it for the night.When we arrived in the room it was filthy, musty, and stinky. The walls had grime on it, the floor had chip crumbs, the sheets had holes, there were no pillows, and the bathroom was mouldy and in disrepair. The sofa bed had no support and it was more comfortable to put the mattress on the floor. Since it was all that was available we made due and had an uncomfortable night.The next day, we complained again and changed to a new room that actually had two double beds, was fairly clean, and did not smell. Unfortunately it did not have face cloths, and when we asked for them they never came. We called three times to get face cloths, but our request was ignored. Finally, an hour and a half later, someone came with a bath towel. But they could not speak English or French and did not understand us when we said that it wasnt what we needed.When I checked out the next day, I had to wait an hour since the hotel staff was slow and did not have an automatic check out system like most major hotels use. Regardless, we needed to talk to the staff because there was a card in the room that stated that if we were not satisfied with our stay we were entitled to a free night stay. When I finally got to check out, I asked the clerk for the discount and he LAUGHED AT ME! We spoke to the manager, who didnt take our complaints seriously, but offered us $60 off our bill anyway. We were so upset we just took the small discount that was offered and left so that we could be rid of the horrible experience and bad treatment.The Clarion Hotel was by far the worst hotel Ive ever stayed at and I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone stay at this hotel unless they want to ruin their stay in the beautiful city of Montreal."
16,1367,"Sep 18 2008 	Hated It	I've stayed at the Clarion between 09/15-09/18 and had some good and bad experiences.Good:Having your own kitchen is definitely a plus. Cooking a light meal and eat it at your leisure makes me feel like home. I stayed in the Junior suites and had plenty of room to place my luggages, bags etc...Bad:I think the clearning crew must've been very lazy or they get paid somewhat a low wage. Bathroom: It's cleaned everyday BUT there are rooms for improvement. I walked into the bathroom one day and noticed a price tag I threw away into the basket bin earlier in the morning is now in the toilet. The cleaning person obviously didn't flush the toilet or else he/she'd noticed there's a piece of paper in there.Bed: It's made everyday BUT I noticed they just threw the extra pillow on the cover. It looks like someone was in a hurry and didn't bother placing it in its proper place.Misc:I don't think they really clean everything in that room during my stay. I noticed there was a strind of hair on my bedside table and my lotion bottle was knocked down one day when I got back to the suite.Elevators:There are 2 elevetors in the building. I didn't have to wait for long to go up to my floor. BUT going down was a different story. Unless you leave the hotel at 7amish, you'll have to wait 5-10 mins for an elevator. I got so fed up during the rest of my stay that I just took the stairs and walked to the main floor.One night I was waiting for the elevators on the main floor. There was a cleaning person changing the bags in the garbage bins. I assumed the bag has a hole or maybe something fell out from the bin. The person sweared right there in front of me. Although he was swearing loudly in a different language but it just so happened that I understand what he was saying. I gave him a look and then quickly hopped into the elevator.Check Out:There was one person working at reception in the morning. Everyday I passed by the desk, I'd see a queue waiting to checkout. I had to wait 25 mins to check out at 7:45am. The management should know better to place more people at Reception. The lady who was serving didn't get help until 8:10am. She had to multi tasks between people checking out, answer telephone calls and people 'dropping by' to leave things for her. etc.. etc...Maybe I am a picky person. Hence I'm noticing all these little things. But overall i don't think I'll come back to this place again."
17,1367,"Sep 3 2008 	Great deal - Recommend it!	I was last minute making reservations, TripAdvisor was a big help but I ran into too many 'not availables' so I asked AAA to find something and they got me a reservation at the Clarion Hotel &amp; Suites. We had a great room - a suite for only $124 CAD / night - with queen size bed, living room with pull out sofa (my 16 year old son was travelling with me so that gave us each a little privacy), 2 TVs, decently equipped kitchen, bathroom, and kitchen table area. We were on the 15th floor which had awesome views from both the living room and the bedroom with windows that opened! I read in Trip Advisor that we may not get parking in the garage and that turned out to be true. We wanted to park indoors since my daughter's stuff had to stay in the car a few days so we parked at the Pepsi Forum only 2 blocks away. It worked out great! You could park right out front for 15 min. to unload/load. Parking is not good anywhere in Montreal in my experience - neither inexpensive, roomy, nor easy to access. I recommend the higher floors because of the elevators. We did have to wait for an elevator going up, but never going down, but we did pass by the lower floors where people couldn't get on because it was already full. My key needed to be replaced but that did not turn out to be much of an inconvenience at all. Only other downside, the internet service was not reliable.But if you are on a budget, not in a hurry, and want to enjoy Montreal, I highly recommend it! Its near shopping, movies, groceries, metro, and restaurants.In the last 4 years, this is the 3rd hotel I've stayed in downtown and my favorite so far!"
18,1367,"Sep 1 2008 	Great Experience	We booked the summer special, stay the first two nights, and the third night is half price and breakfasts are included. Breakfast is two eggs, your choice of sausage or bacon, toast, juice, coffee or tea. The room is upgraded to an executive suite and it was very clean and comfortable. Fully equipped kitchen, separate bedroom, great air conditioning, bathroom is a little dated, but again clean and comfortable. All the staff were great and very helpful. Two blocks to the subway, but you can walk anywhere. Grocery store around the corner, and good shopping on St. Catharine Street. The BEST restaurant was Enzo's on Crescent Street. The food was excellent, the prices were very reasonable, and the staff was amazing. They will make you things that are not even on the menu! If you are visiting Montreal, you must dine here!"
19,1367,"Aug 30 2008 	Stay away	We decided to stay at Clarion because it generally enjoys a good reputation and was close to many of the attrations we wanted to visit. Upon arrival, we found that they charged a $200 security deposit, that was not advertised on the webiste, also $16/night for parking that was not advertised. The parking was in an undergroud lot, that barely accommodated the size of our Jeep Liberty. There was not enough room to pass another car in the garage, so you just held your breath and hoped you would not meet another car on the way. Breakfast was not included in the price of the room, unless you bought a &quot;special package;&quot; then the breakdown of room charges showed $10 each for breakfast that included 2 small eggs, 2 undercooked strips of bacon or sausage, two pieces of toast and a tiny glass of orange juice. The room itself was relatively clean, but on the shelf in the coat closet, we found shirt that belonged to a former occupant, sitting on a few layers of dust. The bed was hard and they only had feather pillows, a nightmare for 2 people who suffer from allergies. Most hotels today include free local calls, so we made a few over the time we stayed and on checkout found that they charge $1 for every call--also not advertised. Two elevators for 26 floors meant a wait every time you wanted to use one. The front desk girls were less than helpful and barely spoke English, we had difficutly getting them to understand most of what we were saying. Overall, I would no go back here. There were many hotels all around, pick one of them."
20,1367,"Aug 27 2008 	Avoid this hotel if possible	The only good thing about this hotel is its location. Everything else is just bad:- There are only 2 elevators (not enough for 21-floor hotel) and they are slow, so there's a constant line-up, a few of times we had to wait for 10-15 minutes- Rooms are not clean. My gf have found a hair and some dirt on the wall of the bathtub, the carpets were dusty, and the bed cover was not washed probably for a year.- Receptionists are rude, and completely useless (don't even bother to ask them anything).- They save even on shampoo and soap: there were not enough supplies for 2 of us for the whole period, and they didn't bother to bring any more.- Hotel website says it has a &quot;spa tub&quot;. But in fact it's a small, smelly (chlorine plus stale water) and quite dirty pool of water, hotel employees are walking around it in their street shoes. I have never seen anyone use it.In short: stay away from this hotel, there're plenty of better places in Montreal"
21,1367,"Aug 22 2008 	Okay Stay at the Clarion	In my opinion, the reviews on this site are a bit harsh. I found the room to be clean and spacious- we had a suite. I thought the location was close to the subway-we were there for the Montreal Jazz Festival. The center of town is about a 20-30 min walk away which was great for us to stretch our legs.I will agree that the elevators were slow and should be updated. I would also agree that the parking garage is very dangerous and also needs to be updated. Overall, I think the hotel is fine for the money spent unless we just got lucky."
22,1367,"Aug 16 2008 	A little puzzled by some of the terrible reviews	My wife and I booked an executive suite through Expedia.ca for Aug. 14 and 15 and paid about $105 a night. For this we got a clean, fairly spacious one-bedroom apartment with a kitchen that had wine glasses, crockery, a few pots and pans -- enough to do some simple cooking. We also had a pretty good sized balcony.As others have noted, the small lobby and the two elevators are a bit of a problem, but we managed to get checked in and checked out without too much of a wait. The wifi was free, and worked fine.The Clarion is not exactly overflowing with staff (I think during our visit there was just one person at reception at all times. The woman who checked us in seemed to be juggling about seven things at once, but she did it exceedingly well, and service was courteous. We had to park about a block and a half down the street at a private lot, but that's because we didn't book parking in advance. The fee at the private lot was surprisingly modest -- $12 for both days.The only real glitch was that when we returned, exhausted, at the end of the second day, neither of our key cards worked. But the front desk fixed this immediately. The place seemed fairly busy, but we were not awakened at 2 a.m. by noisy drunks as we were a few weeks earlier at a more upscale Montreal hotel. All in all, I'd describe the Clarion as pretty good value for the money."
23,1367,"Aug 5 2008 	Do NOT stay here	My wife and stayed at this hotel on Sunday August 3, to get things started we are both very familiar with Montreal and have stayed at dozens of hotels in Montreal. Seeing that our trip was coming to an end and we wanted to break our drive up a bit we decided to stay the night in Montreal and head home the next day... We didnt have access to the internet but I always keep hotels.ca number handy on my cell. We called them and booked a somewhat cheap hotel ($150 for a sunday night) as we didnt want to spent too much money, hotels.ca rated the hotel a 3 star so we figured we were safe! geez was I wrong, as soon as we checked in my wife decided she did want to stay here so we tried to check out right away. Which was impossible without losing $150 (somewhat understandable). The staff was pretty good to us and offered us a different room on higher floor which was a bit cleaner but still digusting. I will never stay at this hotel again for the following reasons:Location: although it isnt that far from the action the area doesnt seem the safestRooms: are so outdated and dirty (I wouldn't let my 17 brother stay there even to party) Elevators: seem like they haven't been serviced since the hotel was built and there is only 2 for 20 floors... 10 - 15 minute waitParking: don't even bother parking your car there If i could give this hotel a minus rating I would. Stay at the Four Points, or Delta $10 more a night but a world of difference"
24,1367,"Jul 20 2008 	Disgusting rude guests staff and conditions.	The Clarion in Montreal takes the cake for the most disgusting establishment I have ever stayed at. My boyfriend and I drove from Ottawa into Montreal to finish our Canadian vacation in the fall and poorly chose this place to stay because of its somewhat affordable rate. We could hardly drive on the street due to construction, and parking was an utter mess -- the garage is a hazard in every way, with a one-way circular ramp into the garage and low ceilings with poor lighting.The room was as clean as one would hope for; we only had marginal issues with the actual room. We were exhausted from driving and because of the hotel's inconvenient location and frightening garage we chose not to venture far; when we sat down to eat at the restaurant the waitress walked over and pretty much told us the food at the hotel was horrible and suggested we find somewhere else to eat...we ended up finding a pretty nice place down the street.Apparently the same night we were staying there, an entire high school group was staying in the same general wing of the hotel (though not sure if they were on our floor or elsewhere). The shouting and banging and hollering never stopped. Our phone rang off the hook with prank calls and random French messages. We complained multiple times, and we told that other people had also complained, and nothing was done. We heard a front desk person tell these loud guests to shut up many times, to no avail.Anyway, there were two nights of this insanity, and we were glad to get out. The entire experience was horrid and disgusting -- the area, the hotel, the staff unwilling to do anything to shield good guests from rude ones; I wrote Clarion HQ a letter with a very detailed complaint and they basically sent me an e-mail to tell me there was nothing they can do -- great customer service, huh? We'll never go back there, and if you are reading this, the reviews should speak for themselves...this hotel is horrible. I would've rather slept in my car."
25,1367,"May 20 2008 	Worst Night's Sleep Ever	This is NOT a Hotel... it is more of a rooming house full of very inconsiderate guests! My husband and I stayed here to avoid staying with relatives on the long weekend but ended up being woken up BOTH nights by drunkards trying to get into our room and their own! The walls are paper thin, people seem to live there on a weekly/monthly basis and yell down the halls at all hours of the night, the doors have a horrible closing mechanism that echos down the hall and the hotel had no parking available. I did not get any sleep, not only because of the noise but also the beds were so hard I might as well have been sleeping on the floor and the pillows were very very lumpy and thin. Do yourselves a favor and stay at a hostel, this place is the WORST hotel I've ever been in."
26,1367,"Apr 20 2008	Absolutely disgusting	Absolutely Disgusting? - Jon? - TodayI have never seen such a fiasco in my life. We booked and had written confirmation for two rooms for April 19, 2008, the Saturday night of the UFC '83. Upon our arrival we discovered that the hotel was majorly over booked. They had up to 4 reservations per room. The first people to arrive were given their room only to go out for a few hours and return to find their keys no longer worked and someone else was in their room. Other less fortunates like ourselves were just left with no room and absolutely no where to stay in Montreal. The staff didn't even bother to try to locate another hotel for these people. We were just screwed and left to drive back to Toronto after the fight. Too bad the worst rating you can give this hotel is poor."
27,1367,Sep 20 2007	Fancy a Wait for Lifts	Stayed here as part of a Tour Party and found the hotel to be not as bad as some of the reviews posted on here unless of course we were lucky. The rooms were big and the kitchen area was small but lets be honest who goes to Montreal on holiday to spend a lot of time in the room - the beds were clean and comfortable and the room intself was large - What has been said about the lifts is true - we waited about 10 mins one day for them and most of the time I walked up and down the stairs (fortunately we were on on the 8th floor :-) ) The bar is poor though we went for a drink about 10.30 one night and it had ran out of draught lager and wine and the service was pretty slow. The breakfast we had one morning was fine and reasonable priced. The area the hotel was in was not the best but I never felt overly threatened and its more central than some of said - only about a 10 minute walk to the Crescent which is an area full of bars and restaurants. Overall I would say this hotel is not the best but dont know technically how much we paid for it as it was all included in the tour price
28,1367,"Sep 6 2007 	I would warn all away from this hotel	This WAS a nice hotel years ago, called the Manoir LeMoyne. It seems that Clarion has taken it over and driven it down into nothing more that a dump with drug users yelling all through the night.Rather than write out a terribly long narrative, here is a long list of why we won't go back:Small bathroomFan did not workShower door not attached properlyDrawers did not open and close properlyHair dryer did not operate for more than 1 minute (alternate I had blew circuit)KitchenDrawers did not open and close properlyDishes were dirty in the cupboardMain AreaAir vents were filthyWallpaper peeling, with moldy looking walls behindDining area chair torn and frayedSofa and chair stainedLarge BathroomDoor did not functionVery low water pressureSpa jets did not workI have to agree wholeheartedly with the negative reviews.Oh, and this was the &quot;Presidential Suite&quot;. We needed more beds and thought it would be a nice splurge. They wanted $300/night."
29,1367,"Sep 4 2007 	Don't Stay here	First of all we requested 2 rooms next to eachother with pullout couches. The person on the phone said this would not be a problem, but when we got in our rooms were 17 floors apart and no couch in either or them. The 17 floors wouldn't have been a big deal if you didn't have to wait for the elevators for so long. Having no couches was a problem seeming how there were 7 of us for 2 beds. They gave us rooms 13 floors apart on the second night that at least had couches after we complained. Trust me the rooms are crappy so the hassle wasn't worth it. Also, It is a good distance away from the action. I mean it is walkable, but if you are staying at this hotel you are probably going for the bars and you are going to get drunk so the walk was a bit longer than I wanted. The funniest part of the hotel experience was when we asked where the ice machines were and the front desk person told us if we wanted ice we could go to the store to buy it.Do not stay here no matter how cheap of a hotel you want."
30,1367,"Aug 22 2007 	Sheets not changed wait for elevator unsafe garage	Perhaps I should start with the positives before I get to the negatives. My friends and I stayed at the Clarion Hotel the weekend of August 18, 2007. We stayed in an Executive suite which includes a bedroom with a queen sized bed and a sofa bed in the living room. There is a TV in both rooms. The fridge and microwave in the kitchen came in very handy for midnight snacks. It is located quite close to shopping on St. Catherines (10 minute walk) and it's about a 20 minute walk to trails up Mount Royal.At first glance the hotel seemed decent, but we soon found something VERY disturbing. Underneath the pillow lay an old t-shirt! Unless Clarion has started a complimentary pyjama service, we were certain that it did not belong there, nor did it belong to any of us. We informed reception of the situation - that the sheets were not changed - and they sent one fresh pillow and sheet. However, the presence of the t-shirt is an obvious indicator that the entire bed was not changed and so we had to call reception again to request a second pillow and sheet. Despite the fact that the situation was corrected, it did not restore our confidence in the housekeeping practices at this hotel. The manager was reluctant to compensate us. At first she claimed that &quot;the sheets are definitely clean&quot; as housekeeping cleans them every day. We had to argue this because it is clear that anything left in the bed means that it was not cleaned properly. She ended up giving us complimentary parking (a savings of $35 off a bill of ~$420 for 2 nights). She claimed that because we had pre-paid with Hotels.ca she couldn't do anything else.Even if the sheets were clean, we still would not go back to this hotel. The elevator, as mentioned on another review, is ancient. The hotel has only 2 elevators which has a maximum capacity of 8 persons each which services over 20 floors. We waited almost 10 minutes for an elevator that wasn't full, and this occured on many occassions.Finally, the underground parking garage was simply unsafe. It is extremely cramped, making parking for vehicles larger than sedans quite challenging, if not impossible. Also, the ramps were narrow but also 2-way. There are no signs indicating 2-way traffic and accidents could easily occur if someone wasn't looking around the corner, as there were no convex mirrors either. To exit the garage, you have to swipe your card at the bottom of the exit ramp. As we were leaving, the garage door began to close and we had to break in avoid being hit! We had to reverse the car down the steep ramp to open the door again. Seeing as how we drove up the exit ramp at an acceptable speed, this is completely unacceptable. If you are considering a stay in Montreal, definitely look elsewhere first, unless you don't expect to drive there, take the elevator to the 20th floor, or sleep in clean sheets."
31,1367,"Aug 19 2007 	Noisy!	We booked this hotel through Canadian Affair travel agent at a cost of about 50 per night.This is not a typical hotel - each room contains a sleeping area, a small kitchen and a dining/living area. It's all quite small, but if you're on a budget the kitchen will help keep eating costs down. Everything was clean and tidy, but the kitchen equipment was slightly outdated.The location is some distance from central Montreal where many of the bars and restaurants are located. Walking is definitely possible, but it takes a while and at night we didn't feel 100% safe walking along Rue Maisonneuve in the vicinity of the hotel. It is probably safer and easier to take the Metro to the Atwater station which is a couple of blocks away.Our biggest complaint about the hotel was the fact that we had one night where we were kept awake until after 3am by a party on our corridor! It turns out that most of the rooms on the corridor were taken by US high-school kids who had travelled to Montreal because the drinking age-limit is lower!!! Despite calls to reception, nothing was done about it and the noise made it impossible for us to sleep until the last student passed out!I appreciate that this may well be a rare occurrence, but we felt that the hotel staff didn't go out of their way to help resolve the situation. When we spoke to reception in the morning, they said that they sympathised with us and told us that the students wouldn't be staying there again! There was no apology or offer of recompense."
32,1367,"Aug 15 2007 	Clarion Montreal one word. Awful.	I stayed the weekend of August 10, 2007 and will absolutely never stay again. I had a &quot;suite&quot; which consisted of a twin mattress (whichthey said was a queen bed) which was hard as a rock and a pull out sofa bed( 2 nights with tax totalled $316 CAD). I agree with the other review from that weekend, the elevator in this hotel seems likesomething from cold war russia, and badly needs to be serviced or replaced. Parking at the hotel is also a huge mess, I was able to getinto the garage, but you have never seen a moor poorly designed garage. Most folks end up parking in lots which charge $12-$18 CAD every 12 hours. I also believe they age discriminate. I was forced tosign a &quot;no visitor or alcolhol clause for my room&quot; by the front desk.Being in my late 20s this was insulting, and appeared no where on their website. This hotel is also is completely unsecure, anyone can walk in or take the elevator at anytime they wish, and it's not exactly in the nicest part of the St. Catherine's street area. Oh and it's near absolutely nothing. If you're an American looking to visit montreal completely avoid this pathetic excuse for a hotel thatis no where near anything on St. Catherine's."
33,1367,"Aug 10 2007	Pretty ok for what you pay	The hotel is ok for what you pay. The room we got was ok too. The kitchen is fully equipped as promissed and a little bit bigger than I expected. It is not like your own kitchen, but you will get the basic things.During the weekend you may have some noisy neighbors. The elevators are not fast enough, so you may expect some backup. The towels were almost always missing in the whirpool and sauna. The recepcionists are very nice, but the rest of the staff (at least the ones I met) could be more corteous.Regarding the location, it is pretty close to the subway. You can get to lots of places in Montreal without using your car. The surrondings are a bit rundown, but the hotel is pretty close to lots of restaurants and bars. There is plenty of people walking around this area at night. You can find places that are closer to the real downtown, but I am not sure if that is necessarely a good thing. I suppose the real downtown may be too empty at night."
34,1367,"Jul 15 2007 	Great location decent rooms poor service.	The room included:- 1 queen bed, night tables- smaller TV and table- eating table and chairs- full kitchen with fridge, stove, toaster, microwave, limited utensils, cookware, and dish wares- full bathroom with bathtubLOCATIONThe Clarion is located in a fairly nice area of west Montreal on De Maisonneuve West, close to the Guy Metro. The area has a nice charm with unique-to-Montreal architecture and it is close to many attractions by walking or by Metro. You can walk to Rue Crescent in under 15 minutes, and Rue Ste. Catharine is a block south. The back alley is dirty and dodgy. The area was under construction as of July 2007.AMENITIESThe hotel has a sauna and whirlpool, fitness centre, and a bar on-site but I did not use them during my stay. The free wireless internet worked well. PARKINGUnderground parking is available for vehicles less than 6 feet at an outrageous price of $16.00 per night. Other lots in the area are cheaper if you don't mind outdoor parking, however break-ins, thefts, and vandalism are bad in Montreal, especially if you drive a nice car or one with American plates.CLEANLINESSThe hotel is clean although it has signs of abuse (scuff marks, scratches, etc) probably from the party goers at the hotel. COMFORTThe air conditioners in the rooms are horribly loud and do not work well at dehumidifying the room. These brutal machines really disrupted watching TV, doing work, and especially sleeping!! I might not ever come back to this hotel because of them! The comfort of the furnishings was average. The TV was a little small too.SERVICEThere was confusion with my reservation on their part and it took quite a long time to resolve. The woman was not very friendly although she probably puts up with a lot of BS from people every day at this hotel. Aside from the reservation mix up, I had no problems with the service.OVERALLThis hotel would be a great place for families to stay, however the party crowds who frequent this hotel would keep me from bringing my family to stay there. It is great for those who enjoy cooking once and a while while travelling, and those on business trips with colleagues. That said, I will be putting this hotel on my last choice list when visiting Montreal until they replace those air conditioners."
35,1367,"May 7 2007 	Great experience !	I stayed at the Clarion from may 4th to may 6th, 2007, (2 nights) with my boyfriend. At the check-in, it was a bit long because the girl at the front desk was alone. But she was very friendly and did some jokes with the people. No problem with my reservation, already paid so I took the electronic cards for my room and I went to it, on the 9th floor. This room was very clean, nice bed and big windows. It was a junior suite with a queen size bed, non-smoking. The window can be opened (it's like a patio-door). You have also a little kitchen with everything you need to cook a light meal, but a note advise you to clean the kitchen, because if it's not clean when you're leaving, a 25$ can be charged on your account. In front of the bed there's a tv with cable-channels, and paying-movies (like 11.99$ CAD for a movie... no thanks). Even if we were not that high, the view was great (take a look at my pictures). You already know that it is a great location because everyone said it before, and it's true. A lot of restaurants, stores, bars, supermarkets, etc. Near to metro Guy and metro Atwater (Place Alexis-Nihon, a great underground mall). Of course, 2 tiny elevators for more than 20 floors, it's not the best. But I took the stairs 2 times and it wasn't that bad, sometimes we were 5 in the elevator but some others times I didn't wait and I was alone. There's a laundry room working with change, that's good. The bathroom is very, very clean. I paid 123$ tax included per night, and it was quiet, even if there was a lot of people. The maid I talked to was polite, friendly and nice. The check-out was faster than the check-in, there was two girls at the front desk. We enjoyed our week-end and would go there again. Thanks for reading me and contact me if you have questions!"
36,1367,"Mar 26 2007 	Been going here for 4 years... Really good for the price	I've been traveling to Montreal (as an adult) for almost 10 years and stayed at 4 different downtown area hotels. I made the Clarion my hotel of choice back in 2003. I stay in the Executice Suites with anywhere from 1-3 other guys. The average cost is usually $120CAD + tax (AAA price). First off, let me say I've been more then happy with the size of the rooms. Like I said we've fit 4 grown men in 1 room with no comfort issues. The rooms are always clean, stocked with everything we've needed... and the one time there was a issue of having no hot water in the shower, they had it fixed within the hour. Location was very important in picking the Clarion. It's in a good neighborhood and in reasonable walking distance to the downtown area. The Forum is two blocks over, Cresent is about a 5 minute walk... The 2 main downsides I have with the Clarion is the parking and elevators. The underground parking lot is down an alley, behind the hotel. It's not hard to find but it's gets difficult navigating through it once you get into the lot. Low clearances and narrow spaces make SUVs and larger sixed cars pretty difficult to get in and out of spots. The elevators issue is that there's only 2, and having to accomodate 20+ floors can make the wait a bit of pain in the neck. Other then that I have no complaits about it, the staff as always been accomodating and very friendly. At the moment I haven't found anything better for the price they offer."
37,1367,"Jan 4 2007 	Line Up	Stay For New Years Eve 2007. Paid CAD 125/night + TAX.This is an OK hotel with problems, Good things about this hotel : 1. Good location 2.

Lobby is so small that i need 45 minutes in line just to check in 2. 10 minutes for tiny and superslow elevators.3. Heating system in the room is so noisy.4. Sound proofing is questionable5. If hotel is fully booked, the canches is you'll have no hot water.Pls dont choose this hotel on high season, it's a nightmare."
38,1367,Nov 27 2006	The worst experience of my life	Checking into the Clarion proved to be a nightmare. The staff was too incompetent to enter my credit card properly which was refused. She was asking me all kind of question about my bank account which I thought were strange but I was under shock as I have a new card with a high limit. I asked to use their phone as I assured her there was a mistake. She refused told me to use a pay phone. Here I was stranded with my 3 daughters 200 kms from home and was treated like a thief and a third class citizen. I paid cash for the room and in my car called the bank from my cell. The bank informed me that they never tried to withdraw money and after hearing my story told me they breeched confidentiality I will have to cancell and have a new card as the questions the hotel were asking are highly suspicious. After TRYING to relay this to the hotel and asking them to call the bank I was blatantely accused of being a liar. I asked for my money back without taking a supervisor name to contact the next day. Got my money back.WENT TO DOUBLE TREE HOTEL- CARD WORKED PERFECTLY AND STAFF WAS AMAZING.
39,1367,"Nov 3 2006	Good	I'm from Toronto and I came to Montreal for Halloween weekend. I'm 21 and I came with 3other friends, 20, 19 &amp; 17.I had my wallet stolen from me in the club district on Crescent Street. Careful people!Anyways, we arrived Montreal early in Friday morning and were able to check into the hotel by 3PM. Before that though, we called the hotel to ask if we could come in a bit earlier and they said no. Then I called again and they didn't have my RESERVATION in the system. This pissed me off. They told me to call back ChoiceHotels.ca to see what happened since I did book through them. After all that, we got our room at 3pm.We had the Executive Suite. It was clean and nice. Decor isn't all that great but I knew I wasn't staying at the Hyatt hotel or anything. Reception, maids and service was all good. I don't understand why people in other reviews said they were rude. The hotel is an easy 5-10 minute walk from the Metro (subway) and plaza (with grocery store &amp; shopping!!) and the movie theatre!.The kitchen had everything for us to cook with. Just no hand soap. But there was dishwashing soap. They do need more garbage bags. The 4 of us accumulate too much garbage.I slept in the room with the Queen Size bed and I was cold. Even with the heater on. The Living room was more heated than the bedroom was.and its true, the elevator is slow. The toilet needs some time to flush as well. don't over fill it with tissue. and the lock on the bathroom can be tricky so we didn't use it,Overall, everything was fine."
40,1367,"Oct 31 2006 	Renovations Complete- This place is a ""best deal""	We stayed at this hotel several years ago when it was called the Manoir LeMoyen. Now that renovations are complete and the property is part of the Clarion group- this place has become the best deal that we encountered in quite some time!By all means ask for a no smoking room and a room looking north when making your reservations. We checked in quite late ( close to midnight) and were welcomed hospitably and provided with all the room details requested. ( we ended up on the 14th floor with a view to the mountain)The front desk was able to provide us with directions to the late night &quot;depanneur&quot; stores in the area so we could stock up for a lazy breakfast the next morning.We had a queen size room. Very well outfitted. Good live/ work area. Nice sitting room with couch and chair, dinette AND a most comfortable office area with good office grade chair and free WIFI in the price of the room ( $119 CDN per night - check hotel website for specials)Room service was spot on - if a tad too efficient. We had a difficult time convincing room staff with notes that we did not need a change of sheets and to save the environment.Situated between 2 Metro stops and minutes walk to the shops in Westmount and downtown Montreal- this was a dream location.Be warned - don't attempt the underground garage in anything much larger than a midsize car. But with transportation so close at hand- why bring a car into the city in the first place?A great experience for a 9 day stay!!"
41,1367,"Oct 30 2006 	Good in parts......	We stayed here for 3 nights last week.It is a very tall building (some 22 floors) with only 2 lifts which becomes a REAL problem at popular times or when groups are checking in or out.ROOM - very clean and spacious, nice kitchenette area, small bathroom but with lovely powerful shower and nice big white fluffy towels.Comfortable bedsThey are a bit stingy with the coffee they provide - so be sure to take your own. One per person per day just looks mean.The windows are floor to ceiling which I don't care for on the 16th floor. Nor were the windows properly fitted as the curtains moved around in the wind - and the nets needed a good wash.There were extremely high winds while we were there and it could be heard whirling around.We also had a problem ALL one night with a faulty smoke alarm :-(They did fix it immediately the next day and that wasn't anyone's fault.Not much in the way of views, just flat rooftops.Location is ok - but quite a walk into the centre and very little of any real interest (we were disappointed in Montreal, felt it could have been any major city, nothing special)Bar meals in the hotel are expensive.Overall - OK but nothing outstanding."
42,1367,"Jun 20 2006	Give this place a pass.	We stayed at this hotel for a week so I can speak from experience. How it got a rating of 4 stars is beyond me-it is a 2.5 in my opinion. This is the first time that I have ever rated a hotel but your website has been so helpful to me in picking hotels since my expericne that I feel compelled to contribute. Although we booked for a week, we were offered one of the worst rooms in the place- in bad repair, looking like it had not been renovated or maintained since the severnties. Only when a number of things including the plumbing did not work and the hotel was not inclined to fix it, were we moved to a better looking but still poorly maintained room. Our new room had an ancient unrenovated sub standard kitchen lacking essential equipmeht. for example, it had an oven but no ovenprrof pans or dishes. When we asked the hotel how we could use the oven without pans, we were told that they were not supplied. The plumbing is old and poorly maintained requiring frequent calls to maiteance. When they cleaned the rooms, they frequently did not leave toilet paper or adequate towels, requiring more calls. The staff were stiffly polite but dismissive- it is clear that they were not allowed to do anything or spend any money to keep the hotel in an adequate state of repair or offer adequate customer service. The elevator service is slow and inadequate. We were forced to wait forever for an elevator only to find it occupied by cleaning staff and cleaning equipment. If you are thinking of staying here give it a pass. It could ruin your holiday."
43,1367,"Apr 26 2006	Noisy	Just a word of caution - this hotel is completing renovations through May 15, 2006. The noise is unbelievably loud and prevents any kind of rest or relaxation. It is impossible to sleep on any floor after 7 a.m. I stayed here one night and the next morning people in the lobby were talking about it and the front desk phone was ringing with comlaints as I checked out."
44,1367,"Jan 30 2006	Perfect for a long stay	I've come not to expect much when booking a hotel from an online, name your price, website, but this hotel treated us just like a regular patron. All in all this hotel worked really well for a mom and 11 yo son for their first visit to Montreal. Granted, we had just come from a top notch hotel in downtown Montreal where we were very disappointed, so we didn't have high expectations. Our room was nicely appointed, and the kitchen worked great for us. There is a supermarket about a block away and other small markets in the neighborhood. It was very reminiscent of living in Europe. We would get fresh baguettes daily usually ate one meal a day in the room. We also ordered room service while there and were pleased. There was a nice bistro by the hotel and we enjoyed sidewalk dining. The staff was great and patient with us working on our French. The area is a few blocks from downtown, but we rather enjoyed the solitude and felt like we saw more of the local flavor. Parking wasn't the most convenient, but I've seen worse in a large city. The front desk was great about arranging a local a couple of bus tours for us to Quebec City that far exceeded my expectations! For currency exchange, there's one around the corner from the hotel with the best rates we found in Quebec. Overall, for $40/night!, we were more than impressed with the hotel and our accommodations and would stay there again."
45,1367,"Oct 20 2005	Extremely disappointing stay - not recommended	This is my first time I've felt compelled to give a &quot;terrible&quot; rating to a hotel, but I feel it's well deserved. Let's start at the beginning.A little haggard after a long journey, I went to check in. The front desk staff were busy talking to one another and even when they acknowledged me, they continued to talk to one another and do other things while checking me in. Quite rude (and the first time I've ever had his happen to me). They required a week's deposit (I was staying for 10 days), which is also unusual (I'm used to a week's pre-authorization, not a week's withdrawal).Then I went to park. The parking is located down a back alley with lots of graffiti, and I could understand if some people felt scared in that location. The parking lot itself consists of three floors underground, with only one lane throughout for both directions to share and sharp turns that often require a reversal for larger vehicles. As a driver, youre constantly afraid youll encounter someone else not in a spot.After parking I went to my room  it was a smoking room. I had specifically asked for a non-smoking room due to my Asthma. The front desk told me no other rooms were available, but one magically appeared when I said Id have to check out then.The room itself was laid out oddly  high fashion for the seventies I suppose. The kitchen was complete with stove (missing a knob for the oven), Fridge (with horrible smell in the freezer) and microwave. The bathtub didnt drain. The bed was horribly uncomfortable  I like a firm mattress, but this mattress was hard and bumpy; it felt more like sleeping on a blanket placed on a rock. The chesterfield in the living room had broken springs that, while concealed behind the fabric, dug into you while seated.All of these issues were reported to the hotel (except for the bed, I figure they are probably all the same mattress [it seems new]) and the only things they successfully repaired were the tub (it now takes 10 minutes to drain) and the knob on the oven. They tried to fix the freezer but failed and didnt even come back to check everything was OK.They did give a veneer of service and concern when issues were brought up, though overall their ability to fix them was poor. Sadly, this will have to be the first hotel I put on our companys black list. Im leaving tomorrow when a room at lAppartement becomes available.There is a hot-tub, sauna and an exercise room with a universal gym (old) and a few aerobic machines. Certainly nothing to write home about.If you do choose to go here despite my warnings, I wish you luck."
46,1367,Oct 2 2005	Not great	Stayed here in September 2005. The price was fair and room was ok but there is only a double bed. If you stay here make sure you do not get a room overlooking the back alley. The noise begins at 6 am. Also make sure you have lots of time to check-in and out. It took me over 30 minutes to check in yet there were only 6 or 7 people ahead of me. It only took 15 minutes to check-out with no one in front of me. They constantly answer the phone when serving you. The hotel is within walking distance of down town.
47,1367,"Sep 7 2005	Good value decent location	I stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend and it was really reasonable for the price. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to the main shopping area downtown. Restaurants and supermarkets are very close by and a great convenience with the small kitchen the rooms have, especially if you want to save money on meals! The elevators are slow, so I would suggest requesting a room on the third or fourth floor so you can take the stairs if you don't mind giving up the view. It's not amazing, but it's one of the best deals you'll find."
48,1367,"Sep 2 2005	Did not like this hotel	Had booked 6 nights at this hotel. Could not find the parking garage so had to park on a side street and walk two blocks. Neighborhood is not the best and very run down! When I finally was able to book in, the gentleman behind the desk was very helpful. The parking garage is behind the hotel, down this garbage strewn alley and into this very small underground garage that only one car at a time can either go in or out of. Our &quot;junior suite&quot; on the 5th floor was small. Two double beds with worn material on the table chairs, carpet was looking pretty worn. Small kitchen area, but bathroom was nice. Our window overlooked the garbage strewn alley in the back. The worst part of this hotel was that when coming onto your floor, all you could smell was the meals that people were cooking in their rooms, and this night it smelled like fish was on the menu. The smell was very overpowering!! The air conditioner was very loud and when we were just falling asleep, it would bang and clamor on with such a loud noise that we jumped out of bed not knowing what all the commotion was! The next morning we checked out and went to another hotel in Old Montreal. The price of $124.00 canadian was not worth it. Spent the rest of our vacation (5 nights) in a beautiful hotel in Old Montreal for $20 more and it was a difference of night and day."

1,1369,"Sep 6 2007 	Nice staff lousy air conditioning	The hotel is located in a convenient suburban Montreal location near several highways. For the area it was a fair rate but the area is expensive in general. There were only a few people in the hotel so it was very quiet. The staff was very friendly and helpful.The room upgraded quite nicely, including a nice and clean bathroom. Plenty of TV channels in both French and English. The only problem was the air conditioning. The control is an old dial thermostat which I could deal with but the AC was not cold. I figured it would take a while to cool down but when I laid down to go to sleep I was a bit too warm for comfort. If I had realized earlier that the AC wasn't going to cool the room I would have called the desk to be moved but I was already settled in so I dealt with it. Luckily it was a cool night and there is a window that opens. I would have some doubts about staying here again for the simple fact that the air conditioning was not effective."
2,1369,Jul 30 2006 	Fine for the money ...	My husband &amp; another couple headed up to Montreal for a quick weekend trip (2 nights) Checked around with different search engines to find something under $100.00 (only staying a night and a half) - no luck in city (the outgames going on) had to book outside. Went thru hotwire. Rooms were ok for our needs... just a place to sleep. 3 blocks from the bus station. Just be sure to request a non smoking room if you don't smoke. Even with the spray they gave us - it was overwheming. (hotel booked up and no non smoking available.) For the day and a half we were there is was ok but if staying any longer I'd look for somewhere else.Very basic hotel with limited cont. breakfast.
3,1369,Jul 27 2005	Comfortable	We have been staying at the Comfort Inn for several years. While the place is showing wear it is still a pleasant place to stay outside of Montreal. The accommodations are adequate; the price affordable. Taschereau Blvd. has many fine restaurants. Be aware that there is lots of traffic heading in and out of the city so avoid rush hours at all costs. There is a nearby bus with runs into the city. You need exact change for the ride.
4,1369,"Dec 6 2003	AIRPLANE ENGINE IN THE ROOM	This is my second time to stay in this hotel. Found holiday rate of approx CAD75 from Choice Hotel web iste. However, upon check-in (I did not make reservation) front desk staff claimed there is never any &quot;holiday rate&quot; and quoted eighty something. Fortunately, a supervisor came by and I told him what I got from the website. After a few clicking on their own computer, I was given the &quot;holiday rate&quot; although I was asked whether I am a CAA member which is not the condition of getting this &quot;holiday rate&quot;. I said I am not a CAA member but I normally can get their senior rate. He accepted and I finally get this &quot;holiday rate&quot; Room is average size but the heating system in my room is apparently not in order. It sound like an airplane engine each and every time when it is running. I did not bother to change room as I stayed only one night plus the fact that I found out this problm late at night (after a very time consuming french dinner in the city)"
1,1370,Oct 21 2009 	Great Airport Hotel	THis is a very trendy hotel located within the international departures of the Montreal Airport. CHeck in was wonderful and fast. The rooms were large and airy and the beds were absolutely divine. We were just staying for 7 hrs on a stop over to florida. I would highly recommend this to anyone needed to have a stop over in montreal or needing to catch an early morning flight.Cons: pay wireless internet.
2,1370,"Aug 7 2009 	Nice Hotel	We stayed at the Marriott the weekend of July 30 to August 3. We were in Montreal for a 3 day convention. This is a new, well kept hotel. The rooms are of reasonable size and the beds are very comfortable. There are a variety of restaurants in the area of the hotel and highway access is close.We had the buffet breakfast one day and it was good, although a little expensive-$14.75. Our 6 year old was $8, and she only ate part of a Belgium waffle. Over all a great hotel and we had a good time and a great price, (convention rate). We would stay there again."
3,1370,"Apr 10 2009 	Very Clean	We decided to stay there as they let us park our car while we were away for a week. Our flight was in the evening and they were able to extend our check-out time from 12pm to 1pm. I like their complementary airport shuttle bus service. Our room was very clean and there were two soap bars and a small bottle of shampoo &amp; conditioner in the bathroom. Occasionally, we saw airplanes flying in and out of the nearby airport, MontralPierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, but we were not bothered by the sound at all."
4,1370,"Feb 11 2009 	Great place for park and fly	Being a Holiday Inn member for years I was concerned of the number of bad reviews we read of their hotels near the Montreal Trudeau Airport. These are popular due to their park and fly options. We decided to try Courtyard by Mariott. What a pleasant surprise. The price for at two week park and fly including one night king room was $144 with tax. The hotel is clean and the room was great. Bathroom spotless and nice hand creams, body lotion, coffee maker. The bed is a comfort guarantee. Even though the room was on the freeway side the noise was non existent. Shuttle to and from the airport was free and the pick up and drop off very efficient. If you consider the cost of parking for two weeks you just can't go wrong. No, the parking is not covered nor is it secured as it is just the hotel parking lot but that was not the issue for us."
5,1370,"Oct 7 2008 	Liked the Hotel Not the Location	Very nice hotel with good staff, comfortable bed, nice decor. The location in an industrial business park is not one for walking around and certainly not scenic. A bit complicated to get to from the highway--I could see it but couldn't get to it! You have to use a service road. It had a nice restaurant and there are a few in walking distance--a grill and a McDonalds. Long way to downtown and the Old City. The front desk gave me directions to the Metro station and that was better than driving and paying for parking. Not walkable to the Metro though. Fortunately I had a car. I think tourists would be better off downtown. Kind of inconvenient."
6,1370,"Sep 4 2008 	Kids Loved It 	This was our first time in Montreal, and I was very much impressed by this hotel. We had a car to get around the city so the location was great for us, and you couldn't even hear the airport at all, my kids kept asking where the airport was, that's how quite it was. Great price, right off the highway, mall closeby, with East Side Mario's, Mike's Restaurant, and many others. Clean, clean, clean, and new (that was important to us). I didn't want to sleep in an old smokey hotel room, so this hotel was perfect!! Pool was great (salt water), and exercise room with modern and working equipent &amp; tv. It overall left a great impression on our family, and we would defintiely return."
7,1370,"Jul 12 2008 	Super amazing!!! Stay for the airport cause it's not downtown.	Great hotel... close to airport but you cannot hear the planes go by at night.Food is good, but expensive.Hotel quality is great, service is great and close to airport.Business services are great... 3 computers downstairs and free printer.Love it, love it, love it!I paid $104 for the room."
8,1370,Jul 9 2008 	Very Nice Affordable Brand New	Stayed at the Montreal Montreal Airport for one night. The room was very clean with brand new furniture (hotel is brand new). The front desk agent was very friendly and our check-in was very fast. Very nice pool with salt water. Nice tub as well. Would defenetly recommend it and I will stay there again if going to Montreal.
9,1370,"May 16 2008 	Great rooms!	Had a one day training session so the company booked it for me. Brought the family over and extended it for one more day...total days: 2.Didn't expect anything special as I've never stayed in Courtyards. Usually Hojo types. Building looked bland, so no big deal. Didn't expect anything anyway. But I was really tired from sitting beside my crying children, anything with a roof would have been heaven. Wife drove because I haven't slept but that's for another story...Imagine our surprise, when the automatic doors opened, and were greeted with a warm Bonjour from the front desk. Wow! Great reception hall, at least for its kind...priceline rated it at 2.5 stars...it should get at least a 3.5 for the reception hall.Off to the rooms, and noticed the halls are wide (not like Vancouver hotels)--which was a good thing because we had a double side by side stroller...opened the rooms..Wow! very clean, and well appointed rooms! I thought wow, we got this room for $89!?! What a [----] bargain! Very clean, very nice bathroom...loved the delta faucets. Wish I could get these for my house.Our toddler immediately lit up and ran back and forth in the room...bounced up and down the bed. You don't know how much it was a relief to rest after 6 hours driving. With these kind of appointments, my wife actually was able to take out the clothes and use the drawers...she never use them because she says they're all &quot;icky&quot;...but here she was laying our clothes out, nice and folded. Complaints? Kids room in the basement is bland and nothing much in terms of activities there...well these are usually for business people, so I can't really blame the hotel...also our room window is facing the highway...the noise is not much, but its there and we hear some from the airport itselfOverall, a great experience, family loved it...walked to the Spheron and checked out a small bistro there...great beef paninis and soup!"
10,1370,"Sep 17 2007 	Lovely but noisy.	This is a relatively expensive hotel for an airport hotel. However, it is lovely, newly decorated, modern, cosy. There is an airport shuttle bus which is fast and convenient, and the driver was great. The bus trip comes complete with complimentary apples and water too!The hotel itself is in quite a good location, close to a small-ish mall, cinema and a number of restaurants which are all within walking distance. It is also possible to walk to a tube station, but this might be a little too far for some: about half and hour's speed-march away.The only problem that I have with this hotel is: it is an airport hotel, and close to a busy road, and is therefore noisy. I am certainly not a light sleeper, but would have been gald of a pair of earplugs for this one!"
11,1370,"Sep 11 2007 	Comfortable Hotel close to access	A wonderful stay, room was very comfortable and clean. Only complaint was the wired internet connection in my room was on the slow side, but my other coworkers who stayed there had no complaint, so maybe it was just me. Staff spoke both English and French and were helpful. The restaurant served a great breakfast, with made to order eggs, bacon, sausage, and make-your-own Belgian waffles, around $10 US. I liked that this was some distance (15 minutes) from downtown as it and driving was more relaxed. East access to the 40 and the airport. No problems with the free airport shuttle. Across the street is a movie complex and several restaurants, including the FireGrill restaurant -- great food and service."
12,1370,"Sep 10 2007 	One of the best Courtyard	Though the family stayed one night, we had a wonderful time there. Building, room, bathroom (washroom), room decor, and etc were in excellent conditions. One of the best Courtyards I have stayed in so far.Also, though our view including the flight path for the airport (kids loved it), you still could not hear any (jet) noise even with the window slightly open.Staff was helpful, bilingual, and greeted you with a smile.Though I am not sure what the other hotels around the airport offer, but I would recommend this facility to anybody needing accommodations near the airport.However the only complaint I have is the parking situation due to its location. There is only a dozen parking spaces located out front and the main parking lot was at the opposite end (from our room) of the building."
13,1370,"Aug 29 2007 	Very nice hotel stay away from the airport shuttle	I stayed at this hotel for one night. It's in a good location, close to the airport with some shopping and restaurants within walking distance. The staff was nice and they spoke English and French. The room A/C worked very well and the bathroom had great lighting and was extremely clean. No problems with the internet. I did experience significant problem getting picked up from the airport via the free shuttle. I had to call the hotel 3 times and waited over 45 minutes. No apology or explanation regarding the delay was given by the driver. My reaction to this situation was to forget leaving a tip for her. Overall, I'd stay here again."
14,1370,"Jul 18 2007 	Great Place  Fantastic Staff	Fantastic place for business and family travel, for anyone doing business in the area.The rooms are well kept &amp; very very clean.The staff go out of their way to enusre that your stay is comfortable &amp; convienient.I have stayed at this hotel almost every week for the past 7 months, and have never had a bad experience."
15,1370,"May 28 2007	A Place To Stay	We have stayed at this location about 5 times this year and everytime we stay there it's always the ROYAL TREATMENT. The staff is great and very helpful. The location is super clean and location is close to everything. I've spoken to the wonderful ladies at the front desk and have mentioned that we won't be able to come during the summer months, but will return again after our busy season in the Eastern Townships. It's the place to stay."
16,1370,"Apr 29 2007 	Beautiful Very Up-Scale Courtyard Hotel	April 24, 2006 - The Courtyard Montreal Airport hotel is a beautiful hotel. It is nicer than many of the full-service Marriott hotels that I have stayed at in the past. Every aspect of the hotel exhibits a very high level of quality. Service is excellent.The hotel is located adjacent to Canada 40 and between exits 62 and 65, close to the Montreal Trudeau airport. While we could see the hotel from the highway we had trouble finding it. We called the front desk and the associate helped us with directions immediately.Arriving at the Courtyard check-in was Marriott fast, taking under a minute. Our group of three all received the King rooms as requested. The room rate was $134 Canadian using an available AAA rate.My room was #314, was close to the elevator. The room was beautiful. The dcor and quality of the furnishings impressed me. The bed was firm, but very comfortable. There were both feather and foam pillows and the quality and feel of the linens was excellent. Even though my room faced the freeway I did not hear any highway noise.The room had a flat screen TV with a large variety of both Canadian and US channels. I was pleased to find the Lakers game on TNT, even though they lost! There was also a large selection of pay-per-view movies.The work area was large and featured a two level desk. The bottom level could be pulled out to increase the desk area. There was a comfortable and functional office-style chair and lighting was good. Electrical and broadband connections were conveniently located above the desk.Across from the work area was a sofa and coffee table. The sofa was very comfortable. I did not check, but believe that it was also a sofa bed. Heat and air conditioning was centrally located and quiet.The hotel offers wired complimentary high speed internet service in rooms. The Data Valet service worked well. Running the Speakeasy internet speed test showed a download speed of 570K and upload at 95K. While the regular internet connection worked well, it did not work as reliably with our companys VPN as most Marriott properties do. It took several minutes for Outlook to connect and it went on and off-line several times in three hours. The bathroom was large and also decorated nicely. The combination tub and shower had a great shower head and plenty of hot water which flowed immediately. There were enough thick white towels for four guests. It may be an unusual comment, but the plumbing fixtures in the bathroom were very high quality! Lighting was good and the granite vanity large. Bath amenities included shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.One feature of the new-design Courtyard rooms is the coffee bar area. It has a four-cup coffee maker, is well lit, and has a granite counter top and a mini refrigerator under the counter.A business associate and I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant. As part of the buffet, there is an omelet station. The buffet was pretty standard having a good selection of both hot and cold items. The cost for two complete breakfasts was $28.00 Canadian. Service was prompt and excellent.The Courtyard is connected to a Residence Inn, something that I have not seen before. The two hotels share an indoor swimming pool, large exercise room, and large guest laundry on the lower level of the Courtyard. Next to the guest laundry was a childrens play room with a window between the two.Everyone at the hotel spoke excellent English all though their initial greeting was in French.I really liked the Courtyard Montreal Airport hotel. It is a beautiful property with really excellent service."
17,1370,Mar 20 2007 	0 on 10 For flavour but the rooms looked nice in the pamphlet card	Too Bad. I like Marriott and the rewards plan was good but this hotelhas no real flavour. I felt like I was in a walmart or a hospital waiting to check in. The local area is sorta in the middle of no where and a walk to he local submway was way too long and cold. I overpaid at nearly $133 and what is included. Nothing. I would upload a photo or two but I erased them in a rush to forget Montreal and this hotel in general. Some one tried to tell me its new. Why does it look like an office building that was changed into an apartment building. I am going to stay elsewhere next time I get stuck in Saint Larent. Sometimes its nice when a hotel has flavour and real amenities. Don't ask me about the pool. I almost hit my head on the ceiling. I am booking a days inn in Toronto next week and I think that I will be better off. At least the rate affords me free breakfast. Good luck in Montreal fellas. It was worth it still. NOT.
18,1370,"Mar 10 2007 	Great airport hotel	This is an extremely pleasant hotel with a quality feel to everything you touch. Now one year old it still feels as clean and polished as if it opened yesterday. Close by car to the airport, although a twisty confusing route after you leave the main highway so study that map first! Plenty of snack restaurants within walking distance. Double-queen room very large and well-appointed but with wired internet which frustratingly did not work for me (seemed like broken DHCP server.) Lobby area had excellent free wireless however. We stayed here on a Sunday night and pretty much had the place to ourselves so can't truly comment on noise but we never heard a thing . The construction looks solid enough to discourage disturbance from corridors or neighbouring rooms. Did not eat in restaurant but the bar although comfortable was as usual in hotels rather expensive.Not much else to add to previous reviewers except to emphasise the friendliness of the staff who were great. We used their excellent free airport shuttle-bus but had difficulty locating it at YUL. You have to exit the revolving door from arrivals onto the roadway then look for &quot;poste&quot; (pickup point) number 8 which did not appear to exist. What they forgot to tell me is that you have to cross the first line of postes entirely and you find another roadway, this time including one numbered 8."
19,1370,"Feb 25 2007 	One of the best in chain	RECOMMENDED. Always a fan of Courtyards for predictable quality. This ~ 1-year old property does not disappoint. A modern multi-story facility directly connected to the Suites hotel next door. Decor is modern. All facilities in excellent solid condition. Checkin fast n' friendly. Room quiet despite location next to Trans Canada highway. Rooms well laid out with contemporary styling. Bedding exceptional. Bath area well illuminiated and with bit more style than old gen Courtyards. Easy highway access, this is an industrial area, downtown 15-25 minutes away. Overall - one of the best Courtyards in my experience."
20,1370,Jan 8 2007	Great hotel and wonderful staff	We recently attended with our sports team to a tournament in Montreal. Everything was arranged by telephone and from the moment we got there the facilities and service were top notch.The staff were friendly and knowledgable. The check in with a large group went very quick as the hotel was organized and were waiting for us. The staff were always available to help us out. They provided a free room to store our equipment. The rooms were excellent and the price was more than affordable. Travelling all over Canada to numerous tournaments and over the various years this would rate as the best hotel we have ever used.
21,1370,"Nov 27 2006 	Pefect accomodation for the area	The previous reviewer gave an excellent detailed overview, so not too much to add for description. This is definetely best suited if you have business in the area or are looking for an airport (15 min travel time) hotel. If you are looking for city center, then stay in the center.Yes it is new (I stayed in late Nov. '06) but I found the design, finish and detail well above average. Staff were very friendly and helpful, terrific rooms and I rate the gym well above average for this type of hotel, all brand new best-quality equipment. Only way to beat this would be a dedicated health club.For an industrial type location, it is nice to be able to walk 10 minutes to shops, theatre and a variety of restaurants as I didn;t have a car rented (I could walk to our office).Bonus to me was location, large rooms, free internet, large bathroom with large towells and lots of shelves, the great gym and a decent full breakfast available for a decent rate. I was on the north side and was very quiet. Missed a few more batroom amenities but that was minor."
22,1370,"Sep 5 2006 	New slightly upscale Courtyard but you probably need a car to downtown.	The Courtyard Montreal Airport is a new, above average Courtyard that nevertheless follows the formula set by this Marriott chain.LOCATION: About 10 minutes by Hotel van from the airport, 15 to 30 minuntes by car to Centre Ville(downtown) depending on traffic. In the Northwest corner of Montreal's St. Laurent neighborhood, which affords some facilities in walking distance despite the industrial office park location(see surrounding area below). The building is less distinctive looking than its picture(ie. bland modern).LOBBY: High ceiling, off white tile foor, lighted panel photos of downtown and two attractive lounge areas all well lit give the lobby a clean attractive feeling with a slight touch of elegance. The restaurant(now breakfast and dinner), a small bar(no license yet) sit behind the main lounge and are more upscale than usually found at Courtyards.Rooms: Elevator floor landings are reminiscent of full service Marriotts, hallways are bright with a multicolored modern carpet.Rooms have deep blue carpeting with sperical silver design and some seafoam green, and a muted version of this green is reflected in the wallpaper-all and all, quite attractive. Floor to ceiling sheer curtains backed by a blackout curtain, and faux cherrywood furnishings round out the look. Bedding is the lastest in Courtyard bedding(a welcome change)-white comforters with foot mufflers, upscale linens. The beds are very firm but still have decent padding, though I liked the memory foam laden beds in the new Courtyard in Hershey, PA that I stayed in last December a whole lot better. Rooms have an alcove with a small refridgerator, and there is a flat screened but traditional TV. Rooms are a decent size, but 4 rooms per floor have an extended length adding a sofa to both the two queen bedded rooms and the king bedded ones.(these rooms are spacious). Ceilings on the 6th(top)floor have 10 foot ceilings, adding some spaciousness to even the traditional rooms(we stayed over our 7 days in all three versions of the 2 queen bedded rooms). Bathrooms are a decent size(if not large) but are attractive with faux tile floors and faux green marble in a number of places. Bath amenities are stingy, two small bars of soap, and a container each of shampoo and conditioner. An in wall air/heat unit with thermostat for each room. One room we stayed in had an unpleasant compressor noise from the AC, the other two rooms were fine. Only windows on the north side of the building open. Muted sounds from the hallways was the only noise we heard.Hotel Amenities: There appears to be some room service. In the basement there is a decent sized heated pool and hot tub, a small excersize room, a childrens playroom and modern washers and dryers, all shared with the attached Residence Inn, as yet unopened when we were there. Off the lobby, there is a card key entry room with five PC's and a printer, and a bank of hook-ups for your laptop in one of the lounges, all free of charge.There is a tiny store for snacks, etc.Surrounding Area: None of it pretty, but a block away is an entertainment complex with a very comfortable multi-screen cinema(showing many American films), upscale Italian, SteakHouse and Chinese Buffet restaurants, a downscale breakfast and snack bar, and an Ok coffee house plus, I believe, some sort of nightclub. Across the street is McDonalds, a chain family restaurant and a chain Sports Bar. There is a pizza place behind the complex. A small block further is a mid-size indoor mall with 3 department stores. Our favorite place for breakfast, Chez Coras was a 10 minute walk thru parking lots or ask the hotel van to take you. Chez Coras is Canada's IHOP, but so much better!Staff: Very pleasant, not always knowledgable and trying to get the new hotel off to a good start which was sometimes confusing for them and their guests. We always got a warm Bonsoir when entering the lobby. And, unlike other Courtyards, there was a bellman on hand to help with luggage. No concierge.There is no Courtyard and no outdoor space you would like to spend time in. One final warning-driving in Montreal can be difficult. Signs are universally only in French despite the bi-lingual billing of the city."
1,1371,Oct 14 2009 	Hotel's clean but due for renovation	The hotel is centrally located in downtown Montreal and it's easily accessible to a lot of tourist attraction. Hotel's clean and staffs are very friendly but it's due badly for renovation. It has no swimming pool either.
2,1371,"Oct 12 2009 	Good location good service but hotel could use updates	Stayed here while taking my daughter on a trip to visit McGill university. It is a great location and the service staff was very helpful. Lobby is small, elevator was broken and hallways were a bit shabby."
3,1371,"Sep 27 2009 	Unforgettable memories	The day we went to Montreal, the weather was horrible, it was raining. Our bus arrived early and we were thankful that we were able to check-in early. The staff was super nice. The hotel was clean, the beds were soooo comfortable. Most of the time we spent was in hotel because of the weather but we didn't mind. Location was pretty good. Beautiful during the night time. We honestly enjoyed it!"
4,1371,Jul 17 2009 	Wonderful as always	Another one night stay but we wished it was longer. A lovely hotel - friendly and efficient staff and well equipped rooms (515 is very good). Now they have a resteraunt which serves good food and is no more expensive than most resteraunts in Quebec City. We have stayed here several times now and find it's location - just inside Port St Jean - and amenities excellent.
5,1371,"Jul 8 2009 	manage your expectations	I stayed 3 nights during June. Due to a good offer, I chose this Marriott over the other one (Chateau Champlain) which I stayed last time. I didn't expect it to be at the high end but it is not too bad as it is an old building.Surprisingly, it is not noisy during day or night. The room is small and the bathroom is tiny too as expected but the desk is quite big. Everything is quite dated and worn. Even the pillows are over-used. The air conditioner is super noisy so I had to turn it off in order to sleep. The internet is free and it pretty reliable. The only new thing in the room is the TV which is flat screen.The only thing that really bothered me was finding someone's hair on the bed and in the bathroom. I think is belongs to the maid.The hotel offered buffet breakfast for $11.99 which includes coffee and juice but who can eat so much in the morning.With all the hotels on that street including the brand new Holiday Inn and Hilton Garden Inn beside this hotel, nobody will stay here if Marriott don't make some improvements. I was informed that the hotel will undergo major renovations at the end of the year so I might consider this hotel again when it is all done."
6,1371,"Jun 11 2009 	Needs to be Updated	The Pros  Really good location. Walking distance to many restaurants. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Cleaning crew was very thorough. The Cons  Rooms were small. Dcor needs to be updated. I prefer white comforters as most of the Marriott Residence Inns have in all of their standard rooms. That way, you know that the comforters are clean. Other than breakfast, there is no dining in the hotel restaurant."
7,1371,"Jun 5 2009 	Extremely Disappointed	The moment I saw that you had to drag your suitcase up a few steps to get to the elevator I should have know this hotel didn't take into consideration the comfort of their guests. I think in the U.S. this would be a violation. Enough of that. I found the bed extremely hard. The heating/air conditioner unit was the old style jutting out from under the window. Noisy, could never get the right temperatur. Its the type you find in a seedy motel. Ugh. I also found the rooms to be quite small compared to the Courtyard I had just been in Quebec. Also, the midnight to morning clerk didn't understand English.Now that is just the hotel, which I chose so I can't blame them for this, but the location was terrible. All the action/activity/theater/resturants are closer toward the water. There is another Marriott closer to Notre Dame Basillica. Chose that one for location and you will be better off."
8,1371,"Apr 26 2009 	Don't go there.	We stayed at the Mariott for business. They put a group of students on party in the room next to us. We haven't been able to sleep. Totally unacceptable from a four stars hotel. Even without that, the room was very noisy. Also the room was small and the staff didn't look very serious. For about the same price, it's much better to go to the Delta Hotel just behind the Mariott."
9,1371,"Jan 13 2009 	Best Stay Ever	This Hotel was Excellent the moment i set foot in The lobby, The staff is very respectful , there is also a bell boy who takes your stuff up to your room and we got a perfect rate 99$ a night , the beds are the best and they even give you the choice of what pillow you want! The hotel is pretty small about 8 rooms per floor but thats actually good so there is less noise the only complain i have is that the bathroom was a bit too small and that the valet parking is 20 bucks a night , either than that this hotel is perfect!"
10,1371,Jan 1 2009 	Mediocre room and ok location	Rooms were mediocre but fairly beaten up.There was a bug in the bathroom. Also my wife and son woke up with several mysterious itchy bed bug bites.The breakfast was not the best.The front desk staff was OK.The internet connection was intermittent.We were able to walk from the hotel to the metro and to the downtown area.I agree with the person who wrote an earlier review that said that the bulldozer would be the right next step for this property.This was not up to the high typical standards of Courtyard Marriott.
11,1371,"Dec 28 2008 	Rude and Incompetent Staff	My boyfriend took me to Montreal for a nice getaway. When he booked the hotel, they told us that they were the closest Marriott Hotel near the gay village. They were not. Two other Marriott hotels were closer than this one.When we checked into the hotel, we specifically requested for a non smoking room. They told us that this was a non smoking hotel. However, when we entered our room, the rooms extremely musty. The previous tenants probably were smoking illegally in the room. We asked for a different room but were told that they were sold out. I have asthma, and I had a very difficult time sleeping that night. The following morning, I spoke with the manager on duty. He said that he would resolve the situation. When we came back to our room the following day, the room still had that musty tobacco smell, but this time, I could smell the cheap Lysol they sprayed in the air trying to cover the smoke, but it did not work whatsoever. I called downstairs to the front desk, and they told me that the manager took care of the situation. I told them to come up and smell the room for themselves. We took a nap, but no one ever came to investigate. When we went out later that evening, I told the front desk about the room. He said that he would get someone to look at it. When we came back, there was no difference.The following day we checked out. I saw the manager on duty, and I told him how disappointing our stay was. He said that he &quot;sprayed&quot; a cleanser in the air. I told him that it did not work. I also told him that someone was supposed to come and smell the room, but no one showed up. He said that they were too busy. I guess they were too busy for guests that were not satisfied with their room.This hotel has very poor services, and we will not stay here again. I am very dissatisfied with this hotel."
12,1371,"Dec 9 2008 	Consistent Mediocrity	Marriott earns my business year-in and year-out; I have been a Platinum status guest for over a decade. In general, I view Marriott like McDonald's - they never serve &quot;the best&quot;, but, the product (in this case, lodging) is predictable.This property is amazing small (only 9 rooms/floor), and the staff is invisible - I never heard from or saw any staff members, after check-in, which is very unusual. This property recently stopped charging for internet access (welcome to the 21st century).Their room rate is rather competitive and the location is hard to beat (close to Schwartz's Deli, Old City, and Rue St. Denis).I view this property as a place to sleep, and not much more. Montreal is an awesome city, and, frankly, unless you're ill, there's not a good reason to spend much time in your room, irrespective of where you stay.As a romantic destination, it didn't score a lot of points with my wife, but, Montreal, itself, certainly did."
13,1371,"Oct 9 2008	it was okay but would not stay there again	This was my 6th time to Montreal and my first and last time at this hotel. The lobby was pretty beat up. Rooms were dated. The bathtub would fill up with water when I had a show. And the hotel staff were pretty much invisible. When you have to take the elevator to your room, you have to lift your suitcase up a 4 stairs before you can make it to the elevator. The food in the restaurant was overpriced. The location is okay but there is a newer holiday inn right next door and a four points right across the street."
14,1371,"Sep 25 2008 	Awesome City!	My partner &amp; I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott hotel in Downtown Montreal in March. Overall the hotel was pretty nice and very convenient as far as location goes. The hotel itself was a couple of blocks away from the subway station. We did the Breakfast buffet one time and it was pretty good with a nice selection of food. Tons of good local restaurants there! We did not go hungry while there! The room itself was very nice, as it was two rooms and it reminded me of a boutique style hotel room. The view from the room was nice with a skyline view of the Downtown neighborhood. I wish I could rember the name of the Concierge, as I found him to be extremely helpful and very polite to us. This was our first time travelling to Montreal and we both enjoyed it. The architecture &amp; history is awesome as was Notre Dame. We did the evening light show at Notre Dame and that was nice."
15,1371,"Sep 19 2008 	Enjoyable Stay.	I stayed here mid-September 2008 with my wife and 6-year-old son, for the combined reason of business meeting/vacation. I have to admit that I was very impressed by the very welcoming, friendly, and efficient staff. It was a little difficult to find because of construction downtown, my unfamiliarity with Montreal and problems with our GPS unit - even with directions from AAA in hand. But once found, it was clearly in the midst of things - a short 15-30 minute walk to the Palais des Congress, Old Montreal, and the Mont Royal Park. It was also a short 10 minute walk to the Metro. Parking (for ~$18 (canadian) daily) was available with unlimited in/out privileges but, honestly, it was much easier to get around Montreal without a car.The room was comfortable, clean and well-maintained. We had a nice view of the Mont Royal Park. There was a complimentary wireless internet connection. There was an indoor pool/fitness center available for my family to use and, although I was unable to use it, I was told that it was adequate. There was a lifeguard available and the pool was closed when the lifeguard was off duty 11 am - 4 pm, which greatly limited the use of the pool.Overall, a pleasant experience and a very good value in comparison to other hotels in Montreal (and other major cities)."
16,1371,"Sep 17 2008 	Good Hotel for Those on a Budget	This place isn't as bad as all those reviews make it sound. Sure, the bathroom &amp; room itself are small, but for a 3-star hotel, it can't be beat if you're on a budget.PROS:- Everything in the hotel is very clean. - Beds &amp; pillows are comfy- Shower water pressure was great.- Breakfast buffet was pretty good (a little overpriced at $13.95 CAD for what you get, however). - LOCATION - this place is within walking distance of everything, it was only about a 15-20 minute walk to the Latin Quarter (which you must check out if you're staying a few nights... Rue St. Denis, great restaurants &amp; bars) and a 15 minute walk to Old Montreal- Staff were very helpful and spoke very good English, check-in and check-out were a breeze- FREE WIRELESS INTERNET in all rooms! Also, coffee maker, desk, iron &amp; ironing board, nice little hairdryer... all you need- Reasonable prices &amp; selection for room serviceCONS:- Slightly small bathroom - Windows in the rooms did not open, and so it always smelled a bit musty- The light in our bathroom took forever (sometimes over a minute!) to come on, which was a bit of a pain in the middle of the nightAll in all, the hotel was ok, and I would definitely consider staying there again the next time I'm in Montreal. -"
17,1371,"Sep 13 2008 	OUTDATED Worst Bed In Montreal 	Bulldoze it and Build A New One ,"
18,1371,"Sep 2 2008 	Great location below average room.	Stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Downtown Montreal for Labor Day weekend. Room was below average. Here's the pros and cons:Pros: close to Metro, Chinatown, Latin Quarters, McGill College, Old Montreal, Catherine Street.Cons: No safe, no fridge, very small (13 inch) TV, shower knob is FLOOR LEVEL so you have to bend over in the shower to adjust water, coffeemaker in the bathroom! ([--]!), no mouthwash or toothpaste, no free parking, small rooms with low ceilings."
19,1371,Sep 1 2008 	Small rooms good location	The hotel is quite nicely located - near McGill University and Mont Royal. Old Montreal is a nice walk away. The room (especially the bathroom) was quite small and a bit old. The hotel only offers valet parking at about $20 a night.
20,1371,"Aug 22 2008 	The definition of Average	I stayed here with a friend for 3 nights. It was clean and well-kept. The location was good, not great. There was nothing of note either good or bad. We were able to walk downhill to the train station. It wasn't that far and wasn't that close! We took a cab there from the airport so I don't know about the parking. If you are looking for a clean, reasonably-priced, no-frills place to stay downtown, I would recommend the Courtyard by Marriott"
21,1371,"Jul 18 2008 	Great Location Good Price	I stayed here for 5 nights, had a great time. The hotel was absolutely clean and nice, the rooms were big and clean as well. When i had booked the room i had requested for certain things like extra towels, pillows...etc...and to my surprise when i checked in my bed was full of pillows. Also i reached there way before the usual check in time but the staff was nice and didn't make a big deal. Location was great, the metro and buses are easily accessible, St. Catherine Street is just blocks away. Overall a great hotel just don't expect it to be one of the fancy kind. Definitely worth it if you don't want to spend too much on lodging."
22,1371,"Jul 11 2008 	Nice hotel great location	We were lucky to get this hotel at the very last minute during Montreal Jazz Festival. We stayed for 5 nights at a pretty good value. The hotel is located down the street from McGill University and within walking distance of many great restaurants. Rooms were a little dated, but were clean and very comfortable. The hotel offers free wireless internet which is always a plus. The staff was courteous although we had very little interaction with them once we checked in. The only problem we encountered was that one of the two guest elevators was out of order for the first couple of days. After it was fixed, we didn't have to wait long to get an elevator. Overall, a good value."
23,1371,"Jul 8 2008 	Great Good Location	This is my second stay in this hotel. This time we stayed for 3 nights. The king sized bed was very comfortable. We love the great and varied breakfast spread each morning. There were cookies at the frontdesk in the afternoon, which were yummy. On Sports night, there were also snacks in the breakfast area. All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful, from front desk to maintenance to cleaning etc. Would go back again. Thumbs up overall..."
24,1371,"Jun 11 2008 	Great location	Found an incredible deal through Quebec's tourism website and booked a 5 night stay at the Marriott. The site next door was under construction (new Holiday Inn?) but there wasn't too much noise. Got a free room upgrade to a suite when I checked in (nice surprise!) and really enjoyed having the extra sitting room and space. Nice gym on the top floor, and the room was clean and comfortable. The location is perfect, right on Sherbrooke, very close to McGill, about 10 min to the Musee des Beaux Arts and well within walking distance of Rue St. Laurent and Rue St. Catherine."
25,1371,"May 31 2008 	Good Value	I stayed at the hotel on Memorial Day weekend for two nights. It's a standard Marriott hotel with the standard setup. We got a great deal by using the Sweetheart Deal (check their website). The best parts of the hotel: 1. good location - centrally located so you can walk everywhere, or take the nearby metro if you need to. 2. good value - check the website, we got the 2nd night at 50% off.The worst parts:1. There is construction going on on the buildings on both sides of the hotel. Wasn't really a big problem though. 2. Tiny bathrooms."
26,1371,"May 30 2008	Marriot Courtyard - Montreal	The Montreal Marriot Courtyard has a excellent location in downtown Montreal. It is an older property and unlike the vast spaces that are expected, the hotel has a no frills - straight to business - attitude about it. The reception at the left and the miniscule lobby leads to the lift. The rooms are large and well lit.Wifi all over is a great asset for the business traveller. The beds are clean and comfortable. The management was prompt in sending up a fridge when requested. The coffee machine did not heat up the water.The price was a bit on the higher side. At $135 per night it was certainly high. Would have been fair if it included breakfast.Overall experience was average, but given the location, it was worth the price. Do look up the Tourisme Montreal site, they have additional discounts and interesting gifts."
27,1371,"May 30 2008 	Great Location-Service Iffy	The property is in a great location on Sherbrooke and an easy walk downhill to the Bay and downtown shops and nightlife. The concern I have with the property is the iffy service. The check in process with the front desk is pretty painful. They don't really understand English very well, which makes for a communication barrier from the very beginning. The front desk agent I had (female) tried to make the check-in process so quick it seemed like a fast food counter. She really did not listen to my questions or my needs. When I later asked for directions to the airport, I got the same vibe. The feeling you get is that they do not wish to speak to their customers.If the property could fix its front desk accumen, it would be a much better property."
28,1371,"May 23 2008 	Avoid!	1) When I checked in the clerk tired to give me a higher room rate. I had different rates for the 4 days but the clerk adamantly said my rate was the higher rate for all 4 days. Even on her check in card the rate written correctly displaying what I was saying. Even after explaining to her she did not agree to the rate and went in another room and spoke to somebody and came with the same higher rate for all 4 days and now she had scratched the lower rate from her card. Thankfully I remembered that I had printed my hotel receipt at home and packed it. I had to fish that receipt out of my luggage. Finally only after showing that I got the rate that I was entitled to on the first place.2)There is only Valet Parking at this hotel. On 8th May 2008 I went down to get breakfast (around 7:45 am), and saw my car parked in the lobby. I was concerned since I had not called my car; the Valet brings the car to the front entrance at the request of the client. When I spoke to the concierge they brushed me saying it must be a mistake. I am skeptical though and wondering whether my car was being used illegally without my permission."
29,1371,"Apr 18 2008 	Outdated but great staff	This hotel is a little outdated. The wall paper and ceiling could use a fresh coat of paint. I visited a Novotel and really enjoyed the flat screen televisions on the wall. I think this was a good advantage compared to the televisions provided in the room. I found it to be too small even compared with Holiday Inns that I have stayed at. It is not that I stayed and watched television my entire stay but it was nice to have that option in the evenings before bed. The room felt cramped with the size of the furniture in the room.However, the staff at this hotel was absolutely wonderful and provided excellent tourist information. Kudos! For the price and location, this hotel was good."
30,1371,"Mar 31 2008	Good location and price	For the summer, this was a good deal for the location. There's limited parking however so you have to pay them to valet it. There's a good size pool on the top floor with a good view, and it's walking distance to shopping and dining all around. The rooms felt like what we paid for, as far as decor and cleanliness- not really above average or anything."
31,1371,"Jan 5 2008 	Great Hotel	We were on the 24th floor for 3 nights (Fri-Mon) in mid Sept 2007. Paid $104.50 (room rate) + $21.52 (Taxes &amp; service fees) = $126.06 CAD per night for 2 Queen beds plus complimentary continental breakfast. Room was clean, spacious. Bed was comfortable. Concierge (Simon) was very helpful. You get a voucher to give to the waiter when you go for the Continental breakfast. The voucher includes gratuity so you do not have to tip at breakfast. Continental breakfast included the pastries, muffins, make-your-own-waffle, scrambled eggs, bacon, hash brown, orange juice, coffee etc. Beware of taxi drivers gouging you (it only costs $35 flat rate to go from a downtown hotel to airport). The driver tried to overcharge us thinking we do not speak French. You do not need to know French in Montreal. Most people are bilingual, including hotel staff. Hilton Garden Inn is being built right next to the hotel &amp; is slated for completion next year. We stayed on a weekend so there was no construction noise going on. Ask for a room on a higher floor if you want to minimize construction noise during weekdays. The only complaint about this hotel is that the bathroom was too small. There is enough counter space, good water pressure, but the size of the washroom was tiny. When the door is opened it covered half of the bathtub. Otherwise, it is a great hotel. There is a computer in a small room in the lobby that has free internet access for guests.Traveler's Tip: Just around the corner is rue St. Catherine where you can hang out or shop. Nightlife in Montreal is incredible. There are countless coffee shops, one after another.Visit St. Joseph Cathedral. Admission is by donation. This grand cathedral is located on a hill. There's limited or almost no parking in Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal) so take a taxi. Biodome was fun. There's an animal zoo world for 4 seasons. Book a day trip to Quebec City by Grayline Tour (800-461-1223). It's a 3 hour drive from Montreal on a big Greyhound bus. The tour guide gives a history about the city &amp; then you have time to wander on your own. It was great."
32,1371,"Nov 30 2007 	Location Location Location	We stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend and enjoyed our stay. The hotel is not plush...limited amenities but the rooms are comfortable and clean..no view to speak of! They have a bar/restaurant/pool and spa...all of which we were too busy enjoying Montreal to use!The Montreal tourism website advertised a Sweet Deal with a list of participating hotels..most of which told me they could not offer me the deal since it was limited...? Finally the Marriott Courtyard was able to accomodate me! The deal gave us a discounted rate for the first night and half price for every other night...and a bag of goodies on check in! Nice pkg for a nice stay.The Concierge was very helpful and the location is within a sshort walking distance of the Underground, McGill and restaurant row."
33,1371,"Oct 27 2007 	Not my cup of tea	I booked this hotel after reading the reviews. I definitely don't agree with a lot of them. Our room was tiny and the bathroom was dirty and really small. The hotel needs major renovations. The staff were all very friendly and the location is great, but with the dollar being so weak this hotel should have been much cheaper. I would not go back or recommend it to any of my friends. For a few dollars more we could have stayed in a much nicer and cleaner hotel. Also the elevators were quite dangerous cause they closed so fast and barely gave you enough time to get on and off."
34,1371,"Oct 12 2007 	Great location friendly staff	This was a nice place to spend a weekend in downtown Montreal. The weather wasn't the greatest when we were there, but the kids enjoyed to swimming pool on the top floor of the hotel. Nice views of the city from the 26th floor. The valet parking was efficient, as long as they got their 15 minute warning, the car was ready when you came down to the lobby. The staff were helpful and very courteous. The rooms were clean and quiet. The bath tub was starting to show it's age, but was clean. We didn't have problems with the construction next door as we were there on a weekend and no one was working.The location was great for site seeing, shopping and getting on the Metro to go wherever you wanted in the city."
35,1371,Sep 11 2007 	Good price	We recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for a weekend. There was a half price deal with hotels.com which made it worthwhile. Rooms very clean and reasonably large. Friendly and helpful staff. Full buffet breakfast was very nice and had a good selection of hot and cold items. Walking distance to old montreal as well as downtown shopping. I would def stay there again with the same deal...not entirely sure if I woul have been as happy had we paid full price for the room! In room movies cost about $13 plus tax. They offer in room free wireless but the coverage was pretty poor - we only got 1 bar out of 5. Eventually managed to connect but took a while.
