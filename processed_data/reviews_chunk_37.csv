97,828,"Mar 23 2009 	Great location and above average rooms	I spent two days alone in London while waiting for my friend to arrive and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum. Some of the reviews of this hotel are quite harsh, and in my experience, undeserved. This hotel is a Holiday Inn... not a Hilton, Radisson, or some other four star name. I expected above average accomodations, but nothing fancy. That is exactly what I got. The room was clean, the bathroom large enough, and I had a choice of pillows. The ones in the room were too firm for me, so I called the desk and they brought me a new one within five minutes. I made my reservation on hotwire.com and paid $69 a night. This is a great deal for what I received. If I had paid more than $100 for my room, I would have been disappointed. If you plan on spending lots of time in your room or feel you need a four star or better hotel, don't stay here. For the price and the location I thought this place was great."
98,828,"Mar 18 2009 	My favorite London hotel	I've travelled to London over a dozen times and this is by far my favorite hotel. The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose (with a Starbucks) right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like. Good pub nearby ( Stanhope Arms) with wonderful breakfasts and meals at a good price. The rooms are not huge but far nicer than the other London hotels I've tried. The concierge is very helpful and the desk staff are polite and helpful as well. All major day tours have pick up and drop off from the Forum. I always stay here when in London. My husband and I stayed in one of their suites a few years ago over Christmas and the only complaint I had about it was that the sofa in the living room of the suite was as hard as a rock. Over all , I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London."
99,828,"Mar 13 2009 	Great Location Good Value! Would definitely stay here again!	My girlfriend and me spent several nights at this hotel and I'm really glad we did. Its location is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road underground station (Blue line). From there it's very easy to get everywhere in London and also reach all of the city stations and airports. Besides its position, there were of course other positive aspects to cite for this hotel: check-in was quick, staff was helpful and rooms were clean; just to be very picky on details, restroom looked like it might have needed some refurbishment sometimes in the near future and also there wasn't actually much spare space in the room, but I assume it wouldn't have been much better in other hotels in London. We did not have breakfast nor meals in the hotel so I can not share any details about the restaurant; the surrounding area is very nice though, and populated by many restaurants (different cuisines, from Indian to KFC, from French to Arab) and it looked perfectly safe to walk around, even at night, on our home. Moreover, there was a supermarket just outside of the nearby Gloucester Road underground station, so we were always able to just grab some snacks in the morning before jumping on the next train. Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini-bar service beverages, which completely filled it. Drinks removal from it was considered a purchase and therefore it wasn't possible to just swap the initial content of it with the drinks we were carrying with us at the end of the day (we were actually initially charged for something that we even never took off the fridge... but counter desk refunded us and apologized immediately upon my polite complaints, so everything wad fine at the end; my hint here is just to take a double check of your final receipt ...something which I think is always worth doing though).We were able to find an internet deal and got a double room for about 100/night (for the both of us) and I'd definitely suggest you to immediately book this hotel if you're lucky to find some similar offer. Even otherwise, no matter if it's going to cost you a bit more, I'd still recommend it, considering its location and overall standards."
100,828,"Mar 12 2009 	Please dont believe negitive reviews	After booking this hotel via expedia.com, I was a little worried. Due to the fact that it was my first time to the UK. I was very plesantly surprised!!! The hotel is very easy to get to via the tube (only 37 min) Its really only a block from the tube station. Its a very large hotel, the largest I would say in miles. If you go walking around Kensington, you cant get lost because the hotel towers over everything. Check in was very easy, we we happy to learn that our room was ready at 11am and they up graded our room. Expecting a suite after hearing that we were a little disapointed that an up graded room means, a press for pants, robe and slippers, a can of OJ, and bottle of water and a Kit Kat. None the less it was a free up grade and it was nice to have a sweet treat. There is no need to bring a voltage adaptor. The room has a power strip, with standard US, plugs. If this is your first time to the UK and you travel a lot in the US, the room size is small. There were just two of us in the room and I have no idea how others fit more. (We're not big people I might add) The room is very clean and modern, everyday it was cleaned and fresh towels were given even when we didnt put them on the floor. We didnt eat at the hotel, just because after hearing all the negitive reviews I wasnt even going to give it a try. The morning we went to Burger King, being from the US I thought I knew what to expect. WAS I WRONG! It was bad, very bad! Some sort of sausage sandwich, that was just down right gross. The next day we went to the little cafe next door, also not good. Very basic, and not worth the money. The rest of the time we went to MED KITCHEN. Wonderful!!!! its only a couple of blocks from the hotel located at 25-35 Gloucester road. GIve it a try, you wont be disapointed! The tube was very easy to use, We paid for the trip to and from the airport and got a week in zones 1 and 2 it was perfect! We were able to see all the sights without a problem.For dinner there are many great resturants, check out a couple of travel books and take their recommendations. On our 2nd night we went to LIGHT of INDIA. On all of our travels we try to find an indian resturant. We were soooooo impressed! The food was great. So great on our final light, we went back. The service was the worst service we have EVER recieved in my life the worst. I am still in shock, we were treated so badly. We were not demanding, Please try some where else! All in All I give this hotel a good review. Our trip to the UK was great! I do think next time we will stay more central. But this is a good hotel!Oh! the woman in the business center is a true gem! Went far out of her way and even stayed late for me!"
101,828,"Mar 11 2009 	Easy to find but tiny rooms	Stayed with a friend who had already checked in, so cannot comment on reception staff. The lobby was absolutely heaving when I arrived, mostly tourists but some airline crew too, The room was small, and the tv was too. It wasn't a flat screen, which is surprising in this day and age and would certainly make more room. The bathroom was also tiny, and the water pressure abysmally low. There was a lot of road noise, but this is only to be expected, given the location. As always in these hotels there was only one easy chair in a double room, why? Bed was comfortable, but the room was very hot, even with the window open. There bare plenty of eating places within easy reach."
102,828,"Mar 8 2009 	Would give this 3.5 rating if allowed!	My partner and I stayed in this hotel for a weekend away to celebrate our anniversary. I chose the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for 2 reasons, firstly I knew the area (I stay in London regularly for work) and it's a good place to be, and secondly because I got a reasonable deal via a 3rd party website. Check in was very good. We arrived at 12.30 to find our room was ready and the receptionist very helpful and friendly and my special requests had been noted and acted on. The room itself was clean but very dated (think early '90s blue and yellow with pine!) and the wallpaper was torn and scuffed, there was only an empty space where the mini bar had once been and the carpet was worn. But, the room was bright and airy and a decent size. You could open the windows, there was plenty of hot water and and it was all fairly quiet.We bought vouchers for full english breakfast when we checked in, these were priced at 11.75 each. We ate on the Sunday morning and to be honest I wouldn't bother next time. There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low (we went down at 9.30am, service finished at 11am), there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring - the ingredients seemed poor quality. As previous reviewers have said, there's a variety of shops nearby (Tesco, Starbucks, Waitrose, Paul's Patisserie) and breakfast of a better quality and price can be bought there.Location is great, 5 mins walk to the Natural History Museum, 15 to Kensington High St and 2 mins to the tube and in a high room you can see for miles (the Holiday Inn is the tallest building in the vicinity).There are a number of coach parties checking in constantly and the hotel is also used by airplane staff so there's quite a bit of coming and going at all hours.In summary - it's a bit better than 3/5 but not quite 4/5. If you are expecting luxury and contemporary styling then this isn't the place for you. But if you want a cheapish break in a well located hotel with friendly staff then you could do a lot worse. I would happily stay here for work purposes (although I don't get a choice!) and fully intend to come back again - if the price is right."
103,828,"Mar 7 2009 	not 4**** quality	I got a reasonable deal for this place on the net. When I tried to check in early the receptionist persuaded me to purchase an 'upgrade' to an executive room as that was available but the regular room that I booked wasn't. Well, don't ever consider spending another 35 quid for this upgrade (per night), IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY! Tiny room, dated furniture, the dirt from my shoes wasn't removed by the cleaners during my stay... it's an unremarkable 3*** place in a great location. That sums it up really. Attentive staff working in breakfast room. As already mentioned by some, this place is overrun by groups (incl airline staff), so the reception area is usually in a bit of a state (mayhem is one way to look at it). I got a completely wrong bill on check-out and spent a while on the phone to have it fixed."
104,828,"Mar 5 2009 	Great time - Great Staff	We picked the Kensington Forum as part of a travel package and were very happy with it. The room was a little smaller than typical US hotels but very comfortable. The breakfasts were part of the package and more than continental. There were eggs, ham, fruit as well as fruit, toast and rolls. The business center had convienient computer access during the week. There were Italian, Indian, British, American fast food, and Thai restaurants very close to the hotel on Cromwell &amp; Gloucester Rds. There was a Waitrose grocery store, a pharmacy, and ATM (with no local charges) at the Gloucester Road Tube Station. The Natural History Museum and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum were within walking distance.The air conditioning was non-existant and was uncomfortable until we opened th window."
105,828,Feb 27 2009 	Very Nice Hotel - Would Definitely Come Back	Having read many adverse revies regarding this hotel prior to visiting but after booking!! we were rather nervous and worried about staying here. We needn't have worried-we were very pleasantly surprised. Staff were very pleasant -especially the breakfast staff (the breakfast was very good -plenty of choice and freshly cooked)Rooms were not particularly spacious but were clean and adequate-bathroom was modern but shower was not very powerful.Location was excellent with close proximity to tube station We will definitely stau here again -good value
106,828,"Feb 25 2009 	Don't bother unless you want to feel like an inconvenience to them	I booked this one as none of my favourites were available and I was amazed at the lowish price offered. This hotel used to be 25% more expensive than the Holiday Inn at Cromwell road across the road, but now it was actually slightly cheaper.I booked a rate that includes breakfast, this however is denied by the hotel staff, well I think it is, nore of them seem to speak good enough English to really tell, so I have yet to try the hotel breakfast as I begrudge paying a small fortune for it when there are so many great little cafe's in the area offering better deals.Booking in was a chore, I am a platinum priority club member so I went to the express check in, waste of time that was, the receptionists were both staring bewidered at a customer who had a problem whilst he tried to explain it to them. When I finally got my turn she said four words to me, &quot;name&quot; &quot;sorry&quot; I spelt out my name &quot;credit card&quot; I did think for a moment that she might say &quot;Pin&quot; or tell me my room number but obviously i wasnt worth the effort.The room was a bog standard room, poorly lit with no light on the desk or indeed within 6 feet of it, a noisy aircon/heater and a tv that you cant see from the sofa, you have to sit on the bed.Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a 6.50 bowl of chicken soup I was genuinely pleased to find a lump of chicken in it. The supermarket down the road sell whole cooked ones hot and ready to eat for 3.99.I clumsily spilt sugar on the floor when I arrived in the room, 3 days later it's still there.It's safe to say I won't be coming back, the hotel seems to be overrun with flight crews on a stopover, my attempts to sort out the breakfast were brushed aside when the alleged duty manageress clearly had no interest in me and just wanted to deal with captain scarlet and his trolly dollies.I travel for business and pleasure, and this isn't an unpleasant hotel, its a pleasant hotel run by uncaring staff, the letter from the manager upon my arrival was a survey asking about my preferences for a special lounge for business travellers such as myself, this means that you other punters will be even lower on the list of priorities - don't bother."
107,828,"Feb 24 2009 	Great location for the tube and bus!nice comfortable rooms.	I stayed at this hotel with my wife for 6 nights in total,the first night being pretty disappointing with a shower that didn't work!-but after I called room service it was promptly fixed.The room was spacious and clean and the bed comfotable with the option to choose from 5 or 6 different kind of pillows depending on your needs or allergies etc..The room had a mini bar with a very small section in it for your own drinks etc..Be careful not to move any of the mini bar stuff to make way for your own stuff as its computerized and charges you automatically for doing so!(which can be sorted with a phone call to reception).The last 5 nights were spent in an upgraded room (executive) as the hotel wanted to make it up to us for the dodgy shower the 1st night.The executive was a a bit bigger and and the bed was noticeably larger,a king I think.The complimentary mineral water,orange juice and kit kat chunky was standard in both room types.The staff were generally very helpful,particularly Peter ( Slovakian gentlemen) on reception he was a exceptionally good and a credit to the hotel.Other staff in the hotel were not as polite and helpful but on the whole very good.There are no bottle openers or cork screws in the room so ask room service for them if you need them.This hotel had very comfortable beds/pillows and had good sound insulation so it was quiet in the rooms.The breakfast was also very good and had plenty of things to choose from!I stayed in room 337 and can recommend it for non smokers ( executive room though).Also it is perfect for the Gloucester Road tube station with direct trains to Heathrow airport terminals,very good location turn right as you exit the station the hotels a 3 minute walk on your right hand side."
108,828,"Feb 24 2009 	Interesting Encounter	I don't have a whole lot to add to what's already been written about this place. Just keep in mind that there is another Holiday Inn a couple blocks from this place. If a petite Asian prostitute knocks on your door in the middle of the night and says that &quot;the agency&quot; sent her, but you never called any &quot;agency,&quot; direct her to that Holiday Inn to her instead. (Yes, this really happened to us.)"
109,828,"Feb 14 2009 	Convenient location to tubes	We booked this hotel through American Airlines last minute packages. The website offers a standard room for less money, but we were told by the hotel that the only way to be guaranteed a non-smoking room was to upgrade to a King, so we paid extra.Let me just say that the bed was king size, but the room was tiny and the bed took up most of it. There was about 2 feet between the bed and the dresser. I would not call this a 4 star hotel by any means. It was clean, but the room was rather tired looking and needed to be updated badly. Our room had the wallpaper curling up away from the wall at the seams and stained carpet. If you plan on bringing your computer, know that the wi-fi will cost you 20 pounds for 24 hours. There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it. On the upside, the tube station is very close as well as a lot of restaurants and shops. The lobby is nice and has a restaurant, pub, and a sort of snackbar with Starbucks coffee. There is also a little convenience store located at the front."
110,828,Feb 11 2009 	Very happy with the hotel for the price	I stayed for a night on business. Check in was quick and I was given a room on 22nd floor. People are saying the rooms are small but one I was in was very much the Holiday inn standard size room and was in good condition. View was excellent from the room although weather was terrible during my stay.I got a great deal last minute of 70 quid inc breakfast. Location is very close to Gloucester Road Tube so easy to get into central london for the tourist sites.Breakfast was buffet style and was fine. Reception was busy but service was good throughout my stay. There is the &quot;London Tavern&quot; pub linked to the hotel which works fairly well although I just had a quick drink there. Overall for the price I think it was extremely good value.
111,828,"Feb 7 2009	3 star but 100% not 4 star	Booked this on priceline and thought i had gotten a great deal on a four star hotel. But this is no 4 star hotel 3 maybe. The rooms are very small and can feel kind of cramped when changing and stuff is on the bed. We came during the bad snow showers and the heating is very slow to heat up. We had to order some extra blankets and that seemed like hassel for the staff. The bathroom flooded when showeringThe hallways are quite shabby and need to be changed. Did not eat breakfast there as appers to be just very basic but starbucks coffee is served.. Left my bag in the luggage room and returned to find it open even though clesrly closed when left it in .Some positives are that it is in a good location for the tube. When you get out of station turn right and go down the first turn.The station also has 3 lines on it and is easy to get anywhere and is only 3 stops from victoria station .There is a supermarket near , a starbucks and 24 hour tesco which are handy.Not a complete dump but look harder and find somewhere better esp with the week pound."
112,828,"Feb 6 2009 	Decent few frills close to tube 15pounds/day for internet	I stayed here briefly on the tail end of a business trip because I wanted to sightsee but didn't want to keep paying for a high end hotel.This place is not exactly new or well appointed but clean enough and respectable. There's a small CRT TV, shampoo/soap, and in room instant coffee/tea. It's a very large, not very personal hotel and it's full of airline personnel who take the tube in from Heathrow. It's very close to Glouster station and a few shops. Royal Albert Hall, the V&amp;A museum and a couple other museums are walking distance. Harrods is a little farther but still reachable. I prefer the hotels more central to london but this wasn't bad.Breakfast was pricey so I skipped it...there's a tesco, burger king, and grocery store nearby.The biggest disappointment was the price of Internet. It was 15 pounds a day for in-room wired access or otherwise you had to buy a BT OpenZone card for 6 pounds for 1.5 hrs of access in the lobby. The business center wasn't open the day I was there."
113,828,"Jan 28 2009 	Perfectly fine given the great rate!	We spent a Saturday night in this hotel, having decided at only a few days' notice to travel into London for the weekend.We got a terrific deal at only 59 for a twin room, so our expectations were moderate. It's a great location (we had previously stayed at the Millennium Gloucester Road across the street, so we knew it was a good spot) - literally a minute's walk to Gloucester Road tube station, 5 mins walk to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and the British Science Museum.Our room - and the hotel generally - was dated, looking a bit tired. But we were very content with the beds, the cleanliness and so on. The windows open so you can get fresh air if you want.We didn't bother with the usual overpriced buffet breakfast - because there is a 'Paul' patisserie on Gloucester Road, opposite the tube station. We did have a sandwich and a cup of coffee in the lobby cafe after we checked in - absolutely fine.This hotel was perfectly adequate; wouldn't necessarily aim to stay there again, or wish to stay more than a couple of nights. But for the price, and the favourable location, we were content."
114,828,Jan 26 2009 	pleasant hotel very good location	we stay at the hotel for six nights. we arrived early so they offer us to leave our baggage in very safety store room and we were free for our business.we ask for the room 10 minutes before check-in time and the room wasn't ready. after few minutes of waiting they decide to upgrade us to better room.the room was large . very clean and comfortable.every one in the hotel was very friendly.
115,828,"Jan 20 2009 	Great location for all London has too offer	Sadly we just had an overnight stay here to break the journey from China to Egypt but we would have loved to stay longer. Having stayed in London many times we like the Kensington area as its got plenty of decent hotels, various tube stops, good restaurants and excellent local shopping so that if you don't want to do the full Oxford Street experience you got plenty of choice nearby.We choose the hotel based on its proximity directly across the road from Gloucester St tube station as we travelled on the tube out from Heathrow T5. It was 45-50 minutes airport to hotel reception which we felt was comparable with the heathrow express to paddington which only takes 15 minutes but then you have get to the hotel and the normal tube is 10 quid cheaper per person. Top Traveller Tip: On your last day in London be a generous soul and buy a daily 6 zone tube ticket. Use it for the day around london and to get to the airport then take the lift to arrivals (not departures) and pass it onto to someone who's heading back into the city. Good karma and all that!The hotel is currently under renovation as its soon to change to the Crowne Plaza brand. We had a renovated room and it was really lovely and clean. Modern decor and furnishings, large plasma, small bathroom but excellent bath and shower. The breakfast area and funky bar in the lobby are really nice and the breakfast was excellent with a compact but excellent range of brekkie treats. The only dodgy thing was the lifts which seemed to lurch from floor to floor....Sure wakes you up when you've got some jet-lag!A longer stay would have be nice although the wife hammered the credit card at Selfridges on Oxford Street in a 5 hour spree so it was probably best we only had one night and half a day before our next leg of our RTW trip!"
116,828,"Jan 18 2009 	Good base for exploring London but don't expect much more...	We booked this hotel through lastminute.com's 'secret hotel' booking offer and my boyfriend and I were more than a little dissapointed to find out it was a Holiday Inn upon recieving our confirmation.The staff at the hotel were helpful overall. However, upon arrival we were told that contrary to our booking there were no non-smoking rooms available. Luckily, we didn't mind as my boyfriend smokes and we had only booked the non-smoking room so we wouldn't have to put up with a stale smoke smell. The receptionist advised us that if we were unhappy with the smoking room we should... open the window. We weren't too impressed.We only used this hotel as a base point to explore London and for this purpose it was sufficient. However, if you are looking for a comprehensive hotel experience, I'm sure there are plenty of better hotels available for the same price in the city."
117,828,"Jan 2 2009 	Won't be staying here again.	This was my second time staying in this hotel. The hotel is in a very good location for touring London. It's in a nice area and is right beside Gloucester tube station. There is also a taxi rank outside the hotel. I stayed here before so I knew what the rooms are like. They're average size and very clean. But what has changed in this hotel is the attitude of the reception staff. On arrival I was told that there were no double rooms left. I see from other reviews here that this seems to be the practice at check-in. I was told there were only twin rooms left. I informed the lady at check-in that I had booked double rooms and that I had confirmed the booking two days ago. Still wouldn't accept that I booked double rooms so I showed her a print-out of my booking that specified they were double rooms. Got the double rooms eventually. Got no apology though. This hotel is the no-frills of hotels. If you just want a room, then stay here. But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff.If you are in London on business, forget this hotel. There's no WiFi and there's no internet access anywhere in the hotel at weekends as the hotel's business centre is independently run and is closed at weekends.Stay clear of this place."
118,828,"Jan 1 2009 	There's a good reason it's cheaper than other London Holiday Inns	There's a very good reason why this hotel is so much cheaper than other London Holiday Inns, it's not as good. While check-in was fast and efficient and the reception very well organised you begin to get a real feel for the place as you head for the elevators.The smell of institutionalised catering (like a school or hospital) lingers in the reception area and elevators and as you get out on your floor you begin to realise that this hotel may have seen better days. The carpets are worn and stained, the paintwork chipped and the corridors are soulless and in need of decoration.Now my room was clean, comfortable and the equipment all worked as it should but if this was an executive room then I would hate to have stayed in a standard room. To be honest, the furnishing was way below the standard I would expect, it was all getting tired, the wallpaper was beginning to peel from the wall in places and the bathrooms could do with a total refurb.Don't get me wrong, if you are on a budget trip this hotel, with its nearby transport links to the tourist trail and adequate restaurants, will do you fine. If you have a little more to spend and expect more than somewhere adequate to crash for the night then spend the extra few pounds and stay at one of the more central hotels."
119,828,"Dec 31 2008 	Holiday Inn Kensington Forum a good choice	Clean rooms, great location, close to the Gloucester Tube entrance. The staff was very helpful, though the business aspect to the hotel means it's busy and sometimes noisy. Restaurant on ground floor was very good, reasonably priced. The one drawback was efficiency. Our rooms weren't ready when we arrived (early), which was fine; but they also weren't ready for hours after the official check-in time. The front desk did their best; this was a housekeeping problem. We also requested a room change, but for some reason this never worked out, but then again, we weren't in the room for much time as we were out sight-seeing. So overall, I have to give this hotel a positive review."
120,828,"Dec 28 2008 	A gem of a hotel in Kensington!	To celebrate our one year wedding anniversary, my husband and I booked a trip through Priceline to London, England. The hotel we ended up with was the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum. Having never been a fan of Holiday Inns here in the States, I was a bit nervous about staying there, but I read great reviews on TA so I tried not to worry.Any preconceptions I had about the hotel quickly left my mind when we arrived. From the moment we arrived, the staff was nothing but courtesy, welcoming, and friendly. Our flight got us into England in the morning, but check-in was not until 3pm. The gentleman at the front desk apologized for not being able to check us in earlier because their computer system was down. He directed us to the luggage storage room and told us we were welcome to leave our belongings there. Well the storage &quot;room&quot; turned out to be HUGE! We definitely didn't have to worry about them not having room for our bags. We checked our bags and headed out into the neighborhood for some breakfast. Kensington is absolutely wonderful, albeit a bit pricey at certain places. However, the tube stop is right around the corner. There is a currency exchange, super market, bank, internet cafe, Starbucks, Tesco Express (like a 7-11 here in the States), KFC, and Burger King all within a few minutes walk. When we were able to check-in, the woman told us we were upgraded to a suite because it was our anniversary. I assume they knew this because I had emailed them weeks before our trip to ensure my husband and I had one queen bed versus two twin beds so we didn't have to spend our anniversary in separate beds! The suite was fabulous! Mind you, hotel rooms in Europe are smaller than in the States, but this room was MORE than enough room for the two of us!Our entire stay was amazing. I cannot say enough good things about the hotel or its staff!"
121,828,"Dec 28 2008 	One of the better Holiday Inns	Another week and another Holiday Inn. This time in London, within zone 1. Big hotel but well organised, clean and comfortable. Room was an Executive Club floor room and was larger than average for a London Holiday Inn, well laid out and everything worked! A nice view across the rooftops to the Earls Court Exhibition Centre too!Breakfast was one of the biggest 'help yourself' affairs I have seen - not just your typical Full English but some nice fruit and continental options available as well. Just remember to get there early otherwise you'll be queuing to be seated!All the staff seemed friendly and always said hello, even when passing in the corridors. A great hotel for business meetings, it did the job nicely!"
122,828,"Dec 21 2008 	Really nice hotel	The hotel is just 1 minute walk from Gloucester Road Station. The reception staff is very polite &amp; helpful.Our room was on the 12th floor. The view was amazing.The room was perfect. Very clean, modern bathroom, fridge, tv. Everything you'd expect from a holiday inn.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone."
123,828,"Dec 20 2008 	Give this hotel a miss	I stayed at this hotel for 1 x night, it was 1 x night to long. I had pre booked my room through the priority club, I'm a platinum member and on checking in the reception told me their was only a twin room left. The room was that bad, I did not even unpack. Complaining again to reception got me a double room, which they said at check in was not available. The room was basic but cold, the heating system did not work at all. If you are in London, give this place a miss."
124,828,"Dec 15 2008 	Great Hotel for a great price	Our room (two single beds) was very comfortable, cosy and most importantly very clean. We had a mini fridge and iron and ironing board which was convenient. Lots of channels to watch on TV. Staff very friendly and polite. One or two downsides to staying at this hotel: (1) Slightly noisy - if you're facing Cromwell road the noise from the underground train is not great from 6am till midnight especially if you can only sleep with the windows open. (2) Heating was weak - but then we asked for a cool room. Otherwise it was so convenient: (1) You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money. (2) You are 5 minutes away from the station (3) You are in a great part of town full of nice restaurants. Rooms were cleaned every day without fail and toiletries and coffee sachets etc replenished. Really had a nice experience!"
125,828,"Dec 6 2008 	Better than expected	I used priceline' name your own price and my bid of a $100/night was exepted for a Sunday and a Monday night. Buyer beware,however, that Priceline fees/taxes average about 25%/night. After my bid was exepted I googled this hotel and was a little worried after reading the reviews. Seemed that about 1/2 were good, 1/2 were bad. My wife and I liked this hotel. It was clean enough and the bed/bathroom where adequate. Really liked the fact the window opens on this tenth floor room to let fresh air in while sleeping. Personally can't stand breathing recycled air. It is 2-blocks from the tube station(Glouchester?) in a residential part of London-South Kensington. There is a grocery store/restaurants/pubs within walking distance. Food/Drink a little pricey in local establishments. Kensington is a bit higher priced than other parts of London that we stayed but it is interesting to see all the flats with exotic cars parked all over the place."
126,828,"Dec 6 2008 	Perfectly adequate	This is a standard mid-range modern hotel;in short a Holiday Inn. Rooms are clean and good size by English standards. Rates (improved by decline of the UK pound) as good as you're likely to find in a reasonable quality London hotel. Staff helpful. The one standout is location -- it's only about a block from the Gloucester Rd tube station, which is on the Picadilly line that connects to Heathrow, so being on the west side of London, it's a shorter ride to and from aiport and a very short walk to your hotel with no changes, and then you are close to public transport for the rest of your stay. Good places for breakfast, other meals, groceries. etc. are close by."
127,828,"Dec 4 2008 	Is there anywhere decent in London ?	Just another noisy and impersonal place to lay your head. It wasn't the worst experience I've had, ut it won't have me seeking it out again either."
128,828,"Nov 16 2008 	Good hotel for the price nice location	I just stayed at the Kensington Forum last week via a good deal on Priceline and have no complaints. It's nicer than certain other hotels you'd get in the same price range on Priceline and all in all was nice. Not exemplary but certainly good and comfortable. For whatever reason, we were automatically upgraded to an &quot;executive&quot; room, which apparently are all on low floors, so we didn't get a view (on the 3rd floor) but did have a nice, large room with a comfy bed (and a &quot;pillow menu&quot; which let us choose which kind of pillow we'd like... the maid then took our requested pillows back the first time she cleaned but we complained, got new pillows and they stayed put for the rest of the stay). No noise problems (even on a low floor), good service (bit limited late-night room service menu but the daytime menu looked just fine) and a nice, convenient location. I wouldn't say it stands out particularly, but if you're looking for a reliable, convenient, comfortable place in London, this is a great place to stay -- especially if you can get it at a good price on Priceline or another site like that. Of the three places I've stayed (in the $100-120 Priceline range) in London, this is the clear favorite. I'd happily go back again."
129,828,"Nov 6 2008 	Okay hotel but a bit noisy	I stayed here for 5 nights at the end of October through beginning of November, 2008. It was booked through Priceline.ROOM:A week before my arrival, I emailed the hotel to request a double bed and non-smoking room. Both requests were honored and I was given a room on the 26th floor. The room size is actually not bad - in fact, it is larger than the room I stayed at the Holiday Inn Regents Park 6 months ago. The bed is a Queen size bed and mattress is very firm, which I like. But it can be a problem for people who like soft mattresses.The major downside of my room is it faces Cromwell Road and also an exposed section of the Underground (as it leaves Gloucester Rd tube station). Despite double paned windows and being on the 26th floor, I can still hear noises from traffic and the tube. It didn't keep me awake, but it certainly woke me up in the morning when the tube starts running around 6am.I have previously stayed at the Millenium hotel across the street on Courtfield Rd. That hotel is much quieter when it comes to road/traffic noise.The room has a small fridge, which is a bit cold, but is in desparate need of defrosting. There is an electric kettle, and hair-dryer. However, no in-room safe which is a bit disappointing.Bathroom is a bit small but acceptable. Only bath amenities are shampoo, bath gel, and soap. There is no hair conditioner nor body lotion.LOCATION:Although the hotel is labeled as being on Cromwell Road, the actual entrance is on Courtfield Road. As you exit the Gloucester Rd tube station, hang a sharp right onto Courtfield Rd. You'll first see the Millenium hotel on your left, and the HI is another block further down. It's not as central as I would like, but I like the fact that it's on Piccadilly line, which is a direct route from Heathrow (~40mins ride). Nearby the hotel is a Waitrose supermarket, a Tesco Express. There is also a Paul boulangerie next to Tesco Express.BREAKFAST:I ate breakfast at the hotel once. The only reason I did was because I had a few HI vouchers to burn. There is no way I would pay 14.95 for a buffet breakfast there (16.95 if you want hot food as well). There's simply plenty of cheaper choices nearby. The cold breakfast (continental breakfast) has bread, croissants, cereal, cheese, cold cuts, some veggies. Nothing that spectacular to justify the price.CHECK-OUT:Because I had to pay for the breakfast using my vouchers (in US$), this took forever as only 1 person out of 5 at the front desk knows how to do it. Actually, he wasn't sure either so he had to call somebody else to ask. The entire check-out process probably took 15 minutes. BOTTOM LINE:It's an okay hotel, and I don't mind staying there again if I get it for a cheap price through Priceline. However, I'd be sure to request a room AWAY from Cromwell Rd due to the noise issue."
130,828,"Nov 6 2008	Perfect Location and Excellent Hotel	We stayed at the hotel from Oct 30 - Nov 4. We booked via Hotwire and read all the reviews before we left and we are so happy that we have made a good choice. Our room is 444.Room - clean, good size, everything you need is in the room including the coolerLocation - within every attractions, short walk or you can take the double decker just across the street. Tube is just a few minutes walk.Waitrose (large supermaket) across street that you can get just anything you need to make your stay under the budget.Restaurant - make sure to try Thai and Singapore restaurants - delicious and good price.Staff - professional, friendlyConcierge - knowledgeable and very helpfulTransporation - book on website to www.dot2dot.com before you arrive for pick up and drop off from and to the airport for low cost and less hassle if you have more than 1 luggage.I would definately come back to this hotel with friends."
131,828,"Nov 4 2008 	Great location - good value place to stay	The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum benefits from a fantastic location, right next to Gloucester Road Tube (2 mins walking time max), which offers easy connections to most central London locations and also to London Heathrow airport via Underground (direct) or to Paddington Station for the Heathrow Express. It is within easy walking distance (20 - 30 mins) of many attractions including Hyde Park, Olympia and Earl's Court, South Kensington Museums, Harrods and Kensington High Street shops. While previous reviewers have commented on noise from trains and the main road, this was not a problem for us (5th floor, front of hotel) and I'm wondering if they pulled across the internal window that when in place provides triple-glazed windows that are practically sound-proof.It is a large hotel used by large groups of tourists, airline crew and theatre production staff etc., so can get very busy at times when a coach pulls up with 30 - 50 people to check in. However, we managed to avoid such times and check-in etc., was quick and easy. Wait-times for the lifts (elevators) were sometimes a little long - even though there are 6 lifts, there are 27 floors in the hotel so they get quite busy!The main negative is the room size. Standard rooms are incredibly small (e.g. the bathroom door is a slide-door as there is no room for a normal hinged door). That said, most London rooms are small and as we were only sleeping there, it was not really a problem. The bed itself was a king bed and very comfortable. The room and bathroom were very clean and serviced each day to a high standard. There are no ironing facilities in standard rooms but there is an ill-publicised ironing room on floor 26 - you'll need to ask for directions.Breakfast was included in our package and was excellent. The main restaurant is on floor 1 and offers a full cooked and continental buffet was good choice and generally very good service.If you're looking for a comfortable, clean hotel with a mid-range level of service and easy access, then this hotel would serve you well."
132,828,"Oct 31 2008 	Holiday Inn Kensington - good enough for jazz!	Seeing some of the reviews, sometimes, you wonder what people truly expect for their money. The Kensington Holiday Inn is a good value, no frills, superbly located hotel that merits recommendation. My recent 2-night experience there was that it was clean, comfortable, and well managed. OK, the rooms are a bit on the small side, and it's a tad noisy generally of an evening, but what do you expect from a large hotel slap bang in the middle of one of the main arterial routes into London? This is what I find astonishing about some of the negative comments put forward. Some people really don't get what it's all about. They seem to expect a palace for peanuts, and some kind of rural retreat in the heart of a city. Well, if you are looking for a cheaper option than paying through the nose for similar or worse quality options at some of the central London hotels, then look no further than this. And if you book it through lastminute.com as I did, you will get an even better deal than the quoted card rate. Believe me, the location alone is worth the stay. Great restaurants close by, easy transport and Knightsbridge/Chelsea/Kensington shops all walkable. Well worth it!"
133,828,"Oct 19 2008 	forum kensington not sure	From the time we booked Holiday Inn Forum Kensington I was overcharged some 200 GBP on the fee I was quoted and had some considerable trouble getting this rectified by Holiday Inns central booking officeWhen arriving at hotel in room safe &amp; bar fridge as quoted were not supplied &amp; when I questioned reception they said can't supply a safe but will send fridge up which they did, but for all the good it was with fixed thermostat the drinks we put in it would have stayed cooler outside the fridge.The location is fantastic near Gloucester Station which was very handy for all our needs in transport! Harrods was within walking distances &amp; the pubs nearby were great to have a meal in.Peter the concierge was just incredible with his directions &amp; was extremely helpful at all times, unfortunately the same could not be said for the staff in the Tavern who had no end of trouble working out the bill for us and another couple we were with where we wanted to split the bill even with a calculator they didn't get it right and it ended up costing us 5 GBP more than we should have been charged but as we were on our way to the theatre we didn't have time to argue the toss. When we returned from the theatre and tried to get coffee at the coffee shop at end of foyer we were told that we have cleaned the machine and can't serve you all this at an alleged international hotel!The breakfast we had 1 morning was to say the least quite incredible there was so much variety, there was also no complaint in this area with the staff they were right on the ball &amp; helpfulThis hotel while being high rise had some low moments for us as we felt some areas were really lacking but the hotels location is superb and staff like Peter did try and make your stay worth whileJackie &amp; Laurie MewburnAustralia"
134,828,"Oct 11 2008 	A good value London option	Stayed here for 2 nights on business. Pros - very clean, excellent breakfast, very conveniently located only a minute or two from Gloucester Rd underground station (excellent links to Central London, Kensington etc.), streets around hotel seemed very safe, and there's a good selection of shops and restaurants in the immediate area, an excellent breakfast (plenty of choice, and is cooked for you rather than self-service from a breakfast buffet but is served quickly).Cons - noise from the trains and traffic, although this was far less noticable between midnight and 6am."
135,828,"Oct 5 2008 	Nice and cheap for London	I booked this hotel through Hotwire and to my surprise (shock), it cost only $100 per night. I've never paid so little for a London hotel. The location is South West London and a healthy but doable walk from landmarks like the Museum of Natural History, Albert's Hall, Kensington Gardens, and Harrods. Hotel is very large and modern but the rooms are decent size, clean, though decor has a hint of tiredness. For the price, nothing was included though you can prepay your buffet breakfasts for 12 pounds. Note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods.Not the most intimate or quaint place but for the price, who cares? The Picadilly line takes you directly from Heathrow to Gloucester Road station which is about 50 yards from the Hotel."
136,828,"Oct 5 2008 	Exceed expectations	LOCATIONA block from Gloucester Road Tube which is conveniently on the Piccadilly, District &amp; Circle lines. There is also a Boots Pharmacy (best sandwiches!) and Waitrose in the mall attached to the station. There is also a Burger King/KFC and small Tesco Express across the road. We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service. Average price. There are other real pubs in the area as well. We did not do much walking as our plans were on Oxford St. and in Covent Garden but there is lots to do in the area. To find the hotel, turn left out of the station an walk to the end of the block where you will see the hulking Holiday Inn, turn left again and go up the block to enter the hotel. Other reviewers are right, the entrance is in a bizarre location but once you figure it out, it's fine. CHECKINSuperfast with presentation of Priority Club card. No mention of Priceline. And much to our surprise they gave us our room at 9am on a Monday which we were so thankful for as we needed a nap from our flight and were expecting to have to wait until the afternoon.ROOMRoom 713 facing central London. Non-smoking as requested. Well maintained. Looked much better than I was expecting from other reviews. Bathroom looked new &amp; was clean. Water pressure was GREAT!!! which seemed to be a problem in most other reviews. Bed was ok, a little hard for my taste as were the pillows; nice comforter. However, they have a pillow menu so I suppose I could have requested a softer one. Fridge does not cool at all so just forget about it, groceries so close you can pop out to get anything you need! Quiet at night, some noise from hallway early morning but actually did not prevent us from sleeping until 10-11 each morning. Modern A/C in room easy to control and worked very well. TV good with usual UK hotel channels and a bunch of foreign language channels. Did not use any other facilities or order room service.One complaint was that toilet blocked once on 1st day and it took 3 calls to housekeeping to get someone to fix it (albeit I was inpatient, I think it took about 20-25min total).CHECKOUTVery fast, no erroneous charges."
137,828,"Oct 1 2008 	Good hotel but noisy rooms	Nice clean rooms, good value, and average location near a tube station, but the rooms directing towards the main street outside are all VERY noisy. No free Internet, but great breakfast."
138,828,"Sep 24 2008 	Terrific location wonderful staff excellent pub!	We spent two nights at the Kensington Forum in August, precruise. We booked through our cruise line. We had a wonderful time and will, in fact, be staying there again next September, precruise again. This was our first trip to London and we found the location to be excellent. Within easy walking distance to Harrod's, Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. And the hotel is only two short blocks away from the Gloucester tube station. Ask the concierge for a map of the Tube stations - we found the concierge desk to be most helpful. We arrived from the States in the early morning and were allowed up to our room right off when we checked in. The room was immaculate, and perfect. Loved the huge deep tub - it was a Godsend for a good hot soak after a day of walking the streets of London. Daily breakfast is included on the 4th floor. And we had dinner in the pub downstairs once...excellent fish and chips. There are many restaurants in the neighborhood if you want more variety.I've stayed in Holiday Inn's in the States, this facility was more upscale - I guess it would have to be considering where it's located, in the very lovely neighborhood of Kensington. Lovely hotel, terrific location, wonderful helpful staff, immaculately clean rooms."
139,828,"Sep 19 2008 	No problems here	We only stayed one night - room 310 and bathroom spotless. English breakfast: eat what you like, no problems there either."
140,828,"Sep 4 2008 	Not quite awesome Kensington Holiday Inn Forum	Booked this room via Lastminute's Secret hotels and is described as an awesome Kensington hotel. In fact, the description is correct in that the Hotel is awesome in size - 20+ plus floors but is quite a dated modern concrete structure.On arrival minor blip, in that the receptionist mentioned that I was booked in for 1 night only, in fact it was 2, but this was rectified professionally.Our first room was adequate, simple and clean. However, the aged fitments and holes in the wall where the trouser press once had been did not impress, the hotel provided an alternative room with no fuss.The room was clean,comfortable and quiet. The hotel is ideal for the business traveller not for a romanic getaway.Great location, 1 min from Gloucester Tube."
141,828,"Sep 4 2008 	Would not stay again	Have recently returned from a two night stay at the Holiday Inn Forum, London., with my daughter and seven year old grandson. I was not at all impressed. It started badly and then got progessively worse. We arrived early to check our luggage in and to register that we we available for the 2pm check-in. No problem said the receptionist I will fast track your room so it will be available at that time, and here is the key holder with the number of your room for when you return. We checked our luggage in and went to have lunch. On our return, at 3.15, after a lot of searching on the computer and a long wait, we were informed our family room was not ready would we take a seat and we would be called when it was available. 30 minutes later we were allocated a room,which was very small for three people, we then discoverd that the bed for my grandson had not been made up, nor was there any extra bedding in the room. We contacted the housekeeper ( who did not speak or understand English at all well) and she said she had not been informed that there were to be three people in the room. A chambermaid arrived, whose English was virtually non existant, and she made up the sofa bed with a bottom sheet and a blanket on top, because there were no duvets! My grandson decided to share his Mothers' single bed because of the lack of correct bedding. In order for any of us to reach the bathroom we had to climb over the sofa bed. There was insufficient room for suitcases, the decor was somewhat tired and the room was not soundproof. We only had breakfasts in the hotel and were not impressed for it to be served in a room that was not really a restaurant. There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt. On each table was a large thick mug, into which a waiter poured either tea ( well stewed) or coffee, reminding one of a cheap diner and not a 4* hotel.We had a few other problems, mainly due to the lack of spoken English by the staff. On one occassion we rang down to reception to complain that the TV had a fault, it took nearly 10 minutes for the receptionist to understand, then she said a technician would come to attend to the problem......he never appeared.....etc.On the credit side the luggage porters and the concierge staff were extremely helpful and obliging, perhaps they could change places with the other staff."
142,828,"Sep 1 2008 	Great value and location	Had a one night stay through lastminute.com at an excellent rate. This is a large impersonal-looking hotel but the receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Had fairly spacious and very light room on the fourth floor overlooking a quiet area at the back of Cromwell Road, comfortable twin beds, small but very clean bathroom (with shower not bath, but perfectly serviceable), good night's sleep.Buffet style breakfast was extra on this deal, but if you purchased the vouchers on arrival it was about 10.00 each rather than the usual rate of about 16.00. Breakfast itself was above average(and served till 11am), with plenty of choice of hot and cold dishes and with friendly waitresses.There is a pub style bar on the ground floor which was quite welcoming though perhaps predictably in this up market part of London not cheap.However, overall, the rate offered was very reasonable for this part of the world and the hotel is handily placed near the Tube and trendy restaurants and bars around Gloucester Road."
143,828,"Aug 27 2008 	Excellent location good value	Excellent location in the nice and relatively quiet area 100m from Tube station and shops/restaurants. 15 minutes walk to Kensington Palace.Total mismatch at reception: no standard room was available 40 minutes before announced check-in/right in time/30 minutes after (smoking executive room has been offered instead - see in reviews before). Finally after pressure we were given probably better room than prepaid one. At the departure they wanted to charge us probably for the minibar of another room.Clean room, I can confirm the low pressure of hot water but sufficient for use. Very good english and extended continental breakfast with lot of fruits but the space was not enough so we waited for seats 10 minutes once.Not pure 4-stars hotel but very good value for approx. 100 pounds per night double room."
144,828,"Aug 21 2008 	Suited us fine	We booked two nights prepaid through lastminute.com and then I added an extra night directly with the hotel to ensure that we were in the same room for the three nights. That caused some serious confusion when we checked in - particularly as the hotel was checking in a large group at the time - but eventually it was sorted out with no further problems.The room itself was fine for our family of three when the pull out bed for my daughter was closed but a tight squeeze when open! Still, the room was comfortable enough (the bed in particular)and clean, although some of the fixtures and fittings were slightly worn, e.g. the floor outside the bathroom. The free water and chocolate was a nice touch.The breakfast is bad value and you don't need to book it - there are several options, include Pret a Manger, Starbucks and Paul a short distance away that are much cheaper than 18 per person.The hotel's location is the best thing about it - near the tube stop, museums and Kensington High Street. The building itself is anonymous 1970s - you could be anywhere when you're in your room.For our purposes, the hotel was perfectly adequate - the location was good and the room was clean and quiet."
145,828,"Aug 19 2008 	Good location but need upgrade	I really love the location of this hotel. Kensington is a charming place. And the Hyde Park is perfect for jogging after my business activities.The hotel is quiet old. The rooms are quite small but the problem is they really could use some renovation. Especially they need better soundproofing of the room. I could hear some noise from outside. Other than that, everything is just average (breakfast, gym, lobby etc).So I guess it will depend on what you're looking for. For tourist, probably there are cheaper places around unless you have a good deal with the hotel. To be honest, it's quite expensive rate for the facilities they have. But again, the location could justify charging that price."
146,828,"Aug 19 2008 	Good hotel great area	Eight of stayed here in June of 2008 and paid less than $150 a night which is a STEAL in London in a hotel of this caliber.....thanks, Priceline!!!The hotel is very nice and the location is excellent. It is a leisurely 10 minute stroll to the tube station and then the greatest city on earth is yours!We ate breakfast at the hotel the first morning and it was fantastic but WAAAAAAAYYYYYYY over priced. It woud have been Ok for a Sunday brunch at $30 a person but for a midweek breakfast it was too much. We found a nice little Italian cafe between the hotel and the tube station where we could get a full English breakfast for about $8. There are also some great restaurants around the tube station. We are Americans living in Germany so you can imagine our delight at having a KFC nearby. Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance!!!The hotel staff is great. We were upgraded to Junior suites which included complimentary bottled water, wine and juice in the room. This was very nice. The rooms were extremely small however and with the couch turned into a bed it was impossible to get from the bed to the bathroom. I can't imagine how small a normal room would be."
147,828,"Aug 14 2008 	Exceptionally poor - and surprising - service	Booked through hotels.com - and for a special occassion. Thought that we would be looked after given its rating and the price paid. Arrived, didn't get the room we paid for or booked - apparently they are allowed to do this and its in the small print! - So watch this one. Worse though they knew this when we checked in and we didnt find our booking had been changed until we arrived in our room. Despite raising this with staff on the day and the following day - no one even bothered to get back to us on this. Several other less important things wrong with how they treat customers but not really worth me listing in detail."
148,828,Aug 14 2008 	Bad Staff + Bad Services = Bad Hotel !!	I really don't write much reviews but I felt that I have to write my experience the this hotel. (I stayed there from 26th Jul - 1st Aug 2008) I stayed in this hotel because my company registered me in a course that was held in the hotel.My english isn't that good so I'll try to use simplest words that I can &amp; straight to the point.What happened to me during my stay...1- Two days Before my check in I went to reception to confirm my reservation which was confirmed long time ago &amp; I was told that there is no reservation under my name &amp; when I showed the the emails from there hotel they had to mange a room for me .. that was one wasted hour for me on that day.2- When I tried to check in 2 days later they simply gave me a single bed room where my reservation was a twin bed room when they corrected it &amp; I went to my room it was a smoking room &amp; I had to go back to change it they said there is no rooms available &amp; I have to sleep the night &amp; they will transfer me in the next day like it was my fault !!3- Very rude staff !! when I asked about my reservation they didn't want to check there email &amp; I had to go back &amp; bring the emails to show them that they already confirmed my reservation by email ! ... when i told them that my room is a smoking room &amp; I specified in my reservation that its non-smoking the employee asked me &quot;I wonder how could you specify that&quot; &amp; there was other incidents as well. 4- OK so when you stay in a bad hotel you tell your self it's over when you check out ... think again ... when I checked my VISA when I went back to my country I found out that I was charged 1 extra day that was even before I stay in that hotel (I stayed from 26 Jul - 1st Aug = 6 nights) &amp; the extra night was (7th night on 22nd Jul before I even check in) I contacted the hotel &amp; they even didn't bother to answer so I've already contacted my bank waiting for them to reclaim the extra charge &amp; my lawyer is on standby in case of complications. I've more bad stories about this hotel &amp; I have stayed in less stars hotels but it was more enjoyable than this hotel where I would not recommend to anyone.
149,828,"Aug 10 2008 	Great Hotel	The hotel was clean and comfortable offering smoking or non smoking rooms. We opted for non smoking and were placed on the 10th floor. My husband and I were given a double room which had 2 single beds but we didn't mind. The beds were really comfortable and we slept well. . There were tea/cofee making facilities, which were topped up with tea bags, coffee and hot chocolate every day. There was a fridge in which we kept our own water, milk and pop etc. There was a hair dryer in our room but no iron. The rooms are quite small but suited the two of us. The bathroom had a bath and shower and the towels were replaced every day. Our room had a TV and free wi-fi connection. The windows are double glazed but being on the 10th floor they did not open! There was however an air conditioning unit. We had the full English breakfast which was delicious. You also had the choice of cereals, coissants and continental breakfast. The staff in the restaurant were very helpful and spoke different languages. The concierge in the reception was great, He was very helpful and was able to advise on trips, travelling on and around the London underground, theatre bookings and places to eat etc. He was also very witty! Checking in and out of the hotel was very simple and straight forward. The hotel is situated 1 minute walk from Gloucester tube Station and near shops such as Waitrose and Tesco Express."
150,828,"Jul 23 2008 	Superb Location	Stayed here for two nights and was not disappointed. Hotel is perfectly located for walking to V&amp;A Museum and Harrods. Tube station right beside the hotel and central line to Heathrow Airport so no problem carrying luggage. Room and bathroom both clean and perfectly adequate. TV didn't work, but who needs TV in London. I expect it would have been fixed if we had got around to reporting it.. Very pleasant reception staff"
151,828,"Jul 20 2008 	Well Worth It!	Here's the deal. . . If you're looking for a no-frills hotel that is all about location and price, this is your place. My wife and I booked through Priceline on our recent trip to London. The price was exceptional for the Kensington area, and as many reviewers have mentioned, it is a two or three minute walk to the Gloucester tube station. Gloucester station is excellent as it has entry to three different tube lines. The area is safe, and there are markets and restaurants nearby (La Liasion is a great quick breakfast place). Hotel rooms at the Kensington Forum are small by US standards, and frugal with the ambience, but everything in the room worked and we had a great view. The bathroom was small, and water pressure was weak, but it was doable. All-in-all this hotel was a great choice for the price and location. Since we spent little time in the room to begin with, it really didn't impact our time in London at all. However, if you must stay in a luxury hotel, look elsewhere."
152,828,"Jul 18 2008 	Great location!	The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum has a fantastic location for a city break in London. We stayed there for 2 nights, and got a fantastic deal through the hotel's website. We arrived at the hotel 2 hours before check in, and were delighted when we were offered a free upgrade to a kingsize room, although this was a smoking room, there wasn't too bad a smell, and we just opened the windows. We could also check in early which was great! The room was a decent size for a London hotel room. Tea/coffee facilities, hairdryer, decent television channels. The best thing was the location. Right next to Glouchester Rd tube station, which was very safe to travel, even late at night. The area of the hotel was lovely. Walk down Cromwell Rd to visit some lovely restaurants. I would highly recommend Little India. Yummy!!! Have had some problems with the hotel over payment after returning home, but im sure this doesnt happen often. Overall, a great hotel!"
153,828,"Jul 15 2008	good hotel	I booked this hotel via Holiday inn ,2 nights for the price off 1 .The rooms are clean average UK size .The rooms have air con and the windows do open .The windows have two layers off double glazing making them soundproof. A lot of hotels in the area are converted houses this hotel is purpose built .I paid a promotion rate off 109 for two nights .Without the promotion rate it was aprox 300 .Good location ,near the tube .I could see the tube line from my room on the 15th floor ."
154,828,"Jul 14 2008 	Good price / location but no thrills	This was third time staying at this hotel. The location is great - very close to Gloucester Road Tube, with Waitrose supermarket, coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Got decent price on Hotwire as well. Downside is that it is a no thrills hotel (expected). There is no mini-fridge in standard rooms, so you can't store any food - the hotel used to have mini-fridges. Water pressure is also very weak. Overall, for the price (and considering location), it is a pretty good deal."
155,828,"Jul 4 2008 	Great value and awesome location	This is a big modern, efficient hotel so don't expect old-world charm. Instead you get attractively appointed, decent-sized rooms (by London standards), AC that works, a modern bathroom, plumbing that doesn't gurgle and bang in the night, iron and board, bathrobe and slippers, lots of TV channels and a location that can hardly be bettered. The higher your room the greater the view. The location is terrific for museum-going and the Royal Albedrt Hall is an easy walk away if you enjoy concerts. The area is full of restaurants, particularly if you head into South Kensington and the Chelsea Fulham Road area. Gloucester Road underground station is only a two-minute walk, putting all London at your doorstep and direct trains to Heathrow at a fraction the cost of the Heathrow &quot;Rip Off&quot; Express from Paddington. (Yes, it takes 40 minutes but it would be the same if you took the underground to Paddington etc.) And, of course, as every London visitor knows, you MUST buy an Oyster card to make your bus and underground travel easy and economical. It seems a bit confusing at first but once you get the hang of using an Oyster card you'll never look back. There's an excellent internet cafe right across Cromwell Road from the hotel (the hotel does have a limited-hours business centre and broadband is available in rooms and lobby). A 10-minute walk has you in Kensington Gdns/Hyde Park. Hotel staff are great. The hotel breakfast buffet is okay but not stellar (I was hoping for kippers) but on a par with similar establishments. Overall I couldn't have been more satisfied and far from assigning me a humble room because I'd booked a discounted Hotwire rate, I was given a room upgrade! (This may have been because I arrived early and accepted an available smoking room but it smelt fresh anyway and the windows open). One day they even put complimentary wine, water and orange juice in the room. Finally, a gastronomic tip-off; if you like Italian cooking and a lively bistro atmosphere you'll love Carluccio's. It's worth the 12-minute stroll or you can go one stop to South Kensington underground and it's right there at 1 Old Brompton Road. If I could nail a good rate again at this hotel I'd definitely revisit."
156,828,"Jul 2 2008	Great Location Nice Rooms Friendly Staff	I highly recommend this hotel. It's located close to the Gloucester Road tube stop, which is on the Piccadilly line, and you can take the tube straight from the airport to this stop, then just a short walk (block and a half) to the hotel. The staff at the front desk and the concierge desk are extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are nice and make efficient use of the space (almost all rooms in London hotels are small, so the size isn't unusual). Complimentary tea and coffee in the room, plus a safe in the closet. My only complaint (extremely minor!) is they don't provide conditioner in the bath amenities (shampoo, bar soap, bath gel, lotion, sewing kit, nail file and shower cap are all there, though) so if you can't live without conditioner, bring your own. The windows open so you can let in fresh air. Fun pubs and restaurants within walking distance. All in all, a very nice experience. I'd definitely stay there again."
157,828,"Jun 30 2008 	Forced to endure smoking room for 3 nights!	Excitement at the prospects of staying at a four star hotel in posh kensington turned to dismay at the sight of the ugly behemoth that is the holiday inn kensington forum. The imposing stalinique fascade has no cheerful nor grand front entrance - instead you need to enter from the back after walking past the delivery entrances. The interior is no improvement with pastels and greens reminiscent of 70's florida retirement homes. The cherry on the bombshell cake was however reserved by the chirpy receptionist who said directly that our rooms reserved with priceline are the lowest category rooms and hence we are only entitled to the rooms which they have the hardest time selling so hence double non-smoking rooms cannot be given to us eventhough they are available as &quot;there are still chances someone may pay for them later during the day&quot;. So he put us in a double smoking room on the smoking floor. The smell was overwhleming and we have to open the window to breathe. We tried to complain about the smell but the hotel staff were too busy to pick up the calls as it was evident it was a very busy hotel with in particular a lot of airline crew staying there. Once we managed to get someone, they told us they couldn't do much that day and told us to have our bags packed the next day so they can do the move for us. The next day, after coming back from sighseeing at around midnight, we went up to the room after seeing the queue of 8 persons waiting to see the receptionist and amazingly our keys worked and our bags were where we have left them. Too tired to complain and change rooms, we slept and asked to change rooms again the following morning. The response after a few unsuccessful calls was the same - pack your bags and we'll move them. We grew tired of the same story and literally living in our suitcases and decided to put up with the smoking room with its peeling wallpaper, 16 inch cathode tube tv, low pressure shower and unfluffy towels. It seems to be worst four star hotel I have ever stayed in and the general condition of the common areas attest to the age and high traffic. It wasn't cheap as well as I actually clicked on priceline's offer that a four star hotel was willing to accept USD131 per night etc after my initial bid was not accepted. I'm dissapointed to say this hotel is not deserving of a four star by priceline and priceline should really look into their policy of not giving double non-smoking rooms to priceline customers even when such rooms are available."
158,828,"Jun 29 2008 	Great location service questionable	Checking in for one night at the hotel on the 10th June 2008, we had booked a double smoking room. Upon arrival to the room itself, we discover that we have in fact been given a disabled, non smoking room. Returning to reception I was told that there was nothing that could be done, the hotel was fully booked and that was why we had been given that room. I politely explained about my shock at being given a completely different room than what was booked! The receptionist explained that this often happens when overbookings are made. Whats the point in making preferences when booking then? The issue was rectified (partially) by being upgraded. The overall disinterest from the reception staff seemed to reflect the entire attitude of the hotel itself. One of disinterest for the paying customer. The argument between two of the receptionists with some rather choice language was yet another unprofessional spectical to be watched whilst waiting the 20 minutes for my own issue to be addressed! The room itself was small, though clean and well appointed with a complimentary bottle of wine and water. This I will guess is the norm for guests staying in the executive rooms. Like other reviews, the location of the hotel is great, seconds around the corner from the tube. In the end, I wont stay there again!"
159,828,"Jun 27 2008 	always delivers!	Me and my family have always found great comfort in the Holiday Inn network. Basic necessities like iron, tea kettle, multiple TV channels, safe deposit lockers, newspaper are always available in the room as standard equipment ; and there are no surprises. The rooms / toilets are of a certain size and you can settle in quickly, to start discovering the city youre visiting. Moreover, since it is a large hotel, I find comfort in the anonymity, as I despise being helloed and greeted all the way.The Holiday Inn Forum at Kensington is thus ideal. Check-in was super-quick, the rooms was spot-on and breakfast was more than elaborate. Location wise, the tube station (Gloucester Road) is just around the bend and key restaurants (Bugis St. for Chinese, Bombay Brasserie-Indian, Burger King are just across, including a big supermarket). Even better, the open top tour bus stops right outside the tube station !The Concierge were very helpful and friendly and organized a private car to the airport for just 45 GBP ! All in all, a great hotel to camp and discover the adopted city of the Fab Four ! Go for it !"
160,828,"Jun 17 2008 	Londons little secret!!!!	Great hotel for the price. Booked thru Priceline and was a little leary, but everything turned out perfect. Didnt stay long in the room as thye are quite small, but functional. We had a smoking room and it actually smelled ok, thank god as we dont smoke. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Great location, close to the Underground and several excellent Pubs. Kensington is a upscale area and not overly crowded like some other areas in London. Water pressure was a bit weak, but that is our only complaint. We would def. stay at this hotel in the future"
161,828,"Jun 15 2008 	Good hotel well situated	Only stayed for a couple of nights and spent very little time in the hotel itself but seemed good. Everything was clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the location was excellent, all at a relatively cheap cost. Recommended for a long weekend to see the city on something of a budget."
162,828,"Jun 4 2008 	Nice stay at Kensington Forum	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum after our cruise on the Norwegian Jade. Everything went according to clock-work! When we arrived, we were directed to check-in and our rooms were available in quick order. Luggage was brought to our room within 10 minutes. The concierge directed us to a local pub for lunch, within walking distance, and it was perfect! Harrod's was a walk away so that was our next stop. Upon the concierge's recommendation we had dinner at ASK, an Italian bistro, also within walking distance and it did not disappoint. The following day we had a wonderful continental breakfast (complete with BabyBel cheeses) at the Forum restaurant and then hit the streets. The Gloucester Road tube station is a block away so most of London is within reach by Tube. Our room was clean, though small, the service was great, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
163,828,"Jun 3 2008 	Wonderful stay!	We spent the first few nights of our European vacation in this hotel and enjoyed our stay! The staff was friendly and helpful - Peter at concierge was especially wonderful.The room was very small (as we expected) but clean, modern and comfortable. There was a quirky thing where you had to put your room key into a slot by the door to control the lights in the room. The hotel was a short walk from the Gloucester Road Tube Station (Piccadilly, Circle and District lines)Beware there is another Holiday Inn right down the road so be sure you go to the right one!"
164,828,"May 27 2008 	good hotel great location	While this hotel is very large, and rather impersonal because of its size, all staff were very professional. We arrived early after our flight but were able to check in right away. Rooms were very clean. Nice view of London. Location can't be beat, right on bus lines, next to tube station. It is a little confusing because what looks like the front of the hotel on Cromwell road is not the front. You have to walk around to get in. Short walk to Kensington gardens. I'd stay here again."
165,828,"May 17 2008 	A nice hotel  a resonable rate and a great location	I stayed at this hotel for 1 night in April whilst on Business. Whilst I didn't actually pay for this hotel myself, it was in my opinion a really good rate for a London hotel.It's literally 2 minutes walk from the nearest tube station and is on a great line for seeing a lot of London. I was attending a trade show at Earls Court and it was exceptionally easy to get to from this hotel.The check in was really quick and they allowed me to check-in a lot earlier than I was suppossed to.As I was a lone woman traveller, I felt comforted by the fact that you needed a key to access the guest floors.The room itself was dated and the en-suite tiny, but it did have everything you needed for a comfortable stay.I found the staff exceptionally pleasant, which can be an extremely rare thing in London.I would return to this hotel again."
166,828,"May 13 2008	Nice hotel and very nice room	I liked this hotel, Nice big room and very good customer service."
167,828,"May 7 2008 	Some problems but good things too	Cons:Preferences for non-smoking via Reservation made through Equivio were not known by hotel at check-in.Very slow check-in process. Understaffed reception area, and staff not knowledgeable and not polite.Internet modem not working in the room, and refused to be fixed by hotel. Very bad for a business trip.Cable TV not working in the room, and refused to be fixed by hotel.Warm water pressure was a joke even by UK standards. Had to wait 5 minutes for warm water to kick in even on the 4th floor.Outrageous phone fees: 2.5 pounds for a free 0800 number call. 2 pounds for a local call to a mobile number in London.Pros:Very good location. Good price through ExpediaHotel in general is in good shapeTips:Across the street on Gloucester Road there is a good and cheap Internet Cafe open to 11 PM.Also there is a good 'Ask' Italian restaurant in the mall next to the hotel."
168,828,"May 6 2008 	Great weekend	Booked a break with lastminute.com including trip on London Eye and river cruise, show etc. The hotel room was very clean and housekeeping made up my daughter's bed five minutes after phoning reception. Location of hotel is great, next to Gloucester Road tube, close to museums, short hike to Buckingham Palace etc. A very safe and clean area of London. Also, just as you come out of the hotel (with your back to the doors) walk down the street on your left (towards tube and Tesco Express) and there is a great little cafe (La Laison) that does a full breakfast for 3.45 and a large fresh coffee for 1. The owner was a lovely friendly chap and couldn't be more helpful when my 4 year old daughter asked for something that wasn't on the menu. Would stay here again. The people that complain about the hotel obviously spend far too much time in it."
169,828,"May 4 2008 	Convenient Hotel	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for a short weekend, where the main focus of our trip was to see &quot;The Lion King.&quot; We arrived late at night and easily found the hotel and checked in. The hotel is located VERY close to the Gloucester Tube station. It is an extremely well located hotel. The Kensington area is also a pleasant and quiet place to stay.Our hotel room did not have a view, as we were only on the third floor. But, we were very happy with our room. The bed was big and comfortable. The room may have been one of the quietest ones I have ever stayed in. We did not hear traffic or other guests.We really did not spend much time at the hotel but enjoyed our time there."
170,828,"Apr 21 2008 	Comfortable and Convenient Choice	Great Hotel! I would definately stay here again. Nice clean hotel, in a nice area of town. Close to the Gloucester Tube Station. Very Convenient. The staff was very helpful, especially the concierge. They also offer a wonderful continental breakfast. I highly recommend this hotel."
171,828,"Apr 9 2008 	Location is the only thing it has going for it.	My husband and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for 9 nights starting January 18, 2008. I had written this review upon returning home, but have not had a chance to post this until now (thanks to hospitalization).LOCATION: The only thing going for this hotel. It is a 3-minute walk to Gloucester Road tube station for easy access to the Piccadilly, Circle and District Lines. It is within an easy walk to grocery stores like Waitrose, Tesco Express, and Sainsburys. There are many restaurants in the area. And it is a 15-20 minute walk to Kensington High street, and about a 10-minute walk to Earl's Court Road. Note that entrance to the hotel is NOT on Gloucester Road; it is off Ashburn Place.ROOM: Small even for London standards, but adequate if not staying for more than 2 days. The beds are comfortable, and a kettle is available for making tea and coffee. There is a desk, a phone, and a TV which has more channels than some other budget hotels. The closet space and drawers are adequate, but do not count on being able to store more than two 26 uprights in the room. The room also has a fridge, which is not really a fridge, but a cooler, as described by staff. If you have medication to store, it might not be cool enough for it. Guests are unable to control the heating and cooling modes in their rooms (see below for more details)BATHROOM: The bathroom is a good size. There is a good size tub, and the water pressure in the shower is adequate (could be better). Note that it may take you a while to get hot water and if you like steamy showers, dont count on getting one.CUSTOMER SERVICE: Poor. Front desk hardly ever picks up the phone. Weve had to let the phone ring for about 3 minutes before someone picked it up (try to guess how many rings that would be). Other times, we had given up and just gone to the front desk personally only to find staff members doing nothing! Front-line staff members speak very poor English, and provide VERY poor customer service (exception is Manager, Irene). At check-in, staff tried a questionable up-selling practice on us, which, in my opinion bordered on a bait-and-switch tactic (see below for details).RESTAURANT/BARS: Poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food. Drinks prices are reasonable for a hotel bar. We tried to get a pint glass so we could get some ice from the ice machine, but were scolded for it by the bar maid saying they did not have enough glasses (there were only about 20 people in the bar at that time).OTHER AMENITIES: Microwave and ice machine available on the 25th floor for use by guests (They will not provide you with an ice bucket. We actually saw a woman using the kettle to get her ice). There is a gym, and you would need to get a separate key card to access it. VALUE FOR MONEY: Too expensive for the product you are getting (even at a bargain price of GBP109/night)CONCLUSION: NOT RECOMMENDED. Youre better off staying at the Premier Inn on Knaresborough Place if youre looking to stay in the South Kensington/Earls Court area.*** WARNINGS ***QUESTIONABLE UPSELLING TACTIC: When we got to the hotel the front desk clerk told us that the double room we booked is not available because their reservation centre had overbooked the hotel. They only had a twin room for us. She was quick to add, however, that she would be willing to give us a free upgrade to an executive room for 1 night, which would normally cost us GBP35, but for the inconvenience, she would waive this upgrade fee for the first night only. The catch is, we would need to move to a standard double room the following night. BUT if we wanted to stay in the executive room, we would have to pay the extra GBP35/night for the rest of our stay. Although she made it sound like she was doing us a favour, it was actually us, who would be doing her a favour because they are the ones who can not meet their contractual obligation should they not be able to provide us with a double room (or better), and we are the ones being inconvenienced for having to move to another room. At any rate, we said we did not want the upgrade because we did not want the hassle of having to switch rooms on our second night; we told her we want a non-smoking double room and demanded to speak with a manager. After talking to one of her colleagues, she was suddenly able to put us in a double room. (The whole situation reeks of a very questionable up-selling practice, bordering on a bait and switch tactic. We heard them giving the same spiel to another guest the following night.)HEATING AND AIRCONDITIONING: Rooms do not have individual climate control in the truest sense of the word. The air-conditioning/heating is controlled in the basement for a block of 7 rooms, and that if someone in one room calls about the heat, they may turn on the cooling, but they would have to turn on the heating if someone in that block complains about the cool temperature. The only thing a guest can control is the temperature in either the heating or cooling mode, but not the actual cooling or heating mode. In other words, if the room is already hot, you will not be able to cool it down unless you ask that the AC be turned on, or unless you open a window (which is out of the question considering the noise from Cromwell Rd). This was a problem for me because I have a medical condition that makes me very intolerant to heat."
172,828,"Mar 31 2008 	a safe bet	Arrived an hour before check in and tried to blag an early check in with out luck, but checked in, dropped off luggage and were told a room would be ready in about an hour. A spot of lunch and 2 hours later we returned, but no non-smoking rooms available. I refused the smoking room point blank and pointed out we had already been sent away once. The front desk then took my priority club card and trotted off to see if there was a room nearly ready. He returned a few minutes later and upgraded us to a non-smoking executive room. The room was what we were expecting. Clean but enough room for the two of us...but no more, we had to be organised. The sofa was comfy and so was the bed. A/C worked well as it was very warm. No problems with the bathroom or water pressure. Had to run the water for a minute or so to get super hot water, but that's personal choice. Room was on 3rd floor but there was a private function in their function suite. We could hear the music in our room despite having the TV on until about 1am. (We had requested a quiet room due to jetlag) We called down, but there was nothing they could do except call through. Next time I would want a higher floored room.Basically, It is a typical Holiday inn. Great location, okay value and what you would expect."
173,828,"Mar 28 2008 	A Poor Hotel	The room we booked was supposed to be an executive room. The room we were given was small, poorly funished ( we even had to ask for a second bedside table to be provided) it had the smallest bathroom we have ever had in an hotel and the traffic noise went on from about 06:00 - 02:00. The breakfast was not very nice, under cooked sausages, over cooked bacon and the scrambled egg was grey in colour and tasteless.The lift operating system was hit and miss.The carparking charges were a little eccessive at 67.00 for 2 days and three hours, considering you were a guest at the hotel.We quite like to stay at Holiday Inns, but this is one of the poorest hotels that we have ever stayed in in London and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.I e-mailed my comments to Holiday Inn as soon as I got home and have yet to receive any answer from them."
174,828,"Mar 22 2008 	Definitely can do better in London	The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum bills itself as an upmarket central London hotel, but as an executive summary, I was quite disappointed and would try to avoid it for future stays.Location: The hotel is a short walk from the Gloucester Road tube station, so the accessibility of major London attractions is very good. Taxi from Victoria was about 10 pounds at night. Thumbs up for location.Room: My room was a typical London size (i.e. small), no &quot;points deduction&quot; for that. Bed was a good size and was comfortable, no complaints there. My room was non-smoking and did not smell like smoke. TV was small and had an average channel lineup. My room was clean, although since I only stayed one night I cannot comment about ongoing housekeeping. The hotel did not offer free WiFi, but at least I had a BTOpenZone signal from my room. Overall, I would describe the room as free of serious problems, but drab and in need of modernisation or livening up.Bathroom: My bathroom was, like the room, small. I had a wet hand towel in my wash basin upon arrival, so I cannot honestly describe it as &quot;clean&quot;. The water pressure in the shower was insufficient (and I took a shower at 2 am, so &quot;peak demand&quot; can't be blamed). The amenities were OK, but pretty basic. Plastic cups on a formica counter is definitely not the same as glass on marble.Staff: Staff were quite poor. Like a lot of London establishments, there were more non-English than locals working there; communication was not always easy. Check-in took forever, I have no idea why. Then they tried to sell a &quot;pre-paid&quot; breakfast when it was already included in my rate. My colleague, who was on a separate reservation, experienced even greater frustration when his reservation was &quot;lost&quot;. This despite it being a corporate-contracted hotel using the company rate (so I hate to think what it would have been like for someone on a &quot;special&quot; rate). Check-out at least went smoothly, but again took forever. The doorman was more interested in talking to his friend than paying any attention to the customers. On the bright side, the overworked concierge seemed to know about London and was friendly. Overall, I very rarely &quot;rip&quot; staff like this, but at this hotel they stood out as a weak point. Thumbs down for staff.Facilities: I really didn't use any of the hotel's facilities, so am unable to comment.Miscellaneous: This hotel is used by at least one US airline for crew, and perhaps in recognition of that there is a &quot;crew lounge&quot; that is off-limits to other guests. And, at the time of my stay, there were also a disproportionate number of American high school students, so it was consequently quite loud. However, it WAS around spring break time, so I'm prepared to overlook this as atypical.Summary: This Holiday Inn charged a typical London premium, but offered a mediocre experience. If you are looking for a decent quality hotel, I've had much better success at the Hilton Hyde Park (about the same price). I would not stay at this Holiday Inn again unless the price was halved, because there are simply too many places offering better value in London."
175,828,"Mar 17 2008 	one month biz trip at Holiday Inn	I've stayed at this hotel twice now - each time for one month for work. This place sucks!! The toilets tend to back up and/or become clogged on several floors. General upkeep &amp; cleanliness is poor. The &quot;Full English&quot; breakfast is English all right! It's hideous and inedible.The only reason to stay here is if your broke and have to be in Kensington. Also, this tall crappy building in the heart of a very nice neighborhood is an embarrassing eye-sore. AVOID!One more thing - The elevators require you use your room &quot;card&quot; to go to any floor above the lobby. The cards work about 1/2 the time."
176,828,"Mar 16 2008 	Quantity not quality.	On the positive side the location of Holiday Inn Forum was very handy for a conference I was attending. It is close to Gloucester Road Underground station, and there are a selection of shops, restaurants etc nearby. The bed was very comfortable, and the whole place was clean.However, the rooms were VERY small  I did have an executive room too, with a very tiny bathroom  you know its going to be small when you see a sliding door. Water pressure in the shower was none existent - a pathetic dribble came out. The add ons (films, internet mini bar etc) were high compared to other hotels in central London. Waiting for the lifts took ages  especially in the morning. I ended up using the stairs, which were extremely basic and obviously not intended for guests. Breakfast was appalling, plenty of it, you certainly wont starve, but the quality was awful considering the price paid. The hotel was busy, with many Americans and air flight crews, who I assume have little choice but to stay here!"
177,828,"Mar 10 2008	Perfect for First Visit to London	My husband and I spent six nights at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum over the 2007 New Year's Holiday. We booked through a package deal with British Airways, and we could not have been more pleased with the hotel! The location is superb with the tube and bus stops literally steps away. The area surrounding the hotel had plenty of restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores to meet every need. With it being our first time to London, we were overwhelmed with the large choice of hotels (and the prices.) If we were to return, we would absolutely stay here again. For it being a no-frills Holiday Inn, we were especially impressed with the concierge. Gladstone was a gem in setting up our dinner reservations and various outings. I cannot say enough about how helpful he was. By European standards, our room was large. The bed was quite comfortable, and we had a lovely view of the city. I was somewhat apprehensive about going all the way to London only to stay in a Holiday Inn, but really, this place was perfect and I would return again in a hearteat."
178,828,"Mar 9 2008 	Nice location by Glouchester tube stop	The best part about the hotel is the great location in Kensington. It is close to the Tube stop from which you can get anywhere.The rooms were clean and comfortable.There is a grocery store close by that you can pick up food and a Starbucks nearby.Underground parking is available, but the traffic in the area is terrible."
179,828,Mar 3 2008 	Great Location and great business hotel	I travel to London at least once a year for business and I have stayed in many 3 star hotels around the Kensington/Earl's Court area. Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is a perfect no fuss business hotel with fantastic location. I got a good rate through internet website--and I wouldnt pay over 200 USD per night for this place. The room was clean and breakfast OK. The staff were friendly compared to the average 3 star hotel staff--I liked the American attitude. The hotel is filled with American Airline Staff--so its filled with friendly Americans. A nice change while you are in Europe. The only scary part is the charge when you make a local mobile phone call--4 pounds per call.
180,828,"Mar 1 2008 	Pleasantly surprised	I wasn't sure if this hotel, which i won on Priceline, would satisfy my needs but i have to say i truly enjoyed my 2-week stay there.When i checked in, i asked to be shown several rooms and the staff was happy to do so. I was shown an executive room if i wanted to upgrade, for the price of 35 pounds a night. I said i'd pay 15. We settled on 20 and i think it was worth it. I have read complaints from several reviewers here about the crowded check-in desk but never saw more than a few people at a time waiting. I was also pleased with my room. Although smokers tend to get relegated to the worst rooms (the non-smoking executive had a truly stunning view), i was happy with my 6th floor room.Housekeeping were a bunch of truly kind ladies who took good care of me. Just beware, they like to start early so if you want to sleep in, put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door. I enjoyed the wine/water/Britvic left for me every day and i was especially glad to get a safe in the upgraded room. They really should have a safe in every room, but....I had a few problems with my room the first morning after i arrived. When i phoned housekeeping about them, workmen there within minutes. When they couldn't fix the problem, they moved me to the room next door that same day. Room service took 15 minutes, which shocked me. I found everyone i dealt with to be very friendly. The concierge desk were the best. I loved those guys. They went out of their way to help me.The only thing that really annoyed me was the doors. They latch very loudly, even if you close them softly by hand. I was awoken by 8 or 9 am every morning to a cacophany of latching hotel room doors. And that's the worst i can say about my stay. And yes, the card keys pooped out twice, but it wasn't a big deal to get them replaced.The area around the hotel is truly wonderful. I always felt safe walking around alone, even late at night. Then again, i've always felt safe in central London. There's an internet cafe next to a coffee shop just across the Cromwell Road and the people in both places are extremely friendly. As mentioned, there are several places to buy food if you're going cheap: Tesco's, Sainsburys and a Waitrose just across from the hotel. But the best deal was to be had in the Boots near Waitrose. They had nice salads and sandwiches in the fridges in the back which you could get with a drink and crisps for 3.49 quid. Quite a good deal for the area. And the laundrette just up the road from the internet cafe was one of the cheapest i've used in London.Note to those who like ice: there's an ice machine on the 25th floor."
181,828,"Feb 22 2008 	Fantastic Hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum for five days for a quick getaway for my 30th birthday. I signed up for the Holiday Inn Priority Club soon after booking the trip, and when checking in, was able to utilize the &quot;special check in&quot; for the Club. We were upgraded to an Executive Room, which was fantastic -- double bed, lots of room, couch for extra seating. The room also had an &quot;American outlet&quot; which was very useful. We were very pleased with the room, and the staff was all very nice and helpful, including the concierge service.The hotel is about two blocks from the Gloucester Road tube station, which has three of the city's main tube lines -- making it very easy to get just about anywhere in London. The hotel area is very nice and more residential and relaxed, which is nice to come home to after a long, busy day of sightseeing and shopping. The Tesco Metro is right around the corner, as is Waitrose, and a large Sainsbury is a few blocks down Cromwell Road, making it very easy to pick up a few snacks for your room or your travel bag when you're on the go. We ate breakfast at the small cafe around the corner from the hotel, which was very reasonably priced and very tasty. And we did also eat at the Patisserie across from the tube station, which is more expensive, but also fantastic.We hope to be back in London again within the next few years, and we will definitely be staying here again!"
182,828,"Feb 21 2008 	It was just fine	I booked this hotel through a discount website and got a great rate. For the rate I paid, this hotel is excellent. However, if I had paid the standard rate, I wouldn't have been as impressed.The Pros:Excellent location. And I mean excellent. It's just a few minutes walk to the Gloucester Rd. tube station. The Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum are all just a 10-15 minute walk away. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, grocery stores, internet cafes, etc. A hotel with a lot to offer the guests. There is a breakfast restaurant, a pub on the main floor, a Starbucks with a small restaurant attached, a business center, a fitness center, and a small gift shop in the lobby.Typical Holiday Inn rooms. You know what to expect, and for the most part, the rooms live up to those expectations. They're on the small side, but not oppressively so if there's just 1 or 2 of you.The Cons:The hotel is huge. It's almost always crowded in the lobby with various tour groups, airline crews, and just a lot of guests. The view from the upper floor rooms could be amazing if they would clean the windows more often. But there was so much grime on my windows that it looked like it was overcast all day even though it was sunny outside. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law couldn't even see out of their windows because of the condensation. They thought London was covered in fog the first morning they woke up.Small things in my room that needed to be fixed or taken care of. Two lightbulbs were not working, the refrigerator didn't really get things very cold and it wasn't cleaned very well. No major issues, just annoyances.Indifferent front desk staff. They weren't rude. They just seemed to not care. For example, upon checkout, I realized that they hadn't put my Priority Club # in for the incidentals I had on my bill. When I brought this to the gentleman's attention, he just said &quot;yes.&quot; I had to insist that he put my PC# in the computer.Overall, I would stay here again if I could find a great rate. However, if the room rates were the same and/or I was using my Priority Club points I would choose the Holiday Inn Kensington across the street (where I stayed last year)."
183,828,"Feb 18 2008	Great location pub in the ground floor	Whenever in Europe, I usually stay at B&amp;Bs or a small cheap guest house or traditional hotel/inn. I was in London for a stopover weekend of a semester abroad and stayed here. Having never been to London, I found it easy to get around to places of interest from this location (Gloucester Road tube station 5 mins walking distance). At night, there are plenty of places to grab a bite in the neighborhood and you can feel safe walking around after dark in Kensington. There are a few pubs nearby (Stanhope Arms is good for watching sport), but the only one with a late license that I know of is the hotel's own pub in the celler. It's pretty loud after midnight and prices are reasonable for London. Overall, great hotel for tourists and business travelers. Would stay here again."
184,828,"Feb 7 2008 	Double bed? Third times a charm....	As with just about all the other reviews of the HI Kensington Forum our stay was exceptional! Our only complaint, and it was just a little one that was fairly quickly resolved, was that after winning the bid on Priceline, I called and requested a double bed on a high floor facing East. (It was my SO's first time to London and I wanted him to get a nice view, etc.) When we arrived (after a draining 7 hour weather delay) we were given keys to a room on the 16th floor. Not only did it face the opposite direction that I had requested, but it had 2 single beds! So, we went back down to reception and were told that the only available double bed in the whole hotel was on the second floor (the smoking floor). Because we really wanted a double bed we agreed. Up we went to the second floor and when we opened the door the room had two single beds! So, back down to the reception area and after talking to a third person, we were finally given a nice room on the ninth floor that had a double bed and a single bed. Why we weren't given this room in the first place, I'll never know, but it all worked out in the end!Housekeeping was good. We had fresh towels and toiletries every day and the sheets were changed every other day or so. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, but rather had the full English breakfast at the tiny cafe near the tube station. The men that run it are absolutely the nicest men you'll ever meet! And it's reasonably priced, too!This hotel is perfect if you're in London for sightseeing, football, or business. It's close to 3 tube lines, so you can get everywhere! We'll definitely be staying there again!"
185,828,"Feb 4 2008 	Ideal hotel for weekend break	Just got back from a long weekend theatre break and stayed at this excellent hotel. If i had one complaint it is that check in is very slow but other than that everything was just great.The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a Waitrose , Tesco and various Fast Food joints and restaurants nearby.The room was a nice size , very clean and more than adequate. Why some people moan about the size of their room is beyond me....&quot;get out more you saddo's &quot; a hotel is for sleeping in not living.Breakfast in the Forum was excellent , buffet style continental or full english , fresh and hot . We will be back in London this year and this is definately the hotel we shall be staying in."
186,828,"Feb 2 2008	great location great breakfast!	just got back from a london theatre break this afternoon and think this hotel is one of the best we have stayed in in London. Yes the rooms are small, but realistically, how much time do you spend in the room?! Great location - we did what others have descibed and turned along Cromwell road and went to the other Holiday Inn in error when we first arrived. Surrounded by shops like Tescos, Waitrose and a Sainsburys 5 minutes away. The breakfasts are great during the week - it is in the restaurant that you walk past in the lobby, breakfast is cooked to order (so no queing at those horrible buffet breakfasts) and is hot! Also (and this is very sad, but I loved the fact that they had a bin next to the cereal and milk so that you could put your cereal box in it instead of having to juggle with it and your bowl of milk back to the table - this is the first hotel in the world that I have ever come across with this - told you it was sad). Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out - this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy. All in all, this was a great stay for our purpose and shall use it again."
187,828,"Feb 2 2008 	Do not recommend	This was my second stay at this location in the past one year. I will not recommend this hotel for a the business traveller who has a tight schedule.It takes about 20 minutes to check in and at any time of the day, it takes about 5-10mins to get the elevator to go to your room. The room I was in was ok, but the shower was terrible. Water only trickles out of the shower....the worst I have ever encountered. If you hang around in the lobby, you can hear other people complaining about poor service, poor room quality and a host of other problems to the staff. The staff typically does nothing.Receptionist phones are never answered. I had to try four times to get to the front desk on the phone. The operator does not speak proper english...so it is difficult to make them understand what you are talking.There are a lot of small issues like these. Breakfast was included with my room...the food was good. The rooms are not well shielded from noise and I had folks yapping away in the corridoor practically all night. TV is placed in the room such that, if you try watching for a while, it is guaranteed that you will get stiff neck.In short, like my past experience, this place is not worth the money you pay for. If you are staying for a day or so it is ok...but be prepared for some poor service quality.enjoy your trip"
188,828,"Jan 30 2008 	Good stay at Kensington Forum	My family and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for 4 nights from 20 December. We had 2 connecting rooms - 1double and 1 twin - both very spacious by London standards! Rooms modern, clean and comfortable with good bathrooms. We booked direct on the hotel website and paid 75 pounds per room per night, which is extremely good for London and for the quality of the rooms. The hotel is in an excellent location only a short walk to Gloucester Rd. tube station. A good supermarket called Waitrose is next door to the tube station where we purchased breakfast items, snacks etc for the room. There were also a number of cafes and restaurants closeby as well.We had a very comfortable stay at this hotel and would definitely return."
189,828,"Jan 29 2008 	A very nice hotel	Booked the hotel through the Holiday Inn website and go an advanced weekend saver rate of 88 for a saturday night not including breakfast.The location of the hotel is excellent, in a very nice area right next to the Gloucester Road tube station and direct on the picadilly line from Kings cross. We made the mistake of coming out of the tube station and turning left which is the way to the other Holiday inn, instead turn right out the station and you will see Baileys hotel, turn right and walk for about 2 minutes and the entrance to the hotel is on the right.The lady on the check in desk was very helpful. We had arrived early and were prepared to wait for our room however we were offered an upgrade to an executive room because our allocated room was not yet ready. The room was spacious and comfortable and came with a complementary bottle of wine, water and other refreshments.The only downside to the room is that is was very hot. There was no way of turning the radiator off and the air conditioning wouldn't blow cold enought to cool the room down. We did however open the window which did let in a breeze however to those guests on lower floors it would probably be a little noisy to leave it open all night. The hotel has its own pub which was very reasonably priced for drinks compared to other bars and pubs in London. We didn't use any of the other facilities, there are a number of cafe's nearby for breakfast and as another reviewer has pointed out there is a small sandwich shop which does bacon sandwiches and coffee's etc for those who don't want to pay a fortune for breakfast. There is also a tesco opposite the tube station which is open 24hrs so very handy for late night munchies.On the whole, a very enjoyable experience, will definately stay there again."
190,828,Jan 25 2008 	Great Value	We thought this was a great value for such a great location. The hotel is located just a short walk from the Gloucester tube stop and many restaurants. Easy access to all of the sites in Chelsea and South Kensington. The room was clean and contemporary. The room was actually pretty large compared to other hotel rooms I have seen in London. We would stay here again.
191,828,"Jan 25 2008 	Great location for vacationer	This hotel perfectly suited my teenage son and I for our long weekend as our 1st visit to London. Gloucester Road Tube station was 1 block away and we were able to get around at low cost without any difficulty. As expected, the room was smaller than the usual American hotel, but clean &amp; quiet with fairly new furnishings. The room's refrigerator allowed us to cover several breakfasts &amp; snacks by shopping at the convenience grocery store that was also just a block away, so we skipped the hotel's breakfast. Having 2 sockets compatible with our electric plugs was handy. Concierge &amp; housekeeping were helpful. The neighborhood appeared safe. Several airline crews stayed there.-Bethesda, Maryland"
192,828,"Jan 24 2008 	Small rooms but mine was clean and a lovelycomfy bed	I got a good deal on this stay - 2 nights for 123 pounds room only, through the priority club (intercontinental hotel group loyalty scheme), as I was coming to stay to go to a concert/celebrate my daughters 16th Birthday.Firstly directions to the hotel. The hotel reception/entrance is not on Cromwell Road, but on Courtfield Gardens (I think) behind Cromwell Road, so turn RIGHT out of the Gloucester Rd Station and then turn RIGHT again to walk down the road with Baileys hotel/millenium Gloucester on your Left hand and you will find it on your RHS, next to some plush apartments.Reception, not too busy when I checked in, my room was ready. I had requested a twin on a high floor away from lifts, and was given room 1007, which met these requirements. Reception staff appeared efficient and helpful.The room was small, but there was a window that opened and good views over london (although the windows could do with a good scrub!). The room was clean, and looked fine. There was a problem with our toilet when we arrived in that it was blocked. I tried to get someone on the phone (no answer), but whilst I was ringing the handyman came and sorted it all out. The cleaner had already rung for him to sort it out. We had no problems all weekend, but a traveller across the corridor said his tub was taking time to empty. The bath is a 3/4 size one - dinky! Shower pressure was good. Air con wasn't really working for me, it wanted to heat the room, when I wanted it cooling, hence I loved the open window.The furniture was fine - all light wood, one slight chip to the surface, but we literally used the room to sleep in. There is an empty fridge in the room, ours wasn't working properly, so check if yours is before going down to Waitrose/Tesco for chilled items (I didn't!). Tea/Coffe/hot chocolate are provided in your room. Decoration was to a good standard, and didn't appear to be that old.But the room is as I have previously mentioned rather small - see the photos, literally just enough room to walk between the bed and the dressing table/desk, but so long as you are not intending to spend much time in there you will be OK. Standard toiletries, no safe, which I was surprised about, but it does state that exec rooms do have safes if you need to lock away valuables (we were in a standard room).Public areas were buzzing with activity, this is a large hotel so will have many people going through. Nice touch in the lifts, you have to put your room key in to get you to your floor - adds to your safety! Also have a bell for your room and security looking glass on your door, for added personal security.On our first evening chocolates were delivered to our room. I wasn't sure whether this was to say Happy Birthday to my daughter or apologize for the blocked loo, but it was a nice touch.All in all a pleasant stay for a good price. We ate out at ASK - pizza and pasta place on the Cromwell Road, which was lovely, and had breakfast in the small cafe next to the tube, which will make you a bacon sarnie for breakfast (or anything else for that matter!), whilst you listen to the cab drivers winding each other up over a cup of coffee."
193,828,"Jan 24 2008 	Great Hotel	I've stayed here a lot - but not for about 18 months - and I went back there a couple of weeks ago.I've reviewed this hotel before, but that was a couple of years ago and the review has since gone, but my view on the hotel hasn't changed.It is a very busy hotel and has a lot of comings and goings which is great if you're a people watcher (which I am sometimes). The rooms are of a high standard, they're clean, tidy, modern and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. In fact, I always try to stay there if I can get in.The food is very, very good (I had the game pie one night) and the staff were very friendly. The bar itself is very, very busy and I didn't try to go in there, but what I did do was go to the restaraunt at the front and get my game pie served to me at the seating area in front of reception. (Note that there is a &quot;discretionery&quot; service charge in the restaraunt).Breakfast in either the 1st floor or ground floor restaraunt is very good, choice on the 1st floor is far better - for a quick breakfast, use the ground floor one as the 1st floor one can get very busy.Proximity to the tube is excellent as is the very handy Waitrose (buy your wine here!).I've never tried the restaraunt though as I've either eaten in the bar or gone on to Covent Garden.All in all, a great hotel - but book early!"
194,828,"Jan 17 2008 	Got locked out of my room	Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights whilst attending the BETT conference at Olympia which is about 20 mins walk away. It was a busy time for the hotel and I must say I didn't think it was up to the standards I would expect from a Holiday Inn. Small room/bathroom, queues for breakfast and an incredibly packed bar.My company was paying the bill, but despite having my card swiped for prepayment and approved on checking in - I couldn't get in my room the following evening. Apparently security had locked me out because there was a question over how the bill would be settled - no extras had been charged to my room. I can't think why on earth there was any problem. I would have appreciated a note under the door rather than a draconian lock-out. The reception staff had no idea why I was locked out and tried new keys a couple of times before realising it wasn't the key.I wouldn't stay there again."
195,828,Jan 11 2008	alex	The hotel was good and in a great location. It was also very good for the glouster road tube station. The only problem was when the fire alarm went off at 3 in the morning and we all had to evacuate. The rooms are also in need of decaration
196,828,"Jan 7 2008	Lovely position	My husband, my two teenage daughters and I stayed at the Kensington Forum from the 18th December until the 25th December.We were delighted with the hotel, particularly the situation as it is in a lovely area of London. The hotel itself was very pleasant - the staff friendly and helpful and I can only comment on the breakfasts as this was the only meal that we had there - the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice.I would definitly recommend this hotel.Lynne vdH"
197,828,"Jan 7 2008	Spent three months in this hotel - great for business traveller	I've been working in Canary Wharf in London for four months and have spent three of those months staying in this hotel, spending four nights in the week here.Location:Excellent for the Gloucester road tube station with easy access then to the City and only one change to get across to Canary Wharf. Plenty of restaurants and bars in and around Kensington for the single business traveller to go and explore.Rooms:Have stayed in standard, executive, twin, double and family rooms, although stayed mostly in the executive rooms. Spacious enough for single traveller and even when my girlfriend stays over there is still ample space. Rooms are clean and decorated to a good standard, although some bathrooms are looking tired and in need to some repair, but on the whole rooms are good. Room Service:Friendly and efficient staff, always willing to provide meals that may differ slightly from the menu if requested. Service can be slow at peak times with waits up to one hour at times, but on average I had to wait no longer that around 30 minutes.General Facilities:The gym is of a poor size for a hotel with so many guests and can get rather busy with waits for machines, this is not ideal. Broadbadn access in the rooms is fine, but can slow down at peak times of the evening, the cost is also excessive.On the whole I would recommend this hotel for business and vacation travellers alike. I've spent three months in this hotel and would go back when travelling away on business in London."
198,828,"Jan 4 2008 	Great Stay Very Convenient	We (2 adults and 1 child 11 y/o) stayed here for a week, Dec. 27 - Jan. 2. I have to say that the room was a bit small but not uncomfortable. We had an Executive Room with a double bed and sofa bed. When the sofa bed was out there was very little room to walk around. But since the reason for opening the the sofa bed is to sleep this was not a big problem. Our only complaint would be that the sofa bed was difficult to work and required some muscle to operate. By the last couple of days we became experts at it. For us one of the best things was that even though we arrived at 8:00am the room was ready for us so we could take a nap to get over the jet lag and head out for an afternoon &amp; evening of sight-seeing so we didn't lose any time due to the time difference. The room was clean, neat and very well kept. We had the same maid all week and she kept us well supplied in complimentary juice, bottled water, and red wine. These were all in our welcome basket the first day and she restocked them every day after that. The other staff were nice and helpful, especially the concierge named Gladstone. Everytime we had a question he was there and very helpful. We ate a late dinner in the onsite pub one night. Although the menu is limited it was very good and a reasonable price. You cannot beat the location! Tube stop, internet cafes, pubs, restaurants, markets,and convenience stores all around. I have to tell you about a little place called La Liason (spelling may not be correct) right outside the tube stop and just down the block from the hotel. It was our stop every morning for a quick cup of coffee and/or breakfast. By the 3rd day the gentleman behind the counter recognized us and knew our order. The food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap. He even saw us walk by as we were heading for the tube on our way to Heathrow and came out to say goodbye. The entire area near the hotel is nice, safe and very pleasant. I would definitely stay here again. Try a restaurant called The Med. There are several in London; we ate at the one near the hotel. The food is excellent and the service great. The desserts were sinful!This hotel was very nice and served our purpose perfectly. If you plan to spend a lot of time in the room with more than two people you may want to look elsewhere or get a suite I hear they are quite large indeed. If you are a tourist who will only be in the room to sleep and shower this is the place for you. We were very comfortable."
199,828,"Jan 3 2008 	Good hotel great location	I stayed here for one night on 31st December 2007, and was very impressed with the overall experience. Coming from Cardiff, the location was perfect, as it was straight off the M4 and a short drive on the A4 before reaching the hotel. There's a tube station around the corner, and lots of nice little cafes and restaurants to choose from. Parking wasn't a problem, and cost 40 for just over 24 hours, which is reasonable considering local parking lots were charging 35 for 12 hours.Service was friendly, our room was on the highest floor (27th), but that wasn't a problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room. The room was average sized, but I'm not paying to swing a cat in a hotel room. I'm paying for comfort and convenience, which is what the hotel provided.Also, checkout is not until 12pm, which is another bonus.All in all, a very good hotel, and I will certainly stay here again on my return to London."
200,828,"Dec 28 2007	Basic but more than just okay	My husband and I chose the HIKF for our second trip to London after staying at the Millenium Gloucester on our last stay two years ago. With the ever slipping dollar value, our money did not go as far this time. Instead of an executive room with a king bed and a wonderful breakfast each day at the MG, this trip we paid more to stay at this Holiday Inn and definitely had fewer and less posh amenities.That said, we were still very happy overall with our stay. We knew the rooms were small, but ours wasn't too small.Instead of a double bed, we requested two singles and were glad we did. Just gave us a bit more room to sleep.Tiny bathroom but very clean.Our room was always cleaned very well daily.While the staff wasn't exactly friendly, they were accommodating. When we got to our first room and saw it looked a bit tired and worn, they gave us a second without hesitation.The Kensington neighborhood is absolutely the best. There are some fun pubs right around the corner.There is a supermarket and a convenience store within walking distance of the hotel.The Gloucester Street tube station is on three different lines that take you literally anywhere in London. It's simply &quot;brilliant&quot; as the Brits would say!We might stay somewhere else next time, but only because it would be fun to explore another part of this wonderful city!"
201,828,"Dec 22 2007 	Great Base for Your Stay!!!	The reviews are pretty accurate on this hotel. Apparently, Holiday Inn enjoys a premium brand identity in Europe...much different than the states. I booked my room through Priceline after requesting a four star hotel. Although the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum doesn't come close to any four star hotel I've ever seen, overall, it's a pretty nice place to stay.Hotel Service: generally speaking, the hotel staff is quite rude. but after having spent an entire week in London, I came to realize that just about anybody in the service industry is just that...rude. The hotel concierge was quite helpful on a couple of different occassions. They were able to offer insight on local restaurants, shopping, and even a barber!Hotel Ammenities: I can't comment on the workout facility as I never visited it. I also never ate a meal in the hotel. However, the Irish (or English) Pub in the hotel is quite busy and a nice place to relax at the end of the evening. The bar food actually looked pretty inviting as it passed by. I also never had breakfast/coffee at the hotel, despite the Starbucks in the lobby (and I am a Starbucks officianato). I had heard too many horror stories on coffee in London, so I stuck to hot chocolate for my daily caffeine fix. The biggest dissapointment of the hotel, in my opinion, is that they do not offer free WIFI, and they do not have a business center that allows for free internet access. How a hotel can still charge guests over $300 per night and justify charging another twenty bucks for internet access is beyond me. I can't quite recall, but I think the business center charged three pounds per half hour. That's over $6 converted...no thanks!Hotel Room: the room is just the smallest darn thing you'll ever see. It's almost comical when you first enter the room. I guess if you've traveled in London/Europe before, this is customary. But for a U.S. citizen traveling their for the first time, look out! You will be shocked!!! I was lucky to get a room on a high floor, floor #12. This reduced any noise from the Underground as the hotel is right on the Gloucester Tube stop. I actually slept well almost every night I was there. The room is generally spotless and the cleaning ladies do a great job of refilling all of the usual stuff...soap, shampoo, towels, etc. The bed was firm and comfortable and there were plenty of pillows to make a casing comfortable for you. I think it is worth noting that I did travel alone and that another person in the room would have made the living conditions somewhat difficult from a lack of space. The bathroom was generally spotless throughout. Speaking of which, there was bearly enough room to turn around in there. I think this place was designed by very small people. :) Of importance is the fact that my room key didn't work on several occassions and I had to treck all the way back down to the hotel lobby just to be greeted by an unappreciative clerk who used the same excuse each time, &quot;cell phones and credit cards can damage the magnetic strip&quot;. I told him that I was carrying the card in a separate pocket...I eventually got smart and was asking for multiple cards at a time. Before long, I think I had over ten cards in my room at one time. It at least prevented me from having to go back downstairs for another trip. Finally, there was a stench in the hallway leading up to the room that I can't quite explain. All I can say is that I would hold my breath from the elevator until I got in my room. Thankfully, the smell didn't get into the room...but it was horrid in the hallways!Location: No surprises here...it's just a great location, period. There is an Internet Cafe about a minute away that I visited virtually every day. For around 80 pence for a half hour, I was able to stay connected to the real world and get all my usual news and sporting updates. There was also a number of nice Thai and Italian restaurants in the area. Great pubs as well. You could walk down Cromwell and get to just about anywhere...Museums, Harrods, Hyde Park, etc. I actually walked to Westminster to see Parliament and Westminster Abbey (cathedral). The Gloucester Tube stop is awesome. From there, you can jump on a number of underground lines to take you anywhere in the city. There are also Waitrose (grocery), Starbucks, Burger King, KFC, and other recognizable places right outside your doorstep.What to do: I saw pretty much all the major attractions. The British Library and the British Museum are mind-boggling. Where else can you see Mozart's original compositions and the Rosetta Stone five minutes apart from eachother? Westminster Abbey is crazy impressive...until you see the dome at St. Paul's Cathedral...and then everything you've ever known or thought about history and architecture is thrown out the window...amazing! You MUST go up to the Whispering Gallery, however. From what I hear, you can go up another couple hundred steps from there...but I have a pretty intense fear of heights and had to stop. Also, the Tower of London is a fun place to spend an afternoon. Make sure to get one of the free tour guides. They are sooooo passionate about the history of the place. It dates back to 1050, so there's alot of history there. Seeing first hand how Kings and prisoners lived together is quite impressive. SOHO, Covent Garden, Marble Arch, Oxford Street, Regents Street, Picadilly Circus, West End, etc. are just amazing masses of humanity and people. It just never ends...it just goes on and on and on...I would definitely stay at this hotel again because you know what you're getting. Although I didn't think much of the hotel, I do appreciate that it didn't interfere with my trip. My purpose for traveling was to be outside of the hotel room most of the time, but have a safe, comfortable place to retreat to at the end of long days. This hotel provided that and a great location to boot!Enjoy your stay and your trip, London is awesome!"
202,828,"Dec 7 2007 	in need of refurb	the hotel is in a good location. close to Harrods and the tube. First impressions on entering the hotel are quite good. however the corridors to our room had a pungent smell of deep heat, walls were covered in marks and the gerenal appearance of public areas is dusty and old fashioned. the room we booked was an executive. all this meant was we had a standard room with a small bottle of wine, a can of coke and a kit kat to share between the two of us. the floor was worn and warped in areas. the bathroom was looking tired aswell. on complaining to reception about the state of the room we were shown another room to see if we preffered it. the second room was exactly the same. we were told the hotel was going through an 18 million refurb but they were only doing a bit at a time. we were then offered suite. however this would cost us extra. i would look for a different hotel in the same area next time i visit london."
203,828,"Dec 2 2007 	Convenient Location for Tourists	Booked a room for $150/night on priceline. The rate on the Holiday Inn website was about $350/night. Great location close to Gloucester Road tube stop. There are a number of convenience stores, bars and restaurants in the area. 28th floor of hotel has microwave, ice machine, cups, plates and utensils. Room was still a small European style room. Our room had 2 twin beds that took up about 80% of the space in the room. To create more floorspace, we shoved the beds together towards a corner (creating a large king sized bed), which significantly increased our floor space. Pillows were very flat, but maid gave us 3 pillows each. Hotel staff offered an &quot;upgrade&quot; for another 35 pounds per night which would have given us a real king sized bed plus &quot;complementary&quot; breakfast.&quot; We declined -- not sure any hotel breakfast is worth $70 a day, particularlly when there are plenty of places to eat outside the hotel. In particular, there was a nice Indian run coffee/breakfast restaurant across the street from the tube stop on Gloucester Road that served a good English breakfast at a decent price. There is also a convenience/grocery store in that area too. TV was small but workable. Room had coffee/hot water pot with tea and coffee. Internet was ridiculously expensive (15 pounds ($30)). Don't get the internet through the hotel. TMobile offers wireless throughout the entire neighborhood, so if you have wireless then just subscribe to TMobile. A full month TMobile subscription was 30 pounds (the same cost as just 2 days of wired internet throug the hotel). Would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price I got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the touristy sites in London."
204,828,"Nov 27 2007 	Fab location	Stayed here for a friday and saturday night as part of a deal to see a show at the Albert Hall.The hotel is perfectly positioned in kensington with the glouscter road tube only a 2 minute walk away.There are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby ,a waitrose and tesco express a 2 minute walk away.The hotel is high rise, 27 floors high we had a fantastic view from the 16th floor right across the city it was beautiful at night and also watching the sun rise.Nearby Albert hall is about a 10 minute walk and Harrods about 30 mins.The room was spotlessly clean and in good repair and also being a light sleeper i found it to be very quiet considering the hotel was so large.We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening only at breakfast which was okay, very busy but well organised.The Staff were very helpful and always happy to help.All in all a great place to stay for a getaway break in london (try and a room on a higher floor overlooking the city it is worth it!)"
205,828,"Nov 24 2007 	Four words-Starbucks in the lobby!!!!	My mother and I visited in the spring. The room was as expected for a Holiday Inn-cute little fridge with lots of goodies, a teapot, comfortable beds, clean, neatly renovated bathroom, plenty of hot water, overall pleasant. Heavy doors and thin walls made for a bit of a noise issue, but not excessive. The restaurant was a bit overpriced for dinner, but a pleasant experience. It was nice to be able to come back to the hotel, rest for a minute, then just go have a drink in the hotel pub in the evening. Service was impeccably English hotel-wide. Booking a tour to Windsor/Stonehenge through the concierge was a breeze. Convenient to Gloucester Road tube station--location could not have been better. Neighborhood was scenic and we felt safe. GREAT Indian restaurant nearby."
206,828,"Nov 24 2007 	Great Location	Hotel 2 minute walk to underground. Great location with cafes, restaurants and grocery stores all around. Rooms are a little small but we were out all day so it didnt bother us. If you keep the room tidy its not a problem. Didn't eat at the restaurant as it was overpriced. If you like Indian food we ate at the Dehli Brassiere it was exellent and more reasonably priced. Fire alarm did go off a 2 in the morning and stood outside for half an hour. Other than that we had a great time would stay there again. As a side note its a 4 star hotel for London but for the states its more like a 2 1/2."
207,828,"Nov 20 2007 	Good hole - solid	I thought the hotel was decent. Thought the rooms were small but workable. Non-smoking room and floor was actually non-smoking! what a concept. Usualy i still smell smoke from somewhere , even on the non-smoking rooms, not this time.cons:Tv was really small and didn't work that well. The concierge was helpful and booked me a taxi that was less than the standard fare. . Front desk was a bit unorganized, had some trainees, computer system wasn't working properly on initial check indidn't try the breakfast or the restaurant.All in all a clean room, great location near hyde park and all the stuff in kensington/chelea, near tube station , quiet area."
208,828,"Nov 17 2007	Very nice hotel	The hotel was booked through a cruise line (NCL) as part of a 1 night pre-cruise stay and included transfer to the port. Our room was very clean, although a bit small . But for 1 night it was fine. We had dinner in the hotel and had a very nice meal."
209,828,Nov 16 2007 	Average	Stayed here for business.Average choice of dinner venues near by.Signs are lacking to get to it from Gloucester Road tube station. I ended up walking around the whole building (tired and with bags) to get to reception. Who then asked for payment when it is billed straight back to my travel agents. Fortunately for the only time in my life I had been near a printer and had printed out the confirmation which he grumpily copied and accepted.Room was acceptable.
210,828,Oct 29 2007 	Great location clean and quiet	Booked hotel through priceline so didn't get to choose property(paid $136 a night which was about half price compared to online rates) . Was concerned because don't usually stay at holiday inn and read some of the negative reviews. Was listed on priceline as 4 star but on other sites as 3 star. I would say it was a great 3 star hotel. Hotel was excellent. Staff very friendly and I always worry when booking through priceline that I will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye. Hotel was able to give us a two bed non-smoking room which is exactly what we wanted. Room was very quiet. Rooms are small but clean. Location is excellent to the tube stations.
211,828,"Oct 29 2007 	Very Nice Hotel	Stayed here for business , first room was very small but after they changed my room it was fine. Can't fault the hotel"
212,828,"Oct 28 2007 	ok for a one night stop	I spent 6 days and 5 nights here on a work course. Rooms are okay but very small and it took two days for them to change the valance on the bed after I complanied ( do not ask why, but you can guess!!).I also got a phone call in the room on the second day from a strange man asking if I had found an ear ring which was lost that day in my room. This left me a bit nervous as I was staying on my own. The breakfast is self service on the first floor, not cheap ( about 14) but not bad either as there is plenty of choice. Just make sure you eat as much as you can for the price you have paid. I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen/re-heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it. The card which is left for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes.The good thing about this hotel is its location, you are a 10 minute walk from Harrods and 13 taxi ride to Covent Garden which will take you past all the tourist attractions: Buckingham Palace, No1: London etc."
213,828,"Oct 18 2007 	Delivered on all counts	Stayed 4 nights in early October. I found the hotel was clean and attracted a mix of leisure and business travellers (including some airline personnel). Loved the location as it's only a 1-minute walk from the Gloucester Road tube station. From there you can take the Circle, District or Piccadilly lines which provide easy access to many of the major sights in London. My room (standard 2 single-bed) came with a mini-fridge which was great as I could stock up on beverages, yogurts, fruit etc from the Waitrose (next door to the tube station) and keep them cool. There is also a 24-hr Tesco Express across from the tube station if you need something after 9:00pm. Neighbourhood is very safe and there are many other hotels in the immediate vicinity. There was no iron/ironing board in the room (typical for Europe), but the concierge had one sent up within an hour. Bathroom was comparable to an average North American hotel, which means fairly big for Europe. Standard-size bathtub and the shower had good water pressure. My rate did not include breakfast but I pre-bought English Breakfast buffet vouchers at check-in for 10.95 pounds each instead of the 14.95 pounds you'll pay if you just rock up at the Forum room in the morning. Breakfast was good and consistent, with newspapers provided to skim through as you eat. I really had no complaints about my stay at all. I guess it's a bit antiseptic culturally (vs a B&amp;B) but I was OK with that. For my first visit to London my top priorities were easy Tube access, a safe, upscale neighbourhood and a clean room with proper bathroom. This hotel delivered on all counts"
214,828,"Oct 6 2007 	Bad customer experience	My stay at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum was one of the worst travel experiences that I have had. I was initially booked in to the Holiday Inn Regents Park, but on arrival at 10.30pm I was told that the system had crashed, cancelling my booking in a deluxe room. No apology was given and I was taken to the Holiday Inn Kensington Park in a paid for cab (which the staff member at Regents Park had not paid enough for). Upon arrival at Kensington, the staff seemed friendly enough. However, the first price that they charged me was too much so I had to get a refund then be charged the correct amount for a standard room. This was still the same rate as a deluxe room in the previous hotel. My room was clean with tea and coffee making facilities, but there was wallpaper coming away from the walls and there was no cover on the bed, simply a duvet in a white sheet.My experience has been made a lot worse by the fact that having checked my bank balance, I have seen that the Holiday Inn Kensington has charged me 3 TIMES for my stay with them, amounting to over 500 for one night!!!!!! I have been told that the accounts dept only work Monday to Friday and so I am going to have to wait until Monday to receive a 400 refund. Forunately I had enough money in my account but am now left with no funds for the weekend. Not impressed by their customer care at all - NOT ONE SINGLE APOLOGY.I will be very reluctant to use another Holiday Inn again."
215,828,"Oct 5 2007 	Nice hotel for the odd nights stay	Pro's:- Ask for an upgrade your most probably get one.Excellent views over London from the 10th floor up.Friendly receptionCleanCons: - smallish roomsOld style bar/pubNo ventilation on a smoking floorIt's not worth the hotel web-site price of 160 for STD room.Advice: - Book through lastminute.com as one of there Top Secret Hotels. It doesn't take a genius to work out which hotel you're booking and cost 79.We stayed over for one night on 28 Sept 2007. I originally asked for a room above the 10th floor looking over London but that side of the hotel was fully booked so got and upgrade to an executive room. The room was still small with barely enough room between the bed and dressing table but it did have a sofa and complementary half bottle of wine, fruit juice, water, and chocolate bar (at the hotels prices this would of cost of over 20 - Chocolate bar is 3.50!!!!). The reception was friendly and helpful. After our night out we went to the bar which is a bit dark with Sky sports on the TV (which suited me my friends fine but not to my wife and her friends liking).In short it's a good hotel if you get the price off lastminute.com (79) and not the hotel web-site price of 160. Clean and Friendly but I would only stay the odd night, it would drive me crazy to stay there for more than two nights in a row."
216,828,"Oct 5 2007 	No improvement	I have written a previous report on this hotel (about a month ago), well things have not changed. I was booked into the same room as the one I complained about last time and the TV is still not fixed! I complained again and the this time (after about 1 hr) the repair man said &quot;it is broken&quot; and I will replace it. He came back about 30 mins. later (bear in mind this is now 10.30 pm) and started to replace the TV, the fire alarm went off and he run out of the room leaving the trolley in the room, the TV not installed. Upon returning to the room after the false alarm, he was nowhere to be seen, so I connected the TV up and put the trolley outside the room.As to the organisation of the fire evacuation, it was a laughable as the last time I suffered one, no one was directing you to the assembly points (I am ok as I know the hotel), people milling around the stairs and people leaving the bar to go outside and sitting on the bar tables outside next to the fire escape doors. I like this hotel due to its location, but the management need to get a grip."
217,828,Oct 2 2007	pre-cruise hotel	WE booked this hotel through our cruiseline as a package deal.It was a great place to stay pre-cruise. It was close to the tube and to the bus line. also had pubs and a Tesco's close by.We had no problems. The free breakfast was good and enough to keep you going for a while. Transportation from there to dover was good.
218,828,"Oct 1 2007 	An ok Hotel if you get a room at a discounted rate.	Booked this hotel for four nights in London. Its in an easy location from the tube, just two minutes walk. Its also close to lots of restaurants and some supermarkets. The hotel itself is in need of an upgrade, its getting a bit tired, but saying that, the room was clean. The airconditioning is pretty amazing, it can make the room very cool if that's what you like (good in a London summer). The room was on the small side, but had a great view of North London (we were on the 16th floor). The bathroom was ok, however there seemed to be a lack of water pressure, so the shower was a kin to standing under a tap. Check in took time, because there had been a lot of early check ins that day and they didn't have a room for us. However five minutes later one appeared. Check out took just as long and all I had to do was pay the 15 quid for internet. The woman went off and came back 20 minutes later. Goodness knows what she was doing."
219,828,"Sep 20 2007 	Great Priceline find	I booked a room for 5 days for $120 USD per night (plus taxes) on Priceline. The hotel has an unbeatable location in a very nice part of South Kensington - only 1 block from the Gloucester Road station (Circle and District lines). You can buy drinks and breakfast food at a Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door. The outside is hideous - 27 stories that blight the London skyline - but the inside is bright, fresh, relatively new and much nicer than your average US Holiday Inn. The rooms are decent sized for London (see photo) - and all seem to be of identical size (most have 2 twin beds). The beds are comfy enough, and the furniture is light colored and relatively new. There is a small fridge to keep drinks, but no mini-bar. The bathroom is bright and clean, with a modern tub and good water pressure. The AC is great, and all rooms have large windows. The service is pleasant enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London (photo) on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline. An absolute steal for $120 per night - you can pay the same for terrible dumps in London. However, the rack rate is much higher. I would gladly stay here again."
220,828,"Sep 20 2007	Expensive	Since four years I stay at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum whilst I visit PLASA. A Tradeshow at the Earlscourt Exhibition centre. This year a paid GBP 888,00 (approx. $ 1.800) for 2 rooms for 2 nights. As a priority club member I expected to have a decent room but this was not the case. The room was extremely small. The minibar was empty. According to the frontdesk employee this was normal because too many people were using the minibar without paying. But, she said, if I wanted some drinks in the minibar she could arrange that for me. It never happened during our two day stay. The location of the hotel is fine and actually the hotel is not extremely bad but it is extremely EXPENSIVE."
221,828,"Sep 11 2007 	Good for tourists; so-so for business travelers	I stayed here on my first vacation to London, so my requirements for the room and hotel weren't great. It is one block away from an Underground stop, which is tremendously convenient. Room was small but adequate as I basically used the room to sleep in. A/C worked fine. Housekeeping showed up every day. The only meals I had were the continental breakfast they threw in for the price, so I don't know how good the restaurants in the hotel are. The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that. Also had a Starbucks and Tesco Express near by. As a tourist, I thought it was a good place. If I had to stay here for business for a few days, I don't think I would rate it as high as the amenities for business travelers weren't as great."
222,828,"Sep 10 2007 	Extremely happy	I spend more time living in hotels than I do at my own home, so as a rule I try to stay in the same hotel, if returning to the same area. I will certainly be using the Kensington Forum again when I am back in London.This break was for leisure and to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary, so I wanted to ensure it went smoothly. I'd arranged a suite at the hotel and the usual extra's,including flowers, etc.The staff were extremely attentive, polite and made the check-in process very smooth, considering we arrived at quite a busy period.I appreciate that we had a large room so it's difficult for me to comment on comfort of the standard room's, however, the mentality we have is we'd rather spend time exploring, so the size of the room isn't necessarily important. All of the hotel facilities met our expectations and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel to my friends and family.We didn't eat in the hotel, again primarily due to me living on hotel meals, so I couldn't comment on the quality of the restaurants, however, considering your in London there is no shortage of restaurants to eat at and meet every type of budget. Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station (Gloucester Road) you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do!!!!!!!There's obviously loads of hotels in London and I've always stuck to the Intercontinental chain where possible. This hotel hasn't got everything right, but equally, which hotel does? I'd therefore be happy to return to the Kensington Forum again and if anyone out there has any questions about this hotel, please feel free to ask."
223,828,"Sep 9 2007 	A/C was down but would still stay here again	We've stayed in London a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors - the location, the price &amp; the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults.We managed to get a Saturday night stay in the heart of the British Summer for approx 115 exc breakfast through the hotel-chain's own website which I consider a good deal.The hotel itself is truly in a great location - on the same road as the major London museums it took a leisurely 5-10 minutes to stroll to the wonderful Natural History Museum &amp; a further 5-10 minutes up the road to Harrods. The tube stop is 2 minutes from the hotel and driving to the hotel from the M4 could not be simpler.The hotel itself is very large with it's own underground car park and a very light and airy lobby which was very nice. The rooms were all modern although for an Executive Room all you basically get extra is a bottle of water, orange juice and robe (which you can't keep of course). Our room was more than comfortable for two but when me made up the third bed the room was incredibly cramped - then again this is Central London !Our major annoyance was that on one of the genuinely super-hot days of the British Summer the air conditioning wasn't working on several floors, including ours and the hotel was totally fully-booked. This was extremely frustrating at the time however in fairness they did provide three of us with full breakfasts the next morning which we have to say were as good as any we've had in most major hotels.Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website - VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room - this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before - we ended up paying 17 more per night than I'd expected.Despite the above problems I would recommend a stay here, price dependant. If we hadn't experienced a problem with the a/c I would have rated my overall stay here 5/5 for value, location, comfort, etc."
224,828,"Sep 1 2007	Sub par Hoilday Inn	We booked our room thru Hotwire for 6 nights at a cost of US$240 per night. We have travelled all over, Orient (Japan is famous for small rooms), Middle East and Europe. However, this is our first trip to England and have to say this hotel is THE WORST we have ever stayed in around the globe. Location itself is great, but everything else is terrible. Check in took 3 tries after an exhausting 2 weeks cruise and a 3 hour bus ride. Yes, we were early to check in at 1pm, went back at 3pm, and then at 6pm just to check in. for a non smoking room, had numerous cigarette burn marks on table and carpet. None of the table and floor lamps will stand straight. The TV is so small that I wouldn't even put it in my basement laundry room. For 3 of the 6 nights, housekeeping purposely only leave one set of towel for a family of 3 (despite us writing them notes), just so that they can collect more tips by bringing things to you. Carpet was never vaccuumed for the entire week. This is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality. don;t stay here unless if the Kensington location is important to you."
225,828,"Aug 26 2007 	OK hotel - but it's a zoo!	Geat location, clean, relatively quiet inside the rooms, somewhat confortable. Check-in was an ordeal because the lobby was always so crowded. The harried staff did the best they could but there were just too many people who needed help! Eat somewhere else for breakfast; they charge you 14 pounds for their mediocre breakfast. Everything from there except for the eggs and sausages looked like it came from a can. But the lower level bar and restaurant areas seemed just fine. Not sorry I stayed there but I'll look elsewhere next time."
226,828,"Aug 14 2007 	Our preferred choice	We have stayed here two or three times a year since the early 1990s. The main reasons are location and the quality of the air conditioning. This is the only hotel we have stayed in in London where the air-conditioning works effectively, and in high summer it is a great relief to escape the heat. Yes, the standard rooms are small for two people (and I would certainly not recommend them for three) and, yes, they seem to have a lot of trainee staff at the front desk, who struggle sometimes with the language, and yes some of the rooms are affected by traffic noise, but for a good location and a no-frills room provider, it is hard to beat. (Contrary to one of the other reviews, the hotel is not close to Victoria train station.)"
227,828,Jul 28 2007 	just so so	we stayed 10 nites here . location is good . housekeeping kept forgetting that we were 3 in a room. they would forget to leave towels for the 3rd person with us from time to time. it was very hard to move around the room when the sofa bed was pulled out ; as another reviewer said you'd have to crawl to move around . as for cleanliness it was okay. as for the continental breakfast taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed. it was mostly the same every day. they could at least change some of the fruits ( mostly watermelon and honeydew) or bread served .however the staff did try to be helpful when their attention was called . i believe things could still be improved.
228,828,"Jul 23 2007	Great hotel!	Bought the room for about 1/2 price using Hotwire. (listed on Hotwire as 3-star hotel in Kensingtion) Clean rooms, bustling lobby, GREAT location. (1 block from the Kensington South tube station.) The neighborhood was super cute! We bought double-decker bus tickets from the consierge, and the bus stop for it was very close. Enjoyable stay!"
229,828,"Jul 23 2007 	Excellent London Hotel	This exceeded our expectations for a London Hotel. We booked it through a special rate advertised in the newspaper.The rooms were clean, spacious, very good beds, choice of pillows,relatively qiuet. Close to tube station and in a nice, safe part of London.We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good - although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night. Breakfasts were very good - a buffet with a selection of fruit, yoghurt and whole cereals to 'full english'.We booked a non-smoking room and sadly were bothered by others on the non-smoking floor who smoked in the room. This wafted out into the hallway and into other rooms. Calls to the desk, resulted in a series of slammed doors for an hour after they were spoken too - security could have done a better job with this!Depsite this, we would stay there again."
230,828,"Jul 19 2007 	Clean and comfortable	I've stayed several times at this hotel and overall had a good experience. The rooms are a reasonable size, clean and modern. I like having a comfortable bed, a fridge, a choice of pillows and a shower that works well. The rooms that overlook the railway lines can be a little noisy, otherwise I haven't been disturbed by external noise. Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english. The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good; I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did. As many of the reviews state, the hotel is close to the tube and there are lots of restaurants, supermarkets etc nearby to supply most needs. Don't buy the bottled water from the hotel - go to the supermarket and get it for half the price! Another tip - if you are going to use the tube for more than a day or so, consider getting an Oystercard for cheaper travel."
231,828,"Jul 10 2007 	Stay Away From The Holiday Inn London Forum.	We spent the months of Dec., 2006 and June, 2007 in UK and Italy. This hotel was adequate for 1 night in Dec, but it was not a good place to stay in June.Out of all of the hotels we stayed at, some great and some good, this was the worst of all of them. Bellhops don't come to get your luggage until you have wheeled it to the doors, breakfast was good in Dec but terrible in June. Don't bother wasting your money on their breakfast, unless it is included in the cost of the room. The rooms are tiny, even by European Standards. We couldn't even get our luggage out of our way so that we could access the bed from the side.If you are used to staying at an American Holiday Inn, perhaps this hotel is the same. Except the charge is $300-$400 per night."
232,828,"Jul 8 2007 	Nothing great	I stayed at this hotel for 4 night in the first week of July. I paid ~110 pounds/night through lastminute.com top secret deals. Lastminuterated this hotel as 4*, although it should be rated a 3*. The hotel is conveniently located near the Gloucester Road underground station.You can take the underground from the airport to this station and would only cost you 4 pounds (Piccadilly Line). My room had a queen bed, TV, A/C, boiler pot, coffee/tea sachets, and mini fridge. There is only wired Internet available and it's expensive. The bathroom was modest in size and had a tub. Room and bathroom were clean. The decor of the hotel and the rooms looks cheapand not worth the money I was paying. My room rate did not include the morning breakfast buffet. At the time of check-in I purchased a buffet voucher for one day for 10 pounds. The buffet is awful and I am glad that I only bought for a single day.The front desk staff was courteous and heeded to my request for a room on the top floor (19th floor) with a view. Overall, my stay went without any problems, however, I won't pay 110 pounds to stay here. Not a good value for money."
233,828,"Jul 3 2007 	Avoid staying here if possible	My advise to you is, if possible avoid staying at this place. I was on a business trip to the London, UK area and was booked to stay at this hotel for 4 days. Here are some of the terrible features that I noticed: It takes about 20+ minutes to get to talk to someone at the front desk. If you are standing at the front desk, the folks behind the counter pretend that they have not seen you. I've seen travellers with bags, kids, babies wait for up to 30minutes before being attended to. On the first night of my stay, I tried to use room service. It took 3 calls to get to the right person...the operator answers the phone when she pleases or your wait time to get your call answered is about 2minutes. When the food arrive (after about 45mins) it was the wrong order...it took another hour for the correct order to be delivered. I can also tell you that there is nothing fantastic about the food...just bare aveage. On my second day, I got news that my stay would need to be extended. I went to the front desk and talked to the person on duty...he could not find my reservation at all. I was surprised to learn that, because I was staying at the hotel. A duty manager figured out the problem (as usual...it was computer related) and assured me that I could extend my stay without any issues...the only thing I had to do was to tell them on the morning of the 4th day that I needed to stay longer. On the third night I tried room service again...this time nothing arrived. Room service pesonnel called me up after about 45minutes asking if I really needed the stuff that I had ordered. Isnt that wonderful? I later learnt that there was a shift change and the person who took the order just vanished into thin air leaving no trace of my order!! On the fourth day I went down to let the front desk personnel know that I need extension....the hell broke lose. The lady at the front desk wanted me to vacate...she said I could not be accomodated for an additional 3 days, but I could be accomodated for an additional 5 days. Why would I want to take on additional 5 days when I have to travel back after 3. The hotel folks are just trying to maximize occupancy and by forcing me to take on 5 day, they can charge me early departure fees. The worst nightmare was talking to the front desk people...half of them dont understand proper English. The folks who understand english are sort of rude...the atmosphere is such that they are always right and that a customer is doing them a service by staying at the hotel. I had to get into some very tight discussions with the front desk folks...three visits to the evasive duty manager...who ironically never wanted to come and talk to me and a 2 hour wait at the front desk granted me an extension. Is this the level of customer service you want? The lady supposedly asssisting me could not give me rate info...I had to work all the math for her so that both of us could understand what we are looking at. Absolutely pathetic.If you choose to visit the coffee shop on the ground level be prepared for some rude talk and possibly not getting items that they advertise they have. During my 9 day stay at the hotel, I visited the coffee shop 3 times...on two occasions the product that they have listed on their boards are not available. The response is very curt as well..&quot;we dont have it, come back tomorrow&quot;.On my last day I used the concierge service to arrange a cab for me. I visited the desk to arrange the booking and thought it was done. Later in the evening I double checked with the desk only to find that the time I wanted the cab was not captured at all....brilliant service isnt it?If you use wake up call service...be prepared for the phone to go off a million times at night. There is no way you can turn off the device...nor an operator to talk to, because like I mentioned before operator anwers the call only when he/she thinks it is appropriate.During my stay, I had to talk to 3 managers...the first one promised me that he would get back. Till date that has not happened. The second manager has not responsed either. The third manager I talked to routed me to the Sales Manager...I beleive she is working on addressing the problems.Recommendation: Avoid this place if you can. It will make your trip much better. I understand that Holiday Inn group recently bought this place...so they are still learning how to manage the place. I will NOT recommend this location...in fact I have asked folks at work not to use this place for any business related travel going forward."
234,828,"Jun 25 2007 	Excellent value and location	This review is very extremely belated. I travelled during the off-season in January to London, this was my first stay at this location and I would definitely consider doing so again. Service: The staff at the Forum were all very nice and professional, although it is true that we never asked them for any special requests. Therefore, I cannot comment on how they handle special requests or complaints, for we had none. Housekeeping came daily and did a great job!Rooms: Very Americanized! The rooms were larger than any other hotel I have seen in Europe. They came complete with a small fridge (Not stocked), American outlets, work area, telephone, comfy beds, and television, as well as a moderate sized bathroom. We were pleased with the rooms.Food: We never ate at the pub downstairs. However, a continental breakfast was included in the price and had a fairly large selection. Whereas there was a full breakfast available at a charge, we never took advantage of it. There were a number of restaurants in the area.The area: Less than a five minute walk from the tube station and within walking distance to the Museum of Natural History, really a good location.Overall: We paid less that $100/night for the room inclusive of continental breakfast. I don't remember the exact amount, but it was cheap, especially considering the neighborhood and the good shape of the hotel. We did travel during the off-season, so I am sure rates go up throughout the busy months. We were very pleased."
235,828,"Jun 24 2007 	Superb	This is the best 3 star hotel I've ever stayed in. A lot of 3 stars I've stayed at in London have been shabby with cramped rooms, with a complacent atmosphere of &quot;we're in the middle of the capital so we don't need to try&quot;. The Kensignton Forum was a refreshingly different experience - bright, airy, and modern, with friendly and helpful staff. Our room was clean, spacious and smart. The shower worked properly, was nice and powerful and stayed at a consistent temperature - something that a lot of hotels can't seem to achieve. There was a great range of toiletries provided, plus bathrobes and slippers. Breakfast was excellent - it was buffet but tasted freshly cooked (and they had black pudding!). The hotel is within easy walking distance of lots of attractions, including the Royal Albert Hall, where we spent the evening. Thanks to writers of previous reviews that helped us decide to go for this hotel."
236,828,"Jun 21 2007 	Great Location	We( my wife, Kid and I) stayed at Kensington Forum in the month of May 2007 for a week. This is our second visit to London. Our flight reached early ( by 7.15 in the morning) and my hotel reservation was technically from 2.00 PM that afternoon. We decided that we will take the chance of asking the hotel for an early check in as it was quite a challenge to manage a 3 year old until 2 in the afternoon, especially after a long flight. Lucky for us-- the front desk accomodated our request. Our observation about the hotel was as follows:Getting to the Hotel: The easiest and the cheapest way would be by Tube. The hotel is probably 100ft from the Gloucester Rd tube station. From Heathrow it is 4 pounds/ person.Lobby:-- Decent lobby size with a resturant. Nothing fancy.Room Size:--Compared to US hotels, the rooms were very cramped. Two people couldn't walk within the room at the same time but I guess that is a problem with most hotels in Europe. Space is of constraint.Centralized AC:-- Yes but there is a problem with the AC. The maintenance people will shut off the AC and you will have to call the lobby and complaint about it before the turn it on again. I have seen couple other people in the forum complain saying that the AC is not working. Actually the management is trying to conserve electricity and shut of the AC by midnight or early morning. I think that is bad service.Location:-- The one thing this hotel has it going for it is the location. Most of London attractions are in Zone 1 and 2. Between Zone1 &amp; 2 the round trip tube cost is about 6 pounds/person. Most of the places can be covered by the Tube and one can always get rail pass.With a kid and a stroller, this definitely is a very convenient location.The hotel is on Cromwell and Gloucester Rd. Cromwell is a pretty posh and popular location. They say that if one keeps going west on Cromwell, it can take you to Heathrwow and technically speaking it can take you to Wales.About 10 mins walk on cromwell, you will hit the museum Triangle. The museum Triangle has Vicotria Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the History Museum.Resturants: There are quite a few resturants and diners near by. There is a also a Burger King, KFC and a Starbucks. Since the dollar to pound conversion is not all that great, none of them turn out to be cheap when one travels from the US. Breakfast Alternative:As against having continental breakfast in the resturant, this time around we carried couple cereal boxes. We then brought can of milk from the local grocery store. Less than 5 mins walk from the hotel, there is a grocery chain called Tesco. Tesco is like Korger, Jewel or any other US chain--just that it is smaller in size.Travelling out of London: The hotel arranges for trips to Bath,Stonehenge and other places. The conceirege was very helpful. While travelling out of London to any of the popular destinations, food can be pretty expensive. One suggestion is to buy sandwich box from Tesco( grocery chain). It cost 78 pence per sandwich box....much much cheaper than eating out.Getting back to the airport: If your flight is at 8.00 in the morning, unfortunately tube is not an option. The tube only starts by 5.45 in the morning and it takes 45 mins to reach Heathrow. There is a shuttle service for 34 pounds which needs to be booked one day ahead and plys only every half hour. Choice comes down to Taxi which costs 40 pounds as against 4 pounds by Tube. I heard that when the concerige calls for a cab, the cab driver has to pay 10 pounds to the hotel.I can write a little more but I am starting to get bored. Hope the review helps."
237,828,"Jun 21 2007 	A fine hotel and great location	The rooms here are clean and no smaller than any comparable London hotel. The advantages are proximity to two 24-hour supermarkets, plus a Waitrose, good pubs, and the Underground. The lobby is well-appointed and there are many good alternatives to the hotel restaurant. Overall an excellent place to be based for work -or recreational-stays in London."
238,828,"Jun 20 2007 	Excellent Value and Location	My wife and I stayed here June 10-16, 2007. We could not have been happier with the location or the room for the price. It is a great value. As others have said, it is across from the Gloucester tube and walking distance to Old Brompton Road with dozens of great restaurants. While more money will certainly buy one more luxury, for its affordability it certainly met all our expectations with a clean and comfortable room. In the end, when in London you don't spend much time in your hotel."
239,828,"Jun 15 2007 	Great location indifferent service	Stayed here for five days with my son. This being our first ever visit to UK, must say the location of the hotel, just 2min walk from Glousceter Rd tube stn was a great advantage as even during the weekend, Piccadely line remained open, though distict and central lines had some restrictions on a/c of maintainence etc. We had no problem accessing most attractions by tube. About the hotel, the first room given to us was having stained and patchy carpet and the duvet was also stained. When I pointed this to the reception, they changed my room promptly with an apology. The second room's phone did not work, whicch was again changed immediately after reporting.Housekeeping is very indifferent. One has to ask for everythingg leterally everyday. A bother really when one comes back after whole day and finds that even shampoos or toothpastes etc. have not been replenished. This went on for our whole stretch of stay."
240,828,Jun 9 2007 	Good value and excellent location	Not ultra posh place but excellent if you're looking for a very nice and reasonably priced place within central London. The rooms have never disappointed and the food is always nice. The menu isn't extensive though and they dont have more than one restaurant but you are surrounded by very nice cafes and restaurants which aren't a long walk. Its located about 2 minutes from the Gloucester road tube station so brilliant if you need to be close to the underground. The staff are veru nice and it's baby friendly. TIP: If you're looking for something more upmarket then there is a posher and more expensive Holiday Inn over the road. There is hardly any difference though overall. Personally i would stick to the Kensington Forum.
241,828,"Jun 1 2007 	Great Place to Stay for the Money	As a college student I was looking for a cheap place to stay that was also not a hostel or a gross budget hotel. Booking through Priceline led me to the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum which was inexpensive, in a great location, and clean and comfortable. We stayed at the Holiday Inn for about a week and the room was clean and quiet. Yes, the rooms are small but most hotel rooms are small in Europe so this was not a surprise. The decor is bright and modern and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom is tiny but at least there is a bathroom attached to the room; in a lot of hotels that I looked at online in the same price range, bathrooms were not en suite. One thing of note is that the hair dryer is under the desk and not in the bathroom. The location of the hotel is great because it's about a block from the Gloucester Road Tube Station which is on several Tube lines. The hotel is also near a local pub (The Stanhope Arms) as well as two grocery stores and several restaurants. There is also a video/internet cafe that we used to communicate with family down the street--it looks a little sketchy from the outside but inside it's ok and the prices were reasonable. In short, the location of the hotel made travel around London and getting to train stations to go out of London incredibly easy. Also, we never felt unsafe walking around the neighborhood very early in the morning or late at night.We never ate at the restaurants inside the hotel because the prices were very expensive. We did get drinks often in the pub attached to the hotel although it's not the place to go if you want the traditional British pub experience (we went for the convenience if we were too tired to go out.)I would stay here again because in London it really is a value for the service and quality of room."
242,828,"Jun 1 2007 	Good Value	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum in Mid-May for 3 nights. We found this high-rise hotel to be very clean and have a decent size room and bathroom. The hotel was located about 1 1/2 blocks from the tube stop and near several cafes, pubs, restaurants, and shops. Peter the Concierge was great...very helpful and provided several suggestions for tourists. The only issue we had was with the air conditioning not working properly. Once we notified the front desk, the problem was resolved quickly. Overall, we felt this hotel was in a convenient location and a good deal for a London hotel."
243,828,"May 29 2007 	Functional Efficient and Well-Managed	Large hotels in London can very often be a real let-down - but on this occasion The Holiday Inn did not disappoint, even though it was an exceptionally busy period (Chelsea Flower Show). The hotel occupies an entire block on Cromwell Road, and is just a short distance from Gloucester Road Underground Station. Standard bedrooms are very compact, but well equipped, and housekeeping standards are high. Despite its size, and the fact that there are over 20 floors of bedrooms, lift service was never slow, and the breakfast operation (in The Forum Room on the first floor) is exceptionally well-managed. Unfortunately the bar/restaurant in the lobby area closes (relatively) early, and at the time of visiting the 'English-style' pub was unappealing with its noisy and smoky atmosphere. The prices for the in-room mini-bar however were reasonable for a London hotel."
244,828,"May 28 2007 	Nice Stay and Location	Have stayed here before, this was my third/fourth time. As other reviewers mentioned, good location and lots around to do/eat/see/enjoy. I always stay here, when in London. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
245,828,"May 26 2007	Nice hotel with great location	I stayed at the Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum from May 10-May17th. The location is excellent, just a half a block from the Glouster Rd. Tube station. The Victoria and Albert Museum is about a mile down Cromwell and about 2 miles farther on Cromwell is Harrods.The room was clean clean. The only problem I had was there was a stain on the bed cover and one stain on the carpet near the bed. The maid service was good and everything was cleaned and tidied. The concierge was efficient at booking my bus tour. The tour buses pick up at the Holiday Inn which is convenient. One thing that isn't mentioned when booking the tours is that the bus that picks you up takes customers, regardless of which tour they have booked, to the Victoria Coach Station. At Victoria Station the passengers get line according to which tour they have booked. Also, the tour bus most likely will not drop you off at your hotel after the tour, but rather at Victoria Station or some location nearest your hotel as the bus driver can get."
246,828,"May 21 2007 	Great Stay	The previous positive reviews of this hotel were right on the money. The rooms are small but very clean and quiet. The lobby is spacious and checking in and out was so easy. Also, the close location of the gloucester road tube stop is great for getting around all of london. I would highly recommend calling ahead a day or two and requesting a room on one of the higher floors. We did and the staff was nice enough to give us a room on the 21st floor with incredible views of downtown. I would stay at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum again in a hearbeat!"
247,828,"May 20 2007 	very convenient location	Slow check in at 3am in the morning not really appreciated! Very small twin bed room. Had booked a double room. Barely enough room to walk past the bed. Tiny bathroom. No room for anyone with more than a couple of pieces of luggage. Average hotel room - nothing out of the ordinary. Have stayed in other hotels in London and had larger rooms but know small rooms are par for the course in London. Relatively quiet. Great location - a couple of minutes walk from Gloucester Rd underground station, and shops, restaurants, internet cafe etc"
248,828,"May 17 2007 	Good Hotel	Stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights on business, a nice hotel, good buffet english breakfast. Room was ok. Only complaint was there was no trouser press but an ironing board &amp; iron was supplied."
249,828,"May 16 2007 	Great location but don't bring the car!	Stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for one night on a business trip. Check in was prompt, and the room clean and tidy, a bit small, but this is central London. Minor problem with the TV dealt with quickly and efficiently. The location is great however, only 5 mins walk from the Gloucester Road tube and 10 mins walk to the South Kensington museums, Albert Hall, etc. Breakfast was OK, great choice, but the cooked food was a bit tepid.Main gripe was the cost of the car park - 35 per 24 hours, so I'd look at alternatives if you are driving in."
250,828,"May 14 2007 	Fine for the price	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum from May 6 - 12/07. We booked it fairly cheaply (well by London standards anyway!) on [--]for 470UK. The hotel is in an ok location - close the the Gloucester Rd tube station. There are a few shops etc in the area. I had a bit of an odd reception. My friend had flown in a couple of hours earlier and had left a key in an envelope with my name on at reception. I got there tired (not surprising with an overnight flight from Toronto!) and asked is she had checked in. After a bit of nonsense from the desk clerk, she finally called my friend in the room. She told them about key etc and the desk clerk couldn't (really wouldn't) find the envelope. After more fussing about she finally gave me a key to the elevator to meet up with my friend. Talk about brain dead desk clerks. yikes. Oh well. This was just a shopping trip with friend, so I will put up with a bit more at a budget hotel. The room is very small, which is fairly typical for London. Think cruise ship cabin. The room had two single beds, one table in the middle and a desk. There was a small closet and a small bathroom. Bring your own soap and toiletries! There was the smallest bar of soap I have ever seen and only liquid hand soap. There is a dispenser in the bath for soap/shower gel, which is useless. There was no hand lotion or anything else. Strictly budget stuff. This hotel caters mainly to AA flight crew and package tours. The day I checked in there was a large cruise ship group from NCL, staying in London the day before the cruise. We didn't eat in the hotel as it is very expensive for what you get. We did go to the pub onsite a few times. The first night it was a bank holiday, so it was very quiet. The last night we went in it was a Thursday, and we were talking to several people, who said it was their local (a bit surprising given that it is a hotel bar) and lots of AA flight crew. Our table of two wound up growing to eight, having a lively mix of locals and flight attendants. A G &amp; T was a shocking 5.40UK. The tube was handy as it had the Picadilly, Circle and District lines. We took the bus quite a few times as it is nice to be above ground to see the sights. Overall it was fine at the hotel. Clean and well kept. We were thankfully on a non smoking floor. We did have a great view of the London Eye. I would stay here again if the price was right."
251,828,"May 11 2007 	Great Location good hotel	The location of the hotel was great. It is about only about 2 bldgs away from the Gloucester Road Tube stop. That stop is on 3 lines so it is easy access to everything. There is a Tesco Express directly across from the tube stop that is open until 11pm. We could pick something up quick on the way home and keep it in our little refrigerator in the room. It is a nice way to combat the expense of London. The hotel was clean and comfortable, not upscale but had everything that you need. The room was small but not overly so. The only thing out of place was that the wallpaper didn't look like it was hung right. My big complaint was that they really tried to rip you off with phones and internet. $2.50/min back to the US. The last place we stayed in Europe only charged us $0.15/min. Otherwise, really great location with the refrige being key."
252,828,"May 7 2007 	Second stay at the Kensington Forum	This is our 2nd time at the Kensington Forum and love the location. We are priority club members so check in and check out is QUICK. The rooms are not huge but very clean and quiet, the view from our room was fabulous, and was very bright and cheerful.Always a busy hotel, American Airlines put their staff up here - always a good sign. Area is good, you can get a full english at Garfunkels just round the corner from the hotel for a fiver! Also if you walk towards Earls Court about 10minutes from hotel you will come across a high street with lots of good restaurants without the high prices. We ate at a really good Indian, very popular, good service plenty to eat for about 7 each. Always happy with the Forum, easy to get to the tube and plenty of places to eat at night -"
253,828,"May 5 2007 	VFM!!	Booked through lastminute.com as a 'top secret hotel' (156 2 people for 2 nights) - was advertised as a 4* but not sure about this to be honest.Location was great (come out of tube station, take first turn right and walk 150 yards &amp; you're there!!). Check in was within a minute as was check-out. Room wasn't luxurious but did exactly what we wanted in that it was clean and had a comfy bed!Didn't eat in hotel as was a great Asian restaurant (Dim T) 300 yards down Gloucester Rd and numerous places for breakfast nearby.Less than a 5 minute walk to Natural History Museum but the best part for us was that the Piccadilly, Circle &amp; District lines could all be accessed from Gloucester Rd tube."
254,828,May 5 2007 	Breakfast an added bonus!!!	Stayed here back in Nov 2006. Good a really good deal (for London prices) that was advertised in the Daily Mail on a Saturday. Was delighted when we checked in to discover that breakfast was included! A hot breakfast too - not just continental! Room was clean and bathroom was compact and modern. We had an empty fridge that other reviewers talked about so this was another bonus. We put our own drinks into it as London bar prices are quite steep. Location was great - close to tube stop. We were out sight seeing so much we didn't really have much cause to speak to the hotel staff apart from checking in and checking out and on these occasions the staff were courteous and helpful.
255,828,"May 2 2007 	No problems at all!	After reading the previous posts I wasnt sure what to expect from the hotel.On arriving in the large lobby (complete with seats and a cafe), I was already impressed, it was spacious and clean. The consierge were helpful, polite and never snobby.The room itself was very clean, the bathroom was small but immaculate. The views from the window (I was on the 15th floor) were great. The bed and linen supplied were faultless. Breakfast was served for a good period of time, and almost everything you'd want for breakfast was available.The location of the hotel was excellent, a 5 min stroll from Gloucester Road tube, next to tesco express and a large supermarket just around the corner. The luggage facility was superb too, we had no problems in checking out of the room and leaving our luggage which was securely labelled and organised, for no extra cost.I have no complaints at all! I would most definatley go back!"
256,828,"Apr 23 2007 	perfect for a weekend in london	The web site has very good deals so, for us, it wasnt expensive, considering the london prices. The room and the bathroom were very clean. The stuff was very helpfull, giving us very important tips about London (it was our first time in London). The location is perfect, very central and very near the subway.The weekend was perfect and we couldnt have choose a better place to stay."
257,828,"Apr 23 2007 	better than expected but still wouldn't return	We've stayed at the Holiday Inn for 3 days (bussiness). When we were told we would stay there we where a bit disappointed. However the location was great with the underground and good restaurants (Indian and Spanish) nearby.The rooms are decent. No luxury inside, but better than expected. Although I must admit we had very low expectations. Checking out was a horror. It took over 15 minutes!Breakfast was ok. Nothing special. Next time we would go to another hotel in the same area."
258,828,"Apr 21 2007 	Basic clean lodging service lacking.	We stayed here as part of a hotel/airfare package, so it is difficult to say how much we paid per night. We booked the room as a triple, and were pleasantly surprised to find three single beds, rather than a double and a sofa bed. To give you an idea of size, three singles fit in the room with about 2' of space between each bed. We had enough room to walk across the room at the feet of the beds, but not much more.We were supposed to have a refrigerator, but found it missing when we arrived. We called twice to get one, with no luck. Same deal with a hairdryer. Same deal with a bathtub mat. The room was generally clean.The bathroom was adequate, and was cleaned each day. Plenty of towels each day, and we only had a problem with no hot water one morning out of seven.There is a small utility room on the top floor with some vending machines. While we were there, the vending machine was broken for at least three days, but there was always plenty of ice in the ice machine.Continental breakfast was included, and was quite good. Three choices of dry cereal, honeydew and watermelon, pastries, lunchmeats, and several kinds of juice. There is also a full breakfast which seemed outrageously priced at 14.95 Pounds. It had eggs, hashbrowns, and some breakfast meats, but certainly did not seem worth the expense.There is a restaurant in the lobby and an exercise room on the first floor, neither of which we used.One of the nicest features about this hotel is the location. It is about two blocks from the Underground, which saved us a TON of time and money. Do not underestimate this feature, especially after a long day of sight-seeing.If you are looking for a 5-star hotel, look elsewhere. If you are looking to keep dry and clean overnight, consider the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum."
259,828,"Apr 20 2007 	As Big As Bad	As a regular user of IHG I can simply say this hotel should not be called Holiday Inn.Nothing really bad happened during my stay, but nothing good happened neither and that is the problem.So many employees, a wonderful location, an impressive building. And the guest experience?... Dull...No priority club recognition a part of the Carpet on the floor that says PC, no approach from the porters. The concierge as any other in London had more knowledge than &quot;WIKIPEDIA&quot; but NO SMILE!, not even a greeting from the staff and even management walking pass (a scalfolding colapsed on the they of my arrival and the managers where everywhere)As a PC member you get to know the &quot;standards&quot; of this hotels, and honestly the receptionist, even she a was nice young lady, didn't hit ONE of them.The room was OK-ish, Great view as any other building with 20+ floors!, but nothing else. Instead of Mini Bar my room had just the hole where it normally is placed and some hanging cables... A very small and old TV and the bathroom door badly scratched as the room walls; and a first time experience: Sliding toilet door with no lock (not missing hey!, simply it never had one).On departure, everything charged on the credit card without showing the bill to check first... what happened then a Lunch I never had was charged to me. When the receptionist was told he looked at me like I was trying my luck. Then it was corrected and taken off my bill, but not before I felt like a thieve after he said he &quot;had to investigate before waving the charge&quot;?????Obviously it was their mistake but, no apologies...Well, after all, as I said, great location, great view, NOTHING ELSE!!!!No big problems, NO BIG HOSPITALITY!!!Small issues that just shouldn't have happened...Just Another Forgetable Stay, What A Pitty Missing All That Potential... I Bet The Bottom Line Is More Important...."
260,828,"Apr 18 2007 	Better options available	I stayed at Holiday Inn, Kensington Forum for 3 nights for business and was very disappointed. The room cost GBP245 per night (through company travel department) and the room was very basic, small tv, too soft mattress ie. very basic. My door card didn't work on two occassions which wouldn't be a big problem however on average the wait for the lift was always at least ten minutes (I was on the third floor and was told using the stairs wasn't an option). The breakfast room reminded me of a school canteen - despite the breakfast being part of the room rate after the first day I went to a local cafe instead. (The queues were also very long) The internet service which costs GBP15 per day is slower than dial-up ! The hotel also seemed very understaffed and after 15 minutes in the check out queue (which was only half staffed) I gave up and called and checked out over the phone later. On a positive note the location is great and the overworked staff did their best however if visiting London their are definitely better options such as the NH which is just around the corner."
261,828,"Apr 10 2007 	Excellent Hotel will stay here again!	This was our second trip to London and let me just say from here on out, our hotel will always be the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum. Perfect location, right around the corner from the tube. The area is really safe with great food, boots, tesco, waitrose (large grocery chain) burger king, kfc and starbucks. Plus, really close to some of Londons finest pubs. If you've never been to Europe before the rooms may seem small but honestly they aren't. We had a chair, desk and a table in our room. Plus, the bathroom is a good size. There were 6 of us ( we took our parents) who stayed here and we all really enjoyed the hotel. Our parents who are 55-70 were able to wonder around the entire city by themselves due to the ideal location of this hotel. That was a big plus for us! Give this hotel a try, I'd be surprised if you are disappointed!"
262,828,"Apr 10 2007 	Another great stay!	This was our second stay at this hotel. Nothing had changed from the previous year. The rooms are very clean and come with a mini fridge that is empty and can be filled upon request.We used Priceline this time and were glad to get this hotel. For $80/nt. in central London it can't be beat.The hotel has a restaurant, breakfast room and a pub. Plus concierge services.We most like the proximity to the Gloucester Rd. tube stop and grocery stores which are a block away.The staff are very friendly and accomodating, they even held our luggage for two days as we were returning after a trip to Venice.I would definitely stay here again."
263,828,"Apr 8 2007 	Good room poor service all round	Stayed for 6 nights from March 22-28, 2007. The room was good and functional. Nothing fancy but we were quite happy with the location of the hotel, just like most who have stayed at the hotel before.But those who put an emphasis on service quality should avoid this hotel. Save for one particular manager at the check-in (a saving grace perhaps?), the rest were poor. This manager, Mr Zaweeq (not too sure about the spelling), helped me change my room to a higher floor and ensured that my luggages were moved. The rude and poor service started from the concierge who was curt when I asked a question. Then there're this man named Christian at the check-in who was very rude when attending to my wife when we had to activate our room key after 2nd night despite the fact that we're staying there for 6 nights! There was also this other man, Godfrey at the check-in who was also rude when I told him that I wanted to get my new room. He said, &quot; why did you want to change room? No changing room allowed!&quot; What utter rubbish. People asked to be changed rooms all the time and this was not my first time staying in hotels. On first day, when we were too early to check in, we left our luggage at the left luggage. The attendant who collected the luggage was very nice and helpful. When we were collecting our luggage, another attendant simply asked me to get our own bags instead of helping us collect. This attendant walked with a limp. Our room came with continental breakfast. Not much variety but good enough to start the day. The service at the breakfast room was ok. Overall, we found the hotel only good for location and decent room if somewhat cold just like the weather was in London then."
264,828,"Mar 31 2007 	GREAT HOTEL GREAT LOCATION	This was our second stay at this hotel and it was every bit as great as the first time. The room was very clean and was quite big for a London hotel room. The breakfasts were excellent and the location is great for viewing London by bus, on foot and by tube (Gloucester Road), which is just at the end of the road. There is also a Tesco Express, Burger King and KFC right at the end of the road. Turn right and there's a fish and chip shop and two steak houses. The only down side was the same as last time, very impersonal service by the Management and the on-duty Manager was just pure rude, but if you don't have to talk to any staff members, this hotel is great."
265,828,"Mar 28 2007	Great Location-Very Clean Miami FL	This hotel was a great bargin through priceline, and we were not treated as though we had booked through a discounter. We booked this hotel at the rate of $91.00 per night. The entire bill for our six night stay was 282 Pounds Sterling. The location in the Kensington area could not have been better, the area is safe, nice and fairly quiet. There is a tube station just down the street, which was wonderful. The concierges were all helpful and friendly, as a matter of fact, they suggested booking Hotel Link for our return to Gatwick which was quick, easy and quite inexpensive compared to the taxi ride we took on arrival.Additionally, they recommended the Cafe Forum which was about two blocks from the hotel for breakfast, the prices were reasonable and food was excellent. The Hereford Arms was highly recommended and was also excellent.During our stay, we found the people everywhere in London, friendly, helpful and truly pleasant. While the reviews are correct that the rooms are tiny, the cleanliness and nice bathrooms are a plus. The beds were comfortable, and the housekeeping staff also delivered feather pillows at my request.Our beds were changed daily and the room immaculate upon our return each evening. The TV worked, although I must say that the channel selection was limited.We used a phone card to reach the US, and the hotel charges 1 pound for access, but it was still fairly cheap.Make sure you stop by the London visitors center for maps, etc."
266,828,"Mar 27 2007 	Love It At The Forum.	This Was My Fourth Stay At The Kensington Forum.To Be Honest, It Will Always Be My First Choice Hotel When I Visit London.The Rooms Have Always Been Clean And Quiet And A View Over London To Die For. The Breakfast Is Also First Class.A Great Location, Friendly And Polite Staff, First Class Breakfast And Rooms As Described Above Will Have Me Returning Again And Again."
267,828,"Mar 24 2007	Priceline a great bargain	We got this for $80 a night plus taxes. In overpriced London it was a great deal. The room was clean and , by London standards, decently sized. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. it is right by the tube."
268,828,"Mar 23 2007	Excellent Value	Don't expect glamor or luxury but the beds are comfy, the bathrooms clean and plenty of hot water for such a large hotel. Also, we were able to check in at 8:00 am. A BIG plus after travelling all night. Skip the breakfast option as it's a ripoff. You'll wait in line an hour every morning. There are a couple of great coffee and pastry places around the corner (Particularly Paul-the other place has disgusting coffee). The location can't be beat. The Gloucester tube stop just around the corner will take you virtually everywhere. Get an Oyster card for the week to save on tube fares."
269,828,"Mar 23 2007 	Beware of fans and generators	Stayed in room 516 right at the end of the corridor was next to a services room from which there was a constant generator / fan noise. This noise could be heard inside the room and was irritating - the television had to be turned up to be heard and so on. Otherwise the room was fine for one, but was rather compact and would have been too cramped for two people. No other problems - the room was clean, the bed was comfortable and everything in the room worked. Curiously the mini-bar was not stocked, but a small bottle of wine appeared in the room after I initially checked in - possibly something to do with my Priority Club membership - a nice touch. Very convenient location for Gloucester Road tube. Breakfast was good, although the cooked breakfast is ordered from the waiter rather then being a buffet - unusual in Holiday Inns. Without the fan noise the hotel was have been excellent."
270,828,"Mar 18 2007 	no problems at the forum	I booked this hotel thru Priceline.co.uk because I prefer to stay in this area of London, this hotel is very big and tall (my room was at 14 floor) and a bit unpersonal but all that I can say is that is very clean and safe.Around Gloucester tube there are so many bars, restaurants and shops that you could choose one different every lunch or dinner.Do not eat breakfast at HI because 16 is too expensive and you can eat at Paul for half price"
271,828,"Mar 13 2007 	Comfortable Hotel	A weekend break in London to take in a show and some culture led the two of us to the HI Forum, South Kensington.Weekday users may be deterred from using this hotel since the enlargement of the congestion zone but as it doesn't apply on the weekend that wasn't a concern for us. We drove in and despite the warnings that parking spaces are taken quickly on our travel agent supplied paperwork, (hotel was part of a theatre deal) we found a deserted underground garage and a steep set of stairs (from the garage up to ground level) which would probably defeat guests with prams, kids and luggage, up to the entrance of the hotel.A uniformed greeter was very welcoming and pointed us in the right direction to check in. It was noticeable that flight crews used the hotel with several groups checking in at the same time - coupled with too few staff on the desk and it became a drag although we were in our room within 40mins of arriving.The room was a typical Holiday Inn effort but I have to commend the cleanliness - nothing broken, damaged or grimey and the bathroom smelt fresh. Small, with soft beds the room served well for the night we stayed and the card controlled lift access was a nice feature which made the hotel feel more secure.In room features were, a/c, TV (good channel mix and films) phone, iron and board, hair dryer, tea, coffee, hot choc &amp; kettle, In-room fridge (ring down for mini bar service), shower over bath and wall mounted shower gel dispensers (no other toiletries but a card offering to provide anything you may have forgotten)The hotel had a shop, cash machine, and gym onsite. Didnt use the gym but the shop was charging standard London prices for items. The hotel was let down by the quality of its breakfast. UK chain hotels rarely get this right and the HI Forum was no exception. Whilst on the surface there is evidence of choice, everything felt a little tired, limp or left under the hot lamps for too long. Perhaps weekdays are better, but next time we would get up a little earlier and eat out locally.The location was excellent with a number of good eating options locally and Garfunkels and Ask Pizza located in a complex within a very short walking distance for kids (or gorwn ups) who want something easy. Within the same complex is a Boots and Waitrose so filling the provided in-room fridge with snacks is a doddle.Around the corner from this complex is a tube stop giving you access to anywhere you need in London and if going out locally in Kensington or its surrounding areas there were always black cabs pulled up in the taxi bay outside the hotel.The Nat History Museum and V&amp;A are in easy walking distance from the hotel and there are good crossing places to reach these museums. We passed a number of banks on the way up and also a large post office offering currency etc which should give better rates than the hotels in-house money changing service.All in all a clean hotel offering the standard you would expect of a well run chain but the breakfast really could do with an overhaul."
272,828,"Mar 10 2007 	unacceptable cleanliness	paid 140 including VAT for one night, staying on 12th floor overlooking the city, nice view.Location: brilliant, behind tube station, near local stores, restaurant, posh area, near kensington park, great central location yet quiet enough in a cul-de-sac location. flaw location of main entrance, big signs and big flags on main street but enter from the back, tiny miserable unwelcoming cheap entrance design, confusing to first time visitors.check in: need to wait at least until 14:00 to get a room, need to fill in a form, be careful when order newspapers, they charge you except priority club member, this is not mentioned anywhere on the form, and unacceptable considered it is normally included in many other four stars hotels, paid 140 per night and they asked for another 65 pence for newspapers, cheapskate!luggage storage: freely available with super friendly staffs, may leave bags there and get on with the trip rather than waiting for hours to check in. also may use the facilities after check out before leaving the city. safe and reliable.room: good size considered it is in london, comfy double bed, clean in room, tea/coffee/choc making facilities, hairdryer under desk, old tv, toilet facilities was disgusting, long curly black hair in bathtub, big black pubic hair tangled in hand towel, disgusting yellow scum stick on toilet seat, dove shampoo bottle near bathtub and dove cream cleanser bottle near hand basic were both empty, cheap plastic canteen cups on wash basin, only one tiny hand soap, NO supply of essential basic vanity kits (shower cap, razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, sewing kits, shoes polish, etc) only available if ask, cheap standard chain hotel decor, room was quiet, did not hear anything from the street, but doors closed loudly from nearby rooms on the corridor.toilets on 1st floor near gym: look like a public toilet in supermarket/ mall, cheap cheap cheap.services: no housekeeper answered calls when tried many times after 10pm, called again early in morning and waited for more than 30 minutes for shampoo to arrive. even arranging morning call needs to wait exceptionally long to have anyone to answer the phone.breakfast: 06:00 - 10:00, good quality food, lots of choice, continental, full english, hot and fresh, very friendly staffs.check out: fast and smooth, polite staff.the only reason to choose this hotel is its location, for other aspects, not up to standard for its price."
273,828,"Mar 8 2007 	Functional Value	We stayed in the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for 4 nights in March 2007. We booked through Priceline at a very reduced rate. From that perspective, the hotel provided a comfortable, efficient home base for us. We arrived from the USA in the early morning, and had to wait for a room to be available. There is a check room to leave your luggage so that you can go exploring while you wait. We returned to the hotel at the time we had been told, and were told to wait again. After 3 more visits to the desk, we received a room. One man was quite rude and unhelpful during this process; one lady was particularly kind so that evened out. Once we had access to our room on the 14th floor, we were pleasantly surprised. It was in my opinion large for London (home of notoriously small hotel rooms) but had a few English quirks. To operate the lights, you must insert your room key into a holder near the door. I finally located the hair dryer under the desk on the last morning of our stay. The bed was very comfortable and having a fridge was an added bonus. The room and bath were very clean. There is 24 hour room service, a restaurant, and a tavern in the hotel although we did not sample the hotel food. There is a business center with email capabilities for 2 pounds/30minutes, open on weekdays only. The best part about this hotel was the close proximity to Gloucester Road tube stop (Picadilly, District, and Circle lines) and the Paul bakery across the street from the tube stop - home of the best hot chocolate ever. In sum, we wouldn't pay rack rate for this hotel, but at a reduced price it's an efficient, functional place to stay in London."
274,828,Mar 5 2007 	Overall very good	Check in was quick and easy. There were at least 6 staff checking people in so no delays. The room was very clean and tidy although a little small. Ok for me on my own though. Bathroom very clean. In-house movies were expensive as were the drinks in the bar (not unexpected though as in London). The staff were very pleasant and helpfull and the hotel is very well siruated within a minutes walk from the tube. My only suggestion is finding out if there are many coach parties. On one day I stayed there was quite a delay for breakfast as two parties descended on them at the same time. The cooked breakfast was very well prepared and although it was buffet style was very hot on each occassion I went. Many hotels I have stayed in the food has been rarely hot.
275,828,"Mar 4 2007	It's What I Expected	This stay at the Holiday Inn was chosen based on other reviews on this site. I found the hotel to be clean, quiet, and comfortable. I would not pay rack rate for a room here, but it is quite attractive at a discounted price. The bed was very comfortable, and the empty refrigerator was a great place to store food and beverages. Although my room was only on the fourth floor, the noise-proofing was quite impressive, and I could barely hear street noise from Cromwell Road. The elevators are very fast, and the entire hotel had a clean, upkept feel about it. It is not luxurious, but it certainly is a good value in London."
276,828,"Mar 4 2007 	Good hotel close to everything	Stayed at the Holiday Inn Forum for one night. I paid GBP 108.00 which is an affordable price for a hotel in the posh area of Kensington. The Forum Holiday is a big high rise and right across the street, is another Holiday Inn, albeit it much smaller which tends to confuse people looking for that 2nd location hotel. When I arrived at the hotel, I had to park my rental car and beware parking is GBP 30,00 a night. Check in was quick and efficient. My room was small but it was clean and everything was okay except for the wireless internet which kept going in and out every 5 minutes. My colleague had the breakfast for GBP 10.95 and he found it nothing special. I went to the Starbucks one block away and had a very nice breakfast for less than what he paid. Subway (Underground station) is also a block away and you can be in downtown London within 15 minutes. Harrods is only a 25 minute walk. In all, as with many Holiday Inns hotels worldwide, affordable with good rooms and customer service but there is always one or two issues that keep this chain from being a affordable and good place to stay."
277,828,Mar 3 2007 	ideal location	Good functional hotel. Situation is great for the tube and some major museums. We had a great 30 minute walk through a lovely peaceful area of London to Stamford bridge football ground. The hotel has reasonable facilities on the doorstep but you have a wider choice by traveling one stop on the tube to High Street Kensington. The rooms were good although one did have a smell of smoking to it despite being on a no smoking floor. Staff were very helpful and the hotel bar is very pleasant. Overall a great situation in London. If you get a higher floor there are fantastic views. Within easy reach you have all you could want peaceful areas and shops and food outlets.
278,828,"Feb 28 2007	Great Hotel	We stayed here in September 2006 and found the hotel to be a perfect base in an ideal neighborhood from which to explore London. Our westward facing room was on the 17th floor, and we saw a couple of beautiful sunsets out the windows, sharing wine and cheese that wed purchased at the Waitrose supermarket a block away on Gloucester Rd or at the Sainsbury supermarket two blocks down Cromwell Rd. As others have mentioned, the room is small, a bit bigger than a room on a cruise ship, but its immaculate, has a small refrigerator, and has a well appointed bathroom with vanity and full tub and shower. The air conditioning worked flawlessly, and we used it every day. Also, if you want to heat up something you bought at the store or brought back from a restaurant, there's a snack room with a microwave on the 25th floor.Theres also a decent fitness center on the 1st floor and internet access in the business center on the ground floor. However, heres a good internet caf one block away on Cromwell Rd. thats far less expensive. We had a drink in the lobby bar once, but two mediocre glasses of wine cost us 13 GBP (Turning Leaf cabernet --- I saw a bottle at Sainsbury for half the price), so we didnt return. The neighborhood is upscale and beautiful, and theres convenient access to the Tube at the Gloucester Rd stop a block away from the hotel. Theres an outstanding steakhouse called Black and Blue a block away on Gloucester Rd, and the patisserie Paul, where one can get a decent croissant and hot chocolate for breakfast, is across from the Tube stop on Gloucester Rd. For late night snacking theres a Tesco 24 hour market on Gloucester Rd. between Paul and Black and Blue. We found good restaurants for dinner near Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and in South Kensington, all very close to the Tube. A tip on getting to the hotel from the Tube stop ---- its only a one block walk up Courtfield Gardens Rd. If you happen to go up Cromwell Rd., turn left on Ashburn Place and walk one block. The entrance to the hotel parking lot is on your right just before you reach Courtfield Gardens Rd.At an average cost of 104 GBP per night, we didnt get nearly as good a deal as several reviewers on this site were able to get, but for the total quality of our experience, we feel that we received decent value. We will definitely return to this hotel on subsequent trips to London, but will look for better deals next time."
279,828,Feb 25 2007 	Your average stay	The room and bathroom were clean. The hotel is average at best. I found the staff to be unfriendly.
280,828,"Feb 24 2007 	Outstanding value in an expensive town	Stayed in this hotel for 6 nights, during which my wife and I explored central London extensively. Hotel was clean, convenient to tubes, internet cafes, and local dining of all price ranges and styles. As other reviewers have remarked, our room was small, and designed for only the purposes of bathing, watching TV, and sleeping. The fridge has been converted from the previous infamous honor bar (which used to charge for any item moved) to a BYO refreshments, suitable for storing a few cups of yogurt and sodas. The hairdryer which other reviewers couldn't find was located under the bedroom countertop, not in the bathroom. A nice touch was the availability of power plugs for USA 110 volts, Euro 220, as well as UK 220 appliances.All in all, this hotel was an excellent value ($75/night on Hotwire), perfect for us who needed it only as a place to clean up and sleep. If you're looking for authentic English charm, go elsewhere. For well-maintained, practical accomodations, I highly recommend it."
281,828,"Feb 22 2007 	It's a 2 star business place at best.	After a long journey, I was looking forward to the allegedly four-star accomodations at this Kensington area hotel. Unfortunately, when I arrived, I found it to be a 2 star at best, at least comparable to 4 stars Stateside. I've stayed at 3-star boutiques in major US cities far superior to this place. It was clean enough, but lacking in very basic ways.The TV was a tiny desktop model. The fridge was self-service (you had to call room service to have it stocked if you wanted anything) and barely functional, so didn't chill the sodas I bought. The only ice machine was on the 25th floor--and didn't actually contain buckets for transporting the ice back to your room. In the sliding-door bathroom, there was no hair dryer, common amenities like shower caps, shampoo, etc. were absent, the &quot;luxury&quot; body product available was Dove liquid soap (a budget drugstore line at best). Like I said, it was clean, though a bit shabby. Overall, not the worst, but certainly not a 4 star. If I had been able to read these reviews first, I'd certainly have saved myself about $60 per night and stayed in a hostel, instead!"
282,828,"Feb 21 2007	Great Location and Hotel for the Money	After relentlessly searching out many smaller hotels and BB in London with lousy reputations and higher prices, we ended up booking a room for 3 adults thru Hotwire for $119 per nite for 6 nites, Feb.7-12. The location in South Kensington is excellent as the Gloucester Road tube station is just around the corner and is served by 3 main lines--District, Circle and Piccadilly. Very easy to get to any part of the city quickly. The hotel is a 27 floor high rise but since we were only on the 7th floor, we really didn't get the spectacular view I had hoped for. But on the flip side, we couldn't complain, because when we arrived at 10:30am our first day in town, we were actually able to check right into our room instead of just leaving our bags to go and sight see. A wonderful unexpected surprise and excellent start to our first day in town. The front desk and concierge were all very helpful and knowledgeable. The bathroom in our room was immaculately clean. There is an empty refridgerator in the room for snacks, a 110 plug at the desk--handy for Americans and also a blowdryer, iron/ironing board provided. About the only negative thing I can say about the room, was that when the sofa/chair was pulled out into the single bed for the third adult, there was absolutely only about 4 inches between the end of the bed and the desk in order to pass to go to the bathroom. The immediate area around the hotel is extremely well serviced by at least 3 internet cafes, grocery store next to tube station, as well as several nice cafes and restaurants. ASK is a very nice Italian restaurant nearby serving pastas and pizzas with excellent service which will run about 10+ GBP per person. The Patisserie and Garfunkle's are also other cafes with well rounded menus nearby. Also, a wonderful pastry shop (can't remember the name?) for light breakfast across the street from the tube station--excellent for breads, pastries, hot chocolate, coffee. Starbucks, KFC and Burger King also right there across from the tube although we did not eat there. I can't comment on any of the hotel restaurants or food as we never ate there with so many other choices nearby. Can't say enough about the price, quality, location and convenience of this hotel and area. This hotel was just excellent for us and we would definitely recommend it and stay here again."
283,828,"Feb 17 2007	Fab Location	Just returned from 2 nights stay with my 2 teenaged girls. Good points excellent location really very close to the tube and the tube is on good lines so not lots of changing. Also got a good price for the room thro priceline about 47 pounds per night, hotel very clean and well run. The bad points the rooms are really small especially if like us you are 3 to a room. I asked if we could have anything bigger but was told no!All in all I would recommend and would stay again if the price was right!"
284,828,"Feb 15 2007 	Typical Holiday Inn	Myself and two friends booked a 2 night stay at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum while taking a tour of England and Wales. The location is in a good location near the tube and only a few minutes by cab to central London (about 12 pounds). We had an overnight flight from the US and arrived at Gatwick at 0830 and at the Hotel at around 1030. Despite having traveled all night we were assigned a room and given room keys, but the room had not been cleaned. I had prepaid for the room on Hotwire (good price at $120.00 US dollars per night) and previously requested a room with 3 beds as we are 3 males who wanted our own beds and I was prepared to pay for the upgrade. I was advised the charge would be a total of 60 pounds but they tried to charge me 120 pounds upon checkout.Although smaller rooms are expected in Europe, the room with 3 beds in this hotel is considerably smaller than most standard size US hotel rooms. So much so that the beds were practically side by side and there was zero room to move. My advice Do NOT get a room with 3 beds if you are 3 adults travelling together. It was impossibly too small. Avoid the food in the hotel restaurant as it is ridiculously overpriced. Visit a small place just down the street where cabbies eat. Also there is a nice bistro around the corner with very good food that is moderately priced. The hotel staff was cold and indifferent- not impressed at all.Overall, this hotel is typically what you would expect for Holiday Inn. If you are just looking for basic lodging at a good price in London- this is the place. If you are looking for a bit more comfort and better service, look elsewhere."
285,828,"Feb 11 2007	Good choice for our trip	My 10 year old son and I just returned from a week's stay at this hotel. Although in some ways I would have preferred a smaller, more authentic English hotel, we really couldn't beat the combination of price and location (booked on priceline for $79/night). When we arrived at about 10:00 A.M, there was a non-smoking room available for us on the 7th floor. A higher floor would have been nice for the view, but we were so eager to check in, freshen up, and start exploring that we readily took the available room. Our room had two twin beds and a small pull-out sofa. The room and the bathroom were very clean and quite adequate. The water pressure and water temperature in the bathtub were great (I'm a bath junkie). Housekeeping did a nice job each day and it was pleasant to return to an immaculate, restocked room each day.My 10-year old really liked the energy saving feature that requires a key card to be left in a slot near the door so that the lights will stay on. When you leave and take your key card with you, the lights automatically shut off after a few minutes. We used the mini refrig to keep drinks and snacks, and enjoyed the coffee and hot chocolate provided. At check-in I was offered a pre-pay breakfast buffet for about 11 pounds a day. Ordinarily I would have passed, but my son was able to eat for free with a paying adult, so I bought it. He ended up only eating cereal each day any way because he did not care for the english breakfast and only a few items from the continental breakfast. Next time I will purchase cereal, milk, and plastic bowls @ the nearby grocery store and save some money. Information on the hotel's website and the tv information channel suggests that internet access is available for purchase in all rooms. It was not available in our room and was very expensive (6 pounds/90 minutes) to use in the lobby area. I really would have liked to have been able to check e-mail and upload photos in my pajamas in my room.The walk to the Gloucester Rd tube station was quick and easy. Just remember to take a right when you exit the station. If you go left, you end up on the side of the hotel with no entrance and you have to walk all the way around. I would definitely stay at this hotel again in the future."
286,828,"Feb 8 2007 	Two day break!	After reading the reveiws on this hotel i had no doubts about staying there. The place was fantastic, it has 27 floors, we only stayed on teh 4th but it was quiet, clean and only a short walk from the hotel bar. We did ask for a high room but that was ignored i think!The food here is great, we had breakfast brought to our room, although pricy well worth it. Although we did get a strange phone call from room service at 1am, wrong number i think...The hotel is a 1 minute walk from Gloucester Road tube station which is on district, circle and picadilly lines, excellent for seeing London, (use an oyster card, see there web site)....This hotel is great i am going to use again and again....Thank you holiday inn..."
287,828,"Feb 3 2007 	Well-located and good service	We've stayed here before, and it's surprisingly well located, just behind Gloucester Road tube. In spite of its size, we found the service to be good - speedy check-in, and very rapid response to a broken toilet at 11pm. It may be rather anonymous due to its enormous size, but it's clean, well-maintained and helpful in our view."
288,828,"Jan 26 2007 	Nice hotel for the price	Stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum from 1/17/07-1/22/07. Was a last minute trip visiting London, with cheap last minute fare. Bid last minute priceline rate of $80/night X 5 nights approximately 6 days prior to travel.Came in into Hearthrow in a redeye, so arrived at the hotel around 10:20AM. Was told I had a confirmed prepaid room via priceline, but no rooms were available. Asked to be booked into nonsmoking double room highest level possible. Was told to check in after 2PM. Went sightseeting with the tube, came back around 3PM. Got a 19th floor room facing east (toward Harrods) with a double bed as requested.The room was small, but clean. Excellent for Europe standards. Everything was in good working shape. Nothing to say that this room was a &quot;priceline&quot; room. The room had a smallish 15? TV (hate the blinking of PAL 24FPS tv). Also had a working small (and quiet) fridge, which came in very handy. The bed was decent, and not run down. Sheets were clean. Bathroom was clean.Housekeeping was good. They never woke me up (although I did have the TV loud in the mornings so...) The room was kept clean, and restocked with cups, teas, etc as they were used. There was no minibar, so no extraneous charges.Location is good if you plan on taking the tube. Walking distance (5-10 minutes) from the V+A museum. 1 block from tube station (Gloucester). Direct line from Heathrow airport via Picadilly tube line (4 pounds one way, ~6.5 pounds for zone 1-6 offpeak 1 day travelard). I wouldn't bother taking Heathrow express, because you will then have to take another tube or taxi to go backwards to the hotel, and besides its cheaper on straight tube stop from heathrow. The Big Bus tour stops 1 block away (did not use). 2 tube stop away from Harrods and shopping (Picadilly line). 1 block away from many restaurants, and a Tesco express for supplies (very handy). Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc.Would not recommend the Patisserie (food looked overpriced, pastries were dry!!). If you want a danish or croissant, get it from &quot;Paul's&quot; next door. Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course. If you're from the US, think 2-3X the average price when you convert to US dollars.Would recommend the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for location, price (via priceline), and cleanliness."
289,828,"Jan 22 2007 	Decent rooms and good location	Stayed at this hotel, for one night, as the location was ideal for our night out at the Royal Albert Hall (25 odd mins walking distance away or 5 taxi fare).Like previous reviewers, I found this hotel to be, as I would expect any Holiday Inn to be. Clean, well maintained, fixtures and fittings in good condition and generally a pleasant enough room. A bit on the small side but you only notice this when two of you are trying to get ready in a rush and you can get past each other!Booked from the hotels own website and paid 74 for the night (no breakfast, VAT inclusive). At this price, I got what I expected, if I had paid any more, I would have been disappointed.As also said before, location is excellent, very near the tube stations, plenty of delis and eating places nearby and a supermarkets for any snacks we wanted for the room.We did have some issues with check in and check out. Although we had email confirmation that the room was prepaid, the check in staff insisted that the back office didnt actually take payment and wanted us to pay again.Their systems also got confused as to what was actually booked (thought we had one room for 2 nights instead of 2 rooms for one night) and tried to take another payment from us!! After finally getting that sorted they confirmed that we could pay on check out.Fortunately, we later checked with our banks and they confirmed that the hotel had already take full payment. So on check out, not only did the staff try to take another payment, they tried to take it at normal room rates and not the discounted rate!!When that was all finally sorted out, they then had to sheepishly admit that the previous day, when swiping our credit card for room guarantees, they deducted 30 as deposit. Considering they didnt tell us at the time, I would consider this theft!!However, having spent a total of an hour between checking in and out, we just wanted to get going and just got the necessary assurances that out cards would only be deducted with the correct charges.Oh and a final gripe. Despite booking and getting agreement for a late check out, the check in staff couldnt be bothered to log that on the system and as a result the cleaning staff tried to boot us out earlier than they should have!!!Despite the incompetence of the check in staff, if I had to stay in the area again, I would make this hotel my first choice but ensure I didnt pay more than 80. Any more and I'd look for other alternatives."
290,828,"Jan 19 2007	10 good days	we took our two teens to London for 10 days over Christmas before they leave for college this fall. we had two rooms and the continental breakfast as part of a package through go-travel which we extended through the agent for the same room rate. we read this site extensively about the hotel and felt it would be resonable. it exceeded our expectations. our room, which was a handicap access room due to the crowded season, was actually a great choice, as the bath is large, light filled and with updated fixtures. both rooms were kept very clean during our extended visit.unlike some reviews, we had no trouble with staff, the concierge, or desk. there are quite a few tours and airline crews that stay here, so there are lines at the desk on occasion. a gift from a friend was tardy due to boxing day and the hotel provided a complimentary bottle of wine.We ate at 7:30 every morning and had no lines. the continental breakfast of cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit and ham and cheese was well maintained. london is very expensive to eat, so we made this one of two meals each day.the hotel is in an attractive very safe area and close to other hotels and a hostel. it is excellently positioned to take advantage of the tube, which we found the best way to get about town. that system is now set so that the oyster card is the least expensive way to travel, and the daily cap is less than the cost of the multi-day transit passes.there are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high- we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always! the local waitrose take away is also a good budget option if the weather is with you."
291,828,"Jan 19 2007 	Generally good with some minor exceptions	Stayed for 1 night in January on business. I pre-booked an &quot;executive&quot; room, which at 80 i thought sounded very good value. It proved good value for a regular room but the advertised extras to justify the &quot;executive &quot; tag were not all there. Complimentary water and chocolates were not provided and the room seemed no larger than a standard one.The kettle switched itself off well before the water had boiled and the shower head holder was broken so i was unable to adjust the direction of the spray very well.These are minor quibbles, but it's these things that make a difference when you have paid the extra for an &quot;executive&quot; room.My general view of the hotel is that it was modern, very clean and comfortable. The staff i came accross were all very cheerful and helpful.I ate in the Tavern Bar attached to the hotel. The Fish &amp; Chips i had was very good quality, although i thought 9 was a bit on the pricey side.I would certainly stay here again (it is a very convenient location) but i wouldn't bother being tempted by the &quot;executive&quot; rooms."
292,828,"Jan 15 2007	My current top london pick	I have stayed at alot of london hotels in the last few years and this one is the best value for money right now. usually can get for about 70 GBP per night VAT inclusive, on priceline or lastminute or some other website. The top-secret description of this one is easy to peg as it's one of the only high-rise hotels in the area.The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The decor is modern, bathrooms are very lean and nice, and the beds are very comfortable. Only once have they pushed a twin bed together to make a king, but they did apologize for it. The lobby looks dated and can be a bit impersonal, and the restaurant doesn't look like anything special. Usualy don't have breakfast here. There are some wonderful places to eat at just around the corner, including a very reasonable Thai place, ASK, a grocery store just arcross the street, just across the street from Gloucester Road tube station which gives you great access to the tube system. Location is great, hotel is wonderful, and price is right, it really is hard to beat right now."
293,828,"Jan 10 2007 	good location great deal on priceline	This hotel is in a very convenient location, just a block and a half from the Gloucester Road tube station. There are also many helpful bus lines within a two-block radius of the hotel. The neighborhood, full of many other hotels, has groceries stores, some pubs, and a Starbucks.Our room was neat and clean with no problems at all. We arrived at the hotel after a transatlantic flight at about 9:30am and they let us check in and have our room right away. There were not extras like sewing kits in the room; however, sewing kits, toothbrushes, etc were available from the concierge if you just ask.Our amazing deal from priceline did not include breakfast, but there were many places in the neighborhood to grab breakfast for a reasonable price before heading out for the day.Overall it was a good experience and we would certainly stay here again for a good rate."
294,828,"Jan 9 2007 	Worth Considering	One of the larger Holiday Inn hotels in London and therefore one with more frequent deals on offer. Comfortable room with large bed but limited space as is often the case with London hotels, but I found the location excellent. A very short walk to Gloucestor Road tube station (especially once you realise where the hotel's main entrance lies). From here good connections to the city via Piccadilly line or Circle line."
295,828,"Jan 8 2007 	Thanks to Tripadvisor exactly how we expected it to be	We booked this hotel after reading all the reviews on this website. We were travelling with our son aged 10, so we asked for a double room with extra bed. We informed the hotel we would be arriving very late at night which turned out to be round about haft past two. They gave us what they call a &quot;family room&quot;. The disappointment was that when we got to our room the extra bed was infact a sofa and it was not ready, which at that time of night was quite inconvenient. Once we opened the sofa-bed there was only the underneath sheet and a blanket and it occupied the whole room up to the desk which meant that to go to the toilet we had to clyme over our son's bed! The sofa bed is not made up and the third person is not considered as far as cups, glasses or towls unless you require extras with the personnel. The good side of this hotel is that it is clean, the people are helpfull, Consortia restaurant is very good even if quite expensive. The breakfast is very good and children can help themselves with English breakfast even if not included. Please remember that when they advertise that they have restaurants open till late it is not quite true, the latest is 10.00 pm."
296,828,"Dec 30 2006 	American overload	Stayed between Xmas and New Years and the room, location, etc were what to expect for the price I paid. What I didn't expect was that the hotel was choc-a-bloc with Americans. Do Holiday Inn stick them in this hotel on mass so as there is space in their other 30 hotels in London?There was a totally fake English pub where the bartenders expect tips, I mean they hand little silver trays out practically begging for tips. Obviously this is done to cater for the gullible Americans that were in the bar. The room was perfectly comfortable with great views, although I wish I was on a higher floor. The breakfasts were good value as long as you fill up for the day, lots on offer"
297,828,Dec 29 2006	Cleanest Hotel I've Ever Stayed In	We booked travel through Priceline on a Vacation Package special...the hotel was a GREAT DEAL at $77 US per night and was by far the cleanest hotel we've ever stayed in! The staff was very courteous and friendly and super accomodating. The bedroom was small (as are all rooms in Europe) but the bathroom was good sized and exceptionally clean. The location was great too as it was next to the tube. I would definately stay here again and would recommend it to anyone!
298,828,"Dec 18 2006 	Lovely Hotel Fantastic View	I have just come back from a weekend break at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum and I can highly recommend this hotel to those who like their hotels to have a clean fresh feel, a quiet stay and views that make tickets to the london eye surplus to requirements.I arrived at 12 o'clock, two hours earlier than the advertised check in, and had no problem checking in then. There was quite obviously a large choice of rooms available and the female check in receptionist managed to find me a non-smoking twin room with a view of london no problem (floor 16, room 1628, if anyone's interested and wants to quote a room number in order to get a view from the BT tower to your left across london (see the very accurate london skyline shots in the candid photos section) all the way over to what I assume to be Hammersmith. Interesting by day but dazzling by christmas time night. My friend and I barely watched the television in the room -that does indeed have 18 channels, four of which being foreing language - although why you would watch any them with the moving wallpaper out the window I have no idea.The previous reviews were accurate, regarding both the presence of airline crew (AA in this case) and the early-bird mentality of the cleaning staff. 8am on a sunday morning is a tad early to be ringing the room doorbell, though it is a large hotel and we had forgotten to put the 'do not disturb' sign out. To be fair, though, the cleaning staff were the only other people we heard from our room - a first for me when staying in a london hotel! The only tiny pedantic complaints I could possibly make are 1. that there didn't really seem to be a functioning air vent in our bathroom so it was a bit of a sauna after you used the shower, and 2. the sugar on the coffee making facilites seemed to have leaked over the teabags and one of the mugs, making them all a bit sticky - teeny tiny complaints in what otherwise is a faultless hotel, and I am sure with the later, had we complained they would have restocked us with teabags etc no question.For two girls staying in London, the security system meaning that only keycard holders can use the lift up to the guest floors was a welcomed one. Both the local area and the hotel felt safe, even at night. We did not have the breakfast, instead we ended up in The Patisserie, which I see others have recommended, which for London, let alone Kensington, is very good value. My friend and I had one pancakes and syrup, two orange juices, one tea, and one smoked salmon and scrambled egg with english muffin for 8 ($15 approx) in total - the same price as one discounted breakfast at the hotel! For incidental items there is a Tesco Metro and a Waitrose in gloucester road, about 100 metres from the hotel. (There is also a open top 'Big Bus Tour' stop on the same road if you feel like having a particularly touristy visit to the capital - if the Italian ticket seller is there, get chatting to him and be really friendly and he may give you the same discounts he gave us!)There is a starbucks on gloucester road but the hotel ground floor lounge cafe sells the starbucks range too and is open until at least 11pm. The waiting staff there are really friendly and the dutch (?) waiter who served us offered to completely remake my friend's coffee when she asked for water as it was too syrupy and strong, no question. So often I have booked a hotel at a price only to be disappointed with my choice on arrival. I was not disappointed by my choice at all this time, and can definitely see myself trying to get a bargain to stay here on future breaks up to London."
299,828,Dec 17 2006 	Great Hotel.	The Hotel is fantastic value for money. We booked on their own website. The deal stretched Friday 15 Dec til Sunday 17 Dec and included full breakfast and dinner on the first night. We had dinner on the first night with a voucher offered at reception. They had no 3 course dinner vouchers so gave us a 2 course with a free drink. both the breakfast and evening meals were fantastic. Only problem is that the resturant at breakfast gets very busy and we had to wait for a table. The wait was worth it....Although if not part of the deal then i would not pay the 17 pound for the breakfast. The location is great. Real handy for Heathrow and the City centre. London is magical at Christmas time and we had a top weekend. At check-out they cleared a small drinks bill as we were given the wrong voucher for Dinner..Nice touch i thought. Well recommended hotel.
300,828,"Dec 10 2006 	Excellent location but rooms far too hot	Booked for two nights through lastminute.com 'Mystery hotels' Reception staff freinedly and helpful, requested a quiet room and were given a room on the 17th floor facing the rear of the hotel which was about as quiet as you can expect for central london! Room was very very small! You can hardly walk round the beds without walking into other furniture. The bathroom was clean and modern with a sliding door (not enough room for a standard door as it would hit the wardrobe!) Our room had all of the facilities listed including fridge which came in handy. Our main complaint was the heat of the room. Even with the heater turned off it was like an oven. We had the window open for the whole time we were there but it made little difference. The hotel was ideally located in London with easy access to Gloucester road tube station. Don't pay the for the overpriced hotel breakfast. We tried the 'Patisserie' which was recommended by another tripadvisor member which was reasonably priced and on the way to the tube sation. There are a number of places to get breakfast near the hotel with more atmosphere and better value than the hotel. Overall a good experience but not sure the hotel deserves a 4* rating. There was nothing to set it apart from a good 3* hotel but would stay again if the price was right due to the excellent location."
301,828,"Dec 10 2006 	Good value in a good location	We have just returned from a week's stay at the Kensington Forum. Let me start with the positive. The location was ideal for getting around London. A few minutes walk to the Glouster Street tube station brought us to the Picadilly or Circle/District line where you could be at Harrods in a few minutes or switch to another line and be anywhere in the city in record time. The hotel is conveniently positioned near a couple of grocery markets, restaurants, pubs and musuems. The rooms were adequate and clean. Fresh linens were supplied, but don't expect extras like shower caps, sewing kits and shoe shine. The lobby was a bit bland, but did offer plenty of seating while waiting. The room could have been better lit as we did not have a view and were on a lower floor.As part of our package, the continental breakfast was included in the cost. More than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste. For additional cost you could have the full English breakfast. I believe the reception area offers discount coupons, but we were not asked. There is a fridge in the room but make sure it is plugged in. Ours was not and we did not notice until the next day when my purchased yogurt was still the same temperature. One of my pet peeves...lack of information. I asked a couple of questions regarding buses and directions to the desk staff and they seemed to be uninformed of the area. Not a huge problem, but I would assume if one was employed by a huge chain part of the training would be geography.That said, we could not check in until 2:00 and having arrived quite early in the morning, we needed somewhere to store the luggage. The storage room attendants were very nice and quite knowledgable. If you have any questions, I would recommend that you ask them. The hotel offers a laundry service which I needed to take advantage of. The bags were located in the closet, but no price list. Ask before you sending off your clothes. I had two pair of jeans washed for a total of 10 pounds. I could have bought a new pair of jeans for that price. However the service was quite efficient; my pants were brought back the same day.All in all it was just what we expected based on the price and would stay here again...knowing what we know now. A couple of things on my wish list would be higher floor with a view, better lighting in the room, and better informed staff."
302,828,"Dec 5 2006 	Don't turn the a/c off in a warm autumn	Booked through Lastminute.com's Mystery Hotel offer like a previous reviewer and paid 321 for 4 nights which is pretty good in this part of London.Hotel is clean, modern and well-run, and my partially-sighted wife really appreciated the lovely bright lights in all fittings. Room was very modern and clean, too, and everything worked bar the kettle which was replaced with a brand new one in 15 minutes.There are also rooms adapted for people with disabilities which we did not check out but wife (a carer) approved of their description in the hotel bumpf.We had a few problems - not told of the 9.95 breakfast vouchers sold at reception (16.90 otherwise if you pay in The Forum room on the first floor) until we'd been there a day or two; slightly patchy face cloth supply, the one time no-one in maintenance or reception would answer the phone, and the biggie - despite the warmest London autumn on record, the a/c was switched off (worked only as a heater) and the room was always too hot. You can at least open the window but the noise from Gloucester and Cromwell Roads is very loud.Which leads us to - location, this hotel's best feature. It's just a few hundred metres to the Gloucester Road Tube (metro) served by District and Piccadilly lines; the latter goes direct to Knightsbridge, Harrods, Piccadilly (shops, Fornum and Mason, The Ritz, The Wolsley, etc.) and on to Leicester Square (movies and theatre). Many good London museums are an easy walk away along Cromwell Road.The hotel has a passable till-11pm brasserie (not sampled as closed to breakfasters when we approached it just after 10am; The Forum is open till 10.30am) and adjacent tavern (not sampled as British no-smoking inside public spaces laws don't kick in until 1 July 2007) and there are excellent eateries nearby (in both Millennium hotels plus check out Garfunkels and Ask Pizza/Pasta in the adjacent Waitrose mall as well as others down the Gloucester Road) plus a 24-hour Tesco supermarket, a Waitrose supermarket, KFC, Burger King and so on."
303,828,"Dec 2 2006	Stay here - you won't regret it- great price - great location	I booked a double room on Lastminute by using their secret hotel booking system. I paid 144 for two nights in late November excluding breakfast. (Would definitely use secret hotel again by the way).I can't say anything bad about our stay at this hotel. Arrived quite late in the day so check-in was extremely quick and the member of staff who dealt with us was polite, friendly and efficient. We were given a standard double room on the 27th floor which is the top floor. The views were spectacular, we could see loads of Londons landmarks including Harrods - all beautifully lit up for Christmas.The room itself was everything you would expect for a 4 star chain hotel. Very clean, average size for a London hotel with tea/coffee making facilities and TV etc. More than worth the money we paid.The Hotel location was absolutely perfect for sightseeing and shopping. A short walk to the Natural History Museum and the Albert and Victoria Museum, then 10 minutes further to Harrods and all of the Knightsbridge shops. The nearest tube is Gloucester Road which was right beside the Hotel. Locally the area is great, loads of lovely places to eat or shop. Tesco's is opposite the tube and Waitrose is equally close, perfect for breakfast etc. We ate at a fantastic steak restaurant called Black and Blue - the best steak I have ever tasted.There are two Holiday Inn Hotels in Kensington, the other is nearby and is probably a nicer hotel so not to be confused when booking. However, reviews on this site refer to this Holiday Inn as a high-rise monstrosity which I think is unfair. There are 27 floors to this hotel and if you are looking for individuality or boutique - forget it! Overall, for the money, location, and for the piece of mind knowing that its going to be clean and comfortable, look no further.I am fussy and trawled the internet looking at London hotels, goodness knows how I was brave enough to book a secret hotel room. No regrets and would definitely recommend."
304,828,"Nov 28 2006 	Perfectly adequate; excellent location	We stayed here for 4 nights - November 22-26 at an average rate of 75GBP a night excluding breakfast. Very good for London IMHO. Our room was on the 5th floor of this very tall and bunker like hotel building and it faced Cromwell Road. The view was good to the south and the room was surprisingly large, with a small refrigerator, desk, TB and double bed. The bathroom was 4 piece...quite adequate. It was clean and serviced promptly every day with fresh linen and towels. The black-out curtains were excellent.I'll pass on a few minor issues and tips- our room appeared to be below a disco....consequently Friday and Saturday night we were bothered by the thumping musis. We also got a low rumble from the traffic below. Earplugs were sufficient to mask the problem.- breakfast is outrageously expensive even with the 30% discount offered at the time of check-in. We turned this down at ate instead at nearby cafes.- Gloucester Road tube is a short walk away and on the direct line to Heathrow. Very convenient.- the hotel main entrance is hard to find - exit Gloucester Road tube station, turn left onto Cromwell Road, walk past the mall with the Waitrose sipermarket and take the first left. Cross the street and keep walking past the hotel loading dock area. The entrance will be on your right about three quarters of the way down the block. - there is a good internet cafe on the opposite site of Cromwell road from the hotel, just east of a large Italian restaurant.- November is an excellent time to visit London - no summer hordes of tourists, lots of time to wander around the sights and no problem getting discounted tickets to most shows."
305,828,"Nov 25 2006 	Very Good Location	Just got back from a 7 nite staty at this hotel. THe location was great, just aroung the corner from the tube. The room was small, but very clean, and the bathroom spotless. We got a good rate of $90 a nite thru hotwire. It was nice to have a frig in the room, we bought juice and croisants each morn from a local store and stored them. Over all, a nice experience."
306,828,"Nov 25 2006 	A solid hotel great location	I also booked this hotel with Lastminute.com, in their 4* star &quot;secret&quot; hotel promotion. Me and my boyfriend stayed there for 4 nights but booked the hotel for one night to find out what hotel I'm booking and then after reading some good reviews here (most of them were positive at that time) we decided to make a second booking for the other three nights. Unfortunately we weren't able to book the king size bed for the second booking so we were quite afraid to be moved to a twin room after the first night. When we arrived in the hotel the receptionist (very pleasant chinese girl) greeted us with a smile and confirmed our both reservations. She told us it would be a problem to find a king size non-smoking room with a view (all these requirements I mentioned in my reservation with lastminute) for us. We said that we could handle a smoking room with a view or even twin beds. She then called a manager to help her and this lady gave us a room for all 4 nights on the top floor with king size bed, view and no scent of smoke. We couldn't be more satisfied.  The room was quite small but it was about the size that I expect from hotels in London and it didn't really bother us. The view could not be possibly better with London Eye and Big Ben on the horizon. The bed was comfy, bathroom clean and modern. The shower pressure was a bit low but that's the price you pay for the top floor and it was well worth it ;-) Instead of minibar there was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar ;-) Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we had expected from our room.The staff were friendly, smiling and always greeting us. But we also didn't give them any hard times, so they didn't have to fake anything ;-)  The location of the hotel is just perfect. Only 100 metres from the tube. There are 3 lines at &quot;Gloucester Road&quot; station, one to take you directly to Piccadily Circus and Leicester Square, one going to London Bridge and Tower Hill. In less than 20 minutes you'll be in the heart of London.  The only downsize of this hotel I see in the cost of breakfast, with price of more than 15 for full English breakfast or 10 if booked in advance. You can definetely find something cheaper just few meters from the hotel. But this couldn't spoil our overall satisfaction with this hotel. I wasn't sure about 4* rating before staying there but to my great suprise all our needs were met 100%."
307,828,"Nov 21 2006 	2 out of 4 stars	I have to agree with the previous review. We had also booked through Lastminute Top Secret Hotels. The description of an 'ideally located 4* hotel with panormaic views of the city' sounded perfect. What we actually got was a 2* experience with a view of ahotel across the street.We too had booked a double room and received confirmation. On arrival we were allocated a twin room and when I called to enquire about changing I was told that there was no record of my request for a double room and that non were available.....click.....The room was uncomfortably small and very tired. No minibar or toiletries in the bathroom. I was very disappointed with the '4* hotel', but as my husband pointed out - it's a Holiday Inn, what do you expect?My advice would be to spend the extra few pounds and stay somewhere nice!"
308,828,"Nov 20 2006 	Shabby rooms basic facilties - no way is this a Four Star hotel	I booked this hotel through lastminute.com and their 'top secret hotels' service.... I wish I didn't. If you see a hotel listed there as &quot;Modern hotel, ideally situated in Kensington - 4* - London&quot; please avoid it!Check-in is allowed from 2pm, so I got to the reception at 220pm and was dealt with by a lady with 'Laura' on her badge. She mentioned that I had booked through lastminute.com and said that just 2 rooms were available. What?! So, twenty minutes after being allowed to check in to a hotel with over 900 (that's nine hundred!!) bedrooms only 2 are available. Obviously some of Holiday Inn's customers are less important than others...Even though I booked a double and recieved confirmation Laura decided to give us a twin. Thanks. The room itself (room 1702) was pokey, drab and stuffy. The flush on the toilet didn't work and produced only a trickle of water. There was no fridge or mini-bar, and no toiletries in the bathroom except a refillable soap dispenser which was screwed to the wall. Acceptable for a hotel which bills itself as 2 or even 3 star, but no way is this a 4 star hotel. A very basic, uncomfortable hotel."
309,828,"Nov 19 2006 	Great place to stay in London	My husband and I stayed in a double room for six nights this month at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum. Initially, I was disappointed in the small size of the room, but adjusted to it, and by the time we left ,wondered why I was initially concerned! The room was immaculate and the bathroom wonderful. As everyone mentions, the location was perfect for sightseeing. We purchased the 7 day traveler card for $42 US on our arrival at Victoria station, which allowed us unlimited use of the tube/bus system. It paid for itself several times over, plus, so easy just scanning the card than dealing with tickets. It also saved us $6 each on the Thames cruise to Greenwich.Our Hotwire price did not include breakfast, but several restaurants were nearby, and the hotel had a reasonable coffee/crossaint deal.So, if you get a good price, I wouldn't hesitate staying there. As mentioned by another reviewer, many airline crews stay at this hotel, and as most airline crews have more than the minimum standards for hotels in their contracts, it's a pretty good sign the hotel will be OK.Enjoy your London trip - we can't wait to return!"
310,828,"Nov 10 2006 	Wonderful Value!	What a wonderful value and great hotel in a very convenient spot. I was traveling alone and I felt very safe and comfortable. The rooms are small but that's just the way they are in the U.K. but immaculate!Good shower, comfortable bed. If there are 2 people in the room you won't both be able to leave your suitcases open but I took out what I needed for the next days. I was able to stop in and take a nap if I got too tired and there was a Tube station, grocery stores, restaurants and drugstore literally around the corner or across the street from this hotel. There's plenty in the neighborhood. Harrod's is a good walk up the street but there's loads to see while you are walking. Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and Science Museum also a walk up the street.The conceirge was great about getting me a van to Heathrow on the day I came home. It was 17 pounds and well worth it. Dropped me right at the airline and no hassles. I would definitely stay here again. Lots of pilots &amp; stewardesses coming and going. Very friendly, very accomodating."
311,828,"Oct 30 2006 	Great Standard Hotel	We booked through Hotwire and was able to get this hotel for $85/night. I have to admit, this is the way to go (either use Priceline or Hotwire) unless you have booked as part of a package. Don't expect to be provided breakfast with Hotwire/Priceline bookings (see previous post). The fact that you saved at least $100/night should compensate for having to get breakfast elsewhere, not to mention a better overall dining experience.Rooms are fairly small, but you have to expect this outside of North America. If you want to be able to Most importantly the rooms are:- very clean- quiet- bathrooms appear to have been updated recentlyThe hotel location is great. Only a block away from the tube, and you're still in zone 1, which makes it very convenient to get into the central area where most of the sights are. There are a couple of supermarkets close by, as is the V&amp;A museum. The neighbourhood is upscale, and very safe to walk around at any hour. If you're travelling as a couple, and not necessarily looking for a romantic hotel, but one that is close to everything, and comfortable, this is a good choice. London is extremely expensive, so if you're able to find a good deal through priceline/hotwire and you score this hotel, you won't be disappointed"
312,828,"Oct 12 2006 	The hotel makes one feel second class.	We stayed four nights at this hotel. We are professors emeriti who have lived in Europe, Africa, Australia, and the USA and have traveled to more than 50 countries. THE GOOD: The hotel is a short block from the Gloucester Road tube station, Waitrous grocery, Burger King, Kentucky Fried, Starbuck's, and a great pub -- Stannhope. THE BAD: The standard rooms (posted price $425 -- 222 pounds) are TINY. Even standard staterooms aboard cruise ships were the same size or larger! THE UGLY: Reserved this hotel through Hotwire and got a price of $90/night. That's a good price even though the room was tiny, however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through Hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast. The hotel's approach made us feel like second-class citizens, and reminded us that in England (and most of Europe), the class system is alive and applied almost everywhere. We ate a good English breakfast about a 100 meters from the hotel entrance at a two-table establishment named La Liaison for about $5.00. As an addendum: although the hotel was well located for the tube and shopping, it cost us $50 for a taxi to take us to and from the theater district and would have likewise been the fare to the British Museum or many other attractions. To these we took the tube, but it cost almost $20 for a one-day pass. Because of the room size, the lack of continental breakfast for those who reserve outside of the Holiday Inn web site, and the distance to many attractions, we WILL NOT STAY in the hotel during our next trip to London."
313,828,"Oct 9 2006 	Good if you don't pay retail price	I stayed here recently and got a great rate through priceline.com. The location is fab - near the Gloucester underground station and the Waitrose grocery store. There were a few restaurants nearby, but they seemed a bit touristy.When we checked in, we were given a room with 2 single beds and were told tough luck when we asked if we could switch to a room with a double. Also, one morning at 8:30am, the maid pounded on the door for about 10 minutes, trying to get into our room. We had deadbolted it from the inside and I have no idea why she wouldn't immediately realize &quot;oh they must be sleeping.&quot; She pounded on the door for so long that I eventually got dressed and went out to see what the racket was about. When I finally opened the door, she said she was &quot;just checking.&quot; (!!!) Other than that, our stay was uneventful and the room was clean, if a bit small. Another good thing is that the rooms have mini-fridges and it's great for storing ready-to-eat food from Waitrose. Tip: they mark down their food at the end of the day and you can get great deals on everything from sandwhiches to desserts at a fraction of the cost.Overall, this hotel is okay if you're on a budget or get a good deal through a discount site, but definitely NOT worth paying retail price for."
314,828,"Oct 7 2006 	Strongly recommended for anyone on a budget	My girlfriend and I got this hotel for $85/night on Priceline and our experience there was not bad at all. The room was not extravagant, but very comfortable. The location was excellent. We were on a lower floor, but the windows did a pretty good job of keeping out the street noise. The hotel exterior is a bit plain, but the room was comfortable. Water pressure in the shower was a tad weak, but acceptable. Toiletry products were adequate, but nothing special.Restaurants in the area were very good. We enjoyed Khyber Pass and the Prince Regent pub. Concierge staff gave excellent recommendations. (The Italian restaurant Vecciomondo, prominently located across the street is to be avoided by anyone that doesn't like waiting 40 minutes for tepid soup and school-cafeteria-quality pasta.) The hotel is located next to a supermarket and the room has a refrigerator."
315,828,Oct 6 2006	Great stay	Stayed here for five nights and loved it. Service was great and the concierge was very helpful. Loved the location as well. Will stay again on a future trip to London.
316,828,"Sep 25 2006	Excellent location shame about the service!!	Stayed at this hotel Friday 22nd - Monday 25th Sept. Fantastic location and local amenities i.e. Natural History Museam, Bars, Restaurants, shops and transport. And a fantastic view from the 23rd floor.BUT....When we wanted to watch a pay per view movie, was informed by reception there was a problem - it later transpired that we had been given an Aircrew room, where there is no mini-bar, pay per view movies turned off at reception, no menu's or room service available. Also we were later informed that only executive rooms had the service of mini bar!When querying this with the staff (contacted them twice whilst staying) on check out, we were advised it was a system error - they would not take responsibility for the problems we had incurred!At checking out we queued for 10 - 15 minutes to be informed they only took groups at this desk, and we had to rejoin another queue for a further 10 minutes to check out! There were no signs to advise which desk to use when checking out!"
317,828,"Sep 24 2006 	Good budget hotel	I got this hotel for $88/night through Priceline. The location is great and the Tube station is very close.I had a small issue at checkin but I attribute that to jet lag, having just arrived in Lodon after a 10 hour flight. The desk staff were helpful and friendly. Checkout was easy.The pub was pretty good and not too crowded.I asked for and got a non-smoking room. It was small but clean. Some of the public areas around the restaurant on the ground floor were smoky, but on the whole not too bad.The public areas were nice and bright. The breakfast was OK but nothing great. You could do better elsewhere. There is a chinese restaurant on the corner near the hotel which was pretty good. Concierge was helpful but only used them twice.Pros: good hotel for the price and location.Cons: a bit of attitude from the breakfast staff.Would absolutely stay there again next time."
318,828,"Sep 23 2006	Good location bit shabby	I stay in a lot of holiday inn's on business.This was my first time in this one. It's apparently the largest HI in the world, and has something like 27 floors. The room whilst a reasonable size was definitely due for refurbishment. Nothing was dirty as such but just looked fairly old and a bit shabby. Apart from that, the staff were friendly and the location is great. There are restaurants and a tube station within 5 minutes walk. Kensington is one of the best areas in London. This hotel is close to heathrow (no noise disturbance) and as such is very busy with tour groups."
319,828,"Sep 15 2006 	Great Location Comfy Hotel	My husband and I stayed here in March 2006. The location is incredibly convenient, with lots of restaurants and easily walkable to the tube. The view from our windows was great; we were on the 19th floor and had a fabulous view of London. The room was clean and comfortable if a bit on the small side. The maid service was excellent and we felt very happy with our choice. Overall, a great choice for a budget traveler. We chose this hotel based on other people's reviews, so we thought we'd return the favor by posting our confirmation of how good this place is. (We're American from New York City)"
320,828,"Sep 14 2006	Never again will I stay at this hotel	I have visited London many times over thirty years. My usual preferred hotel was not available and I took this Holiday Inn because I could get flyer points for the stay and I always like to stay in Kensington or Knightsbridge.The rooms are the size of closets and I couldn't upgrade after I saw it because all the rooms are the same size. This is a hotel for large tour groups who want cheap prices. There isn't even enough floor space to lay your suitcases, yet the closet is very tiny and there are only 3 small drawers to unpack. The bathroom has similar dimensions. It was clean however.The food in the restaurant is terrible. If you need internet access, it is only open during business hours, Mon-Fri. just when you need to be out. One of the concierge's was very good, the other was unfriendly.The single thing to recommend this hotel is the location, which is excellent. Other hotels around it would be a better choice."
321,828,"Sep 9 2006 	Great location	We booked this hotel with Hotwire and got an excellent deal.The location is EXCELLENT, just round the corner from the subway. We booked a double standard and got an upgrade to a double superior as courtesy because there were no standard rooms available with duble bed. The room was very confortable, but rather small (imagine the standard one).No breakfast included in the fee, but you have a coffee machine in the bedroom, and on the opposite street there are 2 supermarkets and a couple of restaurants."
322,828,"Sep 8 2006 	Excellent!!	I stayed there for 9 nights, all I can say that its one of the best places I've ever been to. Friendly helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms and not to mention its great location. I had a pleasant stay and if I ever went back to London I intend to stay there again. I highly recommend it."
323,828,"Sep 1 2006 	Ideal London base hotel	This hotel is in a very good location - tube, buses, restaurants, shopping and museums all within very easy walking distance. Good buffet breakfast. Rooms large for London hotels and quiet. Two restaurants worth trying are Giraffe on Kensington High Street and Lillo and Franco Italian Restaurant, Kensington Square. Both of these offer good variety of good food at very reasonable prices and suitable for children."
324,828,"Aug 30 2006 	A wonderful stay	This was our first trip to London, and my husband and I were able to snag 3 nights at the Holiday Inn Kensingrton Forum for $65 per night through Priceline. Although the room was small, it was comfortable and clean--especially the pillows and king size bed! The bathroom was also small, and the water pressure in the shower was not great. It was nice having both 220 and 110 voltage for electrical outlets in both the bathroom and room. Previous reports mentioned refrigerator problems, ie: being charged for items which were only moved around, but our mini refrig was not stocked at all, but we could use it for our outside- purchased items. There is a nice trouser press in the room. By the way, important to note is that in order to make the lights and air conditioning work in the room, you must insert your room keycard into a slot as you walk into the room. No one tells you this, but it helps to know. The concierge was adequate, but did not go out of his way for us. We did not eat at all in the hotel, as there are plenty of more reasonably priced restaurants and pubs in the area. In just a 2 minute walk, you will find a Burger King, Starbucks, Tesco (simialr to a 7/11), Pub, and two Patisseries. (One was named Illy's and had excellent food---we ate there for breakfast and dinner).Gloucester Underground Station (The Tube) is a 2 minute walk--directly across from above mentioned stores, and this is the way to travel in London! It is very easy, clean, and there are color coded signs directing you everywhere.. Seats are comfortable and fabric covered. Extremely clean and safe!We took a private car service from airport to hotel, and it cost 55 pounds. One word about the hop on, hop off bus tours--Be sure to note if it includes a live narration or audio, The live narration is much more informative. Harrod's is a 30 minute walk from the hotel, and a must see! All in all, if you do not mind giving up the Euopean atmosphere, the Holiday Inn gives you a comfortable stay with the most convenient location."
325,828,"Aug 23 2006 	Another great stay	I just finished an 18 day stay at the HILKF. It was great. I had been here for a week in April, and had a similarly good stay then.I arrived early and the room was not ready, so I took a big bus tour (even though I have visited London many times, it was fun, and a good way for the weary to spend those awkward hours before checkin). Returned midafernoon and was given what must be the smallest room in the hotel (2031). Nothing wrong, just too small. I mentioned it to the desk person when I put my stuff in the safe, and she suggested coming back the next morning to see what could be done. I did this, and was asked to pack up everything and leave it in the room, and come back around 4 in the afternoon, which I did. They moved my stuff to room 1524, which was wonderful. Not one of the deluxe rooms, but a nice size and quite comfortable. The cleaning staff were terrific throughout the stay, and the rest of the hotel staff were uniformly helpful.The HILKF is a very large hotel, with lots of Americans and people from all over, particularly from the Middle East, and has been mentioned many times here, American Airlines puts its flight crews up in this hotel. It is not a boutique hotel, and is geared for business people and tourists who know how to take care of their own business without much help from them. That's fine with me. I look forward to returning.One unfortunate thing: On my previous visit I had enjoyed breakfast at Dino's, down the street on Gloucester Road. While I was there it closed, and is being refitted for another use. But there are plenty of places to get breakfast in the neighborhood."
326,828,"Aug 20 2006 	Absolutely excellent stay!!	We stayed here on a short break from 17th - 19th August 2006. We managed to get a good deal on lastminute and after trawling the internet seeing the standards of hotels within our budget did not have high expectations however we were pleasantly surprised. The room was much larger than expected with a huge comfortable bed, desk, sofa and ample bathroom.Location was great being only a few yards from the Gloucester Road tube on Piccadilly, Circle and District lines and was therefore an ideal base for our sight seeing visit. The area surrounding the hotel was very nice with many places to eat and drink etc. Further approval was given by the apparent use of the hotel by at least one major airline. Surely air stewards and pilots cannot be wrong!Would definitely stay at this hotel again next time!!!"
327,828,"Aug 14 2006 	Great Hotel!	We stayed here Aug 5th-9th and found it to be an excellent place to stay. First of all it's the hub for American Airlines flight attendants so you know it picked well. The rooms are great, American electrical outlet, trouser press, coffee and tea, bathrobe and a great bathroom with dove products. The concierge is extremely helpful, and Golden Tours partners up with the hotel so they're more than happy to help you with a tour (we did Stonehenge, Salisbury and Bath and it was excellent, they pick you up from the hotel!)Don't use the restaurant or room service, there's plenty of places to eat outside the hotel, there's a mini Tesco for groceries, a larger grocery store (don't buy microwaveable products, though, it took me an hour to get them to microwave it for me) plenty of internet cafe's, a Paul's Boulangerie right by the tube, great fro a quick breakfast, the Gloucester Road tube stop is a 3 minute walk, plenty of busses to High Street (fabulous shopping!) (7 minute ride) The tube is 10 minutes from most of the big sightseeing spots. The pub in the hotel seemed lively but we didn't go out much.Overall I highly recommend it! Great location and can't beat the price and the comfort!"
328,828,"Jul 30 2006	Great Hotel in nice area of London	The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum was a great place for us to start our UK vacation. The staff were helpful and friendly at any time of day. The rooms were very comfortable, the beds in particular. Everything was clean and in working order.The Knightsbridge area was very nice. We felt very comfortable walking around at night. The Gloucester tube station is a block away. It's a smaller station and therefore very simple to navigate. We're very glad we chose this hotel."
329,828,"Jul 25 2006 	Great place to stay especially for a first-timer	Not sure what my nightly rate was since it was part of a package through Hotwire[--], but I did get a great deal and, especially since this was my first trip outside of the United States this hotel met some critical needs for me - clean, safe, easy access to both the underground and buses, actually within walking distance to the V&amp;A and Natural History Museum and close to some reasonable choices related to dining out (although nothing in London was cheap to eat! My daugher and I average about $70 a dinner regardless of whehter we ate out or did room service - - YIKES). There was a supermarket at the Gloucester UG station which was within two blocks of the hotel and a charming &quot;hole in the wall&quot; to get a HUGE mug of morning coffee, bagels and English breakfast. Since this location is the designated layover site for American Airlines, there were tons of pilots and flight attendants everywhere, but that added to the &quot;familiar&quot; feeling of having Americans around. Have heard that the regular rates are pricey and certainly wouldn't pay more than $100 or so a night as that would be too much as it is, but at the right price, would be a good choice for anybody!"
330,828,"Jul 24 2006	Not so good	We had 4 twin rooms booked and prepaid two months in advance for one night on 10th July 06. When we arrived, we were asked by the receptionist what room we wanted. We told him that we specifically booked for four twin rooms. No comments were given by the receptionist.Then we were asked if we wanted rooms nears to each other. Our answer was yes but if they could not do it, we will be ok with all the rooms on the same floor. No comments were given by the receptionist.When we were given the keys, to our surprise, two of the rooms were double and were on the different floor to the other two. When asked, the receptionist's reply was that he could not do what we asked for.Furthermore, one of the room given was occupied by someone else and we could not open one room with the key given. We had to ask the receptionist twice for them to realize that they have given us a wrong key.In conclusion, rooms were small but clean, internet charge was expensive (15 Pounds/day) and reception staff/booking system was hopeless."
331,828,"Jul 23 2006 	Great location	Just came home from a wonderful stay at this hotel. Booked through the Holiday Inn website. Received the leisure rate of only 65 pounds including full English buffet breakfast. Pleasant staff, clean hotel, comfortable beds, with a great location. Rooms small, but adequate. Close to the tube. Safe location. Supermarket located on way back from tube. Would definately stay here again."
332,828,"Jul 20 2006 	Good Price Great Location Would definately stay there again!	A complete surprise (we booked off hotwire), I found the Ken Forum to be a great hotel. The neighbourhood more than made up for the standard &quot;cereal-box&quot; feeling of the hotel. It was clean, the maids were fantastic, our room was surprisingly large (it had a pull-out couch), and the beds were comfortable. The Glouster Road tube station is just two minutes away, along with other food stores, pubs, internet cafes, restaurants etc. A quick walk to the Natural History Museum, Science Centre, V&amp;A. Shopping at Harrods, H&amp;M etc. was also a fifteen minute walk away. With three of us in the room, we managed to pay $30 each per night (hostel prices!). Anyway it may not have the charm or history of other hotels in London, but for the price/location we would (and will) visit again. Besides, you shouldn't spend a lot of time at the hotel anyway!P.S there is a pizza place in the mini mall across from Waitrose. Its a chain but the food was cheap and delicious! We saved some money by ordering take out and making a picnic."
333,828,"Jul 15 2006	Excellent location clean but small	Our room was small, but very clean and appeared to be newly decorated. The room contained a large closed, TV, desk and mini-bar. The mini-bar did have a small section set aside for guest use. The bathroom while small had a tub and wonderful shower and a clothesline.The best feature of this hotel is it's location. With a block or two are: a huge Waitrose, a Tesco, Starbucks, launderette, many resturants and the Gloucester Road Tube station. A little further (about 4 or 5 blocks) are the Natural History Museum and the V&amp;A."
334,828,"Jul 13 2006	We'd stay here again.	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum in May 2006. Our choice was based on reviews from Trip Advisor. The room was small, as lower priced rooms tend to be in London. But the room was clean, the bathroom was modern with tub and shower and all the hot water we wanted and there was a hairdryer. There was also a 120v outlet in the room for a battery charger. The hotel has a small store, restaurant, and pub, all of which we used and enjoyed. The Gloucester road tube is 5 minutes away as well as a Post Office with an ATM, a Waitrose and Tesco market and a large variety of restaurants. We were on the 16th floor which gave us a great view of the city as well. We will gladly stay at this hotel again on our next visit."
335,828,"Jul 10 2006	Loved it.	Stayed from 10-15 June 2006, and chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews. Great choice. We paid 100 Pounds per room per night on an internet pre-paid rate. Front desk staff varied from gracious to rude, but they were efficient. Rooms were not large, but they were quiet, comfortable and clean, and everything worked (including the quiet A/C on two 32C days). There is a large room on the ground floor for storing luggage if you arrive in the a.m. as we did. We watched the World Cup games in the pub on the ground floor (nice for a hotel pub) but we didnt use the hotel restaurants (see below) and saved a ton of money. Be careful of the hotel room mini bar as anything removed will be automatically charged to the room, whether consumed or not. There was also a 50p charge for access to an outside line for phone card calls.Having the Gloucester Rd. tube stop only a short (2 minute walk) was a delight, as was the Waitrose grocery store as part of the same complex. Our family of five had curry takeaway dinners from there that were delicious, plus the usual fruit, snacks, and drinks for three teen boys. There is also a decent wine shop as part of the Waitrose market. Just across the road is a Tesco 24 hr. market which was great for morning fruit, croissants, jelly donuts and drinks, a Starbucks two doors down for coffee, and a French patisserie for croissants when Tesco was out. One of Londons best Indian restaurants (Bombay Brasserie) is also less than a block from the hotel, and we had a noisy, fun meal at Bugis Street (Singaporean style Asian fare). We also used the nearby internet caf to check in for our return flight (only about 50p for 30 minutes, which may be the best bargain in London)."
336,828,"Jul 5 2006	perfect for seeing london	we stayed here in june 2006 withour baby and nanny for our honeymoon. centrally located and a block from glouster street which has tons of great pubs and restaurants, this hotel was perfect for us. we got adjoining rooms and a crib and a smokin' deal of 89.00 per night on hotwire. smallish rooms, but totally adequate for our needs. has a pub of it's own downstairs and an excellent concierge. a fifteen minute walk from kensington gardens, a great market right next store...really can't say anything bad....."
337,828,"Jul 3 2006	Perfectly located Perfectly clean	Our family of four booked two rooms through Priceline bidding at $84/night for four nights. We were pleasantly surprised by perfectly functional clean rooms. The minimalist rooms have no dirty bedspreads and instead offer pleasant comforters with fresh comforter covers similar to those one finds in the best hotels. The bathrooms are basic with soap dispensers reminiscent of a gym, but were uniquely clean without dirty corners even to a critical eye. The American electrical plugs are a big plus for charging cameras and other gadgets.The location is perfect with many everything you need just outside the door including a great French patisserie and coffee shop. Because the hotel is large, there is usually a line of taxis just outside the door, but the tube is also just a block away.( If there is a way to avoid climbing stairs with luggage at this station it was not obvious.)The lobby is a bit depressing. Arm chairs are grubby. Service is not particularly attentive, but not rude. Watch out for telephone costs; calls to mobile phones in England are exorbitant if made from the room.The major downside of this hotel is the entirely American atmosphere. If you want your English vacation experience to include a hotel with an English ambiance you should look elsewhere."
338,828,"Jul 1 2006	Location location location!	We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on a post cruise visit to London. Trying to book the reservation through Holiday Inn's website was confusing (unclear pricing and vague descriptions of child rates, bedding, etc., none of which was the hotel's fault), but once we obtained a clear confirmation of what we were getting, there were no problems on arriving at the hotel. Front desk efficient, concierge was busy and helpful, room was adequate and very clean. The nasty, archaic coffeepots were a joke, but with a Starbucks around the corner, who cares? The nearby internet cafe was a great value and a big help since we travelled sans laptops. Had a few minor problems in the room, but were attended to promptly. Best part of all is the location, loved the Gloucester Road tube station nearby and the South Kensington area in general, very safe to walk around in any time day or night. A real oasis in London, and a convenient tube ride from Heathrow airport. With a tube pass, you can ride anywhere in zone 1 easily which saves some real pounds, a factor at the horrific exchange rate for dollars. Gloucester Road tube station is at the westernmost side of zone 1, making it a perfect location between the airport and central London. Guess that's why all the airline employees stay there."
339,828,"Jun 28 2006	Adequate but that's all.	If you want a simple and extremely small room then this is the place. Extremely expense and in a nice neighbourhood. The rooms were clean and the bed seemed that it is due for changing but other than that it was fine.The breakfast was a rip off. We made the mistake of ordering the bed and breakfast package and paying an addition 30 pounds, for eggs.Having stayed a few other times in London I would suggest there is better value."
340,828,"Jun 27 2006	Great Price Great Location	We booked through Priceline &amp; got a room for $90 per night for 24 &amp; 25 June. I'm PC Gold so was assigned my request of a high floor n/smoking double room after using the PC check-in desk. We ended up in Room 2601 with an amazing view over the city. The room itself is compact but there's enough space for a long weekend. The large double bed was very comfortable - extra towels &amp; pillows were delivered promptly. The bathroom was a good size with an excellent shower and was spotlessly clean. Our minibar didn't work, so we had the full use of the fridge for beers and water. Ice is available in the kitchenette opposite Room 2519 on the 25th floor.One glitch we encountered was faulty a/c in the room... it was a very hot weekend in London and it was most uncomfortable. I did report it to both the Hotel management &amp; Guest Relations.The location of the hotel is superb - 2 minutes walk from Gloucester Road tube (Picadilly line direct from LHR). Come out of the station, go to your right, walk 100 yards to the next corner - the Millennium is on your left) and the HI Forum is on the right at the next corner. The No. 74 bus takes you straight down to Knightsbridge/Harrods etc. and the Tube will take you anywhere else you desire!Two dining tips...Chez Gerard (various locations, but we went to the Belvedere Road restaurant, 2 mins from the London Eye). Stunning food, amazing service... pay it a visit!Dino's Italian Restaurant (various locations but this is on Gloucester Road down from Black &amp; Blue steakhouse) - absolutely atrocious. Save your money &amp; eat anywhere else!"
341,828,"Jun 10 2006	Okay but pricey	Rooms are large for London, but tiny for US standards (can't roll luggae around the bed, and bathrooms aren't big enough for two people). VERY expensive unless you're used to Manhattan rates. Car park is outrageous, $55 here per night. Location is hard to beat though. Walking to buses and tube about one block, cafes all around. Some at the front desk are snobby, but it's still just a HI. Doorman wouldn't let us use the luggage rack wihtout his tip. Quirky, but nice. I'd stay again if company paid, but not my pay again."
342,828,"Jun 6 2006	Great Hotel	The hotel was clean, the beds were comfortable and the location was great. We didn't eat at the hotel - there were some great cafe's just around the block with great food at a much better price. Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, the Museum of Natural History and the Victoria and Albert were all within easy walking distance. The tube station was also just around the block. We will definitly stay here again."
343,828,"Jun 5 2006	Good location but expensive	I suppose it was just about OK but given that I booked relatively late and it cost me 125 room only, I thought it was not worth the money. If it had cost say 80 or less then OK. We were in London for the Chelsea Flower Show (which may be why the rooms were at a premium) and it is convenient for the Tube and taxis to and from the Show - and anywhere else. The hotel is a large one and is looking a little tatty. The bedrooms are very small and the breakfast is very ordinary although there is a good choice. There are lots of good restaurants nearby - we went to Chutney Mary's a really fantastic Indian just a short taxi ride and highly recommended. Maybe I'm being a little harsh so if you can get this hotel at a good rate it is probably just about worth it, as it has an excellent location."
344,828,"Jun 3 2006	Awesome location comfortable rooms	Great service and perfect location! It is only a 2 minute walk from the Glocouster Tube stop and is a beautiful and quiet part of London. There are plenty of restaurants around the area, as well as a Starbucks and a 24 hour Tesco Express (7-11 equivalent). The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Natural History Museum, an awesome museum for any one interested in archaeological artifacts, and it is FREE to everyone. Once you enter, there are giant fossils of various prehistoric reptiles and mammals (giant armadillo, t-rex, etc). Also adjacent to that museum is the Victoria and Albert Museum (must see!).Concierge was also helpful with any directions you need and also helped us look up times for shows in London.Our room was on the 7th floor and was extremely well organized and clean. The trouser press is a nice addition to the room. Showers were small but definitely sufficient. The room also included 110V outlets in case you forgot to bring a travel converter. Internet is not included in the rate and you will have to goto the internet caf down the street from the hotel (1/2 block past metro stop).One warning: The mini fridge in the room charges you automatically for any drinks if you move them or take them out in any way! The drink is pressing down on a button by default and if you take it out, the button will click and pop up, meaning that you have just been charged for the drink! Make sure to check your bill daily to verify you have not been mistakenly charged and to get your refund. Front desk was very prompt in taking out those charges. You can fit a few beverages into the mini fridge for your own personal use too.The hotel is very busy, caters to both business and vacation customers. I noticed that a few airlines use this hotel for their flight crew. So, expect to see groups of 30 workers dressed in their full airline uniforms when you check in."
345,828,"Jun 3 2006	Number 1 in this star bracket	We stayed at this hotel from the 6-8th May and were very pleased with our choice thanks to other trip advisor reviews. It definately exceeded our expectations for a London hotel in this star bracket. For the price, cleanliness, service and quality it definately deserves a higher star rating. It is a 5 minute walk to the tube as well as the Hop on Hop off bus stop. We found the gentleman at the concierge desk to be extremely helpful who went out of his way to offer us advice. We were also lucky to check in at 9.00am which we were most grateful of after a 24 hour flight with children. The rooms are small but no smaller than other hotels we have stayed in, most importantly they were very clean and well appointed and the bathrooms looked new. This hotel accomodates a huge number of airline personnel from many airline companies and I think that speaks for itself. No airline is going to accomodate its pilots or staff in a place that isn't going to guarantee good quiet sleep in comfortable beds. Otherwise their employees wouldn't last long. I would definately recommed this hotel to anyone as it is unbeatable for price and location in London."
346,828,Jun 1 2006	Great Hotel and Location	We took a last minute weekend trip to London and I check tripadvisor before booking with travelocity. It was a bargain price for the hotel and it was great ..We did not eat in hte hotel because there are plenty of restaurants around. The tube was one block away and on the way there was a supermarket. Although I did not book a non smoking room they offered me one and did not charge extra. The room was inmaculate clean. In trip advisor I noticed a comment on their refrigerator that they had been charged for things from the mini-bar. The person indicated that he moved things around in the refrigerator. The mini-bar is computerized so when you remove an item it will automatically count as consumed. The refrigerator does provide a space for your items. it is small size ( like four large cans (1pint each) can fit in it). I would recommend this hotel to anyone ...anytime! We stayed four nights at the hotel ...
347,828,"May 30 2006	Good Location Bad Service	Not knowing London, I relied on the reviews of this site to make my decision on where to stay. I wanted a good location, above all else, and this hotel fills that need. Just a short walk from the hotel, about 3 minutes in fact, is the Gloucester Road underground station. This makes getting around the city extremely efficient. There's also a mini-mall with a Boots pharmacy and a grocery store between the underground station and the hotel. If you're a family vacation traveller, you'll probably make use of the grocery store often becuse food in London is expensive when you consider the terrible USD-GPB exchange rate. We often picked up croissants and juice at the grocery store for breakfast.I wish that the hotel had better service, however. To get ice, you have to first get a bucket from room service. They charge 2.5 GBP for this! Despite having the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on our doorknob, someone came to the door at 7:30 am and wanted our dirty dishes so they could be washed. We didn't have any dirty dishes - we'd only requested an ice bucket! The check-in staff is rude and abrupt, and the long lines are unacceptable. On any given day, I noticed only 2-3 people working the check-in desk, but there were as many as 20 people in line waiting for assistance. The bell man was of little use. They never offered to signal a taxi, or to help with luggage. The phone in the room misdialed every time I used their speed dials (and it used rotary pulse, versus touch-tone, so I couldn't use my calling card). To get Room Service, it called Housekeeping. To call the front desk, I got the concierge. Each time the wrong call was connected, the employee on the other end sighed angrily and then transferred me.For a similarly good location (northeast London), you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service."
348,828,"May 30 2006	Enjoyed our stay	We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We got a room for $89 per night for 3 nights (May 13-16) through Hotwire.com. It's a great location and the rooms are nice and clean and yes, a bit small but definately NOT tiny. I think we were in the smallest available and it had a king bed, a sofa, a desk (with an American plug which was GREAT since our converter is a bit dodgy), a tv, etc. Plenty of space for us to chill out in it after a day of seeing the sights. Bathroom was smaller than U.S. holiday inn bathrooms but it had a tub with shower, a toilet, and a sink--rooms come with hairdryers, iron, etc as well --so really nothing to complain about. It's a great location VERY near the Gloucester Rd tube stop (maybe a 2 minute stroll and in a nice area). Perfect if you are going to see the sights in London--great location to get around from--right downtown.ONE thing to note: there are 2 holiday inns at this tube stop (1 about 1/2 block closer and so you'll see it first)! be sure you are at the right one when you check in--this one is a tall building with a big lobby complete with restaurant and bar--the other is smaller. we got nearly all the way checked in at the other (they had a guest with our same last name booked through expedia) before realizing that we were in the wrong place!We really loved our stay here and would definately stay again. It's a great deal for a nice downtown hotel."
349,828,"May 29 2006	Two Tips That You'll Thank Me For...	A decent hotel with a great location. The raves about the location are well deserved. Many restaurants in the neighborhood, ranging from swanky to fast food to haute cuisine.I stayed in a fifth floor room. Admittedly a single traveller (and using Priority Club points) but I had no complaints about the size of the room. Bathroom was small but this room was typical size of many London (and for that matter, New York) hotel rooms. A decent quality hotel and you won't be disappointed staying there for a night or a week.But here are my two tips that you'll want to thank me for. 1) The entrance is NOT on Cromwell Road, even though the address is Cromwell Road. The entrance is on a side street parallel to Cromwell Road, so check a map before you try to find the entrance! Or just use your intuition once you recognize where the hotel is and enter from the back.2) The room lights only work (at least in the room that I had) by sticking your room key card in a special holder in the room. There's no sign indicating that, no one told me that as a I checked in but I had a hunch something was amiss when I overheard another guest as I was checking in telling the front desk that his lights didn't work. When I had the same situation I asked a room cleaner on the floor and she told me how it worked. It is hardly intuitive and unless sometime tells you won't know what to do with the room key (unless you've stayed in hotels that use this kind of system!)Enjoy the hotel... it's a solid property, with an amazing location! On balance probably should have given it five stars. Rooms are functional, modern and nicely appointed.Again the location just can't be beat!"
350,828,"May 28 2006	Great Location - Just fine for our stay	Very convenient location one block from Gloucester Road tube station. Huge hotel full of airline pilots &amp; attendants. Very small rooms (I think our room on our last cruise was larger!) but then we don't spend much time in our room so it worked for us. At $75 per night via Priceline, this was a great deal. Several decent pubs, 24-hour Tesco and nice coffeeshop nearby (free croissant with morning coffee solved our breakfast issues). Comfortable beds and no noise issues. Nice views from our 17th floor room. Would recommend to others."
351,828,"May 24 2006	Nice location--tiny rooms	We stayed at this hotel from May 8-11,2006. It is in a very good location for catching the tube or the Hop On/Hop Off bus tour. Lots of restaurants, but not a lot of shopping in the area.  The hotel caters to airline personnel, cruise tourists, and is a good choice for someone that wants to have a safe location. The staff were friendly and helpful. As stated in previous reviews, this hotel has the smallest rooms that we have ever stayed in. There is one small closet that backs up to the entrance door. In addition to not being able to open a closet door, there is an ironing board and iron in it. We were pre-cruising and had 6 pieces of luggage that had to sit out on the sofa/bed due to lack of space. There were only 2 of us, but if a family tried to camp out and open up the sofa bed, they would have to pick their spot in the room for the entire stay and just stay put. To put it mildly, we had more room in our cabin on the ship, than in the hotel. Aside from that, the hotel was clean, tiny bathroom with nice big tub, and a room with a view that had extra inside windows to sound proof the room. You could still open them and let a breeze in. Forget the buffet English breakfast in the morning---you can go anywhere for breakfast in the area for less than $30 pp. There are coffee and pastry shops around the corner and fast food. There is also a grocery store in a shopping plaza on the corner where you can buy take out food, wine, etc. We enjoyed our stay---albeit was only for 3 days."
352,828,"May 14 2006	Good location average hotel	Good location if you want to be near the Piccadilly line to Heathrow (Gloucester Road tube), but otherwise very average. Small rooms, but adequate. All staff were very friendly except check in staff who could do with going on whatever course the rest of the staff have taken. Quite snooty or surly service at reception, from two separate people. Air-conditioning didn't work and they never managed to fix it. Newspapers not delivered. Breakfast was fine - the usual buffet."
353,828,"May 11 2006	Solid Deal in a Great Location	Very clean hotel in an excellent section of London. Very convenient to Gloucester Road Tube Station, on the Picadilly line, with access to the Circle and City lines. Restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies are all within walking distance. We requested a non-smoking double, but were checked in to a smoking, twin because the hotel was over booked our first night. We were so tired, it didn't really matter, and the staff was super helpful in getting us to our non-smoking double for the remaining five nights of our stay. I would stay here again if I were to travel to London on a moderate budget."
354,828,"May 9 2006	Some issues	Slow tub drain and no hot water. They tried to resolve the issue, but we were given another room with a slow drain. The manager claimed that this was normal. We ended up taking the second room as we already wasted an hour dealing with it, and just wanted to get on with our day.Small rooms. We reserved a room with 2 twin/single beds. These rooms are very small/narrow; not much room for moving around/luggage."
355,828,"May 9 2006	Beware of false mini-bar charges!	I tried to resolve this with the management, but they wouldn't even respond after several attempts. We recently came from the US and stayed from 4-12-06 - 4-17-06. The first night we were there, we were awakened to a fire alarm and ended up vacating our room in our pajamas, VERY cold. I didn't complain about that. That same night we had gone to the store and purchased some liquor, cheese, juice, water, etc., for the room and stored a couple of things in the mini bar/refrigerator. We noticed that the mini bar seemed pretty bleak and there were a lot of empty spaces in the door where the little mini liquor bottles go and there was enough room for us to put our things if we moved some of the bigger items that were in there around (although we did not know what was SUPPOSED to be in there when we checked in). The next morning, I noticed that the mini bar had a sticker on the inside that warned if items were removed you may be charged for them (keep in mind that we removed NOTHING, but simply moved some things around). So, I went down to the front desk that very morning and expressed my concern. The desk clerk looked up my room number and said that there were no charges from the mini bar and that the cleaning lady would know to take inventory and not to worry about it. He indicated that if you move items around in there, it is just a &quot;trigger&quot; for them to check it, but that we wouldn't be charged if nothing was missing. I also told him that it seemed like there were a lot of empty spaces in the door and in the refrigerator and he assured me that what was in there was what was supposed to be in there, as the cleaning people know what to look for. I told him that we were also using it for storing some items we bought and asked him if it was ok, to which he responded &quot;of course&quot;. Weeks later, I got home from work to find a revised bill in the mail, on which there were mini bar charges. We did not consume or remove ANYTHING from the mini bar. We never do when we go anywhere and buy our own things. The only thing I can imagine is that is was not stocked from the previous people that stayed in that room, but I don't know. What I DO know is that I have been falsely charged for these items, which your invoice states (2 Beer/1 7Up/1 Tonic/2 Vodka/1 Whisky/1 Gin) 29.75 pounds. I asked that they credit my account for these charges immediately, as I would hate to be taken advantage of by such a reputable company. Never responded and now have to dispute with my bank."
356,828,"May 7 2006	Excellent Hotel Excellent Location!	We only stayed here for one night but it was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!! The staff on the desk were professional and helpful. The room was a good size, with comfortable beds, and the bathroom was larger than most london hotels with good shower gels and shampoo on hand!!Location wise it is a 5 min walk to the tube and you are on the circle, district and picadilly line. We will definitely be staying here again!!"
357,828,"May 7 2006	Great location!	Got this hotel at 77$ US on priceline[-]. Excellent deal from this well located hotel in London. Located 2 minutes walk from the Gloucester tube station. Small, clean room. Also located 2 station from Victoria station where we took the Gatwick express train to Gatwick airport. Would definetely recommend this hotel for a tourism stay in London."
358,828,"Apr 30 2006 	Tiny Room good location	I stayed at the hotel for two nights to attend a conference in the same hotel. The conference facilities are very good and efficient but the hotel standard is just average. The rooms are tiny, which is not a problem if you are there for a short time, but anyone with claustrophobia should stay away. Despite other reviews i found the bed comfortable and slept like a baby.The staff were generally nice however the staff in the bar/coffee shop in the main lobby were extremely rude most of the time. The location is great though to get to the Tube and sites around West london and i got a good rate for the room. Hotel rooms are expensive in London so if you want something convenient, cheapish and near to a Tube this is ideal but be wary of the fact that this is a massive hotel and there will be queues for breakfast, check in, etc."
359,828,"Apr 24 2006	Big hotel small rooms even smaller charm	The top feature of The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is its location, in a superb area of London that's clean, safe and interesting. Being so close to Gloucester Road station on the Piccadilly Line is a real treat for sightseeing.However what you find at this hotel is 1000 rooms all squeezed into an admittedly large building, but one that in my opinion would be a gem of a hotel if the rooms were halved. Take a look at the breakfast room to see just how big an issue size is. The queues are back to the lift and you'll spend a while waiting for a seat. Checking in and out is also slow, public areas are always full of people and the hotel simply lacks any charm found at most of the Holiday Inns I've stayed in.We booked an executive room with the idea of being situated on a high floor with a nice view of the City. However, exec floors are 4-7 so instead there was no view whatsoever, and quite a bit of noise from outside. My recommendation is to avoid the extra cost of the room - you only get a few extras anyway and the rooms &amp; bathrooms are the same size as standard - which are tiny. They are however well presented and functional. Just don't plan on spending too much time in them (this was our plan as the stay preceeded a long flight!!).Staff were mostly ethnic origin, presenting a couple of communication problems at check in ; room service was slow and fairly bland (- we left our tray outside the room &amp; it was still there at 12 noon next day) and we noticed a lack of acknowledgement by any staff as we walked around the premises, again unusual for such a high profile company.Whilst London remains one of the most expensive Cities to stay in, well over 3 figures was paid (UK pound) and that considered we were very dissapointed with our stay. Nothing special at all."
360,828,"Apr 23 2006 	Falling Standards	I am in the Hospitality Trade and I have been using this hotel for the last 4 years on a regular basis with no problems. However, recently standards have fallen. I stayed in room 354 - on the Exec Floor - no bathrobes, no newspaper delivery ( pre ordered), room service crockery standing outside room for almost 24 hours un movedand poor service in Bistro. Also ripped off in hotel shop - the shop assistant short changed me. The matress was overdue for replacement too !Not impressed at all and will not stay again despite good location. There are other alternatives in the area so check them out as these now include the new ParkCity Hotel."
361,828,"Apr 18 2006	Great Location Good Hotel	The reviews on the website for this hotel were overwhelmingly positive and, after checking it out, I got a good rate on the hotel website and booked in. It was in a fantastic position, one block to the Gloucester Road tube station (turn right when you get out of the station, as the hotel entrance does not front Cromwell Road, but the street behind); there's a supermarket and fast food shops, as well as other shops nearby and opposite the station. It's a busy station, but good for all London attractions, and close to museums and shopping up the road (Harrods). There's also a small shop in the hotel as well for emergency purchases.Check in was quick and efficient. We had a twin room on the 17th floor - it was a great room, with a great view. On the small side, but in good condition. The shower pressure was low or gentle, depending on your point of view, and the TV occasionally turned itself off, but everything else was fine, although they might want to get a couple of Australian electricity adaptors for those like me who forget their own (European and US adapators are built into the wall sockets.)The staff were all friendly and helpful. We had room service the night we arrived, and it was good quality, and arrived quickly. Breakfast in the Forum Room was good, although occasionally supplies (eg bread for toast, milk) ran out on the buffet. They were quickly replaced though, so no problems. There is sometimes a queue at peak times which moves quickly, and staff were handing out free glasses of orange juice to those waiting, which was a nice touch. We had a fire alarm and evacuation the first night we were there, right in the middle of a pay movie. The evacuation was a false alarm, but the hotel emptied calmly and quickly - quite a sight seeing all those people swarming across London streets at 10.30pm at night though! When I checked out, I mentioned the movie clash with the fire alarm, and they immediately took the cost off my bill. A nice goodwill touch.This is a big hotel, full of tourists from all over and yes, some aircrew, and breakfast is busy, so if you prefer quiet, it's probably not your hotel. But it's great value for money, great location, pleasant staff, good food, and we'll be staying there again."
362,828,"Apr 18 2006	Will return very happy and good value	This hotel, well reviewed by many others, more than met our satisfaction and requirements. As many others have said it is easy to locate being handy to the underground and on a direct line from Heathrow. The front entrance is not on Cromwell road but down the small side road (Ashburn Gardens I think it is called). We arrived there very early due to an overnight flight and the hotel was inflexible about any chance of any early check in before 1400 hours. However the luggage storage facilities are extremely efficient and well managed. We also used their excellent wash rooms on the mezzanine floor before setting off to explore London - any easy walk, flat to many interesting shops, museums etc along the road.We were delighted with our room on the 19th floor with a view to the West over London. It was quiet, spacious and had a comfortable queen sized bed. The shower was over the bath tub and water pressure was excellent. There were no toiletries (did not bother us as we bring our own). We did not eat in the hotel at all so cannot comment on their restaurants.We thought this modern, efficient hotel was excellent value for such a great location in the heart of London. When we returned to London two weeks later when we choose to stay (with regret) in an older hotel in Belgravia. We would definitely stay at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum again."
363,828,"Apr 17 2006	decent hotel for the money	We stayed here over our spring break this year. Located very near the Gloucester Road Underground station, it was easy to get to from Heathrow, and very easy to get anywhere we wished in a few minutes. The room was small, the beds were hard, but a great value for the price we paid. The bathroom was more than we expected for an English hotel. Only real complaint is that the concierge was tremendously rude and sarcastic and of very little help. I needed help dialing a relative with a local phone number, and he was not able or willing to help with this. The desk help did not speak English well enough to answer many of our questions . . . odd for a Holiday Inn in an English-speaking country! Still, we paid very little for the two rooms, and had a great time! Excellent Pattisserie around the corner with very friendly and fun staff who provided all of the help our concierge would not."
364,828,"Apr 15 2006	Great location; great breakfast; bathrooms tiny	Arrived at 2.30 but room not ready until 3.15pm. Staff apologetic but no comfort when you're tired and just want to get rid of your baggage. Room on 18th floor comfortable, clean and bed very comfortable. However, bathroom was so tiny it would have given a claustrophobic some problems! Breakfast was supposed to be served until 10am but plenty of guests were arriving way past this time and didnt seem to cause any problems to the very friendly waiting staff. The location of the hotel is, as stated earlier, absolutely fine and well within walking distance of the V&amp;A, Natural History Museum, Science Museum and Hyde Park. We had booked a deal through Superbreaks and got our room and full breakfast for 3 nights, together with tickets to The Blue Man Group for a total of 399 for two. Absolutely fabulous!!!One word on the Blue Man Group - GO SEE!! Brilliant, especially after having a couple of glasses of Sauvignon Blanc!!As a pre-theatre dinner, couldnt fault Le Deuxieme which is approximately 3 minutes walk away from the New London Theatre. Super dinner and attentive service."
365,828,"Apr 11 2006	Excellent value 	My niece and I stayed at the Forum for three nights at the end of March. We got there very early, so no non-smoking rooms were available, but the luggage room was convenient. When we came back at 3:00 our room was ready. It was very clean, with comfortable beds and a large bathroom (with great water pressure). While the room is small (what does one expect for less than $200/night in London?), it had everything we needed, including a high powered blow dryer. I'd stayed there before, years ago, before the Holiday Inn took over, and I'd stay there again. The location can't be beat -- a two-minute walk from the Gloucester Road tube stop."
366,828,Apr 10 2006	absolutely tiny rooms	i booked this hotel based on the reviews on this website. i have travelled the world and stayed in many hotels and was shocked by the size of the bedrooms. it was a twin room and was barely big enough for one person. the bathroom was so small that it had a sliding door as there wasnt enough room to open a door. hardly anyone spoke good english and the movies/games etc didn't work in the room. we complained and told it was being fixed. i am still waiting as they were not fixed when i checked out. For a four star i was really disappointed. while its near the tube and bus stop its still quite a distance to the city. would not stay here again.
367,828,Apr 5 2006	Great Value	Got a great deal through Superbreaks for a two night stay with full English breakfast. Asked for an upper room with a view if poss and got room on 20th floor with views of Big Ben and the Eye etc. Breakfast was great with a lot of choice and all staff were very helpful. Great location-close to a tube station with a 24 hour Tesco metro nearby (has a beer/wine chiller section if you want to BYO to take to the hotel). The museums are close by and the area is very green and felt very safe.
368,828,"Mar 31 2006	American comfort with bargain prices.	I stayed here with my 82-year-old mother, who can be very particular. Room was clean, comfortable, modern. Hotel is very busy with both tourists and airline personel, but rooms are quiet. There is a convenient Waitrose Super Market next door, as well as a Boots (drug store). The tube and bus stops are very nearby, and taxis are waiting at the door. We ate at the restaurant often because mother has trouble walking far. Food was OK, service very haphazard. Mother was very pleased with the location and convenience. One problem - most of the staff speak English as a 2nd language, and some of them are not very good at it. A MAJOR problem with my bill could not be resolved because staffer couldn't communicate or understand! Not to worry - Holiday Inn International solved the problem when I returned home. I do highly reccomend this place! GREAT location and bargain internet price!!!!"
369,828,"Mar 28 2006	great location tiny rooms	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights recently(march 23,24). It is in a great location. 1 or 2 blocks to the tube, museums, harrods, and all kinds of shops and restaurants easily within walking distance. The hotel is very tall which is good if you can get a room high up. We got the 19th floor and had a wonderful view. The bad news has only to do with the rooms themselves. They are small! I mean it was seriously hard to find ground space for our two suitcases. It was also very warm inside even though the thermostat was on the lowest setting and it was only about 45 degrees outside. I recommend this hotel if you won't be in your room too much and you want to explore the wonderful area of kensington and surrounding areas."
370,828,"Mar 21 2006 	Good Hotel	I have been staying at this hotel on and off for over a year now and would rate it highly. It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run/walk in summer, near Kensington High street, rooms are always clean and have recently been refurbed, room service menu is better than other hotel chains, breakfast is good. The only thing they could improve is the gym which is small compared to the size of hotel. Stay here in confidence - no complaints."
371,828,"Mar 4 2006	Very pleasant stay	Just returned from an overnight stay at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum cannot fault this hotel, very comfortable room and pleasant staff good breakfast.Booked through Superbreaks and got a really good deal."
372,828,"Feb 28 2006	Yet another great stay!	This is the second time I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum. The rooms are a standard European size (small) but they are kept spotlessly clean and the hotel couldn't be in a better location. It was incredibly busy while we were there but the walls are so well insulated we would have never known how full it was until we went down to the lobby. There are cabs waiting there at all times, which is quite helpful if you have a very early or late flight out. If you take the tube from Heathrow Airport, it is one tube ride with no change of lines. It couldn't be easier to get there and is right in the middle of a fantastic neighborhood which is within walking distance to the Natural History Musuem, Victoria and Albert Museum and Harrods. We did a bit more exploring of the neighborhood and found some fantasic restaurants. I will certainly stay there every time I go to London."
373,828,"Feb 28 2006	Good modern hotel	Had an overnight stay at the Kensington Forum. We have stayed there previously and it was again up to standard. Our room on the third floor was too near the road and a little noisy. The hotel is efficient and check in and check out were clockwork. Parking is a little steep at 25 a night but it is central London. Breakfast was fine, big choice and well cooked. We walked straight in but 30 minutes later the queue was huge. Room was pleasantly furnished and clean. As a previous reviewer states, it is popular with airline staff and has a cosmopolitan feel. One criticism is the prices in the bar. The bar is pleasant and like a typical pub but a bottle of cheap rose plonk weighed in at 15.95p - over the top as we weren't even eating. We normally stay across the road at the Millennium Gloucester and book a Club Room. There is little difference in the price and when we return to London in three weeks I have booked the Millennium in preference to the Forum. All in all a pleasant overnight stay in a good quality modern hotel."
374,828,"Feb 15 2006	All the Worlds a Stage here !	My wife and I stayed at this hotel between Feb 11 and 14th on a Full English breakfast rate. We enjoyed our stay very much. The Kensington Holiday Inn Forum is a busy bustling hotel - and must not be confused with the much smaller HOLIDAY INN across the road ,opposite Gloucester Road Underground Station ! Our room on the 18th floor overlooked Central London. Sadly the weather was not at its best to give clear views but at night it was possible to make out the London Eye - well worth a trip on this !! - Big Ben Clock Tower, and St. Pauls Cathedral. The room was kept scrupulously clean and tidy by the cheerful staff. But one criticism was that the lavatory flush was inefficient. You had to press the central knob vigourously, sometimes twice or three times to clear everything. Frustrating, when you might be in a hurry to go out.Breakfast was served on the first floor. You had to queue and present your check in card which showed what type of breakfast you were entitled to. You were given a coloured token indicating the designated breakfast which you had to show on your table - no cheating therefore !! The range of food available would have satirfied anyone, all well cooked and efficiently replenished. The staff worked hard to clear the tables - with 1000 breakfasts to handel each morning this was no mean feat.But why was the Japanese section not labelled in Japanese script !?All the world seemed to be present. It was like being 'abroad' in London ! On Saturday evening a wonderful display of West Indian bling was on show as couples attended the twice weekly jazz session.We also noticed that airline staff stayed here: always a good sign.Outside taxis were always available whilst the Left Luggage staff were efficient in storing luggage (free).We had one evening meal in the ground floor restaurant, well cooked again, but the service was very slow. Only one chef appeared to be on duty at 6 pm. With less than 12 customers present it took more than 35 minutes to be served. So ensure you arrive well before you want to leave for your evening show !Would we stay here again ? Yes. For $400 for three nights it was good value for your money."
375,828,"Jan 21 2006	Excellant Hotel	Just got back from a two day break here (Thurs -Sat). It was my first time in London and couldn't have picked a better hotel! We booked through (-), and it was only 79 per night room rate.Its situated right around the corner from Gloucester Road tube station (on the central line). Hotel lobby is very impressive and I was immediately dealt with by probably the most helpful and efficient staff I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.The rooms are great - exactly what you would expect from a chain hotel - appointed excellantly and spotlessly clean.Breakfast was really good, but on Saturday the queue was huge! So either get up early or be prepared!The location of the hotel was brilliant - really nice area. As we were two women travelling on our own we didn't feel at all threatened in any of the local bars or indeed the hotel bar.The only downside I would say is that the hotel bar itself is quite expensive - we paid 9.15 for a glass of wine and a vodka and coke. Although this was about the same price as the local bars etc. it was above average for London itself.All in all I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a pleasant stay in London, in a nice area, at a good price!"
376,828,"Jan 8 2006	Perfect position	We just came back from London.We stayed in Holiday Inn Kensington Forum and I am glad that we did.I have stayed in another holiday inn hotel in London in the past but I must say that this was the best for a lot of reasons.I found a very good rate in secret hotels in ---- with continental breakfast.It was only 90 Euros per night during Christmas period.The position of the hotel is great.Just next to Gloucester Road tube station.We had a very good twin standard smoking room on the 10th floor,not very big but a have seen smaller ones,very clean with a free morning newspaper, with iron and ironboard and with a european outlet so that we could charge our mobile phones.I have read some reviews about the lifts but do not believe them.With 7 speedy lifts it is rather strange to wait for more than a few seconds.The English breakfast was not included in our rate and it costed 15 Pounds.But the continental breakfast was great and as I hate English breakfast it did not matter at all.There is also an ATM machine at the lobby of the hotel and a few taxis that always wait at the entrance of the hotel.The check in was very quick.But If you want to book a theater ticket do not do it through the hotel.I was told that they would provide you only the expensive ones and they would charge you even more.I always buy tickets in advance through ticketmaster."
377,828,"Jan 2 2006	Merely adequate	Despite the rave reviews posted by other patrons, we found this hotel to be merely adequate. Most of our complaints are related to the staff: the few times a concierge was actually at the desk, our simple questions about London were either not answered (they could not recommend a good Asian restaurant) or answered incorrectly (we were advised to go up to the top floor of the hotel for the best view of the New Years' fireworks--for those of you who don't know, the fireworks are on the Thames, so this advice was clearly and comically wrong!) The employees at the desk could not even locate the hotel on the map they supplied, let alone help us navigate the city. There was never any evidence that the maid did anything in our room other than shut off the heat each day, which was rather annoying (also, our shampoo was not replaced, and there was mold in the electric kettle when we tried to use it, which was really, really gross). Finally, the hotel did nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge--we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves. Still, if you're just looking for a cheap place to lay your head, the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is a great location...just don't plan on any &quot;extras&quot; like having your trash can emptied on a regular basis."
378,828,Dec 26 2005	Excellent	We stayed for 3 nights at the Kensington Forum and found it to be well located for sightseeing.Our room was large in size and clean and well kept.Breakfast was well organised with an excellent variety.I have already recommended this hotel to several people.An excellent base for a trip to London!
379,828,Dec 23 2005 	Love staying here!	I go to London quite frequently and I will only stay at the Holiday Inn Keningston Forum. I made the mistake of staying in other hotels. You get excellent value for money in a 4 star hotel. Gym facilities are fantastic as well as hotel amenities. It is very close to the tube for easy commuting access. I highly recommend staying here.
380,828,"Dec 10 2005 	Nice find in Kensington	I stayed here for one night in December 2005 paying 86 a night having booked through the Priority Club website. I booked a standard room but got my upgrade to an executive room.Other reviewers have mentioned that the rooms are small. I would agree that they are very compact, but fine for one person. My room was clean and well furnished, with a a comfortable 5ft bed. I was on the 5th floor (there are over 20 I believe). My only gripe about the room was that the hot water was not very hot. My room had the usual exec features of the bathrobe and slippers and as a Priority Club Platinum member, my gift was a half bottle of wine, which was just what was needed after a hard day.I didn't sample any of the food options but there are several outlets just around the hotel. I would definitely look at staying here again if in the area and the rate was right. As usual, the Holiday Inn has done the basics very well. Comfy bed, large clean towels and a nicely furnished room."
381,828,Dec 6 2005 	No rice - only noodles!	Can you believe this!? I asked if I could have rice instead of noodles in the day's 'special' - and was refused! The reason? They were too busy (There were about 15 people in the restaurant...)The cold tap in the basin in my bathroom was smeared with toothpaste which went all over your hands when you turned the tap on. And why are we bombarded with requests to view pornography every time we turn on the television set? This hotel has many good features but needs to smarten up its act if it is to impress this traveller...
382,828,"Nov 30 2005	Just got Back	Overall the trip was nice. The hotel was much better than the Thistle Victoria in which I stayed last time. I checked in early without a problem. The Gloucester road Tube is about 1 block away on the Picadilly, Circle and District lines. Very convienient to hop on the tube and head out. Cabs are usually waiting downstairs for you. Concierge was ok, though my first day the gentleman was not very helpful. And there is one blonde french girl who works the front desk who is to die for :) I'd definitely stay here again, as I frequent London quite often."
383,828,"Nov 23 2005	More than adequate	My wife and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum in September of 2004, and I found it to be an excellent value (unlike pretty much everything else in London). I think we paid something like $150 a night, which is pretty darn cheap for London nowadays. Our room was small by U.S. standards, but it had been recently refurbished (clean, modern, lots of blond wood) and the bathroom was quite nice. The location is fantastic--you're literally around the corner from the Tube station; there's a Sainsbury's supermarket right above the aforesaid Tube station (which has a hot foods counter that I wish we'd discovered earlier on in our trip--I'd much rather pay 2 pounds for some Sainsbury's chicken tikka than 10 pounds for a mediocre meal in one of London's many mediocre restaurants); and the neighborhood is stunningly beautiful (it's just down the road from the Natural History Museum and in the midst of what must be gazillion dollar homes/flats). If you can get a decent deal on the Kensington Forum, I'd certainly recommend it."
384,828,"Nov 21 2005	Another Very Pleasant Stay	Just spent 7 nights at the Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum. We have stayed here several times before. As the other comments point out, rooms are generally small, but the level of comfort is high as rooms are modern and rooms have been updated recently. We were upgraded to a suite, which provided a superior level of comfort and lots of room.Another plus is its location - convenient to the tube, museums, shops, etc.Although pricey by US standards, this hotel is moderately priced by Londond standards. We have paid more at other hotels for rooms that are shabby and uncomfortable and inconveniently located."
385,828,"Nov 10 2005	It's the location	This was our second stay stay at this hotel based on it's location. It is very convienent to the Underground, restaurants, stores, etc. I would stay here again, but the rooms have become too small for our taste. Two things to note. You no longer need a room key to access the elevator and the business center does not open until 8:00am. If you're comfortable with tight quarters this would be a good choice for most anyone."
386,828,Nov 6 2005	great location /well run	We stayed 5 nights on a b+b basis Hotel huge - 900 rooms Buffet breakfast good for a buffet This is a well run hotel with a great location for the metro  Rooms a bit on the small side but I would stay again
387,828,Oct 25 2005	Wonderful hotel	I truly enjoyed my stay in London Oct 19-24. The best part of my trip was the hotel. My room was very clean and the tube was close by. Checking in and out was quick and easy. There are plenty of restaurants and grocery stores close by. I would definitely recommend the hotel and I plan to stay here on my next visit to London.
388,828,"Oct 10 2005 	Great Hotel	Stayed at this hotel on Oct 5th 2005 for one night. Check-in was fast. Room was clean, bright. The location is also good because it is literally 150 footsteps (I counted for this review) from Gloucester Road Underground Station. Word of advise. If you are arriving via Gloucester Road Underground Station, turn right after exiting the station and right again up the street at the Baileys Hotel.Breakfast next morning was fine, but we had to wait a while for it to be served. There was a mix-up with my order. You can have any type of breakfast and as much as you like.I now have a hotel I will use again as a base in London for future visits."
389,828,"Oct 7 2005	Great Location good value	I have stayed in a few hotels in London while touring but it would be difficult to find a better location in London for the tourist class who is looking for value, efficiency and cleanliness. The tube is right around the corner, the neighborhood is clean and safe and the hotel has all the things you would expect from Holiday Inn. The included breakfeast was a plus and I noticed the wi fi folks using the free service in the lobby.The only minor complaint was the fact that the business center with its computers for those of us without laptops is only open 9-5. Hello, what tourist is in the hotel at that hour?I would and will return."
390,828,"Oct 2 2005	Lovely place convient situated	This hotel is just a two minute walk away from Gloucester Road Station from where you not only get into to the town centre (5 stops) and the South Kensington shopping and museum area (1 to 2 stops) but to Heathrow Airport (many stops) as well. The hotel was obviously newly refurbished and the room I got was very nice furnished. However, the room was not very large but one does not expect to get a large room in London. The minibar system was quite interesting as the bill is charged as soon as an item is taken out. So, you have to be careful and should only take what you indeed want to drink.The huge coffe bar in the lobby is quite nice and offers drinks and food at good prices.As I had a terrible hangover when I stayed there I can not write anything about the breakfast.Staff was very nice as they always are at Holiday Inns.Would stay there again."
391,828,"Sep 30 2005 	but. . . some problems	I have stayed at this hotel for two weeks each two times this year on business. The location and American standards (like washclothes) are nice touches. The first time (april) my stay was fine. . a few problems that were all responded to quickly. I noticed on my last stay that the quality of service was very diminished. There were a few persons at the reception that were down right rude. One man in particular who was wearing a training badge and indeed needed more training or perhaps just let go. After getting off a red-eye flight from the states, i recognize that i can be pretty sensentive, but a few of my colleuges who checked in a different day commented on this man too. I made all efforts to avoid this man and all else at reception was fine.  The biggest problem that was affecting everyone in the hotel was the elevator system. Every day it seemed a different card reader was broken. This means that you are not able to call another elevator until someone calls that elevator up because they wont operate without a card reader. it was really rediculas!! During my last stay there was an incident where a chain from a necklace disappeared. I am sure it was an accident because i left it laid out on a cloth napkin (so i could find it again) and the napkin had been taken. I found the pendant for the necklace lodged in a crack where it must have landed when the room was cleaned. Besides that the last time nothing was worth noting. This time however, My housekeeper constantly left dishes in my room that it was clear i was finished with (a dirty plate inside an icebucket) and neglected to replace the furnished glasses a few times. She would make up the bed but leave it away from the wall, like she was too lazy to shove it back in the right spot. She also took the key for the gym I had in the door a few times (once it was replaced a few days later but the other time it never was) Wierd!! My room itself was a little worn and torn--I was in a non-smoking room and my comforter had cigarette burns on it. This was never replaced, despite me reporting it. In addition, one day the bed was made up with ripped sheets!!! i dont know if my expectations are too high to expect better for 200$ a night!!! The carpet also had a bubble in it that i was constantly tripping over.Last thing. It is nice that they have wi-fi in the lobby, but it is extremly crowded there and if you dont have a computer, the business center is only open business hours (arent we at work then?) so if you have to use the computer after business hours and didnt bring your own, you have to find an internet cafe. . i really dont see why they cant open it on request?So like most places I would say most of my bad experiences are due to a few bad apples. I know i will probably stay here again and i really hope they step it up at the Forum!!!"
392,828,"Sep 28 2005	Enjoyed the HI Kensington Forum	My husband and I stayed for 4 nights and had no issues. Upon arrival, we upgraded to the executive double, which was worth it. The hotel is clean and the staff helpful and friendly. The hotel was centrally located with the Gloucester Road tube stop just a few blocks away. They have a luggage room, which is great if you are arriving early or need to leave your luggage after checking out. The only thing that was different was that you need to use your key card to access all levels in the lift and to turn on the lights/air in the room."
393,828,"Sep 25 2005	very happy	we stayed for 10 nights. Myself &amp; my husband, my elderly mother &amp; my husbands parents (3 rooms). We were on the 20th floor &amp; very happy with the rooms &amp; the service. We had an english breakfast included each day, the breakfast staff were very friendly &amp; the selection was fine.Our only problem was that my credit card was accidently charged 3 times, with the holding deposit, should have only been a swipe, which put me over my limit &amp; took me a couple of phone calls to Australia &amp; the police station (which wasted the best part of a day as we thought it was credit card fraud)to sort out the problem. The hotel apoligised &amp; refunded me the money, just something to be aware of, but could happen anywhere.We were still very happy &amp; would stay again. Great location. Friendly staff &amp; very clean."
394,828,"Sep 25 2005	Brilliant	We have just stayed in the Kensington Forum and have to say that it is the best hotel we have stayed in in London for the price. We booked using the vouchers found in the Yorkshire Post and paid 60 a night for a double room with breakfast. An amazing deal for London. The hotel is about 100 yds from th Gloucester Road tube which is on the Piccadilly line ( straight route from Kings cross).We were checked in by a friendly and efficient member of staff. The room was small but very clean and modern. It had everything we neeeded.After a short queue for breakfast we enjoyed an excellent buffet style English breakfast. Although the dining room was very busy it didnt seem like a cattle market. I cannot recommend highly enough this hotel. I have stayed in London many times and paid the full range of prices for a room. I can say that every time I have been disappointed with either the value, standards, cleanliness,service of the hotel. not this time. We will certainly be back."
395,828,"Sep 22 2005	Awsome Hotel!!!!!!!	My cousin and I (2 single girls) stayed at this hotel for a week on spring break in March of 2005. We loved it. The location was perfect, just a minute from the Gloucester Rd. tube station. We were easily able to navigate the city from this location. 98% of the concierges were perfect, always pleasant and extremely helpful. The grocery store was quite convenient for people like us with limited funds. Our room was neat, clean and an adequate size. The mattresses were a bit too soft, but everything else was just great. I would stay here again and again and always recommend it to others. This was truly an awsome experience."
396,828,"Sep 13 2005	Great Value	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for 3 nights during the third week of august 2005. Standard room was VERY clean and seemed new or newly renovated. The room was small however, and space is tight for two people. Hotel is conveniently located near the gloucester road tube stop and is in an upscale part of the city. Some of the front desk and wait staff were from continental europe. No one was rude to me, but many of the staff are cold, or distant. The best part of this hotel is it's value. London is a very expensive city. The hotel is clean, modern, and in an excellent location. Perfect for those who are visiting London on a budget."
397,828,"Sep 11 2005	Great location	Our one night stay was arranged by the cruise line so I can't comment on the price. The room was small but included all amenities. Plus, it was truly a non-smoking room, not one that had been &quot;freshened.&quot; It was our first experience with a elevator that required the room card before taking the guests to the appropriate floor.The continental breakfast was okay. But we would definitely stay again because of the hotel's location. It was so easy to get around since the Gloucester Rd. tube station was a short walk. A terrific Waitrose grocery store was across the street , a Tesco Express and Burger King nearby. The Delhi Brasserie restaurant recommended by the hotel's concierge was a short walk, the food delicious and reasonable."
398,828,"Sep 10 2005	Excellent	I just can not say enough good things about this hotel. Check in and out was a breeze. Room was a nice size,clean and modern.The staff was always friendly and helpful.Probably one of the best bargains in central London!!!!!"
399,828,"Aug 31 2005	Solid well run hotel	I stayed at the hotel for a night in August during a lay over in London. I was given a double room. As a single person, I found the room size adequate, though not spacious. For 2 peple with luggage, it would have been cramped. Aside from that, the location is great and the furnishings were modern and very comfortable. The hotel is right around the corner from a tube station, so it's convenient for travelling around the city. The food was good and the service was very good. It's a &quot;purpose built&quot; hotel, which means it doesn't suffer from the poor renovation standards you sometimes encounter in some older London hotels that used to be private homes. For the price, I'd say this is one of the best bargains going and, with the caveat about the room size, I would recommend the hotel highly."
400,828,Aug 27 2005	Absolutely Loved This Place	This was by far the best place we stayed in London. I guess the Kensington Close was next and the worst was the Grosvenor Kensington.Our room actually had enough room to turn around ..the bathroom was clean and had a few ammenities. We actually had face cloths.We arrived at noon and check in was suppose to be at 2p.m. they found a room for us right away. The consierge was very helpful. There was a huge breakfast buffet but we didn't eat there because it was somewhat expensive..if I remember correctly around 11 pounds for the continental and for the whole thing about 14 pounds ..a little high for breakfast for us. They also had a bar area and dining area directly off the lobby. There was a fitness center...everything was immaculate.Very good ..we will definitely stay there again....close to shopping and the underground ..restaurants were close and a laundromat was also close by.
401,828,"Aug 23 2005	Excellent location and service	I stayed here with my family on Aug 18-Aug 21. The location is excellent, just a short walk from the Gloucester Road tube station and in a lovely neighborhood. We arrived before the official check in time but were immediately given our rooms. Rooms were comfortable, roomy and clean. Concierge was very helpful; we didnt take the English breakfast but the downstairs bar offers croissants and Starbucks coffee and the service was very nice. The hotel seems to be the hotel of choice for flight crews passing through London; you can take that as a sign of a decent, dependable hotel that is not too (by London standards) expensive. I would not hesitate to stay here again. A very good value for the price."
402,828,"Aug 23 2005	Functional and Efficient	This is a massive hotel which caters for everyone from business people, to tour groups, to airline crew. Service was efficient but far from personal, how could it be when the place was as a large as it was! Executive room was clean and of a reasonable size, however the bathroom was one of the smallest I have ever seen. Overall an above average hotel based on location and price (GBP 45 inc tax) but not one for a romantic get-away!"
403,828,"Jul 24 2005	Nice	I really liked this hotel. This was my second trip to London and I wanted to stay in the same neighborhood but also wanted to give my wallet a rest.This was my first stay at this hotel. It met all my expectations - very clean room w/pleasing modern decor, above average housekeeping services, accomodating staff. The room was also very roomy. The hotel was also more upscale than I expected for a HOLIDAY INN. I will defintely stay here again."
404,828,"Jul 17 2005	Great hotel great location !	Got this at a great price via priceline and at first was worried about Holiday Inn- as usually don't care too much for this chain in the U.S. - this hotel, however, far exceeded my expectations - it was cleaner than all other hotels I stayed at in London, with a good size room, lovely bathroom.Location is fantastic - both on bus line and underground, with many useful stores on Gloucester Rd. The views from the higher rooms are just fantastic and the male desk person who checked me in was very nice and gave me a room on a high floor.The two things I disliked were the somewhat unfriendly German female staff (as determined by the flags on their lapels) I dealt with- very brusque and certainly not rude, but just not very helpful or friendly - referring most of my simple questions to others, and even acting like I should not be bothering them with the queries -and the smoke on the first floor due to the bar area. These were minor issues, considering how great the room was.Additionally, one other problem was that room service was very very inefficient - requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times.I don't consider these problems big deals, however, becuase the positives of this hotel were numerous and I had a great stay!"
405,828,"Jul 10 2005	Good basic hotel	This is a good basic hotel which has a terrific location. The Gloucester underground station is just around the corner and within easy walking distance. Additionally, there are numerous restaurants everywhere ranging from fast food to upscale. The hotel concierge desk is very helpful. The rooms are nice but beware the room refrigerator. The unit in my room seemed to run endlessly and was quite noisy, particularly during the early morning hours. Additionally, the refrigerators are computerized and just removing an item to look at it will automatically result in a charge to your room bill. If you don't believe me, just read the warning sticker on the inside of the refrigerator door. Check-in time is 2PM and the hotel won't bend an inch. We arrived from Heathrow at 1:50 and were forced to sit in the lobby for 10 minutes before they would give us the room."
406,828,"Jun 28 2005	Quite nice for a Holiday Inn	My partner and I stayed at Kensington Forum from June 20-23, 2005 and found it to be better than adequate. Yes, the room was smaller than we Americans are used to and expect, but was about average in size for European hotels. The room was very clean, and the beds were comfortable. I'll admit that it was a bit confusing at first to have to use the room key to turn on the lights and select a floor on the elevator, but it wasn't a big imposition - again it was just different from what Americans expect. The continental breakfast was fine - with lots of fresh pastries, dry cereals, juices, etc., and the full English breakfast buffet looked good, too. If I were inclined to huge breakfasts, I would have indulged.The least adequate aspect was the fitness center - it was smallish and didn't provide the kind of exercise equipment that a hotel of that sort should offer. The best part: The concierge - whose name was Gladstone - was great. He was very knowledgeable about restaurants, gave great advice on getting tickets for shows, gave flawless directions. We tipped him fairly handsomely because he was extraordinarily helpful.Oh - and a great location. Just a block from the Tube station."
407,828,"Jun 26 2005	Amazing location!	Stayed at the HILK (what a great acronym) for 4 days in May 2005. I'll give you a brief rundown on the pluses and minuses:Great:- checked us in at 11 am after a transatlantic flight- room larger than average, compared to our continental Europe travel- location, location, location ... just a few moments from the Gloucester Road underground station, which means super-easy access to Heathrow much of Zone One- concierge very helpful with providing directions - air-conditioned!Not-so-great:- price ... but we felt we did quite well for London at $200 CDN- phone calls ... local calls VERY expensive, even to landlinesWould I stay again? For sure, but I would work a little harder (Priceline, etc) on finding a better deal."
408,828,"Jun 21 2005	Good hotel	We really enjoyed our stay at the Kensington Forum in February. The rooms were spotless and comfortable, as were the bathrooms. The location is right next to the Picadilly line tube stop, so it is very convenient to get around town and also to the airport. There are also several restaurants and pubs nearby, as well as a shopping center and grocery store where you can by snacks and drinks. We ate the buffet breakfast several mornings and it was good - though after a few days, we were somewhat bored of it and skipped it for pastries at coffee and tea shops around town. If you want to be in the heart of London by all of the action, this is really not the place to stay. All in all, we had a nice time at this hotel."
409,828,"Jun 9 2005	Free WiFi Internet in the Lobby	I didn't stay here, but came here everyday during my stay in London. They have free wireless internet access in the lobby. (My hotel wanted to charge me 8 pounds a day.) The lobby was smoky, but the internet access was fast and free. They also have a number of power outlets available."
410,828,"Jun 9 2005	excellent stay	My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in early May. We arrived at the hotel after a long and sleepless overnight flight at 8:30 am and were relieved to find our room ready. I guess with 900+ rooms one had to be available. High up on the 19th floor great view, window that opened and more than 10 tv channels. Concierge and front desk staff were helpful with directions, tours and eatng out. No major complaints about this hotel except the cigarette smoke in the hotel pub, hard to eat a meal if your not used to smoke.Great location, grocery store open 24 hours within 5 mins walk and friendly international staff, will stay here again."
411,828,"Jun 5 2005	Great location - but executive room not worth it!	We enjoyed our trip to London - and the location for the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum was terrific. Only a couple of minute walk to the Gloucester tube, and very close to a Waitrose, Sainsburys, post office, laundromat (I mostly brought clothes for hand-washing, but my husband didn't - and for the clothes for 4 days, it was about $30.00 total to wash at landromat - London is expensive!)The staff at the hotel wasn't anything to write home about, especially after our lovely stay at the Kempinski airport hotel in Munich. We got in about 9am to the Holiday Inn, and the room wasn't ready yet (I didn't expect it to be, but I also think that because there are so few executive rooms, that is part of the reason why we didn't get into the room until closer to noon). We were on our honeymoon, and I got a good deal on Travelocity so I ended up splurging on an executive room - it sounded more pampering. I didn't care about the room size, but it said it included bathrobes, chocolate, orange juice, mineral water, etc. We paid about $45 more a night for the upgrade.The room was adequately sized - there are only two of us, so we weren't looking for much. The bathroom is small, but well equipped. However, this is what the &quot;free chocolate, orange juice, mineral water&quot; entailed: we could each have one can of orange juice out of the minibar each day. Same with a small bottle of water. And the chocolate? We could share the one kit-kat in the mini-bar, when they remembered to put one in. THIS is what should be put in their ads, because I'd never have upgraded. There was one bathrobe. Supposedly there was supposed to be a pillow menu, I never saw one. I read on their site that internet was free, but the business center was closed the first couple of days when we were there - and there were prices posted. I used the internet cafe down the street (20 minutes for a pound).I do recommend the hotel - it was clean, excellent location, there was ice on the top floor along with one microwave, etc. I'd stay there again. But I wouldn't splurge on the executive room - it isn't worth it! We could have bought a ton of chocolate, orange juice, even had a few meals for what we spent upgrading."
412,828,"Jun 4 2005	Good value	Although in the States, I would never stay in a Holiday Inn, I was pleasantly surprised with the HI Kensington Forum. Right off of the Piccadilly and Circle tube lines, the location is excellent. We got a special on American Airlines' website for $1300 for a 7 night stay. Considering the horrible exchange rate GBP/USD at the time we were in London, I believe the price was fair. The room was normal size for a European hotel and we were pleasantly surprised to have free wireless internet in the hotel lobby. Breakfast was included in the room and we utilized it each morning, as the hotel restaurant was adequate. Continental breakfast was cereal, croissants, yogurt, and fruit. There was also a more expensive English breakfast with many hot foods which was included in some room prices. All in all, if I went to London and needed a reasonably priced hotel, I would stay again. The neighborhood is residential, there is a Tesco and a Starbucks a block from the hotel, and the hotel itself was a high 3 star establishment."
413,828,"Jun 2 2005	Thinking of staying at the HIKF? Here's lots of details	Based on reviews from this site, my friend and I booked 9 nights at the HIKF (May 21-30) through Priceline. When I was researching hotels I found lots of helpful information scattered among the posts, so Im going to try to pull together the kind of information I wish I had found in one post. We flew into Gatwick and took the Gatwick Express to Victoria station, then a taxi to the hotel. It was 7.80 pounds going to the hotel from Victoria Station, but 10 pounds going back. Im pretty sure the driver took the most direct route from the hotel, so not sure why the difference in price. Traffic was not an issue either time, but the cheaper one was a Saturdayno idea if that mattered. We arrived around 9am and were able to check in immediately to room 1403. Standard room (two twin beds) with a view of the London Eye out the window. Check in was fast and efficient, and the lobby is very clean and modern. Lots of places to sit. Gift shop and concierge desk there also. We did see quite a few airline pilots/flight attendants getting off a bus coming into the hotel each morning. You need your room key to active the elevator, which is a nice security touch, but the readers in one elevator in particular (the one closest to the lobby) were very sensitive and didnt always work. Your room key is also necessary to turn on the electricity, which some people here have complained about. That was no big deal at all  you unlock the door and stick a room key in the slot just inside the door. Done! At least you never have to worry about losing your key this way! There was a small refrigerator in the room with a space marked for personal use that held about 6 cans of soda. The only annoying thing about the mini-bar is that if you jiggle any of the items already in there, they get added to your bill, although housekeeping always reversed the charges after checking the room. There is a placard there warning that if you move the items you may be charged. The frig doesnt keep items cold enough for food safety  its merely to slightly chill. The bathroom was spotless and clearly recently renovated. We had two large towels, two hand towels, and two washcloths daily. A tiny bar of bar soap is provided, but there are also dispensers of soap near the sink, and in the tub. Warning! its a big step to get into the tub and it was extremely slippery. I had to use the rubber bath mat or risk breaking my neck. Water pressure was great, and there was always plenty of hot water. There is an electrical outlet on the desk that works with U.S. appliances  a big plus! We used my friends hair dryer with no adaptor or converter necessary. The room also came with a small hair dryer tucked under the desk. There was an iron and board in the room. No safe. Very little drawer space, and the closet is small but there were plenty of hangers. Beds were comfortable, although I did request a second pillow after the first night. Instead of a top sheet theres a sheet-covered duvet/comforter, which waswell, comfortable! There are individual temperature controls in the room, which was great. The first part of our trip we had the window open but by Friday the temp was 85, and we ran the air conditioning. The view from the windows was fun (Victoria and Albert museum, with the London Eye in the distance, as I mentioned) but the windows were unfortunately extremely dirty on the outside. There was a coffee maker in the room which neither of us used. Room service will bring a bucket of ice any time, or theres a machine on the 25th floor. We were never disturbed by housekeeping  the one day I came back early and was actually in the room during the day, they didnt come until 4pm. That was a little later than I would have liked. We bought groceries from the grocery store around the corner (Waitrose) which was open until.I wanna say 9pm each night, and from 12-6 on Sunday. Mostly snacks for the room, soda, and stuff for breakfast. The apple yum-yums were particularly good. Since we did breakfast in the room each morning I cant comment on the hotels spread. We did have dinner in the restaurant the first night, which was very good, and the waiter was particularly entertaining. On two other nights we ate in the Tavern (great fish n chips), which is the bar attached to the hotel (past the elevators). The Gloucester Road tube stop is a block from the hotel. It serves the Circle, District, and Piccadilly lines, which will get you to most of the touristy things with little or no switching necessary. Across from the tube stop is a Tesso/Tesco (name?) drug store open 24 hours. Burger King and KFC are also there. Theres a cute pub with outside seating called the Stanhope Arms, and a little further down is Black and Blue (with torches outside) where we had a very nice dinner one night. Steak dinners for two people, plus a couple glasses of wine and dessert came to about 37 pounds, as I recall. If youre contemplating taking any tours with Premium Tours (we did three!), they have a pickup site at the Millennium Gloucester hotel, which is right across from the Holiday Inn. It was also the first drop off point in the evening. Much more convenient than getting ourselves to the Victoria Coach Station (which, regardless of what anyone tells you, is NOT that close to Victoria Station. Its at least 3 blocks, as we found one day when we were running to get from one to the other, so give yourself time to get there)I would stay at the HIKF again without hesitation. The neighborhood was pretty, there were good stores, it felt safe, the hotel was clean, etc."
414,828,"Jun 1 2005	Basic fare	Visited the Kensington Forum for three nights in May. Next time need to remember to turn left out of Gloucester Road Underground to avoid walking right round the hotel. Slow check in. Good security on the lift. Typical London impersonal service from staff. Excellent room with good bathroom. Fantastic view if overlooking central London. A lot of traffic noise despite double glazing seeming to be shut. Kettle overheated and had to be replaced. Nice to have an ironing board, once I'd worked out how to use the iron. TV worked except for one channel. Bed comfy. Slow checkout. Nice free paper if you like &quot;The Independant&quot;.Ate in the restaurant one evening in a function room. Food was fine."
415,828,May 1 2005	Nice place; great location	We stayed 5 nights in a room whose price was second lowest. Senior rates are quite attractive; we paid an average of $200 which included a weekend. Room size is fine and bathroom is good. Very clean hotel and pleasant desk staff. This is a block away from the Gloucester Road tube which is very nice. The neighborhood is lively with reasonable places for breakfast. I sent a friend there and he and his wife were happy.This was our second stay. It is a good value for London. Just wish I could say the same about restaurant prices. They are less attractive than New York's.
416,828,"Apr 3 2005	Great location nice hotel	I used this site and decided to stay at Holiday Inn Kensington Forum. I was not disappointed with the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 9 a.m. and got the room right away even though the check in time is at 2 p.m. It is a relatively new hotel, clean and has a great location which is close to the underground with 3 connecting lines, it gives you an advantage to go anywhere without changing lots of trains. Three of us stayed in the executive room, it was a little bit crowded though but not as horrible as previous post declared. I guess it depends on how spoiled or demanding you are. I think it is a good idea that you have to use your room card to get the elevator moving, it is just a security issue.There are lots of stores and restaurants in the area as well. I would defenetly return to London and stay here again."
417,828,"Mar 30 2005	We were not impressed	We were so unimpressed with this hotel, we cut our two night trip short and only stayed one. On arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a very friendly valet who parked our car for us (at a charge) and we were able to leave our luggage as we were early and the room was not ready. When we arrived back to check in, we noticed that the main lobby was full of business people on laptops along with lots of flight attendants ( this seems to be hotel used by Quantas Airlines for its staff on stopovers) and that it was very smoky! Not nice! We made our way to the room and a real pain is the fact that every time you use the lift you have to put your key card in before the button will work. On opening the door to the room we had a real disappointment. I had read other reviews and was under the impression that the room would be quite adequate. How wrong could I have been? It was TINY. The sofa was huge and had not been made up for our daughter. The maid did eventually come in and make the bed (it was quite an awkward situation with the three of us and the maid in such a cramped space) but what was most astounding was the fact that when the bed was out, there was no space between that and the drawers to get to the bathroom. In other words, if you need the bathroom in the night you would literally have to clamber over a double sofa bed - surely a safety hazard. Thankfully the bed does retract fully back into the sofa even when it has been made up with the sheets and duvets so we didn't get it out at night until the last possible minute. Other bad points - smelly pillows, stained bedspread (not duvets on main bed only a sheet and old blanket), one tiny wardrobe and noise at night. Every time the people in the room next door went in their wardrobe, it sounded like they were in ours! We were repeatedly woken in the night by people talking in rooms around us too. Good points - clean bathrooms although after a refurb you wouldn't expect anything less. Fantastic location right next to Gloucester Rd tube station. Don't stay here if you want some comfort. We had to double check at reception that we really were staying in an 'executive' room. We were informed that standard rooms were even smaller! Heaven help the poor souls that stayed in those!"
418,828,"Mar 25 2005	Best value for the dollar	I was fortunate to get the Holiday Inn London Forum on my last two visits to London (Jan 10-17 and March 14-22) for a bid of $74. The beds are comfortable. The room was immaculate. The staff was helpful. You will hear the trains if you have a NW facing room. I was in 1706. Rooms facing SW are very quiet. The location is superb. Two busses, and the tube right there.The Waitrose Market sells yummy food. We made salads most nights. The room had a refrigerator.I certainly hope to be fortunate to stay there again."
419,828,"Mar 4 2005	My #1 good value hotel anywhere in the World	face it, London is very expensive, and rooms are not up to US standards ( even in luxury hotels)This hotel is PERFECT for the American that wants a clean, comfortable, reliable room without spending a fortune.I want close proximity to tube station, starbucks, and food. I want a clean modern room with a minibar.This place fits the Bill.I travel to London once or twice a year, and for the past 2 years have been staying here. I love this hotel.It is not the ritz, but the value for the money makes this my #1 value for money hotel in the world"
420,828,"Feb 11 2005	Excellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum.	We booked our hotel through priceline.com and we were shocked at the value, we paid $80/ night when all was said and done. We were willing to pay $120 (keep in mind we are cheap). In September/October 2004.  We arrived at the hotel at 8:30 in the morning, well before check-in. People were conversing in the clean, modern, lobby drinking their morning tea or coffee, reading their papers, my husband and I agreed that we would not mind waiting there for the room.   However, much to our surprise the front desk clerks took our credit card and immediately gave us our requested non-smoking room. When we stepped into the room it was an even greater relief, on the 17th floor we had a wonderful view of Earls Court and some Georgian architecture, our favorite visual was an advertisement against smoking, in which there was a cigarette half un-wrapped with what appeared to be a fatty clogged artery inside.   Our room smelled fresh and clean the beds were comfortable- which is a lot coming from me as I have a spine condition. The bathroom was BRANDNEW and so clean that I even bathed in the tub, which ordinarily I would not do at a hotel. The cleaning people came daily and changed our sheets and towels each day, which is AMAZING for London standards.   I wish I could remember our waiters name, but he was superb always letting me stop by and grab creamer, napkins, and plastic ware as long as I promised to bring back the plates and creamer on my way back out of the hotel. We were on a tight budget and he understood when I was making breakfast and dinner in the hotel room.    We also booked our shuttle to the airport through the hotel. The conceirge was nice and helpful. However, DO NOT BOOK THEATRE TICKETS AT THIS HOTEL, (unless you have money to throw away) they were 2X as much as TKTS, the best deal is at the TKTS booth at Leicester Square do not be afraid of the line, it goes quickly, and even if it doesn't it is well worth the wait!  I would recommend Holiday Inn Kensington Forum to my grandparents, parents, nephews and nieces, and my friends in a heartbeat."
421,828,"Jan 28 2005	Delighted with the HIKF	My husband and I spent weekend in late January in the HIKF. Little apprehensive on arrival as our phone booking had not 100% guaranteed non-smoking, double bed preference. However we need have had no fears we checked in at about midday, preferences accomodated, showered after our flight and took off sight-seeing. Room was cleaned with fresh towels etc upon our return later that afternoon. Room was small but perfectly kitted out - spotless with thoughtful facilities like retractable clothes line over the bath , mini-bar, hair-dryer etc. Breakfast was included in our room rate - and it was a great feast - lots of fresh fruit, interesting sausages, Japanese breakfast option - and the big dining room had a nice buzzy holiday feel to it.Check out the brilliant view from the big windows at the fire escape on the 26th floor. All in all great location - nice restaurants nearby, nicely pitched service. As reliable as you would expect from a Holiday Inn - we'll be back."
422,828,"Jan 20 2005	Great for the value	I too got this for the $70/night range from Priceline. Even though this price doesn't include breakfast it was still a great value. We had a double bed with a large room (by London standards). No problems with the bathroom. I agree that you should skip using the hotel for meals but that isn't a problem. Right by the Gloucester Road tube you can find plenty of sit downs and takeaways for meal options -- breakfast, lunch or dinner. Speaking of the tube, the location really is great 1 block away!Also within a block or two are a launderette (don't use the hotel or you'll get reemed), internet cafe as well as a Sainsbury supermarket or Tesco Xpress mini mart. I definitely would stay here again.Plus the tavern was a good deal if you wanted a pint or two I highly recommend going during their happy hour. Yes it's a hotel pub but it seemed to have a decent mix of hotel guests plus locals."
423,828,"Jan 17 2005	Great Facility... too bad Bad Service	Just stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum (Jan. 6 through 13). The facility was great for what I ended up paying on Priceline. The location of the hotel is excellent. Only a block away from the tube stop - though you can sort of hear one of the tube lines (even with the windows closed).What brings down my rating for the hotel is their service. I still can't figure out if it's a difference in &quot;service&quot; from US and UK standards or if it's just this hotel. Our first room had an unbearable odor from an unflushed toilet which made me think, &quot;Who else is using the room when guests are not using them.&quot; Of course we got a different room (4 hours later), but why wasn't it cleaned before?? My experiences with the concierge desk made me wonder why they even offer it. Even a simple question of what the weather is like elicit a guess of their conversion from celcius to farenheit. He was off by at least 25-degrees.Overall, it was a great value for my money. I would definitely stay there again - should it come up again in Priceline. I would do more on my own and limit what I ask them to do (e.g., extra towels, looking up time tables for train schedules, etc.). I would stay away from being put up on the 25th floor as it has a lingering odor from all the microwaving people do up there. Avoid purchasing anything from the hotel as it caters to business travelers and charge an arm-and-a-leg for everything including breakfast."
424,828,"Jan 15 2005	Well located and helpful	A friend and I stayed at the hotel in late December. We booked a package through &quot;Cheap Tickets.&quot; Like others, I liked the location with restaurants, Glouster tube station, small grocery stores---and internet cafes within easy walking distance. The Kensington Forum is about as close to an American style hotel as one can reasonably hope to find in London at a reasonable price. I had no problems concerning the rooms, or staff. Food was expensive, but that is true all over London just now.We were booked from December 27 to January 2, but a near diaster struck. I was unfortunate and foolish enough to have my passport, ID, and credit card stolen on the tube on Dec. 31. Nothing could be done about the passport until January 4, when the American Embassy reopened after the long New Year's weekend. The hotel was very helpful and booked us for three more nights in the same room at the lowest rate that they could (lower than we had reason to expect). The gentlemen at the concierge desk were very helpful and considerate, helping me to find necessary phone numbers to call and placing a number of the calls themselves. They did an excellent job.If I return to London, I will stay at the Holiday Inn London Kensington."
425,828,"Dec 28 2004	Will recommend it to friends - great place!	We stayed at the Holiday Inn from Dec. 9-13, paid USD 75,-- / room through priceline. Nice staff at check in, priceline not mentioned, we received standard rooms with twin beds - kings size beds are not available in standard rooms (that's what they said at check-in). Everything was nice and clean. Good concierge service - recommended very good restaurants - italian and indian - to us - in walking distance from the hotel.The location of the hotel is excellent - one block from the tube Gloucester Rd and the surrounding neighborhood is fantastic - take a walk from High Street Kensington to the hotel - I'd love to live there!"
426,828,"Dec 24 2004	Great Hotel Great Location Great Value!	The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum in London is wonderful. The hotel staff are very helpful and provided excellent service. I only paid $70 USD per night for this hotel per priceline. The rate did not include breakfast. We arrived at 8:30 A.M. and were allowed to check in. The rooms are small but well equipped. Two twin beds, a sitting chair, desk, minibar, etc. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms spotless. The shower was small but had a very strong water pressure. The only thing we can really complain about were the cold drafts on the floor at night and the limited selection of channels on the TV. I would stay here again, no questions asked. It is a wonderful hotel."
427,828,"Dec 23 2004	Location Location Location	My wife and I spent five nights here, ending December 22, 2004. This was our second stay. The biggest advantage of this hotel is it's excellent location just off of Gloucester Road in Kensington, with the Undergroud one block away, along with several nice restaurants and pubs in the area. We found the hotel rooms to be very clean, especially the recently refurbished bathrooms. Our double bed was, however, not as comfortable as those in other hotels; they were stiff with little cushioning. As noted in other reviews, the Continental Breakfast is not wonderful, and if possible, one should upgrade to the full English Breakfast. The lobby always smells of cigarette smoke due to the high volume of people checking in or out. Bottom line: British Airways always has very attractive packages including this hotel and it is a value. We paid about $122.00 per night."
428,828,"Dec 22 2004	Comfortable hotel excellent value	Just returned from 5 nights at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum, booked through British Airways for $110/night including all taxes and continental breakfast each morning. At that price, the hotel is a terrific value. It's not the Ritz, but it's a very comfortable and pleasant hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The hotel is spotlessly clean and all of the staff were very helpful. Although the location is a bit removed from the West End, it is only a block away from the Gloucester Road underground, with three train lines that will take you almost anywhere in the city in 15 minutes or less. Very convenient. In general, decor is uninspired and the hotel lobby with its pink &amp; gray granite floor looks a bit like a 1950's bank lobby. The guest rooms (all recently renovated) are quite pleasant, and my room on the 15th floor had a nice view of the city. The room was fairly large by London standards, but storage space (closet/drawers) was minimal. The bathroom was the smallest I've ever seen, but did include a full-size tub/shower combination. My only real complaint was the king-size bed, which was a bit too firm for my taste."
429,828,"Dec 9 2004	great location good but large tourist hotel	Just stayed there over Thanksgiving week. The location is great and very convenient. Easy access to the Undergroud (Gloucester Rd.). There are a number of restaurants in the neighborhood. Also there is a free ATM in the Post Office on the corner of Cromwell and Gloucester. The Waitrose supermarket has many take out food options. As a woman travelling alone, I also found the area to be very safe. A couple of nights I came home on the underground between 10 and 11 at night and felt completely safe walking the 2 blocks to the hotel.The hotel clean and well maintained but it is a large tourist hotel (25 floors) so it is fairly impersonal. The employees were efficient and pleasant but nothing outstanding. The rooms were clean but not large. But I am not looking for much assistance from a hotel (it is a place to sleep). Like another review, I did experience the concierge employees sitting in comfortable chairs chatting with each other in the early morning hours and not bothering to get up when I appeared. Also the lobby restaurant/lounge allowed smoking so the lobby (and elevators) smelled of smoke, particularly in the morning hours. Also the lobby in the morning (around 9 am) was generally wall to wall tourists waiting for tour buses and guest checking in and out (do not try &amp; get information at this time of the day).I like the convenience of breakfast in my hotel and continental breakfast was included with my room. I upgraded to English breakfast most days (another 4 pounds). The English breakfast besides having eggs, meat, mushrooms &amp; baked beans also had better fruit than was generally available with the continental breakfast. It is fairly costly for what you get but you trade off the convenience. It was also not easy for the help to understand that I wanted my own pot of tea with tea bags. If you did not specifically ask, you will get prebrewed weak tea.The location is great but there are many hotels in the same area so I might try out others but would certainly consider coming back."
430,828,"Dec 7 2004	Small - but quite pleasant!	I've been to London several times. Each time I try to stay in a different area. It affords me greater visibility.This time I, along with family, selected this hotel an air and hotel combo from Priceline. For what it cost the three of us over the Thanksgiving holiday I couldn't have made a better selection. The location was perfect. The Gloucester Tube and the #74 bus were a block away. The tube supported access to three train lines and we came into London from Heathrow Airport using the Piccadilly Line.The hotel was easy to find , the Kensington ambiance delightful and the hotel check-in a joy. The room was small by American standards but comfortably furnished, all new infact, a pull out sofa the size of a love seat and two twin beds. The bathroom was also new and beautifully tiled. There were liquid soap dispensers attached to the wall in the shower and next to the sink. You had a choice of LUX or DOVE soap.However, I think when you state in an ad that the hotel has cable one would expect more than MTV and Cartoon Network. My other peeve is having the housekeeping staff knock on your door at 8:30 am wanting access. If you had not already planned to rise early their noisy work habits would inspire you.Having said that-- there is no doubt in my mind that I'd stay here again.Perhaps on my next trip the US dollar will yield a better rate of return than US $1.80 for 1 GBP."
431,828,"Dec 3 2004	Will definately return.	Just returned after a 9 night stay. Rooms are a bit small but the modern decor and cleanliness more than made up for it. Agreed with all the other **** and ***** reviews. We experienced a small problem with check in, but the next day a bowl of fresh fruit was left in the room from management.Another reviewer mentioned the smell of food on the 25th floor. Room 2519 is where the only ice machine and a microwave are located. Very convenient, but don't stay on that floor as the smell of heating food wafts down the corridor. Our experience with staff was excellent, from the front desk to the dining room. For an amazing (and v.expensive) dining experience, try the 1880 at the Bentley, only one block away."
432,828,"Nov 25 2004	Absolutely loved it!	Can't beat the location, rooms, value and view! This was my second trip to London and after staying at a value hotel in Earl's Court the first time, this place was superior in every way. We selected it because of other reviews and would definitely come back here again! The best kept secret here is the fact that there is a standard US electrical outlet in every room. This was wonderful for recharging our digital cameras, using our own hair dryers and electric shavers! The best food deal in this area is the local grocery store down the street - get your breakfast and lunch here and dine out nightly. Anyone who wants a cheap London breakfast or lunch forget it."
433,828,"Nov 20 2004	Good Value Nice Hotel Fantastic Location	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for two nights November 10-12 2004, and at the Crowne Plaza St. James a week later, also for two nights. Overall, I would choose the HIKF over the CPlaza.Holiday Inn KF has a location that cannot be beat. One block from the tube, half a block from a nice grocery store for essentials like bottled water, snacks and takeaway prepared food, tissues, etc. The restaurants in the area aren't fabulous, but we weren't there for fine dining. VandA, Science and Natural History Museums all less than 10 min. walk.Room was a twin (two single beds). Small, but highly efficient, brand-new looking, and spotless. Bath also small, but white, chrome and gleaming. No problems with hot water on demand, and the best flush in Europe. I especially appreciated the electricity conservation program: when you enter the room you place your room cardkey in a slot on the left side wall. This activates the electricity for the room, and the lights can then be turned on. When you leave, you take the cardkey out and the lights, tv, etc. are automatically shut off after about 30 seconds, giving you ample time to leave the room. As a conservationist, I applaud HIKF for using this method to save energy.We were treated with courtesy during our stay, not ever feeling like &quot;second class&quot; visitors because we'd booked with Priceline. We used room service one night and it was excellent. (The steak sandwich with caramelized onions was really very good.) Food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered.The only drawbacks were the elderly concierges who were on duty early in the morning. They were not helpful in securing taxis and seemed more interested in their own conversation than in servicing the guests. Also, the cash machine in the lobby is not connected with the Cirrus network, or any other that is commonly used in the United States, so your ATM card probably wouldn't work there. It is one of those commercial type machines that charge hefty fees for withdrawing cash. We hadn't used the machine before, and I was not able to get cash out for the taxi to Victoria Station (we had a Eurostar to catch). I asked the concierge on duty to please call a taxi so that I could then pay with my credit or debit card, and he actually refused to do so. (I lodged a complaint with Holiday Inn--haven't heard anything yet.) We had to struggle down the street with all our belongings and find a bank ATM, withdraw money and then hail a cab on the street, barely making our connection to Paris. Other than those lazy and unhelpful employees, however, I found the hotel to be quite modern in a Jetson's kind of way, very clean, and wonderfully situated. At $75 a night, it was the best value of our stay and the next time we go to London we would certainly stay here again."
434,828,"Nov 18 2004	Is this the same hotel?	I do wonder whether I stayed at the same hotel as the other reviewers. My mother and I have just arrived back after a six night stay. Check in was a bit of a disaster as the receptionist asked if we wanted a Queen or two double beds. We replied two beds. (My name is not Oedipus!) We then went to our room on the second floor and discovered a Queen bed. Back down to reception. We were then assigned to the fourteenth floor. I was given the key card to 1417 while my mother was taken with the luggage to 1427. That was quickly sorted. The standard room was somewhat cramped and there was mold under the rubber mat for the shower. Next morning, breakfast and when asked our room, we replied 1417 but that indicated another resident. (I think their records showed we were still in 1427!) The breakfast was fairly good and included cold meats which was a pleasant surprise for a continental breakfast. One server was truly excellent throughout our stay.Next day, my mother tried her card to enter the room and it did not open the door. We then went down to reception and had to provide a description of the contents of our room while the Manager on duty then inspected the room to ascertain that it was ours.One evening the telephone indicated that a message was waiting for us and when I pushed the button on the telephone to retrieve it I was unsuccessful. I then telephoned to arrange a wake up call and found out from the Operator that one had to press a four digit code but there was no indication of that on our telephone.The hotel is close to the Underground station and one has the availability of three different lines which is a bonus.The portions at the hotel's own Cromwell Pub were generous."
435,828,"Nov 15 2004	awesome everything free wireless	could not have been happier with the hotel. free wireless in lobby, 10 pounds per day for wireless in the room. this is definitely the location you want. I think 3 different lines stop here, so you can take a direct train anywhere. the tube stop is a block away. get bottled water at the 24-hour store next to the tube stop."
436,828,"Nov 11 2004	Great location loved the hotel	I just returned from London with my daughter and we were delighted with the Kensington Forum. The rooms were very clean and the bathroom was good for a London hotel. Although small, we had twin beds and the coffee/tea making facilities were great to come back too. I am from England and do not like to spend a lot of money in restaurants and I was delighted to find lots of take-out, groceries etc, right by the hotel. The tube station is right there and the location is great for getting around London. The continental breakfast which was included in the price was very nice and served in the dining room, a pleasant time before dashing off around the city. The service was great with lots of coffee and tea and toast brought to the table for you. I will definately return to this hotel again and highly recommend it for the discerning visitor."
437,828,"Nov 9 2004	Great hotel great location	We stayed in the Kensington Forum for 5 nights in October 2004. It was terrific. The room was large for a London hotel with a great bathroom - nice tub and great shower. The hotel is conveniently located next to a tube stop (Gloucester Road) and there are also a number of restaurants in the area. In addition, there is a grocery store close by and a 24 hour shop for sodas and snacks. You could not beat the location or the price. We booked through priceline and got the room for $70 US per night which was a steal!The hotel had a concierge that could get tickets to shows, arrange tours, rent cars or provide simple directions. There is a laundromat nearby and there is a shop in the hotel for daily newspapers. The hotel has a bar, a restaurant, and a cafe with tea, coffee and muffins, etc. There is also a Starbucks and a pastry shop nearby for your morning breakfast if you don't want to spend the money for the hotel breakfast. There are also hotel extras like a choice of pillows!We could not have been happier with the Forum!"
438,828,"Nov 4 2004	great hotel in great hotel	After some bad experiences with hotels in london, I would definitely stay here again.The room is quite large, very clean with beautiful view over London. The price is moderate for the service and the location."
439,828,"Nov 2 2004	Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum	The Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum is an excellent hotel except for the fact that they have a few problems.I booked my trip as a package deal that was to include as their online information stated &quot;A continental breakfast&quot; free each day. Their info also stated they had &quot;cable TV&quot;.Well, upon checkin, I was told no room was available as &quot;they had been full the night before&quot; so I would have to wait. This was after a flight that included a layover, so I had been awake close to 24 hours. I settled down in the lobby for at least 2 hours.After no word from them I finally inquired as to when I would be able to receive a room. I had requested a room on a non smoking floor, but ended up having to take a room on a smoking floor that was on the end of a hall. What happened is the room was near where the maids came and went so you were always hearing thumps of doors opening and slamming, plus whoever occupied the room next to me was always coming and going well into the night.I was informed upon checkin that the &quot;free continental breakfast&quot; that was quoted was not free, due to &quot;the deal I had gotten&quot;. The &quot;deal&quot; cost me close to $1000 for my stay. The cable tv turned out to be 17 channels, four of which were in german, french, japanese, and arabic. The only true cable channels were MTV and Cartoon network, plus Sky news. This was also on satellite, so as the weather came and went, the signal would disappear. The in room bar was extremely expensive if used. 4 pounds for a coke ($2).The food in their pub as far as sandwiches etc, was reasonable. However, the continental breakfast cost 11.95 (roughly $22 in american dollars) for cereal, bread, thinly sliced meats and fruit. Their online info also stated they had computers with internet access, which was only partially true. They had two computers in a business center that was closed most of the time.I will say this hotel is in a wonderful location, right across from the gloucester tube station and only a stop or two away from Notting hill, Harrods, and Kensington High street.There are plenty of eating places also in the same couple of blocks that are far more reasonable than the hotel. They have a KFC, Burger King and several very nice restaurants where you can get a FULL english breakfast for 4.95. There is also an internet cafe that is brilliant, with over 30 computers and internet at a cost of only .50 pence per half hour. There is also a grocery store in the arcade next to the tube station.I am giving the hotel an okay rating because of the above problems, plus the beds have only a comforter and a stiff, hard feeling duvet on them. Staff is above average in wanting to help, but as I said, the hotel does not match their online brochure promises. Also, the inroom movies that are indicated to be part of the package cost 8 pounds ninety five PER view, and the playstation games 5 pounds ninety five per view.Overall, I am going to try another hotel in the vicinity on my next trip."
440,828,Nov 2 2004	Location	We stayed at this place for 5 nights. I think we got a good deal through british airways holidays at 100 pounds a night.. The hotel is bright and busy with a good front office and concierge. The breakfast was awesome. We stayed in a triple room which was supposed to be the biggest they had. It was small but very comfortable. I was amazed to see the knid of features you could pack into such a tiny bathroom. THE best part of the hotel is that it was spotless clean and we found the same trait in all hotels we stayed in whether it was holiday inn or holiday inn express.The hotel is very very close to the Gloucester Road tube station and also has a 24 hr grocery store close by . We actually bought an all day travel card from the airport and took the picadilly line tube. We got off at Gloucester Road and pulled all our luggage to the hotel . So we saved atleast 40 pounds on taxi that day.I think we truly enjoyed our stay in London and a lot of it was due to Holiday Inn
441,828,"Oct 30 2004	Holiday Inn Forum	Oct24,2004 Third stay at this hotel in three months.Location is so convienent to the tube and grocery. Food in Pub is excellent value."
442,828,"Oct 25 2004	Centrally located	Stayed at the Kensington Forum from Oct 16th - 20th. We paid $75 per night through Priceline. The price was a real bargain as the published price at the hotel was 210 pounds ! The hotel is very close to the Gloucester Rd tube station, which is 10 mins away from Victoria station, or Piccadily station, where all the major attactions are. The Big Bus (hop on/op off) stops a block away, at the intersection of Courtfield Rd and Gloucestor Rd, in front of the Stanhope Arms pub. From Heathrow airport, we took the Picadilly line to Gloucester Rd station, and walked up to the hotel, with a large suitcase and a 4-year old in tow. Harrods is an easy 20 mins walk, which takes you past all the shopping district on Cromwell road. I'd highly recommend a visit to the Natural History Museum, which is 10mins by foot, especially if you are travelling with kids. The conceirge at the hotel was extremely helpful with all of our travel questions. All the 4 nights we stayed there we relished the hot Indian food takeout from the WaitRose grocery chain, which is just around the corner. The priceline booking we had was for a standard room for 2 people. But we were graciously upgraded to a triple-room which could fit all 3 of us, free of charge. The room, although clean, was extremely small, for American standards. When the sofa bed was pulled out, there was no space to move around the room - we had to literally crawl over the sofa bed to go to the other side of the room. The room was big enough to hold one large size suitcase, and nothing more. We had to fold our stroller in the passageway, before entring the room. The bathroom was so small that it had a sliding door, and not the regular swinging kind. Other than room size, we were very happy with the hotel, especially its location."
443,828,Oct 24 2004	Good Hotel Great Location.	Stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for six nights this month. Overall good hotel and very good location close to the tube (Gloucester Rd). The facilities and the rooms were very clean. The place is large and busy. Some of the staff not too exciting to deal with. The continental breakfast is terrible so unless you have to eat it go elsewhere. Otherwise very nice place to experience London from.
444,828,"Oct 23 2004	Very nice for the price	Very nice. My wife and I stayed there for four nights in the begining of October. There's a tube station right around the corner and lots of local stores and a pub nearby.The room was above average in size by European standards. The hotel has a great location with easy access to most of London's tourist sites. The staff was friendly and very helpful. My wife adds the bathroom was very clean, with nice towels and hot water every day. I would stay there again.By the way, we Pricelined a four star in the Kensington area for $85 per night and this is were were our offer was accepted."
445,828,"Oct 20 2004	best deal in London	This was the best deal ever for a hotel in London... The room is a tad small but is super clean and great location. You can also get a killer view (we were on the 18th floor! The pub in the hotel is pretty bustling too.  Easy access via tube from Heathrow, so no need to take the Heathrow Express. Also three tube lines a block away so getting anywhere was a piece of cake!Got a great deal of Priceline for Air and Hotel. This is almost a boutique hotel by London standards!!! The only negative was DONT use the phone too call people on cell phones for any length of time. I spent 10 minutes or soo on the phone calling friends on their cells and was billed $75!!!"
446,828,"Oct 17 2004	very appropiate	four nights at this hotel for my family (my wife and one 5-year-old daughter) were the best hotel in our trip (among five hotels in UK and France). The price, the space, the location and the service were the exactly right thing we wanted. We also enjoyed breakfast at the hotel. The quality was very good and the price was reasonable. I'm sure to stay here again everytime in London."
447,828,"Oct 15 2004	Great	This is a 900 room hotel so can get busy at times in the lobby but the staff, standard of the rooms and other facilities are geared up to cater for this.Yes I do stay here a lot and as such, guess that I get extra special treatment but it is in a great location with the tube within a 2 min walk surrounded by places to eat and drink and far enough out of central London to be quiet but you can still be in the west end in 15 minutes."
448,828,Oct 14 2004	Very nice !	Very nice hotel. Free wireless Internet access at the lobby if you bring your notebook. Rooms are renovated and very comfortable.Make sure you get the English Buffet breakfast included if you can. Location is very good. Downside is that there are no clocks in the room ! Can't tell the time when you wake up. Make sure you place a wake up call if you have commitments.I would definitely stay here again.
449,828,"Oct 6 2004	Excellent hotel excellent price	Stayed there for 3 nights. It is in an incredibly nice section of london Benz's and Bentleys everywhere.With Price|ine we got a great rate $75 USD per night!Right around the corner from the underground, so no taxi needed."
450,828,"Sep 23 2004	Perfect for our visit	As with most posts, I think this is a perfect place to stay in London. Can't beat the price of $75 per night through Priceline. The proximity to the Tube is great and having so many restaurants, markets, coffee places, etc. so close by is wonderful. We stayed 4 nights, Sept. 5-9. The hotel is clean and the room served its purpose. One of the better places I've stayed in London for the price. Really good Indian food is just a few blocks away. Only complaint is that my Tylenol PM and vitamins mysteriously disappeared after housekeeping came through. Would stay here again though."
451,828,Sep 20 2004	GREAT LOCATION COMFORTABLE HOTEL	This hotel is located in an excellent area of London and is just around the corner from Gloucester St tube station which has excellent service to all the tourist sites. The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms were comfortable-the staff are very friendly and helpful and the check in desk was always well staffed so it only took 2 minutes to check in and out. For the money you would pay this is a great value hotel and dont let the Holiday Inn brand put you off-in this area you could pay a lot more for worse-I would definitely stay here again when next in London.
452,828,"Sep 13 2004	Very good deal - area - security...	Excellent place to stay ( posh and upscale area). Keep away from the expensive breakfeast (honestly not worth it), go to the supermarket across the street to rack up on goodies and carry items (rice and chicken curry 6 dollars ), wear a money belt to conceal your cash during your stay in this city at all times during your touristy activities.Tube across the street, bus stop on the corner of block to the center of town....Highly recommend - went by myself and felt safe at all times in this hotel, incredibly courteous and friendly staff..."
453,828,"Sep 10 2004	Overall great	What a great place to stay. Got my room through Priceline (bid $85 which was probably too high) and was more than impressed. I was by myself and found the room to be plenty big and I had a nice 15th floor view. The only thing I worried about was the expensive breakfast but for the days of my stay - Sept. 5-8 - they had a special for 9.95 pounds (about $18) which is reasonable considering what one pays for breakfast in a big city US hotel and the buffet was excellent (included fruits, yogurt, cereals, wide variety of breads, cold cuts and cheeses, Japanese breakfast, English breakfast and lots of juices and, of course, coffee and tea).Do take advantage of the wonderful Wait Rose market (grocers to her majesty) on Cromwell. It's deli is super, you can get just about anything.For getting around London go for the all day tube pass for 4.30 pounds (about $7.75). It came in handy for me when, after getting to Big Ben, I realized I hadn't brought my camera so just hopped back on the tube to Gloucester Rd., got the camera and went back, all in about 30 minutes."
454,828,"Sep 8 2004	I can't say more!	I can't really add any more to the positive reviews that I've read here. It's all true. My experiences were the same (with the exception of the theft problem one reviewer experienced).I stayed during the second week of August and then again the last week of August (took a trip to Rome in between, see reviews of the Gambrinus Hotel, Morgana Royal Court, and Antico Doge). The rooms were consistent both times and on separate floors. The lobby is huge and the bathrooms are a good size compared to American hotels. The rooms are a bit smaller than American rooms. I would say that they are three-quarters the size of a standard Holiday Inn room in the U.S. I would believe the quality of the photos provided for these rooms. Get a twin room if possible, they tend to be a bit larger.There is an Internet cafe, laundramat and Sainsbury grocery store to the left up Cromwell Road and fast food, Banks (HSBC is best and no fees) and post offices to the right down Cromwell road. If you have a cellular phone, you can buy airtime credits at the Sainsbury grocery. Walk straight up Glouceter Road, and you'll find the Palace Gate about 6 blocks ahead as well as the area nightlife and boutique shops. Gloucester station is across the side street of the hotel (Ashburn Place). This station gets you to Baker street within 15 minutes and Kensington High Street within 5 minutes.I loved this hotel so much, that I plan to stay again when I return later this month. Fantastic, professional, helpful staff, clean rooms, great room service, fitness area and Internet/Business facilities keep me coming back. I was never a fan of the Holiday Inn chain, but this hotel has changed my mind. I even stayed at the Holiday Inn Express when I visited Las Vegas over this Labor Day holiday a couple of days ago (the rooms were HUGE and looked brand new)!"
455,828,"Sep 7 2004	Outstanding location-even an internet cafe nearby	Our family(Mom, Dad and 15 year old son) stayed at this exceptionally nice hotel in July, 2004 for three nights. We found the hotel room to be a bit small but there were many extras. The room was airconditioned and quiet(very important to us). We found the concierge to be very important to our visit. They know the best restaurants and best tours and sell tickets to everything so that you avoid lines. The hotel is very close to the Tube and a grocery store. We ate breakfast, snacks and dessert from items bought at the store. We also found an internet cafe within 1 block and this kept our son happy. We would recommend this hotel highly. DD. Ft. Lauderdale. Fl."
456,828,"Sep 7 2004	Great Hotel questionable staff	Stayed for 2 nights Labor Day weekend. Right next to the Tube station - 30 min ride to Heathrow and 10 minute ride to the Cirus. It is in a nice neighborhood with fast food, resturants, and shopping with in walking distance. The view from the upper floors of the hotel are beutiful. It is one of the tallest buildings in the area and you can see everything. ( skip the eye if your room faces east.)On the other hand, the staff was not very helpful. The light in a bathroom would not turn on and we contacted the front desk and told them this. They said someone would be up in 20 minutes but we never heard from any one. I mentioned this to the desk on the way out and they applogized but still no one showed up to fix the light. I am also argueing a $107 charge on my credit card. I am sure this will be removed but the hotel staff seems unable to explain where the charge came from.In all - 1 . the hotel is in a GREAT location. Hard to find better at this price. Convient to everything. 2. The rooms are clean but small. 3. If you can tollerate an unhelpful useless staff in a great hotel. I would recommend this one."
457,828,"Sep 6 2004	Avoid 25th floor enjoy the Sunday Jazz Brunch	If you got this place via Priceline you will love it, if you paid rack rate you will hate it. Great location, freshly renovated, very small rooms, anonymous hotel, acceptable service.Two notes:1. Do NOT accept a room on the 25th floor. You'd think you would love the view. Instead you will be confronted with a smelly guest kitchen where people microwave their stuff. The entire floor reeks!2. The Sunday Jazz Brunch from 12:00 to 3:00 is a bargain at the regular rate of 22.00 Pounds, hotel guests get it at the amazing price of 15.00 Pounds. For that price you get a glass of champagne, half a lobster and a wonderful hot and cold buffet. The buffet is great with salads, smoked fish, shrimp etc. The hot items including a carvery station are delicious. A wide range of desserts including a good selection of ice cream is included. The jazz combo is very nice, the place is a venue for middle class folks to celebrate birthdays, engagements etc. Very nice, very English athmosphere."
458,828,"Sep 2 2004	Excellent location and value	I also booked this hotel via Priceline and received an awesome deal for 11 nights (60$!) The room was very clean and efficiently laid out, although having to make due with the limited room in the refrigerator was kind of a bummer, we made the most of it! The location couldn't be better in my opinion. Safe neighborhood, lots of choices as far as restaurants and cafe's are concerned. After reading several reviews about the hotel's restaurant, we avoided eating there altogether! I would assume they charge these exorbitant prices since a large portion of the clientele is either business type, or airline employees on expense accounts! Despite this, my husband and I found this hotel to exceed our expectations, and would certainly stay again should the opportunity arise!"
459,828,"Aug 25 2004	I'll come again!	Price and location can't be beat. Hotel is only a short one and a half blocks from Goucester Underground Station. I suggest you turn right and not go on Cromwell to the hotel. Its a shorter walk inspite of the Cromwell address.Hotel is clean, a little tight by American standard, international staff at front desk, lots of lifts to get to your floor, quite rooms, good plumbing, modern bathroom, don't open the refrig. because it has sensor to count how many times you open it for beverage service, nice area, near Starbucks, pastry shops, fast foods, supermarket, walking distances to Kensington Palace, London Natural Science Museum, Harrods, Victoria Albert Musuem, pubs, and what else could you ask for. The price for triple cost me 76 pounds at the height of the tourist season. Will return to the hotel if we come to London again. Highly recommended."
460,828,Aug 21 2004	Very nice for the price	We got an awesome deal on priceline for this hotel and for what we paid it was excellent! so close to the tube station and the rooms were very nice and clean. our air conditioner leakes in one room so they moved us right away which was very nice. the only bad part is the restaurant. it is way overpriced so dont eat there! for breakfast for two was 30 pounds which is around $60 US dollars and it was pretty small! so go to the cheaper places around the hotel. We will definitely stay there again though!
461,828,"Aug 20 2004	Great week at Kensington Forum	We expected the room to be small and it was. Other than that, everything was very nice. Attentive and helpful staff, nice English breakfast offered, close to the Underground, and always taxis waiting out front. The hotel pub is adequate, if pricey, but there is a real pub a block away with a lively crowd. Certainly more than worth the amazing deal we got on Priceline, and we would not hesitate to stay here again."
462,828,"Jul 30 2004	What a Pleasant Surprise!	I am writing this review to both thank the hotel and staff, and let readers know that this is a hotel you can rest assured is top-notch. My family stayed in 2 connecting rooms this July and had outstanding customer service. We did not use the restaurants in the hotel so I can't comment on that, but I can say that the hotel provided us with everything we asked for. The rooms were also very clean and well-appointed. As said by others, an absolutely excellent location, on tube lines that will get you to just about anywhere. We don't normally stay in mainstream hotels so we were very pleasantly surprised and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel."
463,828,"Jul 30 2004	Beware of thieves in the Lobby Bar	In June I was at this Holiday Inn in Kensington, chatting with friends in bar at the hotel lobby. I had my bag beside the chair in whicj I was sitting. When I got up to go, the bag was gone. Called the hotel security who had captured the theft on CCTV...only problem was that nobody monitors the video! Video caught the whole act in progress and it seems like thieves constantly work that area, waiting until individuals are distracted so that they can make off with bags, laptops etc. While theft can occur anywhere, the fact that the CCTV is not monitored, be very careful of your personal belongings when in the lobby of this hotel. There are no notices posted to warn guests, visitors of this."
464,828,"Jun 22 2004 	Location... Location.... Location	I concure with everything thats been said here before about this hotel. I was there two nights on business and paid 115 GBP not including breakfast. I found the room size to be acceptable athough I was one person traveling alone. Found the breakfast good but way over priced you are better off grabbing aomething at the supermarket nextdoor.My only beef with this hotel is, they have no pool or at the least, a small sauna or hot tub. I feel that for a hotel that continually boasts about being the &quot;tallest hotel in London&quot; and the &quot; tall Holiday Inn in the World&quot; the very least they could do is spring for a hot tub somewhere on the property."
465,828,"Jun 21 2004	Great hotel	We just returned from a 10 day stay at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum. This was our third trip to London, and we were still looking for just the right hotel for us. Based upon the reviews here in Trip Advisor, we decided to try this hotel, and we've now found the one where we will stay on return visits. We found absolutely everything to be to our liking. Everyone on staff went out of the way to be friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable, very well-designed, and spotlessly clean. The food was delicious in both the Consortia and Forum restaurants in the hotel. The location could not have been better with being so close to the Underground station and near good restaurants, grocery stores, post office, pharmacy, Internet cafe....just perfect. The price was right, and we were even told by an English tour guide that we had gotten a very good deal. We enjoy travel and this is definitely one of the best ever hotel experiences for us."
466,828,"Jun 16 2004	Great Time at the Forum	My husband and I returned yesterday from a wonderful 7 night/8 day stay at the Forum. The hotel is perfectly situated 1 short block from the Gloucester Road underground station. It is also adjacent from a small shopping center which includes the Waitrose supermarket (which also has a wonderful deli for take-out), Garfunkles restaurant, and Boots pharmacy. Starbucks, a photo developing shop, several pubs, market and several restaurants are located within a two block radius. The hotel is set in an absolutely ideal location, offers great rates, and excellent conceirge (ask for Alan). This is the place to stay in London!!!"
467,828,"Jun 10 2004	Above Average	Travelling party of six rented three double/double rooms 5/29/04 for five nights. Rooms met the Holiday Inn expectation (clean and acceptably furnished). A/C worked well. Room was small, but that's the case in Europe. Bathroom was nice with good shower. Continental breakfast was included in the price of our room package that we purchased through Northwest Airlines, but the breakfast room on the second floor was a bit of a feeding trough. Great location, one block from the Gloucester Tube station with a number of acceptable restaurants in the area within walking distance. Nice plus was the grocery store located in the retail center between the hotel and the Tube stop. Try the nearby Hereford Arms pub."
468,828,"Jun 3 2004	Best location and unbeatable price!!!	This is an awesome location right near the Gloucester Road tube stop. So easy...the rooms are really new and clean and the staff is so nice. Definitely stay here if you are on a budget - and even if not, it's still nice and the location is really the best!!!"
469,828,"May 31 2004	Loved the Forum	The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum was a great experience. The rooms are brand new with Scandinavian furnishings, and large by London standards. Bathrooms have tub/showe combos, and the computerized climate control is great. A true bargain in the London hotel market, and a very convenient location adjacent to the Gloucester road underground station. Will definitely stay here again."
470,828,May 6 2004	Excellent location but a couple of problems.....	My wife and I plus our daughter booked (through British Airways)two standard double rooms here for 5 nights between 27th April and the 2nd May 2004. The location is excellent being a few minutes walk from Gloucester Road tube station with its good connection to Heathrow airport and to central London. Room rate including continental breakfast was very competitive. Check-in was handled efficiently and the rooms were fine. Two problems encountered during our stay. Firstly air conditioning in our room developed a fault during on evening but despite three calls to reception nobody appeared to take any action and the fault was finally cleared the following day. Secondly after checking out we received a bill from the hotel concerning two items apparently consumed from the mini bar in our room. We did not consume anything but did use the fridge to store some cheese we had purchased and we reported this fact to reception at check out. The result of this left rather a &quot;blot&quot; on what could have been a very favourable report.
471,828,"Apr 14 2004	Great location - great rate	I went to University in this area, so I was familiar with the hotel before it became a Holiday Inn property. We were very pleased with the hotel. We got a great 21-day advance purchase rate for a Queen Executive Non-Smoking Room. The room was very comfortable, clean, and rather roomy for European standards. Of course, I would not put more than 2 people in this room! We had a pant press, robe, ironing board, hair dryer, satellite TV, nice view, air conditioning - all luxuries for European hotels. The area is excellent - as Gloucester Road Station is just around the corner and you can access 3 Tube lines- District, Circle, and Piccadily. The area is also safe - as it surrounds a very posh neighborhood. I would definitely suggest this hotel - and also get the 21 day advance rate! However, don't spend the outrageous amount of money on the breakfast - just grab something near by."
472,828,"Apr 13 2004	Holiday Inn Kensington Forum works for seeing London	Spent four nites at Forum with family of four. We had two rooms at the Forum. People are friendly, neighborhood is very nice, and terrific Tube access (go back route when you get off with luggage - not Cromwell road). We had terrific price per room and seems hard to beat. We sopent two nites at Ruben at the Palace in one Executive Room. very nice and friendly as well, but Forum makes it easy"
473,828,"Apr 10 2004	Great choice in a great location	We looked at many hotels in London, but booked here due to a great 21 day advance purchase rate through Holiday Inn website. The hotel was much more than we expected - the nicest Holiday Inn we have ever stayed at. The rooms looked recently redone; great bath facilities (plenty of hot water; fog-free mirror). The only downside was small room and bath size, but we were using the sofa bed (total three persons), which are standard furnishings in the rooms, which made the room feel a bit cramped (although remade during the day) . The location could not be better - one block from the intersection of Cromwell and Gloucester Roads, with the Glouster Road tube stop. There is a great supermarket and some restaurants/pubs - we ate one night at &quot;Ask&quot;, which is a small chain of reasonable price. Close to V&amp;A, Science and other museums, and not far (10 minute walk) from Knightsbridge restaurants/Harrods, etc."
474,828,"Apr 9 2004	Great Hotel	Our family of 3 stayed here for 2 separate nights in March while connecting to another city before and after. This hotel is the largest Holiday Inn in the World and the tallest hotel in London! It was MUCH more than a 3-star that we expected. (Familiar chains rarely live up to to their image in Europe so we were expecting something pretty dowdy!) They have a consierge station (top hats and tails included!), We booked our room through an internet service and was lodged in an executive room that included all the aminities expected in a 5-star hotel! One room even had bathroom scales--a real help when you're not sure if your suitcase will make it through check-in! We did not use their restaurant facilities so can't comment there. The front desk was average and failed to tell us how our key-card operated the lights inside our room as well as unlocking the door. We asked a maid on our floor for extra towels since there were 3 of us. She was accommodating but quite cold. No problem-just doing her job and minding her own business! BIGGEST COMPLAINT-Directions! The address is listed on Cromwell (same as another H.Inn) but the front door is actually on Courtfield Road. If you arrive via the Underground, turn RIGHT and not left out of the station (BK, and KFC are across the street) . Walk to the end of the block and turn right again. The hotel is about 2 blocks down. Very convenient and we felt completely safe in the neighborhood. We would stay here again!"
475,828,"Mar 19 2004	A Fine Stay!	I visited London for the first time last December and, fortunately, chose this Holiday Inn. I say &quot;fortunate&quot; because the location was perfect for my needs as a first-timer. It was quite convenient to the Tube as well as to the Big Bus tour pickup. The hotel staff were very welcoming and the room had a great view. The beddings were more than what I had hoped for, especially the hypoallergenic pillows. The hotel room was definitely as spacious and clean as all the hotels I've stayed in mainland Europe.It was far enough from the crowded tourist areas and does not overwhelm the first-time visitor, yet provided quick access to just about anywhere including Heathrow and Kings Cross train station. I would definitely stay at this Holiday Inn again."
476,828,"Mar 3 2004	Good value. Nice hotel.	My husband and I stayed here the last week of February with our four year old daughter. We got a great rate- $118 per night including breakfast-and were very pleased with our room. It was small and the sleep chair took up alot of space when open, but everything was immaculate. This is definitely a modern hotel, no English charm here, but the location and the price can't be beat. We would certainly recommend this hotel."
477,828,"Feb 22 2004	Almost Perfect!!	My stay was for 7 nights starting Feb 10. I arrived at 1030am and my executive level room on the 5th floor was ready (not an impressive view, but I wasn't spending much time in the room). The room was spacious (queen bed, sofa, desk area - I know most European rooms are like closets). I didn't care for the color scheme (yellow) but, I've been in worse. The bathroom was small, but the tub was deep (garden). I was a 90 second walk from Waitrose Supermarket (which I used as I had a fridge) and not quite a 2 min walk from the Gloucester Rd tube (on 3 lines: Circle, District, Piccadilly). I could not have asked for more convenience. I felt very safe. There were pubs, a 24 hr convenience store, Burger King and KFC all within the general area (2min walk). My only complaints are these: no one showed me how to use the lights (you had to leave your room key in the wall), my terry cloth robe was not in the room (the above two were solved by asking the housekeeper in the hall for help), you had to go to the 25th floor for ice (I suggest bringing a ziploc bag as there are no ice holders, only cups) and the last one: my chocolate. With the executive level room, I had free tea, coffee, hot chocolate, water, juice and chocolate. I *assumed* my free chocolate was the little Kit Kat bar they placed on the inside door each day. When it was not there my last day, I called to inquire. Long story short, I was told the huge blue canister was filled with chocolate and THAT thing was my chocolate. If I had known, I most definitely would have had more of the blue canisters during my stay! ;-) For the 67.50Pounds I paid per night, this place can't be beat (my third stay in London). I will definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to others."
478,828,"Feb 10 2004	Nice stay in super-city !	We visit the hotel with three. Our oldest child of six years and my wife. This is a great hotel, nice rooms, not too big but this is not a problem. We visit London to see something of London not to sitdown at our room. We also love the service of the staff, not to foreget the kindly people which store our bags.For a great visit of London you need at least 6 to 7 days ....., we only stay 3"
479,828,Feb 3 2004	Clean room with a beautiful view!	We were pleased with the Kensington Forum. The location could not be better and best of all it was so clean. The bathroom was immaculate everytime we returned to the hotel and the water pressure in the shower is fabulous. The view from our 19th floor room was wonderful and included Big Ben and the London Eye(although they were quite small). The only complaint I might have is that the drawers were a bit cramped and made it difficult to unpack.
480,828,"Feb 2 2004	Always Satisfied with My Stay at London Forum-Holiday Inn	Stayed here 26 Dec. 2003-6 Jan. 2004 for 65GBP per night per room, tax included (21-day advace purchase, no cancellation/refund). Great rate for London. Breakfast not included and at 9GBP per person too high for a muffin, juice, &amp; coffee sort of person. I have stayed here 5 times and can't say a bad thing about the hotel. Rooms are compact, clean, recently updated, two twin beds, two chairs, desk area, small fridge, TV, and closet. Only three small drawers for clothes which is not enough when two persons are there for a two-week stay. Bathroom compact but well appointed. We had a smoke-free room on the 11th floor with a great view. Tallest hotel in all of England and largest Holiday Inn in the world.Hotel pub is a nice place to end the evening. Neighborhood is great - nice mix of residential and commercial. Gloucester Road tube station (safe, clean, bright, &quot;platform art&quot;) only a block away where you'll also find Hart's 24-hour grocer, Starbucks, KFC, Waitrose, Cullen's, several pubs, and at least 10 restaurants close by - Italian, Tex-Mex, English, Indian, etc. Sightseeing bus stops in Gloucester Road"
481,828,"Jan 30 2004	A good bet in a *difficult* city	After initial angst of getting a room, after a NY-London flight, I settled for a twin and not a double bedded room, 17th floor , small but very comfortable room, windows do open, bathroom new(as are the rooms), nice duvets and everthing worked well, breakfast is a fortune especially with dollar exchange rate (unreal), staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research !"
482,828,"Jan 28 2004	Great for a weekend in Kensington	We stayed here for a Saturday night after getting an excellent rate on Priceline. It was superbly located a couple of minutes from Gloucester Road tube station and within walking distance of Kensington, the Royal Albert Hall, Regent's Park to name a few places. We were not allowed into the room until 2pm - it seemed to be policy, regardless of whether or not our room was ready as all the other people in the check-in queue got the same message. Everything worked well, was in good condition and the room was quiet in spite of the hotel's busy location. My only criticism is the length of time we had to wait to check-in: one person at the desk had about 6 people waiting for rather too long."
483,828,"Jan 6 2004	Rooms Very Small	(Dec.-Jan. 04) My husband, daughter and I had booked a room for an eight night stay at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum. The hotel was lovely, and the staff was very polite. However, the room (which I admit, I was warned about) was extremely small. When we folded the couch out into a bed, it was impossible to move about the room. To use the bathroom, we had to climb over the bed. They admitted to me they've had numerous complaints about the room. The room would have felt small even with only two people.  After the first night, we moved to the Holiday Inn Kensington, across the street. The rooms were every bit as nice, but a lot bigger (2 queen size beds), with plenty of room to move around, including a larger bathroom. The staff was very friendly. I normally prefer Hilton, but this is one Holiday Inn I would stay at again. The location is great!"
484,828,"Jan 4 2004	Good experience - late Dec 2003	My wife and I stayed at the Holiday Inn-Kensington Forum (the high rise) for 6 nights beginning 12/26. Overall, we were quite pleased. After the long overnight trans-Atlantic flight, they let us check in around 9am. The staff was very nice. We didn't use the concierge. The continental breakfast is included, but gets old after a couple days (don't worry - Starbucks is 1 block away). Be sure to grab breakfast at the restaurant on the 2nd floor; the wait staff at the lobby restaurant was awful. Great water pressure in the bathroom, with plenty of hot water. Decent channel selection on the TV. The room was thoroughly cleaned every day. Location is great: The hotel is 1 block from the Gloucester Road tube stop, which can zip you anywhere in London fairly quickly. I agree with a prior review about cigarette smoke in the lobby: It's awful. But get used to it because you'll find more smoke everywhere in London than in the U.S. Don't hesitate to give this place a try."
485,828,"Jan 4 2004	my disappointing trip to the forum	I was very disappointed with the service from this huge hotel. When I arrived in my room with two small children the previous occupier had left unused medicine in the mini bar, this took until the following evening to get someone to remove this. Also when we booked the hotel we were told we would have a double bed and a single bed but at check in were told we had a fold down bed that when folded down stopped my daughter and myself from using the bathroom, the only way was to climb over the bed. I find this very bad planning from a 4 star hotel."
486,828,"Dec 31 2003	I'm loving it!	We stayed at the Holiday Inn for 6 days and loved it! The room was very comfortable although the cupboard space was very limited. The pub in the hotel was convenient and cozy. Service was great and the location of the hotel was very convenient (1 Min walk from the underground station). Be cautious of using the room services like the phone, mini bar and room service as the prices are sky high, but I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone!"

1,829,"Oct 18 2009 	Everything was nice except towels which were dirty with splots and hairs on it	Well, I stayed in hotel for 4 days and during these 4 days every day asked to change the towels to the clean one. After cleaning works I found the new towel in my room with splots in different place and hairs. It was awful. I think for this price they could provide with cleaner towels."
2,829,"Sep 13 2009 	Nice looking hotel terrible breakfast service	For a Holiday Inn this is a very modernly furnished hotel, and very comfortable for the price. But what's with glass doors on bathrooms? Frosted or not, there's still some things you can't hide. Other than that the rooms are great.There is free parking but unless you can get one of the handful of spaces out front the car park is a 100 metre walk behind the hotel down a lit side road through a couple of car dealerships.As for breakfast, oh dear. Buffet style full English, serve yourself. No matter when you went up to the bar there was always something that had run out and by the time it was replaced everything else was cold (I'm not assuming to was too hot when it first came out). The customer service was slow and they repeatedly brought out food to the wrong tables.Like I said, the rooms are comfortably furnished so it's a shame about the restaurant service otherwise this could be a good overnight stay. I've said below that I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend, but it's a close call either way."
3,829,"Sep 4 2009 	Very poor for a new hotel- not recommended	Beware when booking on the holiday inn website as the prices don't include VAT until the final confirmation screen.Finding the place is your first challenge. Don't rely on a Sat Nav system as the hotel doesn't have its own postcode, and you'll end up in the middle of a local housing estate. Improved signage when approaching from the south would help here. It seems that Holiday Inn arn't too sure of the location either, or they've been following the artistic-license trend of the budget airlines, because Kingston South it ain't. Surbiton would be more accurate as this hosts the closest train station and the presence of Thames Ditton Marina directly across the road from the hotel gives an even stronger clue as to the actual location.Unless you are very lucky you can expect to have to use their multistory car park behind the car repair garages at the rear of the hotel. The car park's upper level doesn't have a lift and its a 200 metre walk along an alley with your bags to to get back to reception. The trek isn't recommended for lone women, especially at night- I didn't see any evidence of CCTV. There are a couple of disabled spaces at the front of the hotel, but any disabled visitor not getting one of these spaces is going to struggle. A temporary ramp has to laid out for a wheelchair user to reach the ground floor restaurant area, which is crazy for a new building.Despite having prepaid, it's &quot;hotel policy&quot; to pre-charge 100 to your credit card for extras. This seems excessive, especially when the mini bar was empty. It's also &quot;hotel policy&quot; to allow small dogs. The two dogs in the next room were retriever sized, so hardly small, barked around 6am and left footprints all through the communial areas. There was a distinct smell in our room, perhaps from cleaning up from a previous 4 legged guest.They have invested heavily in marble floors and panelling, but much of the hotel feels drab will lots of brown panelling. The bar area chandeliers seem to re-enforce this feeling. The money would have been better invested in making the rooms large enough to have a decent sized wardrobe, instead of something only wide enough for about 2 items. The lighting in the rooms is poor, meaning it isn't possible to read in bed, and this accentuates the drab feeling.To make the bathroom lighter it has a frosted glass door from the bedroom. There are somethings you don't want to see first thing in the morning and your partner using the toilet is one of them.The buffet breakfast is best described as adequate.We used the hotel to attend a family gathering in the area, but next time we would try somewhere else, even if it was further away."
4,829,"Sep 2 2009 	Excellent service and evening meal.	We were surprised by how good it was although we had read the reviews. Situated out of town but close to the pretty riverside walk. It was the weekend but the parking could not have been easier and it was free. The new room in the new hotel was spotless. The service was first class, especially in the restaurant where the evening meal was excellent both in quality and value. The breakfast was the usual bland self service with awful tea (no indivdual pot). Nevertheless we will be back!"
5,829,"Aug 26 2009 	Express by Intercontinental	If Intercontinentals did Holiday Inns this would be it.Room was amazing despite only being a standard with a view of a carpark. Loads of mirros and the brown hues seemingly favoured by Interconti'sGreat meal, very reassuring that locals were using it. What was even better were the Indian options on the menu... what a nice change on a holiday inn menu!!!Nice stroll from Kingston (shopping and restaurants) or Hampton Court (palace and gardens) also some nice pubs very close by (head towards Hampton Court)Definately return when I am working here."
6,829,"Aug 22 2009 	Brilliant Views easy to drive to fairly close to Trains	Stayed here in August before going to pick up a friend arriving into Heathrow the next morning, and didn't want to stay at the normal airport hotels, so this was a good offer on a B&amp;B Rate. Arrived at the hotel very early, and asked if we could leave our bags so we could go into London, and at 10am they said that our room was ready and could check in. Brilliant service. Had a room with a balcony (which you need to sign for the key so they are not liable for any injuries i think) and this was a lovely way to while away some time over looking the Thames. Indeed in the evening when we came back, was great to relax on the balcony and watch the world go by. Bar service was excellent, and not that expensive. Breakfast in the morning was brilliant, and very tasty and well worth having. It is about a 15 minute walk to Surbiton Rail station, but from there, within 20 minutes you are at Waterloo station, so it is convienently located if you are ok with the walk. There is a car park at the hotel behind the Jaguar and Landrover garage which is free, although if you are carrying a lot of bags, make sure you stop in front of the hotel first to drop these off, as it is a long walk back. All in all, very impressed with my stay here, and will definetly look at booking this hotel again. :)"
7,829,"Aug 8 2009 	Restaurant Staff were 1st class	i have not had the plaesure of staying at any holiday inn but thanks to this one i would definately choose them over another low budget hotel. i stayed at the hotel on friday 7th august (which was the curry night) and had a wonderful curry buffet. i would have prefered the buffet to be on the table but the staff were very helpful, especially stuart who did everything he could to make sure that i had a pleasent stay. i was very happy with all of the staff and the value for money that the hotel had to offer."
8,829,"Aug 4 2009 	Nice modern Hotel shame about the billing problems	We were very happy to find this new hotel in our local area which doesn't offer a great choice if you want to accommodate a large party. We probably shouldn't have been surprised to see the best advertised room rates jump up immediately after we made a provisional booking for our wedding party, but we subsequently negotiated a group rate which we were very happy with.The confusion first started when we came to check in for the night. To be fair we didn't check-in until after midnight but surely this shouldn't have come as a surprise to a hotel when they are dealing with a wedding party. We never quite worked out how the hotel managed to magic up two more rooms after telling us that they were completely full ... but just as well considering they were dealing with the bride and groom!!! In hindsight we probably could have demanded some free drinks in the bar (which offered a pleasant setting for a few more drinks) while we were waiting for our room to be &quot;prepared&quot; for us.We had a deluxe room facing onto the Thames which was a good size. The dcor is elegant with lots of glass which gives a clean modern feel. The bathroom was a little on the small side in relation to the room but perfectly functional.Breakfast the next morning offered a fair selection including traditional English fry-up.Unfortunately the confusion resumed upon our return to the reception desk at check out time. I had to intervene after a relative was asked to pay a higher rate that the rate we had agreed with the hotel. A few weeks later it transpired that the hotel had 'forgotten' to bill me when I checked out and instead decided to add the charge for our room to the same relative's bill. The hotel claims that they volunteered to pay for our room which is not true. I should probably make sure that the other guests weren't overcharged too.So to summarise, a good-value modern hotel, just make sure they charge you the correct amount for your stay!"
9,829,"Jul 16 2009 	If you like walking and can cope with mosquitoes it's fine!	I had the bad luck to stay at the hotel in June, during the renovation period, but it was much quieter than I expected! The noise levels were kept to the minimum in the morning and there were no distrations at the interiors of the hotel. The good thing, is that the view is marvellous by the river! The bad thing, is that the river attracts all sorts of bugs, especially mosquitoes! So when I wanted to go out for a walk in the evening, I had to shower in Bug-Off spray before going out! Hence that thing, the rooms are cozy, a bit tight for 2 person though (especially if carrying more than 1 large luggage), yet quite funtional and with extreme soundproof. The aircon is not very well placed, as it blows the wind directly on the bed, so it gets a bit tricky to manipulate it for a good night's sleep, if you don't want to wake up with aches. All places of the hotel are very clean, the service is really fast and efficient (one of the fastest Holiday Inn room service I;ve ever seen!). The only downside, is the buggy location; But if you're more into window staring and not walking alot, then you will love the picturesque! Otherwise, get prepared for some bites!"
10,829,"Jul 6 2009 	Great Curry Food	We are local residents are came over to try out the curry night at the River View Restaurant. The food is superb. This is far the best curry food we have tasted in London.They call it the Delhi food, and its really a very good value for money. The restaurant is new and quite contempory. The service staff are really courteous and always ready to assist."
11,829,"Jun 15 2009 	more of this	this is an outstanding hotel, superb food, excellant value, very proffesionally run by all the mansgement staff and thier wonderfull team especially Adi Dewan, Sudip Sengupta, Petra and the others on at front reception on the evening of june 11th 2009 Jimmy the waiter was first class when we dined in the restaurant serving us with wonderfull food cooked by the night chef going out of his way to make our meal so enjoyable as were all the bar staff and Daniel the chef was extremely helpfull with attention to every detail of our breakfasts also. The breakfast waitresses were every morning spot on with thier attention to detail and couldn't have been more friendly and helpfull. The whole hotel was spottlessly clean and the cleaning staff although they must have been very busy seemed to have the knack of being hardly noticable. The bedrooms were so homely and comfortable with everything we could possibly need and a morning paper was delivered free to our room each day . The hotel is very close to surbiton where you can get a bus to kingston and trains into london although there arn't a lot of buses that pass the hotel to surbiton/ kingston just a very short walk along the road and up windmill lane and turn left on to effingham road stand at nearest stop and the k 3 can be got into kingston or it is a really nice walk down portsmouth road and eventually joining the riverside walk into kingston At this hotel you arrive as a guest and leave as a friend. We will always go back time and time again"
12,829,"Apr 1 2009 	brand spankingly new	stayed couple of nights whilst visiting Hampton Court palace.Only stayed here as got a good internet deal - 445 per night and rest of hotels in area were around 70 and of dubious qualityHotel is brand new opened Jan 09 and still shows, very trendy design all marble and frosted glass bathrooms etcRoom was compact but decent enough for 2 people and as usual for London and the Hioliday Inn brand. batthroom was compact but well designed so included a full size bathOverall would definately stay again although echo other comments about VAT being added seperatly so make sure yu check the priceLarge free multi storey car park behind hotelIs about 20mins wealk along river to Kingston but there are 3 pubs and an Indian restaurant much closerIdeal location for exploring Hampton Court and/or Kingston"
13,829,"Mar 31 2009 	Excellent value for money	We stayed at the Holiday Inn as we were attending a friend's wedding in Richmond Park. The hotel was a little furher away from the venue than we would have liked, but after considering the alternatives in Kingston and Richmond felt that the Holiay Inn offered by far the best value for money (and we all need to wach our pennies at the moment!)We have stayed in Holiday Inns before and, to be honest, are usually not that impressed by them. But this one was different - it just seemed a bit more proffesional and a lot smarter from the reception staff to the room itself. Admittedly the hotel is new (completed towards the end of last year) but this doesn't account for the helpfulness and politeness of the staff, which is something that you don't usually find in a budget chain hotel. As said before the rooms are a bit small but are ample for 2 to 3 nights, with everything you'd expect and more such as large flat screen TV, choice of pillow comfort (firm or soft) and a minibar with complementary water and snacks.The hotel location is not ideal in that it is at least a 20 minute walk to the nearest station and a 30 minute walk into Kingston itself (though this is a pleasant stroll along the banks of the Thames). Though there are plenty of buses that stop on the mian road outside the hotel.All in all we had a surprisingly good stay and would have no hesitation in recommending the Holiday Inn, especially when you consider what you are getting for the cost of the room."
14,829,"Mar 28 2009 	Style over substance	Small rooms. Wardrobe small, unable to hang a coat, takes c.3 garments. Small double bed. Poor lighting &amp; soundproofing. Building specification poor for category of hotel. Design pretty, colour coordinated, but uncomfortable to stay in. Dislike way Holiday Inn now add VAT at end of booking process rather than show total price. Poor value for money. Should be marketed as an Holiday Inn Express. Website incorrectly says .6 miles from station."
15,829,"Mar 25 2009 	Not Bad	I travel to Kingston a few times a year and have been trying the local hotels. This one is a bit further away than some from the centre but it is not too bad. The hotel is newish and still has that feeling, lots of polished marble floors to keep clean which were ok whilst we were there. The rooms are not huge but nicely appointed with flat screen tvs, free water and chocs in the fridge etc. Much better than some places I have stayed in locally. We only had breakfast in the restaurant, which was fine, as we tend to eat out so can't comment on the evening food. The car park was a bit of a walk away 2-3 mins which might be a nuisance in the rain, but it is free. Overall it was great value for money as we had an internet deal. It was clean and modern and the bar stayed open as long as we were there which was very late!"
16,829,"Mar 23 2009 	Rooms Too Small	We stayed at this hotel as we are Priority Club Platinum Members and had got a good deal via the website. We should get a free upgrade to a better room but if they had a better room we didn't get it! What we got was meant to be a Executive Room but it was so small. It did have a balcony which over looked a very busy road which despite the view of the Thames and a boatyard was so noisy it ruined everything else. They would have been better to put in one less room and extended the rest by 3 foot to give a less claustrophobic feel to the room. We found the food in the restaurant ok, my Husband had the Curry set meal which was good value. The 'trek' to the car park was off putting and I swear the cars at the front of the hotel were staff cars!Not sure I would stay here again."
17,829,"Mar 16 2009 	Wouldn't recommend it....Food was terrible	My husband &amp; I stayed at the Holiday Inn for nearly 4 weeks just after it opened as our house was flooded. We wanted somewhere comfortable to sleep whilst our house dried out.The location was great for us as it was round the corner from our house although for most travellers it's nowhere near a station at least a 15 minute walk. If you drive, there are limited spaces at the front of the hotel  some seemed to be permanently reserved. There's plenty of parking at the rear of the hotel but I felt unsafe walking back to the hotel - it's a pot-holed back street with a Land Rover workshop &amp; various other industrial sites. Not very nice for anyone especially a lone woman at night in the rain.The reception staff were very friendly &amp; helpful. They changed our room to another with more natural light when asked. They also supply the tickets for the free wifi which you need to request daily (not too bad) but is painfully slow, even timing out on sites like hotmail.The rooms were quite comfortable for a couple of nights but with limited wardrobe space. Personally, I found the pillows too hard. Also as the hotel was new, none of the towels had been washed before use so they wouldnt dry you!!Housekeeping were a little random  they had a habitat of leaving our window open but with the heating on full another time there were no towels not even dirty ones muddy foot prints in the hallways not emptying bins However, the worst thing about this hotel was the food so much so that despite staying dinner, bed &amp; breakfast that was paid for by our insurance, we went out for dinner at our own expense. On 4 separate occasions the food was sub-standard, but 3 of these I felt there was a risk of food poisoning raw chicken in a sliced roasted chicken breast prawns that werent cleaned probably with that brown prawn poo fizzy fruit for breakfastThe other food problem was burnt penne arabatta pasta so no problem but it meant waiting for more food to be cooked. OK so mistakes happen but these werent handled very well at all...we got offered a free dinner when the chicken was raw but our dinner was paid for!! If you do stay there, the City Arms across the road does good quality pub food thats worth a try....plus theres plenty of good restaurants in Surbiton which is 5-10 minutes walk. Da Lucio for Italian, &amp; Joy for Indian. Christies Fish &amp; Chip shop towards Thames Ditton is also good although its mainly take out, it does have a restaurant but very few people eat in.The other facilities were  business centre  a bit of a shelf with a PC!! Gym...wasnt even open Only available film on the TV was Paul WellerHopefully we wont have another reason to stay. But we definitely wouldnt let any friend or family stay there if visiting the area."
1,832,Nov 24 2009 	Friendly Staff	Stayed here for five days in Nov 09. The hotel is an older builidng but the twin bedded room with en suite bathroom was quite adequate. The location was around the corner from the Great Portland Street tube station and a bus stop with several options into Trafalgar and other points. A Sainsburys mini supermarket within a few hundred yards as well as other eateries. The rates were moderate and the bathroom was furnished with fresh towels daily. All in all good value and no more than 5-10 minute bus ride from the main shopping areas of Oxford Circus and Regents Street
2,832,Nov 14 2009 	very friendly	read reviews from the moaning minnies they would not be happy in the ritz or the dorchester.my wife and i stayed there for our ruby wedding and could not have been treated better.from check in to check out nothing was too much trouble and im in a wheelchair and my wife is also disabled.the staff smiled and talked and seemed happy in thier work which made us relax.from meals to getting us a cab to go to shows everything was done with a smile chris saunders
3,832,"Nov 7 2009 	Good experience if you are a sound sleeper	My experience was very similar to those posted here. Overall this hotel feels very much as 3 star in decor. The room decor was very holiday innish - old carpet, peeling paint. Water pressure was not so good for either the sink or the shower. The servicle desk was helpful as was the concierge. It was very conveniently located but a little hard to find at first (at least for my my taxi driver). The tours from the hotel went well. I could not get the internet to work. They connected me to a service provider to work through the issues, but I did not want to spend the time so I don't know if I could have gotten it to work. My main complaint is that I was on the 4th floor and the street noise was very loud. It sounded as if there was no walls. So I would recommend it overall if you can sleep through the noise."
4,832,"Oct 29 2009 	Great once you get past the Front Desk!'	My wife and I have just returned to the Holiday Inn at Regents Park, London, using up our Priority Club points. We were kept waiting for an incredible length of time on Reception both at Check-in and again at check-out. This Holiday Inn really needs to review its Front Desk. No smiles there! Apart from that the room was great and we really recommend the breakfast. There's a really great Cypriot restaurant two block away called 'The Four Talents'. You could be back in Paphos - marvellous food and really atmospheric."
5,832,"Oct 27 2009 	Small expensive rooms	In short, the location is not too bad and that is what you are paying for. It's a 5 minute walk to the bottom of Regent's Park but be warned that if you want to go to London Zoo, it's a further 20 minute walk or a 4 return buss ride.In terms of the hotel itself, it's fairly clean but the rooms are tiny... and I mean tiny. You can touch both sides of the wall in the bathrooms and so if you don't like small places, you will need to avoid. On the plus side, the room had climate control, extra pillows, TV with about 15 channels (including 2 or 3 foreign channels if you are from abroad) and a relatively comfortable bed. The shower isn't great but at least it had hot water. Leave the window open however, and the sound of police and helicopters will keep you up all night!In summary, if you want to shell out an average of 100 per night at it's cheapest rate, don't expect anything special."
6,832,"Oct 24 2009 	Avoid this front desk shambles	Standard holiday inn fare in a decent location but two front desk episodes lead me to recommend avoiding this hotel. Firstly my reservation made directly with the hotel appeared to vanish between its confirmation and my arriving at the hotel. An apology and a room would have sufficed but while the room was arranged after a wait, the apology didn't come. Secondly a taxi was arranged with the fromt desk the evening before for 5am to catch a flight. On arrival at the lobby at 5 am there was no record of any taxi having been arranged although a &quot;friend&quot; of the receptionist just happened to be there at that time with his car and he could take me the short distance (3 minutes away) for 15. This I fear is a scam that may be repeated every early morning for all I know. All in all most unsatisfactory."
7,832,"Oct 14 2009 	Excellent location for tubes and shopping	This hotel is located just off great Portland street  only a ten minute walk to oxford circus. Its really close to great Portland street tube and Warren Street. I stayed for two nights on business and would recommend for leisure too. Reception was very professional and breakfast was good quality, but the rooms werent great. Mine was very small, the bed was too soft and the shower was more like a trickle. There was a mini fridge and a trouser press. TV channels are very limited. Generally the hotel is good, but youd expect more for 150 per night."
8,832,"Oct 6 2009 	Clean comfortable beds and a great location	The room was not spacious but adequate for a stay of 2 nights. The beds were comfortable and a choice of pillows from the pillow menu was available. There was ample wardrobe and storage space. The all-important electronic safe was provided. The equally important kettle and a supply of teas and coffees were there. The windows were double glazed to keep out street noise. The air conditioning worked and was not noisy. The bathroom was somewhere between small and tiny but it did have a bath with shower over, a wash basin and a WC. The towels were thin and modest in size but at least they were changed daily. The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and the location could not be improved upon. The buffet breakfast at twelve pounds per person was perfectly okay. It is not The Dorchester but overall is pretty fair value for money."
9,832,"Oct 5 2009 	Great hotel location and price!	After reading many negative reviews I began to regret booking this hotel for a weekend away with my husband. However on arrival I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was large and modern with polite and helpful staff. We were upgraded to an executive room and I have no complaints - the air con worked, the bathroom was clean, the shower was superb and the bed was nice and comfy. We had managed to secure a fantastic rate - 105 for 2 nights room only - and I believe this hotel was more than worth this. We were offered breakfast and when we declined there was no problem. Great Portand Street tube station is only yards away and a walk to Oxford Street is only about 10 minutes. Well done Holiday Inn!!"
10,832,Oct 3 2009 	Ugly small rooms	The rooms need urgent refurbishment and when this will take place better to unite two rooms in one because their present space is so tiny that two people hardly could move in the room. One mast sit on the bed while the other is moving. The bathroom was even smaller. It was like a ships cabin not a hotel room and bathroom. There was an everyday change of towels etc but the duvet cover had a hole and the special surface to put on the suitcase was to dirty. I assume it cant be cleansed after all those years that its been used. I had pay in advance for my accommodation otherwise I would have left the same moment I entered the ugly tiny room although the hotel is in a perfect position for my interests.
11,832,"Sep 28 2009 	It's All About the Location	If you're looking for sumptuous decor, then look elsewhere. This hotel is for those who are simply looking for a good central hotel and don't intend spending all their precious time in London in the confines of their accommodation.I stay in London regularly on business, but this time was looking for a place for a long weekend break. What really surprised me was just how good a location this hotel offers. Only a few minutes walk north of Oxford Circus and even closer to Great Portland Street tube station, yet in quiet residential streets which assure you of a comfortable night's sleep.I'd definitely stay here again as it's a fine hotel with smart public areas, good public transport, very central and with a range of shops, cafes and of course Regents Park on your doorstep."
12,832,"Sep 24 2009 	Avoid the breakfast get a deal and it's pretty good	Smart enough hotel on the outside, well lit up, pleasant enough lobby foyer and public areas.The rooms are tired, really very tired, this was a moat house and it shows.The location is superb and calling it regents park is a disservice. It's a short walk from Oxford Circus, a shorter walk from Euston and barely a few steps from the underground at Gt Portland St (Down Bolsover st for 100 yards)Do not pay the rack rate of 250.00 per room per night, it's pure fantasy, pay no more than about 120 +vat and even then you want the breakfast included.Speaking of the breakfast, if you are a fan of stone cold rubber croissants, rubbery sausages, dried up bacon and some of the scabbiest scrambled eggs I have ever seen, then this is the place to pay the best part of $25US to get it! or you can pay about 1/4 of that in a Cafe and get fresh stuff along with non stewed coffee.The area has a few pleasant pubs but is short on restaurants, a supermarket is 30 yards away though.Bizarrely, I liked this area, it is in the shadow of the Post office tower, a short walk to Baker St and erm..... thats it.I'd stay here again given the chance, I just wish they would step up housekeeping and maintenance."
13,832,"Sep 20 2009 	If you ignore the 4* and get a good price great location but beware the surcharges	We obtained a room at the Holiday Inn via Priceline and then read the reviews on Trip Advisor and had a lot of fears. However, when we arrived it was better than expected. The rooms are small, charmless and need a touch-up, the lobby is nicely renovated but the building is downright ugly (concrete brutalism from the 1960s). However, it is nicely located near Regents Park and an easy walk t o Marylebone High Street. We took nice morning runs in the park and really enjoyed the area. One thing to avoid are the extremely high surcharges for breakfast and WiFi. You can go to Pret a Manger just around the corner (by Great Portland Street Station) and get free WiFi and a nice breakfast for a few pounds (in fact I'm writing the review from there!). So if you get a good deal ($125 per night + taxes), it is worth it."
14,832,Sep 6 2009 	Average. Basic	We stayed for one night when going to watch a theatre show. The staff were very friendly and helpful bt the room itself was very basic.You dont expect much for the price but I am sure you could get better value in other hotels in London.I dont understand their desire to give you a pillow menu when the ones supplied are perfectly fine and maybe they should spend more time thinking about things like sound proofing the windows and providing complimentary hair conditioner.All in all. Not worth the stay.
15,832,"Aug 27 2009 	Great Location poor rooms	I have never written reviews on hotels before but after staying 4 nights at this hotel, I am forcing myself to write this review so that other travellers are warned. I booked this hotel on Priority Club and after reading mixed reviews i took my chances anyway just to save my company a few bucks in these hard times. Although this hotel is listed as 4 star, there is nothing 4 star about it except maybe the Lobby area. The impression of this hotel from the exterior can be described as &quot;Shabby&quot;. Its a 4 story, greyish looking older building in which only the lobby has been truly upgraded. The hallways are small and so are the rooms. I wouldnt have minded the small rooms (this being in London ofcourse) but everything in those rooms was outdated. Furniture condition is poor, wall paper pealing, wooden closets are old and dont shut or open properly. The bathroom is awefully small. Shower head pressure was mediocre. But I will give that the room was clean. The front desk staff does try to sell you breakfast and dinner upon arrival which i made a mistake of getting. The breakfast was OK. You can have better breakfast (cheaper definitely) at Pret M or at Cafe Meze at the Great Portland Street station, a 5 minute walk. The staff is very polite though. Internet access is ridiculous, 15 GBP per night or 6 GBP per hour plus taxes and wireless access was only available if i sat by the window. Had to shut the curtain at night since my window looked directly into another room's window. I have slept on better beds in 4-star Holiday Inns and this hotel is at best 2 star by US standards or 3-star by European standards. Also, I wouldnt pay more than 90-95 GBP per night for this room if i were you. Location of this hotel is great. Maybe the reason for traffic. Oxford street is 15 mins walking, restaurants and bars abt 10 mins. But there are certainly better hotels in and around london for maybe 20GBP per night more. Would i stay here again?? Definitely not. There are better hotels in the vicinity. But the staff is definitely polite I must say."
16,832,"Aug 23 2009 	Excellent location but Over-rated	Thankfully we got a really good deal when booking this hotel because otherwise we would have felt pretty ripped off paying their regular rates.We can't complain about the location. It was close to an Underground station &amp; was fairly central to some great spots in London.We can however complain about the service. The rooms were really, really small but apparently that is to be expected for London. They didn't make up our room one day - wasn't a huge deal but there was no excuse for it. The concierge was absolutely no help at all. We wanted to book a tour from a pamphlet provided at the front desk but when asked he said it was too late. The hours said otherwise so we called ourselves - sure enough they were open &amp; happy to book us.Don't buy their breakie. It's super pricey and there is Pret Manger by the Underground with delicious fresh options. And nothing is free. You pay for internet, snacks, etc. but again that is probably typical for the pricey city of London.The hotel wasn't terrible but there is no way it would be rated three and a half stars in North America. Maybe 2.5?..."
17,832,Aug 17 2009 	Good location	Good location most sights within a 25 minute walk breakfast is good value
18,832,"Aug 12 2009 	Quiet area good location.	We stayed with my husbands points so i don't know how this compares value for money, i would pay about 80-90 a night for the hotel (at a weekend - not inc breakfast).Nice lobby, bar also nice pricey but not as pricey as others 4.99 for a small glass of wine, 4.50 for a single shot of baileys. Didn't eat in the hotel, breakfast was 16.50 each and i refused to pay it.Good location, 2 tubes nearby on different lines, we walked to St Pancras (15 mins), Chinatown (20 mins walk), Oxford Street (10 mins walk). It was also in a quiet location, not like some hotels with people screaming on the streets below and traffic noise.Rooms were spottless and the room itself was average size for London, tea coffee making facility, tv, couldn't complain (no iron though).My only issues were small bathroom and i mean small, you walked in and the door swung about 1cm from the toilet bowl, you put your arm on the sink to go to the toilet and you left would be rubbing the bath. I can't stress how small, OK for one person, but even i struggled to get in, and close the door behind me. Of you were overweight or pregnant or with any disabilities you would not be able to use it! I'm sure they have other rooms, you would have to ask. The other issue was the bed, i think they typically have one person per room (in the week), so the bed was really comfy one side(hubby's side) and the other side obvsiouly not been slept on and i felt like i was sleeping on a slope all night, terrible nights sleep, i would have asked to move if we were staying a 2nd night.Overall good location, quiet and clean."
19,832,"Aug 11 2009 	Nice Hotel in Central London	The hotel is close to Regent's Park and a few underground stations, which is a nice neighborhood if you are travelling in London. You could also walk for 10 minutes and get to Oxford Street to go shopping. The hotel itself is small, but considering that it is London, you would appreciate the fact that they have a generous lobby and relatively big room. The bathroom is very clean, with plenty of towels. Stuff like shampoo and toothpaste is also provided daily. The TV is small and old, though. There was no view from my hotel room, and I don't think the view would be great anyway... There is a small Sainsbury store right downstairs, so if you'd like something to eat or drink , it is convenient. A breakfast was included in my room rate, but I woke up super late because of the jet lag, so too bad I didn't get to eat it... Overall it is a hotel great for solo travellers, friends travelling and business."
20,832,"Aug 11 2009	Hotel ok great location	I stayed at Holiday Inn for 4 days during the month of may. I had a smoking room, it was ok, clean but the furniture was quite old (the arms of the arm-chair were scratched).The food - I only had breakfast and it was good.Anyway, the location is fantastic;)"
21,832,"Aug 10 2009 	2 star hotel with delusions of 3 and 4 stars	This hotel, Holiday Inn at Regents Park, was about the worst hotel I have ever stayed at for this price range. I expected the rooms to be small, but this was rather ridiculous  there was literally no way for one person to get around the other while standing on the floor; one of us had to get on the bed to let the other pass. The bathroom is so small that you are unable to sit straight on the toilet because the sink is in the way and you have to lean to the side to sit down! On two occasions, the cleaning crew neglected to leave any toilet paper and we had to call for it  most days, the toilet was never really fully cleaned. On two other occasions, the sheets were not changed; just the beds were made up again. They forgot our wakeup calls on 5 separate occasions. Of the 3 elevators, only one was working during our entire 2-week stay there. The staff were not trained well at all; one owlish fellow just looked at us when we asked questions; the night manager was condescending to the extreme, and on one funny occasion, I had to show the concierge how to place a call to my kids room; the fellow had no idea how to make an internal call to a hotel room. Finally, the hotel surcharge bill had to be revised as it contained a bunch of bogus mini-bar charges. I should mention that local calls (to London) were charged at a hefty price (one pound for the first minute, and then 50p thereafter), and it cost even more to call a cell number in London (2.5 pounds for the first minute). On the good side (not many), the hotel is ideally located (very central), but then again, so are about a dozen others. The food was OK, the few times we had room service."
22,832,"Aug 8 2009 	It was just OK - not a 4 star hotel	My husband and I were given a smoking room at first since they didn't have any non-smoking available. The room was horrible! It looked old, unclean, and the furniture was falling apart! The worst part was the smell! We only had to bear it for one night because they moved us to a non-smoking room the next day, so we were actually pleased with the service they provided. Our new room could be described as average. It was a lot better than the first room but it still did not seem like a 4 star hotel to us. This was definitely a 3 star hotel. As for the location of this hotel, we werent very pleased. It is close enough to the tube, but not the underground line we preferred. We always had to walk to the Warren Street tube which worried us a bit during the night. We always walked along Euston Street since it was a main street and although it wasn't very busy during the night, it was safe enough. We usually had to pack our things in the morning and wouldn't get back to the hotel until night time. It was too much trouble to come back to it during the day. Next time we will stay at a hotel closer to the city center and attractions. Besides all the negatives, we couldn't complain about the service. Our room change was given without any hassle. We frequently requested cabs in the morning and they were always on time. We had friendly wake-up calls. Overall, the service was good. The hotel was a good 3 star hotel."
23,832,"Aug 5 2009 	Starting as nightmare-ending ok	First of all at the check in i had ask for a smoking room and they gave as a room that was smelling even inside the closet!I was in a shock the minute i went in to the room!I couldnot breath inside the room,it felt very dirty!So i went down to the reception to complain.She said to me that all smoking rooms were like this!!I asked for a non smoking room to avoid all this smelling atmosphere and they send as to a room with urine on the toilet seat,dirty showertube,i am sure that the bathroom was not cleaned!Icalled the cleaning lady who was at the hallway that moment and asked her kindly to clean the toilet. She said the urine was just water and she took it away with a towel she was holding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!After that i went for the third time to the reception and asked again to change room.Our last room was ok and with a clean toilet.And it was every day clean and tidy maybe becouse it was in another floor and there was another cleaning lady.Breakfast was very good and location also good becouse the hotel is near the metro station."
24,832,"Jul 26 2009 	Fair quality hotel in a good location	I got this hotel when I bid on Priceline for two nights I and was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. Although the hotel doesn't really have many 'wow' factors, it does offer clean and comfortable accommodation in a very convenient location, just a 4-5 minutes walk from two Tube stations and 10 minutes walk from Oxford Street. Yet despite its convenience, the actual area it's in is fairly quiet. Out of curiosity I did decide to try the breakfast on one of the mornings I was there and found they had a good selection of hot and cold options. At 16.59 this was expensive compared to the local cafes but not too bad by hotel standards, and I believe I could have got it slightly cheaper if I'd bought a voucher in advance. There is a small Sainsbury's a couple of minutes walk away, so on my first morning I had a picnic breakfast in Regents Park for about 3!One small problem was that I found my key card wouldn't work on the second day and when I made enquiries at the desk they said they thought I was only staying for one night. It turned out that when I had first checked in they confused me with someone else. I had not originally shown my Priceline printout because the receptionist did not ask for it and I assumed she had the details on the screen she was looking at. The matter was sorted out fairly quickly, but the moral is always to show your booking printout even when they don't ask for it, especially if you have quite a common surname. This advice would apply to any hotel, of course.I am giving the hotel 4/5 because of the good rate I got through Priceline. Had I paid twice as much more (as I could have) and I wasn't in a very good mood, I think a 3/5 would have been more likely. Having said that, if you can get a rate under 100 a night I would say it's worth giving this place a try."
25,832,"Jul 25 2009 	Conveniently Located To The Tube!	I pricelined (priceline.com) a deal for a 4 star place in London and ended up here. The outside of the building can give you a terrible impression, but the inside was really nice and put together. There always seemed to be an event going on in the large conference rooms right off the lobby. The location was perfect! Between two different tube stations that both had different lines going to all parts of the city. Walking down towards Oxford street was lots of fun and we passed so many places that looked tasty to eat at. We ended up being upgraded (unknowingly) to an executive room. It was really nice and very clean. The bed was super comfortable which is rare in Europe. My inlaw's did not get upgraded and their room was noticeably shabbier but had all the same amenities. If you are all bothered by light construction noise, ask to be put NOT on the backside of the hotel. They are building a condo building and it could disturb you if you do not close the windows. With the windows shut, you can't hear a thing. The construction looks like it will last another 6 months till it is finished. Three minor complaints:- They rip you off for internet. 15 pounds for 24 hours is a ridiculous rate! But we had to pay it since we're the kind of traveler that mixes working on business with pleasure. - The elevators weren't working properly and many people were complaining. We ended up having to take the stairs in the morning along with lots of other guests. - The concierge arranged for a private car to take us to Gatwick airport and insisted in would only take 45 minutes. Well, it takes at least 30 minutes longer then that and we almost missed our easyjet flight. We had to cut in security lines and run thru the airport as fast as could to make it. We also felt a little ripped off at the price of 65 pounds. It's got its plusses and minuses, but you get what you get when you book only one week in advance. The hotel bar is great too and doesn't close till late late late in the early morning."
26,832,"Jul 19 2009 	Not a 4 Star	First of all, I just wrote a glowing review of the Novotel Effiel in Paris, so I'm not one of those people that slam hotels for no reason or have unrealistic expectations. That being said, this Holiday Inn, AT BEST, is a 3 star. There is nothing 4 star about it. Lobby is tiny, beds are cheap and small, there are no views at all, room service is bad, with a very limited 24/7 menu, there is a persistent smell in the hallways, ceilings in all areas are so low they're claustrophobic, and the mini bar has one of those pressure sensor things so you can't put your own stuff in it. The rooms are extremely small, and the decor is old and worn. The bathroom is equally dated, and tiny. I don't know how this property could possibly be rated a 4 star. I only paid about $130 a night on priceline, but I would have gladly paid an extra $70 a night for a true 4 star. That's how bad it was. My recommendation would be to stay elsewhere unless you can stay here for less than $100. And then, don't expect anything more than a 2*."
27,832,"Jul 8 2009	Central hotel a little gem!	Stayed here with my 11 year old daughter on a weekend break. Centrally located, 5 mins walk from Tube station. Wonderful food, staff couldn't do enough for us. Highly recommended"
28,832,"Jun 29 2009 	Very good not amazing. But very good.""	I stayed here from June 16 to the 19th for leisure with my friend. The hotel is all of a block away from the tube station which is a major relief. And while the n'hood is rather quiet and plain, it comes in handy when you trying to get some rest from the hustle and bustle. Our room was very clean, plenty of fresh towels, and clean linens. Th check in was very speedy as well. The staff even helped me find some good clubs. Keep in mind that there is construction being done on one side of the hotel, so you might want to request to be on another side. And if you need ice like myself, you got to go to the bar downstairs. True their maybe better but this place was very god."
29,832,"Jun 28 2009 	What a gem! Fantastic!!!	I have just returned from a 3 night stay. I travelled with my mother for one day of business and the rest leisure. I have never received better service, not even in a 5* hotel. The location, accomodation, staff, amenities, service were all excellent. A walk away from the heart of everything. The rooms had everything you may require, if you needed anything the staff were happy to help and deliver in any way they could. The breafast was the best I have ever had, and this was consistant. My only slight cristicism would be that the rooms are rather compact and small and more information for travelling would be beneficial.We are so impressed that we will be returning without a doubt. A tip - we booked through teletext and it was 130 cheaper, per night, than booking direct or on the internet - we paid 75 per night for Bed and Breakfast !!Fabulous!!!!!!! 10/10"
30,832,Jun 27 2009 	Good enough for Award Night stay	I am fortunate enough to have a few award nights saved up. I booked online thru Priority Club website. I did not expect to be able to gat a room on 1 day notice. The hotel was ordinary but in a decent lacation regarding access to London transportation. True the hotel is set back from the busier raodways and has no real view but adjcent buildings. I thought the staff was helpful for my needs and offered some good advice for using the outside telephone booth instead of in room phones for long distance calls. I needed to call credit card companyon their toll free number but was told I would still be Charged excessively. High Speed internet available for a fee. Seems most amenities are extra charge.
31,832,"Jun 27 2009 	Disgusting	This hotel was a disgrace. Yes; the rooms were tiny etc. but there had been no effort to effectively clean anywhere even to a satisfactory standard (urine on toilet seat, hair everywhere no not exact being picky about minute detail. The place smells putrid and the staff couldn&quot;t care less. When I asked about an adapter plug she said they were all being used by other guests but could not be bothered to point out that they were also sold in vending machines in the hotel. First thing I did after I left the hotel was get a shower somewhere else. Even if you have a great trip to London, this dirty hovel will still leave a stain on your whole experience and my advice is certainly to try and get in the cheapest Ibis/Travelodge etc. as that will be infinitely better and much cheaper."
32,832,"Jun 23 2009 	Even a Travelodge would be better	To be quite honest I'd rather stay at a Travelodge than this hotel. The rooms are similarly basic but I wouldn't have paid the best part of 150 for the privilege.From it's cramped lobby to the tiny rooms with well-worn furnishings this hotel was disappointing, not least in that labeling it &quot;regents park&quot; is totally misleading.It's a drab building of grey concrete slabs, down a back street just off Marylebone Road with zero views and zero personality. Check in was efficient enough but for the first time in any of the chain's hotels, no recognition of my Platinum Priority Club status and no offer of any upgrade or Priority Club benefits.There are much better quality and located hotels for the same price in London. Give them your hard-earned cash."
33,832,"Jun 2 2009 	Do not let staff call you a Taxi!!	My impression of the hotel (which until then I found adequate) was ruined as I departed. At checkout the staff insisted (quite aggressively) to call the taxi for us. We were planning on taking the train to Heathrow and just need the taxi the mile or so to Paddington station. They convinced us to take a cab to the airport based on the combined price of the train and the taxi to the station. Our cab driver informed us that they set the prices and that we should have called ourselves. He would normally charge 35 pounds for the trip, but the hotel set the price based on what they thought we would pay (55 pounds in our case, 65 for the couple after us). Of course, they also set the price of the cab to the train station absurdly high so we would chose to take the cab to the airport instead of the train. I don't appreciate being scammed in the name of &quot;customer service.&quot; POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE."
34,832,"Jun 1 2009 	Very nice hotel in a great location	I have just returned from a 2 night weekend stay at the hotel, booked via the Priority Club on a &quot;Two nights for the price of one&quot; basis. The hotel is in a great location, just a couple of minutes stroll from Gt. Portland St tube station or about a 15 minute walk from Euston. There are some nice cafes / bars / restaurants all nearby to the hotel - we ate one night at an Italian round the corner called 'Conchiglia' - on Great Titchfield Street (Corner to Clipstone Street, Great Portland Street) which served lovely food at reasonable prices. On the next corner there is a lovely smaller restaurant / bar - didnt eat here but sat in the sun outside with a nice bottle of wine, served with complimentary crisps, popcorn &amp; nuts! For breakfasts there is a little place 'Cafe Meze' right next to Gt Portland St tube which serves a very tasty full english breakfasts for about 5 amoungst lots of other things. We didnt eat in the Hotel so I can't comment on what their food was like (the restaurant looked nice though)....the drinks were on the expensive side but you would expect this at any Hotel bar.The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and we were able to check in as soon as we arrived even though it was before 2pm. They forgot our paper the first day but to be honest we would not of had time to read it! We did mention this to reception and they made sure we had one delivered the following morning.The rooms in the hotel are small - but this is London - you expect that! They were not tiny though &amp; there was a double bed with side tables, a double wardrobe (with free safe), a desk and a coffee table in ours &amp; still plenty of room to move about. There was a minibar fridge in the room along with tea &amp; coffee facilities - we had upgarded to executive level so we also got 4 free bottles of water &amp; 2 kit kat chunky bars! Along with nice big bathrobes! The rooms were very modern &amp; tastefully decorated. Very clean too - even the shower curtain looked brand new! Maid service was daily with fresh towels provided. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesnt want to be right in the middle of the hustle &amp; bustle of london but wants easy access to it if required whether it be by walking 10 mins down the road towards Oxford St or jumping on the tube. Regents Park is about a 10 minute walk away in the other direction, well worth a walk to especially if the weather is nice."
35,832,"May 30 2009 	it's not 4 star !!!	hii,we, me and my colleagues, stay in this hotel for exebition on may 09 for a week.the hotel is located at the best place near to oxfort street and near by there is a lot of bars and resturants. but.... the rooms are all same and very very samll !!! we can't even moov in the room in the same time.the brakefast was very standart. the price for internet are 15 pound for 24 h....the service in the lobby is not frandly and thay don't help you to get a place for the evening....the taxi drivers help you a lot more...search another hotel to stay in london !!!!"
36,832,"May 29 2009 	incredibly small bed....	I booked this as a secret 4 star hotel to stay 2 nights. .We had been away for a month's holiday and were looking forward to seeing our daughter (who lives in London) before finally returning to Ireland. Arrived from our 11 hour flight and trip in from Gatwick to be told we couldn't check in until at least 2 o'clock. So went to the bar to have a coffee and keep our eyes open! Finally got to our room to discover this tiny bed... well in this day and age I consider an old fashioned double 4 ft 6 inch bed to be unreasonably small in a modern hotel. I measured its width with my luggqge strap and went down to reception to ask why we had such a small bed and was curtly told that all the beds were the same size in the hotel! We had suspected that our room was for a single disabled person as the bathroom had hand rails &amp; emergency pull cords everywhere and the loo was an extraordinary height..as was the wash basin !! But no this was a standard room according to the female behind the desk!!! My husband had caught some kind of flu/fever during our flight and really didn't feel well so just wanted to go to bed. However he is 6 ft 4 and found the bed too small.. even when he was on his own in it! I went back down to reception explained the situation (his height and his flu!) and requested extra bedding so that I could sleep on the floor saying that neither of us would sleep if the two of us had to share this small bed. Her whole attitude was that I was an annoying inconvenience. However the bedding was delivered up to our room and I settled onto the floor seething at this definitely not 4 star treatment. By contrast, a month earlier we had stayed out by Gatwick airport (less than a five minute taxi journey from the airport) the night before we flew out to Cuba. Had only booked the hotel that day and only paid 59 for the room... so was very pleasantly surprised to find we had a king size bed and there was also a decently sized single in the room . This was a well known chain who have no pretensions at 4 stars, but would be preferable to stay in than the Holiday Inn near Regent's Park!The only good experience at this hotel was the concierge who was charming and very helpful."
37,832,"May 27 2009 	Weekend Wedding	Got this double room on Priceline 61 plus tax for two people per night, so can't complain about that. Decent area, safe and convenient for tubes and Oxford Street, also quiet. Good restaurants around and right opposite a small Sainsburys. The room was clean, bed ok, double glazing, nice bathroom until the cold water tap broke over the bath and I couldn't stop the water, but nice guy came and then Duty Manager, they managed to stop the water by removing the tap, offered us another room, but as this was our last night didn't bother. Staff friendly. Excellent storage parking, cost 27.00 to leave our car in safe carpark from Saturday morning until Monday 10.00 a.m. provided we didn't use it.Only downside, breakfast was not included and it usually costs about 17.00 but you can pay just over 10.00 for it. Had it first morning but to be honest not worth it, tasted like powdered eggs, tea in mugs, staff not very attentive. Second day went and had all day breakfast for 4.50 locally which was really good. On the whole though a good stay."
38,832,"May 25 2009 	Great Hotel in good location	I have just stayed, with my brother and his wife, over the May bank holiday weekend. I recently stayed in The Holiday Inn Tiberias Israel but this hotel couldn't have been more different!! This hotel had lovely clean rooms and bathrooms, nice public areas and a great staff!! The breakfasts were superb - hence one could 'stock up' before a long day tramping the streets of London. A throughly enjoyable stay!!! Thanking you"
39,832,May 21 2009 	You get what you pay for!	Stayed four nights in January on a cheapie deal from Hotwire.Room shabby but clean. Not the amenities of a ****; ** would be more accurate. I was paying a ** price so can't complain.Internet expensive and slow.Breakfast overpriced - instead go to Starbucks or Tesco nearby.Convenient location to Tube &amp; buses.Sunday morning had a real fire - hundred of guests out in the street with no direction or explanation. Later found it was a deep fat fryer in the kitchen.Can't recommend unless you have a bargain rate.-lusophile
40,832,"May 18 2009 	No service staff don't care and a bad breakfast.	Was taken to London by a friend as a treat and she booked us into this hotel. Rooms were damp and the whole corridor smelled of cigarette smoke, even thought we asked for a non smoking room. Asked to moved rooms but reception said all the floors were like that!Breakfast overpriced and hot food had been sat there for hours.Really disapointing stay as I expected so much more from a Holiday Inn."
41,832,"May 18 2009 	Excellent location for the theatre!!	My mum and i have just returned from a 2 night stay at the holiday inn. We paid 160 for 2 people for 2 nights a very good price in London. The room was small, but very clean and had everything you need for a stay in london. You only use the room to sleep and change! The breakfast may seem steep at 10.50 but the food was lovely and fresh. There were excellent choices of tea, fresh coffee, pastries, cereal, fresh fruit and yoguart, cooked breakfast, toast and fresh juices. The waitress kept our mugs full of hot drinks and were lovely and polite. We went to see haorspary on friday night and sister act on sat both excellent shows. The palladium theatre was within a 20 min walk from the hotel where we saw sister act and excellent show!! The sreet the hotel is on is next to a local sainsburys and tesco but on a lovely quiet street so you don't get the noise of the hustle and bustle that is london. I have just booked to go back in a few months for another theatre break!!"
42,832,"May 10 2009 	not up to expectations	I'd definitely expected more after my stay at the other Holiday Inn (Bloomsbury). Shows that you can't really rely on hotel chains. Everything was just not quite right (not sure if the towels were really clean), definitely for the price you pay and the four stars. It looked like it needed a refurb. Something I find important: croissants...they were tasteless."
43,832,May 1 2009 	Basic but perfect location and perfect staff	The hotel's room was very basic but very clean and the staff of the whole hotel was really helpful and nice. The breakfast very good but the best part of it was the hotel's position. 0.5 -1 minute to the underground station and 10 minute walk to oxford street and picadilly!!
44,832,"Apr 20 2009 	Good 35 star hotel	We stayed here for 4 nights Easter 2009. It is expensive time so we made a great deal on Hotwire. We had two interconnecting rooms in non-smoking floor just as asked. The rooms were good sized for London and the beds very comfortable. The hotel was clean and reasonably well located for us. We walked to tube stations on Warren and Great Portland street and sometimes we walked down to Oxford Street. The staff was friendly an efficient, we checked in an out in very quickly. I would stay here again if I got a good price, it is 3,5 star hotel and I would not stay here if I expect 4-star hotel. I think the most important things for me were fulfilled here: good bed and linen, clean rooms and bathrooms, good A/C and good location. Our rooms faced inner yard and the rooms were incredibly quiet."
45,832,"Apr 11 2009 	Nice basic hotel near Regents Park	This hotel was a nice Holiday Inn, with larger sized clean rooms, in a good location and with good service. The hotel is located near the south end of Regents Park, and is within walking distance (30 minutes) of the theater district and shopping district. There were two underground stations within 3-5 minute walk (Great Portland Street and Warren Street stations). The area was quiet at night. There were lots of restaurants in the area within a 3-5 block radius. The room was basic and clean, with all the amenities you would expect. The room and bathroom were quite big, compared to the much smaller rooms in hotels that we have previously visited in the UK. We had a package deal, and breakfast was included each day. There were a large variety of breakfast items, it was quite good. Overall, this was a nice, basic hotel with larger than average rooms and a good location."
46,832,"Apr 6 2009 	Enjoyable stay and friendly staff	Just back from a two night stay, Booked through the priority club on a B&amp;B basis. I read the reviews before hand so didn't really know what to expect. We had a great stay overall, rooms were small but very clean and comfy...tea coffee making facilties, hairdryer, iron , mini bar.. Small touches like water and a bar of chocolate. Breakfast was excellent plenty of fruit, cereals and hot stuff.The staff were great, really friendly and helpful and respectful....bar prices a bit steep but then it's london. My parents had a pre theatre meal the only complaint was there was too much to eat !! The bar area was very relaxing and welcoming.The hotel is about 10 mins from Oxford street tube and the shops and 5 mins from Great Portland tube street and Regents park....... very handy ...there are lots of pubs and restarants en route. Got itckets for the theatre ( last minute. com 60% cheaper than the normal ticket websites, my parent got the 3rd row ) Would recommend this hotel, ok it might not be really posh but great value for money and the staff made it !!!"
47,832,"Apr 3 2009 	Time for a refurb	I have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the years, its a great location for Regents Park, Oxford Street,Soho and the West End and the staff here are brilliant, friendly,courteous and efficient. But it really is time to update the rooms,the lounge, and the restaurant. The furniture in my room needed placing in a jumble sale, likewise the chairs and tables in the lounge, bar area, and could you please make the whole hotel non smoking I felt as if I'd smoked 10 cigarettes walking along the corridor to my room past the smoking rooms."
48,832,"Mar 27 2009 	Great Deal But not Four Stars	After making a very low bid, Priceline assigned me this hotel having rated it four stars. It is a good, clean and reasonably well located property, but not a four star hotel. They should have rated it three and a half stars. My savings though were not as big as I thought, but still a great deal. It is run of the mill Holiday Inn, maybe a bit more upscale than the ones in the US, but the amenities are similar. The rooms are of a good size (for London at least) and the beds are comfortable. Internet is very overpriced but there is a good alternative by the YHA (Youth Hostel) on Bolsover Street, two blocks south. The that YHA also has a great breakfast deal (continental) and other meal deals, which includes WiFi access for 60 minutes. There is a Sainsburys nearby and plenty of restaurants. It is very accessible to at least four Tube stops. The lobby is a bit dated. Overall a good stay, but not what I expected as it regards to a four star property."
49,832,"Mar 26 2009 	Typical Hoiday Inn	We stay in Holiday Inns a fair bit and this is as you'd expect; clean, comfortable, good staff and definitely a top of the range 3 star. Check-in was quite slow but only because there were two guests in front checking-in who seemed to think they were staying at the Ritz, demanding this and that. Room was spacious, spotless and the bathroom and shower were the same. Concierge very helpful and there was no problem storing baggage at the beginning and end of our stay. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from Great Portland St tube and about 5-10 from Regents Park tube, it's near to Regents park (as the name suggests) and about a mile from Marylebone mainline. Didn't use the restaurant but the bar was OK, if a little pricey; 6 for a glass of house red. If you get a discounted price, stay here."
50,832,"Mar 15 2009 	Not a 4 star	I just got back from 5 nights at the hotel. Many people would not like the location because it is a little far from the main attractions. However, I liked having strolls and lunch in Regent's Park so much that I might stay in the area again. The British Museum is about a 20 minute walk away. The staff at the hotel were very friendly. However, the hotel was advertised on Priceline as a 4 star, and it wasn't. The rooms were a little shabby, smelled of smoke in non-smoking rooms, and had many little things not working properly, such as broken lights and a broken lock on the door. I didn't get my wakeup call on my morning to leave either. Don't use the internet! It was overpriced and both computers had problems. I didn't eat there but the food looked tasty. I've traveled many times to London, and it was one of the lower quality hotels I've stayed in--but certainly not terrible. I'd recommend not paying over 100-120 USD, including tax, for this hotel if you choose to stay."
51,832,"Mar 15 2009 	Excellent location good room (but bad business center)	Good location for this hotel, ideal for people who want to stay in the center of London. Count about 15 minutes by foot to Oxford Circle or to the British Museum. Rooms have an adequate size, and the staff is fine.The only problem is the &quot;business center&quot;: two old computer which connect very slowly to the internet... for 3 pounds per 15 minutes! Wi-fi is available, but costs 15 pounds for 24 hours - simply ridiculous prices... After complaining to the staff about that, I was told that another company is in charge of those computers. I called them, but they were not helpful at all. Finally, I paid for an internet connexion I couldn't use...Apart of that, I would recommend that hotel, also because it has good bus and subway connexion nearby."
52,832,"Feb 27 2009 	Clean modern bright excellent location	My husband, two year old son and I just got back to Canada from a weekend in London. We stayed at the Alhambra Hotel for the first night and then at this hotel for the second two nights. We staying here for free because of a British Airways promotion. After staying at the Alhambra Hotel, this Holiday Inn was a delight. The whole hotel was very clean. The hallway had some wear, but they were painting and working on it while we were there. Our room was very clean and spacious. For London, the room seemed very large. There was plenty of room for a cot (pack and play) for my son. The restaurant was nice looking, but I thought the food liked pretty greasy. I ended up only having continental breakfast. There was plenty of cereal, toast, fruit and pastries. My husband liked the breakfast. He had eggs, bacon, sausage, beans and the &quot;continental&quot; breakfast I had. The staff in the restaurant and at the desk were very efficient and helpful. They were very nice to my son especially. The location was excellent. It is very close to two tube stations: Great Portland Street and Warren Street. Warren Street station is only a few stops away from Buckingham Palace and the House Parliament area. If you have lots of time, you could probably walk to most locations. We were only in London for a couple of days, so we took the tube mostly.Internet access was not free. I had to pay 10 pounds for wireless internet access. I needed it for some work I needed to do while I was there, or else I would have not paid for it. Overall, it was what I expected, very similar to other Holiday Inns I have stayed at in North America."
53,832,"Feb 22 2009	Nice rooms and great breakfast	First of all please note the date of stay!!we booked this hotel as part of a package with train travel and theatre tickets. we found the hotel very comfortable and on par with many of the major chain hotels we have stayed at in and round london over the years. No the hotel was not luxury but it was clean tidy and tastefuly decorated.We foound the hotel to be further away than we had anticipated of the west end but public transport in the area is good (10min walk to kings x, 2 min walk to either of the closest tube stations).Excellent breakfast and pleasant staff; however I would not have paid the full price advertised in the hotel itself for a nightly rate. 200 ish!! (We paid less than that for two nights)."
54,832,"Feb 20 2009 	Brilliant Stay!!!	Me and my partner travelled to Holiday inn from Cheshire as a long weekend break away.we were very pleased with the hotel and was in a conveniant location. the staff were very helpful during and prior to the stay. As i contacted the hotel through e-mail about directions to get from Euston Station to the hotel. We were upgraded to an executive Suite which was very comfortable and cosy. Only one negative side, was eating in the restaurant was slightly expensive however the portions were HUGE and compensated for the price. Breakfast was very nice and suppiled more than was needed, and had excellent service from staff who were always on hand to supply more tea and coffee.Overall we had a brilliant stay and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would come back to this hotel again."
55,832,"Feb 17 2009 	Not bad but I have stayed in better Holiday Inns.	I, my wife and a couple of friends of ours stayed in Holiday Inn Regent's Park from 6 to 9 of Feb. Had two rooms and as I said in the title, overall the hotel is not bad but I have stayed in better Holiday Inns over the last few years. The location is very good. Very close to a tube station (Great Portland Street), only 10 min. walk to Oxford Street or Regent's Park, small restaurants and Starbucks very near the hotel. For an extended weekend like, ours was a great place to stay. We had 2 smoking rooms in the 2nd floor. The hotel did not seem crowded, so it was nice and quite. Check in was quick and friendly, everything seemed OK by then. But the rooms were quite small. I don't know if it was my idea, but all the other HI that I have stayed had bigger rooms. The room though had all the amenities that you would expect (coffee maker, iron board, hair dryer). The bathroom was also small but seemed clean. The sheets also smelled and felt clean so apart from size everything else was OK. Breakfast was nice, hot, with all the goodies that you find in hotels. Breakfast is taken in The Junction Restaurant, the food of which we tried one night and it was quite good.  Overall it was OK. If you ask me if I would stay again, I would tell you yes for the location, but I would maybe try something else next time. If someone is thinking of going, I would say do, there is nothing that can make me tell you don't go!"
56,832,"Feb 17 2009 	Good Hotel	Considering the superior hotels and their high prices as well as the many affordable but unpleasant hotels in London, this is a pretty good place. Check in was a git slow.I stayed in a single room which was on the small end. It's fine if you are only going to use the room to sleep at night. If you want to work in the room and spend quality time, the single room is not for you. I booked the room at an exceptional promotional rate at 65GBP, so really cannot complain about the size.Bathroom is a bit dated but not poor quality. Old TV in the room. No iron as listed. I requested one and never showed up. Location is fine. Close to two subway stations and buses run almost 50m from the hotel towards Oxford Circus. There's a cafe nero near by for a quick breakfast or coffee.Overall, it is a good hotel without any luxury."
57,832,"Feb 16 2009 	Quiet with a good location	Location is great. Close to 3 tube stations, but walkable to most of Central London. On a quiet side street.  The hotel is an updated Holiday Inn, similar to HI's everywhere. We found the room small, but adequately sized for two of us to stay one week. Not much drawer space, but enough shelves and hanger space to make up the difference. The windows opened, the temperature controls worked, and the room was very quiet. The bed was a bit firm. Bathroom was small, but well planned with enough counter space for both of us. The towel warmer kept the bathroom a little on the too warm side, but I suppose it was nice having warm towels. The window looked out on an internal &quot;courtyard&quot;, so no view. I found the employees to he helpful. I did not eat or drink at the hotel, so I can't offer opinions on those options.  If, like us, you want a decent place to sleep after long days of walking, this is a good option. Especially if you get a good rate, like we did through Hotwire."
58,832,"Feb 16 2009 	Nice Hotel Good Price	I got this hotel through a blind bidding process on Priceline. As always it's a hit or miss proposition. In this case it was a hit. It is a very conveniently located hotel with a grocery chain &quot;quick-stop&quot; just across the street, which helps tremendously to save money! The room itself is a typical UK style, small, compact. The room is clean and quiet! The staff are all friendly and helpful.Great breakfast with full spread and real coffee."
59,832,"Feb 14 2009	Good stay at hotel	The hotel looks a bit brutal on the outside but it is modern and inviting inside. There were only smoking rooms available when I arrived but I was found a single non-smoking room. This room was smallish but the bed was large for a single bed, about half way between a single and a double. The decoration in the room was good but the bathroom looked a little &quot;shabby&quot; - mainly the tileing and the woodwork. The cost of wifi at 15 oper night and only available in the lobby was expensive and inconvienient so I didn't bother."
60,832,"Feb 2 2009	mouse	Just wanted a weekend away with a friend after a illness. We booked in for 2 nights. I have stayed at other holiday inns and have always been very happy. We booked in on friday afternoon. The staff very friendly. Room very small and not too clean. The bathroom very small. Towels didn't smell fresh. We booked in an non smoking room. but only to find we were near smoking rooms and the smoke was very strong even in our room. We also smelt, well how can I put it , someone smoking &quot;pot&quot; it was very very strong. this was early evening after returning later that evening the smell and smoke was still there! We went to bed my friend got up about an hour later to find a MOUSE runnning across the bedroom! It was a nightmare. In the morning we were moved to other room, and I complained also about the smell and the smoking and they were aware of it told that the people smoking &quot;pot &quot;have been asked to leave that morning! That night we were so frigtened, as we HATE MICE we didn't sleep that night either for fear it may happen again. To end the weekend nicely as we were leaving the c/maid was washing cups in sink and drying them on a towel- disgusting! Never again will I stay in a holiday inn. Since returning I have complained to customer services only to be told there is nothing more that can be done as I wasn't charge for the night with the MOUSE! Really good customer relations!!! It spoilt our whole weekend, no sleep on both nights and I feel disgusted that it wasn't taken seriously."
61,832,"Jan 21 2009 	Have stayed in better	We were attending a conference which was at the hotel so I compared the direct prices with other hotels around. They turned out to be quite competative so I took the plunge and booked direct. What I failed to notice was that the prices did not include VAT. Never mind as that was the least of the worries. The initial room that we were given can only be described as Tired, which was suprising for a hotel in this chain and location. Avoid room 608 as it is close enough to the workings of the lifts that they keep you awake all night with a constant &quot;whirring&quot; noise. The bathroom door did not close, and I do like my privacy! Lastly there had obviously at some point been an issue with access to the room, the door had clearly been forced and had damaged the wall. Repairs were very crude. I did not feel to safe.We then moved to another room on the 4th floor, which was much nicer than the first,but still not what you would expect, but we did get a good nights sleep. Breakfast was included and not too bad although I have had better. Not sure that I would rush to stay again as there are so many hotels within the immediate area that in my opinion are nicer."
62,832,"Jan 7 2009	OK for one night but chaotic breakfast	In the end I got a good rate booking directly via the hotel website with breakfast included after trawling though loads of hotels on lastminute.com.The room was as expected - clean &amp; comfortable with a basic bathroom. Our room was on the 6th floor. The lifts objected to more than 3 people &amp; we had to get out twice as the overweight sign came on!Breakfast was chaotic - I can understand that 9am is a busy time but surely this must happen every day &amp; shouldn't be a surprise to the hotel. Lots of people were getting up from their tables to accost harassed staff to ask for things - spoons, more tea &amp; coffee, jam, butter, when would pastries be available etc. I must say the staff were patient &amp; helpful but it did not make for a relaxed breakfast experience. Avoid the seriously watered down orange juice!The overall experience at the Holiday Inn Bloomsbury is better, but our stay was OK for what we paid."
63,832,"Jan 5 2009 	Good Value	We Booked two Rooms one using PC points one paid. Had comfirmation of rooms to be upgraded to executive rooms. Got a good rate for the paid Room 119.00 incl. Breakfast for two. Rooms per profile away from lift. Reception staff very efficient and had every thing correct. Food in resteraunt as expected from a Holiday in, that is basic and wholesome. Breakfast buffet was more than ample and fried eggs prepared for you!. In all a pleasant change, and suprisingly much more service orientated than the gruops flagship hotel in Hamilton place Park Lane."
64,832,"Dec 29 2008 	Not worth the money and watch out for the elevator	My husband and I booked this hotel after a good experience the night before at another Holiday Inn in Nottingham. We asked them to book us a Holiday inn near the St Pancras station as we had a very early Train to catch the next morning. The price was very expensive at 160 pounds, but we thought it would be at least as nice as the one we stayed in, so it wouldn't be too bad. And it was London...We were wrong! They got the booking wrong and had us in a twin room, (happened a few times on our trip so no worries) Rang them and we had to go back down and get another key, we ended up with a room (604 I think), which shared a wall with the smaller elevator which was the noisiest elevator I have ever heard. We went down for dinner on the town and got in the large elevator, very scarey, moved and shaked all over the place, and didn't use it again!We came back for an early night, as we lay down we heard the elevator groaning and creaking so loudly we lay there for the next three ours until it finally stopped being used. We wanted to call and complain but we were so tired we didn't want to think about moving everything to another room. We were glad it wasn't a Saturday night and it didn't go all night!We'd booked a wake up call and asked to book a taxi for us, but that ended up being a &quot;transfer&quot; to the station which was a flat rate about 10 pounds more than the taxi fare was (because he had the meter running!), which they told us when we were downstairs and it was already there. Felt very ripped off. I assume there was a cost to book a taxi, but not that much! The room itself was very old and worn out really, carpets were lifting and stretched so they moved when we wheeled the suitcase over it, everything needed a tidy up. We should have looked ourselves and got a backpackers for about the same quality but cost much less. This hotel was the worst one (in value for money terms) in our 4 week trip but also the most expensive and we stayed in everything from a backpackers in Singapore to the Sheraton in Edinburgh! If it was about 100 pounds I probably wouldn't mind so much but when they're charging that price, it's not worth it."
65,832,"Dec 21 2008 	Dirty towels	One of the face towels in my bathroom was heavily stained and it was disgusting. Its a good thing I had brought my own towels. See attached photo. Also, around noon of the second day of my stay, one of the house keeping ladies suddenly invaded my room to check if the beds were done, after giving me about 2 seconds notice following her knocking on the door. The beds were already done anyway. Overall the hotel is ok but fails to impress. At the price they charge you have a wide choice of hotels in the area and I believe this is something they should take into consideration."
