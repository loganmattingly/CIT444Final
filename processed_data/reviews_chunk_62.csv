18,1495,"Sep 2 2008 	Great location below average room.	Stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Downtown Montreal for Labor Day weekend. Room was below average. Here's the pros and cons:Pros: close to Metro, Chinatown, Latin Quarters, McGill College, Old Montreal, Catherine Street.Cons: No safe, no fridge, very small (13 inch) TV, shower knob is FLOOR LEVEL so you have to bend over in the shower to adjust water, coffeemaker in the bathroom! ([--]!), no mouthwash or toothpaste, no free parking, small rooms with low ceilings."
19,1495,Sep 1 2008 	Small rooms good location	The hotel is quite nicely located - near McGill University and Mont Royal. Old Montreal is a nice walk away. The room (especially the bathroom) was quite small and a bit old. The hotel only offers valet parking at about $20 a night.
20,1495,"Aug 22 2008 	The definition of Average	I stayed here with a friend for 3 nights. It was clean and well-kept. The location was good, not great. There was nothing of note either good or bad. We were able to walk downhill to the train station. It wasn't that far and wasn't that close! We took a cab there from the airport so I don't know about the parking. If you are looking for a clean, reasonably-priced, no-frills place to stay downtown, I would recommend the Courtyard by Marriott"
21,1495,"Jul 18 2008 	Great Location Good Price	I stayed here for 5 nights, had a great time. The hotel was absolutely clean and nice, the rooms were big and clean as well. When i had booked the room i had requested for certain things like extra towels, pillows...etc...and to my surprise when i checked in my bed was full of pillows. Also i reached there way before the usual check in time but the staff was nice and didn't make a big deal. Location was great, the metro and buses are easily accessible, St. Catherine Street is just blocks away. Overall a great hotel just don't expect it to be one of the fancy kind. Definitely worth it if you don't want to spend too much on lodging."
22,1495,"Jul 11 2008 	Nice hotel great location	We were lucky to get this hotel at the very last minute during Montreal Jazz Festival. We stayed for 5 nights at a pretty good value. The hotel is located down the street from McGill University and within walking distance of many great restaurants. Rooms were a little dated, but were clean and very comfortable. The hotel offers free wireless internet which is always a plus. The staff was courteous although we had very little interaction with them once we checked in. The only problem we encountered was that one of the two guest elevators was out of order for the first couple of days. After it was fixed, we didn't have to wait long to get an elevator. Overall, a good value."
23,1495,"Jul 8 2008 	Great Good Location	This is my second stay in this hotel. This time we stayed for 3 nights. The king sized bed was very comfortable. We love the great and varied breakfast spread each morning. There were cookies at the frontdesk in the afternoon, which were yummy. On Sports night, there were also snacks in the breakfast area. All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful, from front desk to maintenance to cleaning etc. Would go back again. Thumbs up overall..."
24,1495,"Jun 11 2008 	Great location	Found an incredible deal through Quebec's tourism website and booked a 5 night stay at the Marriott. The site next door was under construction (new Holiday Inn?) but there wasn't too much noise. Got a free room upgrade to a suite when I checked in (nice surprise!) and really enjoyed having the extra sitting room and space. Nice gym on the top floor, and the room was clean and comfortable. The location is perfect, right on Sherbrooke, very close to McGill, about 10 min to the Musee des Beaux Arts and well within walking distance of Rue St. Laurent and Rue St. Catherine."
25,1495,"May 31 2008 	Good Value	I stayed at the hotel on Memorial Day weekend for two nights. It's a standard Marriott hotel with the standard setup. We got a great deal by using the Sweetheart Deal (check their website). The best parts of the hotel: 1. good location - centrally located so you can walk everywhere, or take the nearby metro if you need to. 2. good value - check the website, we got the 2nd night at 50% off.The worst parts:1. There is construction going on on the buildings on both sides of the hotel. Wasn't really a big problem though. 2. Tiny bathrooms."
26,1495,"May 30 2008	Marriot Courtyard - Montreal	The Montreal Marriot Courtyard has a excellent location in downtown Montreal. It is an older property and unlike the vast spaces that are expected, the hotel has a no frills - straight to business - attitude about it. The reception at the left and the miniscule lobby leads to the lift. The rooms are large and well lit.Wifi all over is a great asset for the business traveller. The beds are clean and comfortable. The management was prompt in sending up a fridge when requested. The coffee machine did not heat up the water.The price was a bit on the higher side. At $135 per night it was certainly high. Would have been fair if it included breakfast.Overall experience was average, but given the location, it was worth the price. Do look up the Tourisme Montreal site, they have additional discounts and interesting gifts."
27,1495,"May 30 2008 	Great Location-Service Iffy	The property is in a great location on Sherbrooke and an easy walk downhill to the Bay and downtown shops and nightlife. The concern I have with the property is the iffy service. The check in process with the front desk is pretty painful. They don't really understand English very well, which makes for a communication barrier from the very beginning. The front desk agent I had (female) tried to make the check-in process so quick it seemed like a fast food counter. She really did not listen to my questions or my needs. When I later asked for directions to the airport, I got the same vibe. The feeling you get is that they do not wish to speak to their customers.If the property could fix its front desk accumen, it would be a much better property."
28,1495,"May 23 2008 	Avoid!	1) When I checked in the clerk tired to give me a higher room rate. I had different rates for the 4 days but the clerk adamantly said my rate was the higher rate for all 4 days. Even on her check in card the rate written correctly displaying what I was saying. Even after explaining to her she did not agree to the rate and went in another room and spoke to somebody and came with the same higher rate for all 4 days and now she had scratched the lower rate from her card. Thankfully I remembered that I had printed my hotel receipt at home and packed it. I had to fish that receipt out of my luggage. Finally only after showing that I got the rate that I was entitled to on the first place.2)There is only Valet Parking at this hotel. On 8th May 2008 I went down to get breakfast (around 7:45 am), and saw my car parked in the lobby. I was concerned since I had not called my car; the Valet brings the car to the front entrance at the request of the client. When I spoke to the concierge they brushed me saying it must be a mistake. I am skeptical though and wondering whether my car was being used illegally without my permission."
29,1495,"Apr 18 2008 	Outdated but great staff	This hotel is a little outdated. The wall paper and ceiling could use a fresh coat of paint. I visited a Novotel and really enjoyed the flat screen televisions on the wall. I think this was a good advantage compared to the televisions provided in the room. I found it to be too small even compared with Holiday Inns that I have stayed at. It is not that I stayed and watched television my entire stay but it was nice to have that option in the evenings before bed. The room felt cramped with the size of the furniture in the room.However, the staff at this hotel was absolutely wonderful and provided excellent tourist information. Kudos! For the price and location, this hotel was good."
30,1495,"Mar 31 2008	Good location and price	For the summer, this was a good deal for the location. There's limited parking however so you have to pay them to valet it. There's a good size pool on the top floor with a good view, and it's walking distance to shopping and dining all around. The rooms felt like what we paid for, as far as decor and cleanliness- not really above average or anything."
31,1495,"Jan 5 2008 	Great Hotel	We were on the 24th floor for 3 nights (Fri-Mon) in mid Sept 2007. Paid $104.50 (room rate) + $21.52 (Taxes &amp; service fees) = $126.06 CAD per night for 2 Queen beds plus complimentary continental breakfast. Room was clean, spacious. Bed was comfortable. Concierge (Simon) was very helpful. You get a voucher to give to the waiter when you go for the Continental breakfast. The voucher includes gratuity so you do not have to tip at breakfast. Continental breakfast included the pastries, muffins, make-your-own-waffle, scrambled eggs, bacon, hash brown, orange juice, coffee etc. Beware of taxi drivers gouging you (it only costs $35 flat rate to go from a downtown hotel to airport). The driver tried to overcharge us thinking we do not speak French. You do not need to know French in Montreal. Most people are bilingual, including hotel staff. Hilton Garden Inn is being built right next to the hotel &amp; is slated for completion next year. We stayed on a weekend so there was no construction noise going on. Ask for a room on a higher floor if you want to minimize construction noise during weekdays. The only complaint about this hotel is that the bathroom was too small. There is enough counter space, good water pressure, but the size of the washroom was tiny. When the door is opened it covered half of the bathtub. Otherwise, it is a great hotel. There is a computer in a small room in the lobby that has free internet access for guests.Traveler's Tip: Just around the corner is rue St. Catherine where you can hang out or shop. Nightlife in Montreal is incredible. There are countless coffee shops, one after another.Visit St. Joseph Cathedral. Admission is by donation. This grand cathedral is located on a hill. There's limited or almost no parking in Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal) so take a taxi. Biodome was fun. There's an animal zoo world for 4 seasons. Book a day trip to Quebec City by Grayline Tour (800-461-1223). It's a 3 hour drive from Montreal on a big Greyhound bus. The tour guide gives a history about the city &amp; then you have time to wander on your own. It was great."
32,1495,"Nov 30 2007 	Location Location Location	We stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend and enjoyed our stay. The hotel is not plush...limited amenities but the rooms are comfortable and clean..no view to speak of! They have a bar/restaurant/pool and spa...all of which we were too busy enjoying Montreal to use!The Montreal tourism website advertised a Sweet Deal with a list of participating hotels..most of which told me they could not offer me the deal since it was limited...? Finally the Marriott Courtyard was able to accomodate me! The deal gave us a discounted rate for the first night and half price for every other night...and a bag of goodies on check in! Nice pkg for a nice stay.The Concierge was very helpful and the location is within a sshort walking distance of the Underground, McGill and restaurant row."
33,1495,"Oct 27 2007 	Not my cup of tea	I booked this hotel after reading the reviews. I definitely don't agree with a lot of them. Our room was tiny and the bathroom was dirty and really small. The hotel needs major renovations. The staff were all very friendly and the location is great, but with the dollar being so weak this hotel should have been much cheaper. I would not go back or recommend it to any of my friends. For a few dollars more we could have stayed in a much nicer and cleaner hotel. Also the elevators were quite dangerous cause they closed so fast and barely gave you enough time to get on and off."
34,1495,"Oct 12 2007 	Great location friendly staff	This was a nice place to spend a weekend in downtown Montreal. The weather wasn't the greatest when we were there, but the kids enjoyed to swimming pool on the top floor of the hotel. Nice views of the city from the 26th floor. The valet parking was efficient, as long as they got their 15 minute warning, the car was ready when you came down to the lobby. The staff were helpful and very courteous. The rooms were clean and quiet. The bath tub was starting to show it's age, but was clean. We didn't have problems with the construction next door as we were there on a weekend and no one was working.The location was great for site seeing, shopping and getting on the Metro to go wherever you wanted in the city."
35,1495,Sep 11 2007 	Good price	We recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for a weekend. There was a half price deal with hotels.com which made it worthwhile. Rooms very clean and reasonably large. Friendly and helpful staff. Full buffet breakfast was very nice and had a good selection of hot and cold items. Walking distance to old montreal as well as downtown shopping. I would def stay there again with the same deal...not entirely sure if I woul have been as happy had we paid full price for the room! In room movies cost about $13 plus tax. They offer in room free wireless but the coverage was pretty poor - we only got 1 bar out of 5. Eventually managed to connect but took a while.
36,1495,"Sep 4 2007 	Watch out for constructions	Last week I stayed at the hotel for a week on business. Located conveniently to local shopping district within walking distance (Saint Catherine ST) Supermarket within one block distance. Close by college McGrill. Safe area with just some harmless homeless guys on streets. Staff is friendly all around from the maid to the valet parking attendant to the reception guys. Allow 10 min for valet parking to bring your car. Room was clean on the suite. Avoid the restaurant, food is not expensive but not so great neither, definitely not up to the Marriott standards. You can get better quality food outside at about the same price. One thing that was unavoidable is the construction of the new hotel right next door. If you are a light sleeper avoid at all cost. Hammering and banging from Monday to Friday 7:30 am to 4:00 pm."
37,1495,"Aug 29 2007 	Loved the location.	This hotel is clean, the rooms large and it is in a good location. You can walk one block to the train station. We bought a three day pass for the train and it was well worth it. The hotel people are very helpful for directions. You will pay $17.00 + tax. REMEMBER: The taxes here are very high and the dollar rate is almost even. I think we paid close to $30.00 in taxes for our hotel per day."
38,1495,"Aug 25 2007 	Great Location great service highly recommended	We had a great stay for the night, there is nothing bad to say about this hotel.Location is fantastic close to the old Quebec town and walking distance of pretty mcuh everything.The personnel was delightful, the room to perfection.My 65 year old dad did not even hear the thunder at night, was he was sleeping so well.Very nice and authentic. I recommend !!"
39,1495,"Aug 24 2007 	Nice Hotel. Will return	We stayed at this hotel for three nights. There was a special rate of $99/night, so the pricing was fabulous. The room itself was nice. There were two double beds, a night stand, business desk, dresser drawers and color TV. The beds were very comfortable and clean. White duvets are used as the linen and they were very comfortable. The business desk had ample space for a laptop and its own chair. The color TV was not that big (maybe 20 in.) and had English and French cable channels. The carpet was fine, too. However, the bathroom could have used a little touching up. It wasn't dirty, but showing its age, e.g., a noticeable chip on the mirror.As for the hotel itself, it is centrally located in downtown Montreal. You can walk to Rue St. Catherine's, the Old Port and Chinatown. There are a few metro stops, including the large McGill one, nearby, too. We used the valet parking ($17/day) and walked or took the metro everywhere. The staff were all accommodating and bilingual. The lobby is not huge, but it is well-maintained. The business center only has one computer and it was usually occupied. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again. HOWEVER, there is major construction going on right next door to the hotel. The workers start early and finish late. Therefore, if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room facing Sherbrooke. But, you still may be able to hear the work being done. The noise didn't really bother us, but you will definitely be aware of the work going on."
40,1495,"Aug 15 2007 	Great Experience	I read some reviews that said this hotel was tired, but when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find it immaculate and looking very fresh. I spent 7 nights in this hotel and have absolutely no complaints. The beds were comfortable, the rooms big enough, and everything was spotless! We did have trouble getting through to room service one night, but other than that, everything was perfect. I would recommend this hotel highly."
41,1495,"Aug 11 2007 	Rooms outdated	Was disappointed with the room. The room was dated, with poor air quality.The front desk, front-end help were very helpful.This hotel is conviently located and within walking distance to many of the attractions etc.I most likely with try another hotel before returning here."
42,1495,"Aug 10 2007 	Loved the Marriott	Just returned from Montreal and a 2 night stay at this hotel. Location was excellent, close to shopping and restaurants, rooms clean and the staff was courteous, helpful and very friendly. Had dinner and breakfast at the hotel restaurant - both meals were delicious. Would definitely stay there again."
43,1495,"Jul 27 2007	Must have had a bad room!	Due to the mainly positive reviews the Courtyard has received as well as my general satisfaction with the Marriot brand I am willing to entertain the possibility that I just got a bad room. Room seemed old and dated. Not dirty, but not that fresh and clean feel. Not old as in stately and victorian, but old as in the Three's Company apartment. Decent location, one block from the subway, but just not warm, comfortable and welcoming like so many other Courtyard's. If I return to Montreal I will book a room elsewhere."
44,1495,Jul 18 2007 	Good hotel for business and pleasure	Stayed here for work meeting. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Nice large space for meetings. Lunches were good too - each day we had three options to choose from plus salad bar. Location is perfect - lots to do in the area. Only blocks away from St. Laurent and St. Catherine Streets. Sleeping rooms were clean.
45,1495,"Jul 9 2007 	Outstanding	Excellent hotel in perfect location. The room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. Staff members were courteous and pleasant without exception. No complaints at all. I'd stay there again."
46,1495,"Jul 2 2007	The Friendly people and the clean streets of Montreal	Hi,Me and my family just came from having a wonderful time in Montreal. We visited the oldest catholic church. The art gallory row. The Biosphere, Botantical Gardens, Observatory Tower, the beach (although man made was nice). The Fine Arts musem was awesome. We went to the jazz festival and was just blown away by the different types of music and dance.We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott and was a little apprehensive after reading the reviews online, but the hotel and staff was simply marvelous. Rene gave us suggestions on what to visit and direct directions on how to get there. He came by everyday to see how we had enjoyed where went and then would make suggestions for more places. All his suggestions were dead on the spot. I have not had such great customer service in a long time. The Courtyard staff are to be commend. The resturant food was excellent. We even enjoyed the swimming pool where our children placed Marco Polo. The rooms were clearn and roomy enough for the 4 of us. So I have no complaints about this hotel or its service. I would highly recommend this hotel to all.We went to eggspectations and the food was delicous and homemade. The service again was awesome.The people in Canadian were so very friendly. If you looked like you were lost someone would come over to help you.If you ever visit Montreal. Look up Rene at the Courtyard Marriot, you can not beat his customer service anywhere!"
47,1495,"Jun 5 2007 	Just unlucky I guess . . .	Everyone else seems to have had no problems here, but my stay was a bit difficult. I arrived well after midnight, and had expected, from prior experience at Courtyard by Marriott properties, to be able to grab a soda and some chips or crackers from the lobby store. When I finished check-in and mentioned to the desk clerk that I was going to get a snack, he informed me that the store was closed, without offering any alternative suggestions or even an apology. Upon arriving in my room, the first thing that greeted me was a letter on the desk from the general manager apologizing for the noise and inconvenience from the construction site next door, explaining that the hotel had no control over this. Upon entering the bathroom, I discovered that it was so small that the counter extended over the toilet, so that the only way to sit on it was with my elbow on the counter and my leg under it, with the edge of the counter in my ribs. The next morning, I spent several minutes attempting to adjust the temperature in the shower. I finally got in anyway, and discovered that the temperature continued to vary randomly by 60-80 degrees throughout, even when I didn't touch the controls.I didn't actually have a problem with noise from the construction, but I did return to my room at the end of the work day the first day to find that housekeeping had missed making up my room.The problem with the shower continued throughout my stay, but otherwise things settled down after that. The room itself was acceptable -- about what I'd expected. Room service food from the Italian restaurant downstairs was at least average.I probably wouldn't stay here again unless it were the only available option at a reasonable price -- I've been in several other hotels in downtown Montreal that were better at comparable or lower prices."
48,1495,"May 9 2007 	Clean Rooms - Excellent Service	Sure, it may look dated from the outside, but inside this hotel has done a good job of keeping up with the times. I don't know what some people expect when they visit a hotel that isn't billed as &quot;luxury accomodations&quot;, but this is as good as it gets when you're traveling on a budget and are simply looking for a good quality hotel.I'll break this down like I do with most of my reviews.PARKING:Valet parking was about $16/day. We had no problems retrieving our vehicles upon request by simply giving the front desk a 10-15 minute lead time.ROOM:On this occassion I was traveling with several friends and we rented more than one room. All the rooms were spacious, well-kept, clean, stocked, and nicely furnished.BEDS:The beds were clean and comfortable, even with my often-temperamental back. The sheets were of better quality than your average hotel and there were plenty of pillows.NOISE:Nothing unusual. Even as a light sleeper i was fine at this hotel.FRONT DESK:With the medium size group we were traveling with we often had to communicate with the front desk. The staff was always very friendly, helpful and accomodating. From calling cabs, giving directions and recommendations, to assisting us with our luggage and providing us with umbrellas on a particularly rainy morning, these guys always came through for us.It should also be noted here that there was NO issue at all with the fact that we were english-speaking Americans in a french-speaking Canadian hotel.LOCATION:The hotel was easy to find, right up the street from McGill University in the middle of downtown, walking distance to everything. We rarely had resort to using our vehicles to travel.RESTAURANT:It looked nice but we never ate there, so I can't comment.STORE:The hotel store is nothing more than a few shelves of goods near the front desk. However, there were several small shops, bodegas and mini-marts nearby.GYM:Never saw it, so I can't comment.POOL:Never saw it, so I can't comment.INTERNET:Hi speed wireless internet was provided free of charge. We had no problems accessing or using it."
49,1495,"Apr 30 2007 	Met Expectations	Stayed Saturday night at the Courtyard Marriott in Downtown Montreal. For my short stay, it met all of my expectations. Pleasant staff, nice size room especially for a large city, safe, clean, and in a central location. A little dated but not bad and the 9 rooms that they advertise per floor does give it that boutique feel. I definitely wouldn't hesitate to stay here again when returning to Montreal. At night they have someone at the front checking for everyone's room key before letting them go further. My only complaint is that they advertise free wireless in the room but I was unable to connect. When I called about it they advised me that the room only has wired access. They did offer to bring me a cable and also suggested the business center if I needed to go online. Although I would have liked to use my PDA to check emails in the room I like that they didn't stop at just saying no....and suggested alternatives. The subway is a few blocks away and an easy walk. From there, Rue Crescent is only two stops down. Ran out of time and only got to drive through Old Montreal and take some pictures so really can't comment on how easy it is to reach via walking or subway."
50,1495,"Jan 2 2007 	Excellent service normal rooms	My friends and I stayed here for New Year's 2007. It is surrounded by other major hotel chains (Holiday Inn, Four Points, Quality Hotel, etc). The restaurant is expensive and worse than the independent places outside or the Holiday Inn bar. The pool is standard hotel size with a rather small jacuzzi. That and the fitness center are located on the top floor giving you a great view of the city. It is unfortunate that they did not have a steam room to complete the amenities. You are 2 blocks from the Metro, a 5-minute walk to the malls and about a 20-minute brisk walk to Crescent (or an $8 cab ride); the same for other historical sites. Even though Montreal was experiencing a warm period during our stay, it was still too cold to walk there and tiring - especially after exploring around for a few hours during the day. This is an inconvenience. But the hotel is right near McGill and the park - which can be a very relaxing walk when it's daylight out. The service at the hotel would probably be the best part. Everyone is courteous and prompt. There were no problems with the bill, and anythign we asked to be sent up (cups, towels, bottle openers) were done so within 5 minutes of our request. The concierge was extremely helpful in making New Year's reservations and storing our bags. Our request for an early check-in was honored at noon versus their regular time of 3pm.The rooms are clean and normal-size, as are the bathrooms. The TV can use some updating and the programming is limited (not that it should matter). There was no safe in our room but we left our passports, cameras and iPods when we went out and everything was in place when we got back. Bottom line: I would recommend this hotel."
51,1495,"Dec 15 2006 	Great hotel	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in November. It was more pleasant than expected. The room was clean, location was great, and the swimming pool/jacuzzi on the top floor with a city view were a nice touch. The only problem was with parking since it does take valet about 10-15 minutes to bring the car up. But all we needed to do was call in ahead of time. Staff was very friendly. We would stay in this hotel again."
52,1495,"Nov 1 2006	Better Than Springhill Suites	I had a not-great stay at Springhill Suites and bolted for this Courtyard. Good move. Much nicer and better-run. Very efficient and friendly staff, good services, good price, and the location's just off of the charming old montreal area, there's LOTS right here (chinatown within walking distance, and St-Laurent just a bit further). Even better if you have car...you can easily get anywhere from here.Big big pool (laps!) and clean jacuzzi on top floor with stupendous views. Good workout room. Friendly bartender. And I was upgraded to an extremely nice suite (far larger/nicer than even the larger suites at Springhill Suites).The big problem is parking. The valet must have to go miles to park your car...it consistently took 10 mins to recoup vehicle. Learn to call down to valet in advance from your room."
53,1495,"Oct 24 2006 	Just another hotel	I agree with other reviewers who found that this hotel is decent but in need of renovation. I got a reasonable rate for one night on the Marriott website and it was more reasonable than other hotels nearby, which is why I stayed there. The location is excellent as it is near Rue St. Catherine, metro stops and the&quot;ville interieure&quot;. It is hardly luxurious (the bathroom was so small that when I leaned over to dry off from the shower I hit my head on the door!) but all things considered it is acceptable in most respects. You get what you pay for, so if price is in issueI do recommend it."
54,1495,Oct 7 2006 	not luxury but nice	we stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and it was 8 of us traveling. the rate for their suite was great so we booked 4 suits because we did not want to share rooms. they had only 1 suite per floor so we were in different floors which was not a problem. the staff were friendly and their duty manager karimi was a gentleman. the suite were really big and each had separate bedroom. the bathroom was nice and the livingroom was big too. the location of the hotel is wonderful and within walking distance to everywhere. I'vebeen to Montreal again and I think for the price this hotel is good. it is not a luxury property but clean and central location with nice staff. if you are looking for a better taste and a modern hotel you should try Loews Hotel Vogue which is wonderful with great location. Also you can't go wrong by staying at Ritz Carlton.
55,1495,"Oct 5 2006 	A Great Hotel!	My wife and I have stayed numerous times at this hotel. It's not as luxurious as the Omni, but the rooms are large, clean, and the service is excellent. I would definetly recommend this hotel."
56,1495,"Aug 4 2006 	Will definitely go back!	We just came back from a 6-night stay and loved it! As a family of four with two younger children (ages 7 and 11), we booked the King mini suite (to allow the grown ups some privacy), which has a separate king-size bedroom and an additional sofa in the living area. This is a relatively small hotel, which we loved as it feels more personal and intimate without taking away from the quality of the services. The rooms were spacious and very clean. Location is GREAT - walking distance to everything. Service was absolutely great - very nice, helpful staff, eager to help. We often used their pool, which is average size (for a hotel in a city) and very clean. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel (so many great breakfast places around). We stay at quite a few hotels as a family and are quite picky about what we want for service and quality, and this was absolutely a success. We also met quite a few families and couples at the hotel that have been returning guests and told us the same things. We are definitely going back!"
57,1495,"Jul 5 2006 	We enjoyed this Marriot	We just returned from a four night stay at this hotel and really enjoyed it. True, this is not top-of-the-line for Marriot, so there is no chocolate on your pillow. We had a room on the 24th floor with a view of downtown Montreal. The best part of the room was the beds. They had high thread count linens, a comfy duvet and five pillows on each bed. We slept well. There also was a comfortable chair with ottoman--perfect for reading the morning paper. There was a nearby floor lamp with a place to park your coffee cup. The ice machine was just outside our door, but we never heard it run unless someone was getting ice, so the noise lasted just a few seconds. The reception area was warm and inviting with marble floors and dark wood paneling. This area was decorated with large photographs of Montreal taken in the 19th century. The staff was warm and friendly. On the 26th floor was an exercise room with five or six pieces of equipment. Next to it was a guest laundry with a newer washer and dryer. We used the swimming pool and the hot tub, also on the 26th floor. That room had great views of Montreal and Mont Royal Park. The subway was around the corner and down the block. We enjoyed our stay."
58,1495,"Jun 3 2006 	Good hotel fair enough location	The hotel is a good enough hotel if you can get it at a reasonable price. I got the breakfast included package at a good price!The good points :1. Huge rooms (bigger than most I have been in, and I travel a lot!)2. Free internet that works well.3. Nice breakfast4. Location that is about 4 to 5 minutes walking to the main shopping and happening street Rue Peel.The okay or may need improvement points:1. Staff is rarely smiling2. The rom service happens very late in the day at around 1 pm or so!So all in all, if you need a real big room in a location that is just about okay and walkable to most places, this aint a bad choice"

1,1503,Nov 4 2009 	Ok place to stay	close to airport and easy access to downtown. very clean and staff is very helpfull. Good Wi Fi included and good breakfast included in price. Parking at $9 per day is excessive. Overall an OK place to stay short term. a bit too expensive compared to comparable hotels in the area. Hard to access if you are not familiar with the ridiculous traffic circle within a traffic circle road set up. The city of Dorval and the airport authority really need to get it together and try to make things user friendly re signage &amp; access. It's Montreal so don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen.
2,1503,"Sep 16 2009 	Great night sleep for early morning flight.........	The elevator was not working for a short amount of time and staff carried our luggage up seven flights of stairs,worked fine in the morning..I was concerned about the noise factor I had read about,apparently they added extra windows. We were on the 7th floor ,train station side. I am a light sleeper and did not have any problems with noise. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff friendly and accommodating.The breakfast starts officially at 630am but we were able to eat at 6am as we needed to get to the airport. The food was good and plentiful.I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again. Seems easier to get to from the airport than going to airport."
3,1503,"Sep 6 2009 	Very close to the Airport but hard to access/Prs de l'aroport mais difficile d'accs	My experience with this hotel didn`t start on a good note to say the least. At -25 degrees, we could see the hotel from the highway, but how to get to it? Geez, we circled around the hotel along time before being able to find the right path to it.Once we reached it, I was surprised to see these nice large rooms for the price I was paying. It is very close to the Airport, obviously.When I chose an hotel close to the airport, my expectations are not too high as I am usually spending only one night there to catch an early flight. We got in the shuttle the next morning on time for our flight.What I really liked about this place are the room. Modern, large, which is convenient when you are travelling with young children./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Mon exprience avec cet htel n'a pas commenc sur une bonne note. Nous avons tourn autour de l'htel un bon 45 minutes avant de trouver la bonne rue pour y accder, et ce malgr le fait que nous pouvions voir l'htel depuis l'autoroute,  -25 degrs.Une fois trouv, j'ai t agrablement surpris de l'endroit pour le prix que je payais. Ce que j'ai aim le plus, ce sont les chambres, qui taient spacieuses, ce qui est trs important lorsque nous voyageons avec les enfants. Je n'ai pas beaucoup d'attente lorsque je couche dans les &quot;Htels-aroports&quot; car nous y demeurons habituellement seulement une nuit avant de prendre notre vol tt le lendemain. Il y avait une navette tt le matin qui nous a permis d'arriver  temps pour notre vol."
4,1503,"Aug 20 2009 	Fine hotel	Stayed here on a local business trip. I loved the decor. Shower built for two was a nice touch : ) I had a hard time getting to it since it's on a one-way street, but otherwise it was fine."
5,1503,"Jul 17 2009 	Very convenient	New place with spacious rooms and a small cafe (soup, pizza, natchos etc) and bar. Continental breakfast the usual plus waffles. Excellent location very visable from the 20 and very close to the airport."
6,1503,"Jun 25 2009 	convenient good service but not a great hotel	Good: spacious, comfortable rooms, wireless internet access, convenient location, very helpful service at breakfast (even accommodating us when we showed up for breakfast just as they were closing down)Not so good: rooms on the back get a lot of noise from the highway and train; parking lot was not well plowed and once we had to dig out a space before parking the car; hard to find in the maze of ramps around the airport -- needs better signage to get you there (tip: cut through the parking lot of the Best Western); housekeeping miscue (because we checked in late in the evening, our room was left off the list for housekeeping to clean and make up, so it wasn't made up after our first night, but the housekeeping manager came and personally apologized"
7,1503,"Jun 19 2009 	Perfect Stopover hotel	I spent one night at the Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites Montreal Airport in early May before catching an early morning flight. The hotel is brand new, very modern, room rates include breakfast and has free shuttle service over to the airport every 30 minutes. No complaints whatsoever, I would definitely stay again."
8,1503,"May 5 2009 	Bargain for a clean new hotel	When I booked this hotel there were very few reviews and most just explaining how complicated it was to arrive. We were lucky enough that I programed our GPS and found it no problem, though I can see how if you didnt have one it may be an issue. If you don't mind a bit of a drive to the city centre this is your best bet. The hotel was lovely, everything was new and very clean. The breakfast buffet had a nice array of options and the pool was warm and fun for a dip at night. We had no complaints over all and am planning to return in a few months for my next visit to Montreal."
9,1503,"Feb 12 2009 	Great Hotel!!	We stayed at this hotel because we had an early morning flight and were coming from Ottawa. The most important thing was that we needed a 24 hour shuttle because we had to be at the airport at 3:45 and this hotel has that. Great shuttle service!The hotel itself is really nice. Very new. The rooms are great - very comfy beds, nice big bathrooms with great amenities, nice tvs. We had dinner and drinks in the bar/lounge in the lobby and the food was delicious! And they provide breakfast the next morning. We weren't going to be there when they served breakfast so they provided a boxed breakfast for us to pick up on our way out of the hotel!They also provide a &quot;park and stay&quot;. So we left our vehicle there for the duration of our trip. I would definitely stay here again if I needed an overnight stay at the Montreal Airport!"
10,1503,"Jan 21 2009 	Very Nice Property but hard to get too!	Great hotel. Brand new with very nice rooms. Very hard to get to from a tourist point of vue. Even if it is hard to get to, I will stay there again if I go to Montreal. It is a 20 minutes drive to Downtown."
11,1503,"Nov 28 2008 	Great Hotel with Wonderful Staff	NEW HOTEL as of writing (Nov 24 - 26). Best Fairfield I have ever stayed in!! Best hotel staff that I have seen in all of our travels across the world; so friendly and accomodating. Business travelers frequent here quite a bit. Sleek, chic bright hotel located off of a roundabout and near a rail line. The trick to getting to the hotel if you are driving is to immediately turn off of the roundabout and turn right into the Best Western parking lot. Go to the left and drive behind the parking lot. This will lead you to the front of the Fairfield. My husband and I drove this roundabout twice until we got it right! Self parking fee of $8 CAD (plus tax) with in-out privileges. If you don't want a room facing the rain line, then say so. We stayed in Room 917 for 2 nights and Loved it. Nice sized room. The beds are comfortable, the halls are well lit and bright and carpet is very clean. The bathroom was very clean, too. There is some airplane noise, but this is an airport hotel. Did not hear the trains from our room, but knew there were communter train tracks next to the hotel. Free Wireless Internet. If you do not bring a laptop, there are 2 computers in the business section for guest use. Enjoyed the unlimited continental breakfast that included bacon, egg and cheese quesadillas and waffles. Breakfast ends at 9:30am. Breakfast area is not busy, but it would depend on when you go to eat breakfast. There are two washers and dryers in the on-site laundry room so you can do your own laundry.Hotel is about 20 minute drive to Centre-ville/Downtown Montreal, located right off of the autoroute/highway. I highly recommend this hotel."
12,1503,"Aug 23 2008	Nice little getaway!	First off, this is a nice little hotel near the Pierre Elliot Trudeau Airport, and right beside the train tracks. The hotel was ready in May 2008, and it's gorgeous. Its still very very clean. My girlfriend and I stayed there for a weekend getaway, and we loved it. As for other reviewers complaining about certain things, here's what we think. Yes, the hotel is a terrible location. The trick to get to the hotel is to cut through the Best Western's hotel parking lot, across the street. AS for noise levels, we had our room facing towards the front side away from the train. We had no problems sleeping, nor could we complain about the outside noise. However, we do suspect that people may have suffered louder noise if their rooms faced the train. Request to have a front faced room, and this will solve your problems. My girlfriend's a light sleeper and she had no problems sleeping.The staff was friendly and helpful (they gave us nice info with places to eat, close by, and they provided a map). Rooms were very clean, and their was even a nice little pool. Also, there was a small workout room too. Continental breakfast was delicious, with the Belgium Waffles. &quot;Come for the Waffles, stay for the beds&quot;.We did have one little problem and that was that the tub didn't drain correctly unless the drain tab was lifted. No biggie, as we used an elastic band to get us through. We're sure the staff would have done something had we mentioned it.Parking was cheap at 6 bucks a day, but we noticed some noise from other patrons, but not much. The rooms are fairly sound proofed, but not completely. None of them really are anyways, regardless of which hotel you stay at.Overall:Pros: -Good rates for clean rooms-Continental Breakfast-Clean pool and workout area-Sturdy Beds-Cheap parking-LCD TV (Where did this come from?!? lol)-Friendly and helpful staffCons:-Terrible location-Hard to find-Eating area is pretty small-Breakfast area ends at 10, and usually has a line"
13,1503,"Aug 21 2008 	Nice new but can be busy. Indoor pool a plus for families.	Booked this hotel after reading the reviews posted here. Most of them are spot-on: the hotel is right next to a major rail line, so make sure your room heating/AC unit is set to &quot;Fan On&quot; if you are a light sleeper, as this will reduce the extra noise when trains roll past.The hotel has an indoor pool - that's something my two kids always prefer, no matter the season. It's smallish but still decent.The free continental breakfast was slightly above average; the usual assortment of breads, cereals, juices, coffee/tea, plus a waffle maker. The hotel was nearly or entirely full during our stay, so the breakfast room was packed 3 of the 5 mornings we were there.The hotel's location is a plus if you're using the airport. If you're instead spending most of your time downtown, the hotel is a tad remote. However, you can leave your car and take public transit ($2.75 per trip as of 8/08) - by catching the 211 or 221 Express bus at the Dorval train station (a 200 ft walk from the hotel) to the Lionel-Groulx Metro stop (Green line) and then taking the Metro into town -- a published trip time of 32 minutes). We only discovered this option on the last day so couldn't take advantage of it. See http://www.stm.info for more details; use the STM trip planner (&quot;Tous Azimuts&quot;...both in English and French) to build a schedule. Both that bus line and metro operate past midnight.Parking costs $8 per day, unlimited in/out privileges. Make sure to have your room key card encoded for parking lot use, or you'll have to request a key code in person every time you want to exit -- that can be a hassle if the front desk is busy.As others have said, the hotel is hard to get to the first time you try -- it's on a one-way street and you merge onto that street just PAST the hotel entrance, so you have to loop around.If you type in '700 Avenue Michel Jasmin&quot; (the hotel's address) into an online map service (Google Maps or the one at the Fairfield website) you can see what I mean; the directions those services provide are accurate.I found the hotel staff overall very helpful. Would stay there again."
14,1503,"Jul 7 2008 	Beautiful property near airport a bit hard to get to	I stayed there to be close to the airport for an early flight on a Monday morning. The property opened in March '08, and it is by far the best Fairfield Inn I've stayed in. The rooms are magnificent, very well kept, and just an all-around beautiful hotel. The location is somewhat hard to get to when driving. The trick is to go to Dorval Avenue back and around over to Michel Jasmin avenue. It's well worth checking out an online map if you're headed to that hotel. [I was a Montreal local for 26 years and it still took my local friend &amp; I over 10 minutes to find the way to get there!]The hotel is of course close to the airport, and in a mostly industrial area, so forget about walking anywhere from that location."
15,1503,"Jun 13 2008 	Great airport hotel.	Stayed here because of airport proximity. Had not previously stayed in a Fairfield and was really impressed by the friendly, helpful staff, the convenient services, and the good value. Facilities were very nice -- I thought the small fitness room was well equipped for this level of hotel. Indoor pool looked well maintained. They provided some good restaurant recommendations and a map to the nearest gas station (not far), but roads are very confusing in that area since there are so many highways coming together. Room was clean, comfortable, and a good size. Cont. breakfast was good, including belgian waffles you can make yourself. My only complaint was the noise from the trains -- quite loud even at the highest floors. I would definitely stay here again."
16,1503,"Jun 6 2008 	A GEM of a hotel in the location from HELL.	Travelling by car, in town two nights to attend a family function.. The location of this brand new hotel was a nightmare. It is situated on the edge of two roundabouts (all signs in french) which facilitate entry to the airport. Please keep in mind that we grew up in this area and are very familiar with the &quot;Dorval Circle&quot; flow of traffic but there are no words to describe how difficult it is get get to this hotel. If I found it a challenge to get to, I cannot begin to imagine what a tourist would go through to get to this location. When we finally did arrive I asked the desk clerk to give me his rendition of directions and if I'd followed his directions I'd still be in the car!! I can't fault him however, because I don't even think I could give directions in this case, it simply defies words. Oh the noise.......This hotel is located directly beside a major train station and freight line. With freight trains passing 200 feet from your room all night don't expect to get any sleep. The hotel itself is brand new, the room was very nice, exceptionally clean and the staff are friendly. No faults there, everything you would expect from a Marriott hotel. (I'd give the hotel itself 4 stars). The rate is quite reasonable however the trade off of location an noise is just not worth the savings. I would have gladly paid an extra $60 per night to get some sleep. Sorry to say but we would recommend giving this GEM a miss."
17,1503,"May 30 2008 	Brand New 	Just stayed there after long flight from Rome. Glad to be back at a Marriott style Hotel. Very kind front desk people. Brand new Hotel, as was less then 2 months old when we stayed. Increadibly clean and good breakfast. 32inch LCD Tv was a bonus. Big rooms and Marriott level bedding which we always appreciate. Watch out as cabs charge a minimum $12 from Airport to about 2km from Airport, a ripoff. Take the shuttle for free. Recommend it as a GREAT STAY."
18,1503,"May 29 2008 	More like a 5 star property	The Fairfield at the Montreal airport is more like a 5 star property than your standard Fairfield. I usually stay at Marriott properties and normally find the Fairfield line a little less expensive but quite sufficient compared to the Courtyard or high rise selections, so I was prepared for the usual Fairfield level of hotel. This particular one was very new and so clean you could eat off the floor if desired. There wasn't a speck of dirt or dust anywhere in the entire hotel and the lobby is quite impressive. Highly recommended."

The location was great (close to major attractions), the room was spacious and inviting, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. On top of that, the quality of the service made our stay very enjoyable."
5,1506,"Sep 2 2009 	A poor choice	I booked this hotel many months ago for a first venture to Montreal as a vacation area. Reviews seemed good at the time, but the hotel was in the process of changing management and brand - THAT SHOUD HAVE BEEN MY FIRST CLUE! Websites did not have all the information needed and calls were necesary, each time the person answering was not able to give information needed, but said someone else would call back. No calls, causing my recall. Third time was the charm and all semed well. Arrived on Sept 1 for a three day stay. This is the beginning of day 2 and all is not well. At check in, the staff at the desk (no one has a name tag) said the room was not ready. We were meeting with friends who were already arrived. Once that was made known, a room, already made up, was available two doors away from theirs. Room seem fine although old style and colors. Six hour later housekping showed up to make up the room - they seem to have no idea what has or has not been done. Bed was fine, view was great! Bathroom was small, in need of repair, and the ground fault interrupter for the hair dryer had to be reset evey 10 seconds of use! I am sorry to say we have two more days of this to look forward to."
6,1506,"Aug 26 2009 	great hotel....very comfy retreat!	I stayed at the Grand Plaza hotel last night, and the manager was super nice! Rooms very modern, beds were comfy,and the hotel extremely quiet....great place to come back to, after a long,noisy day in old Montreal....excellent location...:-)"
7,1506,"Aug 17 2009 	Hot Hot Hot and not the good kind of hot!	I checked in on Friday afternoon, August 14. My room on the 23rd floor was nice. As I requested, except for the fact that it was 78 degrees in it. After a shower, I called the front desk and they moved me to a (smaller) room on the 23rd floor which was still acceptable. After hanging out there for a bit and hoping that it was a matter of time before it cooled down, I check the thermostat and it was 77 degrees. I was sweating. It was a hot weekend in Montreal. Called the front desk again and told them that the AC was simply not working but the front desk would actually not admit that it wasn't working. Eventually I got moved to a &quot;SUITE&quot;. This was their way of hoping to make good for the inconveniences. The suite is actually like an apartment with a kitchenette, dining area, sofa, foyer, etc... not what I needed or wanted but hey, it came with an assurance of being cool. The problem with this room, no WI-FI, but they did give me a cable to connect directly to the LAN which I never did get to work. They gave me a coupon for a free breakfast which was nice of them. I turned the thermostats down to their lowest level and it lacking a digital readout, I'm going to guess that the temperature in the room was 74. The fact that it was on the 3rd floor and not east-facing is what made it cooler. I have to say Laura was very pleasant to deal with. I searched high and low for a decent hotel close to the village for a good rate... I got a good rate... but it wasn't worth the heat! The bed in the room was a metal frame which was once screwed into the wall. The screws have since been completely come out of the wall and the dry-wall dust is sitting on dark blue carpet glaring right up at you when you go to make the bed. Why oh why doesn't housekeeping clean it up? Do not know. Maybe for the same reason that the tray with 6 empty glasses was sitting beside the 3rd floor elevator for 24+ hours. All in all, not a good experience at the Grand Plaza sadly. I was hoping that it was going to become my new favourite hotel while in Montreal. Guess I'm going to have to keep looking."
8,1506,"Aug 4 2009 	Non-Professional staff with little knowledge!	Just go back from staying at this horrific hotel if you can call it that. The place was disgusting the pool was smelly and gross and to top it off the the sheets were ripped and the staff had absolutely zero people skills. Would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone espcially those with children. Word of advise to the hotel, try cleaning the outside windows once in awhile the crud that is building up on the edges are absolutely disgusting!!"
9,1506,"Jul 7 2009 	Grand = NO...Centre-Ville = YES	There is nothing &quot;Grand&quot; about this Grand Plaza Hotel. Don't let picture fool you (maybe you're not fooled to begin with). The hotel, as many reviews have mentioned, has seen better days. The first room we stayed in, the air conditioning didn't work property -- so the room was hot and the a/c made a tapping noise all night. We had to call to move rooms at 1:30am that first night!The pool is gross. The clientele is definitely budget, so keep that in mind if that's not your scene.On the plus side, the hotel is perfectly located to see all of the city -- Rue St Denis is around the corner, and we walked to all other areas -- Musee Beaux Arts, Gay Village, steps to Mont Real, Vieux Montreal. So if location is the name of your game, definitely think about this as a selection. If you were expecting anything Grand in the Grand Plaza, keep on searching."
10,1506,"Jul 5 2009	Across the street from the Metro 	My teenage son &amp; I stayed here when we went to Montreal to see Radiohead. The valet parking drop off area is pretty small, maybe room for 8 cars, but the harried valet was very pleasant &amp; we didn't have to wait long for him to bring us our car back when we checked out. It's seen better days, but the room we got was very comfortable &amp; e had an uneventful stay. St. Denis St with it's cafes is only block or 2 away, but be warned, it's probably one of the most &quot;french&quot; areas, when we sat at one patio, the server had to get someone from the kitchen to speak english with us, that was a first for me in probably 20 visits over the years to Montreal. When I told some local friends where we were staying one commented &quot;You must be brave&quot;, she was referring to the neighbourhood, but my son &amp; I walked all around &amp; never felt any reason to be nervous. Although I had no problems with the hotel, it's location for access to the places I like to be when I'm in Montreal, isn't the best. I'll try to be more central to where I want to be next time. (Booked this on Hotwire, so didn't know exact location or hotel until I'd paid)."
11,1506,"Jul 4 2009 	Amazing value - great for travelers on a budget	This hotel cost us $99 a night, at least $50 less than other hotels in the area. We got a king size bed on the 19th floor with a huge and glorious view of the river.For the money it is hard to do better. The rooms are clean, if a little worn. The beds are very comfortable and the fitness room is very new. The bathrooms are a little spartan, but quite clean.Parking is expensive if u use theirs, but parking around the block is free.Overall, as a cheap, clean, and comfortable home base in an extremely convient location, i dont think u can beat this hotel."
12,1506,"Jun 29 2009 	4-Star? More like 1 -Star!	When my husband and I arrived to the Montreal the hotel was hard to find because of several street closures. Needless to say, that was not under their control. Once we finally reached the hotel, it was 2 hours past check in time at 5:00 PM (check in time was 3:00 PM). We were so exhausted from our 8 hour road trip and were anxious to get to our hotel room only to find out from the unapologetic and rude receptionist that they needed another 20 minutes to get it ready for us! Mind you we had made the reservation over a week in advance and were charged for the hotel right away. We then had no choice but to wait in the reception area and finally 30 minutes later I decided to ask them if the room was ready and luckily it was. But of course they didn't even have the decency to tell us when we were waiting in their lobby in plain sight! Any how, we go to the room to find a tiny room with a broken vent and wall paper peeling off the walls and a tiny bathroom - btw when booking the room we were told that the room will have a King bed however it actually had a queen bed. Any how I go to use the shower to freshen up only to find hair in the shower and a black floor. It was obvious the bathroom was not cleaned. I called house keeping, no answer to no surprise. I had to go downstairs to the reception area again to tell them and finally 30 minutes later the room bathroom was cleaned. My husband and I then leave to go out.We return to the hotel room 3 hours later only to find that ALL OF THE ELEVATORS IN THE HOTEL ARE NOT WORKING!! We were told by the receptionists to either take the stairs (mind you we were staying on the 11th floor!!) or the service elevator. Well my husband and I take the offer to use the service elevator, however we didn't know what was waiting for us in the elevator! In the service elevator was garbage, flies and a used plunger! They didn't even have the decency to clean it for their guests! We finally make it to our hotel room and my husband tries to turn on the TV but the remote doesn't work! We then try to call the front desk from the phone next to our bed and that doesn't work either! My husband then finally uses the other phone in the room to call the front desk only to hear from them that they will come up when they can. Everyone is trying to get the elevators working! Someone finally comes up about 30 minutes later with a new remote. Also, another fair warning it was really hot and humid in Montreal over the weekend we stayed. WE go to turn on the air conditioner and it doesn't seem to work. We go to the front desk only to find out that the hotel has a centralized A/C unit and we cannot adjust it. We were stuck in a hot, muggy hotel all weekend. The stay at this hotel nearly ruined our weekend. They only good thing about the hotel was that it was really close to the Metro so we could leave and get around easily. We even tried to leave the night we got there but everything in the city was booked, so we were stuck. To everyone considering this self proclaimed &quot;4 star&quot; hotel - save your money. It's a piece of crap!"
13,1506,"Jun 27 2009	Grand Plaza - minus the Grand	While this hotel claims to be a 4-Star accomodation, it has a few areas that make you questions the 4th Star... While the hotel room is really big and the bed comfortable (supposedly a Queen, most likely a Full) and the location great next to St. Dennis and the Latin Quarter, the lack and lackluster service coupled with the apparent air conditioning annd water pressure shortage (thermostat reads 62 - in reality more like 78) bring down the ambiance a few notches.For the price we paid for our Business Suite ($84 pre tax per night), it could say that it is worth it . But charge me the regular price - NO WAY!They offer a breakfast buffet in the morning - $14 reg, $10 with AAA discount, but honestly, it's worth skipping. The fruit is unripe, the eggs soggy, the sausage anemic, and the tea pots old and mangled.Bottom line, if it is luxury you are looking for, keep on looking. If a comfortable bed is enough and you can look around its flaws and get a great deal on the room - then it's worth considering."
14,1506,"May 25 2009 	Adequate	This hotel is very shabby, but the location is fantastic. If you get a good rate on line, it's worth a stay. It has a decent little pool and exercise room. I've never eaten in the restaurant - why would you when you are in Montreal, a diner's paradise!? There's a great coffee shop two blocks away for breakfast. There is an entrance to the metro in the hotel, or you can walk 2 or 3 blocks down the hill to the central metro station for the whole city. The staff are friendly. The hotel is convenient to tourist and cultural sites, and is also close to downtown. It just desperately needs an update but if you're ok with tired decor, there's no reason not to stay here. And by the way the views are incredible. One downside: I did have a lot of problems with the wifi ... although it was free! It dropped a lot."
15,1506,"Mar 19 2009 	Aging Doubletree But Not Too Bad	Spent 3 nights at this property (then a Doubletree). Good location, large rooms, excellent views of Montreal. Rooms could use a makeover--not awful, but not up to today's standards. Parking garage was something of a pain and a bit pricey. Had breakfast buffet one morning in hotel--expensive but pretty good. At the right price, I would recommend this hotel."
16,1506,"Jan 13 2009 	Great Hotel and Location	One of my favorite hotels-- I have stayed there three times to catch the Just For Laughs comedy festival or just to experience Montreal's cafes. The rooms are roomy, clean and have excellent views of the downtown skyline. The service is very English friendly if you need it. It can sometimes take a while to check in if you come during the rush, but they give you a free cookie, nice touch. The location is very close to the center of the comedy festival and if you like walking you can get to several of the areas hotspots on St. Laurent and St. Denis. It's also just a few blocks to a Metro station. I try not to stay anywhere else now."
17,1506,"Dec 16 2008 	Be aware of billing practices in this hotel	Recently stayed 1 night with the kids. The purpose of stay - my husband's 50th anniversary which has been spoiled later by the fact that we found $250 additional charges on Visa made by the hotel. After multiple attempts to contact the hotel billing department for an explanation, we've been told that we smoked in the room and have been charged for that!WE ARE A FAMILY OF NON-SMOKERS AND DO NOT SMOKE AT ALL! As of today (four weeks after our stay), the management of the hotel is still inaccessible for answers. WILL DEFINITELY AVOID STAYING IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT IN FUTURE."
18,1506,"Nov 3 2008 	Definately past its prime but nowhere as bad as some reviews make it to be!	I'll try to keep this review pretty short as I agree with many points that have been made by previous reviewers on this site. Stayed for one night on Halloween this week-end and it was, as the rating suggest, an average hotel and stay. I would definately not pay much more than I did but around the CAN $100 a night mark, the hotel is terrific value! You won't find much better accomodation around that price range in Montreal. I also don't understand those who said it is not downtown Montreal, the Doubletree definately IS downtown, in the Latin district. The business district is a little further away but you are 10 minutes or less by foot from St-Denis and St-Laurent where you'll find many restaurants/bars and Montreal architecture. The village is also 10 minutes away walking, tops. There is a pharmacy right in front of the hotel and a grocery store about 5 minutes away (again, all by foot). Here are some points however on which I agree with previous reviews:-We also brought a labtop to take advantage of their free Wifi and it did keep cutting off or we had trouble connecting to the network. If you're just checking attractions/restaurants it ain't that bad for for a business traveler, that would definately get annoying. At least they don't charge like most fully branded Hiltons. -Rooms are definately a bit worn, but only for some things. It's funny how they seemed to have put some effort in renovating some things and others items were left untouched. For instance, our carpet looked if not brand new, very recently changed. The wallpaper had no trace of use/peeling either and the beds are the standard Doubletree fare with jumbo pillows and a very comfy mattress. Now, there are a few things I did notice as I stayed numerous times here (last time before this one in 2001 with my parents, back when I was still a teen) in the late 90s when the hotel was still a Crowne Plaza. The furniture is still the same as what they had around 1996-97 when I first stayed there as a kid. To give them credit though, our furniture was in perfect condition, if not a bit classic in style, with no scratch marks or anything. I've seen recently renovated hotels with much more worn furniture. Their's is hardwood though which is probably why it stays in such a great shape. The bathrooms were also left mostly in their original state, with some minor improvements such as new lighting fixtures and a curved shower rod. Just don't expect a nice granite countertop and floors here. Again, at around 100$ downtown Montreal, can't complain since it was clean. Be aware howerver that not all rooms are equal, since I asked to see a new one after the one I was assigned was right next to the elevator landing, even though my HHonors profile states I want to be away from elevators and it had certainly not had as much care as the first room they gave me. -The pool area is grotty and was empty both times we checked it out. This area was what seemed like it needed the most attention here. A good scrub in the change rooms and around the floor's edges definately required. -Views from the rooms are absolutely beautiful no matter where your room is, as the hotel is on top of a hill with few tall towers around.-The hotel was busy on this Halloween night and so was their Valet. I don't like using Valet Parking so I decided to stick to self-parking and not only do you have no in-out privileges, there is a 12.75 cash deposit required on arrival. They don't take credit cards. And they won't let you park within their view so you can go grab cash. Awful service from the parking's management and the hotel on that part who was of no help, unless you used their valet.Other observations:-Staff was not as cold as some made them to be but I've definately had better service in Hilton family properties before. Female staff certainly more cheerful and willing to help I found than their male counterparts that were there on the night of arrival. -Service calls were not promptly responded to. We had no wash clothes the first night and called the next morning to get some. It took two calls to housekeeping and nearly half an hour to get some.-Went down to check out the restaurant to see If they had any food left just before lunch time and the employee there was too busy chatting on the phone to even acknowledge me, even though I was literally standing in front of her. I left. -Lobby is still the same as it was in the 90s minus a new floor but well-preserved, if you like traditional flair. Elevators are quick.My conclusion? Stay here, especially in the low season when they have awesome rates and you'll get a decent, clean room, a stunning, safe location, HHonors points if you're a member, great views from the rooms and free Internet. My advice would be to just keep your expectations low and you'll be more than happy with this Doubletree."
19,1506,"Nov 3 2008	Comfortable stay	Comfortable stay at this well located high-rise on Sherbrooke. Had a great view of downtown from the 12th floor. However, rooms, and in particular bathrooms, are in need of a makeover."
20,1506,"Nov 2 2008 	Faded beauty- Honest yet shows its age	Booked this through Priceline for 82$ all inclusive. As one of the previous reviewer mentioned, as the Canadian dollar is going down, it may be worthwhile to check the Hilton website directly, which is in CA$. We arrived late. When I called in the morning, they told me only rooms with doubles where available, however, I was given a King upon request. Service was friendly. The hotel was very busy on this Halloween evening. The room itself was clean, spacious, with a very comfortable king bed and pillows which were not overtly soft. The bathroom is diminutive and the shower is anaemic at best, and rather dirty, due to the anti-slip covering on the floor of the bath. Toiletries are adequate. The view from the room on the 18th was quite nice, overseeing the Champlain bridge and the river. The exercise room is equipped with TV mounted aerobic machines. The pool is of decent size, however, the walls were peeling and moulding. The sauna is in each of the men and ladies room, and barely worked in both, I understand. Parking is expensive, but you can park on St-Hubert, and streets further east, or its 7 to 10$ for 24h at the Bibliothque Nationale. Metro is very close (Sherbrooke Station). Restaurant is expensive for breakfast, so I recommend L'vidence on St-Denis and Cherrier (4.99$ for 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, potatoes, fruits, and toasts, with maple syrup!).Overall, a decent hotel showing some signs of wear and in need of a good refurbishing."
21,1506,"Oct 27 2008	Strongly Recommend	Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for our two-year anniversary for the weekend and booked a basic room through their website. It was $160.00 per night, which wasn't to bad. Check in time is 15:00 but we arrived at 10:00 that morning. Upon our arrival (5 hours before check-in time), the receptionist told us that there was something wrong with our room that we reserved, so they bumped us up to the &quot;La Presidente Suite&quot; on the sixth floor ($300.00 / night value!) for NO extra charge. They were very welcoming and polite and I would STRONGLY RECCOMEND this hotel to anyone going to Montreal. Our Suite had a kitchen, ceramic tile floors, living room, couch, lay z boy, tv, and our rooms had a queen bed with a tv as well. The bathroom was geourgeous and had Neutrogena products; which was also good. Overall, the location was great and the friendly staff were amazing. The Metro station is not far at all (once you walk out the main lobby, turn left). It was a great anniversary and an excellent hotel to stay at."
22,1506,"Oct 22 2008 	Heart of Veggie Heaven	We got a good deal on this hotel through Priceline, BUT I would recommend checking the exchange rate and the rate the hotel itself is offering.This is a solid three-star hotel, as advertised. It's nice and clean, somewhat upscale and perfectly located for leisure travel. There are two Metro stops within easy walking distance, and from there, all the city's attractions are easily accessible.For vegetarians, the location of this place at the edge of the Latin Quarter is fantastic. The lower part of rue St. Denis is a very short walk from the hotel, and it offers a variety of veg and veg-friendly restaurants, including the unbelievable Le Comensal.The reception desk people were not friendly or helpful at all. Parking is $15.75 a day with NO in-out privileges at a private garage behind the hotel. BUT the hotel people will dispense no information except that the garage exists.I hasten to add that we were treated with the utmost courtesy everywhere else in Montreal."
23,1506,"Oct 19 2008 	Just okay.	There is nothing spectacular for this hotel, so the price is reasonable. Valet parking is expensive (and if you park it yourself, you are charged each time you take the car out), and when we got our car out on the second there, there was a non-stop rattling-scraping sound! The receptionist who checked us in is possibly the gravest-looking woman. Not a single smile passed her face, and she was supposed to be welcoming us! The maid, on the other hand, was very nice and efficient, cleaning the bathroom without waking me up (on my boyfriend's request) and stocking us up on chocolates! The room is dilapidated, with holes on the sheets and blanket and signs of breakage on the wall. Brown stuff (either from the pool walls or from the sauna) stuck on my boyfriend's trunks. He also got a rash around his neck after that night of swimming there. I like the fact that there is a coffee-maker, but the coffee that they have is pretty disgusting. Lavazza should not taste like that. The internet connection is just awful. We have two laptops, and on both, we kept getting disconnected. The view is great, but I'm not sure if that makes up for everything else."
24,1506,"Oct 14 2008 	Very Good Stay	Given all the bad reviews, I was very apprehensive about staying here. But overall, I definitely can recommend the hotel. There's no doubt the hotel has seen better days. But if you can get beyond that, it has several big advantages: --Location: The hotel is at the beginning of the Plateau area. What I liked about the location was that you were in much more of a neigborhood than downtown. Within a five minute walk, you probably had two dozen restaurants, nice apartment buildings, shops, convenient stores, etc. You were right near the Metro. You are also a 5-10 minute walk from where the Aerobus airport shuttle departs from, and probably about a 20 minute walk from the old city. --Price: When I booked, the Doubletree was at least $60 or $70 a night cheaper than comparable hotels. --Rooms: Again, the rooms are definitely a bit worn. But you had terrific beds, free internet , free coffee and cookies, and my room had an incredible view."
25,1506,"Oct 13 2008 	Don't judge a book by its cover...	Admittedly, the Doubletree Montreal is an aging hotel (it used to be part of the Holiday Inn family), but I think you will find this a most enjoyable and convenient place to stay.First off it has a great location on Rue Sherbrooke Est just outside the hustle and bustle of the city center. Secondly, it has a Metro stop right next to the hotel. Thirdly, it has a parking garage connected to the hotel where I parked my car for the weekend at a very reasonable rate. Best of all there is a passageway right off the lobby that leads right into the garage. Best bet is to avoid the valet service and take your car directly to the garage. Just tell the garage staff you are staying at the hotel and they will advise you of the rate and where to park your car..As for the room, it was very nice with a beautiful view of the city. Admittedly the room's decor and amenities were dated, but the beds were new and most comfortable.The breakfast buffet was excellent and the oversized towels guests find in the health club/pool were a nice touch.Yes, as I stated above the hotel is showing its age a bit, but the &quot;little touches&quot; they have added make this a place to which I will gladly return!"
26,1506,"Oct 6 2008	Do NOT Stay Here	Do yourself a favor and stay clear of this place. Other than the comfortable beds, there are few nice things about this place. The check in was horrible. Our rooms weren't ready on time. I have young kids and requested adjoining rooms when I made the reservations. When they gave us our rooms, they said the hotel was full and there were no adjoining rooms available. They said maybe the next day when it wasn't as busy, adjoining rooms would become available. The next day (different staff), we were told there ADJOINING ROOM don't exist in this hotel!!! I then asked him why, when I made my reservation, they didn't tell me that? He sent for the manager. The manager did some major double talking that to this day, I still don't know whether that hotel has adjoining rooms. Just left a sour taste in my mouth. The rooms themselves were small. The decor was dated. The bathroom was atrocious for a &quot;higher&quot; end hotel. It was small and old...in major need of a face lift. The parking was terrible. The Valet parking was SOOO slow. The hotel has only a very small driveway and cars are squeezed into it. Every time you were in the lobby, you would consistently overhear people complaining about the valet parking. The self-parking was no better. It doesn't allow you in/out access. Overall, bad service and bad accomodations. Again, do yourselves a favor and stay elsewhere."
27,1506,"Oct 1 2008 	OK stay at the Doubletree	My partner and I stayed at the Doubletree this past weekend for a extended weekend getaway in Montreal. We booked the room through Orbitz and got a good deal for the quality of the room and hotel. Pros: Ask for a room on an upper level floor. We had a fantastic view of Downtown, the St. Lawrence River, and Mont Royal. We spent a tad bit more for the King bed room which was very spacious. The pool, steam room, and fitness area were well maintained. We loved the location, unlike other reviews. We were actually glad we were not directly in downtown, but in the charming Plateau neighborhood with plenty of great restaurants and boutiques a block away. The hotel is connected directly to a passage way to the Sherbrooke metro stop for easy transportation to Montreal's tourist sites...And for those interested in checking out the Village, its within an easy walking distance to Rue Ste. Catherine (10 min.) along the very safe Rue Berri.Cons: The hi-speed wi-fi did not work during our entire stay despite many tries and calls to the front desk for help. Our bathroom was perhaps renovated but was small and not well-designed at all (esp. the shower). The front desk staff ranged from friendly and helpful to apathetic. And despite the convenience, don't order the room service breakfast - the eggs were powdered and runny (awful!) and the espresso cold and weak. Much better breakfast can be found nearby."
28,1506,"Sep 17 2008 	Needs Updating	Good location although recommend having a car for this area. Staff was polite and helpful, valet was good little expensive .The rooms were dated and not as clean as other hotels but acceptable the washrooms were very tiny and need of a upgrading badly. Internet wi-fi service was troublesome at times and not reliable. Received a deal on Priceline and would pay that price again but would not pay rack rate for this hotel."
29,1506,Sep 15 2008 	Good hotel a bit out od downtown	The Double tree has its plus and minus points. The plus points:1. Rooms are large and the property is pretty well maintained.2. The coffee maker in the room has Lavazza coffee and the amenities in the bathroom are Neutrogena. Both pretty nice and aplenty!3. The internet is free and printing available at the lobby is free too!The minus points:1. The internet works extremely slow and is erratic and you wish you could pay for a faster connection.2. The Hotel is 2 stops from downtown Montreal (McGill and Peel) so you are a bit far away fromn the action.3. There is no fridge in the room (or atleats was not in mine!)Overall a fair enough hotel that you can trade for one which is more centrally located.
30,1506,"Sep 8 2008 	Good value good hotel	I stayed here for one night. We arrived at about 1, and they were unable to give us early check-in, but they were swamped (due to the Honduran soccer team staying thereand hundreds of Honduran fans).The room was clean, view fantastic, beds comfortable (with duvets instead of awful bed spreads). Everything was as good as can be expected, particularly for $100. Good location at the top of St. Denis, easy walk to St. Laurent, right above a Metro station.There isquite a bit of street parking on the side streets - just avoid the areas reserved for local residents. This saved us $20 in parking."
31,1506,"Sep 2 2008 	Excellent	This is a wonderful place. I got a king size room, on a high floor with a spectacular view of the city for just $100 on a Saturday and couldn't be happier. Everything in the room was spotless, looked and smelled new and fresh, very similat to a Marriot. Bed was comfortable, didn't see any stains anywhere, carpet included. The room was behind the elevator and still couldn't hear ANY noise. The only thing that could be a setback was, eventhough we put the heat to 75, it was kinda cold in the room, but didn't have time to deal with it, the soft and warm quilt took care of it :). There was plenty of towels and soap in the bathroom and the coffe maker came with premium Lavazza cofee!Location is also great, on the major Sheerbroke ave, just 5 min drive from Crescent street and Old Montreal, $10 by taxi, plus only one block from Saint Denis street with tens of bars and restaurants. Also, plenty of free overnight parking around the hotel.I realy can't imagine a better deal than this Dobletree in all of montreal, where even the nastiest room in a shady area will cost you at least 70 bucks. This hotel will be my only choice if I want to visit Montreal again."
32,1506,"Aug 30 2008 	expecting more	Hotel was ok. I was expecting so much more. I booked an Executive room and was expecting what the Double tree hotels usually give to Executive rooms. But it seems that this hotel doesn't give those &quot;special services&quot; . Our hotel book said that our room was suppose to have robes, it did. It was suppose to have a wet bar, it didn't. It was suppose to have an in room safe, it didn't. it was suppose to have a private lounge for executive level floors, it didn't. Evening reception, no. The morning breakfast we had to call down to the front desk and ask was that included like it had said. It was, but only for the 2 adults, children would be extra. The room was large. The beds comfortable. The house keeping staff was wonderful. Room service was prompt and good. Pool was older, but kids liked it. Parking was a bit of a mess, but thanks to the excellent valets they took care of any problems. Front desk staff were helpful and pleasant."
33,1506,"Aug 29 2008 	Interesting stay	I stayed at the Doubletree for two nights. The location was much better and more convienent than I had thought it would be when I booked it. It was just around the corner from the Metro stop that can take you to the eating and shopping areas in Montreal.The bathroom needed updating, but was adequate for our needs. We had a north facing room and we didn't hear a single other guest while we were in the rooms. We had two confusing occurences happen to us. The first was when our keycards became demagnetized after being in a pocket of my purse all day. According to the girl at the desk this happens when the cards come into close proximity to credit cards or a magnet. She quickly reactivated them and we were able to enter our room. The second came when our bill reflected a charge for phone calls that were made before we had checked into our room. This was also corrected quickly at check-out. Overall, a nice stay and I would stay there again if only for the close proximity to public transportation and the view."
34,1506,"Aug 27 2008 	Great location 	This hotel is in a great location, directly above the metro station (this helped when it was pouring rain!). It is a few blocks from a street with many restaurants, also convenient. It is a few blocks from downton and all the sites. The location itself is on the intersection of two busy streets, so nothing romantic about that.The room was perfeclty fine, clean but again nothing so fantastic.On a night of pouring rain we ate dinner at this hotel's restaurant - I recommend you NOT do this (unless it is pouring rain!) There are not many choices and what there is is not so delicious.Now for the glitches... every night we stayed (3 nights) our room key did not work. We had to go downstairs to the lobby to get it re-activated every single day. Staff acted like this is a very common problem. Also, it was valet-only parking, and on the last day valet took 50 minutes to get our car out of the garage - and there were not many people waiting, either! Finally, they didn't give us a cookie (like most doubletrees) although later we saw others getting cookies. The latter is not really a gripe, just an observation. Key thing was quite annoying though."
35,1506,"Aug 22 2008 	Excellent Stay	We stayed at this hotel for literally 12 hours as we were passing through Montreal. My fiance and I lived in Montreal for about 7 years, so we knew the location was great, and considering the good price it just couldn't be beat. We arrived late after driving, and were greeted with great and fast service. The valet parking was full, but they offered a great alternative.The room was HUGE, and we had a view of downtown/old port. It was very comfortable, and the to-go coffee cups that you could brew yourself in the morning were a nice touch. The bathroom was just so-so. In that regard, you are definitely not staying in luxury accommodations. We didn't order room service, but the menu actually looked really good and varied, so I wish we had tried it.All in all, a great hotel given the location and price. I'm not sure the value can be beat in that area."
36,1506,"Aug 17 2008 	Great rooms great location great vacation!	This hotel should be rated much higher on tripadvisor. This hotel was very comfortable. Beautiful lobby, nice hallways, large guest-rooms with amazing bedding and sheets. The bathroom was just average as were the elevators and the elevator banks. The front dest staff were both friendly and helpful and had a pleasant demeanor. The location of this hotel was key! Centrally located, right across the street from the subway/metro stop, and easy as pie to find your way around the city. We walked almost everywhere from the hotel. Near great restaurants and clubs, as well as tourist sights too. Would definitely come back to this hotel. Great value, overall great stay. Recommended by me!"
37,1506,"Jul 29 2008	Excellent location	We had to be as close as possible to the Cegep du Vieux Montreal venue so we chose the Doubletree Plaza Hotel. We were not sure we chose a good location nor good hotel after reading the various mixed reviews here, but at least for us in the end this hotel was outstanding for both location and comfort. And since we had to be here for ten nights we had to find something reasonably priced. Staying in Vieux Montreal would cost a fortune and frankly it was too far to walk to and from the Cegep as we had time constraints. And we did not want to rely on public transportation constantly. I suppose it depends on one's personal feelings, but the Chateau L' Argoat hotel is directly across the street from the Doubletree. It's true the Chateau L' Argoat is something like what one would find in Paris, for example, as it's a converted home that's now a sort of B &amp; B. Our rate at the Doubletree actually was a bit less than the Chateau's and we got more amenities at the Doubletree.As to the hotel iself the hotel room had a bland, basic chain hotel look, the bathroom needs to be remodeled. The front desk staff ran from cold and unhelpful (some day staff) to very friendly and accomodating (evening staff). The concierge staff were all helpful however. The restaurant staff are not so good. One morning you'd get muffin with jam and butter served on the side, French toast served with maple syrup on the side, and other mornings you had to ask for them. Location-wise we were very happy with the hotel. It is located on the border of the Plateau Mont Royal and Quartier Latin districts. That means you have a ton of choices for restaurants, cafes, and bars. We loved that we could walk a few minutes and cross the Square St. Louis and onto rue Prince Arthur with its myriad of restaurants offering outdoor seating since it's summertime. Nighttime is the best with the locals and tourists out late at night eating and drinking at the outdoor tables just like they do in France. If you want to walk to Vieux Montreal it is very possible. We took about half an hour in the rain and all. And if you want to do shopping on the rue Ste. Catherine that is very possible to walk to as well. So in addition to the nice location the atmosphere couldn't have been any better.In the end, I really do not agree that the Doubletree is in a bad area at all as some reviews have said."
38,1506,"Jul 6 2008 	Comfortable room great location.	I liked staying at this hotel. Of course, I have to admit, I booked it through priceline without knowing what I was getting and got a really good deal.It is a typical high-rise chain hotel. It is located at the edge of Plateau and Quartier Latin neighborhoods, right next to a subway station. Since it's in a nice residential neighborhood, there are many good restaurants and stores around. It looked like the hotel catered largely to airline crews and people coming to conferences/exhibitions. I haven't tried the ovepriced restaurant. There is a gym and a small indoor pool.My room was very spacious and had a nice view. There was a large desk and there was free Wi-Fi in the room. The only major annoyance - it was impossible to turn off the A/C. It kept blowing cold air with a loud hissing noise. The thermostat controlled only a heater by the window. I had to stick a towel in the A/C vent to be able to sleep. Also, even though the bathroom looked recently remodeled, it was done without much care for quality.But overall it was the most comfortable stay I had in a long time."
39,1506,"May 27 2008 	Very accommodating	We booked 3 rooms for 2 nights this past weekend for a stay at the Doubletree Montreal. We were not disappointed. I picked this hotel mostly because of the price, I found a good deal online for the holiday weekend. The rate was comparable to many lesser rated hotels on this site. I was slightly apprehensive because of some of the other reviews, but all 5 of us enjoyed our stay. We found the staff to be very accommodating to our needs. We all enjoyed the warm chocolate chip cookies at check in. We switched 2 of the rooms after the first night, one because we decided we wanted a better view, another because we wanted 2 separate beds. The rooms that were alleged to have a single queen bed appeared to actually have a double (if you want a larger bed I would request a room with a king size). The front desk was helpful with changing the rooms and we found the second set of rooms to our satisfaction. Overall, all the rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable, bathrooms were free of mold, views of the city were nice. As noted in other reviews, the bathrooms are small (towel rack is in the shower itself). The first night I found the neighboring room was noisy (TV was very loud, people yelling), second night was very quiet. We found the location was good, 1 block to Saint Denis (latin quarter area) about 3 blocks to Prince Arthur Street area, metro stop is right next door if you don't feel like walking back after further jaunts to Vieux Montreal, etc. Our reservation did not include breakfast, although the first morning we did eat at the hotel for the buffet. We found the food was good although for about $18/person we certainly could have found food elsewhere for less money and comparable quality. Next time I would try to arrange breakfast to be included in the reservation. The parking was convenient (attached to the hotel) but also was a bit steep at $17/day. But it is nice to know your car is indoors. Also note if you decide not to use the valet service you will need cash ($12 deposit initially) for parking. Overall, I would say this is a good quality 3 star hotel (anyone looking for luxury accommodations should look elsewhere). It covers the basics and a little more very well and I would certainly consider it during my next visit to Montreal."
40,1506,"May 18 2008	Not so bad......Not so great.....	This hotel is located in the Latin Quarter of Montreal. Not quite downtown in the business district, but definitely close to the great pubs and restaurants of Rue St. Denis, and right next door to the Sherbrooke Metro station which provides quick access to most places you want to be at in downtown Montreal. Got this hotel at an excellent price on Priceline (3 Star Category). Check-In was pleasant and efficient. Front desk staff were always willing to help and provide directions. No problems at all. Parking is a bit of a rip off at $16.00 a day with in and out privileges. I parked for free on the street at night although you have to be careful where to park - its tricky! Tip - For free parking at night, go 50 yards east to St. Hubert. On the west side of St. Hubert close to Sherbrooke, there is space for about 3 cars between the last driveway on St. Hubert, and Sherbrooke Street. There are other places too, however those spots were closest to the hotel and always available at night. The lobby is newly renovated and looks good, although many other areas of the hotel are still tired and worn. The elevators are dreary looking and sounding. Only the very top floors have renovated rooms. Do all you can to get one, however, unless you're paying full rate, you'll most likely get an unrenovated room. The carpet is very dull looking and the room although comfortable and very clean, has seen better days. The bathroom is horrible. Very very small, and no towel rack which I found bizarre. All towels are placed in a rack inside the bathtub. There is no counter space at all, so if you're more than one person it will be very cramped in the bathroom. There is free wireless interent, however, I noticed that availability was only intermittent and not reliable. This hotel will improve once the rooms are renovated, but for now, this is a budget hotel that should only be considered at a very deep, discounted price."
41,1506,"Apr 21 2008	Average stay	I stayed at this hotel a couple of nights ago. I got it for $65 plus taxes on Priceline(3 star category). First of all, not many locals know about this hotel. It is also a bit out of the way from the financial district &amp; university area where high end hotels are located. Having said that I walked very slowly to Old Montreal in 30 minutes. It also took me 30 minutes to Holt Renfrew in high heels. Montreal is pedestrian friendly so if you like to walk then the location is not bad. Metro station is also 2 minutes away. I was able to check in at 2:30 pm. I had called the night before to confirm a non-smoking room but forgot to ask for a queen bed. I got a double bed room 1406. It had wall to wall large window facing west. The room was huge and nicely furnished. White crisp linens, lots of pillows, comfortable bed. The bathroom was a disappointment. It looked outdated, and tacky shower curtains didn't help. Still the bathroom was large(larger than Fairmont Queen Elizabeth bathrooms) and there were thick, fluffy white towels and Neutrogena toilettries. I however didn't have a good night's rest. First of all, I was having a mild skin irritation when I got in the bed. The hotel allows pets and I thought maybe that or smoke residue had something to do with my reaction. Secondly, there were large number of young people staying at the hotel. They were noisy well into 2 am. I couldn't sleep in late the next morning as there was construction going on outside. Front desk service was very efficient but they never asked how my stay was. Maybe they heard complaints about the noise the night before? The hotel is what I had paid for. I probably would not seek out this hotel the next time, but if you don't mind pet hairs and some noise, the hotel is solid."
42,1506,Apr 19 2008 	Definitely Not a 4-star	I didn't notice the hotel was under renovation. The spacious room I got was quite old and bathroom is not that clean.Beds are very comfortable.Metro sherbrooke is 2min away by walk and you can reach downtown in less than 10 min.Average price paid was 62 $ for one night.
43,1506,"Apr 13 2008 	Nice stay	Similar to many other reviewers, I got a good deal on Priceline for this hotel. A last minute trip, I was quite pleased with the hotel. In regards to some of the other reviews, the hotel is now under renovation. The lobby was being renovated when I was at the hotel and some of the guest rooms had been partially updated (some new furniture, some old tvs, etc). Ordered room service my first night there-it was decent and not too terribly over-priced. Front desk was helpful with directions and the hotel in general was pretty convenient. I didn't really explore around the hotel very much, because I was busy all day, but it looked like a quieter area. It is the hotel where many of the Air Canada flight attendants and pilots were staying."
44,1506,"Mar 3 2008 	Nice Location	My wife and I had a great experience at this hotel. I was a little worried after it popped up on Priceline after reading some of the reviews. I got it for $65.Located next to the Sherbrooke Metro station, and close to Rue St. Denis and Rue St. Laurent.Friendly, efficient valet. Excellent front desk staff. Fresh chocolate chip cookies upon check in.$18CA valet parking in heated garage. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
45,1506,Feb 23 2008 	Acceptable....	I got this hotel for $53 on Priceline. It is not a flawless Hilton property. It is an older hotel with many signs of its former Holiday Inn days. The location is OK right next to the Sherbrooke Metro station.
46,1506,"Dec 30 2007	Will stay here again.	We just got back from a trip where we stayed at this hotel for one night. We found the hotel to nice and clean. The only complaint I would have with room is some drywall above the texture wallpaper was not finished nicely. Otherwise the room was a good size and nicely furnished. My wife was bothered by people partying in the hallway and adjacent rooms during the night.For the price we paid, we found this to be a very good deal. They gave us cookies when we checked in.After I booked this on Hotwire and read some of the previous reviews of this hotel, I was worried. When we enter the room, I was pleasantly suprised.I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and we would stay at the hotel again."
47,1506,"Oct 21 2007 	Beautiful hotel.. a bit of a walk to everything	Beautiful hotel, the gym was above average, but all the clubs and bars are about 5 blocks away. Which is not as fun duriing the wintercold. The key to finding all the spots is once you step out of the place, make a right, and keep walking until you see signs of life."
48,1506,"Oct 17 2007 	Avoid this hotel!	This hotel was rated a 3 star on hotwire...way too many stars. Rude front desk staff, vomit on the bedskirt, old nylons under the bed, a bathroom that I can't even describe....I am not a diva, and I do not write this review lightly. The location is okay, the room size is all right, and giving credit where it is due, the beds are quite comfy(I checked nightly to make sure they were clean). Our sheets never got changed over 4 nights. One day, we didn't get any facecloths or towels. Our glasses were rinsed under the bathroom tap and replaced. 3 of us in the room, and they would not leave us three coffee cups, only two. Room service was unbelievably horrid....ever had a daquiri rimmed with salt? Or a cosmo served in a cocktail class with a plastic spider in it(I'm assuming for halloween, but by that point, let me say I certainly didn't see the humor). I have stayed in a lot of places....this is the ugly stepsister of hilton...please find somewhere else to stay to avoid disappointment."
49,1506,"Oct 9 2007 	Bad Vibes So So Location Good Size Room	I spent one night at the Doubletree Plaza (formerly Intercontinental property known as the Crowne Plaza) because I needed to be near the Latin Quarter. I also stayed at the Sheraton Le Centre (close to McGill University) and I stayed at the Hotel Gault in old Montreal.The hotel is located near the Latin Quarter and is across the street of a Metro station. Some guests told me they choose this property because of proxmity to Metro station and they prefer to stay at Hilton properties.During my stay in Montreal the weather was exceptional warm and dry. McGill is very attractive university on a small mountain.Check was okay but felt odd vibe from the check in staff. Rest of staff appeared to be efficient. My room was good size room, clean but recently was painted. The bed was comfortable and their was good size desk and television offered plenty of local and cable stations. The bathroom was a bit old looking but it was clean. The weather was moderate during my stay but I could see that the properties Heating &amp; A.C. system could be an issue (no variable controls in the room).I ate at terrible restaurant in the nearby Latin quarter that tried to add greater price to my bill - Napoli Pizzeria, stay away from there! The food was average.Also stay away from stores that have higher prices than the entertainment district, business district and old Montreal.I paid around $100.00 via the hotel website. I really did not like the area so I would not consider returning to this property plus I did not feel a good vibe staying here so I would not return. During my stay in Montreal I ate at the Hard Rock cafe (great service) and the Le Brassire chain which was okay. I even walked to Old Montreal which was not too long of walk. The location is probably the best thing about this property.In old Montreal I recommend Sport Du Vieux (casual dining), Restaurant Du Vieux Port (steakhouse with exceptional and friendly service), and Restaurant Des Gouverrid (Freinch cuisine).I would not return to this property because there are many better neighborhoods in Montreal to stay at."
50,1506,"Sep 7 2007 	A place to avoid	Shabby hotel that used to be the Crowne Plaza  they did the right thing in leaving. Poor reception where we were allocated a room (one bed, smoking) that clearly didnt meet our needs (two beds, non-smoking)  without being told. Revisiting reception (they dont answer when you ring) we were told a variety of excuses and creative solutions (no more rooms, twin room does not mean more than one bed, it is a very large bed) we were finally allocated a room that could accommodate a party of 3. Valet parking also a mess  you have to check in first before they park the car  needless to say its chaos outside the hotel.Location not ideal  someway from the tourist area of Old Montreal  metro close by across the road, but still two stops and a fair walk at the end.Whilst a reasonable sized room, there was a condensation problem between the panes such that what should have been a good view was almost opaque with the sunlight on it. Facilities a little lacking with no safe and mysterious room cleaning times  4pm on the first day and 8:30am on the day we were checking out. Pool was a catastrophe. No changing rooms  just a toilet and shower. Poolside towels had run out and the pool itself was very cold (17C/63F despite claiming 26C/79F). It was also under-filled so not clear whether it was filtering properly and therefore safe. No staff visible.Bar appeared closed at 10pm Sunday night. This was shame as it would have been nice to have a drink whilst waiting for the elevators to be repaired. Im sure that walking up 9 floors did us more good.Overall very disappointing and the worst hotel on our holiday."
51,1506,"Aug 29 2007 	Not thrilled	We stayed here August 10-13. Love Montreal and will definitely be back soon...but will not be staying at this hotel. The staff was friendly enough, but the entire hotel smelled like paint and the painters did not do the best job. The pool was freezing and cloudy.By far, the worst experience was with the shower. It took 10 minutes for the hot water to come out of the shower, and sometimes it didn't work at all. One morning I had to go downstairs and shower in the fitness center showers, which weren't all that clean.The hotel is in a good location and the restaurant/bar located a block away, Domini, is a great place to eat...but other than that, I was less than pleased with my stay."
52,1506,"Aug 24 2007 	It was okay.	We stayed at the Doubletree in Montreal and had called previously and booked a room for two nights. We called for directions as we were coming from the US and got terrible directions, which caused us to get lost. When we arrived, everything seemed fine. The room was lovely. However, the thermostat did not work and it was freezing in the room. We had requested a non-smoking room. We were told there were no other rooms and then they moved us to a smoking room, which if you are a non-smoker, it is not very pleasant. Our stay in Montreal, though, was wonderful and we enjoyed the city immensely and will come back again. We will, however, be staying somewhere else."
53,1506,"Aug 24 2007 	Good location good price good rooms	Contrary to several of the previous reactions, my experiences with this hotel were entirely positive. I found this hotel an excellent choice and I would most certainly stay here again when coming back to Montreal:-quiet and well-isolated room, clean and spacious with very comfortable bed-airconditining functioned very well (18 degrees all day through)-good location on Sherbrooke and Berri, next to a metro stop, close to a large selection of restaurants-very friendly and helpful service-excellent breakfast buffetI paid 129 Canadian dollars per night for a single room, booked through the hotel website."
54,1506,"Aug 20 2007 	Poor Service	Me and my wife and 7 year old boy, stayed here for 4 nights in August 2007. We were in Montreal to watch the NASCAR race.It was a really hot week 35 Celcious. The air conditioning was terrible. 30 in our room. The service in the restaurant was horrible. We sat at our table for 45 minutes before we finally retreated back to our room hungry. Ordered KFC and it arrived in 15 minutes. Next night the room service was also terrible 1hour 45 minutes for wings and nachos. Could not fit my truck in the hotel parking, it's for vehicles less than 6 feet. Had to pay $20 A day for valet parking and one night my truck literally blocked the sidewalk. With some scratches.On the morning we were leaving I had to wait 2 hours to get my truck from the &quot;valet&quot; parking. Seems someone lost the keys to the vehicle in front of me which were all parked in an alley. Will never stay there again. At $230 a night I expected much more."
55,1506,"Aug 15 2007 	Ok place to stay	Stayed here with my husband and 2 young boys. First thing to know is the parking is underground and the fee is $16 per day if you park it yourself, $19 per day if you use the valet, please note the parking is not the responsibility of the hotel but a seperate company. Also note that you cant fit a large SUV or truck down here, we have a Toyota Tacoma that barely fit. The hotel is nice and the rooms were comfortable, kind of warm in the room during the summer even with the AC turned all the way up, we had a great view of the city. They could probably use some renovations to the bathroom area, our toilet had a big crack in it and the ceiling looked like it was falling apart. Never saw anyone working at the conceriege desk. Hotel staff was friendly. Pool area is not the greatest but ok for a short swim. Very close to the Metro. All and all a good stay."
56,1506,"Aug 11 2007 	Just Horrible	Stayed at this hotel before, but I have to say this is hotel is going downhill. No air-conditioning. I complain, and the GM who I found out after was the owner, tells me this is normal it is very hot and they are working on the situation. An employee passes by and a funny smile and a discouraged face looks at me and just shock his head. Then a funny looing man comes next to the GM and says the same story how they are working on it but all hotels with central AC are going threw the same thing! Well I told them I was checking out and he rudely looked at me and said we are better off without you! As I was leaving the hotel I saw the employee that shock his head and asked him why he did that? He looked at me in a very discouraged way and said, I've worked here for 6 years and every year its the same. The owner has to put in a new system and it would cost over 100,000$ so he just patches the problem and talks story's to the brand. I have to say i was shoked but at the same time I wasn't surprised, since the owner looked like the type to do that. Just watch the God Father and you will see some major look alike and his right hand fool next to him!Never stay here trust me!!"
57,1506,"Aug 8 2007 	Not a 4 star but rather a 2 star (being generous)	The Doubletree by Hilton is by far the worse star hotel Ive ever stayed in, from the customer service to the appearance of the room. This is not a hotel the Hilton should put their signature to. We haveexperience a few incidents from this hotel and the matter should be dealt with as I am quite disturbed by the lack of professionalism from this hotel.Let me start with the Valet Parking, for a 4star hotel, there are no valet or bellboy and the door. We had to park our own vehicle and paythe valet cost, the one time we ask for Valet service, the attendant left the alley, our truck was parked in an alley where all oversized vehicle are parked, SQEALING the tires and drove rapidly onto the main busy street. He then back up into a parking sign where I repeatedly asked him to stop the truck. He did not listen and hit thesign and put a small dent in the truck. He finally stepped out of thevehicle and we pointed to him that he dented the truck; he walked away saying it happens. We were in a hurry, spoke briefly to the manager stating the incident and told him we would come by later in the evening to discuss the incident.Later that night we spoke to the Director of Operation, Mr. Mounir Greiss, and he mentioned to us this was not the first incident with this employee and that the matter will be resolved on Monday, once the employee came back to work. He then asked us if we were currentlyreceiving complementary breakfast with our room and we told him we werent. He then gave us a free breakfast and gave us an apology. Imquite astonished that we were not compensated any more for the damaged incurred to the truck as well as the Valet parking cost. We paid for a service we did not receive since we drove it in and out ourselves. On another note, the also left the truck unlocked during the night when they moved the truck, it was mentioned and showed to the valet how to arm and disarm. We have very expensive equipment in the truck and relieved none were stolen.Now for the customer service, the biggest issue was ordering room service. When the room attendant came up and Bill opened the door he pushed the door open and walked passed Bill and asked where he would like the tray put down. It was quite embarrassing since I was in the room and lacked in the clothing area, actually, I had no clothes on and hid under the covers. Does the hotel have a policy for the attendant to ask the client to enter the room?Now other issues or concerns I would like to point out: Maid cleaned the room but did not replenish items such as towels. We had nothing left by our last morning and had to scramble to find a main on our floor and get towels. Called 3 times to get room service and no one answered. Even the Careline had to response. We were in a non smoking room and floor and the room smelled like smoke and a wet dog.  The sheer curtains were brown of cigarette smoke and had cigarette burns. I understand that the hotel wants to be pet friendly however the hotel should have a floor designated for pets only. This is concern for people who have severe allergies and asthma. For hygiene purposes, some pets have fleas and if you allow the dogs to sleep in every room, it will be harder to maintain and actually Im quite grossed out at the thought of sleeping in a bed or walking on the floor thinking a dog may have done his business there."
58,1506,"Aug 6 2007 	Quiet room comfortable bed	I had booked a room for 7 nights. Upon arrival, I was given a room on the 19th floor. Once I got there, I found that no matter what I tried to adjust the air conditioning thermostat, it wouldn't work. The room was stuffy and very warm. Obviously, the air conditioning wasn't working. I immediately called front desk and they sent a repairman to fix the problem, but unfortunately, it couldn't be fixed, so they offered to give me a different room. The staff was very helpful in changing me to another room. I was then given a corner room with two windows on the 11th floor with better air conditioning and a beautiful view. The room had two regular size beds which were very comfortable, lots of fluffly pillows, the shower worked great, although the counter space is very limited. I had a nice desk with a CD player, a good sized TV to the right of both beds. The maids came in daily to clean the room, the bathroom and replace toiletries, although they didn't replace the toilet paper much. However, on my way out in the mornings, I usually saw a maid working and asked her for the toilet paper and she was very friendly and helpful with whatever I needed in the room.I found the restaurant a bit pricy but that is the norm for hotels restaurants, which didn't surprise me, so I usually ate on one of the many inexpensive places on Rue St. Dennis, or had breakfast on a little pastry shop around the corner from the hotel inside the metro station.The hotel is located on a hill, so if you walk to the restaurants on Rue St. Dennis, it can get tiring if you're not used to walking much. The metro station is right next to the hotel, and there is also a bus stop right around the corner.Overall, the staff was always very helpful, and they spoke both english and french. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that the air conditioning didn't work very well. The lobby and the restaurant were always warm and although I got a cooler room than I originally had, the air conditioning was on the warm side and some nights I woke up sweating during the night."
59,1506,"Jul 30 2007 	Filthy room - packing up 4 days early!	So I arrive at ten at night with two small children. Tired, stressed, wanting somewhere nice to lay my head. I had booked this hotel for five days. Imagine my disgust at the hairs in the bathroom sink, floor, tub and the used cotton bud in the middle of the floor in our room. I believe you get what you pay for - and I would have expected to pay half the amount for this standard. We are on the 14 floor and can hear traffic like it's next door. Everything looks cheap too, except for the reception area. Don't stay here if your standards of hygeine are high"
60,1506,"Jul 24 2007 	Another great location in Montreal	We usually stay in the main part of downtown, so it was nice to check out a different area. We had a great time, St Denis street is a very short walk away (Just For Laughs Festival was on). 3 Amigos is a great restaurant - good food at good prices.Our room had a great view and we have no problems to report ... we would definitely stay there again!"
61,1506,"Jul 24 2007 	Executive vs Standard rooms	This is my 2nd stay in this hotel in 3 months. This time I had booked an executive room (21st floor) for an entire week and stayed with my partner.Basically, unless you need the &quot;free Internet&quot; in your room and plan on having breakfast (ideally for 2) everyday, the executive room is not worth it. Mine was actually smaller than the standard room in which I stayed the 1st time on the 16th floor. As a Hilton Honors member (Silver) I did not get a corner room (which are the ones that are bigger for the same price). That being said, that small &quot;executive room&quot; was ideal to watch the fireworks competition from the hotel and offered a view on the Olympic stadium.To put things in perspective, you get what you pay for. This hotel is little tired and has some issues with air cond., plumbing, and repairs here and there. But for the price it is an excellent value. The views are great because of its location on Sherbrooke St and the beds just fantastic!"
62,1506,"Jul 16 2007 	Mmmm Chocolate	Went to Montreal for the Just for Laughs festival, and the Doubletree had the best location (right around the corner from the festival site) and the best price I could find ($125.00 a night for a Fri-Sat stay)I saw a few megative remarks here about the hotel, but I decided to give this place a try anyway. Check in was great, we showed up early (noon) and asked if we could check in early, it wasn't a problem, the girl was very friendly and best of all gave us the famous doubletree chocolate chip cookies!!!I didn't expect much from the room, as when I had stayed at the Doubletree in New Orleans, the room had been very standard, so I was very pleasantly surprised at the size of the room, and the great view (we were on the 17th floor).The beds were incredible, and reminded me of the perfect sleeper beds at the Hyatt. The only problem I had during our stay was that the air conditioning didnt seem to work (was not a problem as the window had a small opening at the bottom that opened to provide an incredible breeze) as well once we notified the front desk they offered to move us or send up a fan, we chose the fan and it was perfect."
63,1506,"Jul 11 2007 	Location vs Dirty carpet	This hotel was the weirdest mix of extremely positive qualities with some pretty unsavory ones, but I ultimately have to conclude that the good outweighted the bad. For some reason, we were put on the &quot;executive&quot; floor, which was amazing and unexpected (but may have had something to do with the person who booked the room being a Hilton Honors member). Shortly after arriving, a staff member knocked on our door with a plate of chocolate candies and raspberry sauce, compliments of the hotel. I had never encountered such a thing, and I'll be darned if I wasn't starting to plan my 5-star review that I'd later be writing on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately, that did not distract me from the fact that the carpet hadn't been vacuumed, and wasn't during the entire 3-day stay. To top it off, the air conditioner was defective and could not be fixed, meaning we had to open the windows for any hint of fresh air. That being said, though, the location was phenomenal and it's so close to the Metro, we didn't take the car out the entire time. I can see how my experience might have been colored by having some of the perks of the Hilton Honors program-- amazing room, free internet, unexpected chocolate-- and without these, I might not have been as satisfied. I am hesitantly recommending this hotel (I mean, the location can't be beat, and the staff is tremendous), but I would also suggest that you check all your options before seeing the &quot;Doubletree&quot; name and instantly being impressed."
64,1506,Jun 30 2007	Good solid hotel	I am a Diamond Hilton Honors Member so that may reflect the positive stay I had given so many of the negative reviews on here. I was given a great suite with a fantastic view of the city. the room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was good and the service was great. The hotel lobby and general areas seemed clean and well maintained. Overall a good experience.
65,1506,"Jun 19 2007 	Not recommended	I stayed for business 15 nights in this hotel.Except the cookies upon arrival, this hotel is not a Double Tree quality hotel.1- Parking is very small with a lot of mess inside. Please do not let the valet to park your car. Mine was scratched. I told the valet and his answer was that he did nothing. He told me that I probably scratched it....2- Restaurant: on the hotel card, it's written that the restaurant closes at 10.30 p.m. WRONG!! I arrived twice at 9.30 p.m. and the waiter told me that the kitchen closes at 10.00 p.m. After arguing that the hotel says 10.30p.m., he offered me to have a sandwich.....3- Room Service: I ordered everyday a breakfast at 7.00 a.m. from room service. Except the 3 first mornings when they served at time, the other mornings, or they arrived at 7.30 or 7.45 a.m. or never.It's the same for room service by night, many times I called them but nobody answered. I had to call reception and complaint to get something.4- Rooms are quite clean even if the bathtub ant toilets are not really clean and are old.I would not recommend this hotel. Next time I come back to Montreal, i will choose another one."
66,1506,"Jun 3 2007 	Horrible stay!	I would not recommend anyone to stay at doubletree..I read the positive comments and it was reasonable priced so I booked the hotel for a weekend getaway with my husband. When we arrived the room was not ready..and we were over an hour late to check-in and the room was still not ready. The staff were not helpful we sat at the lounge area for another hour until our was ready. The towels in the bathroom looked dirty and had hair on it, the showerhead had no pressure. The location was not great it a long walk to saint catherine and it is near the village not anywhere near the shopping district. All an all an average hotel with horribe service."
67,1506,"Jun 2 2007	Exceeds Expectations	Amazing Service! My husband and I have been the victims of rude service at several hotels in South Florida, where we live. That is why we are so appreciative of the Doubletree in Montreal. The price was very cheap (we did it through their rate called the 21 daysaver). We recieved fresh hot cookies at check-in and a hand written note in our from the lady who booked our stay. The room was fantastic with a lot of space and 2 floor to ceiling mirrors on 2 of our walls. When we had to book an additional nights stay at the last minute, they graciously gave us the same rate we got for our advance purchace. I highly recommend the doubletree to anyone staying in Montreal. Especially if you enjoy walking...it is within walking distance of everything and the subway is connected to the hotel and super convenient."
68,1506,"May 31 2007 	We loved the Doubletree	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Doubletree in Montreal from May 18-21, 2007. I read the reviews of the hotel before we booked our stayed, and noticed some of the reviews were a bit negative, but decided to try it anyway. We were glad we did. The rooms were very nice, not elegant or fancy, more on the plainly decorated side, but very comfy. The bed was terrific! Very comfortable with a down duvet. Reminded us of home. The room was quiet and had an unbelievable view of downtown Montreal and the surrounding areas. We had dinner the first night in the hotel and it was a bit pricey, but the food and the service were excellent. I noticed some of the reviews mentioned the parking lot being unsafe or dirty, etc. I must say that if you have ever parked in an underground parking garage in the city, that they are all the same. I didn't think it was bad at all, and not something I would have thought twice about, let alone write about it in a review of the hotel. You park your car, get on the elevator, which takes you directly into the lobby, and you don't see it again until you leave. Not a big deal at all and definitely not something that should be a deciding factor of whether or not you stay at this hotel. I would think all parking garages are the same. When touring the city of Montreal, don't drive, take the Metro! It was so easy to use and will get you anywhere in the city in a matter of minutes. It's clean and safe and much better than driving and parking. The metro is the way to go!"
69,1506,"May 30 2007 	Bed bugs galore...	There were a number of problems with our stay:1) at the time of reservation my credit card was charged the full and incorrect amount, although the rate required only 1 night deposit.2) I reserved a king size room and was willing to pay more for that, however, upon arrival we were given a lousy queen room with none of the services offered for the executive king rate, and we had to pay as if we stayed in the executive king room.3)The room was ok, but the bathroom was badly maintained - the fixtures looked old and worn off, there was hair in the towels and in the tub.4) There were a number of hotels in the area we could have booked, but having a 13-month old, we wanted to have an indoor pool, hence the choice went to the Doubletree hotel in Montreal. What a major disappointment that was. The pool looked nothing like the picture on the hotel's website. the lighting was dim, the ceiling had big chunks of paint peeling off and bubbling and falling into the pool. There was water everywhere. The water in the pool was extremely cold, so we couldn't even let the baby go into it. The mirrors were cracked. The towels in the pool area were too small even for a toddler, they looked like hand towels. What a horrible sight and a complete waste of money.5) and last but not least - BED BUGS. Everyone in our party: 4 adults and 1 child included (my parents booked a different room that was located 2 floors below us), got bite marks all over our bodies. We were itching and scratching our entire stay. You can expect something like that during the 18th century but in the 21st century? What a major disappointment! This is my second stay at the Doubletree hotels and trust me, I am not going back there. I usually trust the Hilton brands, but after this trip, I am seriously reconsidering ever staying at any of the Hilton properties in the future. IF it wasn't for the beautiful scenery, our trip would have been completely ruined because of the hotel conditions."
70,1506,"May 29 2007 	A big diappointment!	We just came back after staying at this hotel for 3 nights and I was so diappointed. Not only the location isn't good the service was lacking. For those who want to do a lot of the usual tourist sight seeing activities this is not a good location and a transit strike doesn't help no matter how close the station is to the hotel! The only thing that it is close to is the Latin quarter and some nice shopping and restaurants/cafes on/around St. Denis. Other 3 star hotels like Hyatt and Delta Montreal have much better location that is closer to old montreal, St. Catherine and underground shopping and also have nicer amanities in a nicer neighborhood. Three days before arrival we made request for a non-smoking corner room with a king size bed on a higher floor. When we arrived we got a room &quot;next to&quot; a corner room and two double beds on 10th floor. They only met one of our requests of non smoking room. The front desk said she would change room for us as soon as a room with a queen or king size bed became available and we heard nothing from the front desk for the entire stay and we didn't bother because we're fearing we would get a worse room.  The room looked old and if it was renovated it was done many years ago. The decor looked very early 90's. Immediately upon arrival we had a problem with the plumbing. The toilet didn't flush. We called front desk and was told they would send someone to get it fixed &quot;right away&quot; or they would switch us to another room if it can't be fixed. We waited for a good 30 minutes and no one showed up. Hubby was starving and didn't want to wait and we took off. By the time we came back it was fixed but it still looked very scary and more of the same plumbing problem occurred the next couple days. If more than 1 oz of water was dumped into the toilet it won't flush or it took 30~40 minutes to go down. It was really frustrating having to deal with this plumbing problem during our entire stay. There're times we had to go down to the mezzanine floor to use the restrooms because the maintenace personnel was taking too long to get to us (probably busy fixing plumbing problems in other rooms or delivering towels to other rooms).  The next day we came back from our outing we found our bed made up and the housekeeper left a note thanking us for the tips but when I walk into the bathroom there was not a single towel in sight. The toilet paper was untouched, no triangle or anything to indicate anything had been done and there's only 1/10 of roll left and no extra roll was left. We called housekeeping but there's no answer and eventually it was routed to front desk and the poor maintenance guy who fixed our toilet the day before showed up with towels and toilet paper. The third day we're left with no tissue paper and I just made do without it since I was so tired of calling to get problems corrected. I was thinking to myself the previous review wasn't kidding and it probably happened more frequently than it was mentioned. In all my travel I hadn't yet encountered this even in a motel. The hotel can't be rated 3 stars. Both the hardware and service is just way below standard.  After the first night there I found a faint small coffee stain on the sheet at the bottom corner so I placed the card requesting the sheet be changed. The same coffee stain was there when I returned. The same housekeeper that took our tips without leaving any towels just made up the bed and did not bother to change the sheet. The next day I placed the card right next to the coffee stain and the sheet was finally changed. If there's any stain how do I know a bed sheet was changed? Was it ever changed from the prevous stay? The thought grossed me out.  Parking is $18.80 per day after taxes and the rate is the same whether it's self parking or valet parking. They seemed to be short-staffed and always encouraged guests to get the car themselves. Each time you get your car you have to go to the front desk to get your ticket validated if you want to get your car yourself. This is not convenient since there's usually not more than 2 people at the desk and you could wait a while before getting the ticket validated. The previous review said the garage has a low ceiling and boy, it's really low. The parking spaces were a bit tight but not as bad as some of the other hotels in Montreal. We didn't find any junk on the S1/S2 levels or any dog but the garage looks like it could collapse anytime and there's no sign to indicate which way to exit. This whole parking situation is inconvenient and confusing.  Upon checking out a mysterious charge of $193 showed up on our bill and the description was in French which I had no idea what it was. BTW all the other Montreal hotels I had stayed in all took note that we're English speaking and presented everything in English or in both languages. When I inquired about this charge the front desk personnel quickly told me it was a mistake and presented me with a new bills with correct charge. As far as the front desk personnel goes I think they're efficient enough but the service suffered becuase they were short handed. Overall I would avoid this hotel at all cost. It's not cheaper than any other 3 star hotels in Montreal but you get a lot less for your money. I could understand a little plumbing problem because of the age of the building but when it's a service issue there's no excuse. There are a lot more hotels in Montreal that are in better locations and provides much nicer services for the same amount of money. No amount of warm cookies could make up for the bad services and the bad locations!"
71,1506,"May 15 2007 	Good Decent Hotel	We stayed for 4 nights in Doubletree Montreal on Rue de Sherbrooke - it was ideally placed - right next door to the Sherbrooke Metro whichwas so handy to everywhere. The hotel check (at 9pm) was seamless andstraightforward. We had booked a non smoking room and our room had the smell of stale smoke - we were offered an alternative room straight away - which when we looked at it wasnt as good as the smoky room so staff came up straight away with air freshener to sort the room out.The room was big - TV, iron &amp; board, hairdyer, neutrogena products, robes, good powerful shower, radios that could plug in an ipod and broadband if required.The bed was huge and really comfy.Great view from our 22nd floor.Breakfast was included and it was great a good hot and cold selection. Staff were ever so polite ensuring you were called by name.The best bit - the signature Doubletree cookies - when we asked we were given a second one! Worth it for the cookies alone - warm with the chocolate chips just starting to melt - mmmmmmmmm - l want one now!"
72,1506,"Apr 30 2007	WOW	Never been to Canada and came to visit schools for my son. I was so happy we stayed at this hotel. Some of my collegues mentioned this hotel was reasonable in rates compared to a lot of hotels in Montreal, and they were right. My room was awesome and the bed I could have took it home with me. The staff was really nice and the hotel was full of people, so I guess the word was getting around. When my son comes up to Montreal, I will always stay in this hotel!Very happy Alabama"
73,1506,"Apr 19 2007 	Loved the Doubletree	I stayed for a convention and was spectacle on the the quality of the hotel since we usually do meetings in 5 star properties, but was surprised in the quality of the hotel. My bedroom was magnificent and was huge. I asked other colleagues and they were also amazed to see the size of the bedrooms. Beautiful white duvet covers and full of pillows. The mattress were amazing better than the one I have at home and I paid a lot for it! The only downfall was the heat in the bedrooms it was rather warm and I just could not get the heat to go down. I called and they came to fix it but it still was rather warm. Other than that I truly enjoyed my stay and it was a great 4 nights at this hotel and I would recommend it to anyone travelling to Montreal."
74,1506,"Apr 18 2007 	Great Doubletree	Booked this hotel because it fit my perdium and I have to admit I am rather picky! There were at least 100 restaurant kitty corner to the hotel and I was so happy to eat well during my 3 days in Montreal. The rooms were great and I was really looking forward to a great night sleep. The only complaint I could say is the pool was cold when I tried on my last day, and the hotel was really packed which made it a bit long for the elevators.I would recommed this hotel to anyone who wants to do more than just staying in the hotel, even if the hotel rooms were great, there is so much to do around.James"
75,1506,"Apr 4 2007 	Loved the Doubletree	Had a great time at the hotel staff was so nice, and the hotel rooms were great. I love the bed didn't want to leave it was so confortable. THe only problem we had is we found that we always had to wait for the valet. There was only one valet and even a man from the front desk came to help but it wasn't enough. They really need to put more staff. The parking was confusing, and they made us pay again when we left because they said they had no arrangements with the hotel. So why did the hotel makes us pay? They need to get themselves organized. Please note that they have lots of crap, old chairs, carpet tables and so on in the garage S1 &amp; S2. I'm assuming they will get this garbage out ASAP because it really does not look good.Althought this inconvience I really enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again if they get more staff and the parking in order."

1,1509,Nov 25 2009 	Excellent Hotel	This hotel was very clean and beautiful as well as comfortable. The staff was very friendly. The airport shuttle was timely and the fact that I could leave my car there for a week at no extra charge was comforting. The shuttle was there again when I came back. I would definitely stay there again and have recommended it to co-workers.
2,1509,"Nov 3 2009 	Excellent hotel great service!	I stayed here overnight and was very pleased by the personal service I found. I'd 'lost' my luggage and had no extra clothes. The shuttle driver (they pick up, drop off at the airport but also will drive you within a 3 km radius) was kind enough to ask the management if he could take me to a nearby mall where I was able to buy a change of clothes and have a good dinner -- both shop and restaurant were his suggestions.The hotel was impeccably clean, large room with 2 big beds and plenty of work space, free WiFi, good breakfast, late checkout was no problem. I was most pleased!"
3,1509,"Oct 29 2009 	Desperately Seeking Definition of Customer Service!	I picked this hotel based on the rave reviews so I was shockingly disappointed upon checking in and it only got worse from there. The hotel is very difficult to get to but that is not the fault of the hotel, it is the poorly designed road system but I think folks should at least be aware. First to mention is that it is not $109 per night as even their website states. As a matter of fact, the woman who checked us in said that their rate hasn't been $109 since the hotel first opened. She had no answer when I showed her a printout of the $109 rate from their website nor would she give us that price. Fine, moving on. The hotel is nicely decorated as are the rooms. But we did not appreciate finding pubic hair on the sheets. It was obvious that the sheets had been cleaned and changed and it's one of those things that I think &quot;just happens.&quot; But when we called to have the sheets changed, the attitude was as if we were &quot;being particular&quot; or something as if we found some dust  I understand enough Spanish to have picked that much up. Ok, still not going to let it ruin the weekend. I didn't mind where the hotel was located because it is close to Dorval/Lachine where there are tons of great restaurants that line the waterfront. What I did mind is that while the front desk gave a full list of restaurant recommendations in Dorval/Lachine, they failed to tell us that they actually have free shuttle service to take you there. We found this out the next day after we battled traffic and driving around looking for parking. Also to note is that the hotel is located in an industrial area so it does smell like exhaust and fertilizer.Our first morning, we went to make coffee and noticed there was no artificial sweetener in the room. My husband is a diabetic and we called the front desk and were told by Tamara that they do not provide sugar substitute in the rooms. We asked if it would be available at the breakfast to which she replied she did not know (even though the coffee stand is 10 feet from the front desk). Apparently she not only didn't know but didn't think it was in her job description to even find out for us. When we expressed our surprise, she said &quot;I WORK AT THE FRONT DESK&quot; - CLICK! and hung up on us. Are you kidding me? Obviously, we immediately called back which is how we got her name. Oh and yes, they DO have artificial sweetener at the breakfast which we only found out after we physically went there ourselves to check it out.I travel a LOT, especially for work, so I've stayed in all kinds of hotels. I can honestly say this is the LOUDEST I've ever been in - you can't hear your neighbors above, below or next to you, but you can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the hallways. We had to complain about the noise level the entire weekend and they really do nothing about it because it's usually one person at the front desk and no manager around during &quot;quiet hours&quot; and zero security. I haven't been this disturbed at all hours of the night even at convention hotels. On the plus side, they do have a pretty good breakfast included in the room rate - both hot and cold food - which we appreciated. There is no restaurant or bar at the hotel but you can purchase snacks and beer and wine next to the front desk. I will say we lucked out with some phenomenal food in Montreal so not having a restaurant at the hotel was no big deal. We did speak to the manager before we left and voiced all of our concerns. She assured us she will speak with her boss and contact us with a response and what they will do to accommodate our issues. Upon our return, I received an e-mail that said she was sorry about our stay and the inconveniences we experienced. WOW! I was not expecting a too bad, so sad reply after the complete unprofessional attitude and behavior of her staff. In this day and age when customer service is so critical and companies compete to separate themselves from their competitors, I find this type of laziness and abundance of excuses intolerable. Everyone knows that mistakes can be made but the difference is in how you handle those issues. They say you get what you pay for and in this case, they couldn't be more right. If there was a lower rating than 1-star for service, they would be getting that from me."
4,1509,"Oct 27 2009 	Superbe airport hotel!	The usual airport hotel is old, noisy, and you would get bad service in and outdated room. Well, not at the Holliday inn express!!! We were really impressed by the desk service and the lobby in general. The rooms are very nice and carpetless! No carpet! How fantastic. The complimentary breakfast was very good, and included eggs and bacon and not only pastires and instant coffee other hotels offer you.They have 24hours shuttle and secured parking for park-and-fly. We travel throught Montreal once per season, and the Holliday inn just made it to our number one airport hotel.They will be hearing rom me again pretty soon!"
5,1509,"Oct 14 2009 	hard to find but worth it; great staff	Although it was difficult for us to find the place (the street signs are wonky), I would definitely recommend this hotel if you have your own car and want a nice place at a good price.THE GOOD: Our double queen suite was spacious and comfortable. There was a fridge, microwave, coffee-maker, and free wi-fi. The pool area is very nice, perfect for our teenager to burn off some energy. Unlike most places, they actually offered wi-fi and wired access for their free internet, and the staff let me borrow an ethernet cable so I could have a secure connection. They also sent a fax for me without charge. The best part, though, was the breakfast. They had protein! This is very important for a good start to the day, especially for diabetics, yet most hotels only serve sugar and starch. I was pleased to be offered eggs and bacon as part of the complimentary breakfast. They also had a great pool for our teenager to burn off some energy.THE BAD: Besides our initial difficulty finding the place, I have no complaints.THE UGLY: Driving in Montreal is an absolute nightmare, but that's not the hotel's fault! This was a great place to stay."
6,1509,Oct 9 2009 	Great location for airport	New hotel so everything is spick and span although the sauna was already out of order. Rooms are large and contain everything you need. Breakfast was great. There is a shuttle bus to and from the airport which is very convenient.
7,1509,"Oct 5 2009 	5 Star Hotel for the Price of 3 star Hotel !!!	Stayed there with Parents , two rooms , two couples , If you do not mind to Drive 15 minutes to Downtown Montreal, Sightseeing in Montreal all day , then drive back !!! It is well worth . Perfect New Hotel , Modern, Excelent room , Biggest room ever saw with Living room , sink and Fridge, Big Bathroom , very good Breakfast and Free Parking. All Hotels in Downtown Montreal are Double Price , plus : breakfast and Expensive Parking . Anyway , you will need a car to tour around . It is at Airport area but you do not see or listen Planes"
8,1509,"Sep 14 2009 	A Boutique Hotel hidden in an Airport Location	I have been a Priority Club Member for at least 15-20 years, so I have stayed at lots of standard Holiday Inn Express(s). This hotel is truly a different (and kinda revelatory) experience.I would up using Priority Reward Points for our 3 night stay, which would normally limit my room choice to a standard 1 or 2 bed room . But the staff at the hotel was nice enough to upgrade our room to a full 1 bedroom suite, which was absolutely perfect for our needs (travelling with our teenage son).We had recently returned from a trip to Prague and Vienna where (relying on TripAdvisor again, we stayed at 2 terrific boutique hotels) and we were more than pleasantly surprised when we entered the lobby at this hotel and it clearly gave us the impression that a lot of thought and design went into creating this new kind of Holiday Inn Express.The staff greeting upon arrival was very inviting and one got the impression that the desk staff truly cared about our experience. We were additionally impressed that though we arrived relatively late (around 11:30pm), there were still 2 people manning the check-in.The look and feel of this hotel is definitely one of far more expensive boutique hotels, and that look and feel carried over to the 1 bedroom suite that we stayed in, which was tastefully furnished, including a dining table and chairs, 2 Flat screen TVs, a large bathroom, refrigerator/wet bar and very attractive and comfortable bedding.The hotel and our room were spotlessly clean, by the way.The breakfast area is also very tastefully done with a combination of tables and counters with bar-height chairs.The breakfast choices are more typically Holiday Inn Express style, but somehow seemed to be of better quality and taste compared to many other HIE locations we've stayed in.The parking lot was huge, well lit, and had wider than normal stall markings, which helps avoid those annoying parking lot dings.Two large elevators in the main lobby meant that even though the hotel appeared sold out, there was no long wait for an elevator.I have visited Montreal dozens of times so I was not at all concerned about the airport location of this hotel because, unlike other major cities worldwide, the Montreal airport is only 8 miles from center city.The hotel was located within a 2 min drive to Rte 20 (E &amp; W) which is a major interstate type freeway which takes you directly into center city in less than 10 minutes.If this hotel represents the new direction of design and execution for future HIE projects (and also renovation), they are definitely on the right track. Boutique-style amenities at a fair price seems like a winning combination to me."
9,1509,"Sep 9 2009 	Pretty neat place	My husband and I decided to stay in something familiar before we went into Montreal's old quarter. We now wish we had continued here. Our room was modern &quot;French&quot;. The floors were of a dark wood. There was a microwave, fridge and table to eat upon. The manager sounded so American that I asked him if he was from the states. He said he had seen alot of American movies! He also let us know about the food in their freezer that let our very tired selves microwave dinner there at the hotel. The breakfast was excellent. The staff friendly and helpful. Definitely a place we can recommend!"
10,1509,"Sep 2 2009 	Great Hotel would stay here again!	My husband, baby and I just returned home from a 2 night stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Montreal. I chose this hotel because of the great reviews and it did not disappoint! Cleanliness is a must with an 11 month old crawling around, so we were extremely happy with the spotless rooms!The salt water pool area was also very clean and fully stocked with clean towels.Service throughout the hotel was great. The front desk staff, housekeeping, and the guy that continually cleaned the floors on the main floor always greeted us with a smile/hello! The only complaint I have would be with the number of staff working the morning buffet. Both mornings we had to wait while the waitress cleaned a table for us. It seemed as though this one lady was responsible for cleaning the tables, washing the dishes, setting the tables and stocking the buffet. I would recommend the manager hire one more waitress/waitor to help out during the morning buffet. All in all we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again next year."
11,1509,"Aug 31 2009 	This is great value for money new and close to airport	We stayed here one night on way back home after family vacation to the US. We had been in four other hotels in 10 days and this was our favourite. Free shuttle to and from airport. Hotel is new and very modern, rooms were very nice, the breakfast next morning was great, hot and cold, serve yourself and open at 5:30 am. Only 5 minutes from airport and new shuttle bus provided by hotel, driver was friendly and dependable.My teenagers thought it was great with the new and modern decor, the lobby is very unique and beautiful, the computers were free access with large screens. Pool is a little small but as this is airport hotel and usually only one night stay that was fine for that purpose. We will stay there again for sure."
12,1509,"Aug 29 2009 	Stylish hotel with a few minor glitches	We stayed in the 'Presedential Suite' but was a little dissapointed that, despite assurances from the booking agent that the room had two seperate bedrooms, it only had a single bedroom. We complained so they reduced the rate. The room was very hot as the AC was not working and it was August. The maintenance man came to fix it, but gave up after about 30 minutes. Then it suddenly started working??? The Sofa bed was very tough to assemble as they had packed it up, fully made. When we checked our credit card bill weeks later, we saw that the hotel did not reduce the rate as promised. These problems aside the room was very spacious and well appointed. We liked the wooden floors and the bathroom was pretty impressive....for a Holiday Inn. The room came with two large flatscreens which was a nice touch. Breakfast was just OK. The hotel is new and it has a very modern feel about it."
13,1509,"Aug 23 2009 	stumbled upon this hotel	On a roadtrip to Montreal, we had planned to not have a plan at all and stumbled upon this hotel near the airport. Most of the hotels in the city charge extra for parking and we preferred to not have to pay for parking. Therefore when we found this hotel we opted quickly to book a room. The hotel is located near the airport and luckily the drive into town takes about 20 minutes which is not too bad at all. The room itself was clean, spacious with two twin beds, and with modern amenities and totally perfect for at least 4 people traveling together. The one complaint I would have is that the windows did not keep out the noise of nearby trucks driving by in the middle of the night, which was a minor inconvenience. In the morning, the breakfast was pretty good, I would say a small step above the standard continental breakfast. Some hot dishes like bacon, eggs, and sausages were served along with the standard breads and cereals. Lastly, the hotel seems really new and their facilities are quite modern and clean, case in point the restrooms in the lobby were comparable to ones found in higher end hotels."
14,1509,Aug 21 2009 	Its the perfect hotel!	This hotel not only has great prices but great service as well. Everything was perfectly clean. I would definitely stay here again!
15,1509,"Aug 11 2009 	perfect when you want to be close from Dorval	We had a great time there the room are spotless, Breakfast is complementary. Parking is free fro resident. You will not miss your plane as it is 10 mins away from Dorval. they have ashuttle service and a big screen which flight departure information."
16,1509,"Aug 10 2009 	what an excellent hotel it deserve at least 4 stars	I will certainly recommend this hotel to my network... Simply because it offers the best Quality/Price Ratio. Adding to that, it's a brand new stuff with qualified people trying every thing possible to let you feel home."
17,1509,"Aug 9 2009 	We have finally found our Montreal home away from home!	With it's comfy new beds and hardwood floors, this hotel catered to our needs. Our 11 month old son could crawl on the floor without us wondering whether it was clean (like we would if it was carpet). There was plenty of space in the suite for all 4 of us. It was clean, clean, clean! The free breakfast was delightful and our sons enjoying the swimming pool while my husband enjoyed the gym. The staff were also very friendly and helpful."
18,1509,"Aug 5 2009 	Clean Comfortable - Not close to anything	We stayed in a King suite which was very upscale in decor. Two flat screen TV's, laminate floors and a hudge bath with a glassed in shower.The bed was comfortable and the room spacious. The only thing we did not like is the A/C was loud and seemed to operate only on high speed. It was alright for sleeping but the TV had to be turned up too loud to suit me. Also there was a pool of water on the floor the next moring where the A/C had not been draining properly. I turned the unit off and reported that to the management at check-out.The staff speaks clear English which is nice because we don't speak French. Not speaking French makes driving in Quebec tricky. Luckily, our GPS took us through a maze of roads to this hotel. I don't know if we could have found it without GPS. The location seem convenient to the airport but not much else. That was OK for us since we were only passing through town on the way somewhere else.If you've had one HIE breakfast, you've had the majority of them. On rare occasions one will stand out. This was not one of those rare occasions."
19,1509,"Jul 15 2009 	Terrific value!	My family accompanied me on a trip to Montreal for business, as we mixed in some family fun at the same time. Great hotel - nice new rooms, great pool, nice lobby, and polite, courteous staff. The breakfast buffet might have been the best feature - the food was excellent, and having it right there, and free with the room, saves you a ton of time and money. The price on the rooms was very competitive, and great value. We would definitely stay here again."
20,1509,"Jul 13 2009 	Perfect for park and fly!	We stayed at this hotel overnight before flying out on vacation the next day from Dorval airport. We were a party of 2 adults, 2 teenagers and 1 6-month old baby. Rooms are great, large enough to accommodate all of us comfortably, had a mini-fridge, microwave and coffee maker (super handy with the baby), nice big bathroom, very clean. Free WIFI was also a big bonus for us given the kids had brought along their laptops ;-) Hardwood floors throughout the room, which I really appreciate. The hotel parked not only one, but two cars for us given that my husband and I had to drive down separately. There was free shuttle service the next morning at our convenience (no pre-set times, you reserve it the night before and its 24h service). We had to be out by 7.30h am, and had time to enjoy the complimentary breakfast buffet, which features hot items (eggs, bacon, sausage) and had a nice assortment of cereal, toast, yogurt etc. I was very pleasantly surprised by the breakfast buffet, as these are usually limited to stale croissants and toast. We enjoyed the pool the night before, and ordered out for pizza. I realised afterward that they had a nice selection of catered frozen meals for sale in the little shop downstairs, and would surely have tried that for a more healthy selection had I known. Staff was friendly and relaxed, including the shuttle driver (its just a short drive over to the airport, which is great). They came to pick us up as soon as we called from the airport on our way back, and getting our cars was easy and fast.Bottom line, you can't get better value than this hotel, especially if you are doing park and fly. It makes for a really easy and enjoyable experience. I am for sure going to do this every time I'm flying out of Montreal. You just can't go wrong with this place, especially given the very decent rates."
21,1509,"Jul 13 2009 	more than you pay for	In June 2009, I want to Holiday Inn Express Hotel &amp; Suite, at Montreal Airport. I was really surprise of what you get for the price. The room are clean and really nice. They don't have carpets on the floor and the room are big. You have a breakfast include and you have quite some choice, even tough is an &quot;expres&quot; breakfast. Coffee and tea are free 24h/day.There's a pool and a nice lobby to relax. You have acess to two computers (free) with wireless internet. The internet is free and pretty fast.Bathroom are clean and nice towels.There is a shuttle that take you to the airport. Altough we didn't stay to catch a plane, it's a good place to stay if you don't want to pay the full price (dowtown montreal).There no restaurants around, but you can ask for deliveries."
22,1509,"Jul 12 2009 	Excellent for park and fly!	We stayed here before leaving for our trip to take advantage our their stay and park option. We were very impressed with the rooms and the service. Breakfast was great, but usual HI fare. The shuttle to and from the ariport was very convenient. We would definitely stay here again if we were travelling from Montreal."
23,1509,"Jun 14 2009 	They try harder - and succeed!	This facility was built in late 2008 and makes for a delightful stay. It's a little pricey, but so are all the hotels in that area. The facility is modern and perfect in every way, but it's the staff that takes it over the top. They take the time to fully explain all the amenities with each guest at checkin, and are responsive to any questions or problems. The complimentary breakfast tops anything I've seen at other hotels. The hotel is convenient to the airport and only 12 miles from downtown. It's in a light industrial area, which is the only thing I can think of as a negative. They have plenty of parking in a gated lot. I would not only recommend this hotel, I'll make it my choice in the Montreal area."
24,1509,Jun 12 2009 	Great experience...no complaints	From the time I arrived till I left the experience was great.The room had hardwood...perfect...no dust...bright and the room was spotless.I was able to arrange for shuttle services twice without issue so that I could spend the day in downtown Montreal.I highly recommend this location....staff was great...DA
25,1509,"Jun 8 2009 	Fantastic for Business Travelers	This Holiday Inn Express fulfilled every single need I had for a top-notch business hotel. With time at a premium, the hotel was able to accommodate me in every way, providing great service and rooms all within tight time constraints. Best of all, I was able to zip right over to the airport for my flight once my stay was over. Highly recommended."
26,1509,Jun 7 2009 	Hip hotel with gorgeous rooms	I booked the hotel for its proximity to the airport and to accumulate my priority points. As a business traveller I have stayed at Holiday Inns all over North America. I have never seen rooms or amenities like this. The rooms are clean and sleek - mine came with two flat screens TVs. The hardwood floors were a great touch. I felt like I was in a uber-trendy boutique hotel in a cities downtown entertainment district. I highly recommend the hotel.
27,1509,"May 25 2009 	Absolutely Beautiful Hotel	We stayed overnight at this hotel on May 2nd. We didn't arrive until after 10pm and were back to the airport very early the next morning to catch another plane. I have stayed at many Holiday Inn Express hotels but I must say this is the nicest one I have ever stayed in. The room was beautiful, I even took pictures to specifically post here. The hallways were lovely and very wide. The lobby was beautiful and the staff were very friendly. I would recommend this hotel."
28,1509,Apr 29 2009 	Impressive!	I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Hotel &amp; Suites Montreal Airport. All I can say is wow! All rooms have laminate flooring with modern furniture. Extremely comfortable bed with flat screen tv. Complimentary wireless internet and full breakfast! Some hotels should be ashamed of charging for these in this day and age! Congratulations Holiday Inn Express! 100% better than the Hilton Montreal Airport! Try it... you won't be disappointed!
29,1509,"Apr 21 2009 	Beautiful Hotel and Genuine Service	I stayed at this brand new hotel for one night the first week of April.The hotel product is beautiful! Contemporary, clean and comfortable.I was welcomed by John (evening Night Audit) and was pleasently surprised. Great genuine service and felt reassured that I was at a great hotel right away.Since it is an Express hotel there is not a restaurant onsite, however; the hotel offers an excellent selection of frozen entrees and even offers wine and beer from thier pantry. Very handy.The Breakfest Bar was consistent with all other Holiday Inn Expresses and the Breakfest Bar Hostess was very friendly. The best part of my morning though was when John (the same John that checked me in) came by to see how my evening was and wished me a good day. He even remembered my name!Great hotel, genuine service. I will be back."
30,1509,"Mar 19 2009 	My Airport Choice Everytime from NOW ON!	Not sure how this hotel only has a 2.5 star rating, it is easily a 4 star! I was more than impressed with the room I had, this is a brand new hotel. King size bed, wireless internet, hardwood floors and flat screen TV with High Def channels. The front desk staff was amazing, arranged my free shuttle to the airport, and the wake up call I needed. The free breakfast was great, full service with eggs and everything else to start my day right!This is easily one of the best and affordable airport hotels Ive stayed at in a long time. Definitely the place to stay at the Dorval Airport!"
31,1509,"Mar 14 2009 	Very Nice HI Express	Stayed here for 3 day meeting, close to airport but very hard to get to because of the road design. We rented a car, could see the hotel, but could find a way to get to it. Finally saw the hotel shuttle and followed it through the back roads. Otherwise very new, clean and spacious Holiday Inn. Hotel room had a very comfortable king bed, large bathroom with shower (no tub), microwave, mini-fridge and coffee maker, free wi-fi. Very strange, the wardrobe is inadequate, with only space for hooks, no rod. Felt like the designers added this in at the last minute. Lobby is spacious, nice size breakfast area with hot breakfast included. Several business meeting rooms are available and nice size with windows. Food is catered in and very good and plentiful. Adequate 24 hour fitness centre and also a swimming pool and sauna room. Service was friendly and great. ATe at Forcaccio near the hotel which had nice homemade Italian food at very reasonable prices. Went to Latin Quarters, Alos another night and the food was fantastic."
32,1509,"Mar 4 2009 	Great experience at this hotel	Stayed here recently for a &quot;sleep, park and fly&quot;. We were two families with small children (including a baby). The hotel accomodated our request for rooms nearby to one another and also the request for a crib for baby. This hotel is new and it shows. Very modern and clean. Great big, comfy beds and just overall a super nice hotel. We caught the shuttle both to and from the airport and it was hassle free and conveniant. Front desk staff were pleasant and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel for park and fly purposes."
33,1509,"Feb 16 2009 	Ultimate comfort and service!	The only downside to this hotel is the French only road signs! :DThis hotel was amazing, I was impressed with everything. It has hardwood flooring, it is very modern and very stylish, huge lobby, clean and super comfortable from the bed all the way to the soft towels. They really exceeded the HI Express standards in terms of design. I currently am working in a HI-Express so trust this review !!!The staff was amazing as well, very warm and were quick to give us directions to anywhere and did not hesitate to ask how everything with our room was every time we passed by. Jacki and Russel in particular were great and gave outstanding service ! Thanks guys!I recommend this hotel to anyone."
34,1509,Dec 21 2008	Great Hotel! Next to Montreal Trudeau Airport.	This is a great hotel. I recommend it without hesitation. Here are some highlights:- Brand new construction and very clean- 2 Minutes from the airport terminal- Nicely designed lobby- Spacious conference roomsThis is definitively the best choice for a hotel near the Montreal Airport.
35,1509,Aug 27 2009 	Hotel bellissimo assolutamente consigliato.
36,1509,Dec 19 2008	Top Hotel !!!
1,1511,"Oct 12 2009 	Great hotel	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Airport last month while visiting my parents in Montreal for their anniversary. We arrived Friday night, my daughters immediately loved the pool and games area with its tropical atmosphere. The restaurant even had a terrace overlooking the pool area. We liked it so much that Saturday we decided to have dinner at the hotel instead of a restaurant for my parent's anniversary.The food was very good and at a decent price. The rooms were nice and clean and the staff was very friendly. I will definetely stay there again on my next visit to Montreal."
2,1511,"Oct 10 2009 	Different experience	Some friends and I spent a night at this hotel before leaving the next day for New Brunswick. We were taking the train so we decided to stay close to the train station which is just minutes away from the airport. We were surprised when we were walking to our rooms. It felt like we were on some Tropical island. Very cool, very different. We had a swim; the lifeguard was a nice guy, very helpful. Really nice staff, all in all. We would go back anytime."
3,1511,"Sep 2 2009 	Repeat Stay	I started staying at this hotel years ago while on business.But now I only travel with my son on vacations, this is the only hotel I use in Montreal. The pool &amp; games area keeps him busy &amp; the food is #1."
4,1511,"Aug 29 2009 	perfect for the airport the next day	We booked this as we needed to drop our car off at the airport and catch a flight the next day. Location was fine. staff very nice. We had a nice room, comfy bed. The outside pool area was also nice."
5,1511,"Aug 26 2009 	perfect stay	We really liked it here, there are two swimming pools, a fitness, and the shuttle service to the airport works very well. The food in the restaurant was very well, also a great vegatarian dish. We could relax here before our flight to Amsterdam and our room was near the swimming pool. Also the room had everything we needed, and the reception was very nice to us."
6,1511,"Aug 9 2009 	First time there and last	We stayed there 2 nights and had 2 rooms. The room that our teenagers stayed in was smelling awful, the coffee percolator was not working. Our room looked ok however it needs painting and the walls are dirty.When I mentioned this to the agent on duty when we checked out (that the room was smelly) he did not apologize at all, like it was normal. Perhaps the bar, restaurant and pool area look good but the rooms need to be spruced up. I will not return there for sure."
7,1511,"Jul 22 2009 	wonderful experience	We read the reviews on this site the night before our stay and almost ended up cancelling. I'm glad we didn't as this was one of the nicest hotel stays for us. We traveled with 2 families, 15 people in all. We were slightly nervous about what to expect, but just until we got there. The check in was effortless, our room was very nice. It faced the atrium, but there certainly wasn't any musty smell. The rooms, at least in this part of the hotel, seem to have gone through a recent reno. The atrium is beautiful - real tropical plants, birds, fish tank, games to play and places to just sit and enjoy. We ended up having dinner just after 8 o'clock and were very pleasantly surprised when our waiter told us that they will keep the pool open longer just so that we could still have our swim. I love that the hotel has a life guard - we travel quite a bit and I have never seen one in any other hotel. The pool was lovely, hot tub was not working, but it was not missed. The next morning we enjoyed a lovely breakfast and then a swim in the outdoor pool - water temperature was amazing. The staff were all wonderful, the place is clean and all in all this was a very enjoyable stop over. I was amazed at the room rates at this place. Would definitely stay there again should we end up in Montreal."
8,1511,"Jun 7 2009	Don't stay here	We were staying here due to a one-night layover. Upon entering my room I was overwhelmed by a strong musty smell. There were duvets on the beds without duvet covers instead there was a sheet on top and one on the bottom of the duvet. Although a large shuttle was available to pick up the 20 some guests from the airport, there were only 5 spots available on the morning shuttles(one came every half hour). After getting a busy signal when trying to make a local call I called the front desk to ask if there was a problem. I was informed that this was because they didn't have my credit card number and that local calls cost 84 cents per call. This was NOT mentioned upon check in. Overall a bad experience. I will never stay here again."
9,1511,"May 18 2009 	Great Overnighter In Montreal	The Holiday Inn Montreal Airport, with such negative reviews on TripAdvisor, was a bit of a risk when choosing to stay there. We were happily surprised.It was our first trip to Montreal and we weren't at all familiar with the area. We were overnighting in Montreal en-route to Las Vegas. Upon arriving at the Pierre Trudeau Airport, it proved fairly easy to find the free shuttle they offer to their guests. It was quick, easy and released some of the nerves from being in a new city.Check-in was prompt and efficient. The wonderful lady even helped us figure out how to take transit into downtown Montreal. She also set up a reservation for the complimentary shuttle the next morning, as we had an early flight out of Montreal.The room was wonderful and hospitable. All the furniture and fixtures appeared to be new. The only thing that required updating were the old and stained carpets. This property also has a really neat pool area, tropical themed. We didn't have a chance to go for a swim, but looked like plenty of fun!Overall, it was a great overnighter in Montreal. This hotel met all of our needs and we found the complimentary shuttle to be a huge help."
10,1511,"Apr 22 2009 	Needs Updating	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Airport for 2 nights and attended a family group function in the dining room of the Holiday Inn. Restaurant staff were amazing and very accomodating. Although we had requested to hold our event on their &quot;patio&quot; the restaurant manager had indicated that it was unavailable as they had to get it ready for a later event. this actually didn't happen till much later after our group left, therefore we could have had use of it.Front desk is extremely slow. 3/4 people behind desk, but only one person can actually serve guests and he flies around trying to help everyone at the same time. took us about 15-20 minutes to check in.rooms are really outdated. need new paint and upgrading in bathrooms. really thin walls to adjoining rooms and hallway. corridors smell &quot;smokey&quot; even though we were in no smoking area. windows need cleaninglow cost but low quality accomodations. rooms/hallways need to be cleaned, painted and updated.geat location if you need to do things in west end of Montreal. just off of highway which leads to downtown. close to malls and airport"
11,1511,"Apr 21 2009 	Try another hotel	Pros:Close to airport.Cons:1. An old style motel converted into a hotel by adding a new front section, putting a roof over the car park and adding a swimming pool and some plastic plants....sad!!2. Sullen, grumpy and unhelpful staff.3. Food barely passable, poor choice on the buffet, cold coffee. Ended up going to Le Bifteque across the highway for something decent the second night.4. Close to railway marshalling yard...nothing beats being woken up during the night as trains are being put together for the following day.5. Fixtures and fittings in the bathroom were hanging off.6. No elevator although it seems they are putting one in.7. At night the bar has no life, ended up going to the hotel next door for a few drinks, welcoming staff and warm atmoshpere."
12,1511,Jan 17 2009 	Seasoned Business Traveler says STAY AWAY!	First of all the front desk personnel were not friendly or helpful. The parking lot was not plowed due to heavy snow. Terrrible ordeal trying to park and back out! My room heater was noisy and not working efficiently. The room was COLD. Was told that in the morning someone would take care of this. Cold air was seeping through all the heater fixtures! This was my worst hotel stay ever and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
13,1511,"Dec 28 2008 	Why OH why didn't I listen??	In four words - 'do not stay here'.We arrived at 1205AM and I phoned and was told the shuttle was finished for the night. Paid 20.00 for a cab. There are a lot of other hotels, the Hampton, the new Loft (same price point), and the Hilton - its more but probably worth it. I am not a hotel snob and know you get what you pay for, but this hotel does not deliver in any sense. To the almost 45 minute wait to get checked in, (and to my amusement - other guests being given rooms twice with someone already sleeping in them!) then to be told -nowhere in the vicinity can I buy cigarettes - no the bar is closed (it was a Sat night) - no you cannot have shuttle for 6AM or 7AM or 730AM the next morning. Hence another 20.00 cab ride back. Got to the room - very very Motel 6 (although that would be better) but the bathroom was not cleaned probably. Really, for 100.00/night - I at least expect the [-] to be cleaned from the toilet bowl!!! I then decided I needed at least a can of coke. Two pop machines did not work - the one that did was out of coke. Thirty minutes later I decided I should be grateful for my can of Sprite.The decor is dated, the staff disorganized and to add injury to insult, the hotel is not even that close to the airport!!Heed my warnings - DO NOT STAY HERE - its a scum-pit!!Slocker"
14,1511,Dec 18 2008 	Good Deal. Indifferent Staff. Miserable shuttle driver.	The hotel itself is comfortable and the indoor atrium with the pool is really nice (we stayed here December 14th). The staff however are a different story. The front desk person was indifferent and bordering on rude. I asked the attendant in the exercise room what time they closed and he told me 10 pm (it was before 9 pm when I asked). When I returned 10 minutes later (still before 9 pm) it was closed and locked. In the morning when we were getting on the shuttle the driver scolded us for having too much luggage (we had 2 suitcases each due to traveling with our scuba equipment). Our response was not pleasant and it shut him up however I can think of better ways to start the day.On the upside their park and fly deal is excellent and the shuttle was on time and efficient.
15,1511,"Dec 8 2008 	A dump	The definition of a [--]. Smells bad , dirty , very cheap look to it , bad service. My door key needed to be reprogrammed each time I used it . And the frontdesk people would each time look very surprised that it did not work properly as if I was to blame for that.Do not confuse with the Holiday Inn Express which is down the road and appears to be a much better place."
16,1511,"Nov 23 2008 	Not as abad as I thought	Booked this through Priceline for 60$US all included, so around 75$CAN. I was really scared when I saw the ratings and was expecting the worse.The location itslef is pretty crummy, on Cote de Liesse, not close to any metro station, but by car, its about 20 minutes to downtown, and maybe 5 minutes to Namur Station (plenty of street parking). The area is industrial (well, this is an airport hotel)....The facility is definitely old school motel, 2 storeys, with 2 courtyards, one which has been covered for the jungle atrium seen in the hotels photos. A bit tacky but probably fun for the kids. This looks like it was last renovated in the 80s. Front service was friendly and attentive. A good portion of the hotel is being renovated. We ended in a renovated room with a confortable king bed (was supposed to get 2 double beds, but we checked inn late, so we managed to get a room with a king). The room was smallish, as any Holiday Inn, and the bathroom also, but it was clean and in good shape, with good shower pressure. Plastic glasses. Parking is free. A restaurant on premise offer a breakfast buffet for 12$CAN. Priority club members receive a free drink voucher for the bar. Overall, this was a decent room, in a typical airport environment. For people in transit, or people with car. Would come back again for a similar deal."
17,1511,"Oct 3 2008 	Underwhelmed (if that's a word)	Stayed here on business, needing a place near the airport. Wouldn't do it again. Hotel is dated (looks like a converted motel), bathroom fixtures and decor were very old, and no elevator to go to the second floor. Once I got to the second floor, it was a long distance walk to my room (at the back of the property).For the money, I would not stay here ever again."
18,1511,Sep 29 2008 	Never Again	After travelling for 7 weeks around Canada this was our final night before departing. Up until this time we'd had no problems with our accommodation. That was until we had people come into our room at 1:00am and then again at 1:30am looking for friends. These rooms are only accessible with a door key!! The hotel staff offered little in the way of sympathy or compensation for our ideal and my mum and I left the city disgusted.
19,1511,"Sep 14 2008 	A mixed bag	We booked this hotel for a one night stay while we visited Montreal.The good:1) The public areas are quite nice.2) The staff went out of their way for us.The bad:1) It's in an industrial area. There are hardly any restaurants, and the area is comprised of a couple of airport hotels and numerous industrial buildings. 2) It's a decent drive (20 minutes or more) from downtown, and traffic can be a problem.3) The bathrooms are terrible. They are small and old.4) The rooms are in serious need of a makeover.5) The indoor pool shares space with banquets and their restaurant. The kiddie pool was filthy.I don't think that we would stay here again. It was just too far from downtown, and the rooms did not make up for the distance. Nonetheless, the staff should really be congratulated. We had a couple of issues that they went out of their way to help us with. (Left and item in the room, asked for directions, etc.)"
20,1511,"Aug 27 2008 	Appalling customer service - AVOID!	I stayed at this hotel when my flight to London was delayed. From the start the staff were unfriendly. Check in took ages, despite several staff members seemingly doing nothing behind the counter. The room itself was dingy, musty and old fashioned. The bar staff were incredibly rude - literally just shrugging when we asked them anything! My vegetarian pizza had ham over one corner of it which was the kind of sloppy attitude we experienced throughout the hotel. The receptionist was lazy and unhelpful. We overheard other guests complaining about their stay but again the staff just ignored them, their attitude was that nothing was their problem.Also - the hotel doesn't have a lift! How bizarre for an airport hotel when most guests will have lots of luggage! I would really recommend that you avoid this hotel."
21,1511,Aug 20 2008 	avoid	This hotel is bad for a holiday inn. Our problems started at check inn. We arrived in Montreal after a trip to california from the UK. Our flight to london meant we had a 12 hour stop in Montreal. We called the Hotel from the airport and they agreed they had a room for the day for 4 adults and agreed a price. After a long wait for the shuttle bus we arrived to be told we couldnt have the 1 room but they only had 2. There was no apology or concern she was very rude and abrupt. She blamed the mis information on her colleague who was checking in another group. She then suggested if we wanted to argue we could deal with him. I agreed and said i would like to speak to the person i made the agreement with over the phone..not argue as i pointed out. I spoke to George who aske for our credit card and proceeded to check us in to the room and rates we agreed on the phone. She then decided to interrupt and pointed out that her colleague was making a mistake and shouldnt be giving us the rooms whilst she was serving another guest. her manner from the start was rude and it appeared she had issues with her colleague who remained very proffessional throughout. After this we found the rooms very dated and the whole place was unpleaseant. Im not one to complain but this was atrocious for a Holiday Inn. I expected a whole lot more for the prices they chrge. I will also be making a formal complaint against the female member of staff.
22,1511,"Aug 19 2008 	Rooms smell horrible	We stayed at this hotel through an airline voucher when our flight was cancelled. I know the hotel was busy at that time, but the first room we were given had an overwhelmingly smoky and musky smell. The kind of smell that permeates everything and ferments over twenty years in the carpets, drapes, etc. We asked for a new room, but the second one was just as bad-smelling. On top of that, the check-in staff were rude, the bathroom was dirty and all our clothing stunk badly when we got home. I would say this is barely a two star hotel. Definitely not recommended."
23,1511,Aug 16 2008	car stolen from parking lot	This hotel has a definite safety issue - a car was stolen from the parking lot in August 2008. Right near airport so very noisy.Unfourtunately this hotel is being marketed to US youth sports teams as an ideal place to stay during a tournament. - don't stay here.
24,1511,"Jul 25 2008 	Denied me buffet breakfast!	My husband and I checked in last July 20,2008 .This is a company paid training and therefore I had to take a vacation for a month to be with him and relax. The front desk gave us the breakfast stub for 1 month and all of my stubs has a checked mark on the buffet part. Also, all of the stubs has a cross out on the room # and the new room # is reflected there. In my 3rd breakfast day while I was eating and taking my 3rd bite, waiter approached me and said who gave you this list? I said my husband gave it to me and the receptionist did. He said I should not be taking buffet breakfast and only continental. He also asked me if I changed rooms bec there is a cross there. I said I did not change rooms. He asked me also my name, my husband's name. The way he asked me questions has bothered me a lot bec it seems that I was the one who erased the room #. Why will I do that???to get buffet meals??Also, it is very rude to say that I should get continental when he sees I am already eating those eggs, bacon. Also, why will he ask me who gave me the stub??Cant he check with reception??I felt so embarrassed that I left the restaurant without finishing my breakfast. I called front desk to complain and they said it should just be continental. Front desk also told me that I should have approached the restaurant mgr there and then to fix my problem. Hello? I never got an apology from the mgr in duty. I went down to show him all my stubs and front desk admitted they made a mistake. Restaurant mgr and another boss called me to apologize but to my dismay, I will not eat in their restaurant again. I am left with all these stubs with me. And yes while I am writing this experience, I am still in this hotel. I hope I can change hotel since I will be stuck here for a month!"
25,1511,"May 28 2008 	Not that good	I was stuck in Montreal for 1 night due to flight cancellations. I therefore needed to stay near the airport and was trying to find a room at 8pm. The Hilton and the Four Points Sheraton were both booked out but I thought Holiday Inn had a certain standard it had to live up to so I booked this for $130 including tax.The free shuttle from the airport to the hotel was appreciated. The service at the front desk was excellent and very friendly. However, the room was below average. There was hair in the sink and the toilet seat was not clean. TV reception wasn't clear. The rooms have 2 doors - 1 to a corridor and the other to the indoor pool, which meant a fairly noisy atmosphere. The rooms are tired and dated and in need of renovation. Additionally, the alarm clock was not set to the right time, which I would expect - it was 12 hours off and therefore looked as if it was the right time. Luckily I had set the alarm on my cell phone as well, or I would have missed my flight.If stuck at Montreal again, I'll find somewhere else to stay."
26,1511,"Feb 3 2008	Terrible Hotel	This hotel is very bad. The service at the front desk and in the restaurant is horrible. The room needed some renovation. They decided to close the pool at 7:00pm when it was supposed to close at 9:00pm. The parking is full of ice, it's very dangerous. There was a private party in the atrium till midnight, couldn't get to sleep."
27,1511,"Sep 5 2007 	Worst Hotel I have Stayed In	Candidly, I expect that I won't get a good room when I book on Priceline- but this hotel was horrible. Priceline had it at 3 stars- it was barely 2. This place is allegedly being renovated- and the room we stayed in needed it.There were mosquitos in the room- 30 or 40. (AND NO OPENING WINDOWS). The bathroom had black stains that had been caulked over multiple times. There was an access hatch in the ceiling and the plaster around it was rotting and falling. The Air conditioner sounded like a train- which was good because it masked the road noise with a consistant loud noise. The only pros- the sheets were very clean- and there was free wireless internet. They gave me a free drink- although I really needed 12 to make this place acceptable."
28,1511,"Aug 16 2007 	This is more of a 2.3 Star Hotel	I'm upset about trip advisor not publishing my previous posting because it said I wrote to much about the surrounding city in additional to the hotel.That being said I'll keep this one short and leave out the photos.The hotel is undergoing major renovations to the majority of it's rooms.Stayed for a week. It's located about 4km from the airport, and 18km from downtown. I had no problems with parking and no one broke in to my vehicle.Booked via priceline, it was a good value but I'd give the current rating as 2.3 out of 5. You need to rent a car if you're going to be staying at this hotel. There is a free shuttle that goes to the airport every 30 minutes. There is also free wireless internet access.The mall which has a movie theater, and numerous dining choices is located about 5 minutes from the hotel, just north of 40, (don't get on 40) it's just north."
29,1511,"Jul 16 2007	Awful	We arrived from Barrie ON, to attend the opening game of FIFA U20, at noon on June 30th. There was no one in front of me at the check in, and still it took about 10 minutes for the clerk to start talking to me... It took 20 min. total to get the key. Room, small, bathroom smaller! Sink in the hallway. Old and musty. Bathtub not draining, dirty. Room on the ground floor exit into the hall on one side and onto the pool area and restaurant patio on the other. Requested more towels, got them hours later. During the evening there is a party and dancing in the restaurant patio. (no one mentioned it when I checked in) Nice dance music, but not when you got up at 4.00 am the previous morning! Very loud! After 3 calls to the front desk and numerous requests to be moved to a different room, long after 2am, we finally fell asleep in the same room. Nice setting for the indoor pool, but kids reported the water to be dirty and smelly!. Oh, and one last thing... bed bugs! STAY AWAY!"
30,1511,"Jul 12 2007	Bed bugs - Do not Stay.	We only stayed there one night. We booked two rooms as we have a rather large family. One of the rooms must have had bed bugs or something because those who slept in that bedroom had bug bites all over their faces and necks. To be honest and fair - we didn't actually see any bugs.The room with the bed bugs had a good shower. The other room the shower was damaged because the water dripped out slowly. So we all took showers in the room of with bed bugs. The hotel is being remodelled. In order to get to the main lobby, we had to walk through a hall way with tools and materials placed along the wall. Local phone calls are not free. Location is horrible. It was far from all of the major attractions that we visited. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
31,1511,"Jul 8 2007	Bad Hotel...no security	I stayed at this hotel when my daughter had a softball tournament in Montreal. For starters it was not very safe you did not need your key to swipe the doors to get in at all. Most of the doors to get in the hotel were broke. This was a big problem considering cars were being stolen and broken into from the property all day and night long. I did not feel safe at all especially having 3 teams of teenage girls there. Hotel was not clean. The best part of this hotel is what they show on line the indoor pool area. Food was terrible in this hotel. Hotel was booked and they had two waiters on in the Restaurant took 2hrs for our food and it was cold and nasty. Will never stay here again or Monteal Canda..by the time our group left we were there 3 nights we had 2 stolen cars, 1 laptop and 1 wallet stolen and 1 Car almost stolen theives were interrupted...This hotel and Montreal suck..."
32,1511,Jun 25 2007	Nasty and below expectations	We are long-time Priority Club members but will not be staying at anymore Holiday Inns that we are not already familiar with. The quality is too inconsistent. The carpet was soiled from a spill. The box spring had a visible soiled place. One pillow had an offensive odor. We received poor directions to our second floor room from the desk clerk and had a difficult time finding our room as we traveled with our luggage upstairs and downstairs (no elevator).
33,1511,"Jun 19 2007 	the slowest check-in process ever	It took 20 minutes to check in at 10:00 on a Wednesday night. There were 2 people in front of me and just one person at the desk. During the next 20 minutes a queue rapidly formed behind me.The check-in clerk was having problems with the computer system. Frustratingly there were at least 4 people visible through the translucent glass in the office behind the desk. Nobody came to help.I found I had been allocated a smoking room despite requesting no-smoking. When at 11:30pm, I went back to the desk to get my room changed, it took another 20 minutes to get a non-smoking room.Apart from that, the accommodation was OK, the car park had plenty of space and it was really nice that the restaurant was open until 23:00"
34,1511,"Jun 7 2007 	Great Place To Stay	Despite some very bad reviews we took the chance (rates were lower than anywhere else, particularly when we prepaid our five night stay!)All I can say it was a great stay, rooms were comfortable and clean, air conditioning in top shape, plenty of towels and toiletries and room made up up promptly.The pool was great and the help at the reception desk to get us in and out, and over Cote de Liesse Road???!! was excellent. They advised us on tours, food was great, and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. Shuttle bus was quick, friendly and efficient.We will definitely stay there again when next we visit Montreal."
35,1511,"May 8 2007	beware of park`n fly !!!!!	I booked that hotel so i could leave my pick up at the hotel parking because i didn`t want to leave it at the airport. I was going away for 1 month. To my big surprise i thought that was weired that they did`nt want to keep my pick up keys!! They didn`t even want to have my license plate number. So when i got back from my wonderfull trip, my truck was GONE !!!! the hotel was no help at all and i will NEVER stay there again. The rooms are verry old and have a funny smell. The bar is open late so you can have a drink before leaving for your vacation out of Dorval airport. The cost of one beer is $6.00 plus tip, so we only had 2 !! loLRemember if you want to leave your car there with the park`n fly package, go somewhere else where they will take your keys and license plate number. I had to book another flight to go home."
36,1511,"Mar 24 2007 	Absolutely Pathetic Dump	Whatever you do, DO NOT STAY HERE!!! This review is long and detailed, as I don't want anyone else to experience what we did. I will start off by saying that I am from Montreal, but now reside in Ottawa. My girlfriend and I were flying south for a week from Montreal, so our travel agent booked us here for one night. It seemed convenient, with free parking for up to 28 days with one night stay (this is too good to be true and I should have suspected something), and an airport shuttle service. In my opinion, this hotel is a fraud.Firstly, it is not an &quot;airport&quot; hotel. It is on Cote de Liesse near the Decarie expressway, which is a long way from the airport. To be exact, it is a $20 cab ride. I know this because their &quot;shuttle service&quot; is a joke and we had to get a taxi. Where to begin...We checked in and the extremely rude receptionist demanded the confirmation number, even though you would think a name would suffice. In any event, I went out to the car and retrieved the number. I then asked for a 6 a.m shuttle to the airport, and was told that it was full and that the next available shuttle was at 7 am. As our flight was leaving at 8:30 this was a little too tight. The lady at the desk seemed very unconcerned, and told me that since the weather was bad, the next day's flights were likely going to be delayed anyhow. Apparently during her breaks she moonlights as an air traffic controller. I asked how many spots they had on their &quot;shuttle' and was told it is an outside service they use, and only 10 spots are available, and since this was a busy time of day for flights it was already full. Here's a clue...if it's a typically busy time, get more (or bigger) vehicles. Anyhow, I wanted to stay somewhere else but it was getting late and we just wanted to chill out, so I asked what the room rate was if we didn't leave our car there. My intention was to drive ourselves to a Park and Fly in the morning and use their shuttle. The rate I was quoted was higher than what I was already being charged. They know they have you, so they scam you into having to stay there. But the best was yet to come...We went to our &quot;room&quot;...I use this term loosely, because it was a dump. Plain and simple, a youth hostel would have been better. Old, tired and dank. I called the front desk and asked for a wake-up call at 6 am. &quot;No problem&quot;. I also asked that a cab be called to attend the hotel at 6:30 and pick us up. Again, &quot;No problem&quot;. Not trusting them, I set the alarm in the room (which had a battery backup in case of power failure, but no battery in it!) as well as my watch. No wakeup call ever came, and no cab was called (we called one ourselves). Everything, from the sheets to the towels to the carpets and furnishings, is unclean, worn out or both. At checkout, I complained to the typically inept clerk about the service and asked to see the manager, whose name was posted on the wall as &quot;on duty'. Turns out he doesn't come in until noon, so I let the counter staff feel my frustration. As with the shuttle service and the wake-up call, he didn't work well either.So, to summarize, this is not an airport hotel. You are better off staying anywhere else. There are certain features an airport hotel should have, like a shuttle, a wake-up call and relative proximity to the airport. This place has none of the above. You almost need a connecting flight to get from here to the airport! It is not a Holiday Inn, but instead an independently run franchise operated by &quot;Hotels Cote de Liesse&quot; or something like that. Holiday Inn goes to great lengths to advertise this fact, as they know something we don't (yet). If there was a &quot;zero star&quot; rating possible I would give it to this joke of a building (I refuse to refer to it as a hotel). They have a clean and professional looking lobby, with a 4 star rating on the wall (that has to be fraud right there), but this is just the hook to get you to commit. I violated my own rule and failed to ask to see the room first, and I should have checked TripAdvisor beforehand. The name &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; fooled me, but never again. Therefore, if you do stay here, you do so at your own peril. Sleeping on an airport bench would be a preferable option."
37,1511,"Aug 31 2006 	What a dump!	First impression was good: nice lobby, attractive pool area. The room was very small and dingy. There was no fridge or microwave in the room, as advertised on the website. We were informed that we were supposed to request those ahead of time. We asked for another room. We waited over an hour for them to clean a room. When we moved, the room was extremely small, the bathroom was the size of a closet. The room was dirty, had wobbly furniture, and ripped carpet. When we turned on the microwave, most of the power in the room went out. It took 2 hours to fix. Staff seemed disorganized, told us the indoor pool was closed and we should go to the outdoor pool. We walked around to that pool and it was closed and padlocked. We packed and wanted to leave, but unfortunately had prepaid and we could not get a refund. Overall a terrible experience."
38,1511,"Jul 12 2006	Stay away!	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Aeroport Montreal for one night.This hotel is on a 12-lane(?) freeway.*Full of mold*Strong Perfume Smell*Springy Bed*Can't reach the front desk after several minutes on hold. In-person the lineup is long.*There's a light switch in the shower which is a huge electricution hazard*Tub feels like it's going to fall through the floor at any moment*Garbage and matresses stored throughout the outside courtyard to make it almost unuseable*Indoor Area smelled too much like mold to even walk through.. i prefered to use the back door near my hotel room to get around to the front even in thunder showers because the inside was too horrible*I could hear alarm buzzers at 3 and 4 in the morning from other rooms*Everything was sticky in my room*It smelled like puke and feces*No comment cards*No easy way to reach hotel managment*When calling InterContinental Relations, hold time over 20 minutes and they were only able to forward my comments to the hotel. They weren't willing to take ANY responsibility themselves even if the hotel carries their brand name.I spent almost $1000 at various holiday inns this week and this one spoiled my whole vacation on the last day. Left a very sour taste in my mouth.Comfort Inn (Choice Hotels) has been much better to me... I will continue to stay there as at least they seem to have some quality control."
39,1511,"Apr 19 2006 	With so many choices choose something else.	I wouldn't receommend this hotel unless you like tacky decor, poor customer service, and rooms that scream BLAH.My business colleague had stayed at this hotel before, and he had pretty good things to say about it. While he seemed to enjoy the place more than I, he will also not return to this hotel.First I found the service to be poor. Being there on business we needed access to a fax machine. We were ensured that we would have access to one, and they have a business centre. The business centre consists of a printer/fax/copy machine that doesn't fax, and a computer with internet access. I was told to fax on this machine by the man at the front desk, only to find out it wasn't a fax machine when I asked for help from a lady at the front desk (the man had gone home). This same woman offered to fax my report for me, but when I handed her the 35 pages I needed faxed, she said she couldn't do it for 2 hours. I had to ask for everything, including alternatives and directions to the Bureau Gros (Staples), She was not helpful at all, and she was very rude.The rooms were in poor condition. My colleague had a shower head that didn't work, and when I turned the taps on the water was brown. The high speed internet (Wireless) barely worked. When I asked the front desk they advised me to purchase a Cat 5 cable and plug it in for a better connection. Since I had to go to Bureau Gros anyways, I picked one up. When I returned to my room after a day of work, the cable didn't fit as it was for a phone cable. The staff were again unapologetic.The food at the hotel is not worth what you pay. The buffets (breakfast and dinner) were poor quality, and everything seemed overpriced. The indoor poor under the atrium, and the surrounding area will bring you back to the 70's when that hotel had style. Now, it needs to be renovated by a wrecking ball.Around Montreal's airports there are many choices that are much better in terms of value, and almost all are better in terms of quality. Do not be fooled, and avoid this hotel for whatever purpose you have in Montreal."
40,1511,"Oct 29 2005 	My 3rd stay here in as many years 	As I said, I've stayed here 3 times over 3 years now and I have no major complaints. The indoor atrium is very attractive and relaxing offering swimming, sauna and outdoor dining. Restaurant's good, bar's ok for a nitecap if desired and most importantly, the rooms are comfortable, clean and quiet. I don't know about you but even when in Montreal for business, I'm hardly ever in the room or at the hotel anyway because there's so many neat things to see and do and great places to eat. So, for the money I think it works OK.Just a few quick things; the internet connection in the business center is really slooooooow (they really need an updated computer) and it takes a little attention to how to get in and out of the place but other than that, nothing at all.You could do much worse, let me say it that way....."
41,1511,"Oct 26 2005 	Reasonable for the money but there are better options	Too the previous reviewers I would have to say, remember that this is a drive-up two story hotel in an airport location, not a downtown, tower hotel, and not a resort hotel. It makes no pretense at being either. It simply is what it is...fairly reasonable (for Montreal) accomodation, close to the airport. Free parking is included. Stayed in Room 333, a comfortable King room, with a really good bed. There were three of us, and no Priority Club upgrade available, because the only room choices are between two-doubles or one king room. All the doubles were booked so we had a cot brought to our room at no charge.Priority Club service provided me with a free drink, and breakfast buffet for two.The room is tired, and there is noise from airplanes, but other than that it was quiet and comfortable. Room service was typically expensive ($39 for 32 chicken wings), and I hate all the tax in Quebec, but overall an okay experience. There is an indoor and an outdoor pool, games area, and very nice exercise room. Everything was okay.After staying here, I would have to say, I will return to staying at the Best Western hotel at the entrance to Dorval airport -- better location, better price, better service. The service here was okay, but the staff did not make me feel valued as a guest. They did what was necessary and no more."
42,1511,"Aug 26 2005	Very Disappointed	We stayed at this hotel for two (2) nights in August 2005 because it is close to the airport and 15 minutes from the relatives that we were visiting. When we arrived, there was no bellboy available to help and we had to drag the luggage up as there are no elevators in the hotel. The room was not clean, not well lighted as bulbs were completely missing in some of the lamps. When I went by the window to look out I stood into a soaked carpet. This room needs to be renovated. The hallway had a bad odor and you coud hear noise coming from the next room. The next day we went out, although the housekeeping people were on the floor we came back to a dirty room. Since the phones were out of service, I had to walk to the reception to inquire as to why the room was not cleaned. Half an hour later, there was a knock at the door and housekeeping brought in towels, cleaned the bathroom but did not make the beds. This type of service is expected in a motel. As a Priority Club Member, I expected more from this hotel. Therefore, the price is not reasonable due to the lack of service. For all this inconvenience, I thought that the rate would have been reduced. The only good thing was the free parking as there is a fee in some hotels. What a disappointment!Room 229"
43,1511,"Jul 8 2005	Worst Hotel Ever	I stayed in this hotel with my wife and son in July of 2005 to attend a wedding next door at the 4 Points, which was sold out. It was a huge mistake. The staff is so rude and inconsiderate, and the shower head didi not work at all! On top of that, the refused to fix it. For 3 nights, we used a cup to pour water on ourselves to bathe. I will never stay at another Holiday Inn again."
44,1511,"Apr 2 2005	Never again! 	We just returned from one night at this Holiday Inn-which was one too many. The hotel seemed full of families, so obviously they are getting customers, but the fact that it has a FOUR star rating on its door is shocking to me..our room smelled bad, was dingy and dirty (cobwebs on the ceiling and curtains, water stains everywhere, shower curtain falling apart, etc etc) We had a view of the pool ..which was also disgusting. The pool was 1/4 full of green slime, and there was trash everywhere. The gym is dirty, overheated, and located in a spot where people wet from the pool run in and out constantly (not fun).. plus my husband and daughter went out for dinner at the hotel restaurant and paid almost 100$$ for 2 meals and a sandwich and coke for me! (oh yes, and they accept dogs too, so our neighbor had one that barked on and off all night ) The capper was when we told them (explicitly) we needed to catch an early shuttle for our flight, to which they said fine --it leaves at 6 am. We arrived a few minutes to 6--to find the shuttle gone and the front desk told us, &quot;oh, it already left and you were supposed to be here at five minutes to 6&quot;--which they DID NOT tell my husband when he spoke to them the night before. Then the manager suggests we just wait around until the next shuttle- 1/2 hour later (which would mean a possible missing of our flight) We were both furious, esp. as we had to take an expensive taxi to the airport (and the shuttle was one of the main reasons we even stayed at this hotel)Do NOT stay here if you have any other choice--it's a dump, overpriced, the service is inept-and clearly Holiday Inn has washed their hands of this place&gt;"
45,1511,Mar 16 2005	It has an atrium	So that give sit a couple of points. Many rooms surround an oddly lit pool/game area that tries to make you feel like you are in the tropics. It's alright. Makes a bland hotel something. It should be relatively cheap and the kids will get a kick out of it. By the airport if you're renting a car should work out just fine for a family on a budget.
46,1511,"Sep 1 2004	disgusting	This was possibly the worst hotel ever. After checking in we discovered that the toilet in the small dark and run down room we checked into didn't work. We called the front desk and they promised to move us to another room. The desk clerk arrived at our room with keys to a room in the back of the hotel with a view of the parking lot,we asked if we could remain in a room with a view of the pool,to this the clerk became very rude and told my husband she had already told him it was not facing the pool ( my husband is not stupid and was not told the room was at the back of the hotel but he apologized and asked if we could stay in a room facing the pool). 45 minutes later no new room husband called the front desk again as room we were to move to was next door and had been clean since we arrived. This time the manager came to our room and she is agressively rude, as she is standing in the doorway yelling at my husband I write down her name .(attitude change when she sees me do this). The next room is no better wallpaper peeling off walls hair in the bathroom, I counted 7 bandaides around the pool 2 ponytail holders and a hair clip which were all there the next day. Will never stay at a holiday inn again"
47,1511,"Feb 21 2004	Avoid if possible	We stayed one night at this hotel in February 2004. It's fairly close to the airport and offers reasonable prices + free parking. However, we would not return to this hotel: The room looked well past its prime and was simply not clean. Most pieces of furniture were scratched, a lightbulb in one of the lamps was completely missing and we found a silverfish in the bathroom. Roomservice delivered pancakes instead of the French Toast we had ordered. Very disappoiting."

50,1511,Aug 4 2008	bon rapport qualit prix
1,1514,Sep 6 2009 	Nice and Simple	I came to Montreal to visit with a few friends. Found this hotel near the Gray hound terminal. It's a nice hotel. The people were nice
2,1514,Aug 19 2009 	Critters	I referred my three friends to this hotel because it was close to one that I was staying in. It wasn't great
3,1514,Aug 11 2009 	Awful - sick from bed bugs	I just returned from this hotel and I am covered in bed bugs. I'm really hoping none came back with me - I got back at midnight. The infestation was so bad that these &quot;hard to spot&quot; fellows were not hard to spot but crawling all over the bed and sheets. I collected them and took some to reception. They pretended to be shocked but showed me a newspaper clipping in French about them that they conveniently had on hand for this new problem.On top of that I couldn't shower because the shower was broken in my room. So I had to go and give a paper at a conference covered in bites
4,1514,Jul 5 2009 	nice hotel  good service	The Hotel is at a very convenient location in Downtown Montreal. Our room was clean. The bed comfortable with nice clean sheets. There was a little problem with the air conditioner
5,1514,Jan 29 2009 	Terrible experience - beware of bed bugs	This hotel seemed innocent enough - an old gentleman behind the desk who was friendly
6,1514,Sep 20 2008 	Good for 1 night stay	I stayed at the Hotel 7 Sasions for one night only so this is only based on my 12 hrs stay.The hotel or rather I should say 'motel' is a little small victoria house. There are other hotels around the same block so I really had to paid attention to the signs.The entrance is on the first floor. It was only a Thursday night but was fully booked. A sign that says 'No Vancancy' was taped onto the door. The door was locked when I tried to open it. Then a man emerged from the inside and opened it for me. I told him a reservation has already been made early the week. So he let me in. The man turns out to be my 'check-in' guy. He told me there's internet access here on the 1st floor (which essentially was right beside the check-in counter) and there'll be continental breakfast at 7:30am. The breakfast was literally on the right side of the check-in area. Very small but cute. He handed me the key and I went up to my room.There wasn't much review about this hotel so I searched elsewhere on the website. Most of the other reviews rated this place 6.5/10. Everyone seems to disliked the smoke smell in their rooms. but they liked the decor though.The room was slightly smaller than what I had expected. But it got a bed and a washroom so it meets my requirement. My room did smell like 'Febreeze + cigarette smell. just like what the other posters had said. It has a TV and a mini fridge as well. My TV remote control was running out of battery so often times I couldn't switch channels (no bigging...). There were lots of pot lights and a cute chandiller hanging above my bed as well.As I was about to turn the lights off
7,1514,Aug 26 2008 	Très bon souvenir		
1,1519,"Nov 13 2009 	Very good modern hotel	Very comfortable rooms with not just free internet, but in room PCs. Included continental breakfast was a bonus. Good location close to Old Town and a choice of metro stations just a short walk away."
2,1519,"Nov 7 2009 	Basic hotel	This new hotel is clean and attractive. Staff is friendly. The rooms have large refrigerators and in-room computers (with French keyboards). The wireless internet worked well. The bed was comfortable. The hotel doesn't have many amenities besides a basic free breakfast and an adequate workout room. It's simple, but nice and comfortable.It is located only a half-block from the Palais de Congres convention center and the Place D'Armes Metro stop. It's only a few blocks from Vieux-Montreal (Old Town) and also close to the center of downtown. A great location is you want to see different parts of the city. I highly recommend the Hotel Le Dauphin!"
3,1519,"Nov 2 2009 	Great value!	My cousin &amp; I stayed here for a weekend getaway. I picked this hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor. Fantastic! The location was great being a block away from a metro stop and Old Montreal. In fact, Rue Ste. Catherine was only 2-3 blocks away as well. The room was spacious, clean, modern, and relatively new. The beds were firm &amp; comfortable. The bathroom was a little small but stylish with Grohe fixtures. Maybe it was a slow weekend, but the hotel was super quiet. I specifically asked for a quiet room, and boy, did I get one! The continental breakfast was okay; I opted for a banana and some tea. Because of the great value of the room, I indulged myself by going out for breakfast. Having an internet-connected computer in the room was wonderfully useful; hope this is a trend in other hotels! Overall, I was very happy with my stay and wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel!"
4,1519,"Oct 18 2009 	Great location clean modern hotel.	This hotel is in a fantastic location, right beside the congress centre, and in between old town and shopping on Ste. Catherine.The rooms were great - clean, modern, and the in room computer was a nice touch. Since there are only a small number of rooms on each floor, it was nice and quiet.We were a bit disappointed with the quality of the toiletries provided, I would have expected something a little higher-end to be more in line with the vibe of the hotel.The breakfast was good, however, be warned that they treat holidays like weekdays and not weekends, so we were a bit disappointed to have missed breakfast on the holiday Monday."
5,1519,"Oct 8 2009 	Absolutly Lovely.	very nice, clean hotel. great location, friendly staff. offered an umbrella when raining. gave resturant suggestions. breakfast was ok."
6,1519,"Sep 7 2009 	Clean and Modern	My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel in Montreal after much back and forth over where to stay. I ended up booking this hotel based on all of the positive reviews, but really had no idea what to expect upon arrival. It was a bit tricky to find, mostly because my gps was a little cranky and because it's a smaller hotel with an unassuming entry, but once we were inside, I was more than impressed. The decor was simple and modern, and everything looked brand new and clean. My favorite feature was the beautiful bathroom and the glass shower. I also was very impressed with the fact that we had a computer with free wireless, a fridge, a safe, and a huge flatscreen tv in the room. For what we paid, this was more than what we were expecting. We only made it to the continental breakfast one morning, but we were happy with it. There wasn't any coffee left, but upon letting the staff know, they made a fresh batch for us. The front desk staff was helpful and they all spoke English. Parking wasn't too much of an issue either. We bought pre-paid tickets from the hotel and were able to park in the convention center garage next door (which is a really great building as well!) We had no issues whatsoever. The location of the hotel was excellent as well. We were located right next to the subway system and a block or two away from Notre Dame and Old Montreal. It was the perfect spot.My one complaint is that housekeeping did come to our floor really early one morning, which I thought was weird. But I can't even be too sure of that because I was half asleep still. And a pool would have been nice, but at least there was air conditioning that cooled down the room very fast. If you are looking for a very reasonably priced hotel that is clean, comfortable, and has modern ammenities, then I would recommend this place in a heartbeat. If I return to Montreal, I would def. stay there again."
7,1519,"Aug 7 2009 	Montreawesome!C'est Parfait!	Stayed for 3 days with 2 teens. Hotel location was perfect. Room was big, 2 queens. Great breakfast. Staff was superb all around, friendly and helpful. Could walk to the old city sites several blocks to the south and to the city center for shops and restaurants several blocks north. Entrance a block away in convention center to Metro, walk thru underground city to McGill for college visit and then north through the Park to the Chateau for awesome view of the city. LONG walk uphill on rocky road, wear comfy shoes. We rented bikes from bixi stop outside the convention center a block away ($5 each) and biked down to the waterfront for a fab ride during a rainstorm. Ride to the end (opposite Molson) and get a lobster sandwich and clam chowder, then back on the bike. Fireworks Sat night- walk or cab ($10 from hotel) down Rene Levesque to the park and watch from the grass. Latin Quarter has lots of ethnic restaurants. Museaum w/history of city a MUST, teens loved it. $15/day park around corner in convention ctr. $`"
8,1519,"Aug 7 2009 	If you are looking for a great hotel in central MTL - STAY HERE!	So thanks to everyone's reviews and honest opinions on tripadvisor we were not disappointed when we booked this hotel for our 2 night stay this past weekend. We visit Montreal occasionally, more recently we have stayed at the Holiday Inn Express, and the Travelodge in Montreal. The holiday inn Express is always okay - but it was fully booked, so we tried something new and were pleasantly surprised with Hotel Dauphin. Great Location, close to shopping, chinatown, old montreal. Great Price..it was about $30 less than Holiday inn express. Included a really good self serve continental breakfast. Amazing Room - clean, very modern for a hotel, with free high speed access (unheard of!). Great service, the hotel front staff very helpful, pleasant. We were travelling within a group of 4 families, and all were very happy with the accomodations. No complaints! Yes, the parking is a block away but it is not really a big deal, just glad that our vehicles were safe! Some guest were having problems with their magnetic cards to access the elevator, but no biggie, I just needed to jiggle mine to work. I have to say it is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at within this price range, love the modern ammenities! Kudos to the staff &amp; management of this first class independant hotel. We will definately rebook on our next visit in October, and recommend to all:)"
9,1519,"Jul 9 2009 	Excellent location - excellent facilities	Only thing missing is a pool - but the rooms are great, and in a very central locale for all the events of Montreal. And great price compared to the over-priced places around it."
10,1519,"Jul 8 2009 	hidden gem nice modern decor great amenities	I picked this hotel for the location, and also for other amenities that come with it. This hotel is a no-fuzz hotel. The staff was always there but would not be in too much of your way -- perfect for quiet, no-fuzz travelers. The breakfast was very hearty with a great variety of different kinds of juices, drinks, toast, baked beans, etc. The most surprise of all was that the hotel provided a desktop computer in every room. If you bring your own laptop, you can unplug the Ethernet cable from the desktop and plug it into your own laptop. The room has in-room safe. The hotel looks new. Decoration is modern style with very clean room and bathroom, and a nice soft fluffy bed. I loved it and will stay there again if I have a chance."
11,1519,"Jun 28 2009 	Great value great location great place!	This hotel was renovated in 2007, location is great, 10 minute walk to Old Montreal.

Room was quiet, staff very pleasant and helpful, continental breakfast with juices, cereals, some fruit and bread, etc. Overall a great deal - would definitely stay here again in Montreal."
12,1519,"Jun 18 2009 	Good deal - nice place	This was just what I expected, pleasantly. A large, loft-like room, decorated in a very contemporary, soothing way, but not fancy. Essentially Hotel Ikea. Everything worked fine, the bathroom is huge, with a great shower, etc. If you're looking for top-tier materials and amenities and quality, pay more somewhere else. If you're looking for a very comfortable, workable, affordable place to stay very convenient to downtown and Old Montreal and not far from the Village, convenient to the Metro, stay at Hotel Dauphin. We got the most expensive room, which was on the top floor and had a separate sitting area with a leather sectional and extra TV, $169/night. The computer in the room was handy. The staff was friendly and helpful and efficient."
13,1519,"Jun 7 2009 	Oh La La...Tres Amazing!	Can't find a better deal in Montreal. Great location, great price. Nothing to complain about. I give it three thmbs up!"
14,1519,"Jun 2 2009 	I loved this hotel! Close to everything and was such a clean place w/ free Breakfast!	I stayed here for Memorial day weekend, and I fell in love. The Hotel was in a perfect location. I think the farthest thing we walked to was 15 minutes. We were three blocks away from the Notre Dame Basilica. The lightshow was really nice. Only $10 and it was worth it (though you have to sit through a little history lesson). The show its really amazing. From the Hotel old montreal is about 5 minutes walking distance. The Port is very lovely to walk up and down on. They have a new bike system where people can rent bikes I believe up to 24 hours. I must warn you that there is a deposit of $200, so if you plan on renting the bikes make sure you use your credit card and not your debit (needless to say we flipped out with we saw the charge). It takes from 24-48 hours for the pending charges to be removed once the bikes are returned to any station. I would def. rent the bikes again. It was a great time, i'll just make sure to use my Amex lol. Catherine street is about 3 blocks away, this is where you will find the shopping stores, Old Navy, Puma, foot locker. Crescent street is filled with bars and restaurants.The subway or metro was so easy to navigate, we had no problem getting to the Biodome on it (another place you should check out)The Hotel itself was very clean. The staff was always friendly and said hi. Check in and out were smooth, and our room was ready at like 12:30!! There is a free newspaper delivered every morning, and there is complimentary breakfast (cereal, toast, muffins, bagels, juice, tea and coffee) Its enough to keep you full until lunch.The Hotel has parking downstairs, but there were able 7 so depending on how many people are at the hotel with cars, you may be in luck, and it was only $15/dayThe beds were extremely comfortable. The showers were very clean and the tv was big. AND there is a computer in your room with FREE internet! There is also a fridge and safe. I felt right at home, and the next time I come to Montreal I will def. stay at this hotel. I feel like i'm leaving tons of things out. There was so much to do. We didn't have a set schedule of things to do, we just went with the flow. and it worked out perfectly. The people are very friendly and laid back.If you have any questions let me know!"
15,1519,"May 27 2009 	Excellent value + location	The suite was spacious and at the cost of a regular room anywhere in downtown Montreal. You get A LOT for your money ... a computer with internet, a jaccuzi, free breakfast, two televisions, spacious room, spacious shower, etc. A real bargain!"
16,1519,"May 24 2009 	Didnt like it at all - poor service	Didn't like it at all. Staying was terrible. Access is very bad they give you a scheme to get to their parking so you have to go all way around to get to it. No information on their website that parking is very limited (6 parking spots in underground garage! That's it!) and is 15$ per night. Room keys don't work you have to swipe it 3-4 times to get into your room or to start elevator (we saw all customers having same problems). Breakfast which was included in price was very cheap  no choice at all and same food every day. Stuff is very limited, nobody from management available on weekends and if you want to speak to manager ladies on reception say to wait till Monday!!! Stuff don't smile at all. Although hotel was empty we were given room with window facing back side with terrible view (no point to stay downtown!) and room was very small. They don't have pool in the hotel. I am completely unsatisfied and will never stay there again. NEVER"
17,1519,"May 20 2009 	Terrible time - our car got damaged in their garage! Don't stay there!	We were staying at Le Dauphin Centre Ville hotel with my family (my husband and his parents) for the weekend (we came from Toronto). They have a very small garage parking which is $15 per night. You have to get out of car to slide you room key to enter it, so my hubby did that door opened and when we start doing inside door hit our car! my husband had to make reverse to save car from bigger damage and door has broken deflector! We were so disappointed and upset, we wanted to see management right away but were told that nobody is available until Monday (and this happened on Saturday and were leaving next day). We called police and officer confirmed that door goes down too fast and motion sensor is installed to far inside in the garage. I spoke to their their manager Milot and he was mean to me Instead of reimbursing damage and apologies I heard &quot;call your insurance&quot;! And we are their customers whose weekend was totally spoiled!!! NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN. They don't value their customers and they have UNSAFETY parking garage! Don''t even want to think of what could happen if my husband didn't react so fast - we won;t be able to go back to Toronto next day... VERY UPSET"
18,1519,"May 18 2009 	Great hotel with lots of amenities in a good location reasonable price	Stayed here with some friends and shared a room with 2 double beds. The check in was quick and easy and we were given 4 room keys. The room was just as pictured and very clean. Great water pressure in the shower and the computer with internet in the room was a great feature. The room also has a mini fridge and in-room safe. The alarm clock has a docking station for an i-pod and when it goes off, it starts out quiet and works up to a louder volume and was pleasant to wake up to! The breakfast bar had more than enough selection. Location is close to everything we needed, particularly Old Montreal and Cirque du Soleil. We got parking but the small lot is very tight for a big car/SUV. We were allowed to keep our car in the lot for the remainder of our visit after we checked out for just $10, a great deal in the downtown for parking if you are going to walk around. This was a great hotel with lots of amenities in a good location with a very reasonable price for what you are getting."
19,1519,"Apr 13 2009 	Clean and pleasant boutique hotel close to the old city.	We (my husband and 10 and 12 year old children) stayed at the Hotel Dauphin for two nights over a very cold easter weekend. The hotel was very clean and the young women at the front desk were very helpful and kind. They all spoke both french and english. The room was somewhat small, but nicely and simply decorated. We had two king beds with soft linens, two chairs, and the TV and computer. The bathroom was very pretty but dark. There was no light in the shower stall. We were given keycards for security which allowed us to use the elevator, open the door, and turn on the lights. The breakfast was filled with mostly carb related foods - cereal, bread/bagel/homemade muffins - and some yogurt, beans, cheese, and apples. The location of the hotel was very convenient. We were in walking distance to the old city, where there were many restaurants, souvenier shops, and historic buildings. The very good science museum was close by. The metro was also very close. We were able to walk to other parts of the city as well. Overall, we had a very positive impression of this hotel."
20,1519,Feb 17 2009 	Great boutique hotel in downtown Montreal	Stayed at the Hotel Dauphin for 2 nights in October 08. The location was excellent - just a short walk from both Notre Dame and St Catherines.Hotel is very new and modern. Rooms were large and well-appointed. Nice TV and a computer with free internet in the room were highlights. Free Breakfast was excellent.Check in/out was quick - staff were very friendly and helpful (and bilingual).Highly recommend the Dauphin if you are looking for a great location between Old Montreal and St Catherines.
21,1519,"Jan 2 2009 	Great value for a hotel by conference center	We stayed here for a conference in September 2008. It was less than a block away from the conference center, so it was quite convenient in that respect. It was only a 20 minute walk away from the major shopping area. The hotel was always clean and quiet and the front desk staff was friendly. We forgot to bring an umbrella with us, but we were able to rent one from the front desk with a monetary deposit, which was returned when we returned the umbrella. Nice idea! There was complimentary internet and breakfast every day... the breakfast bar always included beans, which is apparently quite common in Quebec."
22,1519,Dec 22 2008	Quality Hotel 	A clean hotel at a reasonable price. Right off the main street so a good location but also very secure. With your curtains closed you are sure to forget that you are even in the middle of a city. Breakfast was minimal but otherwise a great place for the price.
23,1519,"Dec 14 2008 	There are better hotels in Montreal	This hotel is fairly new. If I return I will definetly find another hotel. The price however was not bad for what we received. At arrival no one helped us with our luggage, my mother had to push one of the carts to the front of the hotel to get our luggage from the car and than up the elevator to our third floor room. There were two staff members present, and not a lot of visitors in the lobby. Someone could have offered us some sort of help, we had just arrived from Quebec, and we had more than one suitcase. One benefit was the computer in the room this was a nice touch which I have never seen before. The t.v. was nice, and so was the modern feel of the room with a nice shower. It was clean, and the location was close to chinatown which is a nice place to visit and eat. The street this hotel is located on, is not great compared to other hotels close to more attractions. This hotel also does not have parking and our parking thing got messed up where we ended up paying more than we should have. The beds were hard, which some people I guess like, but way to hard for me. Close to Old Montreal, we were able to walk a few blocks and we were there. There was also a free breakfast which was conveniant. Our family first traveled to Quebec than Montreal, and this hotel does not compare to how nice our other hotel was. Just think in a few years, the computers and the tv will be outdated, and it may be hard to replace all of them, making this hotel older faster. Montreal is a nice city, and I think there are other better hotels out there. If your just traveling for business this is probably made better for that, than family traveling. the hotel also did not seem very busy in our stay, which I am not sure is a good/ bad thing. It was quiet which was nice."
24,1519,"Oct 12 2008 	Modern conveniently located hotel	We stayed at the Hotel Dauphin for 3 nights during September 2008. Location is great - near the convention centre and walking distance of the Old TownReception Staff: Pleasant, fluent in english &amp; french, which is very helpful. Room: Modern, clean and a decent size. The bed was king size and very comfortable with clean and soft sheets. Room had flat screen tv, free wireless internet (computer in the room!). Lovely modern double shower room (however a light in the shower area would have been even better). As an added bonus there was a continental breakfast included."
25,1519,"Sep 25 2008 	Liked the Hotel Dauphin	I stayed in the Hotel Dauphin for two nights during the first week of September 2008. Location is great - right near the convention centre and other hot spots in downtown Montreal. The hotel must have been really renovated recently. Everything seems new. Very modern, very clean. Room was huge, flat screen tv, free wireless internet, very nice bathroom. Bed was comfortable. No view out of my room, or any others as far as I could tell. No mini-bar. However, a very nice breakfast was included. I thought the price was excellent too.I recommend this hotel."
26,1519,"Aug 29 2008 	Great Spot for downtown shopping	Great little hotel....modern and very clean. 5 minutes away from shopping on St. Catherine's street. Free internet access in rooms was unexpected and welcomed. Free breakfast was very convenient (bagels, toast, juice, coffee, fruit etc). Overall a great spot if you're looking for something close to shopping and not too costly. Would definitely recommend it."
27,1519,"Aug 21 2008 	I will return	great hotel, not very busy brand new. it lacks certain amenities...but not necessary ones ( pool, restaurant), very limited but ok breakfast.PROS-fast windows vista dell pc in every room- under 5 mins to chinatownn- 10 mins to st. catherines shopping area- 5 mins to the startof old montreal- under 5 mins to Place D`armes metro station in the convention ctr.-27 inch flatscreen tv- big fridge- one of the nicest bathrooms, but no tub only shower-safe, acesscards neede for elevator-frequent cleaningCONS-limited light controls in room, all or non virtually- scan cards didnt work that well- short hotel, no views - beside a condemed haunted house, but still good area- no restaurant, only breakfats ( limited)I will return to this hotel, all I really care about is location and the state of the rooms, and for 4 people this hotel was great..pristine modern nice room and close 2 everything"
28,1519,"Aug 19 2008 	Great location great hotel	We returned on Aug. 16, 2008 from an 8-day stay at Hotel Le Dauphin on Rue de Bleury in downtown Montreal and I can't say enough about how it was a great choice. My mom (in her 60s), myself (in my mid-40s) and my two daughters (ages 10 and 12) all loved the hotel. I chose it specifically because it was the only hotel in Montreal I could find that offered 2 queen beds standard. I ended up booking it online (I think room was about $147 per night) as my travel agent couldn't find me anywhere that had anything but 2 double beds and we wanted to stay in 1 room! Not only was the room clean, new (I believe the hotel only opened in 2007. Everything seemed new), well decorated, with luxurious bedding and a beautiful bathroom, they also provide a computer with internet access in each room at no additional charge, as well as a flat screen cable TV with DVD player and a refrigerator (plus 2 bottles of water per day in your room free). They have breakfast everyday in a nice breakfast room from 6 to 10 am and it includes cereals, croissants, bagels, toast, fruit, beans, coffee, tea and juices. They offer some snacks (sodas, bottled water, candy) for sale in the lobby. There is also a washing machine and dryer behind a door in the lobby restroom (can only enter with your room keycard) in case you need that and laundry soap available for sale in the lobby too. The hotel staff are French-speaking but the staff in the reception area all speak fluent English too. It is also located in a great place. It is one block from Palais de Congres (Montreal Convention Center) which is across the street from a great fountain that was originally created for the Olympics and is covered in steamy smoke and a ring of fire each night (at least it was when we were there. Not sure if it is seasonal). We were also within 2 to 3 blocks of 3 subway stops on two different lines which made getting around on the metro (which is very clean and safe and easy to take -- even my mom went alone to the casino by subway and bus) very easy! The underground mall (including shops and cafes) at Desjardins on Boulevard Renee-Levesque is within 3 blocks and you can walk through it to get to Place D'Arts subway stop (we were directed by hotel staff). The main tourist sites of Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal) are also within easy walking distance of the hotel (about 4-8 blocks depending on where you are going) and if you go out the hotel door and turn right and right around the haunted house next door, you will see Chinatown within about 1 block! Though not much was mentioned about Chinatown in guidebooks, it has good Chinese restaurants and even bakeries. This hotel is ideal if you do not need a real concierge (all the staff at the reception desk are helpful and have maps and guidebooks but there is not a real concierge), and do not need a restaurant or pool right in the hotel. I may try to talk my husband into going back for our 15th anniversary this fall!"
29,1519,"Aug 3 2008 	Nice for the Price	We stayed at the Dauphin during the Jazz Festival. it's in a very convenient location, just a few blocks from the festival with China Town and Old Town also very close. The complimentary breakfast was fine, offering fruit, coffee, yogurt, pastries, and cold cereal. There is parking available at the nearby convention center for $17/day. The parking onsite was sold-out. The rooms were comfortable and clean with a mini-fridge, safe, and flat-screen TV. The bathroom had a nice walk-in shower. One complaint - the gym is a little creepy. It's in a windowless, interior room that's a little smaller than one of the guest rooms. Could be a little weird if there's more than one person in there at a time. Overall a nice place to stay with very reasonable rates. We'll probably consider staying here the next time we go to jazz fest."
30,1519,"Jul 10 2008	Poor Service	This is a smoke free hotel in the heart of the city. The rooms are a bit small but all right. But the service is very bad.. We checked into our room to find out it was very HOT. So called up the desk and they instead of fixing the A/C gave us another room. An overkill but we said all right and moved to the other room. Two lights weren't working which I could live with (as there were 6 lights in the room). But one of them was flickering and we wanted it changed. We stayed there for two days and they changed the light the next day. Another thing none in the front desk can suggest things to do in the city. They give u a brochure and ask u to figure it out.. Maybe the staff did not like to work on the first of July, but they should not have kept the hotel open then. Breakfast and ease of access to nearby point were the high points.. I would not stay here again."
31,1519,"Jul 4 2008 	Great Hotel	This a great hotel and great value. The rooms are spacious with superb amenities, i.e., a computer with free internet connection, a modern inroom safe, refrigerator, a beautifully furnished bathroom with state of the art shower fixtures, comfortable beds, etc. The exterior is very modest and initially a turn off because it is tangent to a closed out and what appears to have been an amusement haunted house, complete with ghouls hanging our of windows and intentional graffiti (I think) on the walls. It is located on a fairly calm street and consequently traffic noise is not a factor. We were on the fourth floor facing the street and we couldn't hear any traffic on weekends as well as weekdays.The location is terrific and negates having a car. About 7 easy minutes walk to Old town and a myraid of resturants and shops., 3 minute walk to Chinatown, 12 - 15 minute walk to the train station, and a 5 minute walk to a Metro station. The Chinatown had a some good resturants and a particularly neat bakery which offered these warm rolls with bacon and other stuff on it - they were delicious and cost about $1.25 each. Also try their custard tarts for a $1 each. The area immediately around the hotel felt very safe to me and we (my wife and I) often walked to and from at night without feeling threatened at any time.The staff of this hotel is warm and friendly. I felf genuinely welcomed. I would definitely come back if I ever visited Montreal again and would recommend this place to anyone."
32,1519,"Jun 15 2008 	veryvery nice!	I read some reviews on tripadvisor.com and we decided to choose this hotel. It was a wise decision: good location, very clean and recently renovated rooms,internet and PC in your room and very friendly staff. The breakfast was not something exceptional but we had Rue St Denis just 5 min walking so, a lot of places where we could have a very good french breakfast."
33,1519,"Nov 24 2007	Excellent downtown hotel with free computer and internet	Right in the middle of Montreal downtown, a few blocks away from the Old Town, Art center, conference center, and Chinatown. Very clean, nice interior design, inexpensive. Free computer and internet in every room! Okay free continental breakfast.The room is nice but not quite spacious, which I guess is okay for a downtown hotel.Parking is $17, but you can find cheaper parking closeby. Meters are very expensive, $3 an hour, but public parking is $10 a day."
34,1519,"Nov 8 2007 	Underrated	Decided to try out this somewhat unknown hotel and I was pleasantly surprised. It seems like it is pretty new as the rooms, decor, building are all in good shape.The area is right downtown and from the outside the hotel doesn't look like much. Its a smaller hotel with nine floors and about 10 rooms per floor maybe.The room was designed with a modern IKEA-like style. Not a big room, but well kept and well equipped. I was surprised to see they offered a new Dell Dimension PC, keyboard and LCD as part of the standard package, along with hi-speed internet. LCD TV, mini-fridge, safe, cordless phone, alarm clock were nice features. The bathroom was modern as well with Grohe hardware in the sink and shower, which was a funky glass enclosure.I must say the mattress and linens were just okay.. ive had softer more luxurious hotel beds for sure.The staff was friendly and flexible and let me have a 2pm checkout which was perfect to take a noon conference call from my room.Continental breakfast is also offered and parking is underground... but only 12 spots or so available.You had to use your passkey in the elevators, parking garage, etc. and I saw they had videocameras all around too for security reasons.I thought it was pretty good value for the location and would stay there again."
35,1519,"Oct 24 2007 	Wonderful! Don't be put off by gloomy reception.	Can't recommend this hotel highly enough, for the huge room and the facilities. Don't be put off by the gloomy reception area and rather neutral receptionists. This is a very new hotel, and the usual modern facilities (iron and board, hair dryer, kettle, coffee, tea) are exceeded by an in-room programmable safe, plasma TV and your own computer. This last was an absolute boon. Complimentary newspapers left outside your room, and self-serve breakfast in the breakfast room offers a wide choice of options. Exercise room equipped with three machines. Good location, between 2 Metro stations and in walking distance of Chinatown and central shopping district. I stayed in 5 hotels in Canada, and this was by far the most luxurious and the best."
36,1519,"Oct 12 2007 	Great Location Clean Modern Rooms Good Value	Le Dauphin is a clean, newer, modern hotel in a prime location. If you are having a convention, you couldn't pick a better place because it is just steps away from the Convention Center. My family and I walked to Vieux Port, Rue Ste.-Catherine, and Chinatown in minutes. The bed was soft with white linens, possibly it was a down comforter. There was a nice LCD television and small flat screen computer with internet access. The bathroom shower was chic with its stone tiling and glass wall. Having only stayed one night, I found it quiet for that night and did not have any loud neighbors. There was no swimming pool but our room had a view of the adjacent condo's rooftop pool. Too bad! Parking was a small journey since we had to park in the convention center garage, but it wasn't a big deal. The continental breakfast was really good, especially the muffins and bagels. Stay here for convenience, cleanliness, good value, and comfort."
37,1519,"Sep 17 2007 	Great amenities perfect for business travellers	I was pleasantly surprised to find such a great hotel. Done in a boutique-style they really go over the top to give you the little extras, especially for the price. I've never actually had a real hair dryer in a hotel room before! I stayed in the King suite and the leather lounging area was great for relaxing. The free internet in my room was a nice little addition as well. A bit more down-budget, the service isn't much, but the price is great. Staff, when needed, is terrific.Location isn't the greatest, but you're still within a 15 minute walk to the downtown core and Old Montreal. If you'll be at the Palais de Congres, however, it's a perfect location."
38,1519,"Jul 18 2007 	Excellent Location and Reasonable Price	We have stayed here for 3 nights and we love it!!!Pros: New and stylish hotel with excellent location, only 2 mins walkto the Metro station (Place des A'rmes), 5 mins walk to the Notre Dame, breakfast was complimentary and was served from 6am, free access to the laundry machines (you need to ask the front desk for the key to use the machines), computer with internet connection inside each guest room, flat screen TV, DVD player, super comfortablebeds, and friendly staff.Cons: breakfast could have been a little better, not enough bars/racks/hooks to hang the towels and clothes inside the bathroomThe pictures shown in their websites are exactly the same as they are."
39,1519,"May 7 2007 	What a surprise!	Was not sure whether or not to stay at the Hotel Dauphin as their website does not really promote a professional image of the hotel. However, I can say that this hotel was quite a great find!Rooms are very new and well equipped - comfortable king bed, large refrigerator, LCD TV, a computer (yes!) with free internet, and a nicely finished bathroom.View from the room was not great, actually the only thing I could see was the wall of another building, and breakfast which is included in the rate is quite basic. However, the location and quality of the hotel are fantastic for the price. Would recommend."

3,1522,Aug 24 2006 	Barely adequate.	I chose this place for a one night stay for my wife and I during our July 2005 vacation to Canada because of its location and price. The place appeared to be in the middle of renovation. Or rather
4,1522,Aug 22 2006 	travel alert	This is the sleaziest hotel I've ever stayed in. Bedbugs...broken window latch...I can vouch that these are all true. For your own safety and peace of mind

8,1522,Mar 14 2006	It's a bit out of town	The location of this hotel was a bit far out of the city for my liking. Although only a 20 minute walk or three metro stops
9,1522,Feb 14 2006	Very Friendly	We spent two days in Montreal during our honeymoon.Since we hadn't booked any hotels we chose this hotel by tripadvisor because of its review.We have been very well. We couldn't stay there one day more because there wasn't rooms available but fortunately we met Sam (reception). He was so kind to help us to find an other hotel.This hotel could be compared with two/three stars european hotel.R&amp;G Italy

12,1522,Nov 18 2005	Incredibly Convenient Location 	The best part of the hotel was not only the friendly service (especially Sam!) but the location. We flew into the Dorval airport
13,1522,Nov 13 2005	Great value and location	We would definitely stay in this hotel again. The room was very clean though small. The location was great. Parking not a problem we got a spot on the street right in front of the hotels entrance. Good free coffee and croisants in the morning. The only complaint was towels the size of washcloths
14,1522,Nov 8 2005	Can't Beat Price 	A group of us stayed here over the weekend and got a great deal. In addition to it's very reasonable rates
15,1522,Oct 21 2005	Great hotel for a great price	We were only going for a weekend and we just found this hotel on expedia. We checked the ratings and decided to give it a shot. Who would've thought that the hotel would turn out this great. We were so impressed. The staff there was very friendly

20,1522,Sep 9 2005	Hotel de L'Elysee is the best deal in town!	My girlfriend and I spent a lovely 4 days in Montreal over the Labor Day weekend. We chose Hotel de L'Elysee due to its previous reviews on TripAdvisor.com and its wonderful location. The hotel was fantastic! The rooms were VERY clean and the staff was really helpful and friendly! The desk manager went out of his way to find restaurants and parking for us! He also gave us great suggestions as where to eat and places to visit in his city. I would highly suggest staying at Hotel de L'Elysee if you choose to visit Montreal. It is located in the heart of the Latin Quarter and only two blocks from St. Denis
21,1522,Sep 2 2005	Great Place to stay	My Husband and I recently spent 4 days at the Hotel De L Elysee in Montreal
22,1522,Aug 29 2005	Very Clean Great Staff Ext. Accomodating	I was not expecting much because the price was so inexpensive
23,1522,Aug 29 2005	I am coming back here.	Everything good about this hotel has already been said. I was looking for a central place to stay... so I could explore Montreal easily. The price we got for the hotel was much less than I had anticipated it would be... so I was prepared for less than the best... but I got more than I asked for.The room was immaculately clean. I have stayed in placed 4X as expensive without the rooms being as clean. The room we had was not very large. But why are you going to Montreal anyway
24,1522,Jul 14 2005	nice 	Clean room. Reasonable price. The Italian staff was extremely nice &amp; easy to communiicate
25,1522,Jul 11 2005	Rude staff and extra charges appearing on my credit card	I was giving a price on a phone discussion for staying at this hotel.When I arrived there I paid the amount we agreed on but I was told I've made &quot;a good deal&quot; because am getting a &quot;different&quot; room. At the check out the service guy (Eddy) asked me for an extra charge motivated by the &quot;extra-quality&quot; of the room I was given.Having no consent from my side the final invoice remained with the initial amount.When I got home and checked my account I was astonished to see they charged the amount they wanted on my credit card without my authorization.	
26,1522,May 24 2005	This place is awful	We made a reservation one evening and called the next day to change it from 3 to 2 days. They told us we could not do that because it was Memorial Day weekend
27,1522,May 24 2005	Great value and location	My friend and I stayed at Hotel de L'Elysee in the Latin Quarter district for 5 days from May 18-22 and had a large room that was clean and had a nice bathroom that had been recently renovated. The location was great as this brown stone hotel was half a block away from the Berri UQAM metro station and the bus station. In addition

1,1523,"Nov 3 2009 	Fantastic!!!	We enjoyed this hotel so much, I included it in my Blog encouraging readders to try it out;Great value plus plus. We had a family get together."
2,1523,"Mar 31 2009 	Quirky Montreal hotel	Perhaps not the obvious choice for a Montreal hotel but it actually proved a perfect base for a brief stay in the city. It doesn't look like a hotel from the outside (though the guide book which called it the ugliest building in town was way off the mark). In fact it looks like a trendy office block on the outside, and its reception/foyer area wouldn't be out of place in a trendy ad agency. The (few) staff are incrediby young and incredibly attentive, preumably most are students at the Institute. The room was well equipped and all have small balconies with good views over the city. The bathrooms are admittedly quite small but perfectly adequate. A good buffet breakfast including waitress-delivered hot food was included. Although not downtown it's located in one of the tendiest areas of the city close to countless great bars and restaurants."
3,1523,"Oct 31 2008 	Good location and good restaurant	We were on a road trip through Quebec and were recommended this hotel on short notice. You can walk into town in about 15+ minutes. Subway nearby. The rooms are modern with secure locks and balconies, some with fair views. The hallways are wide enough you could drive a car down them. There is active securtiy personnel monitoring a very long lobby that connects the hotel to a restaurant on the ground floor. You can park your car in a garage with an automatic door that has elevator access to your rooms floor - it was not cheap; parking cost about $20/day but I thought worth it for our peace of mind the first time in this city. The beds were comfortable and the bath roomy, clean and modern. We were very happy with this choice.The hotel is a school and run by students and I think they do a very good job. The attached restaurant is also a school and that was the most pleasant surprise. They have a daily menu for dinner that was (for us) a six course meal for what we considered an absolute bargain. Even if you don't stay here, you should check out the restaurant. The atmosphere is a bit cool, almost as if you're in a cafeteria or conference center, but the food and service are excellent. It;s in a mixed use neighborhood with shops, office buildings, apartment buildings and restaurants; a little gritty in some corners but overall quite acceptable. We walked downtown to see some of the artists during the Jazz Festival, but there is a subway stop right nearby as well so you can around the whole city easily. We found this to be an excellent overall value, in a good location and one of the highlights of our trip. We would recommend it highly to anyone."
4,1523,"Jan 14 2008 	Adequate Accommodations but lacking in customer service...	This is a reasonably-priced, comfortable hotel that is very conveniently located near Sherbrooke metro station.The room (one queen bed with private bath and a small balcony) was clean. However, if you stay here, be warned that there is next to no customer service. When I called the reception to ask for extra towels, I was told &quot;you were supposed to have them in the room, no?&quot; I was not even transferred to housekeeping and the reception attendant rudely hung up the phone. In the end, I had to call housekeeping myself.Also, if you stay here, I would advise skipping the breakfast. I waited for an hour for food only to be told that because of some kind of 'problem' in the kitchen they were unable to make a crepe. At this point, I was so frustrated I cancelled the order, only to be given no apology or compensation."
5,1523,Oct 16 2007	Wholly inadequate conduct	Unfortunately we never got the chance to see the rooms of this hotel due to their clear mistake taking our reservation. I was initially impressed by there quick response to E-mails but on our arrival found they had made a reservation for September rather than October. Having travelled up from Toronto with visiting friends and children we were then told there were no rooms available and recommended a &quot;similar hotel' just down the road. This turned out to be no more than a hostel and clearly not equivalent. I did receive an E-mail apology on my return home and the offer of a 40% discounted room rate to be used before the end of the year......a response I felt was quite inadequate for our inconvenience. A disheartening experience to start our Montreal trip saved by the Marriot and some nice French wine!Duncan Hogg
6,1523,Jul 23 2007 	Very nice stay in the Institute	Just two blocks off of the Quartier Latin located it is very close to the action yet far enough to get a good nights sleep. I loved the modern interior. The very clean room was in the top floor facing north. Very good 2 queen size beds. The breakfeast in the morning was great and included. Parking is pretty steep ($18 per day) plus the $150 for the double bed 1 room is also not the cheapest. The staff was very helpful and friendly.
7,1523,"Oct 3 2005	Great place great location	Stayed here for 3 nights in mid-September. It's staffed by students, with some professional (non-student) staff as well. Great service, everyone very helpful and pleasant. Good room, great bed (but very hard pillows!). The rooms have small balconies; ours had a view of Mont Royal itself. I think some rooms are handicapped-accessible. Parking is available for $15CD/day, charged to your room; breakfast is included in the restaurant downstairs. Very slow breakfast service! That's my only complaint. Husband loved it. Great location, close to everything, a subway stop right behind the hotel. Give it a try."
8,1523,"Aug 25 2005	The Only Room in Town Turned Out to Be Just Fine	My husband and I rarely book hotels in advance when we travel because we like to keep a loose itinerary. We do, though, make up a list of about 10 local hotels in priority order and call them one by one when we arrive in town. This plan has never backfired on us EXCEPT when we stayed in Montreal. We had the unfortunate timing of arriving during Pierre Trudeau's funeral, which was being held there, and everything was sold out that we tried. Desperate, I asked for a recommendation from the last place I called about who might have a room left. I was advised to call Hotel de L'Institut. Between its &quot;last to be picked for the team&quot; status and its role in training hospitality students, you can imagine that my expectations were low when we arrived at the hotel.Turns out it was a perfectly pleasant experience. The room was clean, nicely appointed and sunny. The hotel is elegant, the service was good and we didn't even get gouged for our dilemna (about $95 per night, if memory serves). I would stay there again - even if there are other rooms available next time!"
9,1523,"Feb 16 2004	Great place; great location	My wife and I have gone to l'Institut for many years (before recent remodeling). A very, very decent hotel and manageable proportions...really excellent sit-down breakfast...and a great location in the French district with lots of young, vibrant, people about. Very close to METRO and all the transit links. We'll go again."
10,1523,Feb 26 2008 	Quelle salle de bain!
1,1524,"Great hotel; Phenomenal staff	Good accommodations in an excellent location for a reasonable price. Comfortable, spacious rooms were exactly the home base we needed to explore the city and nightlife. Breakfast included from the Bistro was a nice plus. When our car got broken into (recommend paying a little extra to park in the hotel's garage instead of street parking) the hotel staff could not have been more helpful. Paul came to the rescue of these three American travelers and helped us deal with the difficult situation from every angle -- always exceedingly gracious. Recommend Hotel De Paris to any travelers visiting Montreal. We'll definitely stay here the next time we visit!"
2,1524,"Oct 13 2009 	Terrible place	The room was very dirty. There was dust on the window sill, fan and bedside table. There was also a large spider web in one corner with a large spider crawling on it. There were several walls that had holes in them, and finally there was no TV or phone."
3,1524,"Aug 26 2009 	Over-priced and dirty	Like others, I was pleased with the exterior and location of the Hotel de Paris, but very dissapointed with the room itself. It was cramped, and dirty (we actually had a plane of sheet glass sitting behind one of the curtains in our room, leaning against the TV cabinet). We cycled into Montreal, and stayed here based on the fact that it had the Route Verte certification, but were very dissapointed with the bicycle parking amenities (we were told to bring our tandem bike up two flights of stairs to place in our room)."
4,1524,"Aug 22 2009 	Good location but disappointing overall and definitely over-priced	First thing I should mention is that we stayed in the annex across across the road from the main hotel.&quot;Run down&quot; would be the expression that would most accurately describe the place. Either that or &quot;done on the cheap&quot;. The towels were thin and small, and they were replaced on a seemingly random basis. The building itself could have been doing with a lick of paint, and the exterior garden was overgrown and shabby. Little things that are easly fixed but make a big impression - clearly the owners do not see this as a priority.For example, the cleanliness left a lot to be desired (dusty shelf, floor could have been swept with a bit more effort) and the shower cubicle was tiny (was really hard to move around in - let's just say if you were even slightly obese you would have a job even getting into it!). There was a stained old rug on the floor which I made a point of avoiding when walking barefoot! The window shutters were cumbersome, and the AC unit was completely and utterly useless - it clearly hadn't been cleaned in eons, and therefore served no purpose other than to sound like a jumbo jet taking off.Breakfast isn't worth mentioning - go to Cora's and enjoy a proper meal!PLUS: Good location.MINUS: No working AC facility despite being listed as such."
5,1524,May 31 2009 	Nice place near McGill	I enjoyed this small hotel which is in a very good location.I was able to walk everywhere I wanted togo. I took the suite. It had a balcony overlooking the old city. My twin daughters who will attend McGill next year stayed in a budget room. The staff were helpful and prices were very reasonable for downtown.
6,1524,"May 19 2009 	Great little boutique type hotel	We stayed at Hotel de Paris on the long May weekend. We had a very cute room on the second floor of the hotel with a queen bed at a very reasonable price. The room was spotless and the staff friendly. It is a smaller hotel, not a chain and that's what I liked about it, it has tons of character and is just a pleasant relaxing place to be. Great location near a ton of restaurants and the metro. Highly recommended."
7,1524,"May 19 2009 	Things NOT to do in Montreal: 1. stay at Hotel de Paris	When arriving and looking at the Hotel, you might think that it looks like a nice little Hotel to stay in while in Montreal. When leaving, you will think ... never again.Ok, first up, the setting. We were a small group, in the age group of 28 to 60, and well, slightly over the age of finding it exciting to backpack and stay in dilapidated hostels, because that's exactly what this is, just for a higher price. And also, I can see that they apparently have a youth hostel part aswell, but we stayed in what is referred to as the &quot;hotel&quot; part of Hotel de Paris. So this review does not concern the &quot;hostel/auberge de jeunesse&quot;.We paid up-front for two days, I guess the alarm bells should have been ringing already there, as when do you ever pay the stay up-front, other than in a place where they are used to having people run from the bill.Anyway, once in the entrance, you start getting the feel of the place. The entrance was being renovated so it was dirty, had a makeshift congierge desk and didn't look very inviting. The receptionist was reasonably friendly but overall seemed rather uninterrested.We then got to our rooms: small was the first impression, the bed was just hard and small and short, there was a linen and another sheet to keep us warm (thank god we did not come in the winter!), furniture was generally just old and in places falling to pieces. Tiny television from the early 90's, tiny bathroom, again everything just kind of seemed like it was falling apart. The walls had been partly painted in places and still looked like a work in progress, the curtains were kept on the window with some home-made fittings. It was just not very inviting, and when you look around you start thinking that you will do your best to spend as little time as possible in the room.Then, closer look, dirt on the window sill, dirt in every corner, dust, chewing gum under the desk etc. Basically, once you finally arrive home, the first thing you do is to put all clothes and material that has been in contact with the room into the washer.The atmosphere, well, mainly young people were staying in the hotel. This just meant that it was loud, people running around the corridors screaming, and it also smellt of marijuana for a large part of a rainy saturday. The walls are paper thin as well, so we had to listen to our neighbours have sex,... several times, which again just added to an already unpleasant experience. The only reason we actually stayed the two nights was part laziness and part the fact that we were not planning to be in the Hotel except for a quick sleep. And to be honest, when you are in a hotel like this, sleep is not exaclty what you feel like either.Now some might think, well, this sounds like the place to stay for backpackers, and again, I would have to say no, as this place costs $100 CAD per person per night. An incredible price for such a place. Had this place cost under $100 CAD per ROOM per night, I might have been able to accept the quality, but for that price I expected so much more.And then of course breakfast is included... on their website, which by the way looks very nice (http://www.hotel-montreal.com/) they state that the &quot;continental breakfast&quot; is included. Their continental breakfast is 1 coffee/tea, 1 croissant, 1 orange juice. Don't expect jams or chocolate spread or any ham or cheese etc. Fair dues, the croissant was good, it was still an overall dissappointing experience. The bistro is, as also the hotel, quite dilapidated.Any positives? Yes the location isn't half bad. 10 - 20 minute walking distance to downtown depending on your speed.So overall, this place just seems to be run by people who have no particular interest to be in the hotelling business, or potentially they just don't have a clue. It looks like a place that's there to take whatever money it can get without paying any particular attention to making the customer happy or having return business, because I cannot see how anyone would want to return quite frankly. One thing is to have an old mansion at your disposal, but then making this out of it? Clueless. And if you want to get anywhere in the business, the least you can do is keep the rooms clean. To be honest, looking at the house, there is potential, it just needs someone who cares and who knows a thing of two about renovation, because whatever is in there, should just be torn down to start anew."
8,1524,"May 19 2009	Clean and affordable	This hotel was great, many many many stairs! Clean rooms, we stayed in a budget two star and it was small, however the bathroom was completely new, and the sheets were clean. front desk is very kind and helpful. Excellent location if you want to walk to the village or latin quarter. And Rue st catherine is about a 10 dollar cab ride. Breakfast was modest, but just enough to get you started in the morning choice of fresh muffin or croissent with tea/coffee and a small cup of juice. Could not ask for more at 89 dollars a night. Honestly if your going to drink or shop and dont plan on using your room for anything other than a place to sleep. Hotel de Paris is a great bang for your buck!"
9,1524,May 11 2009 	It is a great pace to stay	I came with 2 other friends on a cross-country trip and they set us up in the Hostel area. The staff were really nice and were able to give us great advice on activities. We also made friends with another group of young people in the lounge and ended up going on excursions togetherwe had a blast!
10,1524,"May 10 2009 	Cute little hotel	I enjoyed my stay at Hotel de Paris. I was on business in Montreal and loved the location close enough to walk to all my meetings downtown and some great restaurants. The room was clean, quiet, comfortable and had free WIFI and a small desk to complete all my work. The hotel has character and friendly staff. Definitely a more enjoyable experience than another Holiday Inn. I would definitely go back especially for the price."
11,1524,"Apr 13 2009 	Good Solid Accomadations.	I stayed at the hotel for the Easter long weekend. The location was excellent and the room was on the 3rd floor. It was clean, cozy and quiet. Very nice accomadations especially for a standard room. The manager at the front desk was extremely helpful and gave me great directions to get around the city. Great experince at a very affordable price."
12,1524,"Mar 26 2009 	Worst Hotel Experience of All Time	Awful experience at Hotel de Paris, Montreal. Hotel is divided between two buildings on either side of Sherbrooke Street. This is quite inconvenient as I will explain. Please read my review of this horrible place.The towels were frayed, thin, small. The bed sheets were thread-bare and see-through. No extra blankets. No shampoo or conditioner, lotion as is customary at most hotels. No clock, tv was very small, shower curtain was too small for the shower opening, water all over because of this. Shower curtain rod was a tension rod that slipped down the shower walls and fell down with every shower taken.Bed was old, creeky, extremely poor quality mattress. Lamp and room lighting was poor. Large wooden window shutters instead of curtains or blinds were difficult and cumbersome and allowed in full view from the street or zero. Room did not have a coffee machine and breakfast voucher from cafe was a rip. If you want to take your bagel and coffee from the cafe to go you are forced to pay extra to do so for each breakfast. When questioned why, they were hard pressed to provide an answer.The room was not supplied with kleenex tissues and had only one roll of toilet paper. I had to cross the street and ask for another.The closet and room in general was small. Bathroom was miniscule.It looks like they tried to spend money on the finishes. The washroom had nice tiles and the shower looked nice. However, the taps made this extremely high pitched, loud sound when the shower was running. It sounded like a fire alarm going off and nothing we adjusted could make the sound dissipate. They should have spent the money on details like this instead of pretty tiles.I woke up to the smell of cigarette smoke on Saturday morning. When I spoke to the front desk about it they said that no one was smoking in the rooms. I'm not sure how they could know that for sure from across the street. No one offered to look into it or follow up with me. Customer service lacking.I can't think of one thing that was positive about this experience. All around, it was the WORST HOTEL I have ever stayed at. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. Go elsewhere and be glad you did."
13,1524,"Mar 22 2009 	great value great place for young people	Enjoyed my stay here. I took a budget room for 74 canadian dollars with my girlfriend. It was small but clean. This turned out to be $53.00 US, a great deal for downtown montreal. There is also a youth hostel attached to the hotel, so we could use the kitchen and common room facilities and met a lot of nice people. On our way out the cleaning girl was cleaning one of the deluxe rooms. It was awesome, like a 5 star hotel, huge beautiful room with balcony overlooking the whole city. Did i mention the building? Its special. Look at the photos on the site."
14,1524,"Mar 16 2009 	very good small hotel	I had been staying in Old Montreal at the Nineteenth Century hotel for a few days. Changed to Hotel de Paris downtown in the plateau, better price and better location. This is another beautiful building. The lobby was under renovation but my room (I asked for a luxury room) was great. It was huge and had a large balcony overlooking the city. There is a youth hostel attached to the hotel and it was a nice place to meet some young people. Ann Munster"
15,1524,"Jan 13 2009 	One of the Worst Experiences	This hotel was one of the worst in my experience. Don't stay there ifyou are over 25. It is noisy inside and out, and the room was tiny and dirty. Don't be fooled by the romantic sounding name either...there's Nothing charming about this dilapidated old building."
16,1524,"Jan 7 2009 	not good hotel it is a hostal.. for backpacker	The hotel is not really a hotel, it is a house refurnished to be a hotel, old very old beds, tv, etc, no shampo, small towels, breakfast offered is : bagel+coffe+ orange juice sample.They have no clean up the room in the hotel, neither trash pick up nor bed cleaning.For the price we paid + 15 CAD per night, we can stay at Queen Elizabeth Fairmonts hotel, so watch outThere is &quot;free wireless&quot; internet and local calls free.No parking at all, closest is a Double Tree parking lot about two blocks.If you are backpacker it is ok, but for same amount of money you mabe can get a better and real hotel.No lugage help, front desk people in morning has very bad attitude, by the way we are paying..., to guest."
17,1524,"Dec 10 2008 	Perfect spot when I am in downtown Montreal	I find myself in Montreal on business and pleasure a few times a year. I had stayed at this Hotel a few years back, and had really enjoyed it. I decided on my latest trip, to stay there again, as it is perfectly located for me to be able to walk to my meetings, and then to be near the part of town I enjoy most at night (the St. Denis area). The hotel has a very personal feel, the staff are friendly and helpful. The building is architecturally beautiful, with the unique look you see in Montreal, and also with its castle like turrets. In fact I stayed in one of the &quot;turret&quot; rooms, which was large and comfortable. The room, and the bathroom were large, clean, and up to date, Check in and out is simple and easy, with a personal touch. Unlike the large sterile McHotels that are in downtown Montreal this one has a unique charm."
18,1524,"Aug 30 2008 	Maybe Good for the Young	I last stayed at Hotel de Paris in Montreal in early 2001. I found it agreeable for the price plus it was safe, clean and had a helpful staff. I found all of the above still true on this trip. But...things were also different this time around. In the seven years since my last stay the price has more than doubled. The sinking US dollar has made everything more expensive but I could see no real justification for the current cost per night. The hotel itself is a bit long in the tooth and in serious need of renovation. I think an elevator would be a nice touch. Last time I stayed in a street level room, this time on the third floor. Theres a hike of about 50 steps to get from the street to the main lobby. I now have bad knees and the going up to the lobby then three more flights of steps was an arduous task for me. I saw other middle-aged customers struggling in the same way that I was. My room last time was rather small but this time my room and bathroom on the third floor were really tiny. You could not open the door alll the way to the room without hitting the bed. I could barely squeeze into the shower, the opening was 22&quot;'. The wi-fi was spotty at best and 13&quot; TV was marginal at best. The free breakfeast consist of toast and bad coffee. There is no ice or soda machine. There are good things though. It is just a few blocks from the Metro, which I found to be very convienent and in a nice neighborhood. Though tiny; my room was clean and as before the staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel is attached with a youth hostel across the way and that seems to be the mindset of the owners. When I was their ages I didn't mind going up hundreds of steps to get anywhere but now that I'm on the shady side of middle-age, it is a consideration.But all in all I think I could have done better for the price."
19,1524,"Aug 20 2008	Terrible	I work for Smarter Travel which is under the Expedia umbrella. so we received a certificate that we had to use on Expedia. we usually stay at Bed&amp; Breakfast spots when we go to Montreal but we couldn't find one on Expedia so we went with a hotel. My stepmom and my my father live in Montreal so we usually have them go and check out the spots after we book them and they told us that the bathroom was beautiful and that the hotel was in a decent area except if you go down one side street it gets shady. but overall she said the room that they showed here was pretty nice.WRONG! it was tiny. I mean you open the door an dthe bed is right there to your left. not even an inch away from the door. there was one chaie and one huge window facing another building. the bathroom was small, that you couldn't take s hower without your elbow touching the shower wall. The temperature of the water would just change on it's own. It was a nice looking bathroom, which is deceiving, until you get in and realize how tiny it reallly is. If you suffer from clostophobia DO NOT stay at Hotel de Paris."
20,1524,"Jul 31 2008 	Theft of items at Hotel de Paris	Our room was entered while we were away during the day and an assortment of items were stolen. We reported this to the hotel management, submitted a very legitimate claim for $480. and then was &quot;stonewalled&quot; by the owner and manager for a few weeks. Promises were made and not kept. After constant contact with them, they sent a check for $350. They never reported this to the police. Garage for car is a joke at $8.00 per night. Breakfast was a shoddy excuse."
21,1524,"Jul 13 2008 	good times	We liked this hotel. We are a group of students from Vermont and din't want to stay at a Holiday Inn. Very nice building at least 100 years old. Rooms were large, although they told us they had small budget rooms too. All in all a very good location, quiet but close to all the restaurants and nightlife downtown. Helpful front sesk sent us to Prince Arthur Street for supper and took time ro explain how to get around."
22,1524,"Jul 12 2008 	very good boutique hotel	I really enjoyed this hotel, right near St. Denis and Park Lafonataine. Had a fine time sitting on the balcony and looking down to the river. Freindly staff. Will come again."
23,1524,"Jul 2 2008 	I would say find a better one...	First of all, I didn't see anywhere that says this is a HOSTEL. If it does say then I take the blame for it. Here is the story:We arrived at the &quot;Hotel&quot; and the lady was nice did the stuff and said see that house across the street, you stay there. I'm thinking, this is the hotel we booked, this is the hotel we saw on the pictures and that's the reason why we booked this hotel just so we can go accross the street in another house. Whatever.We went there and the entrance looks like no one ever lived there. Grass and weed is growing everywhere. The room at first glance looks excellent but then you notice the walls are cracked, the windows are falling apart and then we turned on the window A/C which is probably from 1970. Very loud and no cooling.Ok, we said, we can go with this for $130.00 a night we expected anything.The parking was on the street and my feeling was pretty much if you get it you get it, if you don't get a ticket good for you.No bed bugs and decently clean, no complaints here.Next morning we go for breakfast in the terrace. The buffet will almost collapse from it's age but hey it's an old building.The breakfast includes ONE croissant, coffee and fake orange juice in a glass that is half the size of a coffee cup. and the guy serving you is &quot;very&quot; busy and let's you know that because he had 2 other people to serve and bring 2 croissants.I get mixed feeling about this place. If you are level set that this is hostel and that you will pay some good money for just below average place then you might be happy.Otherwise, I would recommend to go with other place where things are for certain.note:It does look to me like some of the reviews are overblown."
24,1524,"Jun 28 2008 	escellente lugar	I like dis hotel. Lovely to walk near here. Nice vista from balcony en frente. Workers almost all know to speak spanich. Freidly lugar. Linda edifidio...Yessee, Costa Rica"
25,1524,Jun 25 2008	Stay Away --- Stay Away --- Don't Do It	Well let's just say we paid for a room and never slept --- we were given a key to room 46 - that is the size of a closet door that lead up to a attic that had two double size matress laying on a floor in each side of the room and had two double size beds that were in the middle of the room - toilet seat falling off - no soap to watch your hands and none of the lamps work -- as I can see they don't send anyone up to the attic to clean --- if there was a fire our whole family would be dead - as this is a very scary and awful room to be put in without any source of escaping - We called numberous of time to find out if our parking stale was reserved and told yes twice to find out that one of the parking stale the worker at the time had no idea ---- If anyone stayed here recently obiviously didn't have the luck we had. For anyone going to stay good luck hopefully you will have better luck. This is a three star room rated by the hotel
26,1524,Jun 7 2008 	Very Nice	This hotel was nice.A 10 minute walk from the bus station and St Dennis shopping area.The room was large and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful.Breakfast was included in the little cafe bext door... basic but nice.
27,1524,"May 27 2008 	Very good all purpose hotel Spectacular building	this hotel seems to be constantly trying to get better. Everytime I have stayed here there was someting new. This time, breakfast is included in the price and is served in a really nice little Bistro downstairs, run by a funny Frenchman from, of course, Paris. There are a few types of room from budget to superior. I like the superior rooms in the Annex across the street. They are large and comfotable. We couldn't connect to the wifi which works haphzardly in our building but had free internet access to the wired terminal in the lobby.. I don&quot;t even consider going elsewhere, the staff seems genuinely happy to converse and is friendly and helpful. They also remember me. I like that."
28,1524,"Apr 21 2008	Great hotel downtown	We loved our stay at Hotel de Paris. The staff is friendly and helpful, rooms are nice and clean, and the location is a few steps away from St-Denis street. Excellent!"
29,1524,"Oct 31 2007 	So nice!	This hotel was very wonderful. The workers there were very pleasant. The hotel was very clean, the rooms were large and the price was not expensive. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
30,1524,Mar 9 2007 	Great location beautiful building	This is a terrific little hotel with friendly staff and if you like heritage buildings this is one lovely Victorian. I stayed in a deluxe room with my boyfriend for 2 nights. We had a balcony and great view of downtown. Dino at the front desk helped us find all the great night spots in town. I will come back here.Julia Grenouille
31,1524,"Jan 9 2007 	Good budget hotel	We stayed here for 2 nights right before New Year's and we will definitely stay here again when we are in Montreal the next time. Definitely a good budget location for backpackers or. The location is great and there are a bunch or restaurants and pubs withing a walking distance. The room was a good size, beds were comfortable enough and the staff was very helpful. The bathroom was fairly small, but I have to say that it was clean. The same cannot be said about the carpets in the room, especially under the beds, as it looks like it has not been vacuumed for weeks. The parking situation was decent, as there were parking places on both sides of Sherbrooke as well as on Saint-Andre, next to the hotel."
32,1524,"Jan 2 2007	NASTY!! Avoid the nightmare!!!	My experience with Hotel De Paris was so bad that I went out of my way to create a tripadvisor account and write this review! I also want to agree with another comment regarding the assumption that the good reviews were written by the hotel staff/owner. If you look at their accounts, you will see that those accounts were used only once to write those reviews. I found this hotel on hotwire.com. Since I usually have good luck with hotwire, I booked Hotel De Paris for 3 nights over New Years weekend. The hotel was rated 3 stars (comparable to a Doubletree), so I paid $100 a night. Hotel De Paris is the worst hotel I ever stayed at!!! The hotel is really dirty and smells. The room was tiny. The carpet was dirty and didnt look like it was vacuumed for a very long time. The sheets and comforter were disgusting and didnt look like theyve been washed. The walls were extremely thin (you can hear everything). The bathroom had stains and was gross. The hotel should be rated 1 star or a low scale hostel. I tried to upgrade/switch room, but the other rooms were worse. FYI, I checked out their web site and the rooms are nowhere close to the pictures. Also, I woke up after the third night (this morning) with bed bug bites on my arms and legs. I have already written an email to hotwire telling them that I will never use their service again. Please do yourself a favor and never stay at this hotel! Our friends got into the Hyatt (priceline) for the same price we paid!"
33,1524,Oct 14 2006	great location	I had a real good timein this hotel. Was easy to walk all over and the receptionist spoke perfect spanish an helped me a lot. The room was nice and breakfast very good. Jorge
34,1524,"Sep 12 2006 	Excellent place to stay	I've been to this hotel a few times and always found clean rooms, and they do have different room categories for you to choose. The staff is friendly and they always help you with any questions you might have.It's a few minutes walk from St-Denis Street, great place!"
35,1524,"Aug 16 2006	Dirty smelly and possibly disease ridden	They don't mention anywhere on their website that they are also a hostel. Not to mention a very bad hostel who puts their guests in the musty basement. I am so sorry for anyone who books this hotel. Their pictures on their website are so cute and quaint, but I swear these rooms do not exist. The hotel staff is not friendly and helpful as some of the reviews state. I really think the positive reviews are writen by the hotel staff themselves. The walls were so thin that I could hear my neighbors urinating and every other sound they made! I can't believe this hotel has not been shut down for fraud. It truly is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Do yourself a favor, and stay someplace safe and nice for the same price! THE PLACE SMELLS AND THE SHEETS WERE FILTHY!Even worse, the front desk refused to refund my first night stay when I informed them I could not possibly sleep in such a dirty bed. I left and found a room at the Sheraton downtown and actually payed less than the Hotel de Paris."
36,1524,"Jul 5 2006	This hotel is a total scam; go elsewhere	I made a reservation with the hotel through their website for one night, 2 July 2006. My sister made a separate reservation for a 3-star superior room, for herself and her fiance for the same days. We both received e-mail confirmations. The day before we were expected to arrive, I received a phone call from the desk confirming a room upgrade to a 3-star superior room, I had made several weeks earlier. The man asked what time to expect my arrival and I stated that I will be arriving in the evening. He confimed everything and I assumed everything would go according to plan. When we arrived at the hotel, we stated at the desk that we had reservations, to which the young man at the desk asked &quot;If we had brought our own sheets?&quot;. Bewildered, we said &quot;No&quot; to which the man responded that it would be &quot;$3 per night for sheets.&quot; My sister then asked, &quot;Is this a hotel?&quot; The man stammered and said &quot;Yes&quot; and then proceeded to shuffle through a batch of receipts from individuals that had checked in. Then he said that he couldn't find our reservations based on these receipts. Neither of us could figure out why he didn't simply check the computer in front of him for our reservations. And how is it that I received a phone call from the hotel confirming my reservation the day before? The man said that the individual in question didn't know what he was talking about. We insisted that since he lost both our reservations (An unlikely coincidence) that he do us the courtesy of find us rooms. He insisted there was no space at the hotel. Strange, considering that 10 min. prior he was willing to offer us a room, albeit with their 'hostel' annex. He sent us to a shabby motel, saying that they had two rooms available. They did not. We went back, fuming. Finally, they made arrangements at a Best Western, more expensive, using my contact information, mysteriously made available from the computer. How is it that our reservations were lost when he was able to pull my name from the hotel computer? We spoke with the Hotel de Paris manager, Hector Zana, on the phone, who said that the hotel would pick up the difference in the room rates when we checked out the following day. However, when we called the manager, he was extremely rude and denied ever having the conversation or offering to pick up the difference in our tabs. We promptly called the police, which got the same rude response from the manager. What's worse, the manager said that we made the reservation through a non-affiliated website- a blatant lie as the hotel had sent us e-mail confirmations when we made the reservations. So here we were stuck paying $50 more after spending hours arguing with these people. Plus, we had to call our credit cards making sure that we were charged for the missed reservations as our accounts on the hotel's website were still 'active'. Our theory, that there are no such 3-star rooms and when the hotel realized that's what we were expecting, conveniently 'lost' 2 seperate reservations and bamboozled us by promising to cover the extra expense of costlier rooms elsewhere. Despite their nice website, this is not a true hotel but a hostel run by a bunch of con artists."
37,1524,"Jul 5 2006	Stay Away from Hotel de Paris	After making a reservation with the Hotel de Paris more then a month and a half ago and receiving a confirmation from their website, I assumed that my vacation in Montreal would go with out a hitch. Upon checking in, I tell the person at the desk that I have a reservation for the superior Queen Room in Annex 1. He then asks me if I want sheets...silly question of course! I then ask if the hotel de Paris was a hotel, to which he replies yes, but they also have a hostel. (What kind of hotel is 3 Star and has a hostel?) Anyway, the &quot;concierge&quot; proceeds to search for my reservation everywhere but the computer and informs me that he couldn't find my reservation and that the hotel was completely booked. Even with the confirmation information he was unwilling to be accommodating. There is a computer in the lobby and I checked my reservation and it was still active. How is it that they were unable to locate it? After almost 3 hours of trying to find us a room, the person at the desk finally called the Sam W, who I assume is the owner of the hotel. Sam W, instructed the person at the desk to find us a room in another hotel. The first hotel was Hotel de la Cassa. If this location is comparable to the Hotel de Paris then they really should remodel. First we had to be buzzed in to the Hotel de la Cassa and the women was behind what looked like a prison window and did not speak either French or English well and frankly the lobby smelled like cat pee. We needed two rooms and there was only one, so we had to return to the Hotel de Paris. Upon seeing us again, the person at the desk called back Sam W. After several minutes of them conversing Sam W promised that they would find us a room in another hotel and that the Hotel de Paris would pick up the difference. All we would have to do is call the manager Monday morning Hector Z. This was an obvious lie, because upon checking out of the hotel that they found for us on Monday, we called the manager Hector Z and he proceeded to say that Sam W had never spoken to him and that it wasnt his problem and that the reservation that I had made was through an independent web-site; not true at all since I went to the Hotel de Paris website and made the reservation through them and received a confirmation through the Hotel.After suspecting fraudulent activity (I am still monitoring my credit card) I contacted the police who said they would make a note of our situation, but it was a civil matter. I have my suspicions if they are actually a hotel. I am unsure why the Hotel de Paris is so highly rated. I would really think twice before staying here."
38,1524,"Jun 25 2006	Total Nightmare!!! Beware all!!!	I saw the hotel's website and liked the pictures of the rooms so I reserved their largest hotel room for my family. I should have heeded the other terrible reviews on this site, but like a fool I chose to stay here. It is not conveniently located as the reviews state as well. I have a feeling the hotel staff writes the good reveiws themselves. The building has been remodeled, but very badly. When we got to our room and opened the door, the smell was terrible and the room was the shabbiest $150 a night room I had ever seen. Although the bathroom was remodeled, it did not make up for the dirty green carpet, non working tv, tiny room for 6, and dirty radiator with garbage inside the floor area arouond the radiator. One of the beds, which were hard as rocks had a pull out bed. When I pulled it out, the sheets were filthy and the actual pullout drawer was disgusting, full of dirt and hair. When I informed the guy at the front desk, he said he would get us new sheets. My husband insisted on speaking with the owner, but the front desk guy said he had no idea where he was or when he would be there. We had to pay for one night, but never ended up staying there. That would have ruined our trip to Montreal. We got a room at the Springhill Suites in Old Town instead for $15 more a night. Also, the parking for $8 they offer is street parking and you cannot park on the street from 3 to 5 pm. We also found out the place mostly rents out beds to people who cannot afford rooms. The environment around the hotel was shady. We actually saw a group of people doing drugs around the corner. Horrible."
39,1524,"May 31 2006	Bring Earplugs!!!	Considering that recent reviews have been so positive, I was really disappointed with this place. My stay was over two nights in the &quot;Edith Piaf&quot; room, which is Room 14 in the &quot;annex.&quot; (The annex is the hotel's building on the SW corner of Sherbrooke &amp; St Andre. The main part of the hotel is on the NE corner.) My biggest problem with the hotel was that the walls were paper thin, and the guy staying in the adjacent Room 12 snored like a Harley Davidson at full throttle. He slept early in the night (7:30 even!), all night long, and well into the next morning. (We theorized he had sleep apnea because the buzzsawing was in fits and starts.) We could also hear TV sets, people urinating, etc. The room itself was attractive with a high ceiling and hardwood floors. The bed was rock hard, swayed worringly, and squeeked loudly with every slight movement. It wasn't a &quot;budget&quot; room since we paid a net of $298 CAD for the two nights. However, it was furnished like a budget room, with two small towels, no washrags, two tiny latherless pieces of &quot;Lisa&quot; soap (which were not replaced on the second day), no shampoo, no hair dryer, no nothing. The wall was peeling, the thermostat didn't seem to work (it was hot/sultry despite the lowest setting), and there was a faint odor of old tobacco even though there were no drapes/carpeting to harbor such an odor. Parking was in a tiny, dark, dirty garage below an apartment house, for $8 per day. I would step into a puddle of goopy water when I exited the car at my assigned parking space. ( However, you would in all likelihood be able to find parking on St Andre just north of Sherbrooke if you don't mind leaving your car on the street. )In summary, the hotel was underwhelming. If you dare to stay here, pray that your neighbors are not snorers!!!"
40,1524,"Apr 15 2006	Make yourself at home...	This is the third time I stay at L`Hotel de Paris in Montreal. It seems everytime I come it only gets better. They have a variety of room types available. This time I opted for the suite (room 37 i think it was) and i gotta say, wow! Its a large room, with a big bed and a nice balcony up front. It seems they`ve done some renovations over the winter because i noticed all the corridors have been redone and really spruces up the place. A nice new thing they offer is a free continental breakfast. They also have a Bistro on site but it was only opening in April. The staff is very friendly and really make you feel at home. Its not a huge hotel so I guess it is easier to make a personal connection with the clients. There`s a new young guy working there whos a lot of fun and full of good advice about the city. I recommend this place and I`d defintalely keep coming back."
41,1524,"Dec 11 2005 	Very satisfactory	I attend a conference in Montreal every December and stay here all the time. The rooms are clean and comfortable and for the first time this year they added a free breakfast! I noticed that there were some other changes also and the place is quaint and very Montreal. I find the location convenient, the staff reliable and friendly and I like the price!"
42,1524,"Dec 11 2005	the room matters	I stayed here based entirely on the price. The adds said 69$ so i figured, if it's decent, for that price i'd stay. And the 69$ price, was the value of the room. It was not perfectly kept, but i was good enough to sleep in for me, and i'd say most people. Then i asked what the other more expensive rooms were like, and they said: &quot;nicer&quot; So i had a look, and for some more money, the rooms were a significant step up. So, i bought a more expensive room, and it was luxurious. I think that the bad reviews about the rroms are from people paying 69$ for a room and expective the luxury suites. Look if you pay the 120$ to get the luxury sweet you get a luxury swet, it you pay 69 buck, you get a 69$ room. Hotel de paris is not the greatest deal of all time, but it's fair, and you get what you pay for, plus there are some perks, lik the nice costomer service. I'd stay here againjim, from victoria BC"
43,1524,"Nov 25 2005	Disappointed	I was quite disappointed when I got to my room. I had high expectations due to all of the good reviews this place was receiving. I rented a standard 2 double bedroom suite. There were holes in the walls, loose tiles in the washroom, mold on the walls in the washroom, not enough towels.... the only good thing about this hotel was the customer service. The people at the desk were friendly and gave us information regarding places to visit/go in montreal. overall: very disappointed."
44,1524,"Nov 23 2005	This place is AWFUL	I stayed at this hotel with my husband. Everything about this place was terrible. The ceiling was leaking, it smelled of mold. I asked for a better room and the guy at the desk said 'I don't have they key to the good room.'"
45,1524,"Nov 6 2005	For a good time in Montreal follow these directions...	I have been to Montreal a number of times and have stayed at this hotel a few times. Basically, it is cheap, clean and central with a good dose of old world charm.However-when I visited this time my whole view of the hotel-and Montreal-completely changed. WHAT A HOTEL CAFE! The food was fantastic, super cheap, and the girls running it really made my visit! They made me maps and told me exactly where to go to really experience Montreal. I have been to Montreal a number of times but this time was the first I didn't feel like a tourist. The cafe is a meeting point for fellow travellers and local, with people meeting up for coffee or drinks while they explore the city. Apparently they also have a hip hop brunch on Saturdays! It's all the best of Montreal-vibrant and hip while remaining friendly and accessible. I am planning my next visit right now-and wouldn't stay anwyhere else!"
46,1524,"Oct 27 2005	Perfect for a girls night out	We stayed at this Hotel a bunch of times now and we simply love it! Everytime we go to Montreal for a girls night out, we always rent the ATTIC room (room 43 I think)and we have a blast! We usually are 6 - 8 girls, so for us, the deal is great. There is plenty of room for everyone to sleep - the room has 4 double beds, so no one ever has to sleep on the floor! Girls, just one tip though - bring an extra mirror! There is only one in the bathroom and it's tiny!! Just to avoid any cat fights!LOL!"
47,1524,"Sep 8 2005	Room in Hotel De Paris	They charge you first($150/night) then show you the aweful room. Then they say if you want a better room you have to pay more!!if you want to leave you have to pay for first night!! It is rip off businessgoing on this hotel.It was very bad. They have ruined PARIS's name.a guest for two nights Sep/2,3/2005."
48,1524,"Aug 31 2005	Balcony rooms are great	Just stayed at the Hotel de Paris (not the hostel next door) for the third time with my husband. We really enjoy the place, but I think it is probably not for everyone.First, it would not be for anyone with bad knees. Just getting into the lobby is quite a steep climb from the street. Second, it would not be for light sleepers - at least not on summer weekends. Montreal is a late-night town, and the rooms at the front, especially, get a lot of street noise. That said, we like to stay in the front, in one of two rooms with a rooftop balcony - a fantastic place to chill with a beverage and some conversation. In fact, the balcony is the whole point for us - the view of Rue Sherbrooke and downtown is wonderful. We've stayed in both rooms that share the balcony, and they were both nice. We were much less impressed with the standard, balcony-less room where we stayed on our first visit. Of course, the balcony makes sense only in the summer. In the winter it's likely to have four feet of snow on it.The hotel would not be a bad choice in the neighborhood, even if you opt for the less expensive rooms without the balcony. It's clean enough, the staff is decent, the decor is pleasant if slightly faded. But there may be better choices. In fact, in winter we prefer to stay across the street and down a block at the more comfortable but slightly less atmospheric Hotel Chateau de l'Argoat.If you do stay in the neighborhood, don't miss Parc LaFontaine, a great place for a stroll or a run. In winter there is ice skating in a pond with high embankments that protect skaters from the wind.I'm also a big fan of the Cafe Cherrier, a bistro at Cherrier &amp; St. Denis."
49,1524,"Jul 9 2005	Good hotel if you get the big room!	I went to Hotel de Paris a couple of years ago, but I had such a fun experience, why not write a review now! I went with three friends so we either got a deluxe room or a suite. I wish I remember the room number, the room was a great value. There was a spiral staircase leading up to the attic room (huge room with two corners that had slanted ceilings), four full size beds (we were only expecting two!) and a full kitchen, dining table and bathroom.The location is great too. Close to all- we walked everywhere, even to/from the Greyhound station. We got there early and they let us wait in a standard room until our room was ready. That room was pretty mediocre, but not terrible. Just motel-ish.The place is nothing fancy and don't expect much service, but I can at least vouch for the big rooms and privacy! Ask for the attic room with four beds if you wanna have fun with friends.."
50,1524,"Jun 20 2005	Rude Obnoxious Staff	I stayin this dump for the Grand Prix weekend and I thought I was going to catch some sort of plague from it's disgustingly dirty showers and bathrooms. One of the four showers, that served thirty people, only worked in the scalding hot position. I left a pair of sunglasses there when I left and even though I told the staff exactly where I left them and asked them nicely if they would look for them, they refused and when I called back the second time I was abruptly told that they were not found and then I was hung up on. Also the Air-Conditioning unit for the entire building was IN our room and even if you could stand the noise of it, it was impossible to sleep because it was too cold in the room."
51,1524,"Jun 13 2005	Horrible place to stay!	They say on the hostel website that all the bathrooms and matresses are new; I don't know about the matresses but the bathrooms certainly were not new, they had mold on the walls and only one of the three toilets with showers locked and up to 40 people had to share those 3 toilets!!The bunk beds felt like they were about to fall apart and the room smelt damp.The staff are extremely rude and if you ask for a refund of your deposit after you see the room they won't give it back to you either!It is a rip-off for the quality you get. The Hotel La Residence next door actually worked out cheaper than the hostel!! (when u added the price of renting sheets, a towel and buying a little breakfast). It was small, but it was clean and they were very friendly.I wouldnt advise anyone to stay at the Hotel de Paris hostel, and i don't think the hotel is much better I heard from talking to guests staying in the hotel part, apart from one or two rooms that is."
52,1524,"Jun 1 2005 	Clean Hotel/Hostal	I stayed at Hotel de Paris in May and it was very clean and neat... I went there with my girl and I must say that we are a very picky bunch, but we all agreed that this we would stay here for the weekend. I t was comfortable. We stayed in a budget suite for 4 adults I think it was, with two double beds and a 13' tv.. We had a view of the street so we see our car parked on the side street. There was not much parking . The parking for this building was in another building, how weird is that. It was very complicated. Whenever you went out you had to go to the front desk and ask for the key, then return it when you got your car out... A bit too much walking around. Terrible parking arrangements and they charge $8/day....... and you're not even garaunteed a parking because they share..This hotel has no elevator so you have to stair it... Its located in an ok location. The clubs (try Cresent St. or St Laurent )are about 30 mins walk, eatry and other action St. Denis about 2 stop lights up ( very busy- a lot of food places and store along this street). Another busy street St Catherines. Don't forget to check out Victoria Sq... about 15 - 20 mins drive away.Overall this hotel was clean, beds were made, bathroom clean, cable tv - the staff was helpful somewhat friendly - parking sucks, but it is reasonable and clean, what more can you ask for...Don't be scared because it is a hostal because honestly, I didn't know about it until i read it somewhere and that was when I was leaving, checking out. It was nowhere near a hostal in my eyes..The outer decor is a bit ancient but don't be fooled, the place is clean.Enjoy your stay like I did at Hotel De Paris"
53,1524,"May 22 2005	Nice little hotel	This is a smaller hotel with nice clean rooms. I stayed in what was called a budget room with a double bed. The room was clean, with a cute bathroom and cable T.V. All in all, a great little place for the price. The hotel had nice staff, a great location and a good breakfast with plenty of parking. All in all we had a very pleasurable stay."
54,1524,"Feb 25 2004	great value for money	This is a very good little hotel, very reasonably priced with a wide variety of rooms. I saw some really large beautiful rooms as well as some very small ones at great prices. There is also an affiliated youth hostel across the street, so you can sleep in montreal right downtown at any price range you choose, from $20 to $140 canadian. I stayed with my wife in a very clean budget room at $75 canadian dollars (about $60 US) we had a private bathroom and the front desk was very helpful."
55,1524,"Nov 21 2003	Any other hotel is better! ANY!	This place must have one or two good rooms, if one is to believe the reviews, but the rest are a total pig sty! Smelly, smokey, filthy, old, thread-bare, utterly disgusting. I think the pictures on the net are fake, or hugely PhotoShopped. The staff is rude, too. These guys have buildings all over the street, nobody on site. Unbelievable bad choice. Any other hotel on Sherbrooke West is better, and cheaper! Don't waste your time and money, you may catch something from those sheets, too! UGH!"
56,1524,"Nov 10 2003	Great locarion	This hotel was actually very good. The location is ideal. I had a luxury room at $125 canadian and everything was brand new including the furniture. The place was spotless. Also my daughter who will attend University in Montreal stayed at the adjacent youth hostel and had a good time and met some new friends, also students looking for apartments. Someone seems to have an axe to grind about this place. I was very satisfied."

We loved the king sized suite that even had extra pillows and blanket which you usually don't get in a king size room. There was a kitchennette which was handy and a charming local grocery right next door. Parking was easy. The staff was especially friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the location- it was quiet from the noise of the city yet right in the heart of the downtown restaurants and sights.

Close to Subways station. The problem is you need walk through the tunnel about 5 mins for highup walk!! From station walk to the hotel about 10 mins. Tip: Another station nearby and you don't need walk through the tunnel, you need change the line not direct to the hotel is the problem!!Not much trouble, many restaurant nearby the hotel, post office and supermarket very close too. Although not too close to downtown but the subway very easy to catch and cheap too.Happy our stayes at Hotel Du Fort"
3,1526,"Oct 19 2009 	Will defintely stay at Hotel Du Fort again.	I chose this hotel because of the mostly postive reviews here, and I wasn't disappointed. I think it's a pretty good value compared to nearby places. We had one of the smaller rooms but it was still plenty big enough, with a small kitchenette hidden behind folding doors. (And a little coffeepot plus a real mug and spoon!) Everything was clean, and we had a wonderful view from our window.There were a lot of restaurants within a few blocks; maybe not the really nicehigh-end places, but moderately priced places, with lots of ethnic food choices. The old city was a bit far for us to walk to, but we just drove down and parked in that big lot by the water. I'd skip the breakfast buffet and go to Tutti Fruitti instead - it's about three blocks away on St. Catherine."
4,1526,"Oct 14 2009 	Good Comfortable Hotel With Some Issues	Stayed at Hotel du Fort Montreal for a one week vacation this past August. The hotel is located on Rue(Street) Fort right off St. Catherine, the main commercial street in the city.Please note that this section of St, Catherine is not the commercial downtown section withall the chic shops and restaurants - rather, the area where the hotel is located is a largelyresidential, quieter section of Montreal - not a bad thing as you will find many interesting shops and boutiques and reasonably priced restaurants here.The hotel is about 20 minutes walking distance from downtown; there are also three Metro stations within a three to four block radius of the Hotel du Fort (Atwater, Guy Concordia and Georges-Vanier) to get you anywhere in the city you want to go. The Georges-Vanier station is just two stops away from the Central train station for those arriving or leaving Montreal by train.As for the hotel itself, it is a medium-sized residential-style property with large, spacious and quite comfortable rooms with spectacular views of the city especially from the upper floors. The room type I stayed in was the King Signature which had a siiting area with a sofa and lounge chair.A wooden divider with a makeup table, lamp and hair dryer separated this living area from the sleeping area which contained the bed and a small chair. In addition, the room contains a large desk, armoire with a TV and dresser drawers, a large closet, a kitchenette with refrigerator, and a good-sized bathroom. The bathroom was well-appointed with such convieniences as seperate switches for the light and the fan, safety bars in the shower, a non-slip tub floor and a laundry line, features which are not always found in more expensive properties, at least not all in one room. That said, this bathroom had two items which I found rather disappoiting - a very powerful shower with a narrow water jet which was anything but comfortable (and non-adjustable). Also, instead of the usual bottles of toiletries, there were wall dispensers in the shower for shampoo, soap, etc. Perhaps the hotel is trying to be enviromentally freindly but I found this rather cheesy and motel-like for hotel of this caliber. One other observation regarding the room - the website indicates all the rooms have flatscreen TVs - this turns out not to be the case. When I asked the manager on duty about this he said that those TVs are only in the suites. This may be important to some, not so much to others, but I thought I should mention it.Now, to the issues I alluded to in the title of my review. These concern the breakfast and thebusiness center. The breakfast buffet (no ala carte menu available) served in a very elegantroom with large picture windows is described on the website as having hot and cold items - in truth, the only hot item every morning was scrambled eggs. The other items were of the continental variety - fruit, pastries, cold cuts juice, coffee. The breakfast was certainly not bad, but for the price $9.95 CAD I did expect a bit more.As to the business center, (located right off the breakfast room) please note that there is onlyone computer available fro everyone's use. During my stay, I usually had to wait longer thanusual to use the computer; this experience culminated one night with several guests inckud-ing myself complaining about one guest hogging the computer for over an hour. To the hotel's everlasting credit, the front desk staff remedied this situation immediatel and removed the offender. Also to their credit, I recently received a letter fron the hotel manager apologiz- ing for my experience in this matter and told me that the computer use policy has since been revised to allow each guest 15 minutes use on said computer, and in addition I was offered a complimentary room upgrade for a future stay. I sincerely hope that this policy will be adher- ed to and respected by all the guests. What this would mean is how much of a priority the use of the business center is to you during your vacation.The front desk staff was very freindly and efficient in all other matters as well. They mademe feel very welcome and made many recommendations for my sightseeing, restaurant andtransportation needs while in Montreal. In regard to the latter, the concierge can furnish youwith an Opus card for $5.00 which is good for unlimited trips on the city's subways and buses. You can refill the card yourself when the encoded value runs out. You must return thecard at checkout or you will be charged the $5.00 on your bill.The housekeeping staff were also excellent except for an unknown housekeeper who (withgood intentions I'm sure) left my room windows open on the two hottest days of my stay. Thiswas not a big issue though and I let it pass.In summary, the Hotel du Fort is a very pleasant hotel to stay in. Centrally located in a quaint, quiet neighborhood, it has large comfortable rooms, a caring staff and reasonable rates. And if the above issue with the business center are indeed resolved, then the hotel will be evenmore inviting.P.S. For those of you looking for additional shopping and dining, there is a large shopping mallthree blocks from the hotel. It is the Place Alexis-Nihon and contains a McDonalds (good forbreakfast and sinfully delicious pastries - believe me on this!), a food court and shops for all your needs, especially the basic things you may need for your trip. It is located atop the Atwater Metro station and across the street from the Pepsi Forum (a huge sports-entertainment complex)."
5,1526,"Oct 9 2009 	A Small Apartment - Great Location	Great time in Montreal. Hotel is older and was like having a small, comfy apartment in the city. We had a huge corner room with a kitchenette, bedroom, dining room and living room - extremely comfortable. It's right off St. Catherine Blvd. where we walked to restaurants and the center of the city. We chose to take a taxi to Old Montreal vs. drive. It's too far to walk. The breakfast is in a lovely dining room and was okay at $9.95, but we typically had breakfast in our room. A grocery store is across the street. Free internet was great and parking was only $18 a day. The halls had a little musty smell, but we didn't notice it in our very clean room. It was a little dated, but very comfortable and we would stay again."
6,1526,Oct 6 2009 	Good location good value top marks	Hotel Du Fort is in a great location for exploring the City by foot or on the Subway. It is located off one of the main shopping and restaurant roads so there's plenty of choice for meals.Our room was spacious and comfortable. We found the hotel staff helpful and happy to help.
7,1526,"Sep 15 2009 	Comfortable 	We stayed only one night at the Hotel du Fort but we wished we'd booked for longer. Stayed here on our annual trip to drop our son off at McGill. It was not too far from his apartment and convenient to the Metro and downtown. The room was huge, bed comfortable, price reasonable. Parking was convenient and about the going rate for a city hotel (around $18 I think). Nice view of downtown. The exercise room was nice and well equipped but for some odd reason the treadmill was locked and required a special key from the front desk. My only complaint is the for-fee internet access. I HATE paying for internet access."
8,1526,"Sep 4 2009 	Highly recommend	Hotel staff was very courteous &amp; helpful. Room was clean, large &amp; had a beautiful view. Kitchenette was clean &amp; very appreciated. In-room safe was a great feature. Location was close enough to some sites &amp; very accessible by Metro for farther sights. I will stay here again &amp; recommend it highly. After staying at a horrible hotel in Ottawa on the same trip, Hotel Du Fort was refreshing."
9,1526,"Aug 31 2009	Nice stay right in the center of Montreal	I have selected the hotel based on reviews on Tripadvisor and it turned out pretty good. We stayed 4 days. It is located next to St Catherine street which is walking distance to shopping centers, great restautants and underground city. There were two grocery stores accross hotel. Hotel is about 5 min walk to the subway which was very convenient for us coming to the hotel from the train station, as well as travelling to botanical garden and Olympic Stadium. All staff spoke English and were pretty helpful. The room was nice and pretty big with king bed and sofa. Nice bathroom. I also used the gym in the hotel which was not big but had enough machines to exercise. Very nice value for the price we paid. Hotel exceeded our expectations. I will definetely stay again and recommend to the friends."
10,1526,"Aug 31 2009 	Good Value Hotel in Convenient Location.	Stayed here for a couple of nights during a roadtrip across Canada &amp; USA. Had seen the reviews on Tripadvisor &amp; got a discounted rate from the tourist information place. The hotel is very clean &amp; has friendly efficient service. There is parking at the hotel. I really liked our room, it had a great view &amp; the bed was very comfy. It is around a 10-15 minute walk to the shopping areas &amp; bars/restaurants etc. Recommended."
11,1526,"Aug 22 2009 	Great Hotel 	I stayed there for my Birthday and overall a great trip. No meals or that included, but averall a good value. It was close to the metro for easy access to shopping, clubs and other activities. Very clean and pretty good meals in the restaurant."
12,1526,"Jul 30 2009 	Better than we had hoped for	Wife and I stayed at the Du Fort for 5 nights, July 5-10. We got in very late via train from Niagara Falls, so didn't get to see the area till the next morning.Check in was great, the room was a very unexpected surprise. Nice and roomy,great bath amenities and the little kitchenette area was very useful. The view was ok. If we looked to the left we had a view of Mount Royal Park and to the right , we could see a little of the water. We didn't come for views from our room. It was our first visit to Montreal so out the door we went. We were always greeted warmly by all the staff.Riza , almost was hurt if we didn't let her clean our room. We had put the &quot;do not deturb sign out one day. She almost insisted we allow her to clean it. She always made sure we had plenty of amenities in room. Thank you Riza.You have to choices for the subway. Atwater or Guy-Concordia. The walk to Atwater, is a little more depressing , but they do have some great shopping and food courts. But the food court we liked even more was Faubourg on St Catherine, about 2.5 blocks from the Du Fort. They had food from around the world. 3 Chinese,1 Japanese,2Italian,1 Indian,1 Thai, 2 Sandwich shops, 1 Lebanese ( Samirs) is great. There were a few others that escape my mind. One of our favorites was Saint Cinnamon, on the lower floor. The egg croissant sandwich is big,tasty and a great buy. Very filling , kept us going through the day, till we found where we might want to eat.Beer is very expensive all over in bars,restaurants. You can buy at the stores that sell to take back to your room at a better cost. But we did come across Brutopia.com about 5-6 blocks east of hotel. There beers were $Can5 per pint during there happy hour, and a generous happy hour it was, 3-8 every night.It was our first trip to Montreal and it was a fantastic one, starting with the Hotel Du Fort.Thank you for everything."
13,1526,"Jul 18 2009 	EXCELLENCE ALL AROUND!	Stayed at Du Fort for 4 nights with my friends and absolutely loved it. Service is exceptional, rooms are spacious, location is excellent! Hotel Du Fort is located 6 blocks away from Crescent St. (if you are a college student its the place to be) and right next to St Catherines (all the restaurants and shops). Everything is in a walkable distance and away from all the noise. The hotels staff is professional and friendly. Metro is few blocks down, the closest bar is across the street (Sports bar--very cheap breakfast and bar food). Also parking is about 20 bucks a day with in and out access (but you really dont need your car, metro will take you practically everywhere)TIPSCrescent St- BARS, CLUBSSt Catherines- FOOD, SHOPPINGSt Laurent- CLUBSSt Dennis- HOOKAH BARS"
14,1526,"Jul 7 2009 	An Amazing Boutique Hotel Where ""Hospitality"" is Their Standard!	This gem is off the beaten path but is extremely convenient to just about anywhere you'd want to go in charming Montreal. I can't recall a hotel where everyone...and I do mean everyone...is quietly there for you and more than willing to make your stay as comfortable and hassle free as it can be. My wife and I experienced this with all from the front desk, to the chamber maid on up to the General Manager! They are all glad that you are their guest...and they show it.The rooms are very spacious, clean and have a very handy kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, sink and coffee/tea and a coffeemaker. Very easy to feel&quot;at home&quot;.This hotel must have the best smelling elevators in town as the aroma of freshly baked croissants waif up from the beautiful breakfast parlor on the second floor. Here is a wonderful breakfast buffet serving hot and cold fresh foods to satisfy any appetite.If you're looking for a worry free, wonderful hotel that delivers more than it promises, we heartily recommend this Montreal gem to you. You'll be glad you followed this advice!"
15,1526,"Jul 6 2009 	Handy location Superbly friendly staff comfy beds	Having kitchenettes in the rooms drastically reduced our overall trip expenses. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. We have stayed there periodically since 2002, and always appreciate the accommodations and the location is wonderful for us - just minutes from local transportation."
16,1526,"Jul 5 2009 	Good basic hotel. Very friendly staff.	We stayed at the Hotel du Fort for the first time this July. The best part for us was the friendly staff. They were courteous and helpful. The room we stayed in was large and comfortable, the decor was pretty basic. The only problem we encountered was the first room we were in had not been cleaned before our arrival, and had a damaged tub faucet. We were very quickly moved to a new room which was larger than the one we started in. The rooms are comfortable and well-appointed. There was a small kitchen area which was great for storing extra food and keeping it cold before we traveled again, and there was an area for drying your hair with a mirror built into a table. Rue du Fort is just off Saint Catherine, so there are many restaurants and shops in the area, though we did find ourselves walking quite a lot to see some of the attractions we were interested in. The last day of our stay we went to the breakfast buffet (not included in the cost of the room) and liked it a lot. We would stay here again and would recommend it to others. The Hotel displayed an electronic &quot;billboard&quot; near the elevators detailing Concierge recommendations. This was a nice touch."
17,1526,"Jul 3 2009 	Excellent hotel	I stayed here for two nights to attend a conference in Westmount. Although there was an initial mix up with my room, it was quickly and pleasantly sorted out. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed; the toiletries are delightful. The front desk staff was always helpful, no matter the time of day or the number of guests they were handling at the time. In particular, they knew just how to hail a cab! The breakfast is very good and, again, the staff in the breakfast room equally pleasant. I plan to return to Hotel du Fort the next time I am in Montreal."
18,1526,"Jul 1 2009 	Adventure Central	We love Hotel du Fort. We have recommended it to several of our friends and they have never come away dissatisfied. We are frequent fliers at the hotel; it's our first choice!Hotel du Fort is located in an &quot;up and coming&quot; area of Montreal. The Pepsi Arena is nearby as are new restaurants (Le Mizo, etc). There are many shops and botiques in the area as well as stores where one may expeirence local produce and cuisine. The Atwater Metro is two blocks near-by. The hotel is conveniently located and easily accessible to the weary traveller or those seeking some adventure. The parking garage is exceptionally clean and well lighted and everything is handicap accessible.Hotel du Fort continually seeks to improve service to its guests. The new breakfast menue has ben modified to be more pleasing to the guests.The staff, as e veryone agrees is very professional and welcoming. They are very patient with me when I try to speak French at the front desk (merci). Everyone should experience Hotel du Fort.TMAP"
19,1526,"Jun 27 2009 	Nice clean hotel	Good location, large clean rooms, quiet. The hallway on the floor we stayed on smelled a little weird, but other than that it's a nice hotel."
20,1526,"Jun 26 2009 	Splendid Stay	My husband and I stayed for 4 nights at this hotel in June and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff is very professional and do a great job of answering your questions thoroughly.This hotel just off a major street (Saint Catherine) and close to Guy-Concordia or the Atwater Metro stops. The hotel room was large and had a great kitchette with a sink, frig., microwave and coffeemaker. The lovely bathroom was very large too. The hotel had a nice gym, and a grocery store and Internet cafe across the street. There are lots of stores, resturants and bars along St. Catherine, so finding a place to eat was not difficult. Many of the bars &amp; resturants have English menus and the people of Montreal speak English well and often. The hotel had a great sports bar across the street (Sports Stadium?) the place had great food, cheap beer, and tasty poutine (fries, with beef, gravy and melted cheese curds) Yum! Gotta' try it! Montreal is a large city and the major sites are spread out, so be prepared to walk, drive or take the Metro subway. At the airport we were able to get to our hotel very easily and inexpensively by using two public buses and the subway. Make sure you have exact change before you get on the bus! We did not have a car, but used the subway countless times throughout our trip to get to what we wanted to see. The subway is very user friendly, but get a 3 day pass because the cost of a ride is $2.75, no matter the distance. The people of Montreal are so nice and helpful. We loved visiting Montreal and we'd go back again and would stay at the Hotel Du Fort ."
21,1526,"May 10 2009 	A surprise!	A fellow traveler selected this place. I was skeptical due to the location, and on first impression of the outside and the neighborhood. But inside the place was nicer than it looked. And on getting out into the neighborhood, there were lots of stores and shops within a block or two that made the visit unexpectedly pleasant. Unless you know your way around Montreal or are exceptional at directions, better take a GPS to get there from the airport. It's in an old part of town with lots of one-way streets crisscrossed by freeways."
22,1526,May 9 2009 	Comfortable and spacious	This is a great little hotel with spacious rooms and kitchenette (very handy for snacks and breakfasts) Beds are comfortable and linens are very nice. The location can't be beat -- 2 minutes to Ste Catherine.
23,1526,May 2 2009 	Loved the breakfast	I got a suite in this hotel thanks to my travel agent at the same cost as a normal room. my office was only a 5 min walk from here on st. catherines. the front desk is very help ful to tourists and they helped me identifying the must visit spots in montreal. they also informed me about the events happening in the weekend.The american breakfast is included in the room expense. it is quite good. you will find many tourists in the hotelthe hotel has a gym though it is very small. you will get internet connectivity to complete your office work but you may find it on the slower side.
24,1526,Feb 19 2009 	all round good hotel	Stayed there for a weekend. It wasn't the best but it was quite good for the price. The location of the hotel is within downtown and is walkable to the subway station and other main attractions.
25,1526,"Jan 4 2009 	Very friendly and comfortable place to stay	The Hotel Du Fort was a real pleasure to stay in during my last visit to Montreal. Location wise the hotel is just of Rue Sainte-Catherine which has a great choice of cafes, bars and shops. Its about a 10 minute walk to the nearest Metro stations of Atwater and Guy-Concordia, I would recommend using the latter station. The city centre is easy to reach by metro and can also be reached by foot in about 20 to 30 minutes.Taxi from the airport cost me CAD38.00 but its a set fare in Montreal to the city centre hotels.The staff at the Hotel Du Lac I found to be absolutely brilliant, very professional, helpful and polite. Especially the staff on reception. Though all the staff that I passed during my stay from cleaners to managers took time to smile and say hello which really makes a difference.I was allocated room 1809 which was very spacious, well decorated, clean and very comfortable. Room has 2 double beds and a small kitchenette with a fridge and a microwave. Good sized bathroom and with being on the 18th floor an excellent view of downtown Montreal.Breakfast was at CAD10.00 in a pleasant comfortable room, decent buffet spread and pleasant service.Definetly will stay here again on my next time in Montreal."
26,1526,"Nov 18 2008	Trouble from the start......	We booked our hotel online with a great rate, or so we thought. I wanted to spend a wonderful weekend in Montreal for Thanksgiving and all we had from the hotel was trouble from the day we booked. They charged our credit card 4 times, (over $2200.00 for four nights) at one point we never had any credit left on our card because the hotel didn't want to stop charging us. When we thought we had it all fixed, a month after our return home we were charged again. But this time we were on another trip (a cruise) and tried to rent a car and our credit card got declined because the Hotel du fort charged our card yet again!!!! I wouldn't deal with this hotel again if it were the last hotel in Montreal!!!"
27,1526,"Nov 7 2008 	Best Keep Secret - Montreal Gem	My boyfriend and I were both very impressed with hotel du Fort. A four star property in the best location for the price of a three star. In town for festivale Juste Pour Rire we were is good spirits, but nothing went wrong anyway. I am very picky and have very high expectations. In North America, I accept no less than a four star. I ran my finger atop the mantel for dust. I was impressed. We recommend this hotel for cosmopolitan twenty-something Canadians and others with comparable taste."
28,1526,"Nov 7 2008	Loved it	I recently stayed at the Hotel du Fort for a week at the beginning of October, 2008 and two days at the end of the same month. I am a professional travel writer so I spend A LOT of time in hotels. I didn't know what to expect, but the online reviews were good, so I gave the Hotel du Fort a shot. I am very glad I did. When I called to reserve, the woman who answered was friendly and professional. When I checked in, I was pleased to find that the room was spacious and had a nice view of the city. It was also very clean and well appointed. Everyone on the staff was friendly, bilingual and helpful. The capper was when my wife called from overseas and asked if the staff could help her give me an anniversary present. One of the front desk staff went out and bought chocolates and a card and hand delivered them to my room. The Hotel du Fort hits all the right notes and it was very pleasant to come &quot;home&quot; to each day. I highly recommend it. It is a great value for the price. What more can I say? I wish all the places I stay in were like this."
29,1526,"Oct 30 2008 	Great Place Great Staff	The best thing, among many good things, at the Hotel Du Fort is the helpfulness of the front desk and concierge. They always had great information about things to do and places to eat. The location is also great just off Catherine St., but far enough off that we did not notice any noise. The Hotel Du Fort is quite reasonably priced. We would definitely stay here again. If you are driving be sure to reserve a place in the underground garage. At $20 a day with in and out privileges it is steal."
30,1526,Oct 22 2008 	Great rooms views and location	My boyfriend and I spent a weekend at the Hotel du Fort over the summer. The location was perfect - we walked everywhere. We were very impressed with the size and cleanliness of the rooms. Would definitely stay again.
31,1526,"Oct 21 2008	Excellent	We spent 4 nights here and thought it was fantastic. Our room was big with a kitchenette and sitting area and a decent size bathroom. The service was impeccable. We didn't have the breakfast so I can't comment on that. The location of the hotel is also good, only about 10 minutes walk from the Eaton Centre and 2 blocks from the Metro. There are some good restaurants nearby as well as a supermarket so everything is convenient. Highly recommended!"
32,1526,Sep 2 2008	LOVED DU FORT	The Du Fort is ideally located only steps away from St Catherine's Street. VERY clean.With the exception of one crabby guy at reception the rest of the staff were friendly and helpful.A definite must and for the price .. it was a great deal!!!!!Will definitely stay at the Du Fort on our next trip back to Montreal.
33,1526,"Aug 26 2008 	A first rate experience.	I have been at the hotel with my wife for a weekend at the end of our vacation. We found the staff to be friendly and really helpful on this our first visit to Montreal. They helped us plan our day, do the online check-in for our flight home, (and printed the boarding passes) and for an extra fee ($50) extended our checking-out time, essentially giving us another morning to explore the area.We stayed on the 10th floor {1011} - the view is fine and the room is unusually large (though probably one of the smaller ones). We agree that the hotel is a little way out from the centre but found the immediate area alive with all manner of characters and types. If this is a problem, take a taxi! We used the metro station on Guy and also Attwater though there is a bit of a walk at both ends of your journey whichever you use. There is the supermarket opposite the hotel which gives you the flexibility to use the kitchenette provided in the room. We also had two enjoyable meals at the pastaria at 1836A Ste Catherine O, just a block and a half away from the hotel; good value and treated like on of the family. The hotel is involved in the &quot;a la carte express&quot; scheme, so food can be ordered in if that suits.We slept very well, rarely disturbed by others and paid for our breakfast which was $10 + taxes. The hotel has recently added scrambled eggs (and beans - didn't try those) to the breakfast bar which gives it more variety but it is still not an English/American breakfast. The only slight negative we had was the microwave smelled of popcorn.TV in the room has a fair selection of French/English language channels and a selection of movies.We considered the hotel a real bargain, good value for money with excellent staff and would happily return."
34,1526,"Aug 15 2008 	Little ""outside"" but definately worth it	We have been at the hotel for a whole week. i want to say that i have never seen such a polite, service oriented so wanting to help staff at the reception. Really. Anytime i needed them they were more then happy to help.We stayed at the 17th floor - the view is great.So, as i said at the title, the hotel is a little on the &quot;side&quot; and not the center BUT rue du fort is at the corner of Rue St. Catherine and that is a major shopping and restaurant street. a 10 min walk on that street and you are really downtown.The metro station is a 7 minute walk. You have a super market right next to teh hotel, a pharmacy, where to do your laundry, amc- movie hall, and right infront of the entrance of the hotel a 24 hour internet coffee. Hotel has a free internet connection at the business center, but it was busy most of the time i tried to be there..wireless is 10$ a day at the hotel.I had some issues with maintenance noise at 7 am and a maid who didnt give a damn, but issues were fixed immidiately.Continental breakfast is served on floor 2 and was quite nice and not expensive (~17$ per adult and half for a child).TV in the room has a nice selection of movies to choose from, should you want to.All in all - I thought the hotel is truely worth its price, its comforatble and excellent staff. I would come here again."
35,1526,"Jul 26 2008 	Great first stay in Montreal!	We stayed at this hotel from July 18 - 21, 2008. We were in town for the purposes of attending a concert.LOCATION: Excellent. Close to the Metro which really is the best way to get a round Montreal during the day. A little west of the hotel was a bit of a sketchy area, but no one bothered us. Lots of great places to eat close by - especially recommend the Three Amigos about 2 blocks east of the hotel on St. Catherines. Great food, great price, and we love that we could go out to eat in Montreal at midnight on a Saturday night. Also loved Old Montreal. Amazing! Mont Royal Park was also a must see.ROOMS: Huge and really reasonable. The kitchenette was great, loved our view of the city from the 18th floor. Fireworks each night of the weekend were visible in the distance. Rooms were a bit dated in decor but nothing to complain about at all. Rooms exceptionally clean and great, prompt, friendly housekeeping every day.STAFF: The front desk staff was more than willing to spend time with you to let you know what to do in Montreal and how to get around, hail you a cab, or whatever else you needed.I really had no complaints whatsoever, will stay again if in Montreal!"
36,1526,"Jul 24 2008 	Well located comfortable hotel	I stayed at the Hotel du Fort for a week whilst at a conference. The hotel's location is good: near the bars, shops and restaurants of Rue St Catherine without being noisy. I walked to the conference centre each day (an interesting 30 minute walk) but got cabs back each night from various parts of the old town for about C$10 +tip.The room was large, clean and comfortable with excellent city views and powerful quiet airconditioning. Having a kitchenette in the room was great. Reception staff were helpful and efficient and managed to find me an emergency dentist.Only slight gripe was having to pay C$10.95/day for WiFi access: I would expect this to be free in this class of hotel."
37,1526,"Jul 18 2008	Reasonably priced in a good location	Our room was on the 16th floor at the back of the hotel with a fantastic view over the city (especially magical when we returned at night). We had booked a classic room for our 2 night stay but it was really spacious. We opened a set of double doors expecting it to be another wardrobe and to our delight discovered a kitchenette with coffee/tea maker, microwave, fridge, sink and cupboard space - ideal if you wanted to eat a meal in the room. There was a small table and chairs by the window which made it more comfortable. We only made use of this facility once (for breakfast) but it was useful to have. N.B. You have to ask on Reception for cutlery. The staff were friendly and helpful when it came to providing city and metro maps. Although the location was near to shops and restaurants the rue du Fort itself was not at all noisy. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the Bonaventure metro station and a very short and reasonably priced taxi ride to the VIA rail station where we took the train to Quebec City."
38,1526,"Jun 3 2008 	Decent Stay	A small group of friends and I stayed at the Hotel Du Fort in Montreal over Memorial Day Weekend. Check in was smooth as the front desk clerk was very polite and quick with the check in process. My initial hopes of the hotel was extremely high as the lobby seemed to have a semi- luxurious feel to it as the hotel website portrays. Unfortunately, upon checking into my room my expectations of a luxurious stay were let down somewhat. The room which I believe was the next in line upgrade over a standard room was large enough in design and very clean, but lacked any luxury features I expected from what the hotel website photos portrayed. My biggest let down was there was only one picture on the wall and a 80s type feel to the dcor and wall paper. Fortunately, after the initial let down the rest of the stay was pleasant. The hotel staff always smiled when walking by the front desk or passing in hall , and always asked if there was anything they could do for me or my friends. As for room comfort the beds were comfortable and the AC worked great. The bathroom was large enough and the shower although a bit dated was very clean and worked well. The location of the hotel could not be better as we were close to all the nightlife and restaurants of Rue Crescent and short cab ride away from Rue St-Laurent. Overall if you do not expect luxury standards and value cleanliness location and friendly employees you will enjoy your stay at Hotel DuFort."
39,1526,"May 22 2008 	Front Desk Staff are the Greatest!	From we arrived at the hotel, we were made to feel welcome and special by the front desk staff. During our stay, the front desk staff were always relaxed, accommodating and friendly. As I was not familiar with Montreal, they gave us good tips on where to go, where to eat, where to shop, etc. Kathleen and I particularly enjoyed the buffet breakfast as I am a picky eater. The room was huge and the bathroom clean and of the average size so it seems smaller by comparison with the huge room."
40,1526,"Apr 28 2008 	Thoroughly Enjoable Stay	To celebrate my wife's birthday, we decided to plan a weekend trip to Montreal, and booked our stay at the Hotel du Fort.This was our first stay at this particular hotel and we were most happy with our choice. The staff from the Front Desk person to the housekeepers we met each morning in the hallways, were always quick with a warm smile and a hello, and made us feel very welcomed. Our room, while not the largest we've stayed in was clean, modern, and well equipped.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel du Fort and would not hesitate to recommend this particular inn to other travellers."
41,1526,"Feb 24 2008 	Great Staff - Good Enough Stay	The concierge staff were very friendly and helpful &amp; the room was your average hotel room. We had some problems with the plumbing &amp; were not impressed that our room was entered without permission to deal with it. We didn't realize there was a problem yet. We had stepped out for lunch &amp; were surprised to see the lights shut off &amp; a note waiting to advice us of the entry. I had let me guard down &amp; left a lot of cash on the table. None of it was taken, it just left me a little uncomfortable.If I had to do it again, I'd consider the hotel because the rate is reasonable, but I might book a different hotel to be a few blocks further down St.Catherines.Otherwise, I don't see much wrong with this place."
42,1526,"Jan 6 2008	Hotel du Fort Satisfaction overrides Jazz Fest Dissappointment...	Hotel Du Fort get-a-way has become an annual tradition for myself, my husband, my brother and his wife. Last year's get-a-way included the Jazz Festival in early July. The Festival turned out to be more Hype than Jazz, disapppointing to the most dedicated attendees. But we counted on the usual expected hospitality of the Hotel du Forte to return to each day, and wake up to each morning. The restaurant served a full Breakfast Buffet, each morning, not stale muffins and hard bagels, but fresh fruit, fresh baked goods, an array of breakfast foods, including exceptional toasted granola, yogurt and more. Tables were set with cloth napkins, tablecloths, and a smiling waiter or waittress to pick up empty dishes, and greet each of us good morning, and pour coffee. I must add that since our reserved room was not ready upon our arrival, we were graciously awarded an upgrade to an exceptionally spacious suite ...which enhanced our stay immeasurably. Overall, I always enjoy our stay at this hotel, especially since the 4-star accommodations are very reasonable, if you don't mind a brief &quot;colorful&quot; walk to the downtown area, or a short bus ride to the Old Town Montreal cafes, Cathedrals, etc. The advantage is that you can park your vehicle in the attached garage upon arrival, and not get into it again until you leave Montreal. Did I also mention for cyberspace junkies there is a Cyber cafe directly across the street, open 24 hours daily? Oh, yes, and a fully stocked local market at the corner, just in case you need something after the restaurant is closed. Hotel du Fort has become a wonderful family tradition!"
43,1526,"Dec 2 2007 	A great find just a bit out of the way	A great hotel with efficient service and reasonable rates. I loved the spacious rooms, well thought of touches like wine glasses, dishes and utensils and an extra half bath in the premium king suite. Overall it was a great experience in a very clean room providing everything one could want in a not luxury, but close to luxury hotel. The room was a tad bland and there was not alot of character in the decor, but it is Montreal and everything we were there to enjoy was not in the hotel room. A wonderful city that I will continue to visit every year for the best shopping, dining and fun (in the Village) that can be had in Canada."
44,1526,"Nov 26 2007 	Perfect for what we needed at the very last minute	My husband received 4 tix to the Habs/Sabres game on Friday night, for Saturday's game at Bel Centre Club Desjardins. They were awesome tickets.So, we packed up the kids and went.Got to greater Montreal, out by P.E. Trudeau airport, and started looking at our GPS lodging listings. Hotel du Fort came up, I looked at the listing on Tripadvisor, saw it was #17 of over 100 hotels in the area, bang, we chose it.The front desk was helpful with recommendations about taxis vs metro vs walking, bang-on accurate every time. We had breakfast and parking included, which was terrific. Even the parking garage was warm.The room was spacious and clean. Comfortable, they put us on the 17th floor with a great view. The only thing missing was a pool, but honestly, we didn't have the time to go for a swim. I asked for extra pillows and they were at my door within 5 minutes; this at 10:00pm on Saturday night, delivered with a bright smile.Breakfast was quite good. No hot items on the buffet, but that was okay; the balance of it was very tasty, the breads were terrific. Hard boiled eggs were a hit with my kids. The children were made very welcome, which was nice, but it wasn't a Disney-esque experience. I'd have been perfectly happy to go there on a quick romantic getaway with hubby.All in all we were very happy to have chosen it, and I would recommend it without concern."
45,1526,"Nov 16 2007 	Great location	Stayed for 3 nights. Great location. Grocery store across the street, metro (subway) 3 blocks away, shopping on St. Catherines street around the corner. What more could you ask. The room had a queen size bed, lots of space, kitchenette with included fridge, microwave and coffee maker. You can get cutlery from the front desk or go the the Dollarama on St Catrherines St and get plastic dishes and cutlery (which we did) The gym had the basic cardio machines. Went early and it was busy. Great way to work off the french pastries. Would highly recommend this hotel."
46,1526,"Oct 22 2007 	Just what I expected	My fiance and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was just as everyone said in their reviews. The room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was clean and bright. We weren't given a voucher for breakfast so we did pay the $10/person charge but it was still good. Your basic: bagels, muffins, cereals, croissants and cheese. I personally think the location was great. It's right on St. Catherine where all the shops are. We basically hung out on Crescent (about 6 blocks) all weekend - we are in our late 20's. Parking was $17 a day but I felt that it was secure there. I would recommend this hotel."
47,1526,"Oct 19 2007 	Excellent hotel	My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Du Fort for 3 days.It was a little awkward to get to by car, but thanks to GPS, we had an easier time. Once you enter the hotel, you quickly appreciate a well run hotel employing very capable staff. We were able to dump off our luggage and return the rental car with little difficulty.The room itself was very nice, quiet, and included a fridge and microwave. It was well maintained. The front desk staff was very helpful with directions to the metro, and recommendations for restaurants, all nearby, which were excellent (Alpenhaus, Le Paris and Au Bistro Gourmet).There are all sorts of cafes, drug stores, and grocery stores nearby.We had a great stay at Hotel Du Fort and the quality of the accommodation was a major factor."
48,1526,Oct 14 2007 	Lovely Hotel and Staff	Charming boutique style hotel one block off one of the major streets filled with super shopping and wonderful restaurants. My husband and I even walked to Old Montreal and back to the hotel without any problem. The hotel staff is extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is spacious and clean and very quiet. My only recommendation is to bring your own haridryer. They do provide one but it is in an inconvenient place. Other than that the hotel is perfect.
49,1526,Sep 28 2007	Five Star Hotel for a Three Star Price	We had a fabulous stay at the Hotel du Fort. The front desk staff welcomed our family and made us feel at home and the service staff was wonderful. The room was very spacious and spotless with all the amenities. The hotel is situated on a quiet street. The free internet access on the second floor was a bonus for our daughters. Great meals were to be had within easy walking distance of the hotel. An easy walk down St Catherines for lots of great shopping. We would definately stay here again.
50,1526,Sep 17 2007 	Sweet Suite Deal	After Best Western Europa failed to honor their price online we booked a suite using Tourisme Montreal [--] for $145 plus tax. The hotel is right on St Catherine and just Blocks away from the Bell Centre and Crescent St dining. The Metro is a 2 blocks away in the other direction so a car is not needed. Hotel rooms are on the 10th floor and up with offices in between. Our room had a great view south to the river. Parking is extra ($17) as is the continental breakfast ($10). There is a gym but we only stayed one night so did not try it. Ther is no restaurant in the hotel but room service will bring food from local restaurants if desired. The suite was large and comfortable with a fridge microwave and coffee maker and a sofa bed suitable for children to sleep on. We have spent much more for a room with much less in Downtown Montreal Great deal for the price.
51,1526,"Sep 11 2007 	Staff made things right	My wife and I stayed here as a base to run in the Montreal Marathon. Upon arrival I was told that the room type I reserved (I had the confirmation in hand) was no longer available. I could settle for a smaller bed or a smoking room. I pointed out that it was 40 minutes after the listed check in time and doubted that everyone else had checked in before me. I insisted on the room type I reserved or a refund to the price of the lesser room.I was provided my parking voucher (included in the price of the room I booked) and asked to check at the desk once I parked my car. The desk clerk apologized for the inconvenience and provided me with a key to a, no additional cost upgrade, suite.The hotel isn't fancy but it is quiet, CLEAN and had a very friendly staff. They made their error right and offered an apology. We found the walk to Crescent Street to be easy and refreshing. No worries about safety and had the weather turned bad the metro was only a block and a half.Overall this was a pleasant experience and I would definitely stay here again."
52,1526,"Sep 11 2007 	Large room good location good price	Stayed 3 nights at this hotel.Room was large, comfortable and clean with a killer downtown view. Room was a bit dated and was surprised hotel was only 15 years old.Location was good with plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars nearby. Would recommend L'Paris on Catherine and for cheap eat of rosterrie chicken would recommend Scores further along.To get to Old Town was a 40 min walk and to walking along Catherine (beside the hotel) for 15 mins will bring you to start of shopping area. Latin Quarter is 30-35 min walk. Overall a good stay and would recommend. Montreal is a great city, very lively. Best city in Canada imo."
53,1526,"Sep 7 2007 	tidy but not fancy	I stayed at the last 2 weekends of August. It is clean and tidy but not elegant. The facilities are minimal. Actually, it is at the upper floors of a hotel/school complex. It locates at the west end of the busy district. Subway to go downtown is close by but you need to good through a tunnel (which is slightly smelly and somebody sleeps there at night). Taxi to go downtown is around $10.If you choose the signature room, it is pretty spacious with a queen and sofa beds almost at the same price. Some rooms have a pretty good view of downtown. If you book through AAA/CAA, it costs you a premium but includes parking and breakfast. Depending on the number of occupants, it may worth it.You need to register in the hotel before you can go to the building parking. However, there is no parking space in front of the hotel."
54,1526,"Sep 3 2007 	Decent price decent room	We stayed for 3 nights at Hotel Du Fort and had an okay time. We were using the hotel as a launching point for day trips throughout Montreal, but there didn't seem to be much going on near the hotel. It was very expensive overnight parking, and we should have included that in our hotel price.The hotel was very clean and comfortable, but also very outdated in furnishings. The room decor was clearly worn, but again very clean. A desk station, coffeetable and 2 chairs plus a mirror vanity in addition to the bed and bathroom. Pretty spacious, just not what we were expecting."
55,1526,"Aug 30 2007	Great Stay good price	My family and I booked this last minute. The hotel is downtown, but a little far from the hustle and bustle of the main St. Catherines area. It's about a 15 minuite walk. Too far though to walk to Vieux Montreal ( but most downtown hotels are). Unfortunately the metro was closed because of repairs so we had to use the Georges Vanier station vs. Atwater or Guy. Which turned out to be more convenient going to Old Montreal. The hotel itself isn't spectacular but nothing bad at all, except it doesn't have a restaurant but has a breakfast and lounge area. The service was good, housekeeping was a little slow.There is a good Persian restaurant two blocks east on St. Catherines across from the drug mart. There is also a small shopping centre at the corner of Atwater and St. Catherines ( about 2 blocks west of the hotel.) As well there is a nice small area a 10, 15 min. walk west on St. Catherines past Atwater, north on Greene.( in westmount). If you walk south on rue du Fort and across from the Canadian Center for Architecture there is a sculpture park with a nice view of south Montreal. Lastly, before booking your hotel room with any online site like expedia, call the hotel and ask the price for a room, it may turn out to be cheaper, ask if you can get breakfast or parking for free. Remember to be careful the area ( as most of downtown Montreal) can get slightly rough."
56,1526,"Aug 20 2007 	Pleasant for the price	My friend and I stayed at the Hotel du Fort for 4 nights during the week (Tues-Friday). For the price (the AAA rate - which included parking AND breakfast) it was well worth the stay. The room was clean, the hotel is in a decent location, and every single person on the staff was friendly.Never having traveled to Montreal, it was a shot in the dark...but an excellent choice! It's only a few short blocks from Cresent St. which has many restaurants to choose from. There are also many places to eat on St. Catherine so one never goes hungry! It's also only a few blocks from the subway. It seems to be a more business oriented hotel so we found it nice and quiet at night and not terribly busy. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others."
57,1526,"Aug 11 2007 	Classy gem in west section of downtown Montreal!	We arrived too early to check in but our luggage was kept safe by the helpful clerk in a locked room so we could enjoy our Montreal adventure right away. No sooner had I been waiting for our car to be parked by my traveling companion did the concierge strike up a conversation with me, inquiring about my hometown and then exchanging playful banter about our CFL teams. Sean was great and very knowledgeable - he had us hooked up with a tour departing from our hotel in just an hour's time, recommended restaurants for lunch and attractions in the area. After our tour we returned to the hotel and checked in properly. Our room on the 11th floor had a lovely view of downtown. It was a very generous size and was c lean and comfortable. The only downside was that we were located right in the middle of the corridor so that we could hear a lot of elevator traffic and more particularly, the ice machine going sometimes late at night. Otherwise, it was very quiet and the staff were wonderful. Everyone was fully bilingual so there were no problems with the staff not understanding English. Being located where it was, we had a quick and easy escape from the downtown towards Toronto on the morning of our departure as it is right up the street from a highway exit. It is also near to the Metro so we were able to catch a bus to the Oratory and the Metro down to Vieux Montreal on a $9 tourist STM pass. Well worth it to not have to worry about parking and driving in Montreal! I would definitely stay here again."
58,1526,"Aug 10 2007	Good Hotel	Stayed here for 3 nights with my 2 young children and husband. Our overall experience with the hotel was excellent. The staff were very pleasant and helpful and EVERYONE (including housekeeping) spoke English. The room, ours was a prestige suite, was spacious, clean and neutral and we had a lovely view. The kitchenette area had plates, etc. which was perfect to fix breakfast or a snack for the kids. I brought a couple bags of microwave pop corn which held them over before a later dinner. The only issue was the location. Yes, it is conveniant. You can walk to many places, but the neighbourhood is a little seedy. Also the parking lot is designed for small cars, so be careful if you go in a full sized SUV. The breakfast was well priced at a promo price of $10, but at the regular price, it isn't."
59,1526,"Aug 4 2007 	Not a restful stay	Yes, it is a nice hotel in the western fringe of downtown Montreal. The room is UNusually big but the bathroom is comparatively small with very little space to put toiletries on. As a whole it is nicely decorated and the complimentary breakfast was very good.What bothered me is that they put us up on the 10th floor next to the exercise room. At 7 o'clock in the morning, we were wakened by a thumping sound that continued unabated. We thought somebody broke the rule by using the exercise room too early. I went out to take a look and to my surprise, on the door the sign read &quot;opening hours 6:30am to 11:00pm&quot;. At the time of reservation I had specfied a quiet room. How can they put us up in such a room which is subject to noise in the early and late hours? I complained to the manager and no apology was given. All he said, &quot;They shouldn't have given you this room. Please do me a favour. Fill out a comment form as you check out&quot;. Obviously, tired and stressed out , the day in Montreal was somewhat spoiled as we headed to Quebec city that evening.We used the parking garage next door. It wasn't cheap, $17 a day. It annoyed me a great deal because the garage door opened a mere few seconds after inserting the parkcard. By the time I pulled the card out, put the car in gear to drive in, the door closed down on me. I had to try several times before I made it through. When exiting the garage, I didn't know I had to insert the parkcard in again and the door refused to open."
60,1526,"Jul 31 2007	A Nice Hotel	The parking garage was clean, safe, and very easily accesible from the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was large, clean, and comfortable with a nice view of the city and the Mont Royal. The hotel is very close to two metro stations so getting around is easy. It's also close to the highway so we didn't have to drive in downtown Montreal for very long. Skip the breakfast-we've had much better free continental breakfasts at the Hampton and Marriott. This breakfast isn't worth the money."
61,1526,"Jul 22 2007 	Great Hotel for the price	We stayed at Hotel Du Fort for three nights and found everything just wonderful. The staff was great, they were super friendly and went out of their way to be helpful.The room was extremely clean.Everyday we came back to a super clean room. The location was great, just a little walk from the main attractions but we liked it that way. Our room was on the 11th floor and it was exceptionally quiet.The microwave and refrigerator was great, it helped save us some money. The morming coffe and tea was a bonus. We didn't eat at the hotel so we can't comment on that. We will definitely stay here again. This is the first review I ever wrote but we liked it so much I'd like to pass the compliments along.We thought it was a great Hotel for the price."
62,1526,"Jul 2 2007 	Absolutely lovely	I stayed at the Hotel du Fort for a weekend break during a business trip to Southern Ontario in October 2006.What a little gem of a hotel! Staff were wonderful during my very late check-in, dealing with me very professionally, while at the same time gently chasing away a rather inebriated young woman who had followed a young man back to the hotel....*grin*The room was wonderfully comfortable, and the tiny kitchenette was perfect for some snacks &amp; bevs picked up at the nearby Provigo.The continental breakfast included in my room rate was excellent, but would not have been worth the quoted price. The little raisin rolls were very good though, so maybe....Staff were professional and attentive, and happily switched between French and English without hesitation (great for this unfortunately unilingual western Canadian).I'd happily stay there again, and in fact, hope to sneak away from another business trip this fall for a weekend in Montreal at the Hotel du Fort!"
63,1526,"Jul 1 2007 	Nice price and location	The Hotel du Fort has a nice location in downtown Montreal. The hotel is clean, well-staffed, and overall a solid choice in the area. The rooms were nice and modern but felt like a hotel. Although there are no real bells and whistles at this hotel, I really appreciated that - it allowed my husband and I to use it as a hotel and get out and explore the city. A tip: Definitely check the hotel's website - I found a much better price there than at the travel websites (e.g., Orbitz)."
64,1526,"Jun 18 2007	Excellent Service	I was very impressed during my stay at Hotel du Fort - the staff were extremely professional, helpful and very friendly. The rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious. The location is very convenient - near the metro, grocery stores....The staff were awesome, and calls and requests to the front desk were answered promptly and quickly (ie requesting cutlery). The rooms have a kitchenette which is really handy to have. There are some great features like a large screen TV in the common area where breakfast is served, as well as a couch and a library. The continental breakfast was quite decent as well. For a picky traveller, must say that I was very pleased with my stay at Hotel du Fort - I felt so well taken care of, I almost didn't want to go home! I would highly recommend Hotel du Fort to anyone looking for a place to stay in downtown Montreal."
65,1526,"Jun 16 2007 	Would be a great hotel at twice the price	Even after reading the positive reviews, the Hotel Du Fort exceeded my expectations. This hotel is a find - great location, spacious and nicely done rooms, good breakfast, and professional, friendly, accommodating staff - all at more than reasonable rates.The only strange thing was that, with the way the room was set up, you couldn't watch the TV from the sitting area, only from the bed. Not a big deal.I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to anyone."
66,1526,"May 29 2007 	Nice hotel in a great location	We stayed at Hotel Du Fort from 5/25 - 527. We had a large, clean, corner room on the 12th floor. It had a kitchenette, a sitting area, and a king size bed. Since it was a corner it had 3 large windows on two sides. It was a non-smoking room but someone definitley smoked in there at some point. Musty smoke odor but not that bad. Location is great! It is right on St Catherine St so it is never far to a bar or restuarant. Cresent St is only about 4-5 blocks away. The hotel staff is very nice and helpful! Parking is expensive at about $17 a day Canadian"
67,1526,"May 21 2007	A great find in Montreal	Only able to stay in Montreal one night, we considered ourselves so lucky to have booked the Hotel du Fort. The hotel and its employees exceeded our expectations. We had a huge, clean, corner room with fantastic views. The genial, helpful staff helped us take advantage of the hotel's great location,"
68,1526,"Apr 23 2007 	Great deal great stay great hotel!!	We booked a room with king size bed and when we got there, they bumped us to an executive suite for only and extra $20! Suite had 2 rooms, with private hallway, kitchenette (with small fridge, plates, glasses, etc. all spotless). Had plama tv and couch in one room and another tv in the other (although couldn't figure out how to turn it on...but we could have called). Bed sheets spotless and great reallyyy comfortable bed. Bathroom clean too! Great size room...all for about $120 US dollars. Parking in underground safe garage, cost about $17 Canadian dollars. Concierge helpful and friendly! Near Catherine Street and about 5 minute drive from Old Montreal. Would definitely go again."
69,1526,"Apr 11 2007 	Would certainly stay again	Very Comfortable room.. not really modern. Right downtown, close to everything (shopping, Movie Theatre &amp; Bell Centre)Convenient underground safe parking"
70,1526,"Mar 26 2007 	An affordable oasis in the city!	We decided to stay at the Hotel Du Fort after many positive reviews here on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed! It is located on Saint Catherine St. which is the main downtown drag. You have access to a multitude of grocery stores and restaurants all within walking distance. If you plan on taking the Metro (which we recommend) instead of driving, you are located between Atwater and Guy-Concordia station. Each are about a 5-10 min walk away.The staff was very professional and we were even able to check in early. The front desk staff and concierge gave us a lot of great info about restaurants and must-see's in Montreal. On departure, they stored our luggage and called us a taxi ahead of time so we would not have to wait. The rooms are spacious and very clean with a small kitchentte and fridge. The beds were very comfortable and we did not have one complaint about our room. Overall, it was a wonderful experience that we would gladly repeat. If you're looking for clean, comfortable accomodations located in downtown Montreal that is reasonably priced, do not hesitate to stay here!"
71,1526,"Mar 19 2007 	Amazing	This place was a great place to stay! My boyfriend and I went to Montreal for our first time and stayed at Hotel du Fort. From the first moment we got there until we left we didn't have a single issue. We arrived earlier than our room was ready so the concierge stored our luggage while we walked around Rue Ste. Catherine. The hotel was in the perfect spot and we had a nice view of Downtown Montreal. The metro was a 5-10 minute walk on a very cold day. We walked to the Atwater station, though Guy Concordia is close as well. Every single staff member was nice and helpful. There was one concierge, I wish I knew his name, that helped us find the best night spots, restaurants and happenings around the city. The rooms were lovely and comfortable. Given the chance, I will stay in Hotel du Fort the next trip I make to Montreal. I won't go anywhere else."
72,1526,"Mar 14 2007 	Surprised By All the Glowing Reviews	Having read many glowing reviews about Hotel du Fort, I was feeling pretty good about my stay. The hotel was just OK.Pros:Close to the Guy-Concordia stop on the MetroStones throw from Rue Ste. CatherineSupermarket (Provigo) across the street and another market 1/2 block awayPrice ($63 USD/night through Expedia)Cons:The room (drab, tired, musty smell, dusty)Apparently this hotel is popular with tour groups that cater to teens and 20-somethings. It felt like I was the only person on my floor not affiliated with this particular group. The floor sounded like a college dorm, even at 3:00 AM. One of the staff was telling me that this particular group was one of the better ones. Yikes!"
73,1526,"Mar 5 2007 	Hotel Du Fort was toatlly worth it	Hotel Du Fort was great, it was very centrally located and 2 blocks from the train station and around the corner from Rue ste catherine which has bars, clubs, restaurants, everything. Taxi's are easily accessible and the hotel staff are super helpful with directions, calling taxis and general information."
74,1526,"Feb 13 2007	Amazing!!!	I found this Hotel by complate chance. As soon as I visited their website I was hooked! Being a frist time solo traveler (i am only 18..) I was nervous at how the hotel staff was going to respind to me and my boyfriend, and our 3 guy friends staying there. The second that we stepped out of the cabs the staff was so helpful. Eveytime we walked through the lobby the Concierge were always there to point us in the right direction. We only experianced one problem. For the first night we were put in the wrong room. But as soon as I relized the mistake, the staff took care of it, and we were in out new room very quickly.Overall I would recomend this Hotel to anyone. It is in an ideal spot for tourists, just a few blocks away from shopping, bars, and clubs. And only a short cab ride away from old Montreal!"
75,1526,"Oct 11 2006 	Great hotel great staff great location	I have just returned from a weekend (holiday) at the Hotel Du Fort. The hotel is great and has such good service. We stayed on the 11th floor with its own ice and pop machines and one floor above the gym and snack machine. I wasn't sure just what to expect at breakfast, but it was a lovely continental spread with cheeses, pastries etc. The staff were very knowledgeable and gave great dinner suggestions. They also had maps and the official tourist guide for Montreal, all of which was very helpful in planning the day. Check out was at 12noon, but had a cab come to meet us at the hotel at 1:00 as we had to be at the airport for 1:45pm. They stored our baggage for us while we walked along St. Catherines St. one last time before going home. All in all, the Du Fort is great, and I would not hesitate to stay there again."
76,1526,"Sep 28 2006	great location	We stayed at the Hotel du Fort for 4 nights in September 2006 and had a great time. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and what I liked the most was to have my own make-up mirror. We were on the 18th floor, therefore the view was absolutely wonderful at night. The kitchenette is small but cozy. The room is a good size. My only complaint would be that the bed is a bit to hard for my liking. The location is great because youre close to the boutiques and restaurants. I would definitely stay there again."
77,1526,"Sep 26 2006 	Hotel Du Fort---GREAT PLACE TO STAY :)	Just got back from staying at the Hotel Du Fort. WE HAD THE BEST TIME. The hotel was clean--hotel staff very nice. We are going to make this a yearly trip now. The location couldn't be better. It is located in the middle of 3 metros--all within a few blocks. You can be in Old Montreal via metro in @10 minutes at the most. We used the metros every day....traveled everywhere in Montreal...saw everything...and had a great time. Eat late --this is the city that never sleeps...seriously! If you love beer and food....Montreal is the place to go. Also, visit the Cock N Bull Pub--local bands play on Thursday and Friday nights--located on St. Catherine. Best place to eat is Cine Express --about 1/2 block on St. Catherine. Grocery store has everything you will need for breakfast, etc.... However Cine Express is very cheap....huge portions and great food...serves breakfast--stays open until @2:00 am.Can't wait to go back. Have fun--we did :)"
78,1526,"Sep 23 2006 	Du Fort a comfortable and convenient hotel	My wife and I had a delightful stay here for 5 nights in early September. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful with directions, reservations, and booking tours. Parking is underneath hotel (separate charge of $15 or so per night). Expect to carry your own bags; carts are available. The room was $135C per night plus 14% taxes. Our room was clean, quiet, and comfortable, with the bathroom and closet a little on the small side. Flat screen TV was in good working order with the usual selection of recent pay per view films ($12.99C). There is no restaurant but a buffet breakfast is available each morning. We passed on this since our room had a mini-kitchen with microwave, sink, coffeemaker, and dishes and silverware. There is a well-stocked grocery store almost across the street. Also, there is a newstand and a breakfast/lunch place in the building that is not a part of the hotel. Location is great on the west side of town just off one of the main east/west streets (St. Catherine). Restaurants (bistros, Iranian, Japanese, etc.), groceries, post office, stores, a movie megaplex are all within easy walking distance (less than 2 blocks). There are a lot of colleges and technical schools in the area so there are lots of students thronging the streets. The retail is mixed (not the high end) but neighborhood is very safe to walk around in during the day or evening. Metro (green line) is about 3 blocks in either direction. Would we stay there again/recommend to others? Definitely, yes."
79,1526,Jul 15 2006	Good Accomo for a family	Not a bad place to stay.Good: NIce sized room. Quiet. Friendly staffBad: At the far western edge of the downtown district. Needs a bit of updating.
80,1526,"Jul 14 2006	Loved It!	I booked this hotel through their website after checking Tripadvisor (of course). They offered a AAA rate of $149 CA which included parking ($16/per day) and continental breakfast ($13.00). What a pleasant surprise! The hotel was clean, the room large and had a small compact kitchen which came in handy for dinner leftovers. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Location was great - we parked the car in the hotel lot and never moved it. The Atwater Metro was a few blocks in one direction and the Guy-Concordia Metro a few blocks in another direction. The hotel is half a block from St. Catherine's Street - the main drag through Montreal. We walked or took Metro everywhere we wanted to go with no problems whatsoever. Many ethnic restaurants and cafes well within walking distance. At no time did we feel threatened walking the streets, no matter what time it was. I would definitely stay here again."
81,1526,"Jul 10 2006	Spacious rooms good deal	First, a word of caution. If you happen to be arriving on Canada Day (July 1), note that Montreal's Canada Day parade starts on du Fort street. You may be delayed in driving/parking until later in the afternoon. No worries though, as the rest of our stay was excellent. Very large, spacious rooms. The appointments in the room were above average, if not unspectacular. Nice flat screen tvs. Small lobby, helpful staff. Well within walking distance of Metro stops and many downtown spots."
82,1526,"May 1 2006	off the beaten track good value	My family of two adults and two teens booked this hotel through their website. We arrived after 5 pm. I was pleasantly surprised. Clean and very quiet, in an urban neighborhood. Not a tourist area. The breakfast at the du Fort was too expensive for four. Convenient - Post office, grocery stores, and internet cafe across the street. Little fridge and microwave in the room. Walk to transportation, walk to car rental, shops and restaurants. We really liked the ethnic dining options nearby. I found the desk staff very helpful in contrast to some other reviewers. Always call to re-confirm and get the manager's name."
83,1526,"Apr 14 2006 	Budget not Boutique	I travel to Montreal regularly on business and thought I would give it a try since they were offering pretty reasonable rates. This is a hotel catering to the budget tourist or anyone else looking for an inexpensive stay downtown.Pro'sReasonable rates Spacious and well equipped rooms with safe, windows you can open and a kitchenetteCon'sOdd-ball location in Concordia University ghettoOnly two elevatorsInsufficient and indifferent staffBland room designsSmall bathroomsNot particularly cleanSimilar hotels in the downtown include the Marriott Residence,Le Cantile Suites and the Phillips Square. Of these the Phillips Square gets my vote."
84,1526,"Jan 8 2006	Excellent Hotel	I originally stayed at the Hotel Du Fort in Montreal about 10 years ago, yet my recollection of the quality of the hotel was vague. For whatever reason, I decided to stay there on our most recent trip to Montreal, just to try something new ... and I was blown away with the curteous staff, the quality of the room, the overall cleanliness of the lobby and our room and, most of all, the value for our money ( ie. $135 per night in the heart of downtown Montreal). The location is ideal ... park your car and leave it ... everything is accessible either by foot, inexpensive taxi, or subway ...Every aspect of our stay at Hotel Du Fort was positive ... I've now switched allegiances from my former &quot;regular&quot; hotel accommodations in Montreal."
85,1526,"Dec 28 2005	Great location!	Don't let the austere and rather bland facade fool you; this is an understated but elegant hotel located right downtown.You would never guess this hotel used to be an office building - there is much warmth and charm offered in the cozy, attractive and exceptionallty clean rooms that offer great views of the cityMy husband and I stayed here recently, and I really loved this hotel not only for its ambience, but for its GREAT DOWNTOWN LOCATION. Not only are you just a few blocks away from the metro (subway), but you are also within walking distance to several excellent restaurants that offer a variety of cuisine from Thai, to Italian, to Indian, Schezwan, Mexican, French.. and so much more.Most rooms are equipped with a small kitchenette (mini-fridge and microwave), and although breakfast is included in the guest lounge (2nd floor), there is a very excellent grocery store (Provigo) located just around the corner from the hotel (on Ste Catherine St.) which is open until 2:00AM. On the opposite corner is a major post office (so convenient for mailing those postcards and gifts to the folks back home!) - and if you are travelling with a laptop, high-speed internet access is only $9.95Cdn for 24hr access. Left your laptop at home? Not to worry, because there is an internet cafe right across the street from the hotel!! (it is called &quot;Battle.Net&quot; if I remember correctly).Unique Qualities:There is no pool, but the hotel has recently added a small gym and excercise room, but I haven't had to opportunity to check it out. They also have excellent conference facilities and a small buffet breakfast lounge area. The buffet breakfast is nothing fancy - your typical juices, fresh fruit, cereals (hot and cold), croissants, bagels, toast, muffins, tea and coffee. The croissants are outstanding. And all layed out in a very attractive and quiet setting. The wide screen TV is set to CNN and local news, but it is set back in a corner of the room and not so blaringly loud as to disturb those who enjoy a quiet breakfast. Newspapers (both local and the New York Times) are complimentary also.The views of the Montreal skyline at night, and the mighty Saint Lawrence river in the background are well worth the rates alone.Speaking of rates, they are fairly reasonable compared to the other downtown hotels in the area. We paid $125.00 Cdn a night/per room during a weekend stay (March 2003) in a standard room, breakfast included.My only complaint about this hotel is the rather plain bathrooms, with standard size bathtubs. They're Ok I guess - pretty much what you'd expect of any standard hotel bathroom - but I love a good soak at the end of the day in a big whirlpool/jacuzzi type bathtub, and it's a shame more hotels don't offer this feature.Still, in my opinion - definately worth the money in comparison to other hotels in this area.Hotel web site: www.hoteldufort.com/"
86,1526,"Nov 21 2005	Won't go back	When we arrived, we were told that our room wasn't available, as the previous people had not vacated it. When we explained we had a reservation that we had made several months previously (it was our honeymoon), we were told there was nothing that they could do. We stood and argued for approximately 30 minutes, and finally were given a room. Horrible experience. The room was nice enough, but I wouldn't risk getting told they wouldn't honour our reservation again. We won't go back."
87,1526,"Oct 23 2005	Great value.	This hotel is a great value. My wife and I spent there to nights, the room was very big and very clan. The bathroom was huge and the room had an impressive view over Montreal downtown."
