179,1912,"Jan 27 2009 	not the best	we arived late to this hotel room and told the concierge that would be the case, the room was not had heating on and with -8c outside it was very difficult to sleep.2nd day we had been out all day in the city, but when we had returned the room had not been made up.not a great start for this type of hotel.service was not very personel and found it better to suited to buisness traveller"
180,1912,"Jan 23 2009	18"" of closet space?? that stunned us more than the view!	Count us in among the minority of TripAdvisors who will not be returning to this Sofitel. Our suite on the top floor (29th story) was indeed well-insulated against noise, had a great view, and we appreciated the fact that the windows have both sheer and black-out draperies. The large, full marble bathroom is nicely fitted out with deep tub, separate, walk-in shower, toiletries that are not heavily perfumed -- and an orchid in a vase and a candle. Large, flat screen TV's in both the living room &amp; bedroom with a Bose clock radio in the BR. And the 2 little bottles of Evian left at evening turn-down were a nice touch, even though a bit of chocolate would be nicer :-)Willing to overlook the couple of smallish stains on the rug and the fact that the shower handle fell off and struck my foot; these things happen. But, the furnishings/layout -- apart from the bed -- were not that comfortable (some might find the bed too soft). Most surprising, the lone closet had a rod just 24&quot; wide and part of that was rendered unusable by the closet's caddies for ironing board and iron, leaving less than 18&quot; -- and thus relegating us to leaving our coats draped elsewhere and being able to hang only a few garments. There were shelves, but several of those were taken up by the folded bathrobes (no peg for those in the bathroom), a blanket but not the synthetic pillows promised by the in-room info booklet for those allergic to down &amp; a wicker basket with the laundry bags tucked inside. The only drawer space were the 2 narrow ones in the bedside tables. Consequently, we had to leave most of our belongings packed in our luggage, which had to sit out as there was no place to stow our couple of standard carry-on pieces. From reading other reviews here that speak glowingly of the closet space, it appears that the rooms/suites are not configured alike; if you are not traveling solo, check out what's given you &amp; ask if another room/suite is available if you too find yourselves facing hanging rod &quot;real estate&quot; costing ~$30/inch. The beds have no top sheet, but rather are covered with simply a luxurious down-filled duvet. Even if you're not squeamish about this -- and I'll assume they change the duvet cover between guests -- it can be uncomfortably warm. So, highly recommend that you ask housekeeping to make up the bed with a sheet &amp; ordinary blanket before you retire.Lastly, utterly indifferent service all-around... not that I expect, or want, to be fawned over, but geez, it would be nice to feel that you're not part of the furniture. In short, an oddly bland &amp; even irritating hotel experience we're not eager to revisit."
181,1912,"Jan 19 2009 	Awesome experience!	We booked a king lux room for an anniversary getaway weekend.The entire staff at the hotel was wonderful. Once we got to our room on the 29th floor we learned they upgraded us to a suite! It was amazing! The view was spectacular and the room amenities were 5 star. The king bed was the most comfortable we have ever found at a hotel. We needed the housekeeping staff to de-feathered some of the bed linens (due to my asthma) and they could not have been nicer. This was the weekend of my dreams and of all of the wonderful hotels we have stayed in NewYork over the years the Sofitel is by far now my favorite. The convenience factor can't be overlooked as well. I had read reviews about The Red Flame diner down the street. It is very cozy and reasonable unlike the hotel's restaurant, Gaby's. Although the Sofitel is a bit pricey it is soooo worth it!"
182,1912,"Jan 18 2009 	Great hotel with spacious rooms	First trip to New York and had heard that, generally, NY hotel rooms were very small for the price you pay. Was recommended Sofitel by a friend as a more spacious option. We were not dissapointed. Plenty of room to move about and, more importantly, put all that shopping. The bathroom had seperate (good sized) bath and shower. The hotel and room were kept very clean and the staff were friendly and informative. I can't comment on the restaurant as we went out for all our meals. Overall for the price you pay I would definately recommend this hotel."
183,1912,"Jan 15 2009 	Great Great Hotel	Searching for a Hotel in NY...? Look no further, you have found it...We have just arrived from a 3 day stay in NY. Although it was not our first trip to NY I searched for a hotel at the trip advisor and, believe me this hotel worth is position there.It is more expensive then others you can find, but if you can afford it, you won't regret it.The Sofitel is very well located, just two blocks from Times square; the rooms are large, specially for NY, great bed, great bathroom, well soundproofed, modern furniture.The staff were all very efficient, polite, the check in and check out without any problem.The food at the restaurant was great and come out quickly.In Summary: A case where what you found is even better then what is showed in the pictures.In favour: almost everythingAgainst: A hotel like this should have free access internet in the rooms"
184,1912,"Jan 10 2009 	Sofitel NY is simply the best...	Yes; I am yet another Trip Advisor junkie who endlessly pursues the best hotels around the world, and by best I mean the most value for my hard earned s.To be honest I am still writing this from my Sofitel Suite on the 27th floor with only half the break complete. So unless there is an earthquake or the chef blows up the building I am already past my best expectations of this gem of a place.From the start, the whole experience of the Sofitel NY been fantastic, the warmth of the friendly staff and the ambiance of the whole place is quite fantastic in a chilly town. I booked this as a treat for my wifes 40th birthday and I could not be happier after all the concerns over getting it right. Cake was very much appreciated.I usually start reviewing hotels with the lowest ranking first and although I may sympathise with some of the folks and their comments I cannot believe that they came up with such inept reasons as to why their entire lives, and possibly that of their offspring, had been ruined by a doormen talking to people while the author manhandled his own luggage past him onto the trolley (I actually thought that one was funny), water supply issues and some guy thinking he is a Philadelphia lawyer by catching the Sofitel out because they took the time to write a letter of explanation on why he didnt get water. Someone even wrote about call charges to Argentina from his hotel room! The news is basically this people  if you are looking for perfection (the kinds that you obviously have in your own homes) then open your own hotels and dont forget to charge the earth for phone calls, room service, movies and everything else that discerning travellers KNOW ABOUT. Stay at the Sofitel NY and pay millions to call Argentina, spend another million on the mini bar, remortgage the house and get some room service, get angry at the maintenance man who cannot unblock a toilet in three seconds flat, and never forget that sometimes things just dont go to plan - especially when you didnt go direct and use so called cheap deal site to book your stay.Seasoned travellers and seasoned Trip Advisor surfers can easily read between the lines of the torch wielding vigilante and I can honestly say that had it not been for their comments I would not have been compelled nor bothered to write this review- backfired or what?PS  never ever class or benchmark a Manhattan hotel with any other 5 star around the globe as you will be disappointed. 5 star ratings died when Dubai hotels started rating themselves seven stars"
185,1912,"Jan 10 2009 	Out of this World!	I originally wrote a review for this hotel, when I came back in October 2008; but it never seemed to appear?! But I felt I had to write something.I arrived with my boyfriend for a 5 night stay and was given room 2221 with a view of the Chrysler Building since we were celebrating my birthday whilst in New York. A complimentary chocolate birthday cake was brought up on the day and it was a lovely touch.Rooms: Can't fault at all. Spacious, bed to die for and crisp, clean white linen. Bose surround system. Lovely turn down service at night. Nice range of French toiletries. Fresh Orchid in the Bathroom too.Service: Nice reception staff, cancelled a reservation on my behalf for me. Helpful and courteous. Polite doormen too. Room service was on time and the food was good. The price is what you would expect in a luxury city hotel.Location: Superb. Within walking distance of Times Square, Grand Central Terminal, 5th Avenue. Being in the location it was, I was never woken up with street noise at all.The lobby has free internet access on computers which is a good service, but can we quite busy at times.Overall, I can't fault this hotel. I still rave about it since I'm back and would definitely book again on my return to New York."
186,1912,Jan 8 2009 	Great hotel in the middle of the big Apple.	I stayed here for 5 nights. It is a great 4**** + hotel in the middle of Manhattan. Close to Broadway and 5th avenue. The hotel is clean and rooms are middle sized. The beds are great and the service is fine. Full HD screens in the room which is not common in Europe. Would stay here again. Booked thrue Orbitz but the rates direct at www.sofitel.com were better.
187,1912,"Jan 6 2009 	Fantastic service at a perfectly located hotel	We arrived on the 30th December to spend 5 nights at the sofitel. After a 7 hour delay we were tired but soon to be greated by really friendly door staff who looked after us immediately. We stayed in a suite on the 27th floor, and although the view was not great from our side of the hotel the room was clean, well decorated, a good size and and had all the facilities you would need. Throughout our stay the concierge were exceptional, we spoke to them before we got to New York to ask about booking a Broadway show and they were just brilliant - they could not have been more helpful. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for great service in a perfect location. The hotel is situated just next to Times Square and it is a great location for going either up or downtown. We are very picky on service and after reading some of the reviews were a little concerned, however these concerns were put to rest immediately."
188,1912,"Jan 6 2009 	Fantastic hotel!	We were thrilled with the Sofitel in New York. It was our third trip we have stayed in the Hilton, The Plaza (before the refurb) and this was the best! We booked it because we were going with another couple and wanted to keep the cost down and we found a good deal but it turned out to be an amazing hotel. The rooms are lovely - good size for NY - bathrooms gorgeous - all marble with separate bath and shower, the beds are the standard sofitel beds which are just amazing - they have a feather mattress topper and feather duvet and it feel like you're sleeping on a cloud!We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as we like the novelty of diners too much. Location is perfect - just close enough to Time Square and all the shops.I generally don't like chains - i hate the hilton style endless corridors and identikit rooms but this hotel had a small hotel feel. It has only a few rooms on each floor so you don't feel like you're in a huge hotel and both our rooms were a little different.Love it - will definitely be staying here next time we're in NY."
189,1912,"Jan 5 2009 	Wow - still an oasis of understated luxury	We stayed at this Sofitel between Thanksgiving and 1 December. We'd previously stayed here in 2002 and I am seriously impressed that the quality of both the accommodations and the service at this hotel has not noticably diminished with time. We arrived at around 2.30pm and our room was already available - we were upgraded to a suite on the 29th floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building and Bryant Park 1Check in was super friendly and welcoming - our stay could not have got off to a better start. The suite was just as I remembered- - clean, spacious, comfortable and very VERY quiet. We never heard another guest during our entire stay. Bathroom amenities include a power shower with fantastic water pressure, a soaking tub and other little touches including robes, huge fluffy towels, slippers and Roger &amp; Gallet Oatmeal toiletries(excellent for those with sensitive skin - not too perfumed). Room service was excellent as was the housekeeping - everything was replenished daily and extras always left. We had fresh flowers in our bedroom (orchids) and a single orchid in the bathroom. The turn down service left a box of chocolates and bottles of water every evening. We didn't use the hotel restaurant or bar as we were out and about a lot so I cannot comment on these facilities. There is a mini bar in the room and the prices weren't too outrageous by big city standards - however it would still be nice to have tea and coffee making facilities for first thing in the morning... On the day of our departure I asked for a late check-out which was granted &quot;with pleasure&quot; (I asked for 4.00pm - although we actually left at 3.00pm) There was a slight problem with my bill at check out but this was modified immediately with apologies from the staff. The concierge and the door men offered umbrellas and assistance when it rained and were able to call a cab to the airport without delay - great service and always with asmile. Overall I would categorise this hotel as understated luxury - quiet,efficient and charming. The Staff go out of their way to be both welcoming and helpful. Add to that the brilliant location and I don't think you can get a better deal in this city."
190,1912,"Jan 5 2009 	Tranquility in the middle of Manhattan at the Sofitel	We arrived at the Sofitel New York on Christmas Eve for our first trip to the city. I was pleasently suprised by the exterior, as websites show a new, tall. glass building, however the entrance is the original Edwardian facade, as are the lobby and reception area, all of which were beautifully decorated for Christmas. It is only after you exit from the lift that you realize you are in a new 'tower' building. Staff are very polite and accommodating but also very unobtrusive, which is just the way we like it. The concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful.The hotel has one bar and one restaurant, which we used on Christmas morning for breakfast, but having paid $51 for one continental breakfast and one bowl of oatmeal with fruit, plus coffee and juice we didnt go back! The Red Flame about 5 doors down is fantastic for a hearty New York breakfast, though you do somtimes have to wait for a seat, it is very popular.Our room was on the 29th (top floor) we had paid for an upgrade to a 'City view' room and said 'City view' was amazing, with an unbelivable view of the Chrysler building. The room was quite spacious, had a big HD flat screen TV ,internet access and Queen bed. The marble bathroom was very large with a fantastic shower cubicle bigger than most hotel bathrooms! Complimentary toiletries by Roger and Gallet where replaced every day, the hotel also operates a turn down service in which the staff turn on the 'Bose' sound system which is playing classical music on your return each evening! One small niggle (so small we didn't mention it to the hotel) is that there was quite a bit of noise from the lift shaft in our room (2920) it was something that became less important the more we walked the length and breadth of Manhattan, and became too tired to care! Apart from this the hotel is very well sound proofed from the noise outside and seemed very tranquil.The Sofitel is in a fantastic location only a stones throw from 5th Avenue, 5 minutes walk to Grand Central, 5 minutes to Bryant park, and 5-10 to the Rockafeller centre, less than 5 minues to the nearest subway. We will definitely use it again on our return, and can highly recommend it to others."
191,1912,"Jan 4 2009	Fabulous comfy beds!	Stayed at Sofitel over Thanksgiving 2008 with my sister for four nights. The reception area is very welcoming and the staff courteous and polite. We had a room on the 21st floor and had no problem with street noise at all. Views were good. The hotel is superbly situated very close walking distance to 5th Ave, Times Square with good restaurants, Grand Central Station (good breakfast venue opposite) and the Rockefellar centre. The bathroom was spacious and it was useful to have the separate bath and shower cubicle. Room service prices are quite high, so we used a local deli for snacks. Being truly British girls we couldn't do without our tea in the morning and I took a kettle and t bags with us, as the hotel don't provide these as complimentary. They provide bottled water each night at 'turndown'.The bar is great and we drank there on a couple of occassions arriving back worn out and desperate for a Bud. Best of all was the bed..the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in..like snuggling into a cozy nest, especially when you are so exhausted! Didn't eat in the hotel, as we felt it rather pricey. Found good breakfast locally (not the Red Flame Diner - thought it too tacky! - you can do better elsewhere).Thank you for previous reviews, I booked this hotel on the back of these, and I would recommend the Sofitel to anyone seeking a very central comfortable hotel. It may be more pricey than some others but the extra is worth every penny in terms of location and comfort, and we would stay there again, without hesitation."
192,1912,"Jan 3 2009 	Fantastic hotel !	My husband and I stayed here for a week over Christmas - we both loved the hotel. On arrival, we were greeted by friendly reception staff who informed us that we had been upgraded as it was my birthday! We had a lovely room on the 27th floor with an amazing view of the Crysler building. The room was perfect - gorgeous bathroom, comfortable bed and linen, flatscreen tv, safe, mini bar etc. It was serviced thoroughly everyday and we also had a turn down service in the evening. We did not eat in the restaurant, although had booked to on Christmas Day. However, we changed our minds when we saw the menu was not the one we were shown the day before. Gaby's is great for evening cocktails and yes, it is probably expensive, but we were on a holiday (and birthday treat) of a lifetime so didn't worry! I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I visited NYC. The only thing that bugged us a bit was that you could hear the lifts continually going up and down all the time from our room but this was a minor concern."
193,1912,"Jan 1 2009	Metti Made the Experience Unique	We recently stayed at the Sofitel for the fourth time for a five night break. All of the staff were excellent, in particular Metti. Metti made us feel at home from start to finish. As usual, the Sofitel is ideally located in the heart of everything to do in New York. We thoroughlly enjoyed our stay.Mary and Eddie"
194,1912,"Dec 30 2008 	Good Hotel in NYC	The Sofitel was a nice, clean hotel in NYC, but very pricey. Rooms are modern and clean with large bathrooms and nice TV's. We got a room on the 21st floor with a good view of the city. The bed and linens were very comfy. The lobby's not much to look at and seems worn. The best thing about the hotel is the location, 2 blocks from almost everything. Staff was friendly, although the concierge could have been a bit more helpful. Overall a good experience with no real complaints. The Red Flame restaurant right down the street is a good place for breakfast at a reasonable price. Would stay again if ever in NYC again."
195,1912,Dec 24 2008 	Average at Best	Just finished our weekend getaway at the Sofitel and it was average. Obiviously the room was small. We booked a luxury king room on the 16th floor. At night you can here the water running down from the upper floors everytime someone used the bathroom. The shower had a temperature lock on it so that you can't turn the water any hotter. There is only one sink with horrible water control. The view was terrible. The pillows were awful. The bed is comfortable. No one so far has mentioned that parking is $50.00 per night with a $45 fee for retrieving your car (in addition). The location is very good and close to most destinations. We did not eat at the hotel but we did eat at Mesa Grill (also average) and Koi (very good). We also saw Wicked (highly recommended).
196,1912,"Dec 24 2008 	5th Stay at the Sofitel	As a little background this will be my fifth consecutive stay at the Sofitel in New York City. For the past five years my wife and I have stayed at the hotel because of the location, charm, and service and quality of rooms. The first two years (reviews posted) the service was impeccable and without question the staff would ensure every request was met. Last year (2007) there was a noticeable decline in the hotel (rugs worn, walls slightly damaged) but I guess that is expected. The limo forgot to pick us up at the airport and I had to call 4-5 times to finally have a car pick us up. In all fairness this was not the hotels fault but the car company they were using at the time. Well, sadly this year will most likely be our last at the Sofitel. The service has further digressed and the rooms are starting to show their age. We had a problem with the air conditioner vent (rattling) that could not be resolved, someone was smoking cigars on the floor, and we were told the odor would go away in time. But here is the thing that will make me look at another hotel next year. On our second day of a four day stay we came back to the room after a day in the city to find the room had been somewhat cleaned, but the pillows had no pillow cases, no duvet and half the towels were missing. When I notified the front desk they thought I was joking. Sure enough after they checked they could not explain the oversights but said, they would try and get someone up to the room as soon as possible. Well, 30 minutes later housekeeping showed up and said, sorry I forgot. Are you kidding me? You forgot. Not to belabor this point, there has been a change at the Sofitel and I am not sure it is for the good. Is it still a good hotel, yes? Just not great anymore for the money you spend."
197,1912,"Dec 22 2008 	Best place I've stayed in NYC	I travel to NYC on business a few times a year. I've stayed at Hilton on Sixth, Sheraton, Plaza, Grand Hyatt, Waldorf, and Kitano. Sofitel, dollar for dollar, beats them all by a mile. Terrific location. Quiet and elegant lobby, if not a grand one in the classic tradition. Good-sized rooms, nicely appointed with quality furniture and touches, and generously-sized bathroom with great sink space and blasting shower. Flat screen TV, Bose radio, plenty of desk space, and very comfortable mattress and bedding. Service was very fine, from the doormen to the desk and restaurants. Pricey, pricey food, but what can you expect. Breakfast pastries alone almost worth the arm and leg for some eggs and juice. Small bar but friendly and skilled bartender, with little plate of munchies &quot;free&quot; with the drink (some sort of fancy cracker and olives). Gym has several machines, several aerobic machines, weights, balls, mats, towels, water -- not a ton of extra space, but not claustrophobic (unlike, say, the rooms in the LA Biltmore workout center). Paid around $375 /night for a business trip -- not for the faint of heart, but a fair price for what you get. My hotel of choice, by far, in NYC (or at least Midtown)."
198,1912,"Dec 18 2008	Great hotel great location!	We had originally booked for the Waldorf Astoria but having seen recent reviews changed to the Sofitel. We weren't disappointed. We arrived around midnight in a very cold New York but the welcome was very warm. We were shown to our room which was spacious, had a great bathroom with views onto the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings. We ate breakfast in the Red Flame Grill a few yards from the hotel as recommended by other reviewers and couldn't fault it. The hotel has a great location - just off 5th Avenue and great shopping and within a few minutes walk of Times Square and Grand Central Station. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we were given a 3pm checkout on our last day - just 15 minutes before we were due to be picked up for the airport. The bed was really comfortable and despite it's central location we had virtually no noise - just the very occasional emergency vehicle siren that you get in any big city. We didn't use the hotel restaraunt as there are so many great places to eat nearby we explored New York's cuisine. We would certainly recommend the Sofitel and would stay there again."
199,1912,"Dec 16 2008 	Lovely hotel with european style but lacking a certain something.	Stayed here recently in one of the larger queen bed rooms. The location of the hotel was great, I had a view of the Chrysler Building out my window, and I was shocked at how quiet and restful it was inside my room. The room service food was delicious, but be warned: each time estimate they gave me (i.e. &quot;your breakfast will be there in 30 minutes, ma'am&quot;) was off by at least double. One time it took 1.5 hours to get a sandwich up, but at least they comped me. My two main complaints are: the towels and robes feel as scratchy as sandpaper and the lobby is blah. So, the towels. For a room that retails for over $2k a night (we got a better deal, but still), the towels were unbelievably scratchy, and shouldn't be. Worth noting, the bed was super comfortable and soft sheets, though the down comforter on top was very hot, and it was frustrating that there was no blanket on the bed as a lighter option. Second, the lobby. For a upscale NYC hotel, I would have hoped for more ambiance and action in the lobby, something more Ian Schraeger-esque. As another reviewer said, it's more like a very stylish pass-through. A missed opportunity on their part, I think. Overall, liked this hotel very much, perfect for an upscale business travel visit (as long as you're careful when you plan your room service calls before meetings) or fun trip to the city..."
200,1912,"Dec 15 2008 	Great for a first timer to NYC	I was really surprised to find a package deal on Expedia that included a hotel ranked (by Tripadvisor) as third in New York.The good:(1) The location is absolutely superb. You capture the essence of NYC as you are jammed between 5th Ave and Broadway - Times Square is two blocks away.(2) The gym is great, with plenty of machines, free weights and towels. Another good feature of the gym is that it is open 24/7 via the swipe access card used for your room.(3) The bed is awesome, and there is lots of warmth in the room with controllable heating / air conditioning. I did appreciate a window that opened as well, as sometimes the cleaning staff sprayed an awful 'air freshener' that made the room smell stale and off.(4) The front door men are very genuine and helpful - and extremely knowledgeable. Make sure you ask them for help or direction if you are unsure - and then remember that they deserve a tip at the end of your journey.(5) Power shower and big bath - always bonuses when you spend the day walking the streets.The little things:(1) The rooms are decent size and well appointed. The decor is great - although I still cant work out why we had a picture of the Eiffel Tower in our room!(2) Bath robes and extra towels are a nice touch. The so so:(1) There is not much of a view from where we were, but that was ok - you are in New York. If you want views go outside!(2) The desk service and concierge are ok. Nothing special - nothing bad - just run of the mill...I would stay here again, but only for the gym and the location. Other than that, I would look for somewhere cheaper."
201,1912,"Dec 13 2008 	Decent location and bed the rest...	To start with the positive: terrific location with 5th Ave and Broadway on your doorstep. The bed was, as expected in any Sofitel, comfortable.And now the less good. The suite was not ready on arrival at 3pm. when it was finally available, the heating had been left switched off - took ages to warm the place up. There was no heating equipment whatsoever in the bathroom: let me repeat that - no heating, in December, in New York in a $900+ a night room! The aircon was noisy and on the 27th floor, the whirring of the hotel's roof fans was way too audible.Rooms looked tired. So-so view. Housekeeping adequate but only just. Front desk staff (Eric, I'm talking about you) seemed a trifle clueless.Public areas nice enough with an attractive bar area. Service in both the bar and hotel varied from indifferent to poor.Not a patch on the London Sofitel, with only its location to recommend it."
202,1912,"Dec 10 2008 	great location; not bowled over by hotel	The vast majority of reviews of this hotel are positive and there is certainly no denying the location is perfect, within easy walking distance of all the main tourist and shopping attractions.The rooms are comfortable and well equipped but not perfect. The curtains in our room (918) were stained, the flat panel TV had just been plonked on the table blocking half the mirror (not a big deal but shows a lack of thought) and the hair drier provided was a joke for a good quality hotel charging these prices. Housekeeking provided something better immediately on request but surely that should have been standard. Small points but ones that make the difference between a great hotel and a good one.Most disappointing was the lack of any heart or soul in the communal areas. The reception, lobby, concierge desk and bar all are located in discrete sections of the ground which make you feel as if you are just passing through a series of rooms rather than being in a building with any warmth or atmosphere. Silly point to make but having stayed earlier this year in the Sofitel Water Tower in Chicago which was great, I had high expectations for New York and it fell short.Suffice to say, given the huge choice of hotels in NYC and many in equally good locations, I will try elsewhere for my next trip rather than return to the Sofitel.The service in the bar was also shockingly slow - but maybe we are just quick drinkers!"
203,1912,Dec 8 2008 	Better than best review	Arrived via taxi from La Guardia - driving into 44th from 6th saw scaffolding on left which obliterated sign for Sofitel - panic - but when we arrived at door our expectations were surpassed. Such friendly and efficient staff from front door to reception to housekeeping - faultless. The convenience for all attactions was amazing and we have no hesitation in recommending hotel to our friends and family. Stayed 15-20 October and weather was beautiful. We will return!! Got breakfast in diner with scaffolding (Red Flame) (on going works on upper floors) great breakfast and cheap! Endless coffee!
204,1912,"Dec 3 2008 	the best hotel in nyc	I've been to new york at least twice a year now for ages and this was the best hotel i've ever stayed in.we were in room 2028with a view of the rock. staff were superb and we dined therequite a lot and were recognised and welcomed every night.the rooms were spotless, the location was perfect for shopping and dining. I would not even think about another hotel in nyc"
205,1912,"Dec 2 2008 	Ideal base in New York	Just back from a 4 night stay at the Sofitel and enjoyed it. We stayed in room 2021, the bed was so comfortable and the bathroom had a large shower. The only down side was that we booked a smoking room and had that confirmed in an email but when we arrived no smoking rooms were available so they said that although our room was officially non smoking they would send us up an ashtray, and despite that and also asking the chambermaid twice, no ashtray ever arrived over the 4 days that we stayed but it did not detract from our stay.As others have said the hotel is in a great location being only 2 blocks from Broadway. As we were only on the 20th floor we overlooked the roofs and back walls of other hotels but did have a great view of the Chrysler Building which looks brilliant at night when it is lit up.Others have mentioned the Red Flame diner as being good, the food is very good and it is only about 100 yards from the hotel, turn right when leaving the hotel.Another good place for breakfast is Ellens Starlight Diner on Broadway, about 51st Street and Broadway I think.For dinner and drinks try the St Andrews bar, again turn right when leaving the hotel and it is 1 block down and on the left, the food is very good and they have English beers on tap and a mind boggling array of whiskey.Overall we enjoyed the stay and Vladimir on the concierge desk was very helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable. All other staff were pleasant and when we left the doorman got us a great deal on the trip to Newark airport by getting us a Lincoln town car, a nice little touch of luxury, and it cost $15 dollars less than the yellow taxi that we got from Newark to the hotel when we arrived."
206,1912,"Dec 2 2008 	Superb Hotel and Rooms	If only all hotels were like this one! Now we know why it enjoys such a good rating on Trip Advisor!Hotel Website seems to be the cheapest place to book?This hotel is a truly lovely one to stay in. The rooms are maintained to a very high standard. There is a large flat screen television, the bedding and pillows are perfect and there is even a Bose radio with easy to operate alarm clock in the room. Room 1403 which was allocated to us had a separate shower to the bath, always a nice feature rather than having a shower curtain over the bath. Reception and entrance to the hotel is of a high standard and there were no faults or difficulties, in fact, if all hotels worked like this one there would never be any need for any complaints. Overall a great experience and somewhere to return to in New York merely yards from Fifth Avenue so great for shopping as well as seeing the sights of New York."
207,1912,Nov 27 2008 	Very Good	Good location and very clean hotel. Staff very friendly and very close to Time Square
208,1912,"Nov 27 2008 	Great hotel great location great service	We booked this hotel based on the reviews on this site. We were not disappointed! We were upgraded to a King room on the 22nd floor with an amazing view of the Chrysler building. The rate we had included breakfast which was lovely, but I wouldn't have paid for it separately as I would say it was quite pricey for what you got.The concierge was so helpful (they confirmed restaurant and airport transfer reservations for us) and the doormen really friendly.The room was lovely and spacious and the bed, I promise, is the best bed I have EVER slept in. I need to invest in one of those fluffy duvet style mattress covers..."
209,1912,"Nov 26 2008 	Nothing to fault	Sofitel offers a well located respite from the city. We recently stayed for three nights and can't fault any aspect of the hotel's service throughout our stay. Location just off Fifth Ave and two minutes to Times Square offers close proximity on an upmarket quiet cross street with neighbouring bars, restaurants better than most in the neighbourhood. Good size rooms and bathrooms; faultless service. No complaints."
210,1912,"Nov 20 2008 	Good Quality Hotel Central Location	We stayed for four nights and found the hotel to be exactly as most other reviewers had described. The location is very good, midway between 5th and 6th Avenues, and only 5 minutes walk from Times Square and Grand Central Station.The rooms were excellent, and spotlessly cleaned daily. The staff at the hotel were very helpful on checking in and checking out, but to be honest, other than the doorman when we departed, had very little contact with us during our stay.I had read before travelling that many people recommended the local diner for breakfast. (The Red Flame) - excellent place with plenty served up.The internet area was a little small, and quite often too busy too try to check emails etc. This could be improved by the hotel. Otehrwise, would recommend to anyone visiting New York."
211,1912,"Nov 14 2008 	Great Location	My wife and I stopped at the Sofitel for three nights in October 2008. It was the final leg of a world trip celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. It was great ! A warm &amp; friendly welcome with a great comfortable room. WE had everything we expected. Yes, the room was a little on the small side but it gave us what we wanted. This was our first visit to New York, without doubt the location was great, 3 minutes from Times Square. WE WOULD BOOK AGAIN &amp; RECOMMEND TO OUR FRIENDS. One tip, if you go for the bus tour where you just jump on and off, go for the blue bus city tour and not the red bus tour. There are loads more blue buses than red ones."
212,1912,"Nov 12 2008 	Perfect stay	Just got back from a 3 night stay in NY and the hotel was just perfect from the moment we arrived to departure. As soon as we climbed off the shuttle, staff were on hand to welcome us take cases to our room.We quickly checked in and had been given an upgraded room on the 19th floor with lots of space and the most comfortable king size bed ever. Beautiful bathroom and excellent facilities throughout.All staff very helpful throughout and room service brought my wife a complimentary cheesecake up to the room on our arrival as we were there after her birthday. Not much I know but it was unexpected, a great surprise and showed just how much they cared about there guest.All fantastic.I saw other reviewers mention the RedFlame diner a few doors away. Went everyday for breakfast and loved that too. Very well worth a visit or 3"
213,1912,"Nov 12 2008 	You don't need to worry - very nice hotel	Just back from a 3 night stay over the weekend at the Sofitel. As usual, I booked this on the strength of it's reviews and I expect I'll be staying again in the future.The location is good for everything I wanted to do/see as it's fairly central. A 5 min walk to the west and you're at Times Square (and just beyond that, Madison Square Garden - Well Done Joe Calzaghe - what a great night!). 2 Mins to the east and you're on Fifth Ave. The other plus point of the location is that it fronts onto 44th and 45th Streets, both of which aren't too busy at night and, hence, don't suffer from too much traffic noise (I didn't notice any whatsoever from the 12th floor).Everywhere within the hotel is absolutely spotless.The Bar is nice, although it closes to residents at 1:00am (but there are nearby bars open 'til 4:00am).We only used the restaurant once for dinner as we packed quite a lot into our trip but, again, the food was good.Others may disagree but I actually didn't find the staff overly friendly - they were very good and efficient and helped with any queries but they just didn't seem to smile very much. This isn't a big issue though and you'd be hard pushed to find anything of any substance to gripe about."
214,1912,"Nov 7 2008 	highly recommended	I booked a trip to NYC as a surprise for my boyfriends 30th at the end of oct for 4 nights. when it came to hotels sofitel stood out when reading the reviews on tripadvisor. I was a little apprehensive that it wouldn't live up to the hype but thankfully I have to say that it did. location was ideal. arriving at the hotel to see the bright lights of times sq along the street was great. best parts for me were:(1)the friendly approachable staff- especially the fantastic concierge service who sorted out trips/tickets for us and suggested the perfect place for a meal and night out on the town!!(2)the bed was truely comfortable, after a long day of sight-seeing. we had a queen size room and it was more than spacious enough. (3)the cocktails at the bar were fantastic and the bar girl was more than happy to make us cocktails that weren't on the menu - possibly the best long island ice tea we've tasted!!overall, I would definately recommend sofitel, its higher priced but very worth it."
215,1912,"Nov 2 2008 	Excellent Hotel	I Stayed in theis hotel for three nights while on a shopping break in the big apple.The location of the hotel is excellent, mid town just off 5th Ave.we booked in early in early and received an upgrade, the room we got was beautiful and spacious , the bathroom was also spacious.We found the staff to be very helpful. There is quite a niec bar int the hotel, relaxing after a days shopping. We only ate one evening in the hotel and the meal was lovely. Breakfast is expensive when compared to deli's in the surrounding area as are drinks when compared to home- wine $13 .Overall we were delighted with the hotel, I picked it on tripadvisor's recommendations and was not disappointed and I think it added to our trip!! and would stay there again"
216,1912,"Nov 1 2008 	Beautiful Hotel	This is a great place to stay in NYC. The hotel is located on 44/45th streets between 5th and 6th aves. It's close to Times Square, Bryant Park (Ice rink here at the moment), Subway, and plenty of restraurants (and obviously, 5th Ave!). We stayed in a Queen room, which would be the most &quot;basic&quot; thay have, but it was lovely. The bed was really comfortable with loads of fluffy pillows! Slippers and dressing robes provided and a huge TV. We were also given bottles of Evian each evening.This room was a lovely place to return to after a long day's trotting around the city.The bar and restraurant downstairs is nice, but food was overpriced. They're aimimg high with their menu, a sort of &quot;fine dining&quot; experience, but they're not quite hitting the mark, so I'd go elsewhere. If that's the sort of food you're after, try &quot;DB Bistro Moderne&quot; which is two doors down the street (on 44th heading towards 6th ave); the fois gras stuffed burger is pretty original!There's also an organic deli a few doors away on 45th street. If you're a foodie, tread carefully in NYC. Don't just pop in to what looks nice, get a good guide book and take your time!"
217,1912,"Oct 30 2008 	Sofitel is grand.....	As all the other reviewers have said this hotel lovely, from lobby to bathroom its beautiful. Our room was on the 16th floor, no great view. My main complaint is, when I checked in I was informed that the privilage card was been replaced by some other card and that all points would have to be used up by Feburary 2009.... fair enough. Oh, and by the way the free drink at check in in no longer available, darn..... Ok..... and ah, the late checkout is no longer available either, oh come on..... they could have emailed me and informed me about the changes...."
218,1912,"Oct 29 2008 	Loved the Sofitel	Just returned from a four night break in NYC staying in the Sofitel. I agree with previous reviewers, the location is excellent for all the major landmarks. The Hotel is really lovely. We got upgraded to a suite on the top floor (29)! The food in the hotel was really good. We mostly ate off the bar menu and it was not expensive at all for what we got. It was a pleasant surprise. We did have breakfast in the Red Flame down the street as recommended by other reviewers but we found that it was really too much food, however it was a typical american diner and loved the experience. Would definitely stay at the Sofitel Hotel again and would recommend it to everyone."
219,1912,Oct 24 2008 	Perfect location for a citytrip	We stayed there for five nights in a Standart Room. The location of the hotel is just fantastic! It is just a 5 Minute walkt to Times Square and 5th Avenue. The room was very clean and hat all the comfort we needed. Despite the central location it was not noisy at all during the night. I was very surprised and I can recommend this hotel to anyone.
220,1912,"Oct 23 2008 	Loved the Sofitel!	We stayed in the Sofitel New York for 5 nights and I honestly cannot fault the hotel. The location is spot on - couple of blocks away from Times Square/Broadway/ 5th Avenue..... The room size for New York is really good, comfy large bed and a massive flat screen TV. The room was spotlessly clean and had a good powerful shower and we never heard any outside noise.We had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar which was good and as the drinks in New York are expensive everywhere; the drinks were competively priced and you got the bonus of sum complimentary cheesy snacks and olives!I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again."
221,1912,"Oct 15 2008 	Great Hotel!	My husband and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Sofitel. The hotel is clean and comfortable and our king-size room was a pleasant surprise after all the comments about small hotel rooms in NYC. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the tourist sites. The concierge is helpful and will book restaurants, transport etc 'with pleasure' We also found the doorman absolutely great at finding taxis! With two other hotels nearby, that was not always an easy task and he did it so cheerfully &amp; willingly - even going further down the street to locate any taxis that were free. We checked in very late and were greeted courteously by the friendly staff on duty. Our allocated room was on a very high floor - I had requested a view - but when I confirmed that it was just too high for me, there was no problem about moving to a different (bigger!) room on a lower floor.We had good room service and it was lovely returning after a tiring day, to a turned-down, very comfy bed, with great linen! Receiving a small box of chocolates on the pillow was an extra, pleasant surprise (although we did wonder why that happened on only one night!). We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel (we found the nearby cafes were not up to the standard we expected in the USA) - and cocktails and coffee with 'nibbles' in the lounge, provided a pleasant respite before dinner. Our only grouse would be about the brunch &amp; dinner menus, which were rather uninspired. Two waiters we'd like to commend, for being helpful and attentive - while also not intruding were .... Edmund and the tallest waiter in the restaurant, -whose name unfortunately we didn't get, as he wasn't wearing a nametag.We would return to Sofitel NYC, because of the good attitude of staff towards clients and its fantastic location."
222,1912,"Oct 11 2008 	Fantastic hotel	Stayed at Sofitel in April. Was our 10th wedding annivesary. Contacted hotel to confirm booking and advised of our celebration. Didn't want anything to disappoint my better half.When we arrived at 1.00pm (flew Delta - disappointing but another story) we advised we were early to check in but could we leave bags at hotel to have a look around. Took us straight to reception and we were able to check in. Stayed on floor 26. When we got to room we had been upgraded to a suite - absolutely fantastic. I have nothing but praise for America and how they treat people. Perhaps i've been lucky but love it there.Bed was the best I have ever slept in, cleanliness and nice touches made this a dream annivesary. Staff were charming and the quality of the hotel second to none. Shops: close to everywhere - 5th avenue, times square, central park. We did a 2 day bus tour and went to Brooklyn and aside from the bus walked everywhere. Felt safe at all times. As previous comments from other reviewers went to breakfast diner 30 seconds from hotel. Good start to day. New York has it all but if you want a bit of luxury and to be close to all areas this hotel has it all. My better half wants to go back!"
223,1912,"Oct 10 2008 	Holiday of a lifetime	My partner and I stayed in the Sofitel New York for 10 fabulous days. We were given a room upgrade on checking in and had a lovely big king size room with a great view of the Rockefeller Centre. Room very tastefully furnished with the biggest, most comfortable bed ever. Big flat screen TV for the odd time when you want to chill out. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel is absolutely beautiful. The evening turn down service was a lovely extra touch and unexpected for a New York hotel. The reviews indicated the hotel was close to everything but it was even closer than expected. 5 minutes walk to Times Square or Grand Central Station. 15 minutes walk to Central Park. 2 minutes walk to 5th Avenue (a great place to buy engagement rings!!!!). Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there on my next visit to New York"
224,1912,"Oct 8 2008 	Very Nice	I generally book most of my hotels through Priceline or a travel website, however I specifically wanted to stay at this property for a birthday surprise for a girl.I read many of the reviews here and contact the hotel directly after booking and made a few small personalized requests. All of them were handled with no trouble.Upon arriving at the hotel, the room I had booked was not available and I was a bit upset over the wait (I could not be given an accurate time). Once in the room, it was very plush. Those who know what a &quot;sizable&quot; room in Manhattan is would appreciate this.We did order room service for one meal because we did not want to go out. However, it was extremely poor. The manager did take care of this on my bill upon check out. Very quick and painless.Overall, an impressive stay. Obviously, like anywhere in Manhattan, a little pricey, but quite nice."
225,1912,"Oct 7 2008 	Fantastique Sofitel	Spent 5 nights in this fantastic hotel. Loved the lobby with its gorgeous flowers. Situated perfectly for Times Square, Broadway et al. Hotel staff were fantastic - gave us an upgrade without having to ask. Rooms were excellent - particularly the shower. would totally recommend this hotel for all occasions."
226,1912,"Oct 6 2008 	Loved the Sofitel	This is a first rate, first class hotel just a short walk from Times Square. The rooms are fabulously well appointed and spotlessly clean. The staff are very friendly and so helpful. We were lucky enough to be given a suite of rooms - it was the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The suite was enormous with a huge bed. We had a seperate lounge and 2 huge flat screen TV's. There was a marble bathroom with a big bath and seperate shower. We had room service for breakfast which was first class! Wheeled into the room on it's own table - it felt very luxurious!"
227,1912,"Oct 2 2008 	Superb and convenient	Spent a long weekend as part of our Anniversary trip here. Very clean, comfortable and convenient for everything. The staff were so helpful and friendly. The Consierge was the best we have ever experienced. The rooms were large and so lovely we were reluctant to leave. The breakfast was the best we have ever had."
228,1912,"Sep 29 2008 	Sofitel New York -a wonderful experience	The Sofitel New York is one of the best International Hotel experiences I have had. We stayed there for a total of 7 nights. The rooms are wonderful, and the staff are very helpful. The breakfast is great and overall the Hotel is an Oasis in the heart of a very busy city. It was a pleasure to return to the peace and quiet of the Hotel after a busy day of sight seeing and shopping.The central location made it very easy to access all parts of New York city by foot or by taxi. We loved this Hotel."
229,1912,"Sep 28 2008 	Beautiful!	Incredible hotel and service. Should be rated #1.Booked on hotel's website and got a &quot;3 nights getaway&quot; for $426/night. So, if you book early enough, you can get a decent rate (for NYC). We wanted to extend our stay but the rate would have been $770, so we declined. Went to Casablanca for $419/night (see review) - not good.The quality of the room exceeded out expectations. Everything was new and perfect. 42 inch Plasma TV, bathroom, closet, bed, furniture, central A/C...were just amazing.Also, perfectly quiet. This must to hard to do in NYC.We ate at the Red Flame diner down the street for breakfast. It's a pretty good deal. We did not try the hotel restaurant.Internet service is an additional cost through T-Mobile.Great time!"
230,1912,"Sep 26 2008 	Honeymoon in NYC	We started off on our honeymoon by visiting NYC, after many hours spent reviewing hotels in NYC om Trip Advisor, i finally decided to go for Sofitel. When we first arrived at hotel i was delighted i had chosen this place, The hotel is lovely from the outside, the lobby inside is beautiful as well and check in was very smooth, we received a free upgrade to the executive suite on the 26th floor since it was our honeymoon!! what a start to the trip, the views were lovely, the room was huge with a seperate living area, there were 2 large LCD tvs in room as well whic was nice, 2 Mini bars which werent overly expensive, after all you are in NYC, $7 for a beer.The hotel bar was nice and quiet as well, i also used th gym which i found was excellent filled with top of the range equipment, the free internet access in the lobby as well was a nice touch.The staff were superb, they took our luggage off us on arrival and brough it up to our room, Concierge was there as well although we didnt use them.We ate out in some wonderful restaurants over there so we didnt sample the hotel food, overall i only have positive things to say about this hotel. the Location of it is perfect, and its beautifully kept and well maintained, oh yah and the sofibeds in the suites were the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on.Book the Sofitel, you will love it just like we did"
231,1912,"Sep 22 2008 	Great hotel	Huge rooms, very clean, lovely bathrooms, comfy beds, nicely decorated. Great location for everything. Only slight issue is the slow check-in as they tend to employ French staff."
232,1912,"Sep 21 2008 	Loved the Sofitel	We booked the Sofitel Hotel via the internet. It has a really good location, a few minutes walk from Fifth Avenue, and about ten minutes from Times Square but although central to New York, it is tucked away in a quiet street with several other hotels. We always felt comfortable returning late at night to the hotel. We booked two deluxe queen sized rooms and they were identical to the photos on their website. The rooms were on the 11th floor, spacious and very clean. The bed was really comfortable with a mattress topper, a pleasure to get into at the end of a hard day sightseeing and the hotel is so quiet, you can't hear traffic noise or other guests! The bathrooms were lovely, beautiful large stand-in showers with separate baths. The Sofitel provides Roger Gallet shower gels and body lotions, I preferred the hotel's to my own shower gel and ended up using their products. The hotel hairdryer also actually worked better than my own so I won't take mine next time. We had booked room-only, so we didn't have breakfast at the hotel but they do have a nice restaurant at the hotel. We chose to go to a diner just down the road from the hotel called the Red Flame (turn right on leaving the hotel). They do excellent breakfasts for less than $10 pp. and include omlettes, pancakes with maple syrup, cooked breakfasts or just fresh fruit salad and croissants even porridge. We did try another place one morning, but it just couldn't compare.We flew from the UK to Newark and we pre-booked transportation to the hotel for 38 through Expedia (there were four of us). We ended up waiting an hour at the airport for the transportation minibus. A cost saving way to get to the hotel is the Airport Express coach. From Newark it drops off at 5th Avenue, 42nd street which is about five minutes walk to the hotel, it costs $25 return or $15 single and I would probably use this next time. We chose to get a taxi from the hotel to the airport on our return and we agreed a price of $120 (but I am not sure if that is a good price or not, again there were four of us). The hotel provides computers in the hotel lobby which gave free internet access, really helpful if you want to check in for your return flight or just get information on an attraction. The staff at the hotel couldn't be more helpful or friendly and always happy to offer advice or provide maps and information. We would definitely stay here again, we loved it."
233,1912,"Sep 17 2008 	Faultless	Perfect in every wayLocation, value, comfort, service, foodDon't hesitate, book now"
234,1912,"Sep 17 2008 	Fantastic !	After reading lots of reviews at TripAdvisor, for different hotels in NY, I finally desided on the Sofitel New York.We stayed 5 nights at this hotel, and I don't think we could have found anything better ! Yes, quite expensive, but not more than other 4 star hotels in central NY (even some 3 star hotels that was this expensive...)The hotel is very close to everything, and we only walked for probably for 4-5 minutes to get to Times Square.We had a queen size bed, and the room was pretty good size. The bed was very comfy, but pillows too soft... One of the reasons I picked this hotel was the bathroom ! And it was a bit smaller than it looked in the pictures, but supernice and clean !! Both shower and bathtub (separate). Lots of space to place soaps and shampoos in the shower and also lots of space for toiletries by the sink and mirror. Very handy makeup-mirror as well.The aircondition was working very well, and not very noisy (something I have experienced in other american hotels...)We got a room on the 9th floor, and did not have any trouble with traffic or noise from the street.The staff was supernice and very helpful. The concierge helped us with booking our helicopter sightseeing, distances within the city, umbrellas in the rain and helped us weigh our bags before we left for the airport.We did not try the restaurant at the hotel, but it definately looked nice.If you want a cheaper breakfast (eggs, bacon, hash, pancakes etc) just go out of the hotel to the right (west on 44th, towards Broadway) and there is a restaurant called the Red Flame (i think..), like the diners you see in the movies :):), ...Red sign over the door, fast service, not very smiling staff but good food !I will definately stay at the Sofitel again when I go back to New York. Fantastic hotel situated in the heart of Manhattan."
235,1912,Sep 15 2008 	Great hotel great location....	We booked the Sofitel for our trip to New York based on the reviews on Tripadvisor. I have to say it absolutely exceeded expectations!Our trip to New York was a wedding present to my husband the main purpose of which was to see the US Open Men's Tennis Final.On arrival we were told we had been upgraded to a Suite on the 18th floor. I have to say the room was stunning with a separate living and dressing area. The marble bathroom was huge and the bed was very very comfortable. The room was spotless and was cleaned daily. Our bed was turned down every night and some chocolates and 2 bottles of water were left each night also.Our room had a view of the Chrysler Building so the view to wake up to was spectacular!Due to the rain that hit New York on Saturday 6th Sept the tennis final was re-arranged to Monday which was the day we were due to return home. Brook at the Concierge desk was fantastic and contacted Ticketmaster to sort out our tickets and also re-arranged our flights home (for a minimal cost which was great as they were meant to be non transferable). We were also not only allowed to keep our amazing suite but were offered a late check out on the Tuesday and the extra cost for the extra night was the same rate that we had paid for the original booking.The hotel has a great location and you can walk to pretty much anywhere in midtown.The hotel also has a great bar that we used to get a glass of champagne (for which we were given complimentary tickets on arrival).All in all a great experience at this hotel and I would not hestitate to go back! The hotel is a bit pricey but certainly well worth it!
236,1912,"Sep 14 2008 	Surprisingly poor bed	We booked a room with a queen size bed for a long weekend. When we got to our room we realized that all the bedding was down feathers. My husband is allergic to down. We had also been given a double bed. We asked for the bedding to be changed. It was changed, but what it was replaced with was really substandard. The mattress pad was cheap and wrinkled up under us when we slept. At one point when I tried to straighten it out, I realized that the mattress itself was covered in feathers and other debris. The next day we asked for it to be vacuumed but this did not happen. The mattress was at best mediocre; we could feel the springs in the mattress when we slept. This is not what we expected at a Sofitel.The other surprising thing was food debris on the floor. There was a Cherrio, yes the cereal, on the floor, it remained there for our stay.Otherwise the room was quiet, had good curtains, a lovely TV and bathroom. The bathroom had both a nice shower and a big bathtub. There are three computers in the lobby, and they were useful for obtaining our boarding passes for the trip home.We had a great time in New York, but the Sofitel was rather disappointing."
237,1912,"Sep 5 2008 	Fantastic The Best Ever !!!!!	From the moment we arrived to the day we left (very sad) it was the best hotel we have stayed in whilst in New York. Please believe me when I say that I am so picky on my choice of hotel, last time we stayed in the Four Seasons and the Sofitel outshines them by miles. The staff are just fantastic in every department nothing is too much trouble and you are always met we a smile and bonjour. The rooms are lovley big and clean, the bathroom was great with super high class products and with a power shower to die for. The Gaby bar and restuarant were great, the food superb (we did all three breakfast, lunch and dinner) and the bar very relaxing with a great range of drinks. The location of the hotel is also great for getting around and you are right in the centre of things without it being noisy, the hotel is situated on a very nice quiet street, the lobby is fresh and cool as you walk in and the free internet in the lobby is a great touch (always avaialble within a few minutes).Please take my advise do not miss out on this great hotel it was a fantastic stay and I have already booked to go back next year, THANK YOU SOFITEL NEW YORK"
238,1912,"Sep 3 2008	Overrated	This is a very average hotel. it is all clean and nicely done but lacking atmosphere in the common parts. The staff were good and attentive. The restaurant is very overpriced. The rooms are perfectly adequate. All things are relative and compared to the obscene pricing of the top class hotels in NYC this represents a good deal, but put it in many other locations in the world and you would be very disappointed for the money. I will try other other hotels and try and find one that is not so soul less."
239,1912,"Sep 2 2008	Excellent midtown hotel	An excellent New York midtown hotel. Certainly up to the high standards that we have come to expect from Sofitel. A perfect location. Walking distance to just about everything, including 2 or 3 different subway stops. The service was extremely good, including the front desk staff, the concierge and staff in the bar/restaurant. Overall, a very intimate larger hotel. The rooms were very nice. The bathroom was quite large and very beautifully decorated. The hotel, including the rooms, is very quiet. There was virtually no street noise to interfere with a good night's sleep. Very efficient air conditioning, even on a very hot day. One minor complaint - the standard rooms should have a king size bed, not a queen size. The rooms could easily handle the slightly larger bed. Overall, an extremely well located, designed and run hotel. Highly recommended."
240,1912,"Sep 1 2008 	Service Drops a Star from Last Visit	I stayed at Sofitel New York in February, and wrote a review giving the hotel 5 stars for a perfect visit. Six months later, I would say the front desk service I received has cost them a star.Overall, I was happy. The room was clean and wonderfully quiet, the bed was great, and the room service we had one evening was lovely. We reserved the Chic Picnic deal that got us one free night out of 4, and a lovely picnic basket filled with gourmet sandwiches, salads, fresh fruit, and home-baked cookies, and a bottle of Champagne. It was fabulous, as was our &quot;welcome&quot; cocktail and the late checkout. The problem was, we had to ask for these things, when they should have been mentioned at check in. I presented my Sofitel Privilege card, which should be enough to get the conversation started about the welcome cocktails and the late checkout. I booked the Chic Picnic package, which should have meant that the staff would ask us when we'd like it. I ended up feeling like I was groveling for freebies, which should not have been the case.So, overall, things were great, but I felt sort of awkward with regard to the front desk. I'm not sure if my next trip will find me at Sofitel or not, but I must say if you are a light sleeper, this is the place for you. I cannot believe how quiet the room was- no street noise at all!"
241,1912,"Sep 1 2008 	excellent time	Stayed here for a wedding anniversary and booked a deluxe room. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite on the top floor which was very nice. A good start to any trip.The room was very clean and well appointed with an excellent size shower. The bed was very comfortable - even better than the very expensive orthopaedic bed we have at home. One small problem was that we couldn't connect our ipod to the TV and so had to listen to the rubbish supplied music channels.The location was second to none, right in the heart of theatre land and 5mins walk away from Times Sq. When we have stayed in NY before we have avoided this classic tourist location but it was excellent.Room service was very good and very prompt, often a problem in big hotels. The breakfast restaurant was a bit cramped and the menu limited but the food was good. We didn't eat in the main restaurant but spoke to other guests who recommended it.The concierge excelled himself and got us tickets to all of the shows that we wanted to see, good seats too.We would defiantly return again."
242,1912,"Aug 31 2008 	very good hotel	I was traveling alone in the USA for work and I wanted to take a long weekend of vacation in New York City since I have never visited that city. I wanted an hotel in a strategic position and this one is located in the heart of manhattan, 5 minutes from Times Square.Before booking this hotel I had a look at other different options, but this looked to be the best option for quality and price. I used the offer called chic-picnic since it was the cheapest one and was giving me a room on a high floor and it also included a picnic basket full of food prepared by their restaurant (which gave me an excuse to have a nice picnic in Central Park, 20 minutes walk from the hotel).The hotel is very nice, I was in a room at the 24th floor so I had also a very nice view from the window. The room was big and with a very nice bathroom that had both a shower and a bathroom tub. The only thing that I didn't like very much was that the internet connection is not complimentary and you have to buy it on-line. I found this a bit strange for an hotel of this category and, even if I was of vacation, I needed to have the possibility to check at least my emails. A nice thing was that every night I found a complimentary bottle of water in my room and the stereo switched on with some classical and very relaxing music.The restaurant of the hotel is also very good with a very good service. I always had breakfast there even if it was a bit expensive, but the quality is very high. All the staff of the hotel was always very nice and you don't need to dress in a special way to get their attention as often happens in other luxury hotels. I would strongly recommend this hotel and I would for sure use it again for a vacation in New York CIty."
243,1912,Aug 29 2008 	Great hotel	This hotel is quite a gem. The rooms are decent sized. The room and bathroom itself was really clean. The beds were so comfy. We were on the 6th floor and I never heard any noise except for the occasional police siren. The staff was very accomodating and polite. It's close to 5th Ave and Times Square without the hustle and bustle feel. I couldn't have asked for more.
244,1912,Aug 28 2008 	OVERATED!	Expected a much better room for the price. This hotel is overated. My room was on the third floor and the windows looked as if they had never been cleaned.
245,1912,"Aug 27 2008 	Amazing hotel	I have to say I really loved this hotel, from the minute I arrived I felt totally relaxed. The staff at the reception were really nice and i was very impressed with the room. The bathroom especially was really really nice, seperate large bath and shower. On our last day when we were storing our luggage the guy at the front door offered to have a car there for us on when we got back to bring us to the airport. We were well impressed when the car turned out to be a limo at no extra charge. Location is spot on, 5 minute walk from everything you wanna see. Would definite recommend, myself and my boyfriend loved it."
246,1912,"Aug 26 2008 	Good all round	Great location, service, room, staff.Reasonable price for service provided, particularly in Manhattan.Extremely quiet, despite very central location.Beware minibar - a bottle of Evian at 15$ seems like a ripoff.Decent enough gym and facilities."
247,1912,"Aug 25 2008 	Excellency!!!	Hello everyone!!! Once again I trust the reviews and choose this hotel for a week in NY, and it was an excellent choice.We have a wonderfull stay, in a very comfortable room. The staff is very good, they treated us as we were the only guests at the hotel (they were many families).We have several breakfasts and dinners at the Gaby (inside th hotel), excellent food and service.Overall the hotel it`s well located, inside the room you can`t feel the city, the satff is excellent . The last day we have the chek out at 3pm but we stayed until 6pm and they didin`t charged us a penny.Very Nice!!! We will definitely come back.Thanks for all the reviews!!!"
248,1912,"Aug 24 2008 	very nice hotel	Me and my husband stayed at the sofitel for 8 nights. The overall experience was very satisfying. Very clean, tasteful and spacious rooms. I especially liked the bathroom, and I also found the beds very comfortable and relaxing. Unfortunately, we could only get a room on the 8th floor-that's the only smoking floor- so we didn't have any view. The hotel is situated in the centre of Manhattan, very close to Times Square, and is a good place to start your walks around the city."
249,1912,"Aug 24 2008 	Simply THE BEST	Sofitel provides you with the BEST location, the BEST suites, and outstanding hotel staff. You will feel like a vip from the moment you arrive. Hotel is new and classy."
250,1912,"Aug 19 2008 	Best beds ever	Incredible beds - can't say enough about them - great pillows and soft comforter - this in its own gives this place a five out of five. Location is very good - close to Times Square (not that you'd want to spend time around there) but far enough to get away from that madness. The staff were all very friendly, always greeting us several times as we entered and left the Hotel. Had room service one night - excellent hamburgers. My only complaint would be that the bathtubs were very shallow - not worth having a good soak. Other than that would 100% stay at this hotel again."
251,1912,"Aug 18 2008 	superb hotel	From the minute we arrived we loved our stay at this hotel, the only thing that upset me was that we were in New York and spent very little time at the excellent hotel. Everything thing we asked for we got, service was excellent, room was great, bed was brilliant Bathroom and particluarly the shower was Fab. Got what i thought was a good deal through Expedia as we booked flights as well. Its was a bit more expensive than some but way cheaper than lots as well,All in all we thought the hotel was excellent"
252,1912,"Aug 18 2008 	Loved the Sofitel NYC	I took my 16 year old daughter to New York for a shopping and Theatre 5 day treat. The Sofitel was brilliant- great staff- fax with GCSE results slid effortlessly under the door at 5.00am, helpful friendly staff, and a fantastic location - quiet so you could sleep yet a short walk to Times Square - talking of sleep, quite simply the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in!!!All In all a perfect stay- Thank-you"
253,1912,"Aug 15 2008 	Great location but still peaceful	We were in transit to Las Vegas and decided to spend a few days in New York as we had not visited the city before.The Sofitel was ideally situated on West 44th Street, near Times Square and 5th Avenue. Rooms were well appointed with comfortable bed, flat screen Tv etcThe hotel was also very quiet considering its location. Our room was on the 17th floor and just looked out over the street - nothing special but OKConcierges were VERY helpful for choosing reastaurants and later sorting out problems - see Liberty Helicopters.Gaby Bar was very pleasant retreat from bustle of the city We would certainly stay at the Sofitel again but next time will ask for a room with a view"
254,1912,"Aug 11 2008 	Most AWESOME Hotel in NYC!!!	The staff was INCREDIBLE! The location was MARVELOUS! The rooms were GREAT! Will return to this hotel in a heartbeat!!! Right by Time Square but away from all the noise, the overcrowding and dirty feeling... Right off of 5th Avenue and very close to Central Park. HIGHLY recommend this hotel!!!"
255,1912,"Aug 10 2008 	Sofitel is Excellent!!!	This was my first time in New York City and the Sofitel was excellent and worth every penny! The room, the service and the food was great! I would definitely recommend this hotel. We stayed for four nights and it was the best time ever. The hotel is in walking distance to many things, such as NBC Studios, Rockefeller plaza, Times Square and so on. Plus, it is located in a quiet area. I also enjoyed the Red Flame restaurant that was basically right next door. The food was great! We had breakfast twice there and our bill was no more than $25.00. We saw the play Grease and it was great! I plan to revisit New York City and stay at the Sofitel again."
256,1912,"Aug 9 2008 	Central Location	As Sofitel priviledge members we always stay at Sofitel Hotels where possible and the reviews on TripAdvisor for the New York Hotel were very good so we booked in for four nights.Central location and friendly staff on arrival, we were not upgraded as there were no rooms available and our room was on the 15th floor but with views over the back of buildings and fire stairs on New York, not what we had requested. The room was a standard size but we had requested a Queen size bed and it was a double. The bathroom was a good size and had all the necessities. The next morning we went down to the front desk to see if we could get our upgrade or at least a room with a better view of New York and a Queen Size bed. Apparently in New York Queen size beds are what we in Australia call double, so remember this and book your bed accordingly. We were moved to a room on the 19th floor with a better view, same size bed and so we settled for the rest of our stay. Like all Sofitels complimentary water provided each afternoon/early evening and also free internet (with a printer) again appreciated.The staff were very friendly, in particular the wonderful concergie and also William the doorman who organised a great town car to take us to the airport and who was always interested in how our days had been . The bar was nice and overall a good stay.Great little bar across the road fron the hotel - cant recall the name but good pasta and buffalo wings, you turn left as if going to fifth Street and its across the road. Also their is a post office across the road in an office building which is very close, ask William for instructions.. Also took the advice of other TripAdvisers and had breakfast each day at the little red dinner down the road, great breakfasts, good service and reasonable prices."
257,1912,"Aug 8 2008	Top choice in New York!	I was extremely happy with my choice of hotel. I stayed in New York for five nights and the Sofitel was the perfect place to stay. The location was fantastic, very central to all the major attractions: Time square and Fifth Avenue were both walking distance away, which was especially handy after lots of shoppng and walking absolutely everywhere in New York. The rooms are spacious (by New York standards), modern and very clean, making my stay very comfortable indeed. I must say the beds were oh, so comfortable....I slept very well. The bathrooms were marble and the fresh orchids were a nice touch. The hotel staff were all very professional and the concierge particularly helpful. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel and this will be my first choice when I return to New York City."
258,1912,"Aug 7 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	We travel to New York a lot but this is our first stay at the Sofitel. You cannot beat its location being so close to Times Square. We are rather picky about beds, and these were extremely comfortable. We also chose to stay in and have room service for a dinner. The food came rather quickly and it was all warm! Overall, for a Manhattan hotel room, the room size was actually generous. (Most hotel rooms I have stayed in Manhattan are rather difficult to move around in because of their small size.) We will definitely stay here again in the future."
259,1912,"Aug 5 2008 	The pillows are heavenly!	I've heard amazing things about this hotel, and it's a frequent Travelers' Choice Winner, so my expectations were extremely high. It did not disappoint. While it's in the middle of a somewhat chaotic part of town, once I entered the lobby, the heat and noise faded away. The staff was courteous, but not overbearing, and the French greetings are quite charming. My room was on a low floor (the 3rd), however I didn't hear any noise from the street. The room was spacious, the bathroom quite big. The bed was incredible - I'm picky when it comes to pillows, and they were scrumptious, as was the duvet, which did not have that nasty, dirty bedspread feel found at many hotels. Other plusses - lots of room in the closet, separate shower and tub, plenty of room in the bathroom. I traveled alone, but there would have been more than enough room for 2 in both the room and bathroom. I also liked that there were TV speakers in the bathroom - great for when you're getting ready to go out. Only a few cons - didn't love the toiletries, I've stayed at lesser hotels with higher quality products; there were no drawers to store non-hanging items; and finally, I had to replace my room key 3 times because my cell phone kept demagnetizing it. If you stay here - keep your cell phone and room key far apart! The location is great - if you're planning to spend a lot of time in midtown, or want the convenience of traveling to the upper east or west sides of town. Would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it highly."
260,1912,"Jul 25 2008 	The ratings are correct!	During our 5 day vacation in NYC we stayed at Sofitel. The hotel was chosen due to the high ratings. And we were not dissapointed. I asked for a quiet room and got room 718 which is located at the back overlooking the neighboring buildings. Not much of a sight but that was not of interest. The room was spacious with twin beds. The airconditioning made a little humm but we both slept sound. The temperature is easily adjusted in Fahrenheit or Celcius and the room is quickly cooled. I think they also use soundproof windows, the were no noise at all from the outside. Not to forget the fat 37 inch flatscreen TV!The traffic outside the hotel is modest. After a day walking in the city we longed for the entrance, it was like entering the garden of quietness. The staff were courteous and professional at all times. In Europe we often stay with Accor hotels and Sofitel NYC was no exception: high standards! Its a short walk to times square. The restaurant is very nice and we had a great brekfast every day. Next time we return to NYC, Sofitel is the only choice. Thanks to all at Sofitel for making our holiday so comfy!"
261,1912,"Jul 22 2008 	Fabulous hotel and great service!	We booked our hotel room in December as we were planning a trip to NYC for my 30th birthday. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were informed that we were upgraded to a fabulous suite. Then we received a bottle of wine from some friends and the hotel sent us a bottle of champagne. The room was incredibly comfortable--great bed, luxurious bathroom, 2 flat screen TVs. We didn't eat at the hotel but we did have cocktails there one night and the restaurant seemed nice. We ate at the Red Flame Cafe which was surprisingly good as it looked like a dive diner and was very cheap. I would definitely recommend the Sofitel!"
262,1912,"Jul 19 2008 	Sofitel is a great hotel !	We stayed at the Sofitel for four nights in July. We got a great room rate on the hotel's website booking several months in advance.The room was their standard queen room, which was quite large at 350 square feet. The bathroom was lovely-all marble. The location is great, on a quiet block of W. 44th st. Housekeeping did a great job and were very friendly. We asked for and were given an early check in.Beautiful room,great location- we would stay there again..."
263,1912,Jul 19 2008 	So far so Sofitel	This is a very good hotel. It is close to Time Square and is a welcome refuge after a hard days shopping. The rooms were comfortable and the free bottles of wine in our room and the room of our teenage daughters when we arrived to celebrate my wife's birthday was thoughtful.The only thing against the hotel was that as it is part of a chain it lacks the quirky individuality of some hotels but that is being too critical.My only gripe is that free WiFi should be the norm in 4/5 stat hotels and not a paid for extra.
264,1912,Jul 17 2008 	Reliable and as expected	Stayed for 4 days and it was a very pleasant experience. Sofitel offered a &quot;picnic package&quot; and gave us a picnic basket. We went to the nearby Bryant Park - a perfect spot! The hotel is styled in every aspect and therefore distinguishes itself from the big hotel chains - a major benefit. Especially the Gaby Bar is a great spot to have a drink after sightseeing or shopping. What we didn't like was that the room obviously was used by smokers before - not a true nonsmoking room to my understanding! The room was rather dark due it faced the closed backyard. Housekeeping was very attentive and tidied up perfectly. Staff and Concierge did a good job.
265,1912,"Jul 16 2008 	Excellent and disappointing	Having read the rave reviews we decided to stay here for my birthday trip to New York. I looked it up on the internet and found a special deal for a Chic Picnic. Basically the fourth night was free, the room was superior and we received a picnic hamper with wine or champagne. The first down fall was the pricing. According to my reservation our final bill would show the full amount and then have a 25% discount. I therefore took the quoted amount to be the full amount and applied 25% discount. Not so we discovered on our first night. The quoted was with the discount so the cost was 33% higher than I budgeted. Maybe this is me being daft but I have reread my booking and it is still unclear. Eventually we got checked in and went to our room on the 19th floor. The view was breathtaking, the bed wonderfully soft, there was a plasma screen TV and a bottle of champagne for my birthday. However the &quot;big marble bath&quot; was barely big enough for me at 5'4&quot;. We asked for our chic picnic on the second day and it came in a wonderful wooden hamper with a bottle of champagne. Unfortunately we were then told that we couldn't take the champagne to central park so that kind of ruined our &quot;champagne picnic&quot;. We left the champagne in the room and, on the advice of the concierge, walked to Central Park carrying the hamper. Do not be tempted to do this. Take a taxi. It will cost all of $6 and you will arrive fresh and unharried. On our last evening we requested a wake up call as we had to be at the airport by 6.30. We never received a call but luckily woke up in time. Checkout took forever as we had to use two seperate cards. Overall it was wonderful and disappointing all at the same time so I've marked it average."
266,1912,"Jul 15 2008 	Nice hotel great location	Just returned from a week-long New York/Chicago trip -- I love the Chicago Sofitel, so we thought we'd try the Sofitel in New York. And we weren't disappointed! Same amazingly comfy bed, nice flat-screen TV, and a lovely and very clean bathroom. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The standard rooms are pretty small, but since we were only in the room to sleep, it wasn't a big issue. My only complaint would be the one small window in the room, which barely let in any light -- this was probably because we had a room in the back of the building, with a less-than-desirable view of the alleyway between other buildings. But again, since we were only in the room to sleep, it wasn't a major problem. Valet service is slow, but it does say to call for your car 30 minutes ahead of time on the claim ticket -- and I would definitely recommend calling the full 30 minutes ahead of time, especially if you know you'll be in a hurry (like if you're heading back to the airport). We had to rent a car for a day to drive into New Jersey, but the first few days in the city we didn't need a car at all -- the hotel is in such a great location that walking just about anywhere is the best way to go. Plenty of shops, restaurants, etc. within a few blocks -- Central Park is pretty close, and Grand Central Station is just down the street. We took the subway to Yankee Stadium for a game, which was about a hundred times easier than trying to drive there. And the hotel is a couple blocks away from the craziness of Times Square, so it's in a much quieter location. We really enjoyed the hotel -- I would definitely recommend it!"
267,1912,"Jul 12 2008 	Best Birthday Ever!	It took me 2 weeks to decide on a hotel since New York has so many and I am very happy with the decision I made.I stayed at the Sofitel for my 30th birthday during the 4th of July weekend. This was my first trip to New York by myself and the staff went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. The room was larger than expected, clean, large flat screen t.v and the bathroom was amazing. I never saw the cleaning staff, but my room was cleaned every day and they provide turn down service every night. I stayed on the 19th floor and was able to see the Empire State building from my room. They have free internet in the lobby (if you don't mind waiting to use the computers) and the location of the hotel is perfect since Times Square is right there. I am going to New York again next year and will be staying in the Sofitel. Overall wonderful experience, fabulous hotel and I would like to thank the staff for making it the best birthday ever!"
268,1912,"Jul 11 2008 	A really fantastic hotel in so many ways!	In recent years I have become very familiar with trip advisor and use it to decide on where I should stay when I travel. I have found it to be invaluable tool and It has helped me make very good decisions. Again recently this June, it did not let me down, so I thought it was about time I wrote a review!! I went to New York with a few friends(some very fussy!). We stead in the Sofitel New York and It did not disappoint. I couldnt recommend it enough. Everything about this hotel was just fantastic. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very spacious and the beds were to dye for. The hotel had a lovely bar and restaurant with a beautiful decor and atmosphere. On evenings when something casual was required the bar menu was lovely. In the lobby there was internet access with printers which was really handy. The location was excellant with every thing on its doorstep. The most impressive find was a diner a few doors down &quot; red flame&quot; which served the nicest breackfast each morning for roughly $12 each. Overall a great hotel which even impressed the fussy ones and I certainly will stay there on my return to the big apple!"
269,1912,"Jul 5 2008 	Great Hotel to use for Visiting New York	This review is a bit late, sorry, my partner and I stayed here late Nov07, Thanksgiving Weekend. I can say that we had great service from the hotel and the staff were really helpful as this was our first time visiting New York. Which brings me to another great thing about the hotel is its location. Right between two of the busiest Avenues in New York, with easy walking distance of all of Central Manhattans major attractions. The street the hotel is on, is quiet for a New York street, with is great to take a break form the surrounding streets constant hustle. I also recommend that when you visit New York is to get a room as high as possible in any hotel you stay at to avoid the street noise and constant taxi honking to get a good night sleep! Also the Sofitel privilege card is a great idea to get to benefit from a late check out as well and its free!The Red Flame dinner is ok and cheap, but not the best. Theres a great little breakfast / caf shop out the back of the hotel (use the hotel bar exit), on the opposite side of the street, heading toward 5th Ave. Cant remember the name but it sells fresh fruit etc, cheaper than the Red Flame dinner and it less hectic."
270,1912,"Jul 3 2008 	Not worth the money	Stayed for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon in June. There was nothing wrong with it, but really for the money we paid it was a bog standard hotel. The bed was very very comfortable and the bathroom lovely. The room wasn't particularly big. We had a big flat screen TV though which was nice. We were on 7th floor and had no views. It was booked as part of a honeymoon package and although we weren't looking for freebies, an acknowledgement would have been nice! I have read other reviews about upgrades or a bottle of wine as special occaision touch - but nothing.There was a big storm the night before we left and JFK had been closed - I called the concierge about 11.30 to see if they thought the morning flights would be okay and I was dismissed by them - they didn't seem interested.We had rather a strange experience on our last night where the phone range about 1am and it sounded like some sort of taxi booking place confiming something for our room. I hung up as I couldn't work out what was going on - half an hour later, room service appeared at our door. We had to get up at 5.30am for a flight in the morning. They only sort of shrugged when I complained in the morning.The doormen were great though - v easy to get a taxi and provided umbrellas when it was raining. They also recommdend a great pizza place - John's pizza on same street but just past broadway - would highly recommend it. The red flame diner just out the front door on the left was also good for breakfast. We spent a bit of time in an Irish Bar nearby - O'Briens which was great - food was fab and staff really friendly."
271,1912,"Jul 1 2008 	Special Break in a good hotel	A Hotel that lives up to its reviews, rooms were clean and serviced twice a day and had no problems, the bed is one of the best I have ever slept in. This trip was for 8 days for our silver wedding aniversary and whilst we were given a room on the 19TH floor the free champagne enjoyed by others never arrived even though they were advised. Free internet access in lounge was great, reception helpful and efficient, doorman good, bell boys to busy chatting most of the time. One of the conseirge team was a little up himself but generally good.The hotel is expensive even on a deal but well worth it as room was a good size and bathroom was what europeans expect, nice and big and seperate shower was excellent. Lots of hot water all the time.Did not try the Red Flame as there are lots of places to have breakfast, Grand Central is worth it for one morning and its just 2 blocks away. Another favourite was Cuttichines at the Rockerfella Centre for those who want a healthier option.If you do Staten Island Ferry make sure you are on the right hand side or front or end otherwise you miss the statue of LibTips, do Brooklyn Bridge at Night the views are unforgettable, do top of the Rock as that way you can photograph empite state building, however disappointed with evening views as we did a dawn and dust ticket. Dinner between 6 &amp; 8 is hectic and for lunch try one of the deli's by Bryant Park and sit in the park and watch the world go by."
272,1912,"Jun 29 2008 	An absolute must!	We stayed at the Sofitel from the 11th to the 16th June 2008 and loved the hotel to bits! The hotel location is excellent, in a safe neighbourhood close to absolutely everything! We stayed at the hotel having booked under the chic picnic rate which got us 4 nights for the price of 3 and a picnic hamper with great food and wine, contained in a fab picnic hamper that we took to central park and devoured in the sun! The hotel staff are fantastic, taking their time to answer any questions or queries. They made us feel like individuals in what must be a busy, large hotel. Used the gym which was well equiped with the latest machines and had weights etc to use. the room was on the 17th floor, no fantastic views but the bed was very comfortable, the room service menu and staff alike were fab and very polite. Huge bathroom with seperate bath and shower. Turn down service was great, free bottled mineral water every evening. On the whole, a great experience in New York and I would definately stay at the hotel again should I return to the Big Apple. Thanks Sofitel for making our stay such a good, memorable one!"
273,1912,"Jun 27 2008 	I really like this hotel	The Sofitel is my favorite hotel to stay at in New York whether for business or pleasure. There are surely fancier and more expensive hotels at tonier addresses, but the Sofitel is certainly no slouch. And it is consistently quiet, comfortable, and convenient. Last weekend, I stayed at the Sofitel for the first time ifor pleasure with my wife. I had stayed their previously for business probably 10 times over the last 3 years. The lobby at the Sofitel is small and luxurious. You get the feel of a small hotel although the Sofitel is actually quite large. When I arrived last Friday it was bustling a little more than I remembered but was still relatively quiet. When I checked in at the desk, I was informed my room was on the third floor, which I somewhat expected given the price and category I paid for. When I asked if there was another room on another floor, I was told there was not one in the same category. That did not suprise me because I already knew the hotel was sold out. But what did suprise me was that I was offered a suite for a $100 upgrade on a high floor.Our suite was beautiful with an excellent view of the city. The bedroom and bathroom were virtually identical to a deluxe king room (I had booked a queen room) but you had the addition of a separate sitting room with a large flatscreen tv and desk. As usual the service at the hotel was attentive but understated. We used the concierge several times and they were always helpful. I thought the staff was very friendly. The only meal we ate at the hotel this trip was a quick early dinner one night on the way back to the airport. I had no complaints with the service or food. I have always found the restaurant in the hotel to be a step above most hotel restaurants.We did go to the Red Flame diner down the street for breakfast one morning. It was fine, nothing to write home about. It is a good cheap diner. We also went down the street to one of my favorite sushi restaurants, Sush Zen. Really exceptional sushi and sashimi, and less than two blocks from the Sofitel. Sit at the sushi bar. Very expensive, but worth it. You should be aware that for reasons I don't understand (or maybe I do) they don't air condition the hallways in the guest room floors. In the heat of the summer that can create some concern as you are taking the short walk from the elevators to your room. But don't worry, the guest rooms and lobby stay plenty cool. I had been telling my wife about the Sofitel for some time. I think after this trip she understands why I prefer to stay there over some other high end hotels. It is simply comfortable and you can't beat the convenience."
274,1912,"Jun 25 2008 	Served it's purpose very well...	I stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend for a 4 night weekend break. We had high hopes for the hotel based on reviews on here and other sites. It isn't the cheapest hotel in Manhattan and is rated 4 star so we did expect it to be nice.Overall I think it does live up to its rating, it is a pleasant hotel, reception staff were very friendly, rooms were large with nice decor, and the beds were comfy, so to be honest, it does exactly what you want for a few days in New York. We were only on floor 7 so had no decent views. Maybe we should have asked at check in for a higher floor??The only thing that did disappoint me slightly was the concierge. Maybe the guy I encountered was the worst of a good bunch and isnt doing them any favours. Hopefully he wasn't typical of their concierge service on the whole. To me the concierge should probably be the most friendly and helpful person on the staff. My understanding of their job is to help hotel guests in any way they can. My two approaches to the concierge desk lasted a grand total of about 15 seconds as I was pretty much brushed aside by a man that I would describe as having, pardon my french, a stick up his backside. He couldn't have been less helpful if he tried!We didnt eat in the restaurant so cannot comment on that at all but it seemed quite expensive.I shouldnt let the concierge cloud my judgement of the hotel, overall it was a great trip, the location wa fantastic, a hundred yards from times square and the 5th Ave shops and a lot niceer than the place I stayed last time in NYC! I would definately return and would recommend to friends."
275,1912,"Jun 22 2008 	C'est bon!	This is luxury. We usually stay at the Michaelangelo Hotel, which is also a wonderful property, but sold out -- so we tried the Sofitel. Wow! Our mantra is that a great staff makes a great.hotel. And this staff is among the best. We couldn't have felt more welcome. Our room met all of our expectations, (and we can be nastily picky.) We upgraded to an Executive Suite on the 28th floor. The room was well appointed and quiet as a mouse. The bathroom was hugh, beautiful and very usable (nice deep soaking tub for one, separate glass shower.) The bar/bistro was pricey, but worth it. We made dinner at the bar one night from the appetizer menu (not just wings and fried cheese sticks.) During a torrential downpour Steve waved his arm at cabs until his arm was empty, at that point we discovered the joy of the bicycle taxis (rickshaws). What fun and what great young men, impossibily polite, hardworking and owners of their own small businesses. While darting in and out of traffic, staying dry because our driver buttoned us up behind a plastic curtain (while getting wet himself), we enjoyed every minute (not for the faint of heart.) Sofitel NYC, if you guys are listening, great job. You too, rickshaw guys. Both of you are gracious and that's a rare quality,"
276,1912,"Jun 22 2008 	Great Stay	After review other hotels, we decided to try the Sofitel. We were amazed on our early arrival how quickly they had a room available for us! The hotel staff was wonderful! Great staff working there. We did not eat in the hotel since the prices were expensive and plenty to chose from outside the hotel.We truly enjoyed having a seperate shower from the bathtub! and the little things that came along with the room! Seems like made service was great! They took care of us even on our day of departure! The Hotel is in a great location off the beaten path of Time Square but it is a easy walk to many areas! Truly enjoyed this hotel over others!"
277,1912,"Jun 18 2008 	This one's a keeper	I've stayed in a number of midtown hotels during the past year, and the Sofitel is definitely one I'll use again. It's one of the quietest hotels I've stayed in. You don't hear much outside noise at all, even in the lobby and restaurant. Definitely try to stay on one of the higher floors for the views. My room, on the 18th floor, wasn't very large, but it had a floor-to-ceiling window, and I had a hard time tearing myself away. Rooms have been recently refurbished, and they're clean and elegant. The staff are a teeny bit on the frosty side, but very professional, informed, and helpful.If you need to check e-mail but didn't bring your laptop, the lobby has several terminals you can use for free.Overall, the Sofitel is good value for money, given its location, amenities, and quality of service."
278,1912,"Jun 17 2008 	Fine but not as good as others	Sofitels are generally great. This one was good. The location is also a big plus point. The staff were excellent - very, helpful and very friendly. They allowed us to check in about 6 hours early and couldn't have been more helpful with luggage, directions and advice.The room was a good size and had a separate shower and bath but was not quite the size that I was led to believe from the hotel's description. I guess 'large marble bath' may mean something different in New York. The bed was terrific - they always are in these hotels. But the decor was a bit bland. Free internet access downstairs was a real plus. The bar was expensive and the service wasn't that great. We had breakfast one morning but again I found that expensive and the service wasn't that great."
279,1912,"Jun 11 2008 	Great Hotel!!!!	This Hotel was Amazing. Great location, walking distance to time square. Very clean, not to mention the amazing lobby. We got chocolates and water in our room everyday. The conciere service was a big help. I absoutely would recommend stay here. I haven't traveled in a while and originally booked another hotel and read others reviews which astounded me. The website made the hotel look amazing which really was a nightmare to the testimony of others. That's why I was going to make sure I did a review. Thanks to those who wrote a review I did not stay there and found the Sofitel hotel. Which I was very happy with."
280,1912,"Jun 7 2008 	Comfortable and dependable	This was our third stay at this Sofitel hotel which enjoys a perfect location between 5th Avenue and Broadway - close to everything but away from the noise and confusion of Times Square. We stayed one week. The first morning, offensive cooking odors from a restaurant that was not affiliated with the hotel entered the room. We spoke with the hotel manager who promptly moved us to a higher floor and an ungraded room for the rest of our stay. Both rooms were well furnished and in the condition one would expect for a quality property. The beds were very comfortable with high quality linens and down comforters and pillows. Since our last stay, the hotel rooms have been furnished with large flat screen HD televisions. The staff met our expectations in every way. We certainly would and intend to return."
281,1912,"Jun 4 2008 	OK 4 Star in a good location	Stayed here memorial weekend (May 22-27th 2008). The hotel was in a good location - W44th is close to everything. It is a few blocks from Bryant Park, and also from Time Square and theatres.Hotel is clean and the staff friendly and helpful. Although this is a four star hotel and its facilities do reflect this it is not in the same league as my last stay in New York at The Michelangelo."
282,1912,"Jun 4 2008	Excellence of the Sofitel	We stayed at the Sofitel for a long weekend just gone and had a great time. We booked direct via the hotel and got a fantastic rate ~ $350 per night which couldn't be matched by any of the usual websites.The location is superb being in the centre of things. The rooms were a reasonable size especially for New York, we stayed in a standard Queen double, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was well fitted. Rooms were cleaned twice a day to a very high standard. We were on the 10th floor which while there was no view really to speak of was nice and quiet.The concierge service was incredible, specifically Vladimir who managed to get us into some of the best restaurants even though it was peak time at the weekend. He even went as far to organise a complimentary glass of champagne for the 2 of us at one of the restaurants.Drinks are expensive in the hotel, which I guess is standard but I think a little unnecessary and would love one of the higher standard hotels to start breaking the mould, certainly it would result in having a more popular bar and restaurant which were very quiet during our stay, although we did not bother with eating in the hotel.Overall excellent service, good standard of room (especially considering it was New York), and fantastic location."
283,1912,"Jun 3 2008 	I just love this hotel	You simply cannot go wrong with this hotel. It was my 30th birthday and 8 of us went to NYC. The location of the hotel is spot on no where is too far. The reception staff were helpful and friendly, the doormen were very helpful with arranging transport, the consierge was very useful I could not fault the staff. The hotel is beautiful and the beds amazing. I simply cannot say enough good things. Make aure you go to the red flame for breakfast is on the corner of the street the hotel is on and does great breakfasts for a very good price.The hotel made sure all of my party were on the same floor and sent complimentary champagne to me on the day of my birthday.The rooms are immaculate and cleaned twice a day.I will always stay here."
284,1912,"Jun 3 2008 	What more could you ask for??	I booked this hotel solely based on its reviews (and ranking) on Tripadvisor. I have to admit that it is a bit pricey, but so are most of the hotels in New York. On arrival I felt that the hotel was totally overrated and was disappointed. However, as time went by I started to notice what made the hotel so highly ranked and I have to admit that it is well deserved. It is the little details that matter Location of the hotel is excellent. It is on the 44th street just few hundred meters off the 5th avenue. You can also easily walk to Times Square, Bryant Park and Grand Central just to name a few. There are nice restaurants within a few blocks of the hotel.The room was really comfortable and spotless. It had a flat screen TV, adequate minibar, safe, iron and board etc. Bed was pretty much the softest and nicest Ive ever slept in. Although I could hear some sounds from the hall, it was quiet enough. Bathroom was large (and like the room - spotless) with a separate shower and a tub. There is a turn-down service each evening with a bottle of Evian water delivered. The one thing that really separates this hotel from other business hotels is the staff (after all, money can buy you nice surroundings). They seem to like their job and act accordingly. They were easy to approach, extremely friendly and made me feel welcome. The concierge service was excellent  very helpful and correct in their suggestions. Breakfast is served every morning in the Hotel restaurant. I was really looking forward to a buffet breakfast as the start for the day, but it turned out only a la carte is available. There are a number of items you can order. These cost around 22  35 USD (+ tax)and include fresh juice and a pot of (good) coffee. The continental breakfast is a basket of French bakery products (croissant, bread, muffin etc) and a fruit plate. The fruit plate was rather small, with 5 small slices of 2 kinds of melon and pineapple. It was so small it made me laugh as I saw it. If it isn't included in the room price or your company isnt paying for it, I would go somewhere else for breakfast. If I had to say something negative, I would mention that like some others before me I didnt receive a welcome drink although Im a Sofitel Privilege member (minor detail, but just to bring it up). On a positive note a late check-out was granted without a problem. Overall, Sofitel New York is a wonderful hotel with a perfect location. I would definitely stay there again."
285,1912,"Jun 3 2008 	Fabulous Sofitel Stay!	I did extensive research and settled on this hotel. Wonderful experience! The staff was great and helpful! They sent us to fabulous restaurants, gave us umbrellas when it rained, gave us complimentary wine. Very clean and the beds were dreamy. Great location. We will go back!"
286,1912,"May 30 2008 	Very nice hotel great position	My wife and I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. Overall, the hotel is very nice, fantastic location, just few minutes by walk from several &quot;must see and be&quot; locations like Times Square, Rockefeller center, Public library, Madison Square, Penn Station etc. Also, Empire State Building and Macys are just 10 streets away. We recommend this hotel not just because of great location. Rooms are large enough, bed fantastic, lobby area luxury and staff is very pleasant and helpful."
287,1912,"May 30 2008 	Generally good but a couple of problems	Stayed here for a few days on a work trip. Booked direct with the hotel, paying around US$600/night. In general, this hotel is pretty good, but there were just a couple of minor problems. Good stuff first:-The beds are very comfortable; good linens and towels. -Rooms are geniunely very quiet; I didn't hear any noise from the corridor or nighbouring rooms in my entire stay, which is rare for New York.-Good room size.-Food (room service and restaurant) was fine.-Concierge was great (they got us a table at Restaurant Daniel with only a few hours notice). Not so good:-I paid for a supposedly deluxe room on the 15th-29th floor with city view etc, but instead was allocated a random standard room on the 4th floor looking onto a wall. I know that hotels overbook etc, but they didn't apologise or offer to move me. When I requested an alternative room, nothing was available. Not a major upset, but slightly annoying. -Bellhop service isn't great. It took ages for anyone on front desk to call a porter to help with luggage when I was checking out. When they did eventually call for someone (using a xylophone ?), no one came. In the end I stopped a random hotel employee and they had to help carry my stuff. Other stuff:-A few reviews have raved about the bathrooms. They're fine, really, but nothing out of this world. The bathtubs, by the way, are fairly shallow, like many other American hotels. -The gym/fitness room is alright. Small like most hotels, and without a great choice of free weights, but at least clean and fairly well equipped.-Some of the other reviews have recommended visiting the &quot;Red Flame&quot; diner. Seriously, don't go - yes it's a diner, but it's one of the depressing sort. I went for a turkey burger and left most of it - overly greasy and processed, and just very unappetising. A much better option is the Comfort Diner, which is a few minutes away on East 45th Street and 3rd (or E 45th and Lexington, I can't remember). It looks like how you might expect a 50s-type diner to look, but isn't overly retro. Overall, a good choice for New York, not exactly what I'd call &quot;Luuxry Choice&quot;, but I think for the money it's pretty good. I think for a real luxury choice, you'll have to spend a couple hundred more dollars."
288,1912,"May 30 2008 	Some Superlatives For Sofitel	As with so many previous reviews, I've no complaints with this Hotel. We booked this Hotel on the strength of the feedback from these Trip Advisor comments. I have to say the Hotel did not disappoint. This is a very comfotable Hotel with all the amenities required for our stay here. A standard room for 4 nights provided us with a room on the 11th floor with a view of 45th Street at the rear of the hotel. The spacious air conditioned triple glazed room had a large LCD TV , Mini Bar , iron and ironing board. Free room safe and even a small U.S. plug adaptor ( great detail ) . A large bathroom gave us a small bath and walk in shower. If I had a criticism the water pressure in the shower was what I can only describe as lack lustre. Never-the-less a very nice place to return to after the Manhattan Mayhem. As we'd booked room only we like others, found ourselves at the Red Flame Diner, just a couple of doors down on 44th St. Happy Days meets The Whistle Stop Cafe for mammoth cholesterol busting breakfasts. Great , but by day three we found ourselves defeated, when cereal and fruit were begging us back to save our health ! Just a bit further along on 44th homesick Scots can grab a bite to eat New York style at St Andrews Bar 120 W 44th where we had a very hearty lunch on our last day.The main attraction for this Hotel is the location, you're convenient for everything here and having previously visited &amp; stayed in New York .I would recommend this area for your stay. Overall a great comfortable Hotel in a fabulous location......Enjoy !"
289,1912,May 28 2008 	What A Place	We had read the reviews on here and decided to go for it for our very first stay in NYC. What a great hotel - the beds are simply amazing - especially after youve had that long walk - its like falling asleep in a cloud. The staff where kind and courteous. One thing I will say is if you dont ask you dont get. We got put on the 15th floor which I thought was a bit rubbish as its the minimum floor for paying extra for a higher floor - so we asked and where moved to floor 27. The door staff where brilliant and the maids come twice a day to clean the room and then a second visit later ont o turn the beds over.A great hotel - well worth the extra to have a haven in NYC.
290,1912,"May 26 2008 	Loved staying at Sofitel	We stayed at the Sofitel from May 10-15th. The location is wonderful! It is very close to Times Square, Grand Central, Empire State, Rockefeller Center and so many other attractions. The hotel is beautiful. We stayed in a room with a queen bed on the 14th floor. The room is a decent size, especially in NYC, complete with robes and slippers to lounge in. The bathroom is huge!! I would definitely recommend staying at the Sofitel &amp; would go back in a heartbeat on our next visit to NYC."
291,1912,"May 21 2008 	Great hotel highly recommended	We stayed at the Sofitel from April 30 till May 5 and we absolutely loved it. Having never visited New York and given the number of hotels in the city, my husband and I felt it was very difficult to choose. Eventually, we decided to try the Sofitel, because of the location and the good reviews we read on this site. We arrived late in the evening, we had no problem with the check in and our room felt warm and cozy. It was on the 23rd floor and we had a view of the Chrysler building. The bathroom was really nice, one of the best ever seen in a hotel. The bed very comfortable, the room nice and clean. We had breakfast in the hotel twice and we absolutely loved it. We also had room service and there again everything was excellent. In the lobby there is a little internet room which can be used by hotel guests (very handy, when you're in vacation and don't carry your laptop with you). The location is perfect: most interesting sights are within walking distance (Grand Central Station, Times Square, Fifth Avenue..) I just loved every minute I spent there."
292,1912,"May 14 2008 	Lovely stay	Stayed at the Sofitel Midtown and enjoyed very comfortable quiet rooms with a great selection of the latest release movies (Great for those early morning wake ups coming from Europe!).The location was fine with a short walk to Time Square, Grand Central and the the classic American shopping on 5th Avenue."
293,1912,"May 12 2008 	Absolutely Brilliant	This is pure luxury in the middle of New York. I stayed in suite 622. The suite has a big living room, beautiful bedding, 2 plasma screens , a full dressing room and high quality fittings throughout. The room makes you feel like royalty. The dining was excellent for breakfast - coffee was spot on, the food was wonderfully prepared and the service was timely and friendly. The location is perfect for all of the usual suspects in New York. The gym is well equipped and private. The concierge was knowledgeable, accommodating and extremely helpful. I could not think of a better place to stay."
294,1912,"May 2 2008	Highly recommend this hotel	We stayed 9 nights at this wonderful hotel based on the reviews from this site. The bottom line is that this is a great hotel and would stay there again. There was only one issue and it was a small one but you could hear the doors close of other rooms through the door of our room. Quite often it sounded like somebody coming into our room when actually it was somebody else closing or opening their door.Other than that:* it was very clean. Definitely a 4+ star equivalent in AU standards* staff were excellent, friendly and nice at all times* the location was brilliant. We spent 9 days in Manhattan and walked several kms everyday and saw many other hotels and we went back to the hotel every night happy we stayed here. The one thing that we were so glad about is the location. Its literally near everything including 5th Ave, Grand Central station, Times square, etc etc. We are only talking a couple of hundred meters away to these spots. The subway was interesting but safe however you could catch a cab from the hotel to Greenwhich Village for under $10 and to the financial district for not much more. Its also next door to the NY yacht club which some people may remember was the HQ for the America's cup. There are a couple of nice restaurants next door and there is also the diner a couple of doors up which we would sometimes get takeaway and crash in our room. We were upgraded to the 27th floor (there are 29 floors) and had a great view of the Chrysler Building 24/7. Lastly we weren't sure as to whether to get breakfast there or not and we were glad we didn't because the food in NY is unbelievable and there is so much within walking distance of the hotel. I would quite often go around the corner on 5th Ave into Barnes &amp; Noble bookshop and have breakfast overlooking 5th Ave in the starbucks on the 2nd or 3rd floor."
295,1912,"Apr 30 2008 	Amazing hotel - great location...	Had an amazing stay here for three nights. We were given a free upgrade to a lovely room on the 23rd floor. From the window you could see the Chrysler building and the Empire State. Location was perfect - 200 yards from Times Square and just off fifth avenue. The staff did everything you could wish for. Lovely hotel, great room wonderful location - couldn't be better!Tip - for a cheap and filling breakfast try the Red Flame diner next door."
296,1912,"Apr 29 2008 	Good Location Helpful Staff	I reserved this room on Priceline.com. I was a little nervous about it, because I had never stayed in Manhattan and was unsure what to expect with details about parking, check-in etc. As soon as the hotel accepted my offer I called the hotel. They were fantastic! They allowed me to request a king bed and a non-smoking room (it is my experience with priceline that this is frequently a problem). But Sofitel was very accommodating. They also gave accurate information about check-in and parking. The room was well appointed and very clean. The location was nice, just blocks from Times Square. The only thing I was suprised about was that the halls and the lobby were extremely hot and humid. The staff- extremely friendly and helpful the entire stay. I would definetly stay again!"
297,1912,Apr 29 2008	Romantic GetAway	Great romanitic getway with my Wife. It is close to everything and the room service food is divine. I highly recommend for a couple wanting a romotic getaway.
298,1912,"Apr 29 2008 	Best location excellent hotel!	We stayed for 2 nights in April 08. They somewhat messed up our check-in (room was not ready), and we were immediately offered upgrade to an executive suite for next night (nice!). Staff was extremely helpful all the way. Rooms are very nice, and beds are simply incredible. Location is best in Manhattan - 5-10 min walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Penn Station."
299,1912,"Apr 28 2008	Great Location moderate hotel	Just stayed at the Hotel Sofitel for 5 days starting on 4/23. The front desk gave us a nice corner room with 2 oversized twin beds as I was traveling with a friend. The first thing I noticed was the rather warm temperature in the room which did not cool down. After about an hour we called maintenance and a very nice gentleman came and removed an extremely filthy air filer and replaced it. Still we sweated all night long in about 78 degrees. When I tried to remove the heavy comforter I realized there was no top sheet and was grossed out about the idea of sharing a comforter with 1000 other people. In the morning I contacted the front desk manager and when we returned to the hotel later that afternoon the A/C was working fine and a top sheet had been put on the beds. Also I went to put on a robe and the previous persons hair was all over it, I put it in the hallway... The hotel reeks of popourri and all hallways seem to not be air conditioned. There is a nice bar and the location is great with the Algonquin and the Iroques all in a row. There is a fabulous resturant Killari right down the street, the food was so good that we ate there twice. Very fresh grilled fish, wonderful beet and walnut salad. The very hip Morgan Hotel and M Bar are right across the street. You can walk to Saks Fifth Avenue easily. The staff and especially Brook the concerierge was wonderful and couldn't be more accomodating, that being said I would sum up the experience as an okay business hotel with lots of europeans staying there. I would probably not stay there again."
300,1912,"Apr 24 2008 	Pleasant Stay	I stayed at this hotel for a short sightseeing trip. It was a pleasant stay, and I have nothing to complain about. The room was a little on the small side, but that is to be expected from New York. Bed was comfortable, room was clean and tastefully decorated with air conditioning. The hotel location was perfect - between fourth and fifth avenue and on a street with several other hotels that felt safe. Just a couple of blocks away from Times Square in one direction and Grand Central Station in the other, so a perfect location for sight seeing. The concierge was friendly and a big help and booked tickets, had taxis flagged down for us, and gave us general information that we found useful. I'd stay there again."
301,1912,"Apr 23 2008 	Amazing hotel fantastic location	My girlfriend and I stayed in the Sofitel in late Jan 2008.It was an extra special weekend away because I was planning to propose to my girlfriend. I'd phoned ahead and the Sofitel had upgraded us to a suite with no extra charge... result!The hotel itself is amazing. Great rooms, staff (v. knowledgeable concierge) and if you want to be central NYC you cannot beat the location. You're slap bang in the middle of everything.I would thorougly recommend this hotel to anyone hitting New York for the first time. It made our weekend effortless.Over the weekend my girlfriend turned into my fianc!!!"
302,1912,"Apr 22 2008 	perfect	we just got back from this trip i am not into all this computer stuff but my sister lives in the states and is forever saying to check tripadvisor before booking read reviews on this hotel and can only thank my sister and the people who put there coments on this site hotel is in a great spot 2 blocks east of times sq next to grand central 1block east radio city 3 blocks north madison sq and maceys 10 south central park 13 north .hotel it&quot;s self is 1 of the best i have stayed in did not eat there very dear food and drink service great though red flame dinner 200 yards from hotel great breakfast and st andrews scottish bar 250 yards has great food steak ,sea food well worth a visit. this city is great i spent a fair bit of time in states in the past this is great thanks to sofitel"
303,1912,"Apr 22 2008 	Didn't even get past reservations	I called the Sofitel for a 3 night stay in May - reservations were helpful and a room was booked - I was asked for a cc to guarantee my room so gave over my number. A couple of days later I checked my bank account to find it was lighter by nearly 400.I called back the Sofitel and explained I had authorised a holding guarantee but not a deposit and at no time was this mentioned to me. Furthermore this was for a special celebration and my husband would be settling the bill, and the holding card is my account.I was met with I must have called central reservations - which I hadn't - then apparently I must have been redirected to a call centre - what difference does that make - I was asked for a guarantee card not a deposit card.I cancelled my room as I really object to people charged my card when not authorised. The money was refunding back onto my card but due to the charge in exchange rate I am still 17 lighter for a transaction I didn't authorise.Thanks Sofitel fantastic 30th birthday present!"
304,1912,"Apr 21 2008 	Best Hotel in NYC	We stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed every night in the hotel. The staff was the best. With very early check-in I was amazed they had a room available for us. To the knowledge of the staff and things to do! Rooms were clean and very well maintained! Great maid service.We did not eat in the hotel, even though they offer great room service. Too busy with all the attractions and sites to see.They do offer smoking rooms for smokers and found that they do not smell of smoke as we have seen in other hotels.Great location and easy walk to many places to visit."
305,1912,"Apr 21 2008 	Great Comfortable stay	We enjoyed a comfortable stay at Sofitel, the staff were helpful and efficient.The room was lovely as was the bathroom. This was the first time we had been to New York so I am not sure if it was a little expensive for that type of room, but I had nothing to complain about.The only thing was my boyfriend made two international calls which were a phenomenal price - maybe we were niave about how much hotel calls cost but I never thought it would be that much - so beware!!"
306,1912,"Apr 15 2008 	Amazing	I stayed last january, and I only can say positive things about this hotel.It's been a long time I don't sleep so comfortable in a hotel room, so great bed and pillows!Excellent location, grat staff."
307,1912,"Apr 14 2008 	Sofitel is superb!	We have just returned from a five night stay at the Sofitel and can honestly say that we cannot find fault with the hotel. It really is as good as all the reviews claim. We particularly appreciated the free internet access in the lobby, the cleanliness of the rooms and the great location, not to mention the free drink/late check out and upgraded room afforded by the Sofitel Privilege Card (see their website). When we return to NYC we will be staying at the Sofitel."
308,1912,"Apr 10 2008 	fantastic	could not fault this hotel, fab location, staff and service... will definitely stay there again"
309,1912,"Apr 9 2008 	Superb!	We stayed here en route from South Africa back home to the British Virgin Islands, with our daughters aged 5 mths and 3 1/2 years. Our expereince was superb!!! We arrived at the hotel at 8am in the morning (after a 19 hour overnight flight) and were amazed that the hotel made our room available to us. We had a suite and it was very comfortable and beautifully appointed. The service was superb and catered for our every need and as a bonus the location of the hotel was excellent. I can't say one bad thing about our experience."
310,1912,"Apr 9 2008 	5 star treatment at this classy hotel	Have just returned from the Sofitel Hotel, in New York to celebrate my birthday and what a fabulous experience we had. We received 5 star treatment from the moment we arrived at the airport. I had already booked a car via Concierge to collect us from the airport and they were there to meet us in arrivals. We enjoyed a pleasant journey to the hotel unlike on a previous occasion when we used a yellow cab! Check in was seamless and all staff we came across at this hotel were fantastic. My partner had phoned ahead and told them it was my birthday so they upgraded us to queen superior on 27th floor - great view of the Chrysler building from our room. You would never believe you were in the centre of the city as it was so quiet  a Very relaxing experience. About an hour after we arrived, a bottle of champagne arrived at our room for me, which was a very nice touch especially for a hotel of this size. The location of this hotel is great for getting around. A 5-minute walk to Times Square and Theatre land and 2 doors away is DB's restaurant, which everyone must try. The food and service is great. You need to book ahead for DB's as it is always heaving. We ate at The View (revolving restaurant at the Marriott Marquis) one evening and whilst the experience was good, the food was very average. Would not bother with that again. We had a predinner meal at Frankie and Jonnies Steak House which was alsoi good. This place was full and apparently has been there for years so has a great reputation for its steaks - worth a try. We also tried Tavern on the Green for Sunday brunch, which we nearly cancelled because of the reviews on here but glad we did go. Service was excellent and food good. It is no doubt a real tourist attraction for the city but you should give it a try.The Concierge 'crew' at this hotel are probably the best I have come across. They could not do enough for you. They even organised a hair appointment for me at this fabulous salon on 5th! The doormen are so attentive and one is made to feel very special. This is obviously an extremely well ran hotel and is a credit to the management as their high standards range from housekeeping staff all the way through. I became ill towards the end of our stay and they kindly organised a room for me so I could rest before we had to leave for the airport at no charge. I thought this was well and truly above and beyond expectations and really appreciated the kind gesture.I would recommend this hotel to everyone  its a fabulous place."
311,1912,"Apr 6 2008 	sofitel is fantastic	stayed in sofitel for 6 nights, best hotel i ever stayed in, absolute luxury, upgraded us to king size room after i emailed them a week before telling them we were on honeymoon, staff were so helpful and down to earth, lobby and bar are ultra cool and comfy, room was beautiful with large bath and shower and so quiet, location is perfect, next time we are in new york we will be staying here, no doubt!!!"
312,1912,"Apr 5 2008 	Wonderful!	From the doorman to the concierge and the front desk staff, this hotel was lovely. Room service was wonderful, even at 3 a.m. Albert at the front desk was so helpful and nice as was Rene the concierge. The food at the restaurant was delicious, the service very good. Our room was impecably clean, as was the bathroom. We have stayed there a few times, and would not even consider staying anywhere else. The location is fabulous, as well."
313,1912,"Apr 3 2008	New York's Sofitel Hotel -Understated chic	This hotel is excellent. It has an atmosphere of chic, understated luxury, from its art-deco lobby to its ultra-comfortable guest rooms. In the latter, everything has been taken of - even the most nit-picking guest would not be able to complain. The beds are supremely cosy and the all-marble bathrooms highly efficient. We had opted for a queen bedroom, but on arrival, decided that the bed might be a little small for my very tall husband. Our request for a twin-bedded room was dealt with courteously and immediately and no extra charge was made. Linen and towels were immaculate, the room was spotless and the chamber-maiding completely unobtrusive.All the staff provided a highly professional skilled service, not obsequious or fawning, but polite, friendly and accommodating. Faultless. The concierge was magnificent.This hotel is perfectly situated in the quiet west 44th street, within easy walking distance of Times Square, Broadway and 5th Avenue and is also within easy walking distance of Central Park, but, despite all these tourist attractions, the quietness of the hotel was a wonderful oasis to return to after a busy day.Breakfast at the hotel was expensive, so we decided to walk a few yards down the road to the fabulous Red Flame Diner, where breakfast was a sheer delight and something we looked forward to each morning.This was our first visit to New York. We shall certainly visit again and we shall certainly stay at The Sofitel. In fact, we shall certainly stay at other Sofitels in the world. The quality of the accommodation and the service is quite extraordinarily wonderful."
314,1912,"Apr 3 2008 	Brilliant!	This hotel, so close to Times Square and Broadway, is brilliant! I booked it after reading other people's reviews and I was not disappointed. We stayed for 3 nights.We had booked one king and one double. Both rooms were very spacious and nicely decorated - with some lovely photography on the walls. From my room I could see the Empire State Building and, by craning my head slightly, the Chrysler! The beds are FANTASTIC and have a lovely soft under duvet. Quiet air-conditioning and excellent double-glazing meant that the rooms were really quiet and relaxing. My kids were somewhat disappointed that I was supplied with free chocolates every night during turn-down service - but they were not! Evian water was also complimentary.Bathroom was a good size (it was so good to have a proper shower cubicle and separate tub) and spotlessly clean. Unfortunately the double wasn't quite ready when we checked in but it didn't cause a huge problem given that the king was available (so we were able to freshen up before embarking to the top of the Empire State Building). The staff on reception were pleasant (except for one rather haughty French woman) and efficient. The concierge are really good and clearly take pride in their work.The breakfast was expensive....but so good that it was worth every penny and set us up for the day. Staff were lovely - even when serving my two adolescent sons who were all kitted out in their death/heavy metal clothes! Next time I am in Manhattan I'm staying here again."
315,1912,"Apr 2 2008 	Simply the Best	Everything about this hotel was perfect, staff were very helpful,Food was pricey but excellent. Breakfast we had in the Red Flame ,out of the hotel turn right just a few doors up there was usually a queue but seated very quickly food good.Maid service twice a day, 2 bottles of water left every evening.There was even an ironing board and iron tucked away in wardrobe.I would recommend this hotel to everyone with no hesitation, it's so central to many of the sights New York has to offer."
316,1912,"Apr 2 2008	Loved the Sofitel!	Stayed at the Sofitel for 3 nights in March 2008. The hotel staff from front desk to housekeeping were very friendly and helpful. The rooms ( large by NYC standards) were very clean, tastefully decorated, and the bed was soooo comfortable! I have stayed in several NYC hotels like the W and Bryant Park, but now I will always come back to the Sofitel."
317,1912,"Apr 1 2008 	Comfiest beds in the world !	Just returned from a 4 day stay..4 girls who had left husbands and children behind for a weekend of shopping and self indulgence ! We could not have chosen a better hotel. Location is excellent, staff are fantastic ( Howard on reception, as our first contact, was a great ambassador for the hotel ). Complimentary coffee and tea in the morning ( not something I am used to seeing in a 5 star hotel ). Concierge made some great dinner recommendations. Despite it's 5 star rating, it did not feel 'snooty '. One day we walked in with Tiffany bags the next with bin bags from the market and we were treated no differently !I travel to New York, business and pleasure, about 4 times a year and can't believe I've not stayed here before..it really was 10 out of 10..and the beds are amazing...I will return."
318,1912,"Apr 1 2008 	Best option for this price	Located in the touristy area - 44th street - it is close to most attractions, the reception is friendly, the rooms very well appointed, the service fine, nothing very special but everything you can expect in a luxury hotel at a competitive price. It also has a nice French atmosphere. The food in room service is ok, the TV great, the bathrooms perfect.. If you are not looking for stiff luxury or fashionable places, it is the perfect choice."
319,1912,"Mar 31 2008 	Love this Hotel	We stayed here for two nights after a less than stellar stay at the Westin down the street. We got a good rate that included breakfast, and I signed up for the privilege card which gives you late checkout, and a free drink upon arrival. I didn't take advantage of either of those things, but they were nice if you had the opportunity to use them. All of the staff that we encountered were very helpful. I had reserved a queen bed for myself and my teenage daughter. We arrived before check in time. The front desk clerk said she could give us that room then, or if we could wait until 3 pm, she could give us a room with 2 twin beds. We jumped at that, so they held our bags, and we returned in the afternoon, wiped out from a day of walking and walking to the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in. It was like sleeping in a cloud. The bathroom was large, with huge soft white fluffy towels, and lots of fun extras, such as a candle, and teeth whitening mints. The tub was deep, and nice to soak in before going out for the night. We had so much fun sleeping in on the comfy beds, we didn't partake of the included breakfast. The Red Flame Diner a couple of doors down was great for carryout when returning back to the room from a show. This was my first time staying at a Sofitel, and hopefully not the last."
320,1912,"Mar 31 2008 	The Best Bed in the World	My partner and I stayed at the Sofitel for 3 nights in January this year after reading good things about it on TripAdvisor. We weren't disappointed. The hotel is excellent: luxurious, very friendly and with the best beds in the world - lie on one and you'll see what I mean.Probably the best endorsement I can give is that we have booked to stay there again in December for 4 nights."
321,1912,"Mar 29 2008	Great Hotel	Sofitel.The hotel kindly upgraded us to a King grand room, from a queen, as we were on our 25th anniversary. The hotel is on w44 st between 5th and 6 Ave. This is easy walking to Times Sq and shopping on 5th Av.The hotel is well laid out and the foyer is impressive. The rooms are very clean and have wonderful aspects. My daughter and partner claim their bed was the most comfortable they have ever slept in. The rooms were modern with all the facilities you would want.The restaurant is a bit pricey, but that is expected in a 4 star hotel, but the food was excellent and well worth the money.The rooms had maid service twice a day and they were  immaculate.All the staff were very friendly and the concierge could not do enough to help even when we were not using their contacts.I have just recommended the hotel to 2 friends who intend to go to NY next month and we will use it again."
322,1912,"Mar 28 2008 	Best Hotel in New York!!	We just returned from a 4-day stay in New York. I've stayed at the Hilton, Muse, Westin, Waldorf - but none can match the service, room, and location of the Sofitel. It's right between shopping on 5th Avenue and the theatre district. And the stretch of 44th street is relatively quiet compared to other hotel locations. There is a parking facility across the hotel, and diner down the block for a quick bite to eat. The amazing thing about this hotel is you never wait more than 5 seconds for an elevator, and the bathrooms are large and luxurious - glass shower and full sized tub, all in beautiful marble. Big but intimate lobby/sitting area with 3 computers and printer for no charge. The staff was very helpful, and the bell boy saved us $45 by helping us feed the meter for a few hours rather than paying another full day for parking. We got a great rate on Hotwire too, so, we know we got a great deal."
323,1912,"Mar 24 2008 	Superb Sofitel	Stay in this hotel, you will not be disappointed.The location is excellent, right in the centre of midtown Manhattan with 5th Ave and Times Square within a few yards.The room was great with a very comfortable bed, superb bathroom and good facilities.The staff were fantastic particularly the concierge and doormen. The concierge recommended two great restaurants, which they booked while we were there. Before we got there they arranged our helicopter trip and Broadway show. They could not be any more helpful.If we go back we will definitely be staying there again.Also, don't miss the Red Flame diner two doors down for breakfast, great value, great breakfast."
324,1912,"Mar 23 2008	Great hotel great location -- not cheap	I stayed at this hotel for a few days in December 2007 with a couple of family members. We were in a junior suite. As you know from the other reviews, there are a lot of pros to this hotel: - hotel is new, modern, renovated (which can't be said of all NYC hotels, even the good ones) - large (for New York) rooms - service is good - great views from the upper floors of the building - great location esp for first-time tourists to NYC (which my family members were). Walking distance to Theater District, 5th Avenue shopping and Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, pretty much everything from Central Park south through Midtown. - good nearby restaurants (including some in that same block)- a couple of other hotels just steps away, if you want a different ambiance. I'd particularly recommend the Algonquin for drinks in their old bar and the supper club performance. The biggest con to this hotel is price. It's not cheap -- we paid $950+/per night for the junior suite. Again that was in December, holiday season, so that's one of the most expensive times of the year. And those prices are in line with the other high-end hotels around the city at that time of the year. Other things that might be undesirable, depending on the individual traveler's preference: - this hotel does feel like a newer, modern style hotel. It doesn't have local charm; it's not atmospheric, old, or quirky. So for people who want local ambiance in their hotel, this isn't it. - it is in the big fat middle of the Midtown tourist and corporate zone. So if you want a neighborhood, &quot;where the locals live&quot; kind of location -- this isn't it. All that said -- our visit was perfect for what my family members were looking for, and the hotel was great for our needs."
325,1912,"Mar 16 2008 	Choose this Hotel can't go wrong	We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Sofitel. This is a GREAT hotel. Being our first trip to the Big Apple, the staff at Sofitel couldn't have made it any better. Check in took less than 2-3 minutes. The whole staff was very helpful and polite, always the first to say...good morning, good evening, can I help out in anyway, etc. The Hotel is very clean and well kept, we had a room on the 20th floor and had absoultely NO noise problems. The Bed, as already stated in previous reviews, is very comfortable which is always in need after a day full of walking. Nice LG flat screen TV with HD channels, which made it nice for NCAA championship weekend! If you have been going back and forth between this hotel and another, waste no more time and choose this one, you will not regret it! THE LOCATION is a great PLUS. It is Central to everything in Midtown, a couple of blocks from Time Square in one direction and 5th Avenue the other. The Red Flame is a nice breakfast spot that is only about a 2 minute walk from the door of the hotel. This being our first time to New York, we couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel. We will definitely stay here again when we return to New York City."
326,1912,"Mar 16 2008 	Great Service and location	Booked on hotwire.com and received a great deal for two nights at the end of January 2008. Location is a short three minute walk to Times Square and half a block walk to fifth ave shopping. We arrived at the Sofitel at 10:00 a.m. and was immediately given a room early. The room had a queen size bed and a great big bathroom. The bathroom was made from marble had a stand up shower and a seperate bath tub . There was also a 42 inch flat screen plasma tv in the room. The only down side to the room was the view of the air conditioner system outside but that didn't bother us as we were on the 3rd floor and wouldn't have a view anyways. The room was unbelievably clean and the bed was so comfortable and the duvets were amazing.The workout facility was great for a hotel. Had treadmills, stepper, and other cardio machines. Had free weights and weight machines as well. Was very clean and looked after. The bar/restaurant was beautifully decorated in french design and you felt quite at home in the big plushy chairs having a late evening drink. The staff at the Sofitel made us feel at home and we would recommend this hotel to anyone."
327,1912,"Mar 16 2008 	Great room and location	Stayed for 3 nights in a Queen room, city view and couldn't fault the well equipped room or location of the hotel. Had a slight problem with the a/con but other than that rooms are of a good size, include large flat screen tv if you spend that much time in the room, plus large bathroom. Our room 2217 was at the end of the corridor, so very quiet, with views of the Empire State building and Chrysler Centre. Hotel staff are very pleasant, although we asked for a late check out (4pm as per privilege card) but could only stay until 2pm due to the hotel being fully booked. Didn't try restaurant or bar in the hotel but can recommend 'The Red Flame' diner just 50 yds up the road, food &amp; service excellent and very reasonable.Would certainly stay at this hotel again."
328,1912,"Mar 13 2008 	Great hotel for theaters	Booked a room at theSofitel after seeing a promotion on travel zoo. The room rate of $245 was well worth it since it included breakfast and free Internet access. The hotel although fairly large does not seem it. Check in was fast and service great. There was a mixup on the promotion and Internet access, but the desk clerk said she would look into it. Minutes after getting to our room she was at the door with 2 free wireless time cards for use in the room. We booked this because we planned to go to the Theater. They are all 2 blocks away and within easy walking distance. If you go, be sure to make dinner reservations ahead of time. We ate at the Kellari Taverna which is right next to the hotel. Its even easy if you use the opentable.com website to book a reservation. Just search under Manhattan and theater district,"
1,1913,"I LOVE SOHO GRAND HOTEL!!! ;)	Hello there,I stayed at Soho Grand one time but it was a fantastic experience. The room was very noisy the first day so I asked to change the room and they gave me one at the 15th floor with great views. All staff was very nice and helpful so I left good tips ;) I am going back in January and have booked it again there.Relation quality - price: Excellent."
2,1913,"Nov 21 2009 	Nice hotel but beware the waitresses with 'attitude'	We stayed at the SoHo Grand for 3 nights. The hotel is well located for both downtown and midtown and various subway lines are close by. Overall the hotel lived up to expectations and we had a good stay. Just a couple of things which caused us some annoyance. Despite booking a deluxe king room which was advertised as being on the 8th floor or above, they tried to give us a room on the 4th floor with no reduction. After an hours wait in the bar they sorted out a room on the 16th floor which was fine. On the Saturday evening we bought a bottle of wine at the bar and then went to sit at a table (unreserved). After a few minutes a waitress came over and demanded to know where we had got the bottle of wine from, even though the bar was only six feet away. She then told us that all tables were reserved 'by the host' and we would have to move. Pointing out that we were in fact residents and had bought the bottle of wine ($58) from the bar made no difference. We stood at the bar and drunk our bottle whilst watching other people being subjected to the same attitude if they dared to sit down."
3,1913,"Nov 3 2009 	DO NOT STAY HERE	The actual hotel is great, however, we left a phone while we changing rooms due to it being very very noisy outside - the hotel kindly changed us to a room on the other side of the hotel which was a lot quieter. The phone was left charging for 5 minutes and when we called the hotel to get the phone they didn't call us back for a few hours then it was missing. Obviously stolen. The hotel have denied that it was stolen and have only reimbursed us the sum of the phone. This is my partners work phone and he lost a great deal of business from having the phone stolen. This matter was very poorly managed by the hotel and the customer service and chasing up of the matter was not what we expected from a hotel of this calibre."
4,1913,"Oct 23 2009 	Gone to the Dogs	I have stayed at the Soho Grand for approximately 6-years but after my last visit I won't be going back. Although the lobby bar and restaurant are great, and most of the staff are wonderful, my last experience was so disturbing I can't risk going back! Unfortunately my room, in particular the bed linen, was so dirty that it was a health hazzard.. The duvet was stained, and when I reached for the bed-side phone to call for help, I encountered an incredibly filthy bedside table. All-in-all a very disgusting experience and the hotel is definitely not to be recommended."
5,1913,"Oct 20 2009 	Nice location -- but...	If you want to enjoy Soho, great location. Rooms are very small. Price is high. And am coming off of two service flubs. First -- while tv is not the main thing, while on business I need to catch up on the news, and the cable wasn't working in my room. Front desk said they would send someone up. After 40 minutes, nobody came, so I gave up and went to bed. Then in the morning, had an early train to catch. Breakfast was supposed to be served at 6 a.m. Went down there at 6:15 a.m. and no waiters on hand. One of the busboys offered to give me some coffee while I waited. It was cold. Had time concerns and finally gave up. When I checked out at 7 -- looked very nice, but by then, I needed to go catch a train.It's sometimes the smaller things that convince a customer not to go back!"
6,1913,"Oct 19 2009 	convenience at the right price	I stay at either the Soho Grand or Tribeca Grand on almost every visit to New York. I must have stayed over 80 nights in the past 2 years. I have read some of the negative reviews. Yes, Its not faultless, but its a great place to stay, the staff are great, the food and bar great and its far less expensive than most of the luxury hotels in NYC."
7,1913,"Oct 12 2009 	Getting a little rough around the edges	I've stayed in this hotel alot over the years and have mixed service each time. I love the lobby and you can't beat the location, but the rooms have become a little grubby, and the service is often lazy and snooty. I've started to stay at 60 Thompson and Thompson LES instead. These hotels have less character, but the staff are much friendlier."
8,1913,"Sep 30 2009 	It's my favourite in New York	Just back from a 5 day business trip in New York and London. The Soho Grand is just GRAND on a cool street with SO helpful staff. If you like the Soho, Wall Street and bohemian life in the village its the only place to stay - although not cheap worth every dollar As a grand guest you even get a gold fish for company!. The bar buzzes in the evening and the rooms are great. Get one with a city view!"
9,1913,"Sep 17 2009 	Great Location and stylish	My wife and I noticed alot of reviews stating that the staff was rude or complacent. I was expecting a &quot;too cool for you, wannabee uptown attitude&quot;. Everyone I spoke with was very pleasant, helpful and gracious that was working in the hotel. We loved the location and the decor was very nice. Great atmosphere."
10,1913,"Sep 9 2009 	Great Hotel!!!	Really good hotel, location, staff, food etc.Only concern i have is the ugly carpet on the floors outside hotelroom in doorhall, the rom is not luxury rooms, but they are ok."
11,1913,"Sep 5 2009 	Great location good hotel	The New York office of my company recently moved to the Soho area, so this was my first time staying in Soho. I chose the Soho Grand because it seemed to be the nicest hotel close to work, but yet most reasonably priced.Upon arrival you must walk up about 6 to 8 stairs to reach the ground floor lobby area. No one was available to help me carry my bag up these stairs. Keep walking straight ahead to the elevators and go up one floor to reach the reception lobby area. Check in was fast and the man who waited on me was very nice. I thought the room size was fine. No, it's not big, but this is New York. The bed and bedding were very comfortable; the towels were nice. The bathroom was fine. All was clean. The Malin + Goetz toiletries were nice. There is a stocked mini-fridge. I didn't hear any room-to-room noise. The neighborhood is great. Tons of restaurants and shopping.My only complaints: you can hear the street and bar noise below but it's generally not too bad. The hairdryer in my room (1233) would only run for less than a minute before shutting off. I had to put it on top of the a/c and then resume drying. The water from the shower came out at a weird angle, hitting me about shoulder level -- and I'm only 5'4&quot;. This shower might be a problem for someone taller.I do plan to stay here whenever I'm in NY for business."
12,1913,"Sep 3 2009 	Love The Soho Grand	Okay, from the moment you walk in the door you know you have made the right choice.The hotel is ultra hip and the staff was fabulous. We travel a lot and we were not expecting how cool this hotel actually is. We started our night out in the city early and came back after dinner and chilled in the lounge until 2:00am. The music was SO great and we had so much fun in the lounge that we actually left the lounge when it was closed and went dancing until 5:30am! We had a great time at Soho Grand. We will definitely be back!"
13,1913,Sep 2 2009 	We loved it	Location great - Staff very helpful - Quiet (there was a wedding in the hotel that night) Clean Comfortable Can't wait to go back
14,1913,"Sep 2 2009 	Stay at the Tribeca Grand instead	This hotel is in a location and is really cool place, however the attitude of some of the staff is a disgrace. The lounge seats are often reserved and so after a busy day, if you want to sit and chill for a bit you often cant, and to make it worse when you ask the staff in the lounge they look at you as though you just spat in their face.I have previously stayed in the Tribeca Grand, their sister hotel, which has been fantastic. It is only a few minutes walk away to the south. Stay there instead."
15,1913,"Aug 23 2009 	Very nice	Everything you need: comfort, clean, high tech and good location"
16,1913,"Aug 23 2009 	Good location but missing something	Situated basically right in SOHO, you can't go wrong with the location. That being said, the rooms are small, the service isn't fantastic and there just seems to be something missing. I would probably go back if there was nothing else available, but this isn't the kind of place where you say 'we have to go back there'. not sure how else to put it, but it was missing something."
17,1913,"Aug 21 2009 	What a disappointment	Yes, it's got a hip reputation, but it's glory days are clearly over: 1.Reported light broken upon check in. Five nights later, it still wasn't fixed. 2.Bfast service in restaurant was GLACIAL. Plus they have the nerve to automatically add 20% tip for a single diner. In the restaurant, not room service! 3.Newspaper finally showed up 3 mornings in to my stay. 4.Only one window (of 2) in room would open. 5.picture on TV was awful 6.no a/c in the hallways 7. a/c unit in room sounded ancient--very noisy. 8.single stairmaster in the gym is clunky/has seen better days. I stayed here because it's so close to my office but for these rates there are much better options in the area, including a simple Hamptons Inn and Hilton Garden Inn, both of which are brand new."
18,1913,Aug 17 2009 	Love Soho and The Soho Grand	This place is great. Perfect location if you are driving from the south as it is 2 minutes from the Holland tunnell. The whole place has a very casual vibe and the staff is very nice. The bar is also very nice and surprisingly quiet. Every time we stay there we feel like we are the only guests there even when it's full. This is the only place to stay in my opinion. Not super fancy but right on.
19,1913,"Aug 12 2009 	Can't Beat the Location	We arrived on a redeye at 7 a.m. and were immediately allowed to check in to our room (no waiting 'till 3 pm) - that's service. Doormen were always very friendly. One of the bellguy's gave us some good recommendations about nearby bars to check out. Room, of course, was tiny, but that is a given. The first night the sheets smelled of smoke, but that seemed to go away (maybe we just got used to it). There was a slight musty smell to the room and bathroom, but it didn't bother us too much. Bathroom counter space is non-existent and it is definitely a chore for two people to try to get ready at the same time. Also, ladies, beware: the lighting is horrible for doing makeup. They might consider installing some high quality lighted mirrors. We did not eat at the hotel or visit the bar -- too many other places to see! Can't beat the location - which is really what you are paying for. Wifi is spotty. Check out was a breeze - there was a small phone charge on our bill (which was not ours) and the lady took care of it without the slightest hesitation. Bags were stored for us while we walked around the city for a few more hours. No hassles. Overall, a great trip."
20,1913,"Jul 28 2009 	friendly hotel	Rooms are fairly small, but the overall ambience is great - nice bar, good business centre, and the staff are all very helpful. Lots of good restaurants around.Wireless internet is a bit slow."
21,1913,"Jun 15 2009 	Don't Stay Here...	It was over priced for such a small room. The food was ok, but over priced. We had trouble checking in because they couldn't find us in the system. We saved room with credit card, but paid cash, and they still haven't given us our money back on credit card. The air didn't work in the room. The whole place has a funk smell to it. The staff were nice though."
22,1913,"Jun 1 2009 	Great location - trendy hotel!	My husband and I spent one night at the Soho Grand celebrating our first wedding anniversary. We booked a Romantic Weekend package that included a bottle of champagne, chocolate, strawberries, breakfast in bed and a nice corner suite. The service was great and we got a complimentary drink in the bar as they missed giving us our glass of champagne upon arrival. The only bad thing was the extra charge fof 11 dollars for the wi-fi internet."
23,1913,"May 28 2009 	Great Location - No Bargain	We stayed at the Grand for a combined 3 night business/leisure trip. The location is perfect for exploring SoHo and the surrounding area. The area is perfect for shopping - there are a ton of boutique shops and trendy stores all around. I've stayed in a lot of NYC hotels rooms and the room at the SoHO Grand was definitely a lot smaller than most. The shower was a bit grungy and not up to par with other hotels in this price range ~ water pressure was almost non existent. The room was clean and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. Our television did not work properly for the first 1.5 days due to private codes on the clicker - the hotel couldn't even figure everything out. The gym was adequate with 3 treadmills, 1 bike, 1 elliptical and some free weights. Overall, this is an &quot;ok&quot; hotel - my guess it that there are better deals out there."
24,1913,"May 19 2009 	Great if you want to pay a lot for a closet	The only good thing about this hotel is location. Otherwise, the rooms are small, it's loud, it's filled with stupid hipsters and it's way, way over priced. We asked for a quite room so they decided to put near the pantry where the free coffee is (that's right -- a &quot;four star&quot; hotel without coffee in the room) so every morning you'd hear dozens of slamming doors. The hotel was sold out during the weekend so there was no moving.The bed was tiny, the room was crappy -- it wasn't even well decorated. The bottom line find another hotel if you want a good time in NYC."
25,1913,"May 16 2009 	This is a huge hotel	I love the hotel- we had a beautiful suite-incredible design and quite comfortable. The staff was friendly and professional. . Location was great- soho, little italy, china town. I would recommend the hotel."
26,1913,Apr 28 2009 	Another Solid Stay	This was our 4th stay at the Soho Grand over the past 2 years. The location cannot be beat and the rooms have always been more than adequate. The service has always been excellent. We would not hesitate to come back.
27,1913,"Apr 23 2009 	Loved the Soho Grand	We just returned from a week in New York, where we stayed at the Soho Grand hotel. We loved the location! It's a very edgy, hip hotel, with a great lobby bar area. The lobby was busy all the time, people coming and going, meeting friends, etc. The food is good, and light meals are available at least until midnight. The room was very comfortable, although small, and amenities were excellent. The staff is unsurpassed! Excellent service, alot of attention, helpful, as pleasant as can be. The location is perfect. Two subway stations - one around the corner, one a few blocks away. And there are always taxi's available in front. Concierge couldn't have been more helpful, and very well informed. Breakfast at the hotel is terrific, and we also went to Pain Quotidien, about 3 blocks away. We have been to their location in ABC Carpet and Home, and have always loved it. The Soho outpost is just as good. Many great restaurants nearby. Walk to Greenwich Village, lower east side, Tribeca (film festival one block away). Wonderful 5 days!"
28,1913,"Apr 19 2009 	Past its glory days	When at the Soho Grand, it's not hard to imagine what an exciting and hip place it must have been when it first opened. The common spaces (lounge and bar) are still beautiful. However, the rooms and interiors are due for updating.Pros:* Decent Soho location* Good bar area* 24 hour gym* Overall a sophisticated ambianceCons:* Small rooms, not atypical of NYC but less tolerable since rooms also dated. Bathrooms in particular could be upgraded.* Slow wireless access (at times not working). Perhaps their typical leisure guest does not care much about this.Overall, I would suggest checking prices of other options before committing to this hotel."
29,1913,"Apr 11 2009 	Excellent Stay	Very lean rooms, big-for-NY, amazing location. The bed was very comfortable. Free wireless Internet."
30,1913,"Mar 30 2009 	Long in the day faded Glory	I remember when the Soho Grand first opened in the 1990s. It was a super trendy spot where media and entertainment types stayed when visiting NYC. It was the first cool hotel to open downtown. The bar buzzed at night, power breakfasts happened in the lobby, and actors on junkets demanded to stay there.But since then, a variety of hotel options have opened below 14th Street -- The Bowery, The Tribeca Grand, The Mercer, and more. And the Soho Grand has not been updated since it opened. I stayed there recently while in town on business, and moved out after one night.The location is good -- at the intersection of Soho, Chinatown, and Tribeca. But not as good as the above mentioned hotels which are in the middle of neighborhoods, not on the fringes.The rooms are tiny. And when it first opened, you could forgive this as it was truly the only option downtown. But now there are more options with spacious rooms.All the above would be OK if the owners had kept up the hotel. And the lobby is still in good condition (although the decor is dated.) But the rooms are dumps. Mine smelled like cigarette smoke. I was assured by the management that the room had always been non-smoking, but it was clear that a lot of people had smoked in it -- and the carpet/vents hadn't been replaced in ages. With the AC off, the smell of stale smoke held in the air. The AC unit itself was very noisy and uneven. The windows were filthy. The TV (flatscreen) got fuzzy reception as if the cable was illegal. The sheets were scratchy. (Come on, people, even the W hotels have high thread count sheets these days.) The mattress was old, worn, and sunk in towards the middle. I had a restless night's sleep in a sunken bed with scratchy sheets and a loud AC. Woke with a neckache and stuffy nose from the smoke smell. My co-worker who was staying in another room said to me &quot;What in the world happened to this place?&quot; He had the same experience.I moved in with a friend for the next night.It felt like the management knows it can't compete with all the nicer hotels that have opened so aren't putting money into the place. Judging from all the Euros on a holiday in the lobby, this is a package hotel. No more cool actors or models here. Our rate was good for NY --$225 a night -- but the room was the same as if we had stayed at Chinatown Holiday Inn.The owners can't improve on the room size but they could: Rip out the old carpets and put wood flooring in the rooms, wash the windows (interior and exterior), brighten up the rooms, upgrade the AC units, get new mattresses and sheets and fumigate.Service was good. Bathrooms were nice and calm (they should used the bathroom as an example of how to make a small space feel comfortable)."
31,1913,"Mar 17 2009 	Poor housekeeping...and watch the mini bar	This hotel is OK if you can get a good discount but not if you pay the rack rate. The location is excellent if you like the seedy fringe of Soho next to China Town (which I do), but not if you need to be in mid town for an early meeting or are nervous about the dingier parts of Manhattan. The rooms are small and comfortable but the housekeeping is consistently poor. The lobby and hallways are grimy and in need of refurbishment. On a recent stay the cleaner removed the soap and the toilet paper and two light bulbs, and did not replace them. On another occasion, the television remote control was missing and a replacement never arrived. After my last stay there mini bar charges were incorrecttly added to my credit card one week after I had left. I never use hotel mini bars but when I contacted the hotel they refused to reverse the charges and I eventually gave up trying to do anything about them."
32,1913,"Mar 14 2009 	Amazing Stay.	I stayed at the Grand Soho Hotel during a very busy night, Valentines day. The location is pretty good, about two blocks away from a major subway terminal (Canal Street). The hotel is situated by a very busy area, however the entrance is on a less populated block. There are 24 hour restaurants in the China Town area and a 24 hour Deli directly across the street from the entrance. The employees are all REALLY nice, they never came off as &quot;snotty&quot;. Upon check-in all guests received free champagne, they filled our cups to the top... NICE. The rooms are very clean, the bathrooms have nice artistic wallpaper and are designed nicely. The tub is larger than standard size. The shower has some great water pressure, a feature adjustable. The beds are very soft and easy to sleep in. The beds are Queens size, my boyfriend is 6'2 and had no problems sleeping in it, his feet were not hanging out, etc. Their television is a bit out dated, however it has cable and you can watch DVDs (if you bring your own - the player is free to use). The mini bar is a bit expensive, I would recommend to go across the street and purchase whatever you need. The rooms are very quiet as well, on a busy day I expected to hear lots of noise.... but I was left undisturbed. The hotel has multiple elevators, I never waited more than a minute to use them. Pets are also allowed in the hotel, which is very obvious from the artwork to the pet food on the menu. There is also a machine on every floor that disburses free coffee, tea, hot chocolate, ice and water. Overall this was an excellent experience."
33,1913,"Mar 3 2009 	Friendly staff and great views if you get the right room	I had two rooms during my split stay, one was luckily north facing and on the 16th floor enabling me to see the Chrysler Building and the Rockefeller Centre. Absolutely stunning at night...The service was great and the rooms and hotel averall are modern, stylish and clean. THe downside is that this all comes at a cost. Breakfast for two as room service will set you back at least $70, but having stayed elsewhere in New York then it's worth the extra if you can afford it. The location is superb too."
34,1913,"Feb 3 2009 	Great location for dining and shopping	Stayed at S.G. last weekend, loved the restaurants on corner - Ate at Lusso, and had a great time. Shopped up and down West Broadway then over to Broadway. Eveerything was close by, and the doormen at S.G. were very helpful.."
35,1913,"Jan 29 2009 	Great looking and a good location but nothing else	We stayed at the Soho Grand for a weekend away and it is very aesthetically pleasing, but that is pretty much all I can say. The staff seemed like they were doing me a favor versus actually providing customer service. The rooms were nicely appointed, but small and the bathrooms were very small. Plus, there was absolutely no counter top, which I can't stand in a hotel. I found the price reasonable as compared to any other hotel in the city. It is in a great neighborhood, but I was just expecting more. The $8 beer we got from the mini-fridge was completely flat and we could not get the room service folks to understand that we felt owed a new beer."
36,1913,Jan 27 2009 	Best Stay in New York in 25 years	Agonised over where to stay for nine nights in NYC. Have been there every couple of years since 1985. Have never been treated as well in a New York Hotel as we were at the Soho Grand. Surprising for an establishment frequented by the odd celebrity but never for a moment felt anything other than genuinely cared for by great people. Smallish King bed room for two people for nine nights but very good use of space made it absolutely fine. And overall tremendous value for money. Seriously impressive place and people.
37,1913,"Jan 12 2009	Perfect weekend getaway!	My husband picked the Soho Grand because of it's great location, which was all that really mattered to me initially, but my stay was one pleasant surprise after another.Our room was part of a &quot;Seduction in Soho&quot; package, so we were offered champagne upon arrival, which was nice. But the real treat was the staff. I kept thinking that someone had informed them it was our anniversary because everywhere I turned, someone was being warm and helpful (and not in the annoying overbearing way I find in some of the places I visit in the city). It turns out, that's just the way they are. Thanks to all of them, every transition was smooth, I got everything I needed, got great directions easily, was introduced to my new favorite dessert (warm berry crisp with ice cream) and enjoyed a worry-free, relaxing weekend. I'm generally more a fan of the raw and gritty NYC and often choose to stay in hotels like the Chelsea Hotel to avoid too much of the trendy and &quot;sceney&quot;, but this was just right. Comfort, culture, colorful people. And I found the lounge a great place to take it all in. We stayed in room 1606 with a great skyline view, featuring the Empire State Building. Rose petals and chocolates were a nice touch and our package also treated us to cocktails in the lounge (they have some great ones!) and a nice breakfast (in-room service if you like). Comfortable beds, good bathroom lighting and a &quot;skinny&quot; full-length mirror were some other room features that kept me in good spirits.Based on this stay, we've decided to make the Soho Grand our new NYC headquarters. We'll be back soon."
38,1913,"Jan 6 2009 	Great Hotel Great Location	Stayed at the SoHo Grand on my 3rd visit to New York and loved it. I had worried from reviews that it may be a bit pretentious but the staff were very friendly and I felt very comfortable there. The location is brilliant, with designer shops all around, great breakfast bars and restaurants, and walking distance down to Chinatown, Little Italy, the Financial District and Staten Island ferry. Loved my stay here, would stay there again and definitely recommend it."
39,1913,"Jan 4 2009 	soho grand	really a very nice hotel, design and decor was great. The rooms are a bit small but very nice in forniture and the linen are FANTASTIC. Only a problem during the stay we wait 45 minutes for someone that pick up our luggages from the room..."
40,1913,"Dec 30 2008 	Love at first sight....	Walked by Soho Grand at my first visit back in 2006 and had a sneek peek in the lobby and told my self that at the next visit to New York I was definately going to stay here. Arrived early one sunday morning in October and got my room immidiately, not the biggest room that i have ever stayed in but the view was definately the best that i have ever had.A swift and very curtious checkin, great consierge desk and the porters and doormen were always very attentive. Loved the design, some reviews say that its starting to get run down I say Its a design that only becomes more beautiful with age, I belive that it adds to the great character of the Hotel, even though its only 10 years old It has that comfortable, stable feel, like sitting at your grandparents, it might not be the latest design but its &quot;homey&quot;.My only concern is actually the lounge it looked nice but the seating was horrible, also I think that if you reccommend a bottle of wine to a party of 8 you make sure that you have more than one bottle of it and also when you then reccomend your next bottle, the house wine, it should not be twice as expensive as the first bottle. Just very strange and not very customer friendly. And as a Swede that loves his breakfast the Grand Continental breakfast was a joke, 4 cokkies a croissant and some jam.... please.... but maybe thats just me. Loved it and will definately stay again, a great hotel. Almost forgot to mention that Housekeeping was great as well, very good cleaning of the room."
41,1913,"Nov 17 2008 	hotel interior looking a little tired	our second time staying at the Grand, Dec. '05 was are first and we loved the comfort of the room. This time i found that the hallways were looking a litle worn. Excellent staff, an very friendly. Expedia rated the hotel a 4 star, i would say 31/2. having to travel to NYC every month on business, i take advantage of all the Hotels in the city to compare one to the other. Overall, The &quot;Grand&quot; is not so grand, but i hope they read this and seriously take a look at the halls."
42,1913,"Nov 13 2008	classic gotham	Hotel prices in Manhattan seem to have been going up quite steadily, so I was happy to find a decent deal at the Soho Grand. if you're intending to spend time around Soho, the location is very good, on par with the likes of 60 Thompson. The atmosphere at the hotel is very dark and moody, in a nice way - the dimly lit interior has a very classic &quot;Gotham City&quot; type of feel to it. My room was small as expected, but quite convenient. nothing very notable, except that I was able to fit my hand half way through the gap under the room door. this means you can hear everything from the hallway clearly, thankfully the room was at the end of it though. One thing I was unpleased with was the wireless internet, which was unbearably slow and at times not working at all. I had to do some work on several evenings but was actually far better off hooking my cellphone to the laptop, as the wifi was completely jammed. Service on the other hand was friendly both at the door, where you could always find several bellhops opening doors and hailing cabs, as well as at the front desk.Overall I'd gladly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a nice accomodation near Soho, but then again there are several other fairly similar options in the same price range, so it really depends on what kind of a price you're able to find."
43,1913,"Nov 3 2008 	Awesome Design but a little worn 	I LOVE NEW YORK! I go a lot.. and I love staying in SoHo. For my fiance's birthday this year we wanted to go bak to NYC for a special weekend, but wanted to be sure to create new memories &amp; not tamper with the old, spectacular ones from the previous year. So... I booked the SoHo Grand thinking it would be a great location.. and has a good reputation with a fair price. Well- we walked in &amp; were immediately wow'ed by the vintage touches &amp; unique design. We were very impressed. We were given Champagne at check in &amp; the front staff was amazing to accomidate us while they finished preparing our roo (we were in by 10am.) When we got to our room, we found a typical NYC tiny hotel room. Not very impressive- but expected. So we trudgd on... soon after, the smell of cigarette smoke started to come into our room, and we all know that isn't allowed in NYC (*the floor was called Non Smoking). When we called the front desk &amp; they told me they couldn't handle my question, but someone would call me back. An hour &amp; A half later, no call back. We were leaving for dinner so I called again. Same thing-- no one could help me.... but they'd get back to me &amp; I made the kid promise me SOMEONE would call back. When we got back from dinner, our room was SUPER hot &amp; the smell of smoke was enough to keep us from falling asleep. Still no call back from a manager. The next morning I got up &amp; called again.. this time they said they would change our rooms for us &quot;No problem&quot;-- after 3 guest calls just to get someone to listen to me? I'd say there's a problem. The manager didn't apologize for the lazy response or offer any discount or any relief for the awful first night we spent @ their hotel. The next room was bigger &amp; the temperature was more comfortable. The mini bar was hot-- so they had to come &amp; change the whole thing out for a different one which took 45 minutes... and still out requested ammenities as prt of their &quot;Grand Guest&quot; program had not showed up (Ipod player, newspaper, pet fish fo the weekend... hey- they offered!) When we checked out on Sunday-- no mention again of the room change disruption or &quot;how was your stay?&quot; Just took my credit card &amp; said goodbye. When I asked to speak to the manager again about the lack of response to our uncomfortable stay-- she offered little more than the assurance that thir communication as a team was being addressed so it wouldn't happen again-- but nothing for us, the poor saps who endured it for the 2 nights we were in the city @ their hotel. When I got home-- it irritated me more &amp; more. The rooms were not cheap by any means... and frankly I have had much better service &amp; stays at other lower cost hotels in Manhattan. So-- I tried one more time to write a letter to the manager. I penned an email almost identical to this descripion just saying I am in the service industry &amp; if i heard any of my clients had received treatment like this-- I'd want to know about it and make it right with the customer. The manager called me &amp; left a message for me to return his call. I did so-- to get his voice mail. In the message, I stated clearly when I would be availble for him to reach me-- and of course-- NO CALL BACK&gt;I'm sorry but the SoHo Grand dropped the ball bigtime with me. I would not reccommend it to friends-- there are much more capable hotels for the money youwill spend at the SoHo Grand."
44,1913,"Nov 2 2008 	Confused checkin Great Hotel	We arrived, checked in and made our way to our room (dragging our own bags as bellboys seemed thin on the ground). Arriving at the room we discovered a group of guests still inside.A phone call downstairs led to some confusion. Irritatingly they asked me to come downstairs rather than immediately coming to find us and remedy the situation.We were assigned and sent to find a new (upgraded) room, however this non-smoking room stank of stale smoke. We complained and were shown two more rooms. The final room neither smelt of smoke nor contained other guests and so we took it.Following this very protracted checkin we had a wonderful stay and enjoyed everything else about the hotel. Zoe the check-in manager was very helpful and genuinely sorry for the mixup."
45,1913,"Nov 1 2008 	showering in bottled water..	That's right. I washed up with bottled water when I stayed at the Soho Grand...Granted, I may have some ridiculous standards when it comes to my hotel rooms (including functioning plumbing and a prompt and responsive staff). However, the Soho Grand certainly failed in providing these. During my stay on October 30, 2008, I woke up to get ready for an important client meeting when I discovered that the water coming out of the sink faucet was a murky brown color. Next, I tried the shower, only to find that the water there was also brownish in color.I promptly called the front desk, and they said that that someone would be up immediately to address the problem. After nearly 10 minutes and no response, I called back, and the staff again reassured me that someone would be up to address the situation. Again, after several minutes, I called the front desk asking to be transferred to another room so that I could shower. Now, the staff told me that this was neighborhood problem and nothing could be done to correct the problem. The staff then connected me to room service, who after explaining the situation, sent up four glass bottles of ice cold Saratoga water.I truly am grateful for the opportunity to shower with bottled water; however, the hotel staff clearly lacks an understand of how best to address such problems. First, if it is a neighborhood problem (and thus out of the hotel's control), please tell me that it is rather than telling me to waste my time waiting for maintenance. Second, if you are going to provide me with water to wash up, it may be better to send something that didn't come directly from the Arctics to my room.Overall, a very disappointing (and retrospectively hilarious) experience."
46,1913,"Oct 18 2008 	Awesome quintissential New York great location	My husband and I stayed here for a few days during one of his work trips. It was my first trip to New York as an adult and the hotel was simply wonderful. Great architecture, great decor, loved the main bar, and the styilshness of the place. Our room was just right, and a good size for New York apparently. Lovely high bed, and good facilities in the room. The hotel is in a great location for exploring Manhattan, both north and south. We loved the shopping in Soho, a bit of something for everyone with some interesting art galleries, fashion, food etc."
47,1913,"Oct 13 2008 	Fabulous Hotel!!	We booked this hotel through Lastminute.com for our honeymoon. After reading some reviews I emailed through to request a high level room. We were allocated a superb corner room on the 7th floor.We could not fault this hotel. Staff were unbelievably friendly - especially the doormen where nothing was beyond them. Always a friendly hello and goodbye. They were able to get taxi's at the drop of a hat and were very 'in the know'.The gentleman who was on duty in the bar/lounge area during our stay was brilliant. He knew all the places to go and gave great advice on local amenities. I'm only sorry I didnt take his name to write and let the hotel know (he was working on Tuesday &amp; Wednesday). The welcome we received was lovely and as it was our honeymoon we received a bottle of bubbly and some gorgeous strawberries to dip in a lovely jar of melted chocolate. It was a very thoughtful touch.The room wasnt huge (none are in New York) but it was immaculate and had all the facilities we needed (and some that were added bonuses!!) The bathroom was very cool and clean and the toiletries very nice indeed!Bathrobes provided, flat screen tv, dvd player, hairdryer were all included (as you'd expect) but they also provided an umbrella for your use while you were there - very cool (and thankfully not needed as the weather was amazing)A huge bowl of shiny red apples in the lobby ensured we got at least some vitamins while we were there!!All in all, if we are lucky enough to go back to New York, we would DEFINITELY stay here again and have no hesitation in recommending it to others."
48,1913,"Oct 12 2008	Awful amenities terrible price gouging.	Where to begin? They short-changed me twice at checkout. They told me the I had deducted a $IOO deposit on my credit card when in fact they had deducted $150. When I complained they suddenly &quot;found&quot; the extra money. I paid for the amenties in cash, and they short-changed me yet again by $8 on a $36 dollar bill. They have yet to return my credit card deposit. The room-service bill was a total ripoff. They charged me a $5 delivery charge AND a mandatory tip. There was a space on the bill for &quot;additional&quot; tip. When I didn't add this additional tip, the room service man gave me a filthy look. There was a 40 watt bulb in the reading lamp next to the bed, not enough to read by. I called and asked for a stronger bulb, they said they didn't have any anywhere in the hotel. The TV was horrible. Terrible picture, and it was stuck on wide-screen which distorted everything and made all the people look fat.  I was booked for three nights, left after one night and slept on a friend's sofa instead."
49,1913,"Aug 26 2008	Great Location. OK Hotel.	I recently had a 4 night stay in the Soho Grand. This was my third trip to New York and this time I wanted to stay in the Soho area. In my previous visits I stayed off Lexington Ave. The area of Soho was a much better place to stay with many shops, bars, restaurants and clubs within stumbling block from the hotel. I knew that New York hotels were expensive but we pushed the boat out a little further in order to get a luxurious, top class hotel in the Soho area. The Soho Grand can not put in this category. First impressions were good. Check-in was fast and the glass of champagne while checking in was a nice touch. When we arrived at the room we had to question if we were given the correct room type. We had paid for an upgrade. The room was small, which I expected. The bathroom was okay, but the only luxurious thing in there was the Malin + Goetz products. The curtains and Blackout blinds were worn with some tears. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The view was of a building site. We asked to change the room but, as the hotel was full the only thing that they could offer would be to take a downgrade ,with a better view, which was available the following day. We decided to stay as we were. The bar had a really good vibe to it but the prices are very expensive by any standards. We only used the concierge to obtain an area map so can not comment there but the Front door guys were always very welcoming and friendly. Overall, we enjoyed our weekend in New York and loved staying in the Soho area. I probably would not stay in the Soho Grand again. I think, for the money, there is much better quality out there."
50,1913,"Aug 25 2008	WORST service - do NOT go	Soho grand has historically received horrible reviews, but during my multiple stays at this hotel, my experiences had never been that bad. HOWEVER, during my last stay here, I found the service to not only be terrible, but actually OFFENSIVE. Our reservation was messed up by an error made by their staff, but their solution was to have us pay for their mistake by reserving another room at full price. Then, the guest services person was so unbelievably rude, that I hung up with her and called 66 Thompson and Mercer Hotel to see if I could switch hotels late in the evening (unfortunately, they were both booked). Absolutely, under NO circumstances would I ever, ever recommend going to this hotel. Believe the rumors - they are TERRIBLE here!"
51,1913,"Aug 18 2008 	A stylish base for exploring New York but very poor value	As New York was the last stop on our round-the-world trip, we thought we would splash out on a &quot;boutique&quot; hotel recommended by Ypma's generally good Hip Hotels and decided to go for the SoHo Grand. Our overall experience was pretty good: staff friendly, efficient and helpful, the surroundings were nicely decorated and a haven from the sticky New York streets in June.However, the rooms were to be honest fairly small and with reasonable quality furnishings, but, having stayed in places like Hotel du Vin in the UK, were nothing to write home about.What made me rate this hotel as only &quot;Neutral/Average&quot; was the cost. Boy oh boy oh boy is this place expensive. For the money that they charge for everything, room, food, bar, even the minibar (especially the minibar), you seriously pay through the nose. It really is very poor value and I say this from the point of view of someone who lives and works in London, not known as one of the world's cheapest cities.The location is great with a lot of the attractions within easy walking distance (not to mention the excellent Dos Caminos mexican restaurant) and the hotel is comfortable, pleasant and - yes - pretty hip. Just don't expect to get many bangs for your buck."
52,1913,"Aug 17 2008 	Disappointing but with a few stars...	I was very looking forward going to NY and staying at the Soho Grand. The hotel was disappointing and not was I was hoping for. It's not a luxury hotel, it's not a first class hotel... it's just a trendy hotel. The room was very small and very cold. We tried to close down for AC without success. There are a few stars in the room, like the overfilled minibar with several choices, the bathroom amenities, DVD-player, large flat screen and rustic furnitures. If you a staying for several nights - take the liberty and order a complimentary goldfish, it was funny and a nice touch. However - make sure they can take care of the fish. We had to call to get a efreshing water at the 3rd day.Things I was missing was a nice restaurant, breakfast buffet, the welcoming public areas, serivce -sometimes I felt the staff (concierge, bell boys and front office) very insignificant. Upon departure no one help us with the luggage, they just stand in the entrance hall and glaring. The breakfast alternatives by room service is ok but nothing special, a little bit boring. I would love a personal touch or something that gave you a &quot;wow&quot;. The location is great, next to SoHo shopping, Little Italy, China Town, WTC and everything. Next time I think I will try to stay at Starwood and their W hotel concept."
53,1913,"Aug 4 2008 	Good Hotwire deal!	We booked a 4* downtown via Hotwire for $239. I could tell that we would get the SoHo Grand -- there are lots of websites that help you match the hotel to the neightborhood + amenities that Hotwire gives you. So, after checking out all the reviews on TripAdvisor, we decided to take a chance. Here's the bottom line: it's a good deal for a NYC hotel if you book it at $240 a night, but if you pay rack rate ($500+), you'd expect a lot more. The room is very small, but big enough to hold the bed, and dresser, and wardrobe (no closet, a travesty) -- but just barely. The bathroom was a decent size, but not a palace. We did have a queen bed with some awesome Frette linens, but the drapes and blackout blinds were in really sad shape (holey in places). The TV is an HD TV without cable or a HD converter for the over the air signal -- it's possibly the worst image quality I've ever seen in any TV of any kind. But you don't go to NY to watch tv (unless you're a guy)...It has a really good location. It's right next to the 1, 2 stop on Canal St, and just a 5 minute walk to the other Canal St station (6, N, J , Q), so you can go uptown to either the East side or West side really easily. It's also right between Tribeca and SoHo, so you get to be uber chic, or uber uber chic. Excellent noise insulation. We were on the 4th floor, facing Canal St and Tribeca, and we actually faced a club, but couldn't hear anything, which was amazing. The hotel is shaped like a T, so if you're at the base of the T, you might have some noise from the Holland Tunnel, which spits up a block away. If you are a partier, they have a faux-club in the lobby, complete with bouncers. It makes getting to your room a bit hairy at night as there are these big guys in black between you and the elevator who don't really believe that you're staying there (if you look like a grad student, like me). If you're on the 3rd floor, your room might be REALLY noisy because the club and the 3rd floor share an atrium -- there's no wall between them to hold out the noise. Which gets me to the staff. Cleaning staff = got the job done, beautifully. Front desk = efficient, professional, no unexpected charges. Concierge = I don't think they're from NYC because they didn't know some basic things about museums (I wanted to find the Cooper-Hewett Design Museum, which is part of the Smithsonian). The security thugs = for my own good, but really, do you need to be quite that rude? Overall, a great deal for NYC on short notice."
54,1913,"Aug 4 2008 	Not what I hoped for	Let's start with a few positives before getting into why I recommend you stay elsewhere. We received exceptional service from the front desk, bell boys, front door greeters, etc. The location is fantastic and the lobby is pretty cool. However, that's where the good parts end.The NYC boutique/modern hotel market is very competitive. Soho Grande was one of the first....and it's showing. The decor of the rooms is very passe and dated. There is no closet - it's a section of the room partitioned off with partial/temporary walls (as is the mini bar). The room reeked of smoke but wasn't marked as a smoking room. Overall, you felt like you were staying at a generic chain hotel instead of someplace unique.The Soho Grande is quite expensive. You can do much better for your NYC dollars than this."
55,1913,"Aug 3 2008	Overpriced and overvalued	I think that this hotel is too old to be posh, too dark to be nice and to expensive to be valuable. The area is fantastic of course for shopping, eating and watching people. But I dont understand why people get crazy about this hotel. Its just a hotel."
56,1913,Jul 30 2008 	Loved the SoHo Grand	Very nice property in the heart of Soho. the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. We will definitely return.
57,1913,"Jul 25 2008 	Attidute and small rooms	A friend of mine who lives in New York recommended the Soho Grand for a long weekend stay.In hindsight, he probably enjoyed the night life there and thought the hotel would be as good but never actually experienced the Hotel itself. When I walked in I was impressed by the original architecture and decor. The space has a bit of a &quot;Blade Runner&quot; feel to it; decadent-hip-retro-modern if that makes any sense.The check-in process was efficient, the service was nonchalant.The shock came when I entered the room - it was tiny, the decor was out dated and the use of space was completely inefficient. There was not even a spot in the room where you could sit comfortably.The in-room safe was not functional.The bathroom was big enough, but the soap had a strong mint perfume which became overbearing after a while. The water pressure in the shower was good.The next morning there was no newspaper by the door. We went down for breakfast and asked for the morning paper at the front desk and for some reason they made us feel like we were bothering them.We had breakfast in the gorgeous living area by the lobby (the one you see on the web site). The food was good but the service was non-existent.After breakfast, we stopped by the front desk again and mentioned that the safe wasnt working. They said they would send an 'engineer' right away to fix it, but that i had to be in the room for &quot;insurance reasons&quot;. After waiting in the room for 45 minutes and 2 calls later, no one had showed up so I gave up and decided to go out and start my day.We only stayed 2 of the planned 4 nights and moved to the Four Seasons hotel.We did enjoy the convenience of the Soho Grand's great location and we did enjoy the night life. However my general impression is that the staff at the Soho Grand doesnt receive adequate training and doesn't know how deal with clients and solve simple problems without attitude."
58,1913,"Jul 17 2008 	Fun weekend	Great hotel - my husband and I were unexpectedly in NYC for 4th of July weekend which is an &quot;off&quot; weekend for the city, but we had a great time. My flight was early and even though I arrived 3 hours before standard check-in time, the front desk let me in early - very accommodating. The room was really comfortable. Our floor's coffee/hot chocolate dispenser was just next door to our room which was very convenient. The bar was efficient - loved the couches in the lounge. I had some work to finish up the first afternoon, so went to the yard - it was great. The server was extremely helpful, not only with food, but he also brought me power for my laptop after a few hours. I basically had the place all to my self for the afternoon - although it filled up quickly after 4:00, when they open it up to the public.I agree with an earlier review - the guy out front each night was the best - he was totally helpful with all sorts of information and extremely friendly.This is in a great location - lots of fun shopping all around and v. convenient to subway."
59,1913,"Jul 14 2008 	Soho Not So Grand Deja Vu	After reading the review from &quot;Soho Not So Grand&quot; I thought the guy that wrote it must have stayed with us. We had much the same expereince. The hotel overall is not guest friendly, is statring to look dated, the rooms are very small and the attitude - even for a so-called &quot;hip property&quot; is unaccepable, through the roof. In my opinion, hip is great if it can be backed up with across-the-board service and quality accomodations. The Soho Grand may have been all that a few years ago, but now it's just all flat. Just a few of our disapointments with the hotel on our recent stay.When we booked our room, I specifically told the reservationist that we were bringing our daughter down to the hotel to see the July 4th fireworks. Naturally my first concern was that we'd have a high floor room with a view toward the fireworks. No problem, assured the reservationist. There was a problem. Upon checking into the hotel they only had a higher floor room on the opposite corner of the hotel facing away from the fireworks. Note: After scoping out the surrounding buildings I determined it was highly unlikely any room would have given a view of the Macy's fireworks. By the way, when we checked in and explained this to the front desk clerk he told us we'd be able to see them since they were shot off from around Macys! I didn't have the time or energy at this point to explain that the fireworks are shot off from the East River. This was the second desk clerk to help us, and at least he made an effort. The first one didn't know anything about anything, but she made sure to give free champagne to three people who walked up to the desk while we wre attemptiong to check-in. I eventually asked a third desk clerk if we too, paying customers, might actually be granted the bounty of their kindness with a glass. She instructed clueless clerk # 1 to pour us some. So anyway, that first clerk upon being told of the fireworks-view room didn't even seem to realize it was the Fourth of July. Then she said, rather disinterestedly, that she had no idea if the room had any view. I inquired further if I might have a look at the room, and she said they couldn't allow that since housekeeping was still cleaning. Okay. Then she tells me I should tallk to the concierge. Now, I go from attitude to super attitude. She hands me the phone and the concierge is on the other end. I explain that the front desk connected me to her (though I'm not sure why) and that we were told our room would have view of the fireworks. The concierge is obviosuly mad that the front desk would lay this on her, and I have to somewhat agree (the front desk should know their own rooms), but it didn't call for Super Attitude. Her cocky reponse was &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; No I wasn't. I should have cut my losses right there and gone to another hotel, but I had my wife and baby and we were all getting tired. An hour later we checked in to our closet and had a nice view on the wrong side of the hotel. The service throughout the stay was cold, or at the least aloof. And it's not aNew York thing, I lived there for years and have stayed in numerous hotels across the city. This place is just run bad and the physical look of the hotels just shows that they don't care anymore. as oftentimes happens when a new hotel opens (the Tribeca Grand) the better staff make abeline to the newer property. I don't know if that's what's happened here, but I threw away $500 for arotten stay. We ended up trudging downtown in the rain and saw about fifteen minutes of the fireworks.One major exception: Did these guys even work for the same hotel? The guys (part of the bell staff) out front and the man who delivered our bags to the room were top-notch, friendly and professional. Now if we could just take them to a better hotel!"
60,1913,"Jul 10 2008 	Not Impressed	I felt the Soho Grand was pretty overpriced, and not nearly as good a value as other hotels in the area.The room was very small, which is typical in a New York Hotel, but I don't feel the small space was well utilized. I stayed in the Hilton Millennium on the same trip and felt that while the rooms' physical dimensions were smaller, the Hilton actually felt larger because the space was put to better use.The TV was roughly a 32&quot; flat panel LCD, unfortunately there was no HD programming, and many big name cable channels were missing from the lineup.The bar was very overpriced with terrible service (average wait time for a drink was in excess of 10 minutes).The outlets in the room were inconveniently hidden behind dressers, beds and mini-bars.All in all, I probably would not stay here again."
61,1913,"Jun 24 2008	Great location service can be a bit up and down...	We stayed at the Soho Grand for 4 nights over New Year's Eve on the way back from Bermuda to the UK. The location was exactly what we were looking for - whenever I have stayed in NY before it has been for work and I have stayed more in the financial district so this time for holidaying it was perfect. So close to all the shops, bars, etc etc. The hotel is fairly large and well known, rooms are average sized for NY - but well decorated with nice bathrooms etc. You get great products here which you can buy in Barneys I later found out. As we stayed over NYE we decided to book in for their party, dinner first - can't remember exactly how much it was think we had a shellfish platter for two which was about 175 USD. The service on the evening in question was an absolute shambles, pretty much non existent, no one was getting any drinks/food, they couldn't find us a table (despite having booked in October..) it was a total mess and the staff were generally unfriendly and couldn't be bothered...they then had the cheek to add on a massive service charge. - I later complained in writing to the manager and he gave me a voucher for two for dinner valid for 6 months OK fair enough but not helpful for a UK resident...So would I stay here again? Probably not as I think others in the area could be a good rival but it's a nice hotel with a nice lounge area so worth popping by for a drink before dinner."
62,1913,"Jun 7 2008 	Fantastic Hotel Fantastic Service	My girlfriend and I stayed for 3 nights at the Soho Grand in May and had a truely wonderful stay. The service was impeccable and the decor in the the lobby, lifts and room was inspiring. Where the hotel excelled was that prior to the trip I had requested a bouquet of my girlfriends favourite flowers, a Bose sound dock and a goldfish to be in our room, all of which the Hotel arranged perfectly. I don't imagine the Holiday Inn offer this level of service. I had booked and Executive King room and the Seduction in Soho package on the hotel website (which happened to save $200+ on the normal basic room rate as the last light was discounted by 50%ish). We were greeted upon arrival with a glass of champagne and the check in process was simple and quick. The room wasn't huge but overall the quality of the bed, bedding, bathrobes and bathroom was excellent. *Bathroom wallpaper is very entertaining.We had breakfast in bed and also in the Lobby bar and both times the service and food was fantastic. I'd also recommend trying the mojito from the hotel bar, although the bar area can get very crowded. If i had to find a flaw with the stay the only problem I had was that the wireless network kept dropping it's connection but that's all (internet is a additional charge) Would recommend the hotel to anyone and look forward to staying there again in the future."
63,1913,"Jun 2 2008 	Terriffic place to stay!!!	My husband and I just returned from our wonderful trip to New York. The Soho Grand was much better than I had expected after reading a few reviews here. The Front Desk staff was helpful, efficifent and engaging. The hotel is a perfect blend of sophistication and elegance, placed right in the heart of Soho. The room was a bit on the small side, but it was always clean and very comfortable. The location is was exactly what we were looking for. We did not want to stay in the touristy Times Square and found that Downtown was a much better fit for the things we wanted to do. If you like galleries, shopping and fine dining this is the place to be. Also, since it is so close to Little Italy and Chinatown, the possibilites for something to do are endless. We would stay there again."
64,1913,"May 30 2008 	Fancy but overprized	We spent 3 nights at the Soho Grand in May. The location is superbe if you like the to hang out in Soho. Very good restaurants and boutiques are close by. It's for sure a special spot with tasteful details and furniture but if you're really into design, you'll be disappointed. They try too hard.Staff was friendly, although it took them 15 minutes to serve my cappucino. The room was very small and quiet disappointing. So is the bathroom. There is no space for storaging all products and amenities were very poor.So overall it's a nice hotel but totally overprized. If you pay over $ 500 for a room, you expect it to be perfect. Would not go back!"
65,1913,"May 25 2008	Noisy not a wnderful experience	Plenty of attitude and style here, but I knew things were a bit off when I saw the lotion bottle provided with the amenities had been used by another guest and was all gunky. Ewww.Terrible noise problem on the side facing the Holland Tunnel (honking taxis and sirens all night). Concierge and front desk staff were great, and they switched us to a quieter room. Complimentary glass of champagne was a nice touch. Rooms are very stylish, small but comfortable.But what was pretty sad was the room service--we requested breakfast by door tag, called to prompt its early arrival the next morning, were told it was on its way, it never came, after three phone calls (when we discovered the order had never even been placed) we gave up. So on our last morning when we needed to get going, we had a snafu that left a bad taste, and were then pressed to find a place for breakfast--if you tell me twice that someting is happening but it's not, don't expect me to believe you the third time. In all, a lot of style but not what we were expecting."
66,1913,May 20 2008 	Great Hotel	This is one of my favorite hotels in NYC. The location is great since it is near great places for shopping (for her) and great places to party and drink (him). The bar scene in this hotel is one of the best in NYC. I highly recommend this hotel for those seeking a fun spot to hang out and more. The only drawback is the rooms are way too small for my liking. But everything else is pretty cool.
67,1913,"May 18 2008 	Soho not so grand!	Certainly when this hotel opened, it had all the hype and was one of 'the' places to be seen in NYC. However, you cannot survive on hype and my experience of the Soho Grand was very much below par throughout. To sum it up, the product is tired and the service weak and not guest focused. My room was not all bad - there was a large plasma screen TV, Bose music system and great minibar selection. They also have good bathroom ammenities. But the furniture was cheap (especially the wardrobe) and the curtains old and stained. The hotel is also turning on the con of 'saving the environment', by having a card that if you do not place on your bed, means they will not change your sheets (you would have thought that it would be the other way round...) - everyone knows that this does not save the environment - just the hotel some money!The experience in the bar/restaurant was also poor. I went down for a cup of tea and was ignored. The barman came over twice to say that he was not the person to serve me and my waiter would be with me shortly. I think I waited 30 minutes to get my order taken and another 20 for the tea to arrive. We ate one evening and the service was not slick (no wine poured, or finesse). Breakfast was OK, but pretty average. There seemed to be no management presence in any area of the hotel and the standards reflected this.The gym was fine - but tiny, Considering the hotel aims to attract a crowd that are probably regular gym goers - they should address this. A colleague dropped a package off for me before I arrived - it did not arrive in my room until the last day (I was there for 4 nights!)The location is good - especially as the shopping and nightlife in Soho are some of the best in the city.The hotel has the potential to be very nice, but the owners need to refurbish and also invest in some better management and training of the staff."
68,1913,"May 17 2008 	Fantastix	Great room, great hotel, great location. Bar and service was fantastic, didnt want to leave after quaffing champagne and beer and the legendary mac n cheese. But sited perfectly for some top restaurants, shops, and of course u could stay in New York for a lifetime and not do 10% of what's out there.The room was cool, slightyl 'industrial chic', which is great and of course its one of - if not the - original boutique hotels. Music - Gotan Project CDs - in the room was perfect for chilling. Service was exemplary, espec in the bar.Probably my favourite hotel in the world!"
69,1913,"May 12 2008 	Location Location	We visited NYC for 9 days back in 2006 and chose to stay at the Soho Grand due to the location and the boutique style of the hotel. Then entrance foyer was very impressive and the industrial theme of the architecture appealed.The concierge service was very good and willing to help with bookings and information. We checked into a room on a lower level and were offered an upgrade to a higher level providing us better views of the surrounding area (Parking lot). The rooms were clean and comfortable. They weren't huge on space but I did not expect a grand living area for a hotel in downtown New York. The hotel was two blocks from many bars, shops and restaurants in the Tribeca / Soho area where we went most evenings avoiding the bling of Times Square. there was a subway station behind the hotel for access uptown and to Brooklyn. The biggest let down with the hotel was the pompous staff working in the bar area of the hotel. As we returned from a shopping spree, we sat at a table and although requested drinks, watched as the waitress rushed to the suits. After one drink, we decided to go. Upon billing the drinks to our room, the attitude changed and the girl was only to happy to help. Needless to say there was no tip for this pathetic act.We tended to eat &amp; drink out, enjoying the friendly service of other establishments who were more than happy to assist."
70,1913,"May 12 2008	TINY room cute wallpaper	Oh NY hotels. The big chains are just so average and the boutique hotels are sometimes just...so average. The hotel is in a great location if you want to be in Soho and near tribeca. the rooms here are really tiny, i thought i was going to have to sleep with my suitcase. in general, the room seemed pretty clean - although i ended up with a bug bite after one night, and my friend who stayed with my on the second night came away with a bug bite.... The bathroom amenities were so-so - bigelow products. if you are looking for a chichi little spot with a lounge that oozes hipness and staff that are mediocre, this place fits the bill."
71,1913,"May 10 2008	Beatiful Place	The interior designer did a truly good job,it's one those places when you get in you have a true sensation of leaving the world behind.Everything the stairs,the room,the bar is unique,elegant and just something else.You can not leave the hotel and just have good time at the bar all day long.New Yorkers tend to go there a lot to.But its understandably on the pricey side.?f you want a different experience you could definitly try it."
72,1913,"Apr 22 2008 	Not so great BAD MANAGEMENT!!!!!	This could be a lovely hotel. It's a great location and quite classy although I was surprised by the corporate decor of the rooms; was expecting it to be a little more boutique in style. However the main thing was the management, This hotel is REALLY badly run and when thing go wrong the management really do not seem to care. I had lost luggage in my previous trip so had two packages delivered ahead of time. One of them was 'lost' by the reception staff and the other they claimed had not arrived. It later transpired that one had been lost also (and had been thre a whole three days ebfore informing me). However they failed to apologise either for their incompetence or for my inconvenience. Further, they failed to deliver my iPod dock to the room and when they did it didn't work. Then the plumbing in the bathroom didn't work (the toliet got blocked, according to the maintenance man it happens all the time), again no apology. All in all it could have been a great place to stay but they really let themselves down. Disappointing..."
73,1913,"Apr 19 2008 	SO .. SO Grand hotel	Well, I had only one night stay in newyork and some free time, a friend of mine recommended th SOHO grand for their Concierge service, I have to admit, the concierge were on top of things for me, pickup, other services and dinner reservations even before my arrival. but when it came to reception, little slow, the rooms again are small and in my case the AC was not working so that was a serious problem, although I agreed with the reception for late checkout the necxt day, the reception called me asking me when you will cehck out. Upon my checkout, I wanted to pass my feedback to the staff, they didn't event bother to ask, how was your stay. I would not say I hated the place, but it would not be my first choice ine newyork."
74,1913,"Apr 13 2008 	Pretentious Staff 	Great location, trendy hotel and room was nice, however we found the staff in the lounge pompous and the concierge ladies were useless. We asked for an Italian restaurant upon our arrival - we were recommended to the closest restaurant. The following morning we waited for the concierges help, while she called a friend and ask her to call her back because she thought our phone was broken...this could have been done once we left as there was no lineup. Best part was, the help was not very helpful. Overall the hotel is nice, but help was hard to be found. Location is wonderful - shopping right out the door, Little Italy a ten minute walk away and the subway was one minute from the hotel."
75,1913,"Apr 1 2008	Sloppy	Check in took forever: first the key cards didn't work. Once we got into the room, it was not as described. (We'd paid for a room with views in two directions). We asked for a different room, and were given new key cards, only one of which worked. We got into the room, stepping over a tray of dirty dishes in the doorway, and found dirty linens left behind. Yuck.Management was barely apologetic.This used to be a very sexy hotel. Now it's just sloppy."
76,1913,"Mar 31 2008 	seen better days	I've stayed at the hotel 3 times over the past 2 years, and it's gotten pretty shabby--both in service and amenities. During this visit--the tub drain wouldn't close, then wouldn't drain, the hair dryer didn't work, the PHONE wouldn't work, and the internet--for which they charge--was spotty--either slow or not functioning. The rooms clearly need some maintenance. The worst part of all of that, is that the staff clearly don't care. I agree with an earlier view that staff are mostly concerned with saving a buck. I don't think this is an isolated case either, as while I was dealing with the issues at the desk, the customer next to me came to the desk and said, you know, there was a problem with everything! Multiple visits from service men didn't fix the room's problems! I was really surprised by the number of issues there were with the room --and wouldn't have really complained had there not been so many of them!--But apparently I am not the only one to have noticed that the hotel has seen better days! I think i'll have to move on to find another NYC hotel I can come back to. Sigh..."
77,1913,"Mar 5 2008	Disappointing	Our stay was blighted by the following:1. Having booked two interconnecting rooms well in advance on arrival our rooms were at different ends of the hotel. This took 30 minutes to correct and we were given rooms for myself and two teenage daughters on a smoking floor! 30 minuntes isn't that long but at the end of a transatlantic flight when all you want to do is sleep........2. The breakfast restaurant is beyond minimalist to be depressing so we chose to eat in the lobby with other guests. Despite there being ample room we were told that we couldn't eat there as they didn't have enough staff. To give you an idea the most people you could have gotten into the free sofa's was 8 and they were 6 paces from the occupied area! 3. Everything is too much trouble for the staff with the exception of the concierge4. This is a hotel run for the benefit of the staff and always with an eye on saving costs.5. Breakfast was always cold. Coffee always stewed. Service with a sneer6. Rooms so small you couldn't swing a Gerbil in them. They are also tired. Minor irritants such as, bath plug leaking, shower constantly dripping, blinds not working, miniscule wardrobe, room service which ignores do not disturb signs. Individually not a big deal but collectively not what you expect.I have stayed in plenty of hotels in NY over the years and other than the advantage of its location for Soho I don't get the hype.All told a huge disappointment. If the management read this no doubt they won't care. I would imagine they're the biggest problem"
78,1913,"Mar 4 2008 	Overall great stay	I had a 4 night stay at the Soho Grand with my best friend to celebrate my birthday. I had paid extra to be in a superior room which cost considerably more for what was quite a small room. It made me wonder just how small the normal rooms must be. It was clean and not at all shabby though and the stereo, CDs and products in bathroom were all nice touches.  We were greeted by the friendliest doormen I have ever encountered, who continued to be really helpful throughout our stay, recommending bars, restaurants and really going above and beyond the call of duty. The front desk gave us a glass of Champagne on arrival, although they, along with the concierge were a bit aloof and the concierge on two occasions said she would arrange guest list and reservations for us and then booked it under the wrong name. This was eventually sorted but caused delay in getting into the club and restaurant. Overall though it was a great stay. The bar was beautiful, the location was perfect with lots of great shops and restaurants a stones throw away. Plus a few celebrity guests! It is also a pet friendly hotel so you'll spot lots of dogs which we liked but I'd bear in mind if you are allergic. I'd certainly stay again."
79,1913,Feb 25 2008 	Fantastic	I took my girlfriend there for her birthday in January of this year.We had 5 nights at the Soho and it was the perfect hotel for us.We were greeted with a glass of champagne on arrival and it set the tone for our stay.The staff were brilliant and very helpfull. From getting us taxis to recommending bars and restaurants.They even gave us free drinks on her birthday.It's in a great location and for New York the rooms aren't too small.I would definately recommend the hotel to anyone and i hope to stay there again soon.
80,1913,"Feb 22 2008	Great location but probably better hotels in NY	Stayed at the Soho Grand for a couple of days with my husband, as part of a business trip to NY. We'd had drinks at the hotel before, on previous trips, and this time decided to stay here. As others have pointed out, the location is great - bang in the heart of Soho and really easy to walk everywhere, lots of good restaurants nearby, fantastic shopping, everything you want really. The hotel itself wasn't bad - our room was OK, although we were upgraded to a higher floor, twelth I think, on check-in, which I think meant we got a better view than we would have done originally. And the view was pretty impressive - a downtown shot of the Empire state and the skyline. But the room itself was on the small side I thought, although normal for NY I guess - and a bit of a tight squeeze for two in the tiny bathroom, no separate shower, just an overhead. But it was all clean, the bed was comfortable and decor fairly well done out. Didn't feel shabby, as some have mentioned. And I liked the CDs in the room and the free coffee bar on each floor. I think the only slight issue I had was with the bar and lounge area - this is obviously the hotel's key selling point and it does get very busy, but even if you're a guest, you're not guaranteed a seat. We had to be quite firm with the girl holding the clipboard, who decides whether you 'get in' or not, and after being relegated to a tiny table in the corner of the bar one night, we did put our foot down and insist on a table in the more comfy lounge area but it was a bit of a stand off. Slightly annoying, but still. It also gets very busy with parties, so if you want to have drinks, or you're meeting people, I'd definitely suggest booking a table. Altogether, not bad, but I think there are so many good hotels in NY, I'm not sure that this one really lives up to the hype."
81,1913,"Feb 20 2008 	Very disappointing experience	I stayed at the Soho Grand Hotel in order to be close to NYU. I was very disappointed. The room was small for the price. I was on the tenth floor, and it was extremely noisy. There was a lot of street noise throughout the night, perhaps because the hotel is near the Holland Tunnel entrance. Also, there was a ton of noise in the hallway, as well as smoking (despite it being a nonsmoking floor). Doors were slamming into the wee hours. At 2 am I finally went into the hallway to ask the rude person talking on his cell phone to be quiet, only to find him in his underwear! Unless you are a real night owl, like to sleep with earplugs, or can sleep through an earthquake, this hotel is not for you."
82,1913,"Feb 13 2008 	Disappointing...	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend break. We booked a superior corner room which was expensive but as we were going for such a short time we decided to splash out. The hotel itself is in a fantastic location and is really nice inside however we experienced a serious problem with our room.We are both hyper sensitive to dust and the first morning we woke we started sneezing. We went out for the day and night thinking that it was the flight over or something else that was causing it. The following morning we woke up once again sneezing. At this point I noticed in the morning that a film of dust was covering all of the surfaces in the bedroom. I called reception and they sent someone from housekeeping up to view the room. I showed them the problem and they agreed that it was dusty and couldn't explain it (I thought it may have been a recent refurbishment but nobody indicated that it was). By late that evening they offered to change our room but at that point in the trip it was pretty pointless as we were leaving the next evening. We had expected some reflection of the issue in our hotel bill which was not forthcoming. So we were pretty disappointed to be honest, for a top class hotel to ignore the issue on checkout was amazing. Needless to say we won't be staying there again and would advise any hayfever or dust allergic travellers to beware!"
83,1913,"Feb 4 2008	cool but starting to lag	my wife and it make a yearly trek now from la to nyc 'round christmas. last couple times we've stayed at the soho grand. like everyone else... LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. it rocks being in soho. But i think that will change for us...we love their bar but the hotel has begun to lose its luster. Rooms seem shabbier then last time we stayed. view gone out front of hotel now that they erected a towering glass building. just not as &quot;fun&quot; anymore. i'd imagine we'd try the W next time or some boutique place. nyc has way too many choices to spend as much as we did for total lack of space... snobby front desk.... weird ceilings in room that look like they've been torn apart and re finished in a quick shoddy way. overall, its cold and impersonal."
84,1913,"Jan 5 2008 	Great location but overpriced	I stayed in the Soho Grand for three nights in December, having travelled with my husband to attend the company Christmas party. Let me say first this is a great location - the journey from the airport is quick, lots of very trendy shopping and nightlife nearby, and well located for subways or taxis uptown.I appreciate that I am older than most of this hotel's clientele, so my head was not turned by the uber trendy bar and restaurant which by all accounts are hugely popular and deservedly so.All I was hoping for was a comfortable room. Our expectations were managed on arrival when we were told that we had the biggest room in the hotel and a wonderful view. (This was actually quite worrying as we thought either we had been allocated the boss's room or he had taken one look and decided not to stay.)What we found was a reasonably spacious room with just about adequate furnishings, though nowhere but the floor to open our bags. The lighting was probably meant to be romantic, but as in many hotels was simply inadequate, and served only to emphasise the decorator's very dark palette. In the morning we discovered the view was of two building sites and an 'interesting' skyline.The bathroom was very cold, no soap until I asked for it, a very violent toilet flush and no proper space for toiletries. The worst thing was the wall socket that tried to escape from the wall each time I unplugged the hairdryer. Room service breakfast was very good as was housekeeping (apart from the soap) and along with a previous reviewer I have to say the cheerful doormen were absolutely wonderful - helpful with directions, calling taxis, always there to open doors and so on, rarer than you might think.Overall I think this hotel is overpriced at $800 a night. The location is great and it's OK for a shopping trip, but at that price you expect a luxurious base to get ready for a party and the rooms simply didn't pass muster."
85,1913,"Jan 1 2008 	Just awful	I had to travel to New York for business and my husband and infant daughter came along with me. This hotel was booked by the company that flew me out, so fortunately we didn't foot the bill.We had a bad experience from the moment we stepped in the door. We arrived exhausted at around 11pm. The registration is one level up from the ground floor and the concierge on the ground floor was extremely snappy to us when we mistakenly took him for the check-in desk. We then went up to the check-in desk and the two men behind the counter gossiped with each other for a full minute before even acknowledging our presence.Our room was minuscule which we weren't too surprised by, it being New York. But the smallness was exacerbated by the large, unattractive wardrobe that took up half the floor space, and several large and useless pieces of furniture that were obviously meant to be decorative. With a room that tiny I would have appreciated just a simple desk and chair. Once our portable crib was set up we could not walk across the room -- we had to climb over the bed to get from the desk to the bathroom. It was extremely uncomfortable.The bathroom was good-sized and pleasant. Their shampoos and soaps were very nice. What was not nice was the fact that all of the toiletries sitting on the ledge above the sink were covered in shaving cream splatters -- apparently the hotel has splurged on fancy amenities but doesn't change them between guests.But what really made this stay one of the most unpleasant I have had was an experience we had as we returned to the room in the evening. The hotel was hosting a party on one of the upper floors and the elevators were blocked off with a velvet rope. The area was fairly empty, with just two enormous bouncers standing there. We waited for over five minutes for the one remaining elevator to open. My husband (carrying my seven month old daughter) finally tried to enter one of the newly &quot;private&quot; elevators and a bouncer bellowed at him &quot;SIR, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BOARD THAT ELEVATOR!!!&quot; My husband said &quot;But I'm a guest at this hotel&quot; and the bouncer yelled &quot;I DON'T CARE!&quot; I actually thought for a second that the bouncer was going to strike my husband -- he was very threatening. This incident reflected the attitude of the entire hotel. You could stand there for forever with an infant trying to get up to your room and the hotel is more interested in catering to a party whose guests haven't even arrived yet. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The service was horrible and nothing about it is particularly nice. The doormen, however, were friendly and helpful."
86,1913,"Dec 1 2007 	Very hip decor I saw Adrian Brody!!!	I stayed at this hotel for one night to attend my firm's event in New York. The room (corporate rate was $559) was stylishly furnished, but very small. There was an armoire, a queen size bed, two side tables and lamps, a small table with the usual goldfish in a bowl (though my fish was dark gray :)), a flat screen TV, a DVD player, and a standing lamp. The bed linens were very nice. The bathroom was not large, but sufficient for one person. Malin &amp; Goetz toilettries were provided (shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body lotion). I think the hotel should also provide cotton balls, a sewing kit, etc.I ordered room service breakfast, which was delivered a bit later than requested, but was good (I had the egg white frittata with vegetable ratatouille and whole grain toast).A big plus for me was the self service coffee/tea/hot cocoa machine on my floor. Though the quality was not high, the free beverages were very convenient. Plus, I typically carry my own tea bags with me, so I only really needed hot water.The first level and the lobby (which is on the second floor) were decorated exactly as you would expect in a hip NY hotel. I really liked the old style elevators, the metal staircases, and the bar area.Plus, as I noted in the title, I saw Adrian Brody, who is absolutely my favorite actor ever!!! I would return to this hotel, but only if I found a good deal. I definitely did not think it was worth anywhere near the $660 rate paid by my company."
87,1913,"Nov 28 2007 	Great location not as great as it looks on the website..	This hotel is in a great location if you want to be right in the Soho/Tribeca area. It's a boutique hotel and I think likes to think it's uber cool, with a trendy bar and urban look and feel to it. As there are not many hotels around here we chose it and although it served our purpose location-wise, I'd say it's a bit overpriced and the rooms are quite compact."
88,1913,"Nov 18 2007	Overpriced overhyped	The very smart gentlemen on reception gave us warm towels to freshen up with, but just when I thought we were going to get a glass of champagne too they discovered, on going to the open bottle behind the till, &quot;no glasses!&quot; and did nothing to find some, so no champagne for us. The rooms were tiny. The view was of a building site opposite. The cleaning woman had left a card telling me who it was who'd cleaned my room; she'd also left beside the card the dirty rag she'd been doing the cleaning with, presumably so I'd know she'd been hard at it. The bar was noisy, brash and inhabited by people with more money than sense, with a smattering of idiots thrown in for good measure. I'm ashamed to say we joined them later on and fitted in well. The main bright spot of this otherwise overpiced, overhyped hotel was the staff outside the front door, who were uniformly polite, cheerful and helpful, pointing out the (wonderful) Pepolino restaurant just up the road when we needed somewhere to eat."
89,1913,"Nov 12 2007 	Fawlty Towers in Prada....	Yes it's true, New York City's hotel rooms are at times on the small side. It's also true to say that at times, even the best hotels can disappoint a jet lagged, tired guest. And yes, it's also fair to say that at times, hype can get the best of us. The Mercer was full so I tried my luck at the Soho Grand. My first and last stay at the Soho Grand combined a tiny cookie-cutter room with completely hopeless customer service and a feeling that the hype brings many first timers and few repeat customers - but as they say, &quot;fools and money....&quot;Location: Great for Soho, not as good as the Mercer, but most of the commercial fun in Soho and surrounds is within walking distance and travel to the hotel from the aiport is easy.The Checkin: Lets face it, the price of top-line hotel rooms has skyrocketed all over the world in the last four years. In some cases spending the money is a joy and in others you feel completely abused. After negotiating my way through the six porters and doorman all of whom were doing nothing but their hair, I entered through the dim, urban lobby and signed my life away on a room rate of a purely insulting $780 per night - good thing I have two kidneys, one is now for sale... This was only after &quot;Sascha&quot; (yes, how typical) had finished her flirtatious interlude with an elderly gentlemen while keeping five guests waiting in line. Conclusion: Checkin is a glamor job fielded by 'trendy', slightly clueless &amp; unprofessional staff who are a touch on the rude side. In short, these guys are glorified cashiers ringing the till and gelling their hair. You get none of the 'chop-chop' and impressive attention to detail from more professional outfits here. The staff want to spot a celebrity so that they're 'with it' everyone else is chopped liver. So having established that the first impression was basically a joke and having my expectation for the room 'managed down' well, we headed upstairs...The Room: Fortuntely there was an area near the ceiling where a piece of rope would have supported my body weight - such was the disappointment. This room looked like somewhere depressed single dudes come to die, or where hookers come to do trade. Cheap, Best Western setup. $780 for a Deluxe King room bought us a (truly) miniscule bathroom, a dirty carpeted floor, a few cheap lamps and bedside tables, a flat screen TV that didn't work, scuffed walls and a very mean little bed. My heart sank as I surveyed the room as I was truly hoping for something special given the great location and price. Strangely, about one quarter of the floor area was taken up a closet like installation which stuck out from the wall, this enroached on the already small room and increased the sense of tight containment - alas I felt like a Soho cockroach in a glass jar. I called down to reception to see if we were given the right room category. After the phone was left on the desk for 3 minutes while the attendant checked (god knows what in that amount of time) I was informed that I had actually been upgraded. Too tired to bother with sarcasm, I hit the shower. Bathroom: Worth a special mention here as a fantastic bathroom can easily make a room and a stay that much more special. In this case, small, cheap &amp; nasty says it all. After 5 seconds in the bathroom I had visions of a mean little hotel baron dressed as the little man with a top hat from Monopoly screaming at his managers 'cut all costs and maximize profits!'. There were no toileteries other than three little bottles of super new age &quot;we hurt no monkeys making this product&quot; body gel and shampoo. The toilet seat was off its hinges. No shower cap, no cotton buds, no bath slippers, only 1 little robe, no cotton wool, no comb, none of the regular things you rarely use, but find comfort in being there and make you feel just a litte bit special. On the plus side, the shower over bath had good water pressure - little problem though, if you have a high pressure shower, make sure you have drainage that can cope with it. Sure enough, after 30 seconds, the bathtub was 3/4 full and I was pretending to be a vietnamese farmer wading through monsoonal rice paddies - &quot;Diddy Mao!&quot; I called this one down to housekeeping and they informed me that in fact the drainage was fine, it wasn't broken and that it was normal - clearly American Idol was mesmerizing that evening as it seemed no one wanted to work for the guests (If only my Doctor could give me an over the phone checkup like this...) Oh by the way and yes you guessed it, the plastic shower curtain (yes plastic) did cling to my body and ofcourse, there was mould around the edges of it. Rather unfortunately, the power outlets DID have safety switches so dropping the hair dryer into my rice paddy bath did not kill me. Truly a shame by this point. The food: Did not trust the kitchen after seeing dirty knives and forks, very wilted lettuce and tired looking food. In short, unimaginative and awful scrapings from Soho gutters. Enough said.Concierge: A really simple job here. Concierge (yes with the by-now-customary five person queue at his/her desk) points towards the shops &quot;over yonder&quot;. Anything else forget it. These guys just don't care and don't have a clue compared to switched on concierge desks like The Peninsula in mid town and The Mercer in Soho. Once again for this place, the emphasis on hiring young (and cheap), trendy looking staff comes wayyy ahead of hiring competent people. Conclusion: Checkout said it all to me. Once again a queue of 5 people and a 10 minute wait standing in the lobby. No &quot;we'll be just a minute&quot; or &quot;thanks for waiting, how can I help you&quot;. Far from it. They just took the money and offered very little in return. This place is basically a honey trap; first timers and the curious will go and rarely return. Suckers with no appreciation for what service and quality actually is will surely come back. Value for money was non-existant, staff totally hopeless and too few of them, almost no efficiency, dirty scuffed walls and cheap looking rooms supposedly covered up by an expensive fit out downstairs and trendy kids playing &quot;hotelier&quot; for a few years before moving into the media or arts world. Burn this dump to the ground, collect the insurance check and build something that gives guests a feeling of excitment, value and slick prestige. The tradition of Soho has given alot of its sould away to commercialism over the years, the least such commercialism can do then is to honor such a special part of the world by attempting to enchant its guests, not pillage them. Management clearly has alot of work to do here. Oh yes, getting a cab to the airport took 45 minutes despite the six doormen/porters/concierges milling around the outside. Prognosis: Marginally preferable over a park bench and newspapers...I would get more joy smoking bad weed with the $100 bills I used to pay for this place...Where instead: Book the Mercer. Great food, Great location, relliable, big rooms, great bathrooms, smart concierge, smooth checkin/out. Can't go wrong. If The Mercer is full, try Soho House. If no joy there, try a new one called The Bowery."
90,1913,"Oct 18 2007 	Sweet hotel in a great location	SoHo Grand is a great hotel to splurge on. It's perfectly located at the bottom of SoHo. Plus, it's close to several subway lines. The staff was very friendly. Rooms were a reasonable size for NY. Beds were very comfy. Our room had a great northern view of the city. They offer to bring a Bose iPod dock to the room. Also, I like the apples in the lobby to snack on. Very cool atmosphere. I'd definitely stay again if I felt like splurging."
91,1913,Oct 4 2007 	Grand Hotel but way overpriced!!	Stayed at the Soho Grand for 3 nights. Very nice lobby and bar area. The rooms were very clean and very small. Overall I liked the hotel but it is overpriced.
92,1913,Sep 20 2007	Enjoyed but not worth the price	We stayed here last July. It was a nice hotel but definitely not worth the price. The room was cramped. The front desk was a little snotty..
93,1913,"Sep 3 2007 	So So Soho	Nothing grand and nothing terrible about the Soho. Room was adequate but furniture was worn. Could use better lighting. Staff friendly enough. Room service sandwich was fine. Room faced construction across the street. All in all, an OK hotel but nothing more."
94,1913,"Jul 27 2007 	Cool hotel in coolest location ""Sure it was grand""	My wife and I stayed four nights in the Soho Grand in March 07. From our very large bed, above the flat screen tv, to the left of our goldfish &quot;Sammy&quot; and to the right of the iPod supplied by the hotel, we had a view of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings. At check-in we each were handed a glass of champagne and were made feel very welcome. The lobby of the hotel is very cool. In fact the interiors throughout the hotel are very well designed. The food in the bar was good, and the staff very friendly and helpful. We loved it there are would definitely stay there again. But the best thing is the location - Soho is the best. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in New York. Wandering around the shops and bars in this trendy neighbourhood was our favourite thing about New York."
95,1913,"Jul 20 2007 	'Just Perfect'	The whole stay was fab.Booked to stay here for 7 nights over the New Year Period. From the minute we arrive to the minute we left everything was perfect. All staff were very friendly and full of knowledge of the City, nothing was too much trouble, they made the perfect arrangements for a heleicopter ride over the City and to see the Lion King on Braodway for us. I would recomend this hotel to anybody going to New York and will be returning there in the not too distance future."
96,1913,"Jul 14 2007	Impeccable Service	This was our second stay at the Soho grand. The service was impeccable, people could not seem to do enough for us, from the manager, who changed our room and upgraded us when the a/c did not work, to the room service people. And of course, the location cannot be beat and the linens are fantastic. BUT, the rooms are very much in need of fixing up. Our bathroom ceiling was peeling and the room ceiling desperately needed paiting. We were in an executive king which is bigger by not much than the regular king and oddly enough contains no additional furniture. There is no desk, just one small table that barely fits a tray from room service. One small desk chair, and a small, uncomfortable arm chair and that's it. So would I stay there again? For a decent price for the executive king, I might. But I am more likely to go back to the Bryant Park which, althogh not in Soho, is maintained beautifully with good sized rooms."
97,1913,"Jul 7 2007	Nothing Grander than the Soho Grand!	I have been a Soho Grand fan for many years. Everyone in the hotel is consistently professional, maintain upbeat attitudes and are always helpful and courteous. The commitment to keeping the property in perfect condition is evident. The location works out wonderfully for me with its close proximity to the Holland Tunnel. The winning factor for me in the beginning was that it was the only hotel to not give me any resistance to accommodating my 150lb Great Dane. He was always made to feel like a guest and that made traveling so much easier for me. I have never stayed anywhere else since.I have been recommending it for over 5 years now."
98,1913,"Jul 3 2007 	Another Fantastic Stay at the Grand	I have stayed at the Soho Grand several times, and have always been impressed. My wife and I just returned from our most recent trip. The hotel is in a fantastic location in Soho and within walking distance to several other great areas. It is the place to be. I have stayed at boutique hotels all over the world, and the Soho Grand definitely measures up. The front desk was great and the concierge was full of helpful information. One tip however: make sure to stay in a King Size room."
99,1913,"Jun 29 2007	Lovely hotel shame about the bratty concierge	The soho grand is, basically, cool: great rooms (tiny but hey this is new york) lovely chic slightly retro decor, a doorman who is charm personified (someone please give him his own TV show), terrific food, a general ambiance of laid back exclusivity and so on - everything you'd expect from a 5* hotel. The concierge was the only thing that let it down: offhand, abrupt and basically a pain - he also said twice that he'd booked something for us and the restaurant then had no record of it. once is forgiveable but twice is kind of bad, no? we started dreading talking to him after i stood at the desk for five minutes - alone - waiting for him to get off the phone, acknowledge me or even look up from the doodles he was making on his pad (he knew i was there - i was half a metre away!). i think he was new. someone, please, get rid of him. he's the reason we're staying at the mercer next time. oh, and please get ipod docks for every room. everywhere else has them...by the way, highly highly recommend employees only for drinks and schillers for dinner. both seriously good."
100,1913,"Jun 24 2007 	Not my first choice in NYC ... better value elsewhere	Can't beat the lobby/reception area. The design is unique and while not warm or inviting, it's distinctive and memorable. Everyone knows that NYC hotels are small, rarely very clean and the bathrooms typically have room for significant improvement. My rooms in the Soho Grand have always been a bit more spacious than others in the city. But they are pretty spartan and could use another chair or something as you're either sitting at the desk or on the bed. The value is just out of whack in NYC as for $500/night I expect something truly remarkable. The Soho Grand is just average ... with below average service at the front desk (same for room service) and in the lobby lounge."
101,1913,"Jun 18 2007 	Great hotel. Pet friendly	We booked the hotel on the recommendation of our children living in the City as well as searching the internet for pet friendly locations. The welcome was cordial and our request for room type was honored completely. The style of the hotel fits our taste and the room was spacious enoungh for my wife and I as well as our two 20+ lbs. dogs, Pet beds and stainless steel bowls were waiting for the dogs in the room. If you like the Soho/Tibeca area it is a perfect choice. I am unsure why others writing reviews on Trip Advisor had such a poor experience. It was both Father's Day Weekend as well as our 40th wedding anniversary and I can't imagine a nicer place to celebrate a special occasion in New York. We surely will stay there again."
102,1913,"Jun 14 2007	Loved the Soho Grand	Even though I live in NYC, I was looking for a fabulous place to take my husband for our anniversary and found it at the Grand. The staff was highly attentive and the room wonderful. When I called and asked about discounts they explained about their loyalty program - all good stuff, didn't cost extra and it got us a discount! While we were celebrating our 3rd anniversary - the entire family came (including our 1 year old and our 7 year old dog). They made each and every one of us feel at home.We took advantage of it all - grand kids, dogs, the gold fish - and just loved it."
103,1913,"Jun 13 2007 	The worst 	For over $600/ night, our expectations were high. Boy, were we disappointed. The plumber had to come to the room 3 times because the toilet didn't work. The shower head was so low I had to bend down. The room was not clean. The front desk people were snooty. The closet in the room was like a fold up partition. What a disaster!"
104,1913,"Jun 12 2007	Really Good Could Have Been Better	We heard good things about the hotel, we like staying downtown and the internet price was great; much better than other hotels in the same category. We booked two rooms online on a Sunday morning, and showed up at about 7:00 P.M. that evening at the hotel. There was no bell man at the door offering to take our luggage, although this is admittedly a theoretical concern for us on this trip, since we were staying for just one day and had only minimal luggage. But things got worse when we got to the front desk. The person there could find no record of our reservation in the system. He acted like he didn't know what to do, and seemed ready to send us away, but I had my blackberry with me and had the confirmation emails and confirmation numbers for both rooms. I showed him the emails and gave him the confirmation numbers. He still couldn't find the reservations, and seemed unsure what to do. Finally, he asked one of his colleagues, who apparently advised him to call somebody that deals more directly with online booking. Finally, after about 15 minutes of waiting, our reservations were found. Here's what the employee helping us said: &quot;Well, you do have a reservation.&quot; Of course, we knew that, because we had our confirmation numbers. I think this person must have been new. He wasn't malicious or rude (at least in my mind); he was clueless, but my wife but ready to jump across the desk at him. If he's new, the hotel should have a big &quot;trainee&quot; sign clipped to his lapel, and somebody supervising more carefully what's he's doing. Also, it's not the employee's fault that the online system works so poorly. His problem was the way he dealt with it. Seems to me this would take only minimal training. Maybe the hotel should upgrade its online booking system? If I book a room at 11:00 A.M., and the system hasn't swept it into the hotel reservation system 8 hours later, that seems like software that doesn't work very well. Finally, our room was great. Our only complaint about the room is the TV, which had two, confusing remotes. For reasons that I still can't explain, depending on which remote I used, sometimes the TV would stay on for just a few minutes and then the screen would go dark, although the sound would continue. By experimenting with both remotes, I finally got it to stay on, but I'd have to be there for several more hours to replicate what I did. Again, the room price was good, but for $300 + a night, one expects decent customer service and a TV that works without an instruction manual. The checkout people, concierge and bell/valet people were great on the day we checked out. Hopefully, our entry experience was just a fluke."
105,1913,"Jun 7 2007	Looks fancy but isn't great	Entering the Soho Grand I was very impressed. It looks amazing, and the service is classy. Once I got to my room, I was disappointed. Now I did stay in the cheapest room they have, but still it cost between $400 and $500 a night.I got the basic room, and it was small. My last stay in a basic room was a Residence Inn &quot;Studio&quot; room in Austin Texas, and it was huge for a single.I sat down for a rest, and the TV remote didn't work. I turned the TV on with the buttons on the set, and the TV wasn't getting a signal. They had to come in and totally replace the TV set.As they were replacing the TV set, I turned on my laptop to get on the internet. Their wifi asks you to sign up, which is fine, but then tells you that you have to pay for the internet. I still signed up, but then it wouldn't let me get online. I had to call a 1-800 number to get online. A day later I couldn't get online again.The biggest surprise was when the power went out in our room. The phone is electric, so I couldn't even call downstairs to tell them. My wife and I were late for something, and were freaking out. I got out my cell phone, and called the 1-800 number for the Soho. 15 minutes later they must have switched the breaker and it came back on. They said that this can happen sometimes. This is just crazy.The service is great here, and the design of the interiors is excellent. Unfortunately, I don't think the facilities are in very good condition. My Studio room at the Residence Inn was 10 times more luxurious than this room, and was about 1/3 of the price."
106,1913,"Jun 6 2007 	Dreadfull! Give it a miss.....	I had heard that the Soho Grand was one of New York's hip hotels and that was my initial impression. Interesting architecture, a stylish lobby, bar and lounge area and excellent service from the bell boys, concierge and reception. However, it is clear that the hotel is only interested in catering to the 'beautiful people' that hang out in its public areas since the bedrooms were no better than those you'd find in the cheap motels around Times Square. I'd booked a Executive King room ($548 (including tax)) which was described on the hotel's website as follows: &quot;In a City where space is always a luxury, Executive King guestrooms are open and airy with high loft-like ceilings and large spacious bathrooms&quot;. Nothing could have been further from the truth. The room was neither stylish nor comfortable. It was dark and dingy with a low concrete ceiling and so small that it could only just accommodate a Queen sized bed. There was no cupboard, just a small alcove only big enough to hang half a dozen items, covered by a shabby curtain. The air conditioning was old fashioned and so noisy it was impossible to use at night. The window blind and curtains were made from moth eaten sack cloth. When I informed the hotel manager of my disappointment with the room I was told that &quot;we cannot cater to the aesthetic sensibilities of all our visitors&quot;.A 'free' breakfast consisted only of juice, coffee and pastries and the tray was left unceremoniously on the floor outside our room where we discovered it several hours after we had ordered it.There a many stylish hotels in New York. The Soho Grand is not one of them."
107,1913,"Jun 4 2007 	Not Worth the Pain	You are better off taking your $500 per night and investing it. The rate of return for this hotel is -100%.After checking in and heading to our room, I needed to use the bathroom. I had to hold the toilet seat up to urinate. The room had 2 towels and one glass even though I was there with my fiance. The pressure in the shower was akin to a leaking hose. When calling Guest Services, the line rang multiple times. The front desk said we could move rooms, only to call back and say that nothing was available. The bellman cut my fiance off while she was getting on the elevator. Ladies and guests first always! I mentioned it to the bellman and he laughed at me and said in a bizarre tone he would remember to do that next time. I could go on...But the kicker is the manager sent me to this link for the review. I called him first to give him my review. Guess what? He no longer works there. Shocker.The two saving graces were the concierge Annlore who ordered beautiful flowers for my girl and the location of the hotel.If it wasn't for my impending proposal to my girl the day after we checked in, we would have bounced to the myriad of fine hotels in Manhattan.Remember: We are revenue, they are overhead. Without travelers like us, the Soho Grand would be out of business."
108,1913,"Jun 4 2007 	Terrible First Time Experience	The Hotel staff is EXCELLENT, they go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable, on the other side, the hotel policy, etc. uses this to their advantage by over charging you for any Concierge assistance and in some cases 150% more than you would have paid for making arrangements yourself. Example for $120.00 a piece Wicked tickets I could have purchased on the Internet they charged me $325.00 a piece. Also they charged me $146.00 for transportation from the airport to their hotel and after speaking with the cab drivers they informed me of the problems they are having with the hotels and it is against the taxi commission for the hotel to do this, etc. When i checked out of the hotel I got into a cab outside the hotel and it only cost me $45.00 to get to the airport and that included tip and toll! I was always under the impression that The Concierge was provided to the guest of the hotel for assistance this is not the case at this hotel. I just wanted future guest to BEWARE....if you use the Concierge expect to pay 100% or in some cases even more or any service they arrange for you! In addition to that I am sure they don't give those GREAT employees anything out of it so, be sure you still tip them! After all they are the ones doing the dirty work, not the hotel owners, etc.!!!!!! Once again, the Entire Staff from the front desk to the cleaning are Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
109,1913,"Jun 3 2007 	Soho Grand is great	Great hotel, stayed there with my 18 month old son, they were more than accomodating to his needs. Crib, diaper genie, highchair in the room, Burt Bees baby products and always a smile whenever they saw him. Fabulous location, he was with me in the hotel bar till midnight in his stroller and siting on the sofas and everyone was very welcoming, not a disapproving look anywhere. Rooms are a bit on the small side but nevertheless well worth the money, enjoyed our NY visit and the SohoGrand greatly."
110,1913,"May 31 2007	Seduction in Soho	Spent a night at the Soho Grand on the Seduction in Soho package - was very good. All staff very friendly and well-trained. Room was nice with a good view over the river. We would definitely stay againwhen in NYC. Price of water in room, however, is laughable. Don't buy it ($10 a litre)! Go down the street and buy it for $2.50!"
111,1913,"May 30 2007	Location is everything	I've stayed in many hotels throughout the city and love the SoHo Grand. On this trip we were greeted with a complimentary upgrade upon arrival which gave us a nice northerly view of the city. Although a few things could use some attention, coffee bars on each floor could use better quality coffee; we didn't spend a lot of time hanging around the hotel with south Manhattan right out the door.The hotel is exactly what you want in a boutique; clean and quiet with attentive service, great beds and above all perfect location.PS - They take dogs with open arms, and there is something nice about watching Fido stroll through the lobby."
112,1913,"May 30 2007	Romantic Getaway	My husband and I celebrated our Anniversary at the Soho Grand. What a perfectly romantic getaway. Every detail was delightful. Champagne, strawberries, chocolate and Breakfast in bed. I highly recommend the Anniversary package. Loved the pet golfish too!"
113,1913,"May 28 2007 	Loved Soho Grand	My husband and I stayed at The Soho Grand along with somefriends for a shopping trip. The accomodations were just what we were looking for:clean, very nice bedding, nice sleekdecor, and the service was excellent, and everyone was veryhospitable from the doorman to the bellboy. The location was awesome as well; right in the heart of Soho, close to everything.Would definitely stay again."
114,1913,"May 26 2007 	Felt Like a Million Bucks	From the moment we stepped into the place, my girlfriend and I felt taken care of. The decor is stunning and the staff is efficient, friendly, and very helpful without being intrusive. We were served cool face cloths at the reception desk, which helped take the edge off the NYC spring heat. We arrived earlier than general check-in, but were immediately let into our room because it was ready. The bug-eyed goldfish swimming in a bowl outside our door was an exotic treat. It kept us company for the length of our stay.The room, tasteful, restful, classy. The concierge -- completely on top of it. If you want to treat yourself to how the other half lives, I wholeheartedly recommend a short stay at the Soho Grand. Beware, though. Paparrazzi can ambush you outside the doors, waiting for a celebrity pic."
115,1913,"May 20 2007	Overpriced little value	Have stayed at a variety of hotels, all well under the 600.00 USD per night I payed at the Soho Grand, and had a much better experience. The hotel overall looked dirty, and needs some money injected into it. The fact that smoking is allowed at all I was quite surprised at in this day and age. I was most shocked at however the small amenities missing such as no coffee machines in the room (the fact that I saw a guest in her pajamas having to leave her room to go down the hall for a coffee from a coffee machine), no ironing boards, and no morning paper. When I checked out no one asked how my stay was, even after I asked for a comment card...I now know why!"
116,1913,"May 14 2007 	Excellent Stay	Had heard bad reviews recently about the Soho Grand, but had good experiances there in the past. Stayed over the weekend and had a wonderful stay as usual. Beautiful room with a great view of NY. Attentive service, particularly at the front door."
117,1913,"May 14 2007 	little town blues melting away..	Fantastic location between the Village and Tribeca. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable with great views of Manhattan. The front of house staff are enthusiastic and incredibly helpful, from booking restaurants and recommending local bars etc, really couldn't do enough - genuinely made my stay special."
118,1913,"May 12 2007	Great stay at the SoHo Grand	My husband and I were staying with a friend in NYC and decide to splurge on a hotel. We called the SoHo Grande and the W Union Square. The SoHo Grande was so friendly and accommodating - they offered us 10% off our stay for signing up with their loyalty program and took our preferences - pillows, paper and our preferred welcome amenity (fruit, cookies, etc). Just to compare prices, we also checked wth the W Union Square and could not believe how expensive they were in comparison, and were by far not nearly as friendly. So, we chose the SoHo Grande which was a wise decision! We loved our stay - got a very nice room on the 11th floor with a lovely view of the Empire State and the Chrysler bldgs. My only disappointment was that we never received our welcome amenity or any other perks that were included - most likely due to our same day reservation. I'm sure we would have received them if we asked, but it would have been nice to have them without asking...not enough to warrant a bad review. I would hands down choose this hotel over any other I've stayed at in New York. Friendly service, comfortable rooms and reasonable prices...not to mention a great location in SoHo near tons of shops and restaurants."
119,1913,"May 12 2007	Well situated and well staffed	This hotel is especially good if you're travelling alone. To get a room large enough for two people is pricey. HOWEVER, this is hotel has a great location, smart, courteous staff, and is very service oriented.I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
120,1913,"May 11 2007 	fun and good with kids	Third time I stay there, first with my kids, a two year old and a four year old. Staff was very firendly. Got a fishbowl in the room. Concierge got us a babysitter. Overall, a great stay. Will return."
121,1913,"May 3 2007 	Great location and excellent service	I've just returned from a five night stay at the Soho Grand Hotel. The hotel is well positioned to great eateries and shops in SoHO - a short walk to China Town and the trendy Tribeca area. The subway is also only a 5 minute walk away and taxis like the rest of the city are in abudance here. The rooms are small but that's nothing unusual where space is at a premium plus there's so much to do in New York you're not going to be spending much time in your room so this shouldn't put you off. The rooms are slightly dated, but clean the beds and pillows are amazing. They were so plush and comfortable I'm sure my I fell asleep as my head hit my pillow. A Bose iPod speaker dock which is stated on the hotel website as one of the room amenties is only availble on request from reception for small deposit. But because of the problems I had with returning the item (you have to call for someone to collect on check-out) its probably not worth the trouble. I never bothered requesting the gold fish.Breakfast is available at the hotel at an extra cost and you are expected to have it in your room. I couldn't imagine anyting worse considering the size. Luckily the hotel is close to so many great eateries, that we ate out every morning. Balthazar is only a 15 minute walk away on Spring Street , and was a great place to sit and people watch.The staff at the hotel are extremly polite and knowledgeable. We experienced no problems that other reviewers have reported in the bar. But word of advice if you do intend to sit and drink in the bar is that it's worth smartening up - I've learnt that you can never be over dressed in this city.All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Grand and would definitely go back. I would recommend the hotel to second-time visitors who've already done all the sights, and just want to experience New York as New Yorkers do."
122,1913,"Apr 29 2007 	Excellent service good location	What more can I say? Excellent service, Couldn't do enough for us. Well located. Would highly recommend this hotel for couples, singles or business. Really great all rounder"
123,1913,Apr 22 2007 	Good location but we like The Mercer Hotel better	Our daughter goes to NYU so when we go for a weekend we like to stay in the Soho/Village area. Hotel choices are limited. We tried the Soho Grand this time since The Mercer was full. The Soho Grand is certainly adequate. I found the staff to be helpful and efficient -- no complaints. The public areas of the hotel were also OK although the feel was a little run down. The room was also OK -- the usual small NYC room. I will say the bed was very comfortable. So while everything was OK we still like The Mercer better. The Mercer has a good restaurant and I think the rooms are nicer. But -- all in all the Soho Grand is a good choice if you want to be in the Soho area. I just can't rave about it. We've also stayed at the W on Union Square. A nice hotel but I don't like the Union Square area as well.
124,1913,"Apr 9 2007	Disappointing	I have stayed at the Soho Grand a number of times over the years, including both personal and work related visits to NYC. All of the previous stays were above average. However, my wife and I stayed for two nights, April 6 and 7 and we were very disappointed. Both the service and the hotel are &quot;dated&quot;. We experienced problems with the Concierge, Guest Services and the Hostess at the bar. Generally, the service was one of disinterest. One example was when the Bar Hostess informed us that the reason that we could not secure a sofa for a drink in the bar was that there was a Soho Grand Manager's Meeting and the Managers would be using several sofas following their meeting. I asked if this meant that the employees took precedent over the guests and she basically said yes.The Furniture in the rooms and the common areas is worn and dirty. There were numerous other examples of lapses in service such as misplaced luggage, three requests for the Bose iPod Docking station before it appeared, three requests for luggage racks, etc., etc.The Sunday New York Times included an article stating that Terry Fant, the CEO of Soho/Tribeca Grand Hotels typically reviews all of the TripAdvisor reviews. Hopefully, he will not miss this one. Ironically, we had to chase down the Sunday New York Times as it was not delivered as promised."
125,1913,"Apr 3 2007 	Fantastic Location	Fantastic location, convenient to shopping and great restaurants. We booked the Deluxe King room for 4 nights - it was small, but not unreasonably so for 2 people. The room was clean and comfortable with a great view of the city. I wasn't sure what to expect after reading other reviews, but every member of the staff that we encountered was friendly and helpful - and I never got the feeling that the property was understaffed. Check-in was fast and simple; room service was as scheduled. As one reviewer wrote, the tables in the lounge were marked &quot;reserved&quot; -- but we were immediately seated at a &quot;reserved&quot; table on a busy Saturday night (without reservations). Service at the bar and in the lounge were above average. There were nice touches, like cookies in our room at check-in, and a coffee/hot chocolate machine by the ice machine."
126,1913,"Apr 1 2007	This Place is Brilliant	Again, the people at [--] have come up trumps, I wanted to stay downtowon on this occassion, they gave me some info on hotels and picked this one out to meet my requirements. Well, what a hotel, when I walked in the place, it looked absolutely stunning, I walked into my room and was amazed by the standard of the furnishing, the room size and the equipment within it, so much so that I actually asked at reception if I had been upgraded, no, this was the entry level room and it was out of this world. I made use of the concierge during my stay, nothing was too much trouble and the advice given absolutely spot on and impartial. Upon my travels from this hotel (the metro on canal street is about 2 mons walk), I suddenly realised how accessable midtown is from a downtown location, you could get to 34th street in about 10 mins on the metro. For the price, you seem to get much more hotel for your money especially at weekends and you are close to take in the statue of liberty. The neighbour hood of soho is fairly interesting as well, heading north from the hotel, you come across designer stores and smart shops, go south and you walk straight to ground zero, east is china town, and a a bit further past china town is little italy, what more could you want from a location and midtown just 10 mins away but right out of the hussle. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
127,1913,"Mar 27 2007 	Sadly Disappointing	I read the reviews before leaving and having stayed at the Soho Grand several times in 2002 I was surprised by the negative feedback as I'd loved the hotel when I'd stayed there. I even called and spoke to the front desk and discussed the negative reviews which they believed were based on high prices giving guests unreasonable expectations of the hotel. So I decided to still book as I loved the location and could not decide based on reviews where else to stay! Upon arrival I was pleased to see how fabulous the main areas still are - although it was a little pretentious putting reserved signs on all the bar tables even though they were empty and even though I was a guest I literally had to beg for a table to sit at and just have a drink in the afternoon - which should be a given if I am staying at the hotel!! Anyway sadly worse was yet to come. We were showed to our Deluxe King room - I was absolutely appalled by the decor! We were paying $400 a night and the decor was that of a midwest Best western! Apparently I was told that $15,000 dollars had been spent on each room and they had tried to evoke the old Soho style - well I dont know who their design agency was but they conned you and had no taste!! There are so many talented interior designers how did they manage to choose a design agancy that totally destroyed the credibility and stylishness of the hotel!! I can imagine old Soho style and what I imagine is industrial, vintage, stylish, slightly quirky, good quality - not cheap, depressing and tasteless. The bathrooms were cute and had nice touches but the bedroom was a mix of shades of muddy brown, faded earthy orange, beige, plaster - yeuk! There were awful patterns all mixed together, brown and orange plaid mixed with swirly brown carpet. The blinds were hessian of some sort that had faded and looked cheap and old. The cupboards were made out of some hideously cheap chip boards and coated and just looked awful. The headrest was out of some kind of faux antiqued leather with studs - it was awful. And dont think this was just one room - they all have the same decor!!! I am so saddened ( I am a designer myself) that what was once a minimal and luxurious hotel has been utterley cheapened by poor qualiy tasteless design - this is not just a matter of differing tastes this is poor quality this is not luxury. We did change room to a corner room and I have to say it had the best view I've had in manhattan - but even so I had to leave I felt depressed and we had agreed to pay $400 on the basis that this would mean a luxurious trip - wrong!! We moved to the London New York - stunning modern art deco design - simply stunning!! But it's high rise and if you dont like big hotels we also stayed at Chambers ( make sure you have a room with a view over w 56th St!! there are big fans at the back not pretty!) - perfect in every way, cosy, stylish etc.During my trip I visited about 12 other hotels and I was surprised at how unimpressive and pricey they all are!! I also loved the new Bowery Hotel - the rooms were divine very Italian-especially the large King rooms with sliding panels that open up the bathroom onto the bedroom, mixed with a bar thats old english hunting lodge glamour!!! - but until they clean up Bowery a bit more I would not feel happy staying there as a single woman. Mercer of course is lovely too but too expensive for me! Hope that helps!!"
128,1913,"Mar 25 2007 	Management problems	We have just returned from a saturday night stay. We drove into the city approx. at 5:30pm.(thru holland tunnel which is about 10 blocks from hotel) called the hotel for directions and did not get to the hotel until 7:30pm because of wrong directions given 3 seperate times by hotel staff (concierge). The lobby is great place to hang-out for drinks and cool scene. Hotel room and bathroom was tiny--air conditioner and heater did not work. Asked for walking directions from concierge to restaurant reccomemended by concierge and directions again were wrong. We were told that we needed to give valet 30 minutes lead time to retrieve our car , did so, then had to wait another 35-40 minutes when we arrived because they did not respond to our first request (our friends we were with, never received their car and had to walk 2 blocks to the garage to get it themselves even after being told repeatedly that thier car was enroute). All in all the staff was very friendly but the staff especially the concirege did not have a clue to running an upscale effiecient hotel that caters to upscale clinentele."
129,1913,"Mar 24 2007 	Misleading event	We were guests at the Soho Grand Hotel for New Year's Eve and attended their Black and White Party. First, not everyone is dressed in black and white which they say they require. Second, not everyone is dressed in formal attire which they also say they require. Third, they will ask you to pay extra for reserved seating but they have none. Therefore, if you decide to attend the party, don't feel that you need to heed to any &quot;dress code&quot; requirements--they do not enforce them. Also, don't pay for reserved seating, because there is none. Even without the party, our experience was miserable. Service was poor and they even us charged us to use the internet. I suggest you stay at a Holiday Inn Express, where at least the internet is free!"
130,1913,Mar 18 2007 	Love The Soho Grand	The Soho Grand is absolutely fab!!! From the doormen to the housekeeping ladies. They are all great. I will reccomend any one to stay here.
131,1913,"Mar 13 2007	Interesting Interior Design	Myself and my fiancee stayed for 5 nights twixt Christmas and New Years, firstly I cannot emphasise how wonderful the location is, slap bang in the heart of the best bits of NY. On arrival the door staff were polite and attentive, check in took a while as they seemed a little under staffed. The room was nice, large enough and clean with a nice bathroom, the decor pleased. The only gripe with the hotel was trying to get a seat in the bar, tables were reserved, and the bar manager was quite rude in his quest to keep us out! As I waited in the lobby, the reserved tables remained empty. But I wouldn't let the one and only rude member of staff put me off staying again. Highly recommended for it's location alone."
132,1913,"Feb 23 2007 	Never Again	We were here the second weekend in February, and except for the attractive lobby and bar area, found it awful. The room was tiny and what little furniture there was looked like it came from an old college dorm. We asked to have a newspaper delivered in the morning -- none came. The noise from the lobby bar kept up awake until 3 a.m. (poor design), and the traffic noise was unusually loud for that part of town (lousy window insulation). Finally, when we checked out Sunday morning, we were told that we would have to wait 45 minutes for our valeted car ($45 for one night) to be delivered. In fact, it was out front in 10 minutes, but no one bothered to tell us. Never again!"
133,1913,"Feb 20 2007	The Grand is always great	This is probably our 5th time staying at a Grand Hotel but the first at Soho. All other visits were at the Tribeca Grand. Both hotels are exceptional - the staff could not be sweeter and always willing to make the guests comfortable - NO ATTITUDE.The weekend getaways are wonderful - they are a great value for the accomodations and service. Both have great hotel bars and drinks. And the location could not be better if you love downtown. Amazing restaurants, the BEST shopping and funky little theaters.We did find quite a difference in the atmosphere of the hotels. Tribeca is so much more laid back, almost sleepy compared to the Soho. Neither is better or worse than the other, it is pure preferance. The service might be better at the Tribeca Grand (a few extras were forgotten at Soho - this never happened at Tribeca) but I am only basing this statement on one stay at Soho. I am not sure if we always stayed at Tribeca on quiet weekends and then Soho on a crazy one, thus the difference - or there is consistantly a true difference. Anyway, we love the hotels and they will continue to be our place when in New York."
134,1913,"Feb 18 2007	Best Hotel in New York	We stayed at the Soho Grand for three nights in Feb 07. We found the rooms to be of high quality with many nice touches we had not expected. They were of a good size with Bose sound systems as standard, bath robes, slippers and a range of top CDs, flat screens TV's and a varied minibar selection of drinks and snacks. We arrived late on the first night due to flight delays from London. Check-in was a breeze. Our bags were delivered to our rooms. Our beds had been turned down and the Bose sound system was playing in the background. The room temeprature was perfect even though it was -5 outside. We didn't need to adjust it throughout our entire stay. It has to be said it is the first time I have returned home and found my bed to be less comfortable than those in the hotel. The Concierge and door men were very friendly and knowledgable assisting in booking restaurant reservations and recommending the best bars in the area. Taxis were always hailed within minutes of our request.Food was of a high quality both for breakfast and lunch (we didn't have the opportunity to sample dinner). The bar was often busy but not uncomfortably so and the business facilities within the hotel were perfect.All in all a very laid back but professional establishment and one I have already recommended to friends and associates as the place to stay when in New York. We will definitely be returning, hopefully for a longer stay in the future.Congratulations to Ian Nicholson, the General Manager, for maintaining such a high level of service at th hotel."
135,1913,"Feb 11 2007 	Needs more people	Amazing views, great place but they need more staff members.I waited at the bell desk, the front desk and the concierge desk while they worked with other guests. Had I seen a fully staffed desks (i.e. there were two positions at the concerige's desk, but only one person or three positions at the front desk but only one person) I would not be writing this kind of review. Had I see a fully staffed desk with a line, I would not be writing this review. Unfortunatley, I saw a skelton staff on thursday and friday nights, two prime night for a hotel like this.If you know what you want and how to get it, stay here. If you need help with your visit to NYC, then stay elsewhere"
136,1913,"Feb 8 2007	New Years at the Soho Grand	My girlfriend and I stayed at the Soho Grand over New Years as it was in close proximity to one of my friend's apartments. The hotel checkin was on the second level and no one seemed willing to help my girlfriend or I with either our bags or the door. This may have been because they were getting ready for a new years eve party and were indifferent to the guests staying in the hotel. Beyond the initial impression, the service at checkin was really easy and the woman at the front desk was very friendly, especially given the fact that she was working on new years. The hotel room was nice and spacious. The bed was very comfortable, but we were in the room next to the elevator, ask for a room further down the hall so as not to hear the beeps. Room service was so-so, but hit the spot after a night out. Overall, the hotel was in the area we wanted and fit the bill. We had booked two nights earlier and had gotten a good rate. There are nicer properties, but if business or pleasure put you in Soho, I would recommend the hotel."
137,1913,"Feb 2 2007 	Exceptional stay at the Soho Grand	I recently stayed four nights at the Soho Grand hotel and my stay was exceptional. I arrived *very* early on the day of my check in as I took an over night flight and was expecting to wait for my room as is customary with most hotels. I couldn't have been more pleased when the gentleman (very nice and personable Aussie) at the front desk made an adjustment and assigned me a room that was immediately available. I was thrilled and this act set the tone for my stay. The room was very clean, well appointed and had a great view from both windows. The house keeping service was exceptional: friendly, accommodating and most importantly, I never felt rushed to exit my room for daily cleaning. Every morning the hotel delivered a wonderful continental breakfast of various pastry and muffins as well as coffee and juice. I loved that you get to choose your breakfast arrival time and change your order daily - nice touch! The front desk and concierge were always helpful and friendly when I asked questions about local shops and locales. When I needed to ship some items back to San Francisco and needed the location for a local FedEx, the front desk offered to ship them for me - unbelievable!The only glitch in my entire stay was an errant fire alarm sounded at 3 am for quite some time. I thought a note under my door the following day would have been nice, but I know that may have been expecting too much for a true glitch with their system. My check out was very easy and the doormen and bell hops (bell men, really) arranged a car service to the airport for nearly the price of a Yellow cab. The Soho Grand does it again! Just great!All in all my stay was so wonderful, that the Soho Grand is now my default home away from home while I travel to New York from now on."
138,1913,"Jan 29 2007	Great location - nice rooms - friendly staff	We originally had reservations at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, the sister hotel of the Soho Grand, which is about 2 or 3 blocks South of the Soho Grand.The Tribeca Grand was very loud, and you can see my review at if you search for the hotel in Tripadvisor. We only stayed at the Tribeca Grand for one night, and we moved to the Soho Grand the next night. I was there for 2 nights on pleasure followed by 3 nights for business.The Soho Grand was for me a much better choice than the Tribeca Grand. The hotel seemed to have tourists, and business people staying there.I was primarily there for business and it was a good choice becuas of it's proximity to the downtown financial district (Wall St area), but it offered a lot of things to do and places to eat in the evenings.My room and the public areas were very clean, the bed was very nice (see picture) and the staff was unusualy friendly. I really have nothing bad to say about the hotel - sure, it was expensive but this is NY.Here are some picsbed: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/161/373977458_fbaeabec05_b.jpgroom:http://farm1.static.flickr.com/181/373974456_7d6c026193_b.jpgbathroom:http://farm1.static.flickr.com/174/373976041_403ab33d66_b.jpg"
139,1913,"Jan 29 2007 	Never again	The place looked great. That's the only nice thing I can say. The service was insanely bad. I am a frequent visitor to NY for work and usually stay near my office in Times Square. I will stick to the W, Royalton, or Westin Times Square where the rooms are bigger and nicer and I'm not treated like crap.I don't mind a little haughtiness, but I found the staff at Soho Grand to cross the line from haughty to seriously rude. I've lived in Manhattan- I know attitude and have a thick skin. I'm also a mid-20s woman with fashion sense and an expense account- I would have thought I'd be their target client."
140,1913,"Jan 19 2007 	OK but losing lustre	Our room was comfortable if small (the Grand chain has small rooms, but they're well laid-out and comfortable). Basically, it was fine, but I found that a lot of the small details were a little worn. The old-looking Dean&amp;DeLuca/Citarella stuff in weird little tins for $12 is less than appealing. However, the mini-bar selection is huge and funny. Nice shower stuff, very decent bathroom. Comfortable bed and nice linens as you would expect. Definitely wait for a deal. Neighborhood has become like a giant outdoor mall. Very convenient, though. Staff here are really pleasant."
141,1913,"Jan 19 2007 	Pretty Darn Good	We wanted to stay in a really great, funky, expensive boutique hotel in NYC for a short vacation. We picked this because it's in Soho near where we wanted to be and it wasn't as expensive as the W properties. It's really very charming. The rooms are small, but it's NY so what do you expect. The decor is cute, there are flat screens and stereos in the rooms too. The pillows are NOT soft but the bedding is good other than that. It's not much more than a decent Westin so it's worth the price, but dont' expect it to be as exciting as a W or another hotel like that. The bar/lounge is a happening little scene too and the overall location is fabulous for shopping and gallery hopping."
142,1913,"Jan 14 2007 	overpricedsmall rooms and serious attitude	We stayed in the Soho Grand just before Xmas and were sorely disappointed, the location is GREAT, really in the middle of one of the buzziest neighbourhoods in NY and seconds away from some of it's best shopping and restaurants,which is why we chose it.Unfortunately, that was about the only thing that was.Right from the beginning, the staff, including the doorman were really offhand and curt to the point of rudeness. The entrance, lobby, bar and restaurant area are great to look at,unfortunately, they seem to have spent all the refurbishment budget there and forgotten about the rooms. The rooms are small and shabby,when we got in, the curtains were stained and hanging off the curtain rail, everything was scuffed and stained, and it all looked like it'd been cobbled together by the &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; team, we called the manager and asked for another room, something newer with less wear and tear,we were curtly informed that these were the new rooms and that was that, no apologies or helpful suggestions. The thing is, that not only was the room tired and dingy, it felt and looked grubby, the cleaning staff is really not up to scratch at all.The bathroom was small but cleanish, although, it looked as if everything had been bought at Ikea and don't expect an American Power shower experience, there is one non-adjustable shower outlet over the bath and a plastic shower curtain - the shower head was covered with black,flaking gunge.The toilet wouldn't flush and we asked if they could send someone up and waited and waited, finally a guy arrived, poked about a bit and said it was fixed, it wasn't-I think it actally worked about one in four times. In fact, don't expect anything above the bare minimum of amenities,there isn't even a chocolate on your pillow or even a complimentary bottle of mineral water.We called down to housekeeping to borrow an adaptor, to charge a phone and were told we couldn't borrow one, but they would sell us one for $10.It all seems really miserly and mean in a hotel that is charging this amount of money- $550 a night + taxes. The doors to the rooms haven't been fitted properly, so every time someone shuts their door, it reverberates all the way down the corridor, it's noisy and there always seemed to be room service trays left along the corridor,the rooms hadn't been double glazed(hello!!!, this is New York- the city that doesn't sleep)so it's really noisy outside as well.. The staff simply acted as if they couldn't care less about their guests, there would be a 20 minute wait to get a waiter to pay enough attention to you so that you could order a cup of coffee and then another 20 minutes to actually get it.I ordered breakfast there one morning and it arrived after a wait and managed to be both cold and burnt - after that we just went out-I didn't want to spend another penny in the hotel. The concierge was rubbish, as well, we asked him to book a table at Pastis for 8:30 pm the next evening, and he said he would,we had no confirmation message, so the next morning we asked if it had been done, Oh! he said, hadn't we got a message?- No, Well they could only do a table at 10:30, so he'd just left it, we asked if he'd called again that day and he looked as if this was a completely new idea to him- he called and got us a table, but we found out when we arrived it wasn't in the restaurant as we'd asked, but the caf, which is much more tightly packed,so we cancelled and went somewhere else after all. The staff all seemed to be under the mistaken impression that because they work somewhere&quot;hip&quot; that this makes them somehow stars themselves and therefore feel they can treat paying guests with condescension and snottiness and a good dollop of New York attitude- all of which you are supposed to be tipping!. I couldn't recommend this as a hotel to stay in, as I said, the common areas are nice, so drop in for a drink at the bar,don't bother with food, everything I had was decidely mediocre.The area is wonderful and if you could get a really good rate and don't mind grubby rooms and lacklustre service, then it might be ok for you.The problem is that the New York hotel industry has been spoilt for far too long,they can keep the prices exorbitant and the service poor and people are still falling over themselves to come; so I guess there's not a lot of incentive to change anything. I love New York, I'll be coming back, but I definitely won't be staying here."
143,1913,"Jan 9 2007 	Great atmosphere fun and elegant at same time	We stayed 5 nights here after spending 2 at the Hotel Gansevoort. Both hotels were very good. We had a corner king room on a high floor which had a good view but was not as big as I hoped. The bathroom was cute but small and not very luxuious. Not always spotlessly clean either. But the shampoos and soaps were great! Had a bit of trouble with our stereo system too.....The rest was marvellous. The staff were very nice, the food and atmosphere in the bar was excellent. We got complimentary breakfast in bed which was a bonus + guaranteed high floor , free internet and other little perks for signing up as a Grand Guest (free). The new years party was great - delicious food and very good atmosphere, plenty to drink, good music. Not cheap but worth it. I can see why some people complain about the checking in but on the whole we found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. Will go again."
144,1913,"Jan 5 2007 	Great Hotel Exceeded Expectations	My wife &amp; I stayed at Soho Grand to celebrate our anniversary. We loved the hotel. The rooms were clean and well appointed. We were expecting a small room based on TripAdvisor reviews, but our room was plenty spacious (Deluxe King). The staff was very friendly &amp; accomodating. Concierge recommended &amp; made reservations at an excellent restaurant, Pepelino's, that is within walking distance of the hotel. The lounge was a great place to hang out at night &amp; drink martini's (BTW, the french fries were great too)! We got the 'Seduction in Soho' package which included breakfast in bed (eggs, croissants, fruit, juice, &amp; tea) &amp; was pretty good. Overall, we had a wonderful time &amp; felt that hotel truly exceeded our expectations."
145,1913,Dec 27 2006 	SOHO GRAND IS GREAT	My mom and I stayed here for a week before Christmas and loved it! The room was clean and the bathroom was pretty roomy for NY. We had a great view from our room. The staff was great and very helpful. Soho is a great area for shopping and food. I loved that is is away from the hustle and bustle of timesquare. This hotel is very quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel!
146,1913,"Dec 11 2006	Loved the location  rooms too small	We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights for which we had received a good deal. Since I had heard so much about the hotel (and seen the regular room prices) I had higher expectations. The room was very small, as was the bathroom. Ive traveled quite a bit and this, together with the fact that the air-conditioning unit was right next to the bed, was a little bit disappointing. The staff was very helpful  they recommended a very nice little restaurant which managed to impress our local NY friends. The lobby is great and it was nice to have free wireless (not inside the rooms) access. Overall it was a good experience, but we wouldnt go back there without a similar deal."
147,1913,"Dec 11 2006 	nice Hotel nice style nice location	I stayed at THE SOHO GRAND with my girlfriend for three nights.We like the hotel very much, the stuff is very friendly, the bar at the hotel is also very nice and the style of this hotel is the way i like it. MODERN !!The people staying at this hotel are also what we hope to be. For example we walked into the WALDORF ASTORIA and I was shocked when seeing the hotel guest: big groups of typical american tourists !!! (nothing against american tourists it would be the same if there have been german tourist groups of 30 or more people checking in).The only thing (as with most hotels in NY) the rooms a very small. The location is perfect for people like us, who also want to go out at night or do some other things than just sightseeing. My girlfriend loves Soho because of it nice shops.I would come back to this hotel next time"
148,1913,"Dec 10 2006 	pretty OK but pricy	The SOHO Grand is truly a nice place to stay. The only problem is that I find it overpriced. We reserved 2 weeks in front of our stay and had to pay $691 before tax, occupancy fee, state tax and so. The end price is almost $800! The room was on the 10th floor with a view to midtown which was very nice :) For such a price level I think WLAN or cable internet (which is both available) should be free for guests. There is business center which is free but once You have your notebook with You it would be preferable to stay in the room if you do not want to pay 10$ a day for the WLAN. The gym is nice. The Hotel bar is pretty nice and fine fo a drink if one wants to stay in the hotel. The location of the Soho Grand is very convenient for shopping in SOHO or for going out at night.I know that the SGH can be booked for about $320 for the same room, and would definitely not go again there for the price we stayed."
149,1913,"Dec 5 2006 	The worst hotel I've ever stayed in ! !	OK the location is good, the lobby is nice and the decoration is not bad but that's it.The rooms are ridiculy small the service is not bad, just terrible ! The concierge is desatrous. Every body working at the hotel is condescendant and pretentious. And our stay was very expensive ! Don't go to that hotel ! At any price !"
150,1913,"Nov 28 2006 	funky and friendly	the hotel is in a great spot and lots of good eateries, bars and shopping nearby. the room, especially the bed, very comfy and the room service particularly good - prompt, friendly and worth using. try the seduction in soho package with the american breakfast delivered to your room every day! the bar has a top atmosphere - very cool with good lighting and music. table service very good. the concierge was very helpful at booking a restuarant for us and the doormen equally so at grabbing us cabs. the room heating/air con was faulty though and check in was surly - the only 2 small points in an otherwise excellent stay.definitely recommend you go there without hesitation."
151,1913,"Nov 8 2006 	Great location good service shame about the rooms	Stayed at the Soho Grand primarily because of the location. I take several trips to NYC each year for both business and pleasure and love Soho.The Grand is in a fantastic area with tons of great restaurants, nightlife and shopping within walking distance. Safe and lively day and night.The bell, front desk and wait staff are gracious, efficient and pleasant. The restaurant and bar and especially the outdoor lounge are wonderful. The public areas are very modern and attractive.However, the room was sadly lacking. Teeny tiny even by NYC standards. I was shocked. Two people in the room and we kept bumping into each other. Very little space in the cramped bathroom. The decor was pleasantly minimalist and the toiletries top drawer but for $400 a night I expect to be able to stretch without striking my roommate. The room service staff were hardpressed to find a suitable space to sit our meal without tripping over our luggage or us. I doubt I'll be back and that's a shame."
152,1913,"Nov 1 2006 	Poor Value for the money	I travel fairly frequently to NYC for both business and pleasure. I had heard good things about this hotel, but I must say I was quite disappointed. The Lobby and dining areas were beautiful and chic. The meals we ate in these areas were very good-not great. The actual hotel room, however, was small and cramped. We stayed in the &quot;Grand Corner King&quot; room which was more expensive, yet only slightly larger than a normal room. When we opened our window, it served as a magnet for all of the cigarette smoke on the floor. With a few exceptions, I found the staff to be very aloof. Our $720/night, (plus taxes) room included an in-room continental breakfast. We scheduled it for 9 am, yet it took 3 phone calls to get it to us by 10 am. All in all, I might eat here again, but I definitely won't stay here again."
153,1913,"Oct 29 2006 	Great location but cramped rooms	The location can't be beat - SoHo is at your doorstep, with a half dozen subway options within a few blocks. But the standard room I stayed in was small, even by New York standards. I managed because I was traveling alone, but with two people it would have been difficult to move around. I had to almost turn sideways to get around the corner of the bed to the small desk and chair, and the bathroom is tiny as well. The carpet and furniture all showed signs of wear. On a positive note, the staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful, and the big bowl of apples by the elevator is a nice touch. The lobby is hip and elegant. In short, if you are looking for a place to lay your head at night - but not to hang out in - it's not a bad choice."
154,1913,"Oct 17 2006	Don't go there overpriced and disappointing	The chap at check-in was not that friendly or welcoming and, so not a good start. We had ordered the Romantic package which was a King Size room described as roomy and airy, with Champagne, rose petals for the bed, chocolate covered strawberries.I rang to confirm before booking that the room was roomy etc. It was not! It was very pokey and small and overlooking the hotels rubbish dump, plus you could actually see people from the hotel s windows walking around naked etc ( we were at an angle where you see one of the hotels wing). The curtains did not go right across the window and so getting out of bed was a bit embarrasing particularly as you could see people looking out of their window into yours!.I complained to the guest services manager about the size of the room but he would do nothing about it, my husband &amp; I felt conned. The complimentry breakfast was a joke, first you were supposed to have it in your room but where?? no room to eat except on the bed. After lots of phone cals and hassle the hotel allowed us to eat in the restaurant. We had no champagne on arrival which was part of the package, the strawberries/chocolate was a pot of choc, the rose petals made of paper in a jar by the bed. The same chap that checked us in was very off-hand, we had asked for a lady who also worked for the front desk and he said 'she is around the back' and then ignored us?The only good thing about the hotel was the location and the concierge but at $704 per night forget it.Don't fo there.Jackie O'Connor, England"
155,1913,"Oct 15 2006 	Very pleasant stay	I stayed at the SoHo Grand for business for 2-weeks in September. As it happened, my trip was during the Fashion/UN Weeks in New York, and the City was quite crowded. I checked in late in the evening, and when I arrived I was promptly greeted out front where my bags were taken and I was directed to the check-in area which was on the 2nd floor. The two gentlemen at the front desk could not have been nicer. I was thankful for the friendly faces and the glass of champagne which was immediately offered to me by one employee while the other took care of checking me in. By the time I had my room key, I was in a much better mood than when I had arrived, and was even offered a refill on the champagne to take up to my room.The bags did take awhile to get up to the room, but I'm not one to just sit and wait, stewing about the delay. Knowing that I was the only person that had checked in recently, I waited about 15 minutes before I telephoned the front desk. I had my bags in 5-minutes with an apology for the delay. The room was nicely appointed, typical New York in that the room was very small, but not a problem. If there was anything I wasn't crazy about, it was the armoire for the clothing. It was made of wood, so when I slid the doors to open it, it was kind of flimsy.The room had a flat panel TV as well as a Bose sound system alarm clock. There was no work desk, which was a bit of a problem for someone traveling for business, but the internet access in the room was wireless so I was able to get comfortable on the bed to work. There was a small, round table in one corner of the roof with a chair which could have been used for work, but I found it to be uncomfortable. I also never did find the in-room safe.Room Service was spotty, and quite expensive, but the expense is to be expected in New York, I suppose. I did have one morning where my breakfast order was promised within 30 minutes, but at 45 minutes I called downstairs and there had been a shift change and the morning person didn't receive the order. I had my order within 10 minutes of my call. The Tomato Basil pizza was very good, everything else I ordered was decent, but not memorable.Housekeeping was fine, not perfect but nothing worth complaining about. They were good about minding the Do Not Disturb sign on the door (not the case in many hotels I've stayed at). Every single staff member I dealt with was professional and accommodating.My room was on the 3rd floor, which I was prepared to complain about having read reviews complaining about noise, etc. I had no such problems. There was only one night in the 2-weeks I was there where sound from the bar could be heard in my room, but it wasn't enough to keep me awake or disturb my work. All in all, I would definitely stay at the SoHo Grand again if the location were convenient for my business purposes. If it hadn't been for the good location and the excellent staff, I might not consider this hotel anything special."
156,1913,"Oct 10 2006 	Good hotel in great location	This is the second time we've stayed at the Soho Grand, both times for long weekends in New York. I love the location, right on the doorstep of Soho's fabulous shopping district. The staff are slightly aloof but friendly enough, the service in the overpriced restaurant is inexplicably slow but for location it can't be beaten. Ask for a room on a high floor - we asked for a 'room with a view' and ended up on the 16th floor with a breathtaking view of the Cast Iron district with the Empire State Building in the distance. The place could do with a lick of paint but when you're chilling in the bar with a cocktail and people-watching, you can forgive the Soho Grand's minor faults."
157,1913,"Sep 20 2006 	Not worth it	We foolishly chose Fashion Week for a NY visit, so paid over the odds for a room in the Soho Grand. And no way was it worth it! We booked through the website to get the Grand Guest rate, 10% off, and what we thought were added extras. The complimentary breakfast either never arrived/was late/wrong, the other 'extras' are available to everyone.The hotel was also hosting runway shows and after show parties - all fine but they chose to erect a dome right outside guestrooms. That sums up the Soho Grand - guests not a priority, trying to maintain it's cool reputation most definitely is.Staff were friendly enough, but terrible service. Room fine, nothing special and a bit tired and dated. Certainly not a style hotel. All this and $450 dollars a night - there must be better deals in NY!"
158,1913,Sep 20 2006 	Where is the Customer service?	They are rude it's as simple as that.The only positive experience was making the reservation. But from checking in to trying to get the bill it was the ultimate in rude. And who wants to pay to be treated rudely?
159,1913,"Sep 12 2006	Star Treatment at the SoHo Grand	My husband and I stayed at the SoHo Grand in mid-July for an anniversary weekend. The property is in a perfect location for exploring SoHo, the Village, and the Meatpacking District. We found the staff to be friendly and accommodating, and were pleasantly surprised at how much fun they all were-no snotty attitudes. In fact, we did not encounter a single rude person during our first trip to New York. At the last minute, I asked the concierge to make reservations for us at Spice Market, which she did graciously and very quickly. We returned to our room one evening to a chilled bottle of champagne and a note from the GM wishing us well on our anniversary and welcoming us to New York and the SoHo Grand. The room was small (which we expected) but nicely appointed and the sound system and CD selection were a wonderful touch. I also joined their GrandGuest program online, then called the hotel for reservations-got a great deal for two nights. Will absolutely stay there on our next trip."
160,1913,"Sep 5 2006 	SoHo Grand? SoSo Grand!	Just returned from a 5 night 'Anniversary Package' stay in the SoHo Grand. The hotel is long on image but the service left a few things to be desired. The front desk staff (at least the guy I had to communicate with) seemed pretty surly, not rude just disinterested. When we checked out he just presented the bill told me that the ammount would be charged to my CC. He didn't ask if we had a nice stay did we have any complaints not even 'a thank you for choosing the SoHo grand'. Not very customer friendly.Housekeeping left a bit to be desired as they had not cleaned out 'our' room properly from the previous occupants. Finding a sex toy in the bedside drawer was certainly unexpected (I'm pretty sure it wasn't part of the package!!!) and the TV remote control needed new batteries too.The public area/lobby looks great but every time we went in we were escorted to an available seat by a leggy hostess and immediately presented with a food and beverage menu as if to say 'if you sit here you have to buy something'. In summary, nice hotel, trendy location, staff with attitude spoiled it."
161,1913,Sep 5 2006 	Be Prepared to Wait	Great hotel in a great location -- but the service is bad. No complimentary breakfast in the room each morning as promised. 45 minutes to check in and there was NO LINE. An hour delay for our bags to arrive from the lobby to the 15th floor. A hour to wait for wine glasses in our room. An iPod that never arrived but was charged $491 to our room. Express charges for drycleaning that arrived 4 hours too late. &quot;Cool&quot; should not mean &quot;slow and unresponsive.&quot;
162,1913,"Sep 1 2006	Fun and hip	We stayed here a while back, and it was a great place to stay.You can't beat Soho for fun and energy, and this hotel is in the heart of it. The hotel room wasn't huge but it's very clean, and the bed was comfortable. The rooms also had complimentary kiehl's toiletries.The bar downstairs was good, though the food could have been better. My mother and brother recently stayed there and my mom said much the same. Other than that, the staff is great and helpful. If you drive to NYC. prepare to pay 40 bucks to park. All in all, enjoyable and I would stay there again!"
163,1913,"Aug 30 2006 	What went wrong with the Concierge?	My husband and I decided to splurge and stay at the SoHo Grand, largely to try a &quot;real&quot; neighborhood in NYC. That part of the plan worked out well, and we enjoyed a good choice of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. As for the amenities, the room and bathroom were clean, and as small as you'd expect in most NY hotels- nothing special for the price, and not as attractive as the website photos would suggest. Also as you'd expect, noise from the street, especially on Saturday night when the lobby bar is hopping, is par for the course. We kept the ac unit on to help drown it out. Upon check in, the staff greeted us warmly, and provided cool washcloths and champagne to refresh us. We were given a room on the 5th floor and were readily accommodated when we asked to be moved higher (due to the noise factor). The bellman, doormen, and bar staff were all pleasant. If this was the sum of our experience, we would probably tell people wanting to stay in SoHo that this place was fine, but that we would try one of the other main hotels in the area (Tribeca Grand or 60 Thompson) before returning.Sadly, that was not the sum total of our experience. A hotel of this class typically provides a first class concierge service. That was not the case for us, and we urge guests to double check any reservation they make directly with the venue. We spoke with one concierge on Thursday, the day before our arrival, who arranged tickets for us to see Oscar Peterson at Birdland on Sunday night. For non-jazz fans, Oscar is a huge name, sure to sell out each of his rare performances. The concierge was very helpful through a series of calls as we made the booking. He took our credit card number to finalize the reservation, then called me back to confirm it had been done. He also made a second reservation at The Blue Note for Friday evening, which he said could be cancelled. When we arrived on Friday, we spoke with a different concierge, again very helpful. We asked him to cancel the Blue Note reservation and to suggest and book a restaurant instead. When we came downstairs that evening and asked for directions to the restaurant, a third concierge told us we had reservations at the Blue Note, and none for dinner. While we waited, she cancelled the Blue Note and called the restaurant, which fortunately had room for us. Concerned about the mix up, we asked her to re-confirm our booking at Birdland. She checked and said it was all arranged. At the restaurant, we received a dessert compliments of the SoHo Grand.When we arrived at Birdland on Sunday, we found that there was no reservation under our name, the SoHo Grand, or any of the concierge's names, and no reservations were available. We called the hotel and asked to speak with the manager, who passed us on to yet another concierge who kept us on hold while trying to figure out what happened. We finally hung up after about 10 minutes. When we got back to the room, there was an apology note, strawberries and wine, but no explanation as to what happened or why, no adjustment to the bill, and no further comment when we checked out the next morning. In the end, everything worked out for us. We were not charged for the Blue Note. We had a great meal at the recommended restaurant. We got to see Oscar thanks to a compassionate Birdland hostess. Given the concierge service we experienced at the SoHo Grand, we felt very lucky indeed."
164,1913,"Aug 29 2006 	Grand Hotel Great Concierge	I suprised my husband with a weekend package to celebrate his promotion. The lobby/bar area really rocks! Fab industrial/sleek decor! Pckg. included a voucher for drinks/appetizer at the bar. Great cocktails (they even match the ice with the cocktail - crushed or cubes)! we returned after dinner for a nitecap and the bar was really buzzing. Concierge secured us reservations for dinner and brunch the next day. Frette bathrobe (curiosly, only one) and linens were dreamy. Clean retro-inspired tiled bathroom (white subway and honeycomb tiles). Other nice touches, including A note congratulating my husband on his promotion, were appreciated."
165,1913,"Aug 26 2006	Mother-daughter trip	I took my teenage daughter to NYC for an &quot;end of the summer&quot; mother- daughter trip, and the Soho Grand was the perfect hotel. Not only is the staff professional and helpful, but the neighborhood was hip and active! We could have stayed &quot;uptown&quot; in a stuffy hotel......but really enjoyed the neighborhood, and spent very little time in the room! Which, by the way, was similar to an apt. that I had rented 20 years earlier in the village,but much more luxurious!My daughter was able to meet friends in the &quot;garden&quot;, and hang out in the lounge, instead of &quot;going out&quot;. We will definetly come back to the Soho Grand!"
166,1913,"Aug 21 2006	A wonderful hotel for a weekend getaway	My husband and I had the opportunity to celebrate our anniversay this past weekend with the Soho Grand's special Anniversary Package. We stayed only one night...but the experience was really great...thanks to the wonderful amenities provided by the hotel. Besides encountering a supremely gracious staff, we were bowled over by the bottle of Veuve Cliquot which was waiting for us in our room...along with the chocolate covered strawberries and rose petals at our bedside. What a nice way to start our stay! The hotel itself is beautiful...the epitomy of Soho chic...and the location can't be beat...if Soho is your favorite NY neighborhood...as it is mine. Alas...Soho has been overrun by way too many people during the day...but the hotel is a welcome respite from the hordes on the streets. Yes...the room was beautiful and comfortable...though too small...but isn't that the case with all chic NY boutique hotels? The full complimentary American breakfast was great All in all...a great hotel experience at a really fantastic price. It isn't often that you spend time in a hotel without thinking you are paying way too much money for your stay. As a seasoned business traveler, I would say that The Soho Grand ranks at the top of my hotel experiences."
167,1913,"Aug 12 2006 	The Grand IS Grand	We have stayed at The Parker and a few Ws throughout Manhatten...From the second we gave our car to the valet at the Soho Grand, we knew it was going to be good. Everyone was very professional and friendly. They went out of their way to make sure our room was as requested.When we wanted to take the subway instead of cabs during rush hour, the concierge made sure we knew the exact trains and stops we needed. We see no reason to stay elsewhere in the future."
168,1913,"Aug 9 2006 	Great hip hotel!	The Soho Grand provides great guest service! We were very impressed with it's location and unique amenities. The bed was absolutely dreamy and there were actual opening windows including one in the bathroom! We booked the 'Seduction in Soho' package. The champagne at check-in was fantastic, however the shopping discounts were not great and were available at stores that we had no interest in. All the other details of the package are true to the Internet advertisement and wonderful. I would book at the hotel Web site directly, in addition, be sure to sign up as a Grand Guest. I believe you have to sign up seperately if you plan to stay at it's sister hotel - Tribeca Grand.We will definitely stay there again!"
169,1913,"Aug 8 2006 	Grand Indeed	I recently stayed in Manhattan for four days on business. I am from there originally and am very picky about hotels. The neighborhood itself is fantastic - you can walk to everything and there are tons of restaurants, bars and shops nearby. The hotel itself is brilliant. You walk into a somewhat subdued lobby where only the concierge desk and elevators are located. The main lobby/bar/restaurant are technically on the 2nd floor so you are able to bypass all of the hubbub by slipping up to your room from the main floor elevators. The rooms are small (but what rooms aren't in NYC) but well-placed furnishings and comfortable ammenities abound. The flat-screen tvs with DVD players are a huge plus. The bathrooms are really a decent size, as is the closet (rare in NYC). The bed is extremely comfortable and most rooms have great views. I stayed on the 8th floor and had a lovely south-facing view. It's nice not to be facing an air shaft!I ate at the restaurant/bar and visited &quot;The Yard.&quot; All were highly enjoyable. The staff were also very friendly and accommodating. For the location, ammenities and service, I can't say enough great things about this hotel. I will definitely be back."
170,1913,Aug 7 2006	Loved the stay. Great room friendly staff.	Lovely stay. Nice check-in experience (towels &amp; champagne). Room was good size (was expecting a smaller room which is typical for boutique hotels). Staff very friendly. Compared to other hotels (eg 60 Thompson) the rates were preferable.
171,1913,"Aug 6 2006	Fun in Soho	What's not to like about checking in and being rewarded with a chilled Champagne cocktail right at the desk? A pet goldfish in the room kept me company for the brief time I was awake and not roaming about the area. The Concierge gave great recommendations for casual lunch and breakfast in Soho. The room was much roomier than what I recall from my last visit (or maybe my expectations of New York hotel room sizes have gotten smaller), the linens were nice, and the staff was very friendly. I love the Soho Grand and they acted like they loved me, too. It was a pleasure to stay there and I'd happily go back again."
172,1913,Aug 4 2006	Very hip hotel	We stayed at the Soho Grand for a long weekend under the Seduction in Soho package - excellent value. This was booked on the hotel's web site - I could not find cheaper rates anywhere else.Our room was excellent and decor was what you would expect at a boutique hotel - trendy.All the staff were friendly and helpful - they even arranged for a limo to collect us from the airport. Contacting us by email before the trip to check if we have any special requests was a nice touch.We most certainly recommend the Soho Grand.
173,1913,"Aug 2 2006 	What a cracking view	went to stay at the Soho Grand on the advice of a friend of mine, and boy was i pleased i did, what a great hotel, nice staff, easy to navigate the whole of manhattan from, lovely to walk around soho and greenwich. the hotel gave us a room looking uptown directly at the empire state building and the Chrysler building, i loved it, loved new york more than i thought i would, i think it was because of the hotel............recommend it to anyone...."
174,1913,"Jul 31 2006 	Great NYC hotel	Great service, they really go out of their way to accomodate guests. Smallish rooms, but typical for the NYC. The hotel is &quot;hip&quot;, but not too hip that they forget how to treat their guests. The perks were a welcome treat, and really good as a &quot;Grand Guest&quot;. I will certainly stay at the Soho Grand on my next visit to New York. Overall, a wonderful NYC hotel!"
175,1913,"Jul 31 2006	Don't believe the good reviews - STAY ANYWHERE BUT HERE	My wife ordered the &quot;Producers VIP weekend getaway&quot; which was heavily promoted by them. According to the package we were supposed to get tickets to the producers broadway show and stay at the Grand King room.In realty they made a mockery of us. Called us up after we arrived in NY to let us know that the tickets were sold out (so much for the &quot;VIP&quot;) and that we could go to another available show (which was complete garbage). When we explained that the only reason we came was for this show and asked that they refund our money (as per the terms of their offer) they refused.They ruined our weekend, cost us money, and now we have to deal with doing a chargeback to get our money. Several calls to the hotel showed us that there is 0 customer service there. Everyone is dodging bullets and hangs up to phone when there are problems. STAY AWAY FOR YOUR SAKE!"
176,1913,"Jul 26 2006	THe SoHo Grand is the best place to stay in NYC	Since January of this year I have stayed at the SoHo Grand 5 times and everytime has been incredible. I have traveled to NYC many years and have stayed at many different hotels, mainly in mid-town but I will never stay anywhere else from now on. The service is excellent in every area of the hotel. The doormen are so friendly ( even remembering you from previous stays), the front desk is extremely professional yet personal. The rooms are so beautiful and comfortable. The view is incredible. THe concieres are absolutely the very best. Every restaurant they have recommended has been excellent, ones that I go back to again. If you need show tickets, they can get them. They really help with anything you need. I have traveled extensively and I can truly say that this is my favorite hotel. I will not stay anywhere else in NYC and tell all my friends about it. The SoHO Grand knows what customer service is all about and everyone of their employees buys into it. You can tell when a place is managed well by the pride that their employees display and every employee in that hotel is proud of their job and works very hard to make every aspect of your stay perfect."
177,1913,"Jul 26 2006 	SoHo Grand -City chic	We have stayed at the SoHo for our anniversary for the past four years. This year we booked the Anniversary weekend package which was a great deal- champagne, chocolate dipped strawberries, free breakfast, rose petals- all at a better price than a regular weekend reservation. The staff here is always courteous, the rooms small but adequate, and the bar/lounge area is one of the nicest I have seen in the city. It is a contemporary styled oasis in the most exciting section of New York- great restaurants and unbeatable shopping"
178,1913,"Jul 25 2006 	Great Location and Friendly Staff	Hotel offers excellent location for exploring the SoHo, Tribeca, Greenwich Village neighborhoods. All the staff I interacted with were friendly and helpful--the doormen always gave a warm hello, Carrie the concierge recommended wonderful day spas, the front desk attendant kindly allowed me an early check in. Internet access available free in the Business Center. As a member of the Grand Guest program I received free continental breakfast delivered to my room each morning and a complimentary snack my first evening. There is a also a handy machine on each floor with complimentary hot beverages. In a town like New York, the extra value offered at this hotel is a definite plus. I also booked the Birthday package, though it was not my birthday, and received yummy cupcakes, a wonderful giftset of shampoo and conditioner and a compilation CD. I booked a King Deluxe room. Not exactly sure what made it a Deluxe room, however I have no complains. The bed was amazingly comfortable which is the most important thing to me. The two day spas I visited were Euphoria in Tribeca and Banyon Citispa on W. Broadway. I highly recommend both. On West Broadway just up the street from the hotel check out Satellite Paris for amazing jewelry and relatively affordable prices. It's the company's only store in the US. Restaurants I visited on this trip were Nobu in Tribecca for lunch. Got there at 11:45 when it opened and the place was mobbed already, the Risotteria in Greenwich Village which besides offering an awesome selection of risotto, pizza &amp; panni, specializes in gluten-free dishes, and Salt on MacDougal which was also wonderful. All in all, a great weekend, can't wait to go back!"
179,1913,"Jul 24 2006 	Not Good  Stay Somewhere Else.	Hello,Actually no I did not have a good stay and checked out the next morning. Here is a list of all the things that went wrong:1.The bathroom on the lobby floor was in such a bad state that I didnt go to the bathroom. I brought it to the attention of the brunette at the front desk and she didnt seem to care. 2.My room smelt a little moldy.3.The bathroom in the room definitely needs updating: tub, sink, and shower dated back at least 20 years. 4.The room was very small even for NY standards. 5.I booked three rooms for our company meeting and they charged all three rooms to one of our employees for the entire expected trip of 4 days. Poor guy couldnt use his CC. 6.One of our employees came in 2 days early and since I booked the rooms they wouldnt let him check in. I had put in the notes area that this room was for him, but they failed to acknowledge that. He had to track me down between flight and get me to call the hotel. 7.The front desk staff is not helpful at all in any way shape or form. 8.On the day we checkout Jessica Simpson was leaving the hotel and I gave my baggage tickets to a bellman and he lost them and it took me over an hour to get my bags back. Cant imagine what Jessica Simpson sees in that hotel9.The hotel isnt located in a very nice area of soho, you have to walk a few blocks away to get to the nicer shopping area of Soho. 10.Gee my list can go on and on but Ill stop here.Thanks, Camie"
180,1913,"Jul 17 2006	the Soho Grand is fabulous!	We spent one night there for a 50th birthday celebration in NYC. The room was spacious, and confortable with a large window overlooking Soho. Amenities were great, flat screen TV, DVD &amp; BOSE CD/Alarm clock, outside garden &amp; lounge area. The staff was professional and attentive to your needs. The birthday celebration package included champagne at check-in, early check-in and late departure, complimentary drinks and appetizers in the lounge, a music CD and special gift in the room, all for the same price as the regular room. A must stay, we will definitely go back again."
181,1913,"Jul 17 2006	Soho Grand...great spot will return	Hotel was easliy accessible and had a friendly staff to assist from the minute you arrived. Hotel is decorated in a very industrial look, very cool. Room was clean and comfortable. easy walk to little italy, greenwich village and china town."
182,1913,"Jul 12 2006 	Great place	Upon arrival, the doorman was very helpful and friendly. In fact, all the people employed there were courteous, knowledgable and professional. The decor is very trendy and attractive. The public areas of the hotel kinda reminded me of being in the middle of a stage or movie set. Visitors tended to be young, urban and stylish. Very eclectic and interesting atmosphere. I would definitely stay there again on future visits."
183,1913,"Jul 11 2006	never again!	j haven't had a stay this unpleasant in a long time! i am a demanding customer, but these guys are just amateurs! this is gonna be a very short review because i have no words to describe all the wrong things in this hotel. the service is just horrible! everything from laundry to guest relations is just not functioning. never going to stay here again"
184,1913,"Jul 11 2006	Expensive Dirty Bathrooms	We stayed one night at the SoHo Grand. The area is amazing and perfect for those restaurant and shopping savvy guests. However, the rooms at the hotel were not quite as pleasurable. The bathrooms were modest and also very dirty with hair and soap remnants from the previous guests. The shampoo, conditioner and body lotion samples were only half filled which gave the appearance that they were reusing those that were left by previous guests. The staff was polite but not overly friendly. Would choose another hotel in the SoHo location but wouldn't stay at the Grand again."
185,1913,"Jul 10 2006	A great hotel	The best hotel in the world to travel with your dog. The bar/lounge is the best in the city,and you may sit there with your dog too. And the doormen are marvelous."
186,1913,"Jul 10 2006	Soho Grand is indeed Grand	This was not our first stay at the Soho Grand, but it was among the best. We took adventage of the 'Anniversary' special, and it was just fabulous. From the moment we approached the front desk to check in, where we were offered a glass of champagne, the staff was uniformly friendly and professional. New York in July can be a bit steamy, and a refreshing cold towel was offered at check in as well. Our impeccably clean room was adequate in size, perhaps a bit smallish, but fine for two. There was a bottle of Veuve Cliquot champagne on ice, chocolate covered strawberries, a candle, and a long stemmed rose waiting for us in the room, a perfect complement to our romantic weekend. The king size bed had some of the finest linens I have ever seen, soft, smooth, and ultra luxurious. The towels and bathrobes were Frette, ditto the soft and luxurious. When I had occassion to call the front, they greeted me by name, and there was a personalized note from the General Manager on the table in the room; they really try to make you feel like an valued client, and it is a nice change from most other hotels! The room also featured a large screen flat-panel TV, a Bose CD player (with a small but hip CD collection to choose from), and high-end soaps and shampoo. Location is great, walk to shops, galleries, and some of the best restaurants in the world. The package also includes a full American breakfast in bed..."
187,1913,"Jul 6 2006	Soho was impeccable	My stay this time was four nights and 5 days. The experience was magnificent!From the Doormen who took me in and escorted me out, to the housekeeping dept that I never once saw during my stay but my room was spotless every day, to the service in the bar and restaurant, it was all fit for a Queen!!Even my last day when I went to eat my last meal which I wanted to have breakfast, it was past the time and into lunch. The host saw my disapointment and accomodated me with a breakfast menu, this is just to mention one little accomodation out of many I received during my stay.I want to thank all of you for making my trip to NY so enjoyable!"
188,1913,Jul 6 2006	Outstanding	I stayed at the Soho Grand Hotel in NYC from July 2nd through July 4th 2006 and it was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. The hotel was immaculate from the lobby to the lounge to the guest rooms. Service was incredible and catered to any needs. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again.
189,1913,"Jul 5 2006	A Grand stay in Soho	Just spent another night at the Soho Grand and have had several stays of 2 or 3 nights since 2001. This is a great hotel, with great service in a great location. The rooms are fairly small, as most NYC hotels are, but the space is utilized well so they do not seem claustrophobic like rooms at The Hudson, Paramount and countless others. It pays to join their grand guest program on their website as you get great rates (especially at their slower times) and perks like free bottle water, fruit and cheese on your arrival.There is plenty to do in this great neighborhood with everything in walking distance (unless of course you are heading to broadway!)."
190,1913,"Jul 5 2006	Service some of the best I've had...anywhere	Having already stayed at a couple ofl other New York properties and eaten at various high quality restaurants, I assumed that nonchalent service was just something you'd have to put up with in New York. However, at the Soho Grand I was greeted warmly, provided an excellent room with a view of the New York skyline and spoken to in a friendly courteous manner by every member of staff I encountered. A few drinks in the hotel bar were an enjoyable way to end the evening. Having stayed at 5 star hotels in other cities around the world, I can honestly say that this is up there service-wise with the others. Something I would not have anticipated after my other New York hotel experiences. And the rooms are pretty good too.By the way, I later stayed at the Westin Times Square. I would have stayed an additional night at Soho Grand, but the deadline for cancelling my Westin reservation was up. Although the Westin is a nice hotel facilities wise, the service was not. The check in guy couldn't find my reservation, then condecendingly asked me if I had the right hotel. I quoted my Starpoints number and it came up - no apology. No help with my bags, and when waiting for an elevator to my room with my bags, a porter with a trolley full of other bags moved quickly to make sure he got in the elevator before me (thereby filling it up) so I had to wait for the next car. Similar lack of service quality was experienced at check out and attempts to get a taxi. The only exception being the male concierge who was very helpful in advice on airport transport (hire cars etc)."
191,1913,Jul 3 2006	Excellent!	Excellent hotel. Very service oriented. Even had a goldfish in the room for my husband with a note from me as I requested. Beats any hotel we've stayed at in NYC. Would absolutely recommend and stay there again!
192,1913,"Jun 28 2006	SoHo Grand is one of our favorites in NY	SoHo Grand is top notch. As native New Yorkers who now live elsewhere, we travel to NYC frequently for family obligations. We always stay at SoHo Grand. Service is wonderful, rooms are nice size, location is terrific!! Great vibe to it as well. Highly recommended!!"
193,1913,"Jun 28 2006	First Class Service!	To stay at the Soho Grand is to be treated like royalty. The staff is attentive, polite and accomodating in every way. Any time I called for something it was delivered within minutes and everyone is courteous and helpful.The decor is grand (as the name suggests) and the rooms are cozy with Bose stereo alarm CD radios and flat screen TVs. They even have a DVD/CD player with a selection of CDs you can try out and purchase. You can borrow a bike to ride, an iPod to listen to, and even have a goldfish if you get lonely (all inlcuded in the room price)!As they welcome pets, I was able to bring my dog into the lobby when I checked in and out, I could order dog food and treats, even a bed if I needed one, and they had water for him outside the hotel in the &quot;dog bar&quot;. Highly recommended."
194,1913,"Jun 25 2006	SoHo Grand Perfection	I wish my stay at the SoHo Grand could've been longer. The hotel is very unique and very hip. The interior is like nothing I had ever seen before. Everything about my room was perfect - bed, size, bathroom and comfort. The concierge knew a lot of NYC and was able to give me some great suggestions for restaurants and shops. The restaurant/bar had great food and the DJ played a great selection of music - Ramones, Blondie, techno, dance. And right out my front door were all the great shops of SoHo and the Village. I will never stay anywhere else when I visit NYC."
195,1913,"Jun 16 2006	Fabulous stay at the Soho Grand	We booked a package deal through the Soho Grand site about one week before we were scheduled to be in New York. The package deal was aobut the cost of a basic room, but with some extras-- including a room upgrade to a corner King (we had an amazing view of the Hudson on one side and to the south/east on the other), breakfast each morning, and a late check-in and out. There were flowers in our room (and chocolates), and some fun bath confetti (it was a &quot;romantic&quot; package theme). The bed, including the linens and the pillows, was pure luxury. I have never stayed at a hotel where the bed was more comfortable than my own. The bathroom and room size, while not huge, were both spacious for NYC standards and well-designed. The breakfast each morning was perfect, with fabulous coffee, delicious pastries, eggs, and fresh fruit flecked with bits of fresh mint. That and the NYT outside the door (even on Sunday) was the best way to start our day. It was so much so that we didn't leave the room until the early afternoon.The staff were extremely nice and friendly, without being intrusive. The public spaces of the hotel were lovely and uncluttered, and we especially enjoyed all the people who brought their pets. It's obviously a very pet-friendly hotel.The location is spectacular-- lots of do and see in the immediate neighborhood, and just a few blocks away from several different subway stations. We loved the Soho Grand -- we don't routinely spend that much on a hotel when we stay in the city, but it was worth every penny."
196,1913,"Jun 12 2006	Service With Style!	I am a woman with the most complicated taste... and I was pleased with the Soho Grand's style and amenities. The rooms are terribly small, but the service was spectacular, the food (especially the Mac &amp; Cheese) fantastic, and the toiletries unparalled (So good, in fact, I walked for an hour to find the tiny shop that makes them... so that I could spend $160.00 on a bottle of lotion). Although this hotel didn't have the giant gym, the oppulent spa... the staff made it feel as though any wish was thier demand. I would recommed this hotel to my most high maintenance friends..."
197,1913,"Jun 12 2006	The Soho Grand is grand!	I used to live in NYC, but since relocating to the eastern end of Long Island, my husband and I still like to spend the occasional weekend in Manhattan. This has become somewhat challenging since the birth of our son, who is now almost a year old. Most hotels, as you know, will take every opportunity to charge you for anything, and we've become accustomed to this, especially when we need a crib in the room (this averages about $40 per stay, in our experience). I am delighted to report that not only does the Soho Grand have a complimentary program for people with babies, which includes a crib and baby toiletries, everything else was wonderful as well. We joined the Grand Guest program, which gives you 10% off your room and a welcome ammenity. We choose the fruit and cheese basket, which was a lovely and ample treat. We also booked the Seduction in Soho package (there are many other packages available), which included 2 cocktails (at $12-18 a cocktail, this was quite a nice surprise), late checkout, early check-in, chocolates, glasses of champagne, and a full American breakfast for two. Freebies are often subpar, but not here. Our breakfast was delicious - the eggs were fluffy and the scones buttery. The staff were accomodating without being fawning, and were very helpful from the get-go. A doorman pointed out a free parking spot on the block, though he could've easily hawked the hotel's $45 parking. Our baby spit up on the sheets in the middle of the night, and someone cheerfully came and changed the sheets for us. When I didn't have change for a room service tip, the server was very gracious and said that these things happen and told me not to worry about it. Of course, that made me want to hunt him down and tip him even more once I got change, which we did! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel and wholeheartedly recommend it. It's in a great location, the rooms are a decent size, and the perks are endless. It's our official hotel in the city now - can't think of higher praise than that!"
198,1913,"Jun 8 2006	a very mixed experience at the Soho Grand	The greatest assets of this hotel are its location and its style. I had had a mixed experience on a previous stay but because I needed to stay in the area again, I decided to give the Soho Grand another try. Upon arrival I had prompt, friendly service at the front desk. It then took over 45 minutes of waiting and a phone call on my part to get my luggage brought up.On the positive side, my room was very clean, well soundproofed, and offered a stunning view of Manhattan. Housekeeping service was good and responsive to my needs.On a less positive note, some of the furnishings are in poor, shabby condition and there is clearly no thorough checking of rooms prior to their occupancy. On a previous stay I had a defective TV set. This time, the TV set was fine but the floor lamp did not work, as its light switch was very visibly broken. It was replaced to my satisfaction.The in-room telephone was also defective. Every single attempt to call either guest services or room service would result in interrupted connections -- that is, when I managed to get a dial tone. I requested that my in-room phone be checked and replaced if need be. I don't know whether it was. If so, the second phone also had problems. My last call, to request luggage pick-up as I was checking out, was cut off (as usual). On my second try, the staff member at the front desk told me that the line was not functioning well that morning. Since it had not functioned well for the past six days, I was sadly not surprised.By the way, that request to have my luggage picked up was not followed through. I had to call yet again twenty minutes later, at a time where the hotel did not appear to be particularly swamped with arriving or departing guests.The room service staff was prompt and courteous. However, not once in six mornings did the room service tray include a plate (never mind two) for us to eat, say, the pastries from the continental breakfast. I was disappointed by the room service menu. I found it, like the hotel itself, heavy on concept and light on satisfaction. The good-quality deli across the street from the hotel became, by default, my daily source for more appealing options.The doormen were helpful, friendly, professional. But they didn't make up for the various annoyances that popped up during the stay and that pointed to a lack of true attention to detail. For this very steep price, a stylish hotel should not neglect basic good service to the degree that the Soho Grand does."
199,1913,Jun 8 2006	Polite efficient helpful	Pleasant room with a nice view Uptown. Everyone I dealt with was polite without being too formal and very helpful. Managed to get me a table at the Gramercy Tavern on very short notice. I'll go back.PH
200,1913,"Jun 5 2006	Fabulous hotel the epitome of NYC	I arrived very late after a delayed flight from London for my stay at the Soho Grand Hotel and everyone from the doorman to the reception was very friendly. The bar is open late with a funky laid back yet sophisticated atmosphere. Great location, went for a morning run along the river and central to numerous places to eat and shop. Good size rooms as well. I would recommend.KimmberlyLondon, England"
201,1913,Jun 4 2006	great location	We love staying here. This was our forth visit. The location is great near shopping and restaurants and we always get good service. We like the modern decor.
202,1913,"Jun 4 2006	Loved every thing about it !!!	We are a 39 and 42 year old couple who just came back from 3 nights at the Soho and absolutely LOVED IT!!! First of all it is important to take everything into perspective. We are talking about New York City. Rooms are expensive and small, and a view is usually non-existant. So, for me personally, what makes a good hotel is the rooms, comfortable beds and living space, friendly staff, great location, and good amenities. The Soho Grand has all those things.The rooms are average small but definately comfortable. The way the furnishings are placed definately makes the room appear and feel larger than it is. Beds were extremely comfortable with down pillows and fluffy duvets, plasma TV;'s are a nice touch, bathroom was also small but very well laid out. The rooms felt new and fresh to me. Good airconditioning and the window also opened if you prefered. Only had a pedestal sink but there was also a shelf and table in the bathroom to allow you to lay out your things comfortably while you get ready. Showers were marvelous - great pressure and nice and hot. Tons of towels. Yes it is true that there isn't a coffee maker in your room (although the in-room bar is very nicely stocked with a nice assortment of drinks and goodies) but there is a marvelous machine on every floor that made good coffee, hot chocolate, water for tea, etc. I was very comfortable strolling over in my PJ's or robe - never saw anyone anyways (regadless of where you room is, couldn't be more than 30 steps or less). Complimentary continental breakfast was a nice touch each morning - fantastic pastries and coissants. Hotel amenities were perfect for us. Fantastic lounge and restaurant. Very cool and chic - a bit on the expensive side, but the quality is good.Service was fantastic - from the front desk, to the conscierge, to the cleaning staff (turndown service was very nice also), to room service....everything was quick and everyone was extremely polite.The location was superb!!!! We had had enough of uptown and midtown, so this time we decided to stay in soho so we could spend our limited time in the great neighbourhoods of soho, grenwich, etc. This hotel is in the BEST location!!!! Right on West Broadway. Within 50 steps you have amazing restaurants and shops at your disposal. Oh yeah, forgot to mention - taxi fares from Laguardia airport to hotel were also a nice surprise. To the hotel was only $24.00 and from hotel back to airport was $33.00 (we got stuck in traffic) - much less than the other fares that I have been reading. Taxi fares uptown to Rockefeller Centre/Saks/Lord and Taylor/5th Avenue Shopping approximately $10.00.We definately recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a boutique style experience in a hip, cool and relaxed area of soho and greenwich area. We definately would and are going to come back again. In fact we wouldn't stay anywhere else anymore.Go and enjoy!"
203,1913,"Jun 3 2006	Soho Grand is all around excellent!	We go to NYC several times throughout the year..whenever we stay overnight we stay at the SOHO grand. The grand is sheek &amp; sophisticated...From the pretty staff,l to the room ,to all the added touches they offer....my favorite is the fish! ( if you are not bringing your own pet- which is allowed, they offer to supply you w/ a &quot;pet goldfish&quot; to keep you company during your stay- he is generally in your room upon arrival)....the location is great for walking ...lots of shopping, restaurants, &amp; galleries-perfect for those artsie types....into town...a $20(ish) cab ride..the price is not cheap, but they do sometimes offer fun packages &amp; off peak season it is definitley a good buy! As fussy as someone like myself is, I can't say anything bad- even if a mistake is made, ( hey we're all human!), their recovery is more than satisfactory! hope you to enjoy."
204,1913,"May 31 2006	Not so grand	For the price and reputation, the Soho Grand did not meet my expectations. I stayed here in May 2006 as part of a wedding party and was fairly disappointed with the service. The reception staff was stuffy and unaccomodating. Even though I called ahead one day before and that morning, I was unable to check in one minute before the offical 3:00pm check in. When I requested extra towels, I did not receive them for 2 hours when the room was made up. The room was small, typical for NY, and the bed was comfortable. While the hotel was clean and modern and the location was great, I felt that the hotel was overly pretentious and ordinary for it's service level and price."
205,1913,"May 30 2006	Enjoyed staying at the SoHo Grand Hotel in NYC	Although I only stayed overnight at the SoHo Grand Hotel my experience was above average. The bed and room was comfortable. Basics like coffee, tea, hot chocolate were compimentary, available at all hours of the day and night. Service was immediate. I met a friend there, coming from New Jersey. The hotel staff coordinated our arrival without any issues. All staff were polite, friendly and accomodating! The service had a very personal feeling."
206,1913,"May 30 2006	Excellent B-Day Package	I took my husband to NYC for a whirlwind tour, starting with our stay at the Soho Grand. Booked the B-day package (Cupcakes, champagne toast, free gift, early check-in/late check-out, etc.) Overall we were very happy and would certainly visit again. I must admit I was a bit nervous about my choice after reading Fodor's 2006 (old and tired decor) and some of the 1 star reviews on Trip Advisor, but we found nothing of the sort to be true.The staff was nothing but gratious. We had 1 snafu (No champagne toast as promised upon arrival - we had to ask twice, but very apologetic and friendly about the situation).The room was great - contemporary, view of uptown as requested, etc. Loved the cd selection for the Bose radio and the flat screen TV. B-Day cupcakes were the best I have ever had (And I am not a cake person).We loved the location of the hotel - minutes by foot to all the cool shops/restauarnts etc in SoHo. The Grand Bar was great - good drinks, great apps (didn't have a full dinner), and great music. It was a happening scene, but not a &quot;SCENE&quot;, so we felt very comfortable.We tend to be pretty picky (will never stay at another &quot;W Hotel&quot;)- and we both thought this hotel was great."
207,1913,"May 26 2006 	bad for a 5-star hotel	I had issue with my card keys every day and had to go down on a slow elevator to the reception all the time. Sometimes the hotel staff happened to be there and they helped me. (they were actually nice) But the reception was usually shorthanded and I had to wait for a while...it made me feel miserable at the end of the day, when i was looking for a relaxed bath!The room was not throughly cleaned, and in fact I found more than one grass particles on the floor, fortunately before I inujured myself. Amenities were not replenished until I leave a note to ask for.. (I tipped! fyi)Coffee maker is not in the room, while there was a big coffee machine outside along with ice maker. Many people went there in their bathrobe.. so did I..even though I once was taught not to go out of the room in such an attire :p Afterall it was a five-star hotel, so you can expect comfort to certain extent, but I thought I could expect more! (my rating is based on my expectation for the hotel of that grade, just let you know.)"
208,1913,"May 23 2006	Loved the Soho Grand	I love being spontaneous and the unexpected, hence I love visiting NY. I also like something to ground me. The Soho Grand is what I use for that. I always make sure I stay there."
209,1913,"May 16 2006	SoHo Grand Top Notch Service	Just returned from a weekend at the SoHo Grand. My second stay there and the service continues to be first rate. Each and every staff member we encountered was warm, friendly and helpful. The rooms are no larger than the average NYC hotel, but they are well appointed and what the rooms lack in size the hotel makes up for in amenities, service and location. Besides, what are you doing in your room when you can walk out the front door and enjoy SoHo?"
210,1913,"May 15 2006	loved the soho grand	we loved the area, great location in soho. the rooms are small but comfortable, great amenities. we were on the 14th floor. pretty quiet. we really enjoyed our stay. the architecture of the hotel is very cool.i would recommend this hotel"
211,1913,"May 8 2006	Soho Grand is GRAND!	We chose the Soho Grand because it is in an area we love, and because it welcomes our pet dogs with open arms and doggie treats. As an added bonus, the rooms are extremely comfortable, the service is impeccable, and they give very good discounts to their returning guests. I would highly recommend the Soho Grand for anyone visiting New York."
212,1913,"May 8 2006	Grand Hospitality	As a relocated native New Yorker, it was a delight to visit my home town and stay at the SoHo Grand. Every member of the staff from managers to housekeeping couldn't have been nicer. The atmosphere is one of downtown sophistication, the service is like being at a family estate."
213,1913,"May 7 2006 	our goldfish had great views	Dear Ian,We love the Soho Grand........thank you so much for your consideration.There were a few times we had to get new keycards because the ones we had failed. This meant a trek back down to reception. Luckily my wife and I were born with fortified bowels.Nevertheless, the only serious complaint was that we didn't recognise our goldfish after his water was changed.Thanks again,Paul &amp; Kai"
214,1913,"May 6 2006 	A great place to stay!	I liked this hotel so much that it is now at the top of my list of places to stay at in Manhattan. I was travelling for business and it was so refreshing to stay at a hotel that was not full of &quot;suits.&quot; Since it's located in Soho, the clientele is very young, hip, and artsy. The staff is very accomodating and efficient. My room had a terrific north view of the city and was very comfortable and cozy. It did not feel like a hotel room. Another plus of this hotel is that it allows pets. I highly recommend this as a place to stay."
215,1913,"May 4 2006 	Exceptional service	What they lack in space, they make up for in service. So, I have to be completely honest...I am torn because I travel A LOT for business and over the past two years have stayed everywhere from the Four Seasons and the Ritz to the Rivington in NYC alone. My room at the SoHo Grand was by far the smallest for the price of anywhere I have stayed in NYC. On the other hand, the service parallelled that of the best of them. I was even treated by the hotel General Manager to amazingly delicious cupcakes and a note on my birthday! Everyone was super friendly and the concierge was quite helpful. The food at the hotel was excellent as was the atmosphere. The hotel is located in a great location--in walking distance to a multitude of trend-setting bars, restaurants and shopping. As far as being pet friendly is concerned, my dog Mork had an amazing experience. They sent up a comfy pet bed and bowls upon arrival. He was in heaven. The live goldfish in the room was a fun added touch. They have complimentary coffee, hot cocoa and tea on every floor! Also, if you register with their Grand Guest program you receive complimentary yummy pastries, tea or coffee, and juice daily. Great for the business traveler, especially since their wifi worked seemlessly. I would definitely stay here again for the service and location but...in an ideal world, I would love to couple that with a more spacious, modern room. But remember...in NYC it is all about making choices...space is scarce in general so there is always a trade-off, whether it be neighborhood, service, or whathaveyou...In my opinion, SoHo Grand has excellent service in a fun and vibrant neighborhood. That works for me. And, remember...the room was small, but only compared to my standards, which might be a bit skewed, so definitely keep that in mind. Overall, I give them an &quot;A.&quot;"
216,1913,May 2 2006	Great Hotel	This is the 3rd time my husband and I have been &quot;Grand guests&quot; we have stayed at both the Tribeca and Soho Grand Hotels and have found them both to be very enjoyable. The rooms although small are luxurious with all the necessary amenities. The service is excellent with great attention to detail. Both the &quot;Seduction in Soho&quot; and &quot;Tryst in Tribeca&quot; packages include breakfast in bed. (Breakfast at Tribeca is better) I would highly recommend either of these hotels.
217,1913,"May 1 2006	Great Hotel in a Great Location- Very Impressed!	We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Soho Grand, and I was vey impressed. I just read a review this woman from Luxembourg posted, (a few down) and can only say our experience was the opposite: We found the hotel staff to be very courteous and helpful. They even offered us &quot;loaner&quot; umbrellas (nice big ones) as it was raining for part of our stay. Although we did not bring our dogs, we also love the fact that it is a very pet-friendly hotel.As mentioned by other reviewers, the hotel is in a great location- one of the best neighborhoods in New York, with lots of great dining options nearby. We were also pleasantly surprised with the room service. We ordered 2 late night snacks and one breakfast, and all arrived within 30 minutes and all were still hot and actually surprisingly good food for room service. The hotel lobby and bar area are also very nice. Our room was quite large by New York standards, but maybe we were jaded because last time we stayed in one of the tiny jail cells atthe Hudson hotel last stay. (we could touch 3 walls at the same time). The hotel also offers a nice business room, with access to several Mac and PC computers for free. I brought my computer to check email, but did not need it- you can definitely leave them at home.Overall it was a great stay!"
218,1913,"May 1 2006	one word: HORRIBLE	I stayed 2 nights at USD 500 a night, the shower didnt work properly, the room was small and extremely ordinary. Sent out shirts to be ironed same day but they messed up so I got it back 2 hours too late AND they charged it. Trust me, I travel a lot and everywhere and this was one of the worst experiences ever."
219,1913,"Apr 30 2006	Soho Grand revisited	My husband and I stayed at the Soho Grand April 21-25, 2006. This was our 3rd. stay in the past 2 yrs., mainly because of the fantastic location. In the past I would have rated it as okay, but with some problems. This last visit was a pleasant surprise with marked improvements!From the moment we arrived to the very time that we departed the service was attentive and detailed. I believe that we had contact with every department of the hotel. The professional and courteous manner of each staff member, from the young woman at the front desk to the maid service, room service, concierge and doormen is to be commended. This reminded me of previous stays at some of the great service hotels worldwide.Our room, while small in U.S. standards, was newly refurbished. Great bed and great linens! Basket of fruit, turndown service were nice touches.Needless to say, we were very happy with our stay and plan on staying again next time."
220,1913,"Apr 26 2006	A great stay at the Soho Grand - Much better than we expected	Having read some of the reviews we were a little worried but we ended up having a lovely time at the Soho Grand. From check-in to check-out we found most of the staff to be polite, friendly and helpful. The possible exception to this may be some of the doormen and the concierge who did the basics of their jobs and thats it (they weren't rude but were just not very forthcoming but perhaps that is just New York!). We had booked the Seduction in Soho package for my 40th birthday and stayed 4 nights over the Easter weekend. We were given a nice room (more spacious than we expected) with views of the Empire State). The package included champagne on arrival, breakfast in the room everyday and drinks at the bar (we had an issue regarding this last bit - i.e. what was promised at booking and what was given on arrival but this was swiftly and pleasantly resolved to our satisfaction by Sonya at the front desk). In fact Sonya went as far as sending sparkling wine and chocolates to our room to make our stay even more enjoyable. A lovely thought!We loved the location - convenient for subways, restaurants, bars, shopping etc. The bar at the Soho Grand is fun and the standard of the food good."
221,1913,"Apr 25 2006 	Stay here	Beautiful, hip, urbane, exciting. Perfect location. Great bar. Spacious rooms (for NYC) at a reasonable price. Attentive and knowledgable staff."
222,1913,"Apr 24 2006	A place to avoid	Arrogant and incompetent staff  small and noisy rooms. Worth $250/night.Over the last 20 years, I stayed at various hotels in NY city, ranging from $200 to $700 a night. My stay at Soho Grand has definitely been my worst experience. It is notably due to the behavior of its staff : arrogant, unpleasant, unhelpful, and with an attitude.  Front desk, just like room service, is badly understaffed. As we were checking in around 2:00 PM, the front desk lady advised us to wait a full hour, because our rooms were not ready, since official check in time was at 3:00 PM. She did not even bother calling the cleaning lady to if she could be speed up a bit so we dont have to wait another full hour after an 8-hour plane trip from Europe. Even Motel 6 does it! Eventually, we left our luggage at the hotel and came back around 6:00. We were then given rooms (901 &amp; 1101  numbers to avoid), from which, surprisingly enough, we could see and be seen by an adjacent corner room! Thus, we had to close the curtain of our single window room for the whole stay to retain a little intimacy. We then asked to change of room, but were told that the hotel was fully booked  of course;  The room was ordinary, extremely small, noisy, the furniture cheap; the bathroom chronically undersupplied with toilet paper and tissues, insufficient water pressure, and not very clean. The floor lamp was broken when we came in, just like the curtain (we asked both to be fixed), and only a few hangers were left in the closet;  In the morning, we decided to order a breakfast. They told us we had to wait for an hour. We said that it would be too late. They replied that they would then cancel our order! Fabulous! The evening, we asked it to be delivered the next day between 8:30 and 8:45. It arrived at 9:20! without an excuse, just a missing crescent we had to order back through a very unpleasant room service lady. Then, prices were cheaper when you made your order the day before, and this for the same low quality food (the coffee was more of a tasteless brown water liquid than anything else). If you do not know what quality and service mean, do not pretend you do;  One evening, we had a drink at the bar, they brought 2 cold drinks  one of them being a fake freshly squeezed orange juice, and we had to wait another 10 minutes to see the warm drinks coming;  As you were coming forward to the staff, it seems that you were more of an annoyance to them. It seems that they had to attend to higher tasks than serving you. What they are indeed paid for. If you were not leaving a tip for storing your luggage, two of them would stop to reply to you!;  The climax of this journey came when I tried to take a picture of the totally empty lobby on the ground level, as I was waiting for my friends. A woman showed up and said they had a no photo policy. I saw tourists taking pictures for days, the concierge never said a word, but this arrogant woman decided I could not (was it because I was carrying an expensive camera around my neck ?!). Not only was she looking at me with superiority - although I suspect she could not really afford to spend the $1800 we left there over a few days, but she asked a security guard to repeat the message to me!!! Absolutely unheard of!!! In fact, I could only advise them to have a no photo policy for the rooms but not the lobby."
223,1913,"Apr 23 2006	great stay	Had a nice stay at the Soho Grand. The rooms are a bit small, and they only have king beds. (I was sharing with a girlfriend, and we would have preferred two beds). Our bathroom needed updating. The bar is great fun, and very relaxed. Location is great. Concierge was helpful. This was my second stay there, and I'd do it again. I only wish that the rooms were larger."
224,1913,"Apr 19 2006	Great Location impersonal service	Would highly recommend the Soho Grand for location, Soho is fantastic for bars, restaurants and shops. The hotel itself is lovely, the rooms are small but everything you need is in there. Only downfall is the lack of friendly service! The staff were stoney faced, no one offered to help take our bags to our room and we werent offered any kind of guide to the hotel (here is the bar/restaurant/gym etc ...)it was almost as if it was above them to help us. It is not cheap to stay here and i for one expect a much better service for my money."
225,1913,Apr 17 2006	Brilliant	Unbelievable view of Manhattan to the north. No issues with noise (was on the 14th floor). Friendly helpful staff. Couple of issues with lamps handled quickly. Super convenient location to Soho and subways. Will defnintely stay there again.
226,1913,"Apr 17 2006	. . . and they have Goldfish :)	Incredibly cute hotel, great amenities (including iPods, and loaner goldfish, should you need one).Great location with Concierge service that really knows the neighborhood and the city.Incredibly friendly and efficient staff.Loved it!!"
227,1913,"Apr 16 2006	Amazing hotel superb location impeccable service	I have stayed around the world in several 'Leading Hotels', and have been frequently impressed by their service. However, the SoHo Grand had been recommended to me in New York as being in an ideal area, and so I ditched Leading Hotels and opted for the SoHo Grand. I'm SO glad that I did. Upon arrival, our goldfish was already installed in it's bowl in our room, and seemed quite at ease. The room was beautiful, with extensive views over SoHo from our Corner King. The bed was sumptous, and the bathroom had an understated beauty. I suppose the overall style is reminiscent of a 1920's luxury hotel, but the hotel is far from stuck in the past. There are plasma screen TVs in each room, as well as iPods and BOSE sound docks upon request (free), as well as a BOSE CD player. There is a gourmet mini bar with such treats as gummi bears and organic chocolate, as well as the usual alcoholic treats. Over to the bathroom, and a selection of 'We Live Like This' products (shampoo / conditioner / shower gel / creams) are provided, as well as thick and lucious towels.The communal areas of the hotel are impeccably presented and are beautiful. There are large adornments of flowers around, which contrast well with an industrial style. The fitness and business centres are well equipped, and the bar is great with excellent service. The uniforms that the staff wear are very fashionable, with a very beautiful black dress for the front desk staff. The concierge were knowledgable and courteous, and provided some amazing dinner recommendations (Kittichai was a high-end Thai highlight).The actual hotel is seconds away from luxury boutiques and is well connected for all of the main tourist destinations.All in all, an excellent hotel, which comes highly recommended."
228,1913,"Apr 13 2006 	Regularly stay at the Soho Grand	I enjoy the comfortable rooms and beds, the great service, and a quiet night's sleep. Great access to restaurants and shopping as well as NYU."
229,1913,"Apr 11 2006	Still sophisticated and unpretentious	Just spent the weekend at the SoHo Grand Hotel. I have stayed at the hotel many times and continue to feel that the hotel strikes a near-perfect balance between attentive service and respect for my privacy.The rooms are very comfortable, the staff is elegant and fun, and I especially appreciate the fact that the doormen and the bellmen all know my name and genuinely seem happy to see me when I return."
230,1913,"Apr 9 2006 	Location and Service!	Stayed at the Soho Grand recently on business, and found it fantastic in terms of service and location. Just a block from the heart of Soho shops and restaurants, Chinatown, subways, etc.The service was fabulous as well. Everyone was very helpful and full of smiles, which always makes a difference.The lounge becomes a great hangout place at night, and is a great place to have a morning coffee.I'll definitely stay here again."
231,1913,"Apr 5 2006	I Wasn't Going to Do This	It's not like the secret isn't out. I mean, for years people have been staying at The SoHo Grand. But I never did because when I went to Tripadvisor, I was some times scared off by the uneven reviews. Which lead me to stay in many different places: The Rivington, Hotel Gansevoort, The W, etc. But I must say, and I really am loathe to write this but feel a certain responsibility to like-minded individuals, The SoHo Grand is the best hotel I've stayed in in the city. Period.First off, it's beautiful, and beautiful in a New York way. So while your personal tastes might be one thing or another, the SoHo Grand captures New York City (all the good parts anyway) and puts it into every single detail, large and small: the black and white photography adorning the walls, the dress code on the sleek and handsome staff, the large, glorious coffee cup waiting for you in your hotel room -- it's even present right down to the glorious Terrazzo floors you step upon when you first enter this stunning hotel. As far as the guest rooms go, each is so comfortable, even homey. The bathrooms have that lovely white brick-style New York'y tile, the bathtubs are deep, roomy, but not too large -- which I, a bath person, do not enjoy, the water pressure reminds one of why every New Yorker brags about New York plumbing. The lotion has a lovely vanilla aroma, and the shampoo actually WORKS! And even the hardware like the sink handles, etc. are that sort of white porcelain with black writing you'd think you'd see if you were staying in some grand hotel in the Manhattan of the twenties or forties.Maybe the SoHo Grand is what the Algonquin was like in the day (I've stayed there too -- don't bother now, unfortunately). And let me say the views on the north side of the hotel are stunning (I can't vouch for the south, I didn't stay there). Picture postcard. You'll probably have a photographic view of the Empire State Building smack-dab in the middle of your large and spacious bedroom window. Can it get better than that?Yes. Because the bed is the best in NYC. Or put it this way, it's right up there with The Hotel Gansevoort and I must say, better than my own. I'm thinking of buying the whole thing. And one thing I found considerate and unusual are the draperies. They have a thick heavy, cloth drapery you pull down that very efficiently blocks out much light and, I would venture to guess, noise as well. This is a commodity in Manhattan.As far as the social aspect goes, the bar and lounge are hopping but with some interesting people and ACTUAL NEW YORKERS. Coming from NY myself, and having lived in the city about a decade ago, I love places that attract the real-deal people. And it's a sophisticated lot. You're not going to see Bridge &amp; Tunnel people here. I think they'd be kicked out -- okay, that's mean, but you know, they just would feel uncomfortable. This is a high-caliber place. Not snooty, necessarily, but certainly a scene where taste, culture and a little bit of wealth and worldliness prevail. Like SoHo itself and that's another thing. Of course you have to evaluate what part of the city you'd like to be in, but for my money, SoHo is the most exciting, beautiful area and for some reason, right now, it's better than it's been in years. I can't quite pin it down. The whole city seems to be alive in a way it hasn't for years and SoHo is capturing that. That's pretty thrilling and certainly makes my heart swoon for all New Yorkers who've been through such difficult and tragic times.But back to the hotel: Free WiFi in the Lounge for guests as well as a well-functioning Business Center on the 3rd floor are very helpful. So are the people. The doors were held open for me, if there were ANY problems Axl and the people at the front dest took care of it right away. And they were kind, remembered who you were and took care of you. In fact, the staff was much better than the models at The Rivington (my review, Nov. 14, 2005, is a little off. After this experience, I'd give it a 3 not a 4 rating). But I don't want to mislead. The employees at The Grand are also easy on the eyes, but unlike the Rivington's Abercrombie &amp; Fitch runway concierges, in addition The SoHo's people are super-duper competent, friendly and efficient. Sorry, Rivington, but the truth is the truth. Perhaps you've improved in all this time, and if so, my apologies.Oh, and before I forget, if you request it, they put luscious goosedown pillows in your room and a goldfish for a pet -- which I loved. Not as much as the girl I met in the elevator who requested to take hers back with her to Ohio. But they said no, he'd die. She looked so sad but they let her carry him around in a plastic bag for awhile. See, this hotel, in every respect, is the best place on the planet.Which is why, fellow travellers, I thought I shouldn't tell you. Because I want to be Eloise and stay there myself all the time and always have my special room (the actual number I choose NOT to share with you) and just have the place to myself like a favorite restaurant before the word gets out. But you know, when something is so good, and people have treated you so well, I feel they must be rewarded as hugely as possible. And besides, I only get to go to NYC once or twice a year. With that said, and my desire is to always be able to stay there -- no ifs ands or buts, let's just keep this little note between us, okay?"
232,1913,"Mar 17 2006	Loved the room	The Soho Grand was a gorgeous hotel, with a very courteous staff. What we loved most was the queen size bed. It was very very comfortable and the linens and comforter were exceptional. For all of you that have trouble sleeping in hotel beds try out this hotel, we got a great nights sleep."
233,1913,"Mar 13 2006	Classic and cool	The location of the Soho Grand just can't be beat...it's right in the middle of everything. The rooms are predictably small (welcome to NY), but not claustrophobic. They are very well-decorated, as is the rest of the hotel. I have stayed in a regular room, as well as in the Penthouse suite (complete with 600 sq. ft. terrace). While the size of the rooms varied, they were both very well-appointed, beautiful, and clean. I don't rely on the service of hotels much, but in my opinion it's good when you don't notice it (i.e., you don't have to ask for things because they've taken care of everything for you). In this regard, the service at the SG was excellent. It's pricey, but worth it...particularly for a weekend in NY."
234,1913,"Mar 10 2006 	I had a res Soho had no room	I had a guaranteed reservation for a room on Wed night. After having dinner nearby, went to the Soho Grand at 9:00pm to check in. They had no room for me; &quot;over sold&quot;. I offered to even pay more for a higher class room .. anything. No room. I had heard this could be a problem from a cowrker who endured a similar experience, and I went as far as to press the reservationist ahead of time. I was ensured that there would be a room available for me. Well, no room. Their offer was to pay the $5 for a cab ride over to the Tribeca Grand. Nothing else. Once at the Tribeca Grand, the only room supposedly available was on the 3rd floor overlooking the bar area. And, the door was already open when I got there. I found out from another guest in the hall that someone else had just been in the room, apparently not liked it and left! Soho Grand ... Tribeca Grand ... These places are bars/restaurants that also happen to have hotels. Service is nowhere to be found. Quality of product is terrible. Will never return."
235,1913,"Mar 9 2006 	Great Hotel in the best part of NYC	I love this hotel and its sister hotel down the street, the Tribeca Grand. The staff is awesome and very helpful with everything. The rooms are small but stocked with so many amenities that you feel at home immediately. The location in Lower Manhattan isn't convenient for Midtown (but who needs to go there anyway!) Cool SoHo shops are a mere few blocks away, everything else is a short cab or subway ride away.The SoHo Grand is my first choice when I am in NYC!"
236,1913,"Mar 7 2006	loved my stay	great hotel, great location, great continental breakfast delivered right to your room, perfect place to stay in the city."
237,1913,"Mar 6 2006	An ideal location staff and amenities	The Soho Grand proved to be the ideal location and hotel for our trip to NYC. A drink upon arrival awaiting you at the front desk, bell men who could grab you a taxi in under one minute, goldfish in the room and a bed comfortable enough for a queen. We loved it! One additional perk is it's closeness to Soho and Chinatown."
238,1913,"Mar 4 2006	Soho Hot	We had a great night at the Soho Grand. The staff was friendly and accomodating and our uptown facing room had great amenities like a flat screen tv, cd player and internet connection. The rooms are minimalist but comfortable. The lounge was a great place for a late night drink. Adrienne at the front desk was one of the most accomodating invividuals I have ever met while traveling."
239,1913,"Mar 3 2006 	Great Place Great Service	As a frequent traveller to NYC, I've stayed in many hotels, but my strong preference is the Soho Grand. The location is great, convenient to work, restaurants, nightlife, but there are a number of hotels in that area. What sets it apart is--among other things--the people and the service.As a frequent guest at the hotel, I requested a minor modification on an upcoming visit. To my pleasant surprise, they responded very quickly to my request, and went out of their way to ensure that the request was carried through.Sometimes it's the little things that the most memorable and keep you coming back."
240,1913,"Mar 3 2006 	I can't fathom who is writing in with the great reviews of this mediocre hotel	Having stayed at this hotel for four days in Dec 2005, I can't imagine why anyone would write a glowing review of this place. I travel a great deal - I've been to 32 countries and lived on three different continents - and I think I have a reasonable basis for comparision. In line with many of the other reviews here, I thought the staff were completely fake with an overblown air of superiority. Personally, I wouldn't describe it as 'great service' when the people who get paid to service us, the hotel's customers, treat us as if we are annoying interruptions to some other more important task. And why dripping with attitude? I suspect not one of them could have afforded to shell out the $600/night the hotel was taking off of us. Also like many of the other reviewers, our bathroom was not very clean, the water pressure was feeble at best, the shower drain ineffectual, and we were chronically undersupplied with toilet paper and tissues. Believe me, there are a number of circumstances under which it is less than pleasant to have to call the front desk for toilet paper!One final note - we arrived from a long transatlantic flight and, as another reviewer complained, we spent 20mins just trying to find the check-in desk. They could have shelled out $50 of the $2400 we gave them to put up a sign directing guests upstairs. If this hotel charged $200-250/night I wouldn't be writing this negative review. However, at $600/night I expected a bit more from the SoHo Grand."
241,1913,"Mar 2 2006 	Lipstick on a Pig -- Two-Star Mediocrity Masquerading as a 4-Star Hotel	Reading the reviews on this site, it seems that there are two Soho Grands, a hip, trendy 4-star hotel and a two-star with cramped rooms, spotty cleanliness and rude staff. Unfortunately, I stayed at the second one (and saw no hint that the first exists).The rooms are pitifully small, and not particularly clean. There is minimal space to do anything but sleep. The bathrooms are likewise a tight squeeze. Moreover, their beds/bedding are not up to 4-star standards. These problems were not unique to a single room, because I was moved twice before finally giving up and suffering through a night there.The first room was a smoking room that absolutely reeked, had stains all over the carpets, and scratched-up furniture. The second room, supposedly a non-smoking room, likewise reeked of smoke and obviously had not been well-cleaned since there was a disgusting, rusting pair of tweezers laying in the middle of the tiny table that doubled as the room's &quot;desk.&quot; (I have a photo). I offered to leave if they would refund my money, but they refused. Finally, I was moved to what they described as an &quot;upgraded&quot; room, which I guess means &quot;a room that does not stink,&quot; because that was the only noticable improvement.Also, don't expect a sound night's sleep. The SoHo Grand is located just above the exit from the Holland Tunnel. Know what comes through the Holland Tunnel at night? Trucks. Lots of them. Big, loud trucks rolling out of the tunnel all night long, their snorting and belching motor and exhaust noises only being amplified by the echo chamber effect of the tunnel.The staff's snooty and unhelpful attitude only adds insult to injury. Worse still, the front desk and guest services were badly understaffed. As a result, several times I had to wait in line or on hold for 10 minutes for the pleasure of being subjected to their shabby treatment.True, the bathrooms have nice toiletries and the room has a plasma screen TV, but this is just smearing lipstick on a pig. If the SoHo Grand were advertised and priced as the 2-star hotel that it is, I would not complain (of course, I would never have booked it). It appears that most of the guests of this establishment are European tourists, who seem not to know what an American 4-star hotel is supposed to be like. (Perhaps ignorance is bliss.) Unfortunately, I have spent hundreds of nights in dozens of New York City hotels over the years, so I know better.Bottom line, this dump compares unfavorably to a Holiday Inn Express or a Hampton Inn. If you are expecting quality, stay away, stay very far away."
242,1913,"Mar 2 2006	Beautiful hotel top-notch service	This is a beautiful, hip hotel in a great part of town. Everyone on the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful, and all of our requests were treated with care. I really can't think of anything they could have done better!"
243,1913,"Feb 27 2006	Soho Grand - Amazing Pet-Friendly Special Occasion Weekend Destination	This is a terrific luxury weekend getaway place -- the staff are so welcoming and helpful. The location is also stellar if you enjoy walking around a variety of great neighborhoods (with or without your dog!).There is no better place for pets. Our Collie LOVED this place more than any other place we've ever taken him -- from the bed and bowls for him in our room to the abundance of attention in the public areas, including being able to join us for cocktails in the lobby lounge area -- which was a really fun scene filled with characters and trendsters on weekend nights. He was truly welcome (as opposed to just permitted or tolerated at many nice hotels).The room itself was small (welcome to Manhattan), but really well-appointed with nice views of the busy street on one side and the Empire State building in the distance on the other. Surprisingly, the widescreen TV is really low quality equipment for such a nice place otherwise. The bed was great. The bathroom was fine.Housekeeping was efficient and charming when we met them -- they handled the dog in the room really well.Twice, the room service breakfast service and food quality was the only low point of our stay. The lounge area food later in the day was far better for some reason. The communal coffee service by the ice machine in the hallway is also adequate but not impressive.The fitness center is small and sufficient for basic workout needs."
244,1913,"Feb 23 2006 	Cool place	Cool hotel, a nice mix of industrial, euro and old world. On the order of the W, but without as much attitude. Plasma TV, soft bed. Great location in SoHo near financial district worked well for me on business - and the price was a bit better than most NYC hotels. Would stay again"
245,1913,Feb 21 2006	Weekend haven	It's a beautiful hotel; very simple and elegant. The location is great -- perfect for walking the city and access to good restaurants.
246,1913,"Feb 20 2006	Nice Locale Mediocre Accommodations	I booked a stay at the SoHo Grand based on its trendy reputation and proximity to SOHO's shops and hang-outs. The trip was a late valentine's gift into NY, so I was aiming for something fun, Soho-ish, but sexy/romantic. As expected, location was nice and the lounge/bar were enjoyable. Now granted I did get a regular suite, I'm disappointed to say the hotel and its service was significantly less impressive. The Pros - Unbeatable location - Great Bar and Lounge - Innovative ammenities (e.g. iPod station option, CD's in room) - Decore consistent with the feel of the neighorhood - Nice viewThe Gripes - Many of the service staff seem pretty junior and un-trained in hotel service.  - My bed at home was better - Poorly stocked toiletries - Smelly room - The TV may have been the one I gave to goodwill 10 yrs ago. - More trash in front of the hotel than any other neighoring store. I mean a lot of trash.  - Poor quality towels. - The list sort of goes on...(unfortunately)I have no problem with staying at motel, in fact, I sort of like it, just not paying nearly $300 for a room. Overall, the hotel prices expensively because of its great location, which is good enough leverage. I can't recommend against because its in a great part of town. You may want to look elswhere and do a little more homework before you stay at the Soho Grand."
247,1913,"Feb 20 2006	Great location	Great view, Great location, Great ambience, Great City"
248,1913,Feb 19 2006	Wonderful hotel.	We stayed a night at the Soho Grand and had a wonderful experience. The Staff was welcoming and efficient (a glass of champagne offered at check-in was a lovely touch). Location in NY was great. Can't wait for another excuse to stay there again.
249,1913,"Feb 13 2006	Very nice	This hotel was absolutely outstanding. The service was amazing, and booking it was easy and simple. Although I didn't stay in the room long, it was of a very high standard.Will definitely stay again."
250,1913,"Feb 11 2006	A room with a view	We treated ourselves to a long weekend at the Soho Grand over the Thanksgiving holiday. We flew all the way from CPH to my hometown and arrived at the hotel tired and jetlagged. Check-in was warm and friendly (remember this is NYC). Upon arrival, they noticed it was our birthdays (my man and I have birthdays 3 days apart) and delivered a deliciious chocolate cake to our room. How thoughtful. The service throughout our stay was extremely high. Room service was fast, delicious and expensive but worth it. The rooms are small. Again, this is New York where space is a commodity. But the small thoughtful amenities such as not only a cd player in the room, but also a varied selection of music, puts the Soho Grand a step above your traditional hotel. On Thanksgiving Day, we were treated to free-flowing hot pumpkin cider. Best of all was the view we woke up to every morning and went to sleep to every night. My hometown never looked better. The Soho Grand is what a downtown NYC hotel should be, plus a whole lot more."
251,1913,Feb 6 2006	Beyond my expectations	I truly enjoyed my stay at the Soho Grand. My room was spacious and lovely. I will stay there again and again.
252,1913,"Feb 6 2006	soho seduction	You can not beat the soho grand for a romantic weekend away. My wife was shocked that I took her to shop in soho for the weekend, the hotel is great and easy to everything in soho. The package for the weekend of seduction is a big plus."
253,1913,"Jan 31 2006 	Stay at Soho Grand	My daughter and I came in from Florida to the Soho Grand hotel. We throughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The design and decor of the hotel was unique and appealing. The restaurant was fun and had good food. There were good places to shop and eat just steps away from the hotel. It was out of the busy part of New York, but still had plenty of energy."
254,1913,"Jan 24 2006	Lots of style...needs more substance	I have stayed twice in the Soho Grand , once on business and once for a romantic weekend with my wife.It is an incredibly cool and hip hotel. The staff are ultra smooth and cool but are not overtly friendly -- they seem to look upon guests as a nusiance.Rooms are small but comfortable -- room service never answer the phone --- probably checking themselves in the mirror.The bar at weekends is extremely busy and there is no benefit in being a resident -- you have to queue along with everybody else for a table.That said we did spy a whole bunch of celebrities etc in the bar which please my wife no end !Once you know what you are dealing with (e.g. my first morning there I had breakfast in the dining room -- my bacon and eggs was served by a lady who looked like she stepped straight out of the Robert Palmer Addicted to Love video !) then its good but don't expect an overtly warm welcome !It is extremely cool but not very friendly.The location however is second to none -- you have all of Soho etc on your doorstep --great bars /restaurants/ shops."
255,1913,Jan 19 2006	Good as Usual	Returned to the Soho Grand for 3 days over MLK weekend. Had a great time as usual. The people at the concierge desk are always extremely helpful and very pleasant. The remodeled rooms look great.
256,1913,"Jan 19 2006	A Hotel With the Comforts of Home	Nice concept for a hotel. I enjoyed the fact that it is not top-heavy with staff. The whole experience feels like you are staying in a luxury apartment. I always enjoy my stays at the Soho Grand. The staff are courteous, the service good and the public spaces are very nice. I recently discovered a website called Tablet Hotels and have since spent some time daydreaming about staying all over the world. When it comes down to actually doing it, they always have the best price."
257,1913,Jan 19 2006	Soho Grand or stay home!	The Soho Grand just 'gets it'. The only place we will stay when we go to NY. great staff. They will even give you goldfish if you like!
258,1913,"Jan 16 2006	Amina is the Greatest Concierge	Amina Blacksher, the Concierge, really made the our stay memorable."
259,1913,"Jan 15 2006 	Hip Hotel Great Neighborhood	I stayed at the Soho Grand for four days on my first trip to New York. The Queen Deluxe room was much larger than I would have expected for a NY hotel, and was appointed tastefully. Large down pillows and soft sheets made for a comfortable sleep. When I had down time it was relaxing to lounge on the bed and watch the flat screen TV. The hotel is newer (built in 1996), but has a retro quality. The lobby has a very cool atmosphere with eclectic music playing softly throughout the day. At night, a DJ played in the lounge. Location is excellent with plenty of restaurants nearby. Close to several subway stations as well. Unique hotel in a cool neighborhood is a nice break from the lights and noise of mid-town. Bonus feature- Soho Grand emailed me prior to my arrival see if I wanted a loaner iPod and Bose docking station, as well as a Goldfish in my room (Yes, Goldfish)."
260,1913,"Jan 14 2006	Badly done Soho Grand Badly done	I live near NYC and go there freqently but seldom have occasion to actually stay there. Recently relatives came to town for New Year's Eve and chose to stay at the Soho Grand. I was delighted as it was a hotel I pass often and read about but had never actually been in it for any reason. My relatives invited me and my spouse to join them for New Year's Eve celebrations at the hotel. Sounds like a fun, right? WRONG.We arrived at the hotel at the appointed time and were immediately sent to stand in a line to get wrist bands. I don't know about you, but the last time I had to wear a wrist band to get in and out of a function was in high school. Think up something a little more elegant, Grand, come on. Next, we passed through three different checks to get to the table. There were bouncers everywhere. If you can't control the crowd in your hotel, then perhaps you shouldn't offer the party. It was bizaar and again, not elegant.The cost of $200 pp included an &quot;open bar&quot; and I will say, that any drink you could order was available. The problem was finding the waiter to be able to order. Easy to offer an open bar if you don't take drink orders, huh?I will praise the chef. The food was very good. There were some problems with the buffet set-up and trying to keep warm foods warm but overall, I must say the food was well done, original and a good variety. Again, we had to stand in line. Seems the Soho Grand likes the Disney approach to dealing with guests.Next, the entertainment. The entertainment for the evening's event consisted of blaring recorded music, a TV screen mounted in the dining room (no, I'm not kidding) tuned to Times Square's festivities. I guess to allow the guests at the Soho Grand to live vicariously through the group at Times Square. In the dining room one large table consisted of a family of ten people. This family group included two children under the age of 10. It was really fun having the kids blow their horns in our ears.As the evening went on, there was less and less evidence of any wait staff tending the dining room. We had to go to physically find the waiter to get some champagne poured for the New Year's toast.That's just my personal experience with the Soho Grand. My relative, instead has told me that when the hotel was informed of the problems we encountered at the party, the hotel apolgized and offered a free upgrade to a suite on their next visit. The coulple were already staying in a suite. There seemed to be little if any concern about the dissatisfaction of these guests.Finally, my relative's review of the hotel and rooms was that they were very small (not unusual in NY) and not at all elegant or warm. She did not understand why the Soho Grand has such a trendy reputation. She was not impressed."
261,1913,"Jan 12 2006 	Luxury pretense but no substance	I have stayed at the Soho Grand on repeated business trips throughout the past year. My company has agreed corporate rates with them, so I am forced to stay there. I believe the Soho Grand has all the veneer of being chic, exclusive, luxurious, but fails to understand that this needs to be backed by the same level of service.While I could forgive the tiny rooms, their customer service is consistently bad with every visit. The check-in staff are inattentive and unhelpful. They make you feel like an intruder, rather than a guest. By comparison, I have stayed at different W Hotels in Manhattan, and by the second visit, I was greeted by name.Room service is poor, with cold arrivals and mixed orders.The Soho Grand has no idea of how to run a hotel, especially with repeat clients. It's sad that even when I'm not paying, the hotel is horrible."
262,1913,Jan 9 2006	Great time at the SoHo Grand	I just spent the weekend at the SoHo Grand with my mother for her birthday-we had a terrific time at the hotel and loved the location-we got to the hotel very early (9:30am) and they checked us in immediately-we decided to switch rooms from a SoHo style room to a Classic style room (which is cheaper and we thought looked the same-except without a plasma tv-just a regular tv-they say the SoHo rooms are renovated but we did not see any difference and would recommend the savings with the Classic style room) and they switched us immediately and with no hassel-they also gave us 2 drink vouchers for the bar when I told them we were there for my mom's birthday which was very nice-the concierge was helpful and the bar area is very nice and has great atmosphere-my only complaint about the room was that we found a piece of candy on the floor from the previous guest-otherwise room was clean-but the rooms are very small-I expected that for downtown NYC-it was fine for a weekend but not sure where would put luggage for a long trip-we did look at 60 Thompson (another hotel nearby) and that was a little cheaper and nice as well-would stay at 60 Thompson as well (same location essentially but a little funkier) but the SoHo Grand has a great feel to it. The other nice touch was at checkout they honored a verbal statement from a parking attendant about a lower parking rate than what was on my bill. Overall wonderful experience.
263,1913,"Jan 9 2006	Very dissapointed by the Soho Grand Hotel !	The Soho seems to live on its reputation. The building is nice, and the bar is cosy.But :a. the rooms are much smaller than they appear on the website,b. the staff level, the facilities, the amenities, are not consistant with the price : we waited almost half an hour to check in, one lamp in the room was out of order, the key for the minibar was lost and it took them an hour to bring a new one, there was no bath foam, the robes were whether durty whether torn, the room service forgot our order and we had to call them three times before they realise it and finally bring us our meal, which was desappointing, the butter was in a little pot with old ketchup in it !!We were very disappointed and, as a result, decided to move to the Mercer Hotel after 4 nigths, for the last 4 nights of our stay in NYC. And the Mercer is great, the quality difference is worth two our four times the price difference, which is not so big...Enjoy !"
264,1913,"Jan 4 2006	Soho So fab	Our second stay at the Soho Grand in as many years was just as wonderful as the first. Rooms and service excellent, location just perfect for wining, dining and shopping in the soho/broadway area plus just a hop over to meatpacking district. Not cheap, so the rooms feel a little small compared with a similar priced room in the UK but no less luxurious."
265,1913,Jan 3 2006	Soho Grand Hotel Recommended for Everyone	The Soho Grand Hotel deserves its four star rating. The accommodations were first class. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Even our eleven and thirteen year old boys were impressed. We could not have enjoyed our overnight trip to Manhattan more.
266,1913,"Jan 3 2006	Soho Grand Hotel is Elegant and Hip	Over the New Year's week-end, my husband and I chose to stay at the Soho Grand Hotel. We found it extremely comfortable, easy going and incredibly well decorated in a modern but elegant style that many people can enjoy. We have stayed at modern hotels before that really don't hit that balance between modern and relaxing. But the Soho Grand has large comfy sofas and chairs in the breakfast/drinks area next to the lobby which enhanced our experinence towards the more comfortable range of the spectrum. The room, a deluxe King, was small but very well appointed with fabulous bed linens and nightside reading lamps, and a handsome dresser and armoire for clothes. The flat screen t.v. could have had a better picture. The bed was perfect for sleeping- very comfortable. Street noise is audible so maybe an interior room would be advisable for those who are sensative to noise. The staff was both accomodating and friendly. The breakfast was very good- great eggs, fruit, waffles and capuccinos.( Fun hip music without being overbearing.) The concierge did not come through as much as we had hoped so any dinner reservations you want to make that require a phone call that is one month in advance I suggest you do yourself. Otherwise they were knowledable and very helpful. 4 stars!!"
267,1913,"Jan 3 2006	New year's eve at the soho grand	the hotel was as nice as boutique hotels get in manhattan. the turn down service is markedly thoughtful, and the level of hospitality is a level above the majority of hotels.that being said, there were two issues with the hotel:1. i requested a goldfish and a bose sounddock three days before I checked in. It took 3 phone calls and 2.5 hours for me to get it.2. room service food was below average, not something that i would expect from a 1st tier boutique hotel. but despite those two annoyances, the hotel is stunning, and i would gladly go back."
268,1913,"Jan 2 2006	Great New Years Eve Stay at SoHo Grand	I was a little nervous about staying at the SoHo Grand for New Years Eve. When I lived in NYC a few years ago, this place was as trendy as they come. I was happily surprised that every member of the staff seemed to appreciate our business from the front desk to the bell service. The rooms on the north side of the hotel are smaller but not too small and the city views are incredible! Part of the New Years Eve package had plenty of little surprises too. They offered glass of champagne at the front desk, there were cookies waiting in our room for us. The 2nd night they left chocolate covered strawberrys and went out of the way to make sure we took advantage of free breakfast offered to &quot;Grand Guests&quot;. Be sure to sign up for this Grand Guest program before you book. Bottom line: the SoHo Grand gave us a wonderful stay and we'll be sure to stay there next time we're in town."
269,1913,"Jan 2 2006	Loved the bed	Great bed, slept very well. Upon arrival it's not very clear if you've never stayed that the lobby for checking in is on the first floor, and not ground floor where the concierge is. I waited 10mins with my baggage before someone asked me if I was checking in.Room was nice, clean - Tv could use a dvd player and better tuning on tv of the channels as the sound and image were not very crisp.I was dissapointed to find that the wireless internet acess was charged as an extra, and was not that fast when connected.But overall a very nice experience, the food was amazing, the chef is very good (and this is coming from someone living in Paris used to very fine dining)! Location is great for shopping in soho, much cozier than the atmosphere around the 5th ave etc.-Damien"
270,1913,"Jan 1 2006	Grand !! at the Soho Grand	Upon arrival to the Soho Grand Hotel you are completely enveloped by a feeling of style &amp; class . From the warm greeting I received by the doormen, to the wonderful restaurant recommendations given by the concierge, my entire stay was fabulous. It is away from the hustle and bustle of time square etc..., yet it is close enough to enjoy a short cab ride into mid town. The surrounding shops and boutiques are great, and all within walking distance! Although this past visit was not my first to the big NYC, it was my first at the Soho Grand. I will definitely be a repeat patron!!"
271,1913,"Dec 31 2005	the soho grand was very chic!	The staff was very friendly, especially for New York. And if you have a dog, take him or her with you. Everyone was nice to the dog. They even provided a bed and 2 bowls for the dog.The bed for the humans was also very nice. Sleek contemporary design. We'd stay again."
272,1913,Dec 31 2005	Another nice stay at the Sono Grand	always have a good experience at the Soho Grand; especially nice bathrooms with good amenities; be sure and check their website--often good deals there.
273,1913,"Dec 30 2005	Modern Elegance	My second stay at the Soho Grand was even better than my first....I brought my husband this time for the Seduction in Soho package. We loved the chocolates waiting for us when we arrived, and breakfast in bed every morning was divine. The staff was friendly and attentive as always. We loved the comfy bed and fine linens, and the Cafe Mocha just steps from our room was a great way to start each morning. Do not miss an opportunity to have drinks in the ultra cool lounge area, may I recommend the Perfect Ten martini? Also, the concierge is a great help...got us in at Mercer Kitchen which I highly recommend. Skip the touristy mid-town crowds and average hotels....the Soho neighborhood is lovely and the Soho Grand is First Class! Can't wait to go back...."
274,1913,"Dec 28 2005	Soho Grand was great	We stayed at the Soho Grand &amp; loved it. It was in a great location (next to lots of shops &amp; restaurants), the food was great, and hotel staff was very friendly!"
275,1913,"Dec 23 2005	The Best Hotel in Downtown....and one of the best in the NYC	The Soho Grand is always my first choice of any place to stay in NYC. People seem to complain about the size of the room.....perhaps they should get out more! Admittedly, the rooms are on the small side, but I am not there to hold meetings or orgies....well, maybe mini-origies! But the rest of the hotel should meet everyone's expectations and needs. The food and drink selections are above just about any other hotel, the lounge area is THE BEST, and most importantly, the staff is beyond compare. From the moment I get out of my cab and am greeted by Martin, Jose, Chris (or any of the doormen for that matter), I feel like I am home. In fact, Martin and Jose have been greeting guests almost from opening day of the SGH - - that speaks volumes to me about the kind of people who work there. The desk-staff as well as the concierge are always eager to make my stay as pleasant as possible...special kudos to Mildred!!"
276,1913,"Dec 20 2005	Love the SoHo Grand	I stayed at the SoHo Grand this past weekend and had an excellent experience. The staff was very nice and attentive. The rooms are small like every other hotel in NYC. 225sqft-250sqft. However, the cocktail lounge makes this place one of my favorite in NYC. You really don't have to leave the hotel for entertainment. The bed was ultra comfy. The waitresses looked like runway models each and every one. Decor is awesome. I've stayed at alot of nice hotels in NYC and the SoHo grand makes my top 3. Proximity to excellent shopping and restaurants is just another great feature of this hotel. Bloomingdale's Soho is a 2 min. walk."
277,1913,"Dec 20 2005	Loved it!!	Returned home on the 8th of December and I cannot wait to go back. I read such mixed reviews on this hotel so I was quite apprehensive. I needn't have worried, from stepping out of the cab to getting back in for my return journey home 4 days later my stay was perfect. The staff were totally professional, but still approachable and friendly and very very helpful. The rooms are small compared to some hotels but we didn't feel cramped at all, even taking into account our 3 huge suitcases. We were on the 11th floor and had brilliant views of the Chrysler building, Empire State etc. Watch out for the measures in the hotel bar they are very friendly!!!! We had quite a night in there, or so my husband tells me, I don't remember a thing and I only had 2 drinks!!The food in the hotel is excellent and there are also plenty of great places to eat in the area around the hotel. The shopping is also good.In short I would definitely recommend this hotel."
278,1913,"Dec 6 2005	Always welcome at Soho Grand	My friend and I meet at the Soho Grand every December. Every year we are treated well and the doormen greet guests with a smile! The hotel is clean and staffed with professional, courteous people. Wonderful hotel!"
279,1913,"Dec 2 2005	Loved the Soho Grand Hotel	My boyfriend and I stayed for 2 nights at the Soho Grand - business for him, pleasure for me. It was fabulous and lived up to all my expectations. The location was wonderful, Jason the Concierge was so helpful with restaurant reservations and spa reservations for me. (The Soho Sanctury (spa) women only, Pilates, full spa, lovely locker room, excellent service, perfect, just a few blocks away). Room Service was great, the rooms were big and nice (with bathtub, comfortable bed. Would def. stay there over and over."
280,1913,"Dec 1 2005 	a great hotel	a great hotel, with great service in a very hip area of New York."
281,1913,"Nov 30 2005	Best place to stay!	Everything was perfect, breakfast in bed, grand margarita, perfectly clean; employees are intelligent and helpful. What else can you say?"
282,1913,"Nov 30 2005	Find another hotel	For $500/night, I should have no negative comments but I do, but first, the positives.The room was clean, comfy (although small), with a nice view. I ordered up the &quot;Seduction in SoHo&quot; package.Negatives: these are small, but I feel for the price, this place should have impeccable service and attention to detail. Firstly, I was supposed to get a champagne toast on arrival - part of the package. It didn't happen. Secondly, I received an email saying I could have an iPod docking station. I requested it, and again, it didn't happen. Only one cup for coffee delivered on a brekfast for two. A no-wait check out via TV didn't work - ironically the TV continued to say &quot;please wait&quot; for 15 minutes. I shut it off. The cleaning staff was a little too eager to get in the room in the morning, in one case without knocking, thank goodness for lock bars.The final kicker, I got an email from the manager after my return asking me to post positives to this site, but if I had negatives to send them to him directly.Stay somewhere else and save some money. I think this place was great at one time, so I've been told. I had friends tell me to stay at the Tribeca Grand instead...should have listened to them."
283,1913,"Nov 28 2005	Great hotel and location	I have just returned from staying at Soho Grand on the Seduction package which was superb. Inludes breakfast, discounts on some shops in area, complimentary cocktails in their very cool bar, champagne on arrival and candles and roses in the room! We stayed in the recent renovated rooms which were great. Spacious, very trendy with all lastest mod cons (plasma TV, hire of ipods). Excellent location as well. Concierge very knowledgable too. Couldn't fault it. Definitely worth the money."
284,1913,"Nov 28 2005	Great Experience - as always!	I have been staying at the Soho Grand for about 5 years now - it is a great place to stay and the service is always phenomenal. I am in New York 5-6 times/year and in the past have tried other hotels (New York Palace, Plaza, etc . . .) and albeit they were all nice hotels, I would choose The Soho Grand over them any day!"
285,1913,"Nov 28 2005	Soho Grand was great!	We stayed at the Soho Grand over American Thanksgiving. It was our second time there and we had a really good experience. The woman who checked us in was very friendly -- big warm smile and a &quot;welcome back&quot;. We had booked a regular Queen size bedroom and were upgraded to one of the newly renovated rooms. Very comfortable bed -- three or four different types of pillows -- from soft and feather to harder and foam -- nice duvets, a welcome plate of cookies and water and a personalized note from the manager -- generous bath products, windows you could open a titch to get some fresh air. They also threw in a free continental breakfast. All good. Small complaints -- not very good hot water pressure in the shower, especially in the evening for some reason. Hair dryer old and smelly (hard to explain, but the warm air coming out of it had an odd smell). We'd periodically see our check-in woman -- always very warm with a big smile. She was great! All of the staff were open and friendly, including the guys on the door, though the concierge(s) could be a bit stiff. Great drinks at the bar with a really good D.J. spinning fun tunes. Fabulous location. I've read some negative things about the Soho Grand, but both times (and especially this one), we've had a positive experience. We'll go back in a flash! Love the location."
286,1913,Nov 26 2005	soho grand/nice	soho grand is a nice hotel. the rooms are small but with comfortable beds and good baths. the service is very friendly. best is the convenience. their location in soho is perfect. short walk to all shops and restaurants. we would go back.
287,1913,"Nov 25 2005	I want to live in this hotel!	my husband chose this hotel to stay in after seeing it in the sopranos, and I just loved it on sight. Funky, modern decor in both the public areas and rooms, friendly and helpful staff and the best cocktails (I recommend the &quot;perfect ten&quot;) This hotel is right in the middle of soho, but the area isn't too noisy. Our room was on the top floor with a fantastic view of the manhattan skyline outside the window. The room was generously sized with gorgeous frette bed linen, well stocked (but damn expensive) mini bar, big tv, safe etc, and a bose docking station was provided for my ipod which is a great touch. Breakfast was promptly delivered with fantastic coffee, and the hotel is pet friendly so there were plenty of cute dogs running around to cuddle.We also had eddie izzard staying just down the hall!The only cause for concern I had was that my in-room gold fish looked seriously in need of therapy!!I've stayed in a lot of hotels in my life, and this was one of the best. I can't recommend it more - it may be expensive but it's definitely worth it."
288,1913,"Nov 24 2005	Great Location but soooooooo noisy	Just had a 3 day break at the Soho Grand. The public areas are wonderful, very trendy. The bar is hip &amp; fun, the staff friendly. But our room was tiny &amp; dark and very very hot. Couldn't sort the air con out. Wonderfully the windows did open but the traffic noise was non-stop - yellow cabs hooting and honking. (7th floor so quite high). Felt the hotel was overpriced, not very comfy and we wouldn't go back again. There is too much competition. The Soho area is a must to stay in."
289,1913,"Nov 21 2005 	Will not go back to the SOHO Grand.	Upon entering the room at 12:00 am: Our toilet wasnt working. Our television wasnt working The night manager moved us, which was decent, but not until I insisted.  The rooms were like saunas. We were very uncomfortable the whole time. Our register didnt produce any cool. Then, it was our anniversery, and my gift was taken from the room, no one told us, and after I hunted it down, did I find it in security, but not until the wrapping had been removed on both items. The hotel is situated in a find area, and its almost the only game in soho right now, but I would NOT hurry back. For the money, 499.00 per night, I am used to a LOT better room. You obviously can get that for a room, but I felt ripped off. I travel extensively. I am in hotels all over the world. I think that for the money, I can find a place much more amenable."
290,1913,Nov 21 2005	Great Hotel 	Great Hotel. Location is perfect. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The coffeee machines on each floor were a nice touch and much appreciated in the morning.
291,1913,Nov 10 2005	Go here for fun.	Fantastic place. Great service and great location.
292,1913,"Nov 10 2005	SoHo Grand - Seduction Package	Just returned from a 3 night short break in the Big Apple. The SoHo Grand provided a fantastic, funky base for our stay.The hotel is well positioned in West Broadway close to some great spots to eat out and shop! The ambience of the hotel and the staff combine to provide a hip but professional feel. The cocktail bar particularly hit the spot.The weekend seduction package was great value and the extra detail was appreciated by us."
293,1913,"Nov 9 2005	Great location!	The hotel was above average with its ammenities. However, the location is excellent!"
294,1913,"Nov 8 2005	Great location	Great location. Easy access to Subways. Quick cab ride to central Manhatten. Fantastic restaurants within walkin distance. Wonderful beds, cool bar."
295,1913,"Nov 7 2005	Anniversary	The Soho Grand Hotel is terrific. The service is great and the location is perfect for this end of town. Especially appreciate the staff's attention to the guests. We stopped by early to drop off our bag before check in and were told we could check in to the room then if we wanted. Nice touch. Also, breakfast on Sunday was as delicious as it was comfortable."
296,1913,"Nov 7 2005	Great as usual	Whenever we stay in NYC it is at the Soho Grand. We have never been disappointed. Service, location, decor are all great."
297,1913,"Nov 3 2005	Great choice	I just went to the Soho Grand along with my girlfriend and found it great, despite previous comments I read here. The staff is friendly and helpful (they open doors when you walk in, they take your luggage, but, most of all... they are prompt and fast!), the hotel design is very good and reminds you of the &quot;old NY&quot; (it's not one of those so-called minimal-chic like W, hotels that seems old after a couple of years...).Rooms are good although pretty small, like everywhere in the city. What really makes a difference is the hotel location and friendly staff, besides the glamour you feel when you are there.I recommend this hotel to all Soho lovers."
298,1913,"Nov 1 2005 	Nothing can compare to the Soho Grand Hotel!!	I have been a regular at the Soho Grand. Recently they renovated some of the rooms and this weekend we stayed in one of them.The staff are wonderful, we stay there so often that they know us by name. Always friendly and very quick with service. Its within walking distance to all the great shopping , great restaurants and even you can have fun and shop at canal street which is 2 buildings down.Spring Street and even Broadway for great deals.Little Italy and Chinatown within walking distance.The hotel is like home to us. I have stayed at other hotels in NYC but nothing compares to The Soho Grand. Its very trendy looking but does not have the feeling.Nothing 'uppity&quot; about them.You will probably run into a celebrity or two while your there, we always do and you know what, even they are friendly and warm.My 12 year old daughter had a crush on one celebrity who was staying there and he spent the night talking to her and really made her day!!!I hate to leave everytime I go."
299,1913,"Oct 30 2005	Soho Grand is Grand	The Soho Grand is grand is every way. They cover every little detail so that you feel that someone actually cares! The corner king view is the best. Pillows, blankets...total comfort!Since we travel alot we see a lot of shotty hotels passing themselves off as 4-5 star hotels. NOT the Soho Grand. They are truly GRAND in a very good way.Thanks!"
300,1913,"Oct 21 2005	Do not waste your money	The minute you walk into this hotel you know you are in for problems. the 4 doormen outside basically doing nothing, they do not open the doors nor do they get you taxis. I'm not sure why they are there as they are not even eye candy like in other trendy hotels. They do mention that the check in desk is on the second floor but of course offer no help with your luggage. We arrived after 3pm and they told us our room was not ready. Offered no apologies. Just told us to wait until the room was ready. Enough has been said about the rooms on this site, tiny and with no character, I guess they spent all the money on the lobby which is not even that nice.  We stayed in this hotel because the Mercer was booked on sat night but we had reservations for sunday and monday. the next morning we fled to the Mercer. Everything there was perfect. Attentive doormen, our room was ready at 10AM, the concierge was very nice and the room was beautiful, and larger than those at the Soho Grand for the same price. It was like the difference between flying in coach and then going to first class, thats how I would describe the entire experience. Quality/price the Soho Grand is a complete rip-off. Stay at the Mercer if you want to stay in Soho."
301,1913,Oct 18 2005	Emperor's New Clothes	Is the Soho Grand an example of Emperor's New Clothes? People were telling me this is a great place to stay. Well - it is trendy; and at nearly $500 a night it is certainly exclusive. But why on earth do people stay here? The staff are snooty; the room was so small my wife and I kept falling over each; there was no proper wardrobe and very little storage space anywhere else; and the decor was dingy and depressing We complained about the size of the room. They didn't seem that interested but there was a solution - we could pay another $60 for a bigger one. We chose an alternative strategy - we'd booked for 4 nights but checked out after 1.
302,1913,"Oct 17 2005	Perfect Seduction Weekend	We recently stayed overnight at the Soho Grand with the New York Seduction Special. We were welcomed with a glass of champagne, had early check-in to our room (which was upgraded to a corner room without our asking), had complimentary cocktails before dinner, an excellent full breakfast in our room the following morning, and late (4 PM) check-out the next day. All that for $414 in one of the liveliest quarters of New York City!!!!!!!!! We can't wait to do it again. And neither can our Maltese Pup who has never had a warmer welcome in a hotel!!!!!!!!!"
303,1913,Oct 16 2005 	Great ambiance - Rooms could use some help	I recently spent 2 nights here and loved the staff and ambiance of the hotel. The atmosphere at both bars was very cool and you can't beat the location of the hotel. The coffee machines on each floor were a godsend. The only downfall were the rooms. The cover on my bed had a couple of moth eaten holes and the overall room did not live up to the price as the rest of the hotel did. I'd stay there again only this time ask for a room with better sheets!
304,1913,"Oct 10 2005	A fabulous weekend at the Soho Grand Hotel NYC	My husband &amp; I truly enjoyed our recent trip to NYC. Staying at the Soho Grand Hotel was the foundation of the entire getaway. Every aspect of our experience there was very impressive. From the rooms themselves, to the location, to the hotel lounge, and through the service of each &amp; every employee that we encountered, it was phenomenal. The Soho Grand Hotel offers a wonderful environent for an adult weekend getaway. We hightly recommend it to all couples out there!"
305,1913,"Oct 9 2005	Loved the Soho Grand	I have just returned from a stay at the Soho Grand Hotel in NYC located in the very posh Soho district of NYC. The registration staff person was wonderful as were all the staff I interacted with. The bed was very comfortable (which is very important to me) with nice, fresh modern decor and I had a fabulous view of the city from my window. The internet connection was great to have which I believe was included. While the room wasn't huge (but it was fine by NY standards) and not inexpensive, the location was PERFECT!, right in the heart of tons of excellent restaurants, cafes, high end stores all within easy walking distance and some just a few steps away. The hotel was also convenient to easy public transport if you want to get uptown to the MOMA in a flash. I'm pretty picky and this met all my expectations. I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit New York -L. Saul, San Francisco"
306,1913,"Oct 2 2005 	First choice in hotels when traveling to NY.	I travel to NY at least 6-8 times a year and THE SOHO GRAND has become my first choice in hotels. THe staff is great. love the location, easy to get around, even if you have to go uptown once in a while! Rooms are spacious, cool bar, great food in the restaurant. Highly recommend this hotel!!!"
307,1913,Sep 20 2005	feel like a rock star at Soho Grand	You will feel like a rock star when you stay at the Soho Grand....or we did anyway. It's so nice to stay in a place where they really &quot;get it&quot; regarding service. Walk out the front door and your in Soho for goodness sake. How cool is that? The bar is open late which is pretty cool if you want to have a end of the night drink and talk about how awesome NYC is!Stay here!!!
308,1913,"Sep 20 2005	how about a one star hotel?	This place is no where near a four star hotel. It provides nothing unless the thing that matters most to you is your 'hip' image. Hip replaces service, quality and a decent room. Hip gives you a big fat stain on the carpet...and 'cool' means the bathroom has a broken fan and an air conditiioner that rattles and pings all night long interrupting your attempts to sleep on a brick of a bed. I was so thrilled to be soho grand hip at the end of each evening while I rode the elevator from our room to the front desk four (4!) different times to wait in line to for a room key that never worked for than once or twice. The hippest part of all came when we ordered a meal before a broadway show in the restaurant....that just never came. We begged for some bread but alas that didn't even show so we feasted on the oh so hip apples that are free in the lobby. (You get what you pay for with the apples) I'm sure the wait staff were too busy looking in the mirror to worry about our food,...or maybe they were preoccupied with the cheap vanilla products they give sparingly away in your room. If you want a decent place, this is NOT it. If you want a place that helps you be 'hip' and 'cool', waste your money.You are exactly who they designed this place to accomodate. How much is hip worth to you?"
309,1913,"Sep 18 2005 	Soho Grand Hotel - Never again!!!	We were shocked at the room we had. For $556.00, we got a dirty room with a dirty bathroom. No joke. I realize its an old building but for the money do not expect it to be falling apart. Save yourselves the trouble of finding another hotel and moving as we had to do. Needless to say, we learned our lesson and will not stay at the Soho Grand again."
310,1913,"Sep 13 2005	I'm a regular at the Soho Grand	I stay at the Soho Grand about once a month when I'm in the City for business. It's the only place I've stayed since I discovered it 7 years ago. I like its understated elegance, helpful staff, great (room service) food and it's cool, without trying too hard. I work in the art business, so location is important. It's close to Chelsea, the Village, and walking distance to Little Italy and Chinatown for adventurous dining. Great beauty salon next door (Prive)! The rooms are small and intimate and some have dynamite views. However, I hope that none of you chooses to book at the Grand since it's getting more difficult to get a room there!"
311,1913,"Sep 9 2005	Not what I expected - brilliant pet gimmick!!	I stayed here with my husband on our honeymoon for 3 nights. I was very dissapointed with this hotel however my husband loved it.The bathroom felt very hospital and so basic, but the freebie products were fabulous! The best I've seen.The location was a walk away from all the great treats, shops and restaurants. The subway is only round the corner, so the location was great for getting to Times Square etc...The staff were 'okay'. They were not rude, but they weren't pleasant. They were helpful and answered all of our questions about what to do and where to go.As I said my husand loved this hotel, I expect more luxury in a 4 star hotel and this felt very hospial ward to me.The best thing about this hotel was the pet fish I was given to look after throughout my stay!"
312,1913,"Sep 8 2005	Soho Grand is OhSo Grand!	From start to finish, this was a great experience. This hotel is the embodiment of &quot;cool&quot; and they do it with total &quot;warmth&quot;! We are a couple in our late 40's and brought our 15-year-old daughter with us, and it was great for all. The staff was helpful and totally accomodating in every way. We really felt like we were someplace special. The room, which which was a recently renovated corner king, was immaculate and comfortable. The plasma TV pleased my daughter immensely and the view was great. I especially loved the coffee machine on every floor -- just press a button and you had a cup of whatever strength you preferred, including hot chocolate.We spend some time in the outdoor restaurant and enjoyed the excellent burgers and salads. Very relaxing atmosphere.The location of the Soho Grand is fantastic. There is a true neighborhood feel, and it's fun to stroll down the street and look in the shops and stop for a bite. My husband and I like to jog, so we took advantage of the proximity to the river area and had beautiful runs with the Statue of Liberty looming in the distance. The hotel also has bikes that are provided free of charge and we took our daughter bike riding on the bike paths that are all along the river.A short cab ride and we were in Central Park and also saw a show and visited MOMA. But having stayed on Central Park many times before, we looked forward to getting home to Soho and strolling down the street for ice cream. The Soho Grand will be our only choice when staying in New York in the future."
313,1913,"Sep 6 2005	SoHo Grand is Grand Indeed!	While the room was smaller than I anticipated, its comfort, luxury, and view made up for it in spades. The doormen and front desk staff (especially Karina, who is one of the most fantastic people I've ever met) were disarmingly friendly and helpful--very warm and unpretentious. I have to admit to a bit of disappointment in the concierges, as I felt they were a bit cold in comparison to the other members of the staff and ironically less helpful. However, I don't think that aspect had any negative effect on my stay at all....The positives outweighed the one negative by a longshot. I will definitely stay at the SoHo Grand again!"
314,1913,"Aug 31 2005	Soho Grand grand indeed!	Our wedding night. They greeted us very warmly, gave us complimentary champagne while we checked in and a fruit and cheese basket once we were settled into our room. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. Couldn't have been happier!"
315,1913,"Aug 31 2005	Good to be back.	We admit we strayed and tried some of the new 'Young Pretenders' in NY like the Gansvoort (pretty, but service very very lacking), and the Maritime (rooms way to small), so it was good to go back to The Soho Grand where we have stayed for some years. Some of the rooms may be looking slightly tired around the edges, but the welcome and service is second to none. It was real good to be back."
316,1913,"Aug 24 2005 	Classy hotel nice stay at impressive hotel	Having seen the lobby of the hotel, I wanted to stay at the hotel for so long. I booked a special weekend package and got a very good deal. The service was nice, people are very kind and very helpful. the athmosphere is very stylish and the hotel is calm. It has a soothing effect. My room was very nice although not so extravagant as the lobby. I was hoping for more art deco in the room. The bathroom has a classic design and was nice. The Shower was good which is important to me. And of course, the view. I had a delux grand room, it has a superb view of midtown, empire state, Chrysler, time Square ... And all the water containers of SOHO. I had a great experience and hope you will too."
317,1913,"Aug 23 2005	Location Location Location	The Soho Grand was one of downtown's first truly hip hotels. Taking hints from the architectural history of Soho, the hotel was designed with a certain neo 19th century industrial chic. However, while certainly groundbreaking at the time, the hotel has begun to be passed by newer and more comfortable establishments. The rooms seem plain, drab, and small, and the lobby and bar dark and somewhat pedestrian. Yet, the location is the best! You will be in the heart of the Soho scene directly on West Broadway. If this hotel had better prices, it would be wonderful. However, at the prices they charge, it simply is not worth it."
318,1913,"Aug 22 2005	luv to go back to SGH	Went to New York last week. would like to explore soho area this time. I choose SGH. First, i kind of bit worry because there are negative reviews about this hotel in here. Anyway, I trust myself when choosing this hotel. arrived there. this is what i can share: from the very front doors, The valet parking, and the front desk they are excellent and very efficient. The service is excellent and we luv the in dining menu. All and all, next time we go to new york, we would stay in this hotel."
319,1913,"Aug 22 2005	Soho Grand	Nice hotel in an interesting area... my wife and I went for our anniversary and had a great time. They had a package (I think it is called &quot;Romance in the City&quot; or something like that) where the hotel included decorating the room with flowers and chocolate, drinks at the bar, breakfast and champagne... and of course the views were great from the room (where we spent most of our time). Lots of fun things to do around the area of the hotel, plus they gave you a list of where to go and what to do to help. All in all, a great experience that I recommend."
320,1913,"Aug 22 2005	Wonderful place	I had a wonderful time at the Soho Grand. The room was clean, well appointed, there was a great view. There was a business center so I could check my email. Soho Grand probably had the best room service of any hotel I've been to. If you like Greenwich Village and Soho, you can't beat the location. It's pricey, but it's worth it."
321,1913,"Aug 11 2005 	stay somewhere else!	This hotel stinks. I have stayed here (for business) at least once a year for the past 7 years. In that time The Soho Grand has gone from trendy hot spot to shabby, dirty, overpriced and obnoxious. The service was deplorable (I had to call down to the front desk to enquire about the whereabouts of my luggage 1/2 hour after checking in. They asked me what it looked like, and then it still took another 1/2 hour for them to bring it begrudgingly to my room). The furniture was threadbare and stained, there were hairs in the sink, the air conditioner was very loud, corn flakes cost $13 a bowl. I don't expect friendly service in New York hotels but at least professional would be nice. I hope this hotel goes out of business soon so that a new and better hotel can open."
322,1913,"Aug 10 2005 	AMAZING! I cannot wait to return....	I travel all around for business and I am extremely picky, but this hotel did it all right! From the very helpful doorman who took my bags from the door straight to my room (being a grand guest, I had be pre-registered) to the concierge who helped me with clubs and restaurants. The renovated room was clean and designed beautifully. It was just an incredible stay all around...and will be my home in NY!"
323,1913,"Aug 9 2005	My new favorite home away from home	I stayed at the Soho Grand for the first time last week and it was excellent. From the front desk lady to the hotel food, the service and quality were outstanding. I am making this hotel my new home away from home for all my New York visits to come!!"
324,1913,"Aug 8 2005	Not Grand at all...except for the price you pay	I was recently in NY for a couple of days and stayed at the Soho Grand for one night (as opposed to my planned 5 nights). I was actually enchanted at arrival: amazing deco in the lobby, jazz and laughs at the bar and I was sipping champagne while checking in...how wonderful!I was less smiley when I saw how small my $300-a night room was but yet again room size was never a selling point for the Grand. And the mini bar was filled with chocolates and nuts from all over the world and chic of the chicest Fiji water...My enchantment really vanished after the first night: was it the constant noise from the central air con ventilators, the $100 I paid for breakfast (consisting of miserable eggs and toasts and not so good pancakes), or the bathroom so tiny that you could not close the door if there was more than one person in it?All I know is I checked out as soon as possible the day after, checked into the Sofitel Hotel midtown (really great one btw) and made great use of the tube and (cheap) cabs to go downtown."
325,1913,"Aug 2 2005	4 stars???? Are you kidding	Let me start by stating that I have stayed in many hotels in Manhattan over the years, and that I will not be getting into small room issues, as that is just Manhattan. Below is a list of my complaints:1) Dirty bathrooms2) Bad Air Conditioning3) Losing a fax not once, but twice4) Forgetting to tell us there was a package delivery of a basket from friends until we checked out.5) Uncomfortable bed6) Bedside light did not work7) It took 3 phone calls and over an hour to get an iron8) The tv was small and didn't work right9) Our room had a lovely view of an outdoor bar that was hopping until 3 am, and we had to turn on the loud air conditioner to drown out the noise10) I appreciated the drunk high school kids going to their penthouse party on the top floor of the hotel with a joint in their ear -- you are a hotel, not a club11) All this cost $300 a nightIn all honesty, if you are trying to look cool and be in a past-its-prime Manhattan party atmosphere of trying-to-be-hip tourists and high school kids, than this is the place for you.The Soho Grand is an outdated, sorely in need of a makeover botique 3-star Manhattan hotel that somehow has a 4 star rating. I feel like I paid $150 a night for their taste in CDs in the room, and that was it. Save your money and stay somewhere else in Manhattan"
326,1913,"Aug 1 2005 	Excellent -- and I'm really *really* picky!	This is by far the best hotel I've stayed at in a while. THE BEST part is that each room has *individual AC units* -- not just individual thermostats! So you could totally control the temp inside the room. Which, because it was 98 degrees outside with a TON of humidity -- that came in handy. It's rare at luxury hotels to find something as simple as Air Control. Usually large hotels have a central air system that's set at 72 or something. So it's impossible to get cool (if you like cooler temps when you sleep). The Soho Grand was SO great in this regard. The rooms were cold and wonderful!The one bad thing is that we booked a King bed thinking it was a King-sized bed. But it isn't. It's a European-King. Euro-Kings are MUCH smaller than American Kings. I'd say they are halfway between a Queen and a King. Anyone 5'10&quot; and taller won't fit on the bed. Had the AC not been so great, it would've been miserable. But because we could keep it cool, I was able to survive the NON-King, King bed.Another great thing is the coffee machine/device in the hall. Very good. Especially if you have a room directly across from one. We were in 629 -- and I think it was $309 a night. Overall it was a great room!Because it's within walking distance to all of Soho, we never bothered to eat at the hotel, so I'm not sure if the food or service was good. We did try a &quot;Mexican Tier&quot; snack which we thought tasted GROSS. But that's what we get for eating in the hotel when there's world-class cuisine right out the front door. There's an Italian place diagonally from the hotel that is AMAZING. And, Barolo down the street is awesome.Also within walking distance was VESUVIO bakery which has a killer Neopolitan Egg sandwich for breakfast/brunch which is GREAT.We stayed here a week and really loved it. We were in town for a film festival. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Best price for the style and location in all the city!Oh, another bad thing -- we asked for a free goldfish to be placed in our room and we never got one. Apparently you can get one if you ask. So don't let them forget! That would've been fun!"
327,1913,"Jul 22 2005	'Trendy' it is 'wonderful' it is not.	My husband and I went to NYC to celebrate our 11th anniversary. We decided Soho would be a fun spot with Greenwich Village and Tribeca being within walking distance. I did read a lot of negativity on this website about the Soho Grand, but thought if we paid for one of their upscale rooms, it would still be a pleasant experience.I requested a north-facing room so we could see the Empire State Building, as high up as possible. We got an east-facing room (nothing view-wise) on the 14th floor (16th is the penthouse suites). When I made the reservation, the person in reservations was trying very hard to sell me on their weekend package, saying, &quot;You might as well do it because it doesn't cost you anything extra. You get 2 free drink coupons, champagne upon arrival, 2 free breakfast coupons, early check-in and late check-out.&quot; I don't understand why the big sell...we had to practically beg to get these things. They have certain times they give the champagne, and we arrived too late for it. When they gave us our room keys upon check-in, there was no drink coupons or breakfast coupons in our arrival envelope. We arrived too late for the early check-in and we would be checking out late to catch our flight, so we couldn't benefit from that either.When we entered our room, it absolutely wreaked of stale cigarette smoke. It was late when we got there, so we decided to stay in the room and have them move us in the morning. I called the front desk first thing in the morning to complain, and they said they'd call me right back. It was that evening before they called back to tell us they didn't have any other non-smoking rooms at the room level we wanted, but they'd be happy to move us down a few floors to their least expensive (SMALL!) room. (After reading how ultra-small the rooms were, we reserved a larger room--which was quite suitable in size for 2 people. We kept the room because of the size, but in hindsight, should have moved. The smoke smell gave me a dull headache every morning and all my clothes wreaked of cigarette smoke.)We stayed 3 nights, and by 11pm on the 2nd night, we still had not received anything that came in the &quot;package&quot; I bought. I called the front desk to vent the fact our room stunk so badly and that we still had not received our freebies, plus we didn't get a turn-down service that night. The front desk manager said, &quot;Oh, we don't do turn-down service unless you request it.&quot; I couldn't believe my ears. For the price we paid, it didn't include turn-down service? When I complained of not receiving any of the things from our package, she said, &quot;Yes, I see. You have a very valid complaint. I'm sorry your room stinks, but we turned that whole floor into a non-smoking floor and didn't give it time to air out. You're not the first person to complain.&quot;Okay, at this point, I'm furious because she's not offering any solutions until I asked her directly, &quot;So what are you going to do about all these problems?&quot; She had everything from our &quot;package&quot; delivered to our room 15 minutes later. She offered to spray our room with something to disguise the smell, but I declined the offer fearing we'd be smelling floral mixed with stale smoke.The only thing this hotel has going for it is location. During our 3-night stay, we never saw any employees that looked like they were over 35 years old. This was odd to us. All the doormen, front desk employees, waiters, waitresses, they all were very young--early 20's to mid-30's. I felt like these employees did not have the years of experience to know how to treat their guests. They were all a little aloof. (No, I didn't chalk it up as &quot;NYC attitude,&quot; I chalked it up to poor training.) Just off the front desk is their lounge. It was a comfortable place to sit for a drink, but they kept loud synthesized music going non-stop from the afternoon through the night. I guess at 45 years old, I'm too old to appreciate canned, synthesized music. It seemed like a desperate attempt to be &quot;hip.&quot; I'm interested in knowing who their client base is, because I can't see the young &quot;hip&quot; 20-ish people who were hanging out in the bar actually spending $500/night for a room. Apparently, the hotel is trying to appeal to that age group.During our weekend, my husband and I popped into a few hotels to check them out for future reference. For what we paid at the Soho Grand, we could get a room at the Peninsula Hotel, which is probably where we'll stay next time. That hotel has class."
328,1913,"Jul 13 2005 	The SoHI Grand	It's a beatiful building. The design and decorations are great. But it's not grand. It's barely SOHO.I was there for business. The service was well above average. They did what they could to accomodate my needs at all times. I liked the bar a lot. There was also a small gym that I usually had all to myself.So what's the problem? It's just not a good value. I thought the interesting parts of SOHO were a decent walk away. And the room was so small. Soooo small. No iron. And the bathroom, while clean, was dated. I did, however, love the bath products. You can't beat Bliss. Steal a few bars of this extra-expensive soap. It's a small consolation for the price you'll pay for having to live in a small child's room. The bed was very comfortable. The room could have used more light, but the sun spilled in from where I was so I had more than the average guest.The internet access was also a little expensive. It cost extra (pretty normal) but the speed left something to be desired.It's a room. Not a place to invite your friends back to, but rather a small bedroom with little more than big windows and great soap. You pay for the wait staff, the location (supposedly), and the &quot;Grand&quot; brand name, but in the end, you're better off at a chain than because it'll cost even the slightly claustrophobic a little piece of their sanity."
329,1913,"Jul 8 2005	Not worth the money	After a really nice experience prior to our stay (concierge booked us tickets and sent a very nice mail about it) we were truly disappointed of the actual stay. Tiny room, unfriendly and unhelpful front desk. We had asked for a two bed room and got a room with a one small bed. When I asked to change to a room with two beds the front desk staff first said they were fully booked and then felt inclined to say, they don't have any rooms with two beds anyway and hung up the phone without waiting for an answer. We will not stay there again because the combination of a small room and this kind of staff attitude is available at much lower prices in Manhatten."
330,1913,"Jul 7 2005	Never stay here ... shame	Where to start. I have stayed at this hotel 3 times now, and 3rd time was not lucky. This was one of the worst hotel experiences I have had, and I travel extensively. There is no value to be had here.To start with the room is the size of a mini match box, and dimly lit with a desk not big enough even for the smallest laptop. It didn't seem that clean. The bathroom was tiny, and when you are staying somewhere for 2 weeks, size matters. There was no closet space to hang any clothes.The staff seemed to forget who the guest was. There was so much attitude that you were left just shaking your head. I'm still astounded to this day. Things that were to be delivered to my room kept getting sent to the wrong room (this happened on several occasions). The bill was incorrect.Over the weekend, the noise was unbearable, and there appeared to be teenagers or hoods or something running up and down the corridors all night (this is not an exaggeration). Staff did nothing when I complained at 3, 4, 5am etc. Luckily I didn't hear the music from the bar (which was good music by the way ... although not all night), as I was on a high floor. The rooms are so small, that the slighest sound in the corridor can be heard.The location of the hotel is fantastic for Soho ... but hey ... take a taxi / car. It is not worth staying in this dump filled with attitude. It has definitely lost the &quot;it&quot; factor that it somehow claimed to have."
331,1913,"Jul 1 2005	Nice foyer shame about the room	I wanted to believe in this hotel because I love the Soho area of New York but in the end, I felt a little short changed. The entrance and foyer was great - modern, cutting edge. But the room was jaw droppingly small, clothes storage was behind a beaded curtain and tiny and service was chaotic. Our room was left open for a day by the cleaners. The mega-trendy staff are what you want looks-wise in this hip part of Manhattan but completely flakey. Ask for something and don't expect to receive. Breakfast was ludicrously expensive and a Tex-Mex cake tray consisting of a few Doritos and sauces at thirty dollars was daylight robbery - and took an epoch to arrive. Frankly, pay a bit more and stay at the Mercer. I'm sorry because my hopes were high. Really, really disappointed."
332,1913,"Jun 23 2005	perfect getaway	If you are looking for a great getaway in the city that has it all the Soho Grand is the place for you. Not only are the rooms spacious and very appealing, the staff is simply marvelous. From the time you step through the doors in to the sheek lobby you are treated like a member of a very exclusive club. The hotel offers every service imaginable and are ready and willing to make every detail of your stay perfect. They offer services for all ages and even welcome and pamper your pets! Located in a fantastic neighborhood full of restaurants , Galleries and shopping you could literally spend a week in a 5 block radius."
333,1913,"Jun 13 2005	Nice but not amazing	Great location, and a nice hotel. Worth $380 a night? Probably not. The rooms were small, the bed ( supposedly a queen but definitely a few inches short) was small. Fun location, great lounge to people-watch. Very clean. We liked it, but it was too small and expensive for what we got. Next time we will try another hotel in the same location- maybe 60 Thompson."
334,1913,"Jun 8 2005	Gorgeous with a few flaws	I love love love this hotel - mostly. The decor is fabulous - every hotel now does the hip-hotel-vibe-thing, but the SoHo Grand does it in its own individual way. My room was small, but then they always are in New York, and functioned well. The only thing I would say is, why oh why do they still have blankets on the bed? In this day and age! It's 2005 not 1955, and even my grandparents have a duvet these days. It's incredible for such a trendy hotel. The only other issue I have with the SoHo Grand is that it doesn't have enough capacity at check-in or the bar at busy periods. Overall, unless you're a tourist, SoHo is a far better place to be than midtown or uptown. I've also stayed in 60 Thompson, and I would have to say that the SoHo Grand just beats it."
335,1913,"May 27 2005	Great Property and Staff	I've stayed at a number of hotels in different parts of Manhattan, and I have to say that the Soho Grand is one of my favorites. First off, I need to disclose that I booked the hotel through an online service about two weeks before our visit (May 13-16), and got a Grand King room for what I considered to be a great deal. I'd never stayed at the Soho Grand, and I was a bit skeptical after reading some recent reviews, but I was intrigued and wanted to stay in SoHo.Check-in: We arrived at 10:00 a.m. and were greeted by a friendly bellman who took our luggage and directed us to the second floor lobby, where we were met by a smiling, enthusiastic front desk staff - nothing like I had expected after reading some of the previous reviews. I was ready for &quot;attitude.&quot; We even joked around a little about that! Since check-in time isn't until 3:00 p.m., they were happy to keep our luggage, and upon returning later that afternoon, the formal check-in was quick and again friendly, and we were offered a glass of champagne - a nice touch. Once we got into the room, our luggage arrived within 20 minutes.The Hotel: Very clean and modern, and as some have described it, &quot;industrial chic.&quot; It's not elegant, but really cool and, I suppose, &quot;trendy,&quot; but the people staying there looked pretty down to earth to me, although I didn't see a lot of typical tourists or families, which is a big plus in my book. This isn't a hotel for families wanting to do the typical New York thing.The Room: Many reviewers have commented on the size of the rooms, but our room was no smaller than any other room I've stayed in in New York (I've stayed in much smaller). There was plenty of room to move about comfortably for two people. True, there are no drawers to put your clothes in, but when I travel I never really unpack anyway - I just live out of my suitcase, so that wasn't a problem for me. There was a space to hang clothes, which was good. We returned from a late night in the neighborhood on Saturday night, and the bar area was cranking, but we weren't bothered by any noise (we were on the 5th floor).The Bathroom: Great water pressure. Shower drained just fine. Plenty of towels. Very clean.Restaurant/Bar: We didn't use either, so I can't comment.Location: As others have mentioned, the location is excellent. You are within easy walking distance of Chinatown, the Village, and great shops, restaurants, and bars in SoHo. Shout out to the great people at Toad Hall just around the corner on Grand St.!Check-out: The 12:00 check-out time was inconvenient for us, so we asked them if we could check out an hour later, and they said it was no problem. Check-out was easy; you just do it on the TV in your room. Overall: We loved the Soho Grand. The hotel is not without its quirks, but they are so relatively minor that I don't want to mention them here (some other reviewers have covered them). All of the staff that we came in contact with were very friendly and helpful. They dont dote on you, and thats what I like. I'm not sure that I'd pay their regular rates to stay there again, but if I were given a similar deal as I got this time, I'd take it in a heartbeat."
336,1913,May 21 2005	Don't stay here	I am new to trip advisor but our stay at the Soh Grand was so awful I felt I should let others know. I had booked a superior room we were put on the 3rd floor and the room was certainly not large. I would hate to see the basic ones. Breakfast served in the rooms is a bad idea when the rooms are this small even worse when they caanot get the order right and bring the wrong food at the wrong time as it takes forever to correct the mistake. There's a great diner round trhe corner for breakfast. I wouldn't bother with their offering.At weekend the bar is so loud it is impossible to get to sleep in rooms in the lower part of the buiding until the music is turned off. The bar seems to be out of bounds to hotel guests beyond early evening as we we turfed off our table because they had allocated it to someone else.Don't expect to be able to borrow CDs or DVDs as even though they claim they have these whatever you ask for is on loan to someone ese apparently.The bill for our stay was entirely wrong and had to be corrected line by line.When we complained about all this we were told our room would be upgraded on our next stay.They must be mad if they think we would ever stay here again
337,1913,"May 16 2005	Only if Location is Most Important	If you must, must be in SoHo, and do not require any real value for the money you spend, then SoHo Grand is the hotel for you. Although, if that were truly the case, perhaps the Mercer would be an attractive alternative. Certainly a more elegant one. Attitude is one thing. Ridiculous incompetence, another.For $559 I received: - a &quot;king&quot; size bed. Please note that such bed does not conform to standard &quot;king&quot; size measurements, but as it is a smidgen larger than a queen, it is called a &quot;king&quot;. - a cigarette strewn balcony off the window.- a bathroon with no windows and one not terribly bright light above the mirror.- a shower with the most faint of water pressure. Rinsing soap off, a dubious task.- a non-draining shower- a guest relations representative who put me on hold and never came back.On the flip side, I thought room service was much better than average."
338,1913,"May 3 2005 	The beautiful people	The room was great - very clean and spacious for NYC. The staff and guests are very SoHo... trendy, hip, a bit preening. Close to major subway lines, shopping, restaurants, etc. My only complaint was that the checkout process was a nightmare. Two lines and no movement for more than 20 minutes. Unacceptable for a spendy hotel in the Big Apple."
339,1913,"Apr 28 2005 	Nice rooms - poor service	If you can get a good deal, rooms are clean and nice. Hotel is in a super location in Soho. Just don't use room service or eat in the bar. Service is terrible!"
340,1913,"Apr 22 2005 	Showing its age and still overpriced	The SoHo Grand no longer seems so grand or even merely good. And at around $400 a night, I got a room that was only modest in size, minimal in terms of amenities, and otherwise oddly musty in general atmosphere (there was a faint layer of dust on the packages of chocolates set out above the mini bar--no, not free, just part of the mini bar offerings for purchase). The service, I can't really comment on, since I neither required nor received any services out of the ordinary. I can say, however, that this is the first hotel I've stayed in where I never once saw the hotel staff opening the lobby doors for its guests.Unless a you're a tourist who absolutely needs to be steps away from the commercial district of SoHo (which, by the way, has become really downmarket and icky in places), go elsewhere. Even if you are, you may want to venture beyond this immediate neighborhood, which on weekends becomes a mob scene, what with hordes of people from NJ flooding the sidewalks so there's barely any room to walk on.I would recommend trying some of the hotels now newly renovated or opened on the Upper West Side, which is much closer to what real NY is like. The prices are about half what you'd pay here for everything and things are just more civilized."
341,1913,"Apr 11 2005	Terrific and roomy!	I have stayed in many hotels in New York: mostly Schragers. They are all so small (though most well appointed) and they really are snooty.We stayed at the SoHo Grand in a corner room - the romantic package - We got to check in at noon, and check out the next day at 4pm. The room was spotless, and the room service prompt and delicious. Not to mention the great bar.They were so nice, I thought I was in another city! It was one of the best stays we ever had!"
342,1913,"Apr 7 2005	A Room So Small I Had To go To The Hall To Change My Mind	Okay, it's an old joke &quot;so small the cockroaches were hunchbacked&quot; but in the case of this place it's accurate reporting. The staff was very courteous and the neighborhood is ultra cool, but when did tiny, minscule rooms become acceptable and groovy to the hotel going public? They keep the lights in the rooms very dim I guess we're not suppose to notice that you have been confined to a cell and a very small one at that. Plus it's not cheap! Expensive and cramped, if that's your style stay at The Soho Grand-the name is bigger then the rooms-the reason they provide you with a goldfish is to make you feel better about your own surroundings. &quot;Look the poor fish is in that tiny bowl and I have over 77 square feet !&quot;"
343,1913,"Mar 30 2005 	Not-so Grand...	Positives:- Goldfish in the room. How cool is that?- Conceirge gave us a great recommendation for dinner at Besitos.- Most staff was nice (although not very friendly)- Oscar was helpful at the front deskNegatives:- Lack of technological knowledge of staff...- Waitstaff (except for one guy) were clueless and horrible. I barely was given the time of day.- General attitude was poor or at least un-caring (I'm not a fashion hipster)- Any other time we dealt with the conceirge (except for above) was poor - either no one available, or not efficient.- Automatic 20% gratutity added to breakfast bill - wouldn't have been a problem if the staff was even worth close to that.Overall, it was an ok experience. I would have rather seen them spend time training/hiring employees with a sense of customer service (regardless of the Soho location). I don't care where I am - I want to be treated like a guest and not an inconvenience."
344,1913,"Mar 16 2005	Enjoyed the grand - great location!	My fiancee and I stayed at the SOHO grand from 9-13 of March 2005 and really enjoyed our stay. We read the mixed reviews on this site prior to booking, but made the decision to stay there anyway - and we were not disappointed. It's one of those hotels you either love or hate: with a real industrial chic feel - it's not for eveyone. Our room (a superior queen) was nice with fab toiletries, and we had no problems with the hotel staff, who were all pretty friendly. (If you want staff who are tripping over themselves to help you, then maybe you should try the Waldorf!). This place is for the young and young at heart and the conservative traditional type who their want every whim tended to. It's full of trendy people (albeit sometimes a little pretentious and noisy), but we had a blast. You can even have a fish for company during your stay. And we saw Ben Stiller (he's tiny!&quot;)We spent very little time there and so for that reason only (and maybe the fact that I'd have liked black out blinds in the room), should we have considered staying somewhere cheaper. Soho itself is great - downtown Manhattan at its best, with endless boutiques, coffee bars, delis, restaurants etc to choose from. You need at least a week to get through them all! It's also spitting distance from other hip neighbourhoods like Tribeca, and Greenwich Village. Thumbs up for the SOHO grand. Would definitely return again and again!"
345,1913,"Mar 16 2005 	Location - Location - Location	Just spent five days in New York - business and pleasure - and loved staying at the Soho Grand. The location is perfect - all downtown is within walking distance. The Service was excellent - especially the Concierge, who managed everything (dinner-rescheduling, car-renting...) within minutes. The setting is beautiful and modern (but too posh-stylish - I don't want to get into a Helmut Lang-Suit just to have breakfast) Oh, and breakfast is good, but NY-pricy - you absolutely want to go and try the charming &quot;Le pain quotidien&quot; for breakfast, just a two minutes-walk away on Grand Street (at Mercer)...as always: it's all about location and here, you're in the middle of it all!"
346,1913,"Mar 14 2005	Classic and Modern beauty	We had a lovely stay at the Soho Grand, and this is from people who live in New York already (fabulous Brooklyn), so we are picky! Very attentive staff, incredible aesthetic and style of the entire space, quite unique, great complimentary apples (!) and NY Times, million-dollar views from high floors, all in a great neighborhood far from the insane confines of Times Square. This is a piece of true, downtown NYC. Do yourself a favor and have breakfast in the lounge, eating croissants and drinking Lattes while sinking into comfortable couches. Complimentary docking stations for ipods!! Totally awesome."
347,1913,"Mar 13 2005	Service needs an overhaul!	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Soho Grand for one night. The service is HORRIBLE. When we checked in the room was not ready, so we decided to go and have lunch at one of the restaurants in the area. We arrive back at the hotel, and our room is finally ready. We checked our bags with the bell hop, and they said they would send them up immediately. It took two and a half hours for our bags to arrive. We spoke to the manager Osacar and he said he would get right on it. After three phone calls the bags finally arrived. Room service was average. We had drinks in the lobby bar and the waitress was extreamly rude. The service at this hotel really needs improvement. The room itself is a little small for my liking. I wouldn't stay at the Soho Grand in the future. Choose another hotel."
348,1913,"Mar 12 2005 	Don't stay here.	Positives: option to have gold fish in your room [like Kimpton Hotels ie Hotel Monacos]; good view here on the 15th floor; fun barNegatives: cannot unpack as there are no drawers and no luggage rack!, very small room, Bad service, no phone on desk, modem was not hooked up properly - no one knows anything about the computer system; poor temperature controlIn general: NYC often has small hotel rooms, but this is ridiculous - I can't unpack [and only have a carryon for 2 nights], I forgot my contact solution and they had none and knew of no convenience store that would carry it [hello, am I not in NYC?]; I would not stay here either for business or pleasure. There seems to be an attempt at an Attitude or Edge by the staff- however the whole experience falls short. I was very disappointed particularly after seeing the website which portrays this as 'grand'. I would say this is a grand disappointment."
349,1913,Feb 26 2005	Do yourself a favor...stay somewhere else	Service is nonexistent and the rooms are very small. The staff was unable to do simple tasks like bring pillows or provide the items offered on the menu. The coffee they have outside the guest rooms was very good but not worth the lack of hospitality.
350,1913,"Feb 23 2005	Location Location Location!	My family and I stayed at the Soho Grand Hotel over President's Day Weekend. If you want Soho, steps from art galleries, great boutique shopping while staying at a very safe and very accommodating hotel that's very chic and cool? Stay at the Soho Grand. Your kids will love the goldfish and you will love the complimentary glass of champagne at check-in. Now that's how everyone should start a holiday weekend!"
