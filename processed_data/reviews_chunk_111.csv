19,2293,Jul 14 2005	A treat!	Travelling as a single mom with children is not always easy. At most more exclusive hotels
20,2293,May 22 2005	What a nice surprise!	We just returned from a 14 day China tour and the best hotel was the Radisson Plaza Shanghai! The hotel is located in the beautiful Frenchtown section of Shanghai. Although you need to take a cab to most restaurants or shopping districts
21,2293,Apr 2 2005 	Best kept secret in Shanghai	This hotel is great
22,2293,May 24 2009	???????????????????????????		
1,2295,Great weekend!	We spent a delightful time in the Presidential Suite and I recommend this hotel highly as the service is excellent and the General Manager and his lovely wife are very charming hosts!
2,2295,"Nov 15 2009 	Superb Hotel	We never expected Ramada to be so luxurious. We were ther 3 nights for business and were very impressed.The staff was amazing friendly and helpful, i had never seen such an extended breakfast. The Hotel is not the most modern hotel I have seen but they make up for it with their friendly staff and services. The room is very comfortable, big TV with CNN, HBO, AXn and other western movie channels and what I always find important is a spacious and clean bathroom.If you want to stay in Pudong the hotel is definitely worth the room rate."
3,2295,"Nov 1 2009 	An example of excellence!!	L.s.I travelled with a partner / colleague of mine to Hong Kong and later to Shanghai and we were both surprisingly treated with one of the best hotel services we experienced since a long time in the Ramada Plaza Pudong. The hotel staff went all the way in their efforts to make our stay a pleasant and comfortable one. Their attention to detail was extreme and we can only recommend this hotel to everyone visiting this region of China, as a business visitor or as a tourist. Thank you Ramada Plaza Pudong Shanghai."
4,2295,"Sep 21 2009 	Smelly rooms noisy elevators got back home sick...	Typical Chinese business hotel, but business only. Room was smelly, no decent western television, elevators were very noisy and on my way back home I already had to take some asperine in the plane because of having become sick. Staff are ok, but nothing more than that. Food was good, but hey - where isn't food good in China? The location is ok, but if you pay just a little bit more a stay at the Pudong Renaissance a bit down the road is well worth the extra RMBs!"
5,2295,"Sep 16 2009 	everything I expected	This was my first stay in the Ramada Plaza Pudong. It is everything you expect as a business traveller. Reasonable close to the ariport, good, clean rooms, enough fitness/relax possibilities, friendly people.. Price/quality is also ok. I will certainly return.Jan Verschroeven, Maasmechelen, Belgium"
6,2295,"Sep 7 2009 	not worth the room rate	We were there last week for business and we stayed Monday-Friday, prime reason we picked this hotel was because it was near to our customer's factory, and it was the only reason that kept us there, By Friday afternoon we couldn't wait to get out quick enough... the place was dated and furnitures old and tired, the bed was so hard we had back pain after the first night, the water that came out of the bathroom tap had an awful odor, and for me what was unforgivable was that they had no hot water - imagine a luke warm bath or shower after a long hard working day... We will not return there again next time we visit our customer, we could have paid cheaper to stay elsewhere. Staff attitude was OK, but couldn't make up for the unpleasant stay."
7,2295,"Jul 27 2009 	Catch the pulse of Shanghai	If u wana be in the city centre, in sync with the beat..this is a nice place to stay, just dont go there looking for tranquility."
8,2295,"Jun 15 2009 	Stay here if location is right for your business seek alternate location for pleasure	I stayed here for 4 nights with my wife in May. She was traveling for business while I went along with her for pleasure. We extended her business trip into a vacation to Vietnam. This hotel was recommended by her employer's Shanghai office since it was across the street. I would recommend this hotel for business but not for pleasure. We were put on the executive floor with an &quot;executive lounge&quot; serving overpriced beverages and snacks. For my pleasure side of life, I had to take a cab to get to the subway so that I could then get around the city to more interesting places. The life around this hotel feels oddly suburban, as it is surrounded by a western type business park full of western companies, apartment towers. If you stay here and your company is not paying, buy your water and beer at the Family Mart down the street where it costs 10% of what it does in the hotel.This hotel location does have a few western places to eat nearby, but there are some more interesting places in Shanghai. We actually stayed 1 additional night in Shanghai during a 22 hour layover at the end of our trip. This time we stayed at the Pudong Courtyard Marriott and it was a much nicer room, slightly more interesting street life, and for a comparable weekday rate, it was 20-30% less money this this Ramada."
9,2295,Jun 10 2009 	END OF THE TRIP	this hotel is really very good with a lot of comfort.It was the end of my trip in China and I was pleased by the quality of the room .There is a very good shop for the last shopping
10,2295,"Jun 9 2009 	Great hotels especially for long stay guests	This hotel is located outside the busy, crowded and noisy downtown area. Located in JinQiao an more expat area with lots of restaurants (I counted 40 within 1 mile from the hotel). The area is nice, green and quiet, so more or less the opposite of downtown. Still downtown is not far away, by taxi 10km or go to Science &amp; Technology (/ FakeMarket) (6km) and take the Subway from there.The restaurants of the hotel (1 chinese 1 large 2 openkitchen (Western / Italian &amp; Japanese Restaurant) are great and the breakfast is huge. For breakfast you have a choice between a large western variety or a large asian variety, both are great. Staff is really polite and helpful.The hotel also offers a lot of meeting / business rooms and because it's located in the New Import &amp; Export Business Center, ideal for long stay guests.I would deffinetly recomment this to my friends !!"
11,2295,"Apr 26 2009 	Excellent Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for my business travel to China. Our office is nearer, which is main advantage to select this hotel. This is also not so far from airport (may be 30-45 minutes).Rooms are great and views from the room are also wonderful. Food is good, and services are better. It has nearby an Indian restaurant which solves problem for vegetarian guys like me.Per night it costs about 1000 RMB."
12,2295,"Aug 25 2007 	Your basic business hotel	The hotel provides basic traveler services. The breakfast is actually quite good (and came free with my room). There is a basic gym and decent pool. The staff are reasonably helpful. Unlike others, I don't seem to have had a communication problem.The internet service also came free with my room; however, it was a bit unreliable.The rooms are large and clean &amp; the bed is comfortable (maybe a bit too comfortable!).The biggest down-side for this hotel is that to get to Shanghai you need to take a 20RMB taxi ride of 15-20 minutes--just to get to the metro. If you want a taxi into the PuXi section of Shanghai (where all the tourist stuff is), it takes longer and costs much more. I typically did the metro thing as the metro is fast, clean, safe, and doesn't ask me if I want a &quot;massagee&quot;."
13,2295,"Aug 6 2007 	Value for money questionable	Stayed here for 5 nights whilst on business in Shanghai. Booked into the executive floor &amp; used the Upper Deck Lounge for checking in &amp; out.Upper Deck Lounge totally lacked atmosphere &amp; was very basic. Girls on the desk were pleasant, but not all had great english, causing a level of confusion.Efficient service in the bars, but again both bars seemed to lack atmosphere. The main one appeared to be used just prior to guests heading out for the evening or for a night cap.My bedroom was very spacious, clean &amp; comfortable. No complaints at all in this area. High speed internet access also available in the room.Ate breakfast in the main buffet restaurant daily &amp; found the choice &amp; quality to be very good. Ate lunch there one day too &amp; found the choice and quality to be excellent!Location of the Hotel is fine. Walked to a couple of restaurants from there, which took about 15/20 mins. More on offer further a-field, but those trips would require taxis."
14,2295,"Jan 9 2007 	Distant from city in Pudong area but comfortable expat community area	Stayed here on business trip for 6 months, with my small family of 2. The establishment offers service apartments (back of building) and hotel rooms (front).Check-in was a breeze, some of the front desk staff are good english speaking, while others are a challenge. We stayed in few units throughtout, varying in layout and size. But overall, the size is good enough for a small family starting from 60 sq/m price around USD2000 per month. Kitchen is open concept for 1 or 2 bedroom units. Broadband is free (generally free and easily available in China) and everything else is complete and clean.From the airport, this is about 30 mins drive, as both are in the same new territory of Shanghai ie. Pudong. The city is another 30 mins or so, in the older territory ie. Puxi. There is no train station nearby ie. closest would be at science center about 10 mins drive.Surrounding area is basically an expat community. Mostly are people who wants to escape from the old bustling traffic congestion of Puxi or are working in the new territory (down the road 15 mins walk, there are many factories and industrial parks) or have children studying nearby (plenty of private schools). A walk of 15 mins (opposite end of industrial parks) would reach a shopping center with Carrefour, hair salons, fast foods, food courts, specialty grocery store, spa, fitness club, huge sports shopping franchise (Decathlon), hardware megastore, more more pub/restaurants (japanese, american, italian, vietnamese, of course chinese, etc.). Amenities are aplenty. The weekends would have families hanging out in this very area, next to a park, while sipping Starbucks coffee and dogs running around, football games, rolling on the grass, etc..... bazaars and fairs going on.If tired of nearby surroundings, a short cab ride around Pudong would take no longer than 15 mins to reach huge Pudong parks and other shopping areas (Thumb plaza) or Times Square Pudong or Pearl Tower, etc..In short, this area is superb for families. But for young couples looking for action, better to look somewhere in Puxi."
15,2295,"Oct 24 2004	nice but far from downtown	I accompanied my husband to Shanghai on business. While he worked, I spent my days shopping, sightseeing and spa-ing. This is a very nice hotel - good service, good food, clean and comfortable rooms. It is perfect for the business traveller, but quite a trek for a vacationer to commute to the other side of the river where almost all good shopping and sightseeing is located. Your best bet is to take a taxi to the nearest subway station (costs under 20 RMB in August 2004) then take the subway across the river - much faster than by taxi the whole way because traffic is almost always busy in Shanghai."
16,2295,Nov 6 2009	Ramada plaza: een unieke ervaring
17,2295,Jan 8 2008	Perfetto prima di partire
1,2296,Oct 18 2009 	good hotel	Good standard
2,2296,Jun 15 2009 	Okay for one night before flying	The Ramada hotel at Pudong airport is your average airport hotel and fine for a nights stay before flying out. Rooms are ok with everything you need but the bathrooms werea little cramped. All services were fine and i would use the hotel again if flying out of Shanghai Pudong. Free shuttle bus to and from the airport	
3,2296,Apr 1 2009 	Good Hotel	I stayed in this property for two weeks and was a bit concerned when I read the prior reviews from other fellow trip advisors. The hotel was booked by my work so I really did not have a choice. The room I stayed in was clean and room service was very good. I worked long hours during my stay and the house keeping would always leave a small snickers bar on my bed when I return at night. I thought that was quite nice.The staff at check in was efficient but I have to say their concierge was very average. I called them late at night once to organise a wake up call for the next morning as I had meetings to attend to. I never got my wake up call. When I questioned them they brushed me off and no one seemed to want to take responsibility. My room package also came with complimentary buffet breakfast every morning. The breakfast was crap. Everyday was the same food and the quality was very average. The location of the airport is good if you want a hotel to stay overnight. But its not very centralised. But you can always catch the hotel shuttle bus to the airport and connect to the Maglev to the Long Yang station and then transfer to the metroline if you want to go to Puxi.Finally
4,2296,Sep 15 2008 	Pathetic service	We have never in our life experienced such bad service. Rude and completely unwilling to help!!!	
5,2296,Sep 1 2008	Convenient airport hotel	I stayed at the Putong Ramada last week when I arrived at Shanghai late at night. The hotel is literally next to the aiport
6,2296,Jul 17 2008 	convenient for stopover	The hotel is next to Shanghai airport. There is a hotel shuttle bus at the terminal exit and the journey will take you less than 5 minutes. Check in is fast
7,2296,May 27 2008 	Old tired and noisy	Stayed here one night before flying out of PVG the next day. On arrival at the hotel the staff stood about for 5 minutes looking at us and our luggage before our interpreter shouted at them to get a porter - the first time that had happened in China so far.Rooms are old fashioned with old TV and small bathroom with no separate shower. Considering how new the airport looks
8,2296,Apr 21 2008 	sleep on the street rather than here	Okay nobody is at their best at 2 am but that's the deal on the night desk. We arrived into Pudong from Sanya and had just ten hours before our outward flight. The woman at the desk at the Ramada was possibly the rudest person I've ever come across in the 'service' industry - after our taxi driver from the airport. We'd been in China for three weeks already and had loved it - same as anywhere
9,2296,Mar 8 2008 	Convenient hotel for a stop-over in Shanghai	Ramada Pudong Airport Hotel (executive room)-efficient executive check-in is on the 7th floor with breakfast served from 6am. Hotel is a 5 minute shuttle bus ride from the airport terminal. Hotel shuttle is parked at bay #9 or #10 with a 30 minute frequency. The bay was not clearly marked and is located between the airport terminal and car park. Room is clean and has a small bathroom relative to the suite. Room amenities include a microwave
10,2296,Jan 4 2008 	Great for a stop-over	Stayed at this hotel whilst stopping-over in Shanghai and found the free airport pick-up / drop-off to be quick and convenient.The hotel itself was well presented with good service and facilities. The Brasserie restaurants buffet menus provided a wide range of dishes
11,2296,Oct 23 2007 	Beware of a few things	Airport hotels should be flexible with their check in times due to the very different arrival times of their guests. I heard that this property are really bad at this so emailed them the night before to say I would be in at 0800. I got to them at 0800 and no room was available. They told me I would have to wait almost 2 hours to get a room. NO WAY! I was tired and needed sleep so badly it was not funny. I spoke to the Duty Manager who sent me off to the cafe while the room was cleaned. Over an hour later I was in my room. Bad start! The room was ok actually - has a weird balcony which is enclosed. Then again
12,2296,Mar 17 2007 	Very good	Very pleasant stay at this hotel. Excellent for the airport - only 5 minutes by shuttle bus and also takes you to the Maglev station (in the airport) which then takes only 8 minutes to get to the new exhibition area. Food in the restaurant was good although the breakfast buffet could have been a bit hotter. Overall a good experience and would stay again.	
13,2296,Sep 18 2006 	Dated tired hotel with building works	We only stayed here overnight before our flight back to the uk. From the reviews i was expecting a nice relaxing room. However when we arrived i noticed building works. Half the hotel was being refurbished
14,2296,May 29 2006	Ideal stop over hotel.	Ideal for a stop over for connecting flights the next day. It was a right decision to stay over and get rested after a long overseas flight rather than making a conncection at the Hongqiao airport which is almost an hour away in the evening . The hotel shuttle bus pick up location is across from Exit 9 / 10 with the hotel name clearly marked on a concrete piller above the eye level. It is a smaller size (Perhaps 16 passangers) bus and it runs every 30 minutes which starts very early in the morning. The bus is also clearly marked with the hotel name. Be careful when loading as the bus was loading on the traffic side of the lane and we have also observed airport maintenance vehicles traveling in the opposite direction. When we arrived at the arrival level 
15,2296,May 29 2005	Best choice at PuDong Airport	The Ramada is situated at Pudong airport so it is a good choice for a late arrival or early morning departure. There is a shuttle bus that runs between the hotel and the airport every 30 minutes. This departs from the airport opposite Exit No. 9 or 10. Be aware that if you get a taxi most drivers do not understand English. Taxi or bus takes about 5 minutes between the two sites.Check in and out is straight forward. The staff are reasonably friendly and speak good English. Rooms are clean and comfortable
16,2296,Mar 17 2005	nice for a stopover	Conveniently located for the airport and the magnetic levitation train...but far from everywhere else. If you go into town ensure that the taxi doesn't go to the airport -and have to add ten minutes onto your journey -but takes the slip road just before the hotel - get the concierge to write it in chinese on the little map on the back of the hotel card. This is a good hotel for a stopover and you can just make it into town for a quick morning on the levitation train and metro
17,2296,Dec 15 2004	comfort 	I had the opportunity to stay at the Ramada Pudong Airport Hotel twice over the past two weeks. It's located immediatly adjacent to the airport property
18,2296,Oct 19 2009 	??????????????		
19,2296,Sep 24 2009 	???????		
20,2296,Oct 25 2007 	Sehr gutes Hotel und klasse Service		
1,2298,"Nov 8 2009 	Worst service and hotel in recent memory.	I booked a regular room at first and it was the smallest room I have ever seen. I was there only 2 nights so I let it go then I was taking a shower and the water suddenly went icy cold and it was winter in Shanghai. Fortunately, I was almost done with my shower or I would have frozen in the shower. I called the desk and there was no apology. I requested a transfer to the suite and paid double the price with no discount. The room was spacious but then the internet was not working - again no apology or discount and insisted that there was something wrong with my notebook. I could not accept it as it was working just a while ago in the small room I transferred from. Then I wanted to cook some food and I was told that I have to pay 10 yuan for each utensil. I would not stay again at this hotel even if it is free."
2,2298,"Jun 7 2009 	Best Value for Money	If you dont need any frills - just stay here. They give you a nice comfortable rooms, I got one at the 26th floor - the view was amazing with nice cool breeze. The rooms a bit small but very comfortable and clean - what more can you ask for USD 30. Just carry the map of the location along with you, as not many Taxi drivers know the location of Service apartments."
3,2298,"Nov 23 2008 	Great value for Families	I stayed there in one of their 3-bedroom apartments at the end of November with my family of 5 (all adults) for 3 nights. The apartment was spacious and had a large living and dining area. The apartment is very modernly design and of a high quality for what we were expecting from the price we paid.The few issues we had were the front desk which I found the staff to be rude and unhelpful (even the bell boy was more friendly and helpful!). Also, whilst the apartment was fully furnished, the kitchen was completely empty of any utensils and the washing machine in the laundry had no water pipe installed which needed a call to maintenance to fix. Although the location was not close to places of interest, considering the price and quality it was worth staying at Rayfont (since price of taxi's is fairly cheap in Shanghai).Since we were traveling in a group of 5, Rayfont was the best choice we could find."
4,2298,"Nov 14 2008 	not too bad for your money	Not too expensive , stayed 4 nights in small basic room approx 450 rmb Quite modern and clean. But romm was very small and almost no desk for computer. Then changed room for one bedroom apartment type with kitchenette and living room. Much more spacious but almost twice the rate .Restaurant breakfast is OK but nothing more (half chinese half western style)Staff was quite professionnal but need to repeat many time coz their english is.... SO SO At the end that was OKHotel location is ..... so so Not in a busy district so you have to walk at leat 15 minutes ( or taxi ) to find shops and restaurants.At the end , that was not too bad . I would return for short stay but as a second choice only . I would try another place . Nothing really amazing from this place except low prices from basic rooms...."
5,2298,"Nov 3 2008	Okie for a Short trip	We stayed in a 2-bedroom Apartment in Block B on the 26th floor for 5 nights. Rooms are neat and clean and there's nothing much to complain about it. Breakfast is not good so we decided to go out and have breakfast instead.One thing about the staff, they do not speak much English but fortunately we were able to speak mandarin to them. We asked one the the staff regarding shopping areas in Shanghai and he recommended me a street full of shops. (That was around 6 in the evening). So I hailed a taxi to proceed there. I was shocked that all the stores were closed. He didn't inform me that the shops were closed by then. In the end, I had to take a taxi to another shopping area.If you are just staying without using the facilities then its fine. I went to the pool on the 3rd day of my stay and found it weird because a swimming cap is needed before going to the pool and you gotta purchase it from them if you don't have it. It was an &quot;indoor&quot; swimming pool, Why i say &quot;indoor&quot; is because previously it was raining and there were droplets of water dripping from the &quot;indoor&quot; pool glass ceiling. Maintenance of the pool area was kind of poor.I would probably think twice of staying there again for that amount I paid for."
6,2298,"Sep 29 2008 	Great if you have a lot of patience and can tolerate incompetence.	FACTS. I reserved my hotel room through www.hotels.com for $59.00/night. I stayed there for 18 days during the '08 Olympics. . If you don't smoke, make sure you stress to the travel agent or online booking company that you want a non-smoking room. Those rooms are located on the first eight floors of the building. In other words, don't expect a non-smoking room on the high stories. . I made sure that I called the hotel a few days before my arrival to confirm my reservation. Always do that. Luckily, they did have my reservation though language was a barrier. The hotel telephone number is [-].. Once you arrive at PVG airport and get your luggage, exchange $500 to RMBs/Yuans at the bank kiosk located in the baggage claim area. At the time, the rate was $1.00 = 6.74 RMBs/Yuans (pronounced Kwan). Warning, do not trust the exchange bank tellers as they slipped with the 100 RMB/Yuan notes two fake 100 bills. As the saying goes, you only know what you know. I discovered a couple days later when no one would accept my two 100 bills that they were fake, in fact they were color copies, SOB! Taxi drivers gave me the &quot;are you kidding me?&quot; look. It was embarrassing. I ended up shredding and throwing them away. Learn this -- most fake bills are 20 RMBs/Yuans. 100s are rare but I was the unfortunate one. Check every single 20 and 100 RMBs/Yuans bill even if you get change from a bank teller, a hotel front desk employee, a store clerk, a restaurant, or even a taxi driver rushing to give you your change back in rush hour traffic. Stop and take your time checking every single 20 and 100 bill. You do that by scratching your fingernail against the neck or hat of General Mao Tse-Tung. If you don't feel crevices then it's likely a fake. Don't worry if you get rushed or clerks laugh at you trying to be smart for checking for fake bills. Do it if you don't find your money hanging on trees. I learned my lesson the hard way and ended up catching a few fakes a few days in Shanghai.. The hotel was an hour drive from PVG airport. Cost me approximately, 100 RMBs/Yuans, which is not bad at all. Make sure you print a copy off the Internet of the hotel address in Chinese for the taxi driver or better yet, print the attached scanned card and show it to the Taxi driver. Most drive very fast. Close your eyes and think happy thoughts. No tipping in China. The hotel was formerly known as Rayfont Celebrity Service Hotel and Apartments. It is located at 1077 Xie Tu Road (pronounced Che Two Lu) and its intersection with Ruijin Road (pronounced Roohen Lu), Lu meaning Road. . At check in time, the front desk will run a debit for 1000 RMBs/Yuans deposit which they are supposed to return to you if their has been no damage to the room.. The single room reminds me a bit of a room at the W Hotels in the States -- dark brown somewhat contemporary furniture. The room had a Queen-size bed with a nice large leather headboard, like in most hotels in China, the mattress had no padding, in other word, it felt like sleeping on a hard surface, which did not bother me since it is better for my back; however, the majority of Westerners will find it extremely uncomfortable. The room also included a desk, a chair, two end tables, one table lamp, a dresser, a decent-size closet, a small combination safe, and an analog television with 60 some channels including English language American channels. The room looked exactly like the panoramic picture advertised on the website; however, the room is not as big as it appears in the picture. After all, it is a panoramic picture so it makes the room look larger. The size of the bedroom was 10ft x 12ft including the furniture. There was 3ft clearance all around the bed.. My room was very clean and was odorless.. The AC in the room worked great. You can freeze in your room when the outside temperature in August reaches 95 degrees.. You can get Internet service in your room via an Ethernet cable for about 40 RMBs/Yuans or $5.00/day. Instead, I wirelessly and freely joined an unlocked Linksys Network by placing my laptop computer close to the sliding door at the end of the bed. Sometimes the connection was weak but it was enough to check my e-mails until I made it to a coffee shop or restaurant where usually free wireless Internet service is available. . The bathroom looked like the picture advertised on the website as well. Stand up shower, commode, a faucet to wash feet, plenty of cabinet space, heated lamps for the winter, plenty of clean towels, combs, tooth paste, tooth brush, hair cap, soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. . Housekeeping did a great job. A team of two girls usually knocks on your door between 9:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. They are very sweet, polite and humble. They don't speak English. Expect a knock on the door even if you clearly place the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign outside on the door handle. They did every single day regardless -- just accept it. They are not stupid -- they're just trying to do their job. They seemed honest, nothing was taken from my room, not my MacBook Pro, not my iPod, not my camera, not my PDA, not my souvenirs -- nothing. They replace your sheets every third day in an effort to conserve water (Kudos); however, they did replace my towels every single day I asked to, mopped the bedroom/bathroom/balcony floors, and wiped the dust. No tipping in China.. Although the floors are concrete, one can easily hear guests in the floor above walking or their bed frame banging against the headboard or floor whenever they are getting it on. That is expected because construction quality in China is not up to par.. I was not able to hear traffic or construction noise during my 18-day stay at the hotel -- of course the sliding door to the balcony was always closed. By the way, make sure that door is in the lock position because the balcony has a fire exit door leading to a stairwell.. I never felt unsafe anytime during my stay at the hotel even when I returned after midnight; however, I brought to the attention of the assistant manager the fact that their is not security guard who checks access keys or whether a guest is staying at the hotel before letting the person walk through the lobby and catch the elevator up. He was sincere and showed interest in what I was trying to make him aware of. He assured me that the hotel has a security guard. What he was referring to was a young guy who waits outside the hotel door holding a Walkie-Talkie. He usually opens the passenger door whenever a taxi pulls up to the hotel entrance. Not once did any of the guys who work the third shift ask me for credentials, which is a standard practice in most hotels around the world. After all, anyone would have not problem walking into the hotel late at night, taking the elevator up to a room and breaking in.. The assistant manager at the hotel was William Yuan. Very nice, professional, soft-spoken, young fella. He spoke English very well and was eager to assist me. I was very impressed with his outstanding customer service and managerial skills.. Although there is a restaurant in the hotel, I did not eat there because I was told that it is not that good. I can't say for sure.. Be aware that sending your dirty clothes to be laundered at the hotel can be very expensive. For example, to wash each plain white undershirt, T-shirt, underwear, etc. will cost you $20 RMBs/Yuans = $3.00. Each shorts will cost you 25 RMBs/Yuans = $4.00. Your best bet if you need to wash your clothes is to get out of the hotel, make a right on Xie Tu Road, walk to the next street, make a right, walk to the apartment building behind the hotel and you will find a public Laundromat. Make sure you check their price sheet. . One Wednesday midnight on my way back to the hotel, the taxi passed by a Karaoke club on Xie Tu Road approximately 300 yards across from the hotel. There were lots of attractive women and I mean really, really attractive girls existing the club. The taxi pulled up to the hotel entrance. It was a little after midnight. In the hotel lobby I counted six girls sitting on the couches and two standing talking to one another. First thing that came to mind was: &quot;Holy Toledo, there must have been a fashion show at the hotel while I was out wasting my time at Starbucks and Costa Coffee Shop.&quot; The women I saw in the hotel lobby that night were b.e.a.u.t.i.f.u.l. Not your average, 5'10&quot; Shanghainese, long black hair, pretty girls. These girls looked like models - no kidding. I have traveled to many places in this world like Russia, Ukraine, Italy, France, Brazil, Germany, Denmark, Japan, you name it but these were different. They looked like models. They were not vulgar. They did not speak to anyone. They were not sleazy looking. The scene looked like an after-fashion show function. The concierge, who was trying to keep his eyes open because in China employees work 12-hour shifts, did not pay attention to the girls. They all were minding their business. I asked him whether I had missed a fashion show. He explained that they were working girls that just left the Karaoke club down the street and came to the hotel to earn some money in return for services should a single/lonely guest shows interest. He added that they are professionals and charge 120 RMBs/Yuans = $18. He also mentioned that the working girls have clearance from the hotel and are tested. I asked him whether the sight of working girls in the lobby offends guests. He replied that they are low key despite their beauty. That they know exactly who is single and is staying alone at the hotel and who is not. Folks, I learned later that this is typical in all hotels in China even at the most luxurious hotels at the &quot;Bund&quot; that many tourists refer to and recommend in their reviews. Again, this is typical in all hotels there. Since this is not my cup of tea, I ended up going up to my room by myself and slept face down. :-)WHAT I WISH WAS DIFFERENT - Let me begin by saying that no one in China is obligated to cater to those of us whose native language is English and I respect that; however, at this hotel and elsewhere in China there was the language barrier. Most front desk employees and concierges speak and understand a little English. Let me stress the word little. In rare cases, I was able to find a concierge who spoke and understood English well. I was blessed with one concierge at this hotel who understood me and was very helpful in recommending places to dine, professional /well-reputable massage parlors, wrote directions in Chinese to give to the taxi drivers, etc.. The most irritating and frustrating things that left a really bad taste in my mouth were:(i) Receiving calls in my room. Almost every time my girlfriend called the hotel, gave them my room number, my last name, and asked to be transferred, the front desk operator(s) acted clueless and failed to transfer the call. She called me every morning during the 18 days I stayed at this hotel and went through the teeth pulling process to reach me. Even my Chinese buddy who lived in Shanghai and spoke perfect Mandarin Chinese became very frustrated with repeated incidents of stupidity and incompetence of the front desk operator(s). They hang up the phone on him a few times. No kidding. (ii) The incompetence of the front desk/reservation again due to the language barrier and not taking initiative. Say you want to check out two days before your scheduled date. So you call Hotels.com to inform them you will be leaving earlier than scheduled. You go downstairs and inform (clearly and slowly) the front desk staff of your plans. You ask them to document in their system that the guest in room # .. will be checking out two days earlier. The front desk staff assures you that they noted it in their system. You stop by the next day just to be 100% sure but this time around the staff at the front desk are not aware of what your plans are and cannot find any notes! So you inform them again (clearly and slowly) of your plans. On your checkout day, you have a final walk through with housekeeping to confirm that there has been no damage to the room and nothing is missing. You request from the housekeeping girls to call the front desk and inform them that everything is okay. They do make the call while you are standing there. You go downstairs to check out and they are really quick to check you out. You ask them for the 1000 RMBs/Yuans deposit back but they say they cannot do that yet until they check that there has been no damage to the room! Fifteen minutes wasted while the taxi is waiting at the entrance and you are running late to the airport. You have them call housekeeping again to confirm. They do and finally return the deposit. You ask them regarding the refund of the two nights you will not be staying there. They reply that Hotels.com will have to call them to confirm that you checked out earlier than planned. On your way to the airport you call Hotels.com. They call the hotel and confirm that you left. You are expecting a refund to your credit card, right? Guess what  30 days pass and no refund! You call Hotels.com and they call the hotel to confirm but the front desk is unable to find the reservation in their system so the person on the phone passes the buck and ask the Hotels.com representative to call the next day to speak to someone else. Welcome to China folks  ask a simple question and more than likely you will end up getting passed to five different individuals before your question is answered. I guess they just shy away whenever there is a language issue."
7,2298,"Sep 16 2008	A good hotel with a slightly out-of-the-way location	Having booked the Rayfont on Hotels.com for a rate of less than GBP 30 a night I wasn't expecting great things. I was pleasantly surprised. The inside of the hotel is attractive and my double room was well-presented, with wood effect flooring, lots of storage and a balcony. The bathroom was beautifully appointed and very spacious. My room and the hotel as a whole were clean and seemed to be well-maintained. There is a good pool which is free to guests, and which the receptionist made a point of mentioning at check-in. The hotel restaurant on the first floor was attractively decorated and, apart from breakfast, suprisingly reasonably priced. Staff were friendly and the concierge was particularly helpful in translating destinations into Chinese characters for taxi drivers and arranging taxis. The downside of this hotel was the location - there is no metro station nearby and it took twenty to thirty minutes to reach places of interest in taxis; although these are cheap, the hassle and the cost could mount up if you like to come and go from your hotel during the day. I agree with the previous reviewer that it's extremely hard to find primary information on this hotel online. After a lot of searching, I stumbled across the hotel's website in English (http://www.longemonthotels.com/en/dyrf/)."
8,2298,"Aug 31 2008 	Rayfont - not a bad option	Initially found this place on Expedia and wanted to find more info. But it'svery difficult hotel to locate this hotel on www. I eventually found their website but it was in Chinese only, with no rates or online booking, so pretty useless. Additionally, their business card states no web or email address.Location: South west Shanghai. Not usefully near a metro, unless you really want to walk for 15 mins in searing heat. Therefore, taxis everywhere. Average price was 25 rmb, average journey time was 20 mins or so. Depends on time of day, destination, of course. Getting a taxi home in the rush hour was a nightmare. 45-60 mins fom Pu Dong airport, 30-45 mins to Hong Qiao. Small metro next to the hotel, some restaurants within walking distance. Most taxi drivers didn't have a clue where to find it, so take a card from the hotel.Accomodation: we booked a &quot;luxury 3 bedroom deluxe suite&quot; at 79 per night (expedia). Initially booked for 2 nights in case we didn't like it. But we did like it and stayed for a further 5 nights. The apartment was spacious and well equipped, quite well maintained and modern with dark wood flooring throughout, comprising:1 king size bedroom with en-suite (the en-suite was a bit tired and had a shower over the bath). 2 further double bedrooms and a separate shower roomwhich was in good condition. Good size living room with 2 sofas, dining table and chairs, tv, cabinet, etc. Basic but comfortable and very welcoming.Fully equipped kitchen (glasses, cutlery, plates etc available on request) and washing room (with washing m/c). Huge balcony wrapping round the whole apartment. Dirty, unfortunately, as were all the windows.Internet was available at 3.6 rmb per day, plus .06 rmb per minute, or 300 rmb per month. Apartment was cleaned daily and the laundry service was effective if a bit expensive.Didn't bother with the restaurant, except for one late breakfast which was utterly pathetic. Pool looks good, and very big. There's a massage place in the basement. Staff were fine, although my wife is Chinese so I was spared the usual communication problems.Would I go again? If I needed to accomodate 3 or more people, or a family, definitely. If it was just two adults, I'd go for a better location."
9,2298,"Jun 16 2008	Avoid if possible	We were not at all impressed with this hotel. We had a two bedroom apartment, which consisted of 2 bedrooms with a small hall connecting them, along with a small closet and bathroom. First, the good: the room on the 23rd floor had a nice view of the courtyard, and was relatively noise free (from outside noises anyhow). There were TVs in both bedrooms which got a lot of channels (once we plugged in the coax cable, which was unplugged), including several English channels. Check-in and check-out were somewhat efficient, and at least they had our prepaid reservation (unlike the person behind us whose reservation they had lost). That's about the end of the good...The rooms reeked of smoke (we are non-smokers, but have stayed in smoking rooms many times without a problem, but the smell in these rooms was enough to make you sick). The beds were very hard with springs poking up at you, and the mattress sagged so you had a tendency to roll towards the middle. They required a 1000 CNY deposit, and had a long list of things they could charge you for &quot;damaging&quot;, even though the room was already in poor shape. There were 3 of us, and when we asked for a new towel, we were presented with a receipt showing a 90 CNY charge, which we eventually, after much struggle, figured out that was the charge for not returning the extra towel. The floors seemed very thin as we could hear people above us moving around, and to top our experience out, we had to kill several bugs (beetles?) in the bathroom. I would really recommend you spend a few more dollars and stay somewhere else."
10,2298,"Apr 9 2008 	Not for Celebrities....	Out of the centre of Shanghai just beside the french concession, the Celebrity is a typical asian serviced appartment that offers exactly what it advertises - great space for bargin $$$.The appartments are relatively easy to find for taxi drivers ,but bring the hotel card just in case - in the imediate locality there are lots of small shops to stock up on snacks and drinks for the appartment and some good bakeries for breakfast. If you enjoy walking, the ex-pat area, with all it's bars and restaurants, in the French Concession is a 15 minute walk throught the tree lined streets.The room (we had a delux suite) was large with seperate kitchen (with utensils) dining area sitting room and seperate bedroom. Comfy sofa (which opened out into a bed) and large tv lent to comfortable lounging space in the evenings. Good hard bed but basic bathroom (rubbish shower). Decor was excellent with good black out curtains to stop the early morning sun, but not the trafic noise!Staff were friendly and tried to help but had minimal english - matching our minimal mandarin! On arrival reception had no record of our booking - it transpired that they couldn't read the name on my passport properly, looking for a booking in the name of James (my middle name!!!!!)Didn't eat in the cafe: it looked ok though &amp; always seemed busy.The pool and spa area were basic but sufficient for a few laps to wake up in the morning.For the money Celebrity offers fantastic space for those travelling with children rather than being cooped up in Shanghai's small hotel rooms. Not central but within a taxi ride of anywhere!Recommended."
11,2298,"Jan 14 2008 	Too far out	It smells. Shanghai smells, so does this hotel. It puts the Sh into Shanghai. But this city that's grown too fast didn't really advance plan the sewerage system, so perhaps this hotel is like others. The staff try their best. Their English levels really aren't that bad and they're eager to help. The rooms look good on the website but close up they are bony and uncomfortable. In their favour they're huge but just not inviting. The local area is rubbish. There is nothing to see or do, so you end up getting taxis in and out of the centre of town. Fortunately they're pretty cheap. If you've got the money, then stay in one of the super luxury hotels. If you haven't, then just don't bother with Shanghai."
12,2298,"Dec 11 2007 	A reasonable hotel at a fair price	Stayed in the family suite with 3 bedrooms and one big living room. It had a kitchen as well. Stayed there for 3 days and it was perfect for us. We stayed 6 people there, so instead of getting 3 rooms, we decided to try out the big suite. Worked out pretty well as there are 2 bathrooms with showers (one of them had a bathtub as well), a large kitchen and a large living room + the 3 bedrooms of course, so nobody got tired of sitting on each others laps. The living room was a natural meeting point and it had a large dining table and a coffee table, where we could all sit. A drawback is definitely the breakfast. Not that inspiring, but is was pretty cheap (20 RMB). There was a good little kiosk just next to the hotel where we bought some food instead. We had to pay extra for the plates, knives and forks as the kitchen was totally empty but even then we just gave up on making our own dinner and went out instead, so don't count on making 3 star Michelin dinner here. Would recommend the room for 3 couples like us. The service at the hotel was fair. The location was a little bit away from the center but pretty close to our Shanghai office though not walking distance. Next time I'll rather choose something closer to the city center and take a cab to the office..."
13,2298,"Nov 13 2007	A well run hotel	I spent almost two weeks here over the special olympics, I chose it based on it's location, reviews and price and I certainly wasn't disappointed.Check in wasn't the best, the staff barely spoke any english but once we got over the formalities and were direct to our room our minds were put to ease. The rooms were in great condition and with excellent views across the city.The only down side to the hotel was the resturant wasn't the best, poor cloice of food and the back of the room needed to be painted. There was no prblem getting taxi's to and from the hotel. Also, it hasn't been mentioned before but the hotel actually has three ATM machines besides the lift, so no need to walk down the street to withdraw cash."
14,2298,"Oct 7 2007 	A Well Kept Celebrity Secret	Getting there: From Pudong Airport about 160 CYN. Best to have a map &amp; Chinese translation of the hotel on hand for the driver. Found one online which was a lifesaver. Keep in mind that most taxi drivers speak little to no English. Check in/Check out: There is a 1500 CYN guarantee charge by visa card on check in, but this is refunded on checking out. Had no problems with my credit card at all after that. Checking in and out was easy. There was an English speaking staff available to assist.Conceige Services: Provided a good map and helpful information. Luggage storage facilities available - in fact they held our bags for us for 2 days as we went to Hangzhou and didn't want to lug them along. Also helped us book tickets for Era - Intersection of Time, which was quite a distance away, had we wanted to get them ourselves. We had tried initially to book online before we arrived, but to no avail.Rooms: We booked the 2 bedrooms apartment - and we were thrilled. There were 2 bedrooms with double bed (a little hard, but I found that alright), telephones and television in each. In one of the rooms, there was a refrigerator and tea making facilities. Bedroom slippers were available and each room had its own airconditioning. Handy for those that like varying temperature and gets up at varying times! And all this for about 50, was simply unbelievable in Shanghai!!! There are 2 blocks - A,B and C,D. In the first part of our stay, we were in the C block which was better than the A block, which appeared holder and had a damp problem. We were quite high up, which was good as that meant no noise! Shanghai is a very busy city!!! Bathrooms were showers only - no tubs. There was a plumbing issue, which I think is rather common throughout the country. Easily remedied by a good ol'plunger which they were quick to sort out.Entertainment: Television were local channels. Hardly used any of the hotels facilities, although I am not sure what facilities they had. I think there was massage services and a coffee shop in house. They also had local English papers and magazines. Best to bring a novel.Location &amp; Local Amenities: SItuated about 15 minutes from a metro station - Da Ma Qiao, which was handy and efficient. Otherwise, hotel staff hails taxis for guests. Please be aware that there may be a queue in the morning for taxis. Taxis are cheap and safe. As Shanghai is so spread out, taxis are more or less an essential - but use the official taxi rank!!! Local Amenities include a supermarket about 5 minutes walk away - cash and local credit cards only. There are also bakeries and &quot;pao&quot; stalls (steamed chinese bun) and convenience stalls nearby. Silk King is at the Da Ma Qiao junction for those wanting to buy Silk. Overall, would stay here again. Good value, and convenient. But if you are looking for 5 star comfort, this isn't it! This is more of a local business/family hotel, where one is looking for a clean and decent accomodation as a base."
15,2298,"Aug 29 2007 	Neither heaven nor hell	During our 11-night stay at the Celebrity we experienced just about everything the prior reviewers noted with the exception of the location. It is not within walking distance of any tourist attractions, especially in hot August. The property is relatively new, but already showing some signs of age and deferred maintenance. I saw the plunger outside my front door, and was prepared for the worst, but we did not need to use it. The cleanliness was ok. The damp mopping was merely spreading around soil, as I wiped up spills on my kitchen floor and the paper towel came up with a black film. Ok, here are the details. The front desk and staff ranged from smiling to dismissive. Rarely were they truly helpful. They clearly suffered from what ails many Chinese hotels. The public contact staff were process oriented and not customer oriented. Being forewarned by previous reviews, we inspected our refrigerator as soon as we entered the room and found it plugged in, turned on and room temperature inside. We asked to be relocated immediately.Our deluxe suite was on special on Travelocity, a great deal. This hotel does rate a high value, as you get to prepare your own western breakfast with range, coffee maker, and hot water pot. For 50 Yuan you can rent basic tableware and cookware. It's a good deal for longer stays, allowing spoiled westerners to enjoy their eggs their style and cold breakfast cereals just like home. A Century Mart is about four blocks east and has a good selection of groceries, fruits and vegetables. The convenience store is two doors west.The deluxe rooms are comfortable with nice sofa and side chair, living room table, TVs in both bed and living rooms, and a dining room table and four chairs. The beds are reasonably soft considering it is China. By western standards they are very firm, much better than rock hard common in China. Sheets are changed every few days, but they will change daily on request. The maids tried hard. The problem with damp mopping without frequent rinses in clean water is a training issue. Another long-term occupant with different maids complained to me in the elevator and with the assistant manager in the lobby about lack of cleanliness in his unit.The restaurant has a reasonably priced limited breakfast buffet. After one try, we opted for cooking/preparing our own. The location is south of downtown, from 15 to 25 yuan by taxi from most tourist attractions. Taxis are cheap, but daytime gridlock make them problematical sometimes. The doormen were very efficient in obtaining taxis from the street.The internet service worked as advertised. The plug converter, extra pillows and extra towels all required a signed receipt, promising to pay for them if they were missing upon checkout. The south view from the high floors takes in the Huangpu River, and the site of the 2010 World Expo along the river.If mediocre is good enough and you are value driven, the Celebrity will be a decent choice. The longer term reservation specials price this property in the bargain range per square foot for a three-star property. The two and three bedroom units are certainly a draw for a family or small group of friends. If you require more attentive service and/or require some pampering, you will not be happy at the Celebrity."
16,2298,"Jun 11 2007 	Underwhelmed	We stayed here largely due to positive reviews which we now find puzzling. Indeed this is a new hotel but we experienced a number of basic failures. Plumbing was poor - housekeeping plunged the toilet more than once, though there was little more than paper to confront. The refrigerator was slightly cooler than room temperature, a fact we discovered after our chicken salad sandwiches had spoiled. The manager had to splice wires to get our Internet connected. Service was somewhere between lax and arrogant. Upon requesting a late checkout, the Assistant Manager told us (very belatedly), &quot;Ha ha, no, you see... this is Shanghai. We don't do that here.&quot; We've stayed in ten or so diverse hotels in Shanghai; there are many fine options out there at reasonable prices. The old adage still rings true: you usually get what you pay for."
17,2298,Apr 30 2007 	Amazing Hotel	AMAZING hotel.Very near to attractions.Friendly staff(atleast one English speaking).Chepest Hotel you can find.The hotel is almost new with all the facilities.Dont spend too much on Brand name hotels.
18,2298,"Apr 4 2007 	Great Value for Money	I stayed here with my brother and his friends last March and I its a good place to stay when you are running on a tight budget. Unlike the previous hotel I stayed in, in Shanghai last December, this is more standard stuff. No down pillows or L'occitane toiletries. But lets just say adequate. The room was okay, we got a two bedroom unit, though the beds were small and we had to share beds, it was okay...its not like it was cramped. The problem was there was only 1 bathroom so mornings were hell.The staff can't speak much english so it helps if you can speak mandarin. there is a bank next door if you need money and a convenience store next to it...so you can buy supplies. Anyway its a good hotel, and an even greater value for money."
19,2298,"Mar 14 2007 	Highly recommended!!	We stayed at this hotel during Chinese New Year, it was fantastic! The place was spotless with a modern bathroom and comfortable bed. We got a room on the highest level and had a view to the top of the famous oriental pearl tower. As it was chinese new year, we had free firework shows everynight which made our stay even more special. Service was excellent and the hotel offers an affordable buffet breakfast at affordable prices. Anyone looking for a reasonable priced, lovely hotel should consider the Celebrity Apartment. Although a bit far from all the touristy places, it is situated in a quiet neighborhood with taxis your doorstep."
20,2298,"Jan 25 2007 	Great Hotel	This was a great hotel for the price, and had a fantastic balcony and view. The room was really clean and there was always at least one staff memeber on duty who spoke English. Not really walking distance from the BUND at all, but easy to find a taxi any time day or night. Also, located less than 1 block from a 7-11 type store, so no worries about having to purchase water or snacks in the hotel. The bed was really comfortable, and the room was bigger than many that I had in China (maybe small by American standards). Highly Suggested!"
21,2298,"Oct 29 2006 	Best Value in Shanghai-Excellent Hotel great service	We stayed on this hotel from October 16, 2006 through October 25, 2006. The hotel is very well located, the staff is helpful and they even have a concierge. The rooms are very clean and well appointed. The breakfast buffett has everything, including chinese favorites and western style breakfast.The staff english skills are like 7 in a 1 to 10 scale but enough to help you through your stay.. The air conditioning in the rooms is excellent and the broadband access, although has an additional charge, runs very well. The only minor flaw is that the drainage of the bathtubs and toilets are somewhat slowTransportation to and from the hotel is easy as catching a taxi is very easy. The hotel business cards have a map printed in the backside so your cab driver knows how to return you to the hotel.I will not look any further when I go back to Shanghai. This hotel is a winner.."

1,2300,"Oct 8 2009 	Decent hotel interesting location	This hotel is actually inside a soccer stadium. If you stay in a room between 1st and 9th floor you won't have a street view (you will be looking at the inside/lobby of the stadium. The basic rooms are slow but very clean and well-equipped. The hotel has a nice restaurant which serves great breakfast (combination of Chinese and western food). It has a health spa in the lobby which looks plush from the outside. There are some stores and a bar also located in the stadium. Not sure if there is anything else nearby. Overall, not crazy about the location but the hotel itself is very nice as a 4-star facility."

3,2300,"Oct 26 2008	All depends which room you get	Stayed for a five-night business trip and I have to say that both room standard and service quality is extremely variable, depending on which room you get or whom of the many staff you deal with. On the website the hotel looks like a good idea and very different from others as it claims to have great views of the inside of Shanghai Stadium. As I had booked a &quot;stadium view&quot; room I was looking forward to this experience but as it turned out my room looked onto an interior staircase of the stadium, and most of my colleagues had the same problem. Many of the &quot;stadium view&quot; rooms are very small and most of them pitch-dark even during the day as the do not get any sunlight at all. My second room, to which I was only moved after hours of negotiation and dealing with no less than five staff, was very different: bright, airy, large windows, views (of a flyover, but at least it did have a view of sorts). Some staff were very nice and courteous, others were plain rude. I felt that as long as operations were running smoothly staff were in a well-rehearsed friendly routine, but whenever things went wrong many of them turned into a &quot;not my problem, try somebody else&quot; mode. Overall, an average experience."
4,2300,"Aug 3 2008 	Very Convenient Hotel	This hotel was selected for me by my company, so I did not know what to expect. From my research, it appeared to be far away from the downtown area of Shanghai. It proved to be a very convenient location, as it was easy to get to it by taxi. It is also a block away from the subway. Considering the extensive road construction in Shanghai, not all hotels are easy to get to, even though they may be more central, and not all hotels necessarily have a great supply of taxis waiting outside.My room was very large, and quite clean. Their breakfast buffet had many choices - typical Chinese, Japanese, and European/North American.There was consistently a fleet of taxis waiting outside, which given their inexpensive price, was my preferred mode of transportation in Shanghai. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to my friends, for sure."
5,2300,"Jul 13 2008 	Great experience at the Regal	Stayed for one night at the Regal. Although I had only booked a club floor room, I was upgraded to a club floor suite when I checked in - a pleasant surprise! Suite was very well appointed with central lighting control, electronic blinds, 3 LCD TV's and a massive bathroom with a muti-head shower. Several of the items (including beer) in the mini-bar were complementary as well - a nice touch.The room included buffet breakfast, which was good, as well as high speed internet. Can't think of anything negative to say except that the location may not be ideal for tourists, since it was a longish (35 min) , 45 RMB cab ride from Pudong to the hotel."

7,2300,"Oct 23 2007 	After location confusion a good experience	The Regal Hotel group should be scolded for (purposeful deception) . It has two Shanghai properties, both called Regal East Asia. One of them (not this one) has the word &quot;international&quot; innocuously inserted into its title, but it is also frequently omitted. So if you book this hotel thinking that you're on Hengshan Road (a happening nightlife area) you're wrong. This hotel is located inside the Shanghai Sports stadium ground, set back from the road. Easy to miss unless your taxi driver has been here before. Other than the location switch, this hotel does exceed expectations. The outfittings are relatively new and high quality, rooms have plenty of light and are well designed (for use of space). All amenities are provided, as if this were a five star hotel. The pool is also excellent: 20 meters, infinity edge, and clean. And, rooms have a view of the sports stadium. The downside is that this hotel is located in a &quot;local&quot; but up-and coming middle class area of Shanghai. It's out of the way (centrally) but convenient for taking the metro, being on the intersection of two metro lines. If you don't mind the southwest Shanghai location and lack of foreign-oriented diversions, this hotel could work for you."

And seems nothing lost, then we agreeded, later when we arrived the room for already 30 mins, and we were taking a rest, I was sleeping on bed, and my boyfriend was walking around with his little shorts...suddenly, someone opened the door by their keys...and we shouted. Is their staff. I cried what's happend? And she said she didn't know guests were inside, and she was coming to collect all the foods and drinks in the fridge...Oh~I thought this was annoyed, you know? Since we have been here and checked in for already 30 mins...and this is strange for the staff to come in suddenly, and it ruined our privacy, I was going to complain but she said sorry to us, so I forgave her then. Besides this experience, the hotel is nice."
10,2300,"Jun 20 2007 	Solid Hotel at a Good Price	I stayed 4 nights at the Regal Shanghai East Asia hotel and had a pretty good experience. I booked this hotel based on the room rates and the close proximity to the Metro Station.Check-in was fine, apart from I had to point out that breakfast was included in my room rate. The room itself was better than I expected and was a pretty decent size and standard. The bathroom was clean.The Metro station is a 2 minute walk away and from there the rest of Shanghai is easily accessible - I just wish the trains ran an hour or two later at night! You pass a Starbucks on the way to the Metro station and there is a supermarket built in to the other side of the stadium.This is a good hotel, and while it doesn't have any of Shanghai's main attractions on it's doorstep, I was willing to sacrifice that in order to save some cash. The Metro is efficient enough and taxis are cheap so that the location doesn't make much difference."
11,2300,"Nov 15 2006 	Interesting location!	I stayed at the Regal Shanghai for 6 nights very recently. As the hotel part of the Shanghai stadium, it is fairly easy for taxi riders to find. The fare from Pudong airport was about 170 RMB. The hotel reception is ok, we had booked a Regal Club room so we used the check-in at the 12th floor. The lounge staff were very helpful and nice all throughout our stay, assisting us with restaurant bookings etc. There was a lady called Kris and she was a star! The lounge (breakfast and evening drinks + snacks are included in the rate plan) is a bit old fashioned but ok. The selection for food is limited but as the lounge is never very busy (only saw about a max of 10 people there at any one time), I guess it is not worth for the hotel to provide more. Everything we had and tried was perfectly fine. Our room, 1215, was one of the old rooms. The hotel is having re-vamp at the moment and quite rightly so. The furniture is very 1980's and the carpet has seen better days. The size of the room was great and everything worked. The rates in general are decent considering that most 3-4* hotels in Shanghai are very pricey. The tube station is only about 5 mins walk away and there are plenty of taxis. I didn't use any of the hotel facilities (shops, spa etc) but they all look ok. Moods bar, also on the 12th Floor, is ok but lacks atmosphere. The French Concession is a great place to wonder about and Sasha's (a western style bar) is not far. M on Bund was great for a meal as was Shintori. The People 7 bar was very trendy but service wasn't that great. There is a bar on Julu Road called the Goodfellas ( a bit seedy) but they give our free beer if you go early in the evening! A river cruise in the evening is a must - the view is amazing. Perhaps one of the nicest days we had was a day trip to one of the canal towns. The nearest one is only about 1 1/2 hrs from Shanghai and the tour buses leave from Shanghai stadium. A top tip - you might need some help in buying the tickets unless your Chinese is great. Another highlight was a trip to the Propaganda Poster Arts Museum. It can be a bit difficult to find but once you get there, it's very interesting. I will definitely go back to Shanghai again but most likely will stay somewhere a bit more central."
12,2300,"Nov 10 2006 	Great and a bit different !	Stayed for 6 nights on a leisure break in October 2006.Was a bit apprehensive as this brand was not a known quantity, however I needn't have worried.Location is slightly out of centre, to the south west of the main attractions, but the hotel is very accessible to metro station (2 mins walk), and cabs are easy to get. I think the location is a plus point as it means you get much better value than a comparable place in a tourist location.The building itself, within Shanghai Stadium, is very impressive.My wife and I stayed in a Regal Club room (there was a special offer on the hotel website of USD 130 per night). This entitled us to check-in on the 'club' (12th) floor, and meant we were entitled to free breakfast, evening drinks and canapes, and various other extras. I would highly recommend booking this class of room.The club lounge had an excellent view over the stadium, we were lucky that there was a pop concert on the first night of our stay - very interesting !Our room was very large, clean, with all the facilities to be expected of a 4-star property. The decoration was a bit old fashioned for our taste, I would have preferred something a bit more contemporary. Not a major problem, however, and everything was in good condition. Bed was very hard, I actually like that, but be warned if you like a soft mattress.We did not dine at the hotel except to take the complimentary breakfast and canapes, however these were of good quality. The drinks were also a bonus - basically a full bar from which you could help yourself - quite easy to overdo it !All staff at the hotel were great, very polite, excellent English, and extremely helpful. They booked us restaurants, trips, cabs, the works.In short, I would not hesitate to stay here again, don't let the apparent 'remote' location put you off.PS Some friends of ours booked one of the cheapest rooms - it was OK but pretty small and a bit tatty - I would def recommend a higher class room."
13,2300,"Oct 30 2006 	loved the hotel	going to shanaghai to visit our daughter who was working there. booked this 4* hotel for four nights, on 6th october, fabulous price of 97 pounds sterling room only, for 2 people. did not expect much at this price very pleasantly surprised. gorgeous hotel. staff excellent. accommodation first-class. did not have time to use their excellent leisure facilities. hotel located very near the metro. which is very convenient and extremely cheap - about 28 pence to the bund, and other places of interest. definitely recommend."
14,2300,"Oct 14 2006 	Very nice hotel	This is a very nice hotel. Our room was very comfortable, good ammenities. All staff were very helpful. Pool and hot tub area are nice - close by 9:30 PM. Be careful not to confuse this hotel with the Regal INTERNATIONAL East Asia Hotel which is located in the French concession and closer to the city center. This is a great hotel if you will be flying out of Hong Qiao Airport (only took about 20 minutes to get there.) But, otherwise it is a bit far from the major attractions. Metro stops are placed quite far apart in Shanghai. The hotel is actually attached to the stadium - (makes it easier for cab drivers to find). You can get to the hotel from Pudong airport using public transport (mag lev to green metro line, change at people's square to red line - exit metro to the left and walk about 5-10 min.) but, if you have luggage we would recommend taking a taxi. They do offer miles but room rate has to be at least 700 CYN. We booked on the internet for $57. Overall, we were very happy here, especially for such a good rate and would stay again especially if flying out of HongQaio."
15,2300,"Jun 15 2006	Great Hotel and Value!	Although The Regal Shanghai East Asia Hotel is a 3 star hotel, I found it much much better than the 4 star hotel I stayed at in Beijing (the Swissotel). Reasons I liked the Regal Shanghai East Asia Hotel: my room and bathroom were clean; the room size was lager than I expected for a standard room; the room was decorated in a modern and simple yet elegant way; the staff was friendly and spoke English well; the subway is just around the corner and up the block; not far from most attractions by subway. I cannot think of a complaint about it really..."

1,2301,Nov 15 2009 	Very good price but not the best location	If your travels take you to Shanghai and you plan to travel to locations around the city on this side of the river this place is convenient. If you want to be in the city center and walk to places of interest this is not the place to stay. I stayed here 4 yrs ago and last week again - and while the rooms are in nice shape the hotel itself is off the beaten track and has no local feel to it. Just not much going on here. The room rate was really low - like $75/night - which is a big value in Shanghai for a Marriott property. The JW Tommorrow's Square property wanted $300+ on the same week. The lobby and bars are nicely appointed and are modern and clean. The room was in nice shape too but I didnt feel that comfortable walking around near the building. Lots of local hustle and bustle - not many foreigners though out and about. This place is highly comfortable and functional but you don't get any flavor for the city staying here.	
2,2301,Oct 30 2009 	Cutting Cost on Customers	Hotel uses saving evironmental as an excuse to trip their own cost by halving and eleminate the supply of basic amenities set in the rooms. Everything you want like an extra pair of slippers
3,2301,Sep 29 2009 	Great service great restaurants and wonderful rooms	The rooms were nice and spacious
4,2301,Sep 21 2009 	Simply great!	Just a great place
5,2301,Sep 20 2009 	Comfortable and very big rooms	Comfortable and very big rooms. Location is ok: about 10 minutes walk from the nearest MTR station that takes you into Shanghai centre. Few small shops nearby.	
6,2301,Sep 1 2009 	Fits the bill	Clean
7,2301,Aug 23 2009 	Felt very comfortable here	Travelled to Shanghai recently on business and stayed here for a week. The hotel decor is very stylish throughout - modern
8,2301,Jul 30 2009	Good Hotel if not for the smell	The bed was comfy and room looked nice. It even had 2 phone lines so my mom &amp; I can both talk to difference folks back home at the same time. The problem I had was that the room smelled like yhe sewer
9,2301,May 23 2009 	Classy  comfortable and luxiorous	1) Very Close to the Exhibition Centre in Pudong2) Comfortable and Luxirious Rooms3) Excellent Breakfast spread4) Great Lobby5) Good serviceThe bloch to the whole experience was 
10,2301,Apr 23 2009 	A good hotel in a bad position	The hotel itself was very very good and for overnight visitors that need a hotel close to the airport it would be a good place to stay. However
11,2301,Apr 21 2009 	hate to tell people this is a nice hotel bcz it's going to drive up the price	i've been staying at this hotel around 5 times a year since its opening. agree to most of the recent comments listed here. don't quite understand the one saying this hotel is only a four star by american standards - i have never seen a nicer renaissance in the states - maybe i've been going to the &quot;wrong&quot; places.true
12,2301,Apr 21 2009 	Great experience Renaissance	I stayed for 4 nights in Renaissance
13,2301,Sep 21 2008 	Great Business Hotel	One of the best Renaissance hotels I have stayed at in China. It is a bit out of the way - surrounded by residential area - however taxis are easy to come by and quite cheap. Also Metro line 2 is about a 15 minute walk (Shanghai Science and Technology Museum station). Also there is a large shopping area (Xiangyang Market) in the metro station similar to Silk Market in Beijing with copies of western brands. On the same Metro line 2 you can go across river to heart of Bund area (Nanjing Road) in about 15 minutes for a couple of dollars. Faster and less expensive than taxi.Hotel still looks quite new
14,2301,Aug 20 2008 	Fantastic	Stunning Marriott Hotel on the Eastern side of Shanghai. Staff at every point were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Beautifully appointed public rooms
15,2301,Jun 21 2008 	Beautiful central Shanghai hotel!	This is a beautiful Marriott property! I would rate it a 9 in the US.I stayed here for 16 days in May June of 2008 and it was a beautiful hotel.The rooms are spacious and the beds new and luxurious. 6 pillows and I had an excellent view of the park and city.I was here on business and had a few days off for pleasure. You can walk everywhere and taxis are cheap. Be careful of the taxis outside their areas they are totally confused and lost!! We learned this the hard way and got lost several times.Make sure to get a hotel card from the concierge as it will be your only hope back in a taxi!They have good maps and can help a lot but get detailed instructions in Chinese and have them circle the destination and the hotel for the trip.We visited the club lounge daily for high quality happy hour and great food stuff. The team in the club lounge bend over backwards to please and wait hand and foot on clients. There is excellent wired and wireless internet that seems to be free and unrestricted. I was able to connect to all my usual US sites without any problems. The hotel is beautifully decorated.Beware the lobby bar lounge though. We went down often and saw ladies of the evening working the crowd hard for business. It was obvious the staff were well aware and chummed up to the girls between their rounds to the often intoxicated business mens rooms. My friends and I saw this every night in the lounge.They tried us as well but we just ignored them so they left us alone after the second night. The food is pretty good in the lounge but the alcohol is outrageous. 7-9 USD per drink or beer.Across the street at the Family Mart you can get water
16,2301,Apr 6 2008 	Nice but thin veneer	The Renaissance Pudong is a nice
17,2301,Feb 9 2008 	quite even on New Years Eve	Having spent 8 nights on hard Chinese beds in the western part of China
18,2301,Jan 22 2008 	Enjoyed my stay	I was in Shanghai for business in August. This hotel was recommended to me by coworkers. The hotel had a nice interior and my room was spacious. The hotel was staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel is in the newer part of Shanghai. For business
19,2301,Nov 30 2007 	A Nice Hotel in a Decent Location	The Renaissance Shanghai Pudong is a nice hotel
20,2301,Apr 2 2007 	Very nice hotel	This is a very nice hotel
21,2301,Apr 1 2007 	Great hotel	We stayed at the hotel for two nights during a recent multi-city tour of China. It was an excellent experience. The rooms were very large clean
22,2301,Sep 25 2006 	Nice Hotel but beware the rip-off internet	I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in Mid September. It is very nice and plush
23,2301,Aug 10 2006	Great in many ways	Stayed there on business. 5 star quality. Located in residential area so minimal traffic and crowds. Never waited more than 1 minute for taxi unlike other hotels. Primo room decor and modern fixtures
24,2301,Jul 22 2006 	My new favorite place to stay in the Shanghai area	Gorgeous lobby
25,2301,Jul 1 2006 	A great stay	I just returned from a week in Shanghai where I stayed at the Reniasance Shanghai Pudong. This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at in Asia.The room on the club floor was large and well designed with plenty of closet space
26,2301,Jun 1 2006	Best hotel I found in China	We spent only one night
27,2301,May 21 2006	Good Hotel in a quiet area	Great Hotel located in the not yet developed Pudong area
28,2301,May 12 2006 	5 Star Service- You get what you pay for	This place definitely lives up to eloquence of it's lobby decor. The breakfast buffet is much better than other western hotels in Shanghai and the wait staff will catch your napkin before it hits the floor. The rooms are beautiful
29,2301,Mar 16 2006	Most Memorable Feature: Grand Lobby...	This hotel lived up to expectations of what was expected of a 5 star chain hotel. The bathroom was huge relative to size of bedroom. Decor was oriental themed calligraphy with liberal splashes of red and gold. The bed was comfortable and turndown service included a cookie as well as the weather forecast for the following day. However
30,2301,Oct 17 2005	Lovely Hotel	As some ppl stated that the location is not the best but the hotel itself is really nice. Nice decor
31,2301,Aug 5 2005 	Amazing Hotel	This hotel may not be the most convienient if you want access to the city
32,2301,Apr 17 2005 	Luxury and a bit of peace in busy Shanghai	Got this hotel on a $85 Priceline bid -- not the best deal that I've gotten on Priceline but...this hotel was so worth it and more! It was luxury as soon as you walk in through the doors. Check in was a breeze and the bellhop helped me transport my lugguage to the room. Service was superior and professional. Loved the bathrooms (separate shower and tub) and the toiletries provided. The room was spacious and the beds were fabulous with a comfy duvet. Internet access was available but it worked only on 1 night out of the 2 nights I was there. Hotel restaurant had a nice breakfast buffet. But I opted to eat off the menu instead. Really liked their Chinese breakfast. For dinner
33,2301,Feb 20 2005	Wonderful Luxury Hotel Away From The Hustle 	Fantastic hotel. Stayed on the club floor for a rate of $95 over Chinese New Year - rate included breakfast buffet and evening canopes and drinks. Free internet and laundry. Room beautifully decorated with a fusion of western and eastern themes - luxurious bathroom
34,2301,Feb 2 2005	Definately recommend this hotel!	First trip to Shanghai and stayed at the Renaissance Pudong for 3 weeks in January
35,2301,Oct 26 2004	Great hotel taxi to the center	Stayed in this luxurious hotel with my wife and my parents in September 2004. The hotel is great (rooms
36,2301,Jul 7 2004	Very nice business hotel	Very comfortable and large rooms. In a new residential area -- have to take taxi to restaurants

1,2304,The bed is good and also the clublounge service	The title say's about all what is better then average I normally experience. the staff was very helpfull and friendly. Stayed here for one night. Stayed in more hotels in Shanghai with about the same (company)-rate as this hotel and have to state this is my last stay here. I took the clublounge upgrade for reason same price as seperate additional internet + breakfast + lounge-promotion-stuff. The building is clearly from the older architecture style of Hotel-building. There is no separate shower (in bathtub with curtain) and the room was not spacy. Location good for starting travel west for Suzhou or evening stuff in Puxi.
2,2304,"Jun 11 2009 	VEry Nice Hotel	Stayed for 2 nights at the Renaissance hotel in the middle of the Shanghai business district in Sep 2007.The location is fantastic and the rooms were great. The staff and their service was also very good.They tool care of me well considering this was my first trip to Shaighai.Breakfast buffet spread was huge and tasty as well.The rooms were bright and clean. The gym facility was fully functional and useful with good stock of towels and water.We orderd pizza in room service when we wanted something quick and to our surprise it tasted so delicious, we ended up ordering more of the same."
3,2304,"May 13 2009 	Speedways to Progress!	I moved to the Renaissance Yangtze Hotel as it was just across my Business Associates' Offices. Breakfast was not included in the price &amp; was quite expensive, though good. The view of the Speedways and speeding traffic was something. Showed what China was all about. The foot massage lady was great. She also comes to the Room if you want.Rooms were really nice and staff was good. Seems like the Management was very good at training their staff."
4,2304,"Apr 27 2009 	Exhibition centre	Some hotels near to exhibition centres can be &quot;well used&quot; and &quot;jaded&quot;, but not this one.The Renaissance offers sumptuous beds and very quiet rooms. Everywhere is perfectly clean and well maintained. The restaurants are very well serviced and all the staff are very friendly and helpful. After long, tiring days at the nearby exhibition centre, this hotel is a treat to savour.If you are thinking of shopping at one of the nearby shopping malls, make sure that you have a large limit on your credit card. The goods may carry a very well known European or Japanese brand name, but they also carry a very high price tag. Curiously, the hotel's own shop has some attractive souvenirs to offer, and they will readily accept the principle of bargaining. Just be prepared to spend some time to reach a final price!"
5,2304,"Apr 18 2009 	Comfortable City Hotel	I stayed for one week on business, but managed a couple of personal days for sightseeing.Checkin at mid-day was fast and pleasant: I took the club upgrade, which entitles you to breakfast, and 'happy hour' for free drinks and nibbles in the evening, in the penthouse amongst other perks. Refreshments in the lobby were rather expensive, even for a 4/5 star hotel. My room was well appointed with a kingsize bed, LCD TV and en-suite. I was hosted by colleagues from my company all week so did not have a chance to try the hotel's restaurants. I used the pool and sauna twice, and inspected the gym: all very good.Across the road (under the elevated roadway) to the right is an oasis of tranquility called the New Town Central Park where, on a nice day, you can relax as you stroll round for an hour or so. The hotel is within easy walking distance of some large shopping malls. There are taxis at the entrance to take you downtown at a reasonable rate.Staff were all very pleasant and courteous, and contributed to my very enjoyable stay."
6,2304,"Feb 21 2008	Disappoint	Stay this hotel again at last Nov for business trip, my last stay was in mid-2005. Feel this hotel getting worse than worse! Check in at mid-night, but no greeting by check-in staff....the breakfast service is worse, also Chinese restaurant expensive but service and food far behind than before... Talk to their restaurant staff, ineresting they said the ex-food and beverage manager from Hong Kong was gone to other hotel, then the standard is dropping down. Is this excuse for the customers? I won't recommend to my friends!"
7,2304,"Jan 24 2008 	good business hotel	stay here for business purpose onlyhongqiao area is far from tourist and real shanghai areasis a new development that looks like any other western cityif first and only visit to shanghai stay at the bund areanormal clean rooms nothing fancy good buffet breakfastgubei area is near with lots of restaurants and supermarket (taxi)walking distance you hace a food street ,also new with many western choices (Mc,starb,hoot etc)if there stop in front of sheraton building and grab something from Zoes cafeteria,very good value in coffe and lunch"
8,2304,"Nov 5 2007 	Great retreat from the busy streets of Shanghai	We stayed in a club level room for six nights and this hotel made Shanghai much more enjoyable for us. As first time travelers (from the US) to China, we suffered from culture shock at times while we were in Shanghai, but it was always a pleasure to come back to the Renaissance.Our room was comfortable and fairly modern. We took advantage of the good-sized mini-fridge to store a few groceries which we had purchased from the foreigner-friendly Friendship Store across the street from the hotel.We found that having access to the club was key, as that included an easy and filling breakfast (with lots of Western style food choices) each day, and drinks throughout the day. When we did eat at the main hotel restaurant a couple times, the food was quite good but also very expensive.The service provided by the concierge was impeccable. We relied on them quite often to write our destination in Mandarin so that we could communicate with the taxi drivers. All the employees of the hotel whom we met spoke very good English.This hotel's location is a bit out of the center of the city, but it's not bad at all. We found that taxi rides to the Bund, People's Square, etc. typically took about 20-30 minutes. Great hotel; decent location; the perfect retreat from Shanghai's chaotic streets."
9,2304,Nov 3 2007 	Comfortable and Stylish at the Renaissance	I was here at the tail end of a 2 week business trip. The hotel is quite near our office here so a logical choice. The room was very nice - extra comfy bed (best one on the trip) with plenty of pillows.The bathroom amenities all had an Asian smell (lemongrass) which was really nice as well. The gym was pretty good - decent equipment and personal TVs at each one. The weights were ok - enough to tide me over. I agree with the other reviewer - the breakfasts were amazing -great selection of pastries - very nice - and they had the typical omelet station and Asian/Indian/Japanese on top of the Western fare.Food was a little pricey (by Shanghai standards) but not unexpected for a top end hotel.
10,2304,"Oct 24 2007 	Very nice hotel  helpful and courteous staff but pillows were smelly of rancid	This was a good hotel. I was assigned to the wrong room with an occupant. I went back to the desk, the manager apologised but no compensation. Room was OK and neat but pillows stank with rancid sweat. I was too tired to complain and slept and left the next morning.Breakfast was OK - standard fare.A bit remote"
11,2304,"Aug 6 2007 	Excellent Hotel	I recently stayed at the Shanghai Renaissance. The rooms were very nice and the staff was very helpful. The room was large and well appointed. The bathroom was also roomy.The buffet served a variety of western food for both breakfast, lunch and dinner. During the evening they had a string quartet play in the lobby which was a nice touch.The concierge helped us book a tour of Shanghai. Get a personal guide it is worth the money."
12,2304,"Jul 19 2007 	great hotel clean rooms	Very clean and modern hotel. Breakfast buffet was extensive with american and asian offerings. Hotel staff was formal and helpful. Location is not convenient to where we wanted to be, but I will definitely stay there again."
13,2304,Oct 16 2006 	Consistently Good hotel	Stayed recently again. Only after asking did I realise its a short walk to Intex and Shanghai Mart expo hallsExcellent service throughout from arrival to checkout. Breakfast is good and the bar pleasant. Rooms are well appointed with good beds and showers. Minor grumble about the Aircon thermostat buzzing as it switched on &amp; off. The Sushi restaurant while good is expensive so you choose and the other eteries are fine and upto the standard of many hotels.Its a bit out of town so about 1 hour by car to PVG while Hongchow [sic] is pretty close. Taxi into central ~30 rmb or 15 mins ishGood gym &amp; pool if you have time.
14,2304,"May 4 2006 	Renaissance reflected	Just returned from a week long stay at this hotel.The food was wonderful!, especially so the bread and pasteries which were better than Paris!The breakfast buffet was excellent with western, eastern and some 'in between' dishes.The location is a bit more remote from the Bund, but the taxis are cheeep, and getting around with signs in both Mandarin and English is helpful.Shopping is not 'centralized' in Shanghai ,as the Hongquia pearl market is proximally located to the hotel.The spa is well equipted and relaxing ,with both cold &amp; hot plunge pools along with the requisite sauna &amp; steam rooms.The management, especially Robert the Food Service Manager ,were excellent in assisting with food choices both in house ,as well as the excellent surrounding Dining choices.Intend to return to Shanghai ,as well as the Renaisance Yangtze, in the not too distant future."
15,2304,"Mar 6 2006 	shower tempurature problem	comfortable bed, good/friendly staff, small room, small bath, shower temperature changes every 1 minute, long taxi queue during commute hours (there is no public transportation around, and with its location, you pretty much have to take taxi anywhere to/from the hotel.)"
16,2304,"Jan 3 2006 	Good gym the sell is the comfy rooms.	This hotel is not in the city center but in Shanghai, cabs are so cheap that staying away from the crowd can be a wise choice. The hotel has a great gym (free), opens early at 5:30am, and the spa is pretty good. The breakfast is one of the best ones. They have Chinese, Japanese and great American breakfast food, lots of fresh pre-cut fruits for a hotel breakfast. The rooms are very nice and modern, they are not over the top and are very efficiently designed. It makes you feel like home after a few days. The Executive floor lounge has a very nice happy-hour selection of beer, wine, snacks (hot and cold)and sweets. The hotel restaurants are okay but definitely eat out if possible. Overall, 3 times of staying there have been a positive experience."
17,2304,"Jun 7 2005	soft coccon	I have stayed here numerous times, the last time in May 2005. Always felt a sense of being cared for there. Great new pillows and comforters. The pastry shop in the lobby is great, for snacks or a simple breakfast. Slightly off location, and one side of the building is next to the freeway."
18,2304,"Jan 4 2005	really enjoyed my stay at the Renaissance	Stayed at the hotel for 7 nights on a business trip in November '04 -- very nice environment, staff, comfortable rooms and accommodations. Had regular room service breakfast: one morning they were 10 min late, and I noted same to the manager: got complimentary breakfast the following morning, as well as a plate of fruit and chocolates. Hotel is close to shopping, other large hotels, and to Starbucks !! One down note: rush-hour taxi line is too long, both in the morning and in the evening -- plan ahead for a car."

1,2305,Sep 22 2009 	Pleasant rooms in a good location	Having read previous reviews I was very concerned that the tour group we were with had booked this hotel. They assured us it was good quality and we were relieved to find it was. The rooms were clean with modern decor - we stayed in two different rooms and both were fine. The bed was large and comfy and the bathroom had all lots of nice marble and glass. The hotel is located near a busy road but this makes for good connections with the main attractions. The only thing that was less than perfect was the breakfast area which was hectic although it did have a good range of Western and Oriental food.
2,2305,"Jan 26 2009 	Hated the place	Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. It's got everything that could spell accommodation NIGHTMARE.We were hit with stench of some terrible odor which lasted from the hotel lobby to our room corridor.Disinterested waitress who chat amongst themselves with stale, overcooked buffet breakfast greet us in the morning.Was just sitting around hotel lobby, reading guide book bought from Sydney, got bitten by mosquitoes that hangs around hotel lobby and accused of stealing the guide book by the gift shop assistant.Many times we had to stop the maid from cleaning our room when we clearly put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on our door. We complained to the reception about this, then the same night , I got bitten by BED BUGS and couldn't sleep the entire night.Would avoid this place like the plague.It's a shame Australian management has stooped to such a low level!"
3,2305,"Dec 9 2008	Wonders of China Tour	Shanghai:Rendezvous Merry Hotel - &quot;Appalling.&quot;A TripAdvisor Member, Liverpool, U.K.Stayed at this hotel in the finale of a 'Wonders of China Tour.'Have been back in the U.K. for 2-weeks and we are still trying to get over food poisoning.The lobby, a vast open unappealing area, was draughty and cold.Our hotel room and bathroom, though somewhat cramped, was clean and presentable.By far the worst part of the hotel is it's restaurant. A breeding ground for bacteria. It is probably the worst hotel restaurant we have been to in any part of the world. The buffet style food is presented in large containers kept warm for hours on end by 2-candles beneath each of the containers. Many of the candles had burnt themselves out and were not replaced. At best, the food was only ever lukewarm. The thought of it still makes us shudder. The chefs (if that is what you could call them!) did not wear hats. All of the restaurant staff appeared totally disinterested. They just chatted amongst themselves.Overall, our impression is that management is poor and there needs to be root and branch overhaul of employee practices and restaurant hygeine.My wife and I will never stay at one on these chain of hotels ever again. This hotel alone spoilt our 6-week holiday to Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, and China."
4,2305,"Apr 23 2008 	An excellent hotel	I recently stayed at this hotel for one week on a business trip to China. The hotel was booked by my company; I had no say in the matter and in fact it was not the company's first choice for my stay.No matter. I found it perfectly clean and comfortable, and it certainly lived up to its' rating. Admittedly the location is not so good from the tourist's point of view, but without wishing to seem selfish I was in China on business and not for tourism.But for those tourists who make the effort to work out the vagaries of the Shanghai underground, the nearest Metro station (Jiangsu Rd) is only about 10 - 15 mins walk away. Taxis are not too difficult to get - no more difficult than anywhere else in Shanghai.I did not dine there but I did have the buffet breakfast every day. I found this to be excellent. My only criticism was when I asked for a bag to be placed in the room so I could send some clothes to the laundry. In fact they actually took the clothes which I had left out and had them laundered, which included some I didn't want to be included - but that was hardly the crime of the century!I would certainly recomend this hotel to others and I would stay there again"
5,2305,Jan 10 2008 	really a conference hotel	Stayed in this hotel after a long tour of china staying in a variety of hotels 3* to 5* .The Hotel is as other people have said a bit out of the way for the bund and shopping etc But taxis are easy to get and cheap.it is near the expressway but so is every hotel in shanghai ! The rooms were clean and had all the facillitys but by most hotel standards very small .Ok for one nighters but not as a base.This hotel caters mainly for conferences so is a bit impersonel but the staff were fine ane spoke better english than i spoke chinese.Food was ok i recommend the breakfast but other meals a bit motel style .The worst part was the bar .It was VERY expensive and carried a 15% surcharge on everything ! you were better off getting a taxi and going to a local bar street (Blue Frog Nanyong street 10mins away 60p fare )where most of the europeans drank .friendly atmosphere and CHEAP !!The overall view of this Hotel is that its OK but there are better about
6,2305,"Dec 3 2007	Had to move after one night	This hotel is in the worst location, has the worst &quot;restaurants&quot; of any hotel I've stayed in, noone speaks English, and it took so long to get the smell of the hotel out of my clothes."
7,2305,"Oct 28 2007 	Good hotel	This is a very good hotel but a little away from the &quot;action&quot;. You need a cab, bus or the metro to get to the main attractions. The staff are not really all that friendly but they are very efficient. The breakfasts are very good but don't bother eating any other meal as the service and the food are not that good.The hotel is very clean and the rooms are nice for the price.They &quot;ran out&quot; of white wine (yes the entire hotel had no white wine for 2 evenings)Worth the price though. Depends on what you want. It's safe, clean and reasonably central."
8,2305,"Jul 20 2007	Modern Hotel for A Big City	Top notch hotel geared for business travelers and tourists alike (first hotel we used in China that had an iron in the room). Clean, comfortable, well equipped. Can't say anything negative, except as a tourist, it might be helpful to stay at a hotel closer to the Bund since we were always taking taxis down to that area. We used the subway in Shanghai as well - fantastic, clean, easy to use (maps, fares), lots of posts in English. A little confusing on the street to find our way back to hotel, but we eventually made it. Breakfast top notch as well, Western and Asian buffet, good service, very minimal box breakfast if you have to leave early (not even any butter with the rolls, which were at least fresh)."
9,2305,"Mar 28 2007 	This is a MOTEL not a HOTEL!	This place calls itself a 5-star hotel, in reality, its more like a motel. The front entrance and the lobby looked modern, but the rooms are terrible. Their Chinese dinner restaurant consisted of 7 odd sized tables with almost no ventilation in a room no larger than 300 sq. feet. Since my family and I are non-smokers, the second-hand smoke we endured sure made me think of lung cancer. The driveway exiting the hotel is very dangerous, heavy with pedestrian/bicycle/scooter/vehicle traffic, each time we drove out we came close to getting into an accident. My travel agent has been notified not to recommend this hotel to others."
10,2305,Jan 17 2007	a really bad mistake	we booked an executive suite for 5 nights.the room was dark and uninviting.it had a vile smell.the couch and bed were so hard it was impossible to get comfortable.the food in the lounge was cold. we checked out after 1 night .reception did not as why we were checking out early so we felt that just summed up the place they obviously have enough customers so they dont need to care
11,2305,"Dec 5 2006	Smelly room	We booked this hotel in December 2006 for five nights as part of a holiday in China but only stayed one night. Our room smelled of mould and urine. Hotel staff were competent but not overly helpful. When we asked to change rooms they gave us a key to the new room but did not offer to move our bags despite my partner having a fractured arm in a sling from a fall from a few days before. When I asked for a tourist map the receptionist laughed or rather sneered. It is an Australian run hotel with Australian prices (high for China) and Australian service standards (mediocre to poor). After inquiring about nearby restaurants to eat at and being told that there were some about twenty minutes walk away, we decided to have a meal in the hotel bar. The menu was standard Australian pub food - chips, burgers, tuna sandwiches etc. A tuna sandwich and a burger with two beers set us back 388 yuan or about $70. The hotel is next to a very busy and noisy expressway. I am not sure if it is central but it is about a 30 minute taxi ride from the Bund and Nanjing Road East which is not ideal from a tourist's point of view. It is a good place to stay if you want to watch English language television or want to converse with the many Australians who stay there but you might be better off doing that in Australia."
12,2305,"Mar 16 2006 	Exceeded my expectations...Value for $$	Though this hotel might not be 5-stars,I am still giving an &quot;Excellent&quot; rating because for the price I paid relative to other centrally located hotels (big-chain). This was a steal. This hotel is rather centrally located and well kept. Room was clean and orderly. Though I found the bathroom a little cramp (they included both a shower and bathtub) but that was not a big deal. Bathroom amenities though rather standard were sufficient and they even had a rain shower! Truly relaxing after a long day of sightseeing etc. Hotel also provided 2 bottles of drinking water a day, which came in handy.During my 3 nights stay, I managed to get a good rate inclusive of breakfast which served to make my stay even sweeter. =) If you can, do request for a room facing the city as those views are nicer and the rooms are a tad brighter and bigger!As in most parts of China, cabs are cheap and plentiful so it was convenient getting from place to place. Will definitely consider staying here again."
13,2305,"Mar 4 2006	Super Hotel. Great Value	What a lovely hotel this is. OK, not quite as good as the Hilton in Shanghai, but it's a chinese hotel and you really would have to split hairs to tell the differance. We only stayed 2 nights (38 for a double room) elegant, very friendly, lovely breakfast (included in the price)very clean. Large room with Kingsize bed. Bathroom is lovely, all the extras that you would need. Extreamly central. But a taxi is only 60p within a two mile radius and the porter just calls one for you."
14,2305,"Aug 9 2005 	Good Home Away From Home	Stayed at the Rendezvous for one night in July. Actually this was my 5th visit to this hotel. The location for me is excellent since it is near my source of business but some may find it not as convenient. The rooms are spotless, everything works and the breakfast buffet wonderful. The staff is pleasant, solicitous and very helpful. The air conditioning worked well which is an important consideration for Shanghai in July. There is plenty of traffic around the hotel but the rooms are quiet and the traffic is not heard. A good night's sleep was the result. We shall return."

1,2306,Apr 2 2009 	Average at best.	- Okey rooms. Fairly Average.- Nothing Amazing
2,2306,Mar 13 2009 	hidden gem of a hotel	I stayed here for a couple of nights during a business trip. It's pretty close to the Hangquo airport. It took about 20 minutes by car from the airport to the hotel. The hotel's located in a pretty busy area
3,2306,Jan 23 2009 	Nice choice for slightly off the beaten path in Shanghai	We stayed here a single night for a business trip. The location was about a 1.5 hour drive in 6PM Shanghai traffic from the Pudong Airport. The rooms were clean and with very modern styling. Many western channels are available on the TVs
4,2306,Jul 10 2008	Great hotel soso location	The rooms were in good condition
5,2306,Jun 28 2008	Absolutely Fabulous	This was the first hotel we stayed in on our trip to China with Grand Circle Travel. This hotel is an amazing hotel. The rooms are top shelf (meaning great) and the service was the best I have ever experienced. I think the only part of the hotel that did not look like a million dollars was the stairwell that I walked up an down a few times for exercise one day (this was a service stairwell and guests would rarely see it unless they were crazy like me in need of a work-out). The beds were comfortable. The rooms were emasculate. The restaurants had excellent food and service. Right around the corner from the hotel is a huge Chinese supermarket from which we purchased some snacks to ease our food budget. In the mornings people from the surrounding neighborhood congregated in the court outside the market by the hotel for Tai Chi. The only thing that could make this hotel even better would be if it could be transplanted nearer the Bund or other tourist sites. However
6,2306,Sep 20 2007	Very good hotel	We had a very enjoyable stay in the Royalton Hotel. The room was excellent and the resturant was superb. Resturant staff did have problems understanding English when you got away from ordering the meal
7,2306,"Jul 6 2007 	A ""sleeper""...going local was a great experience	local friend suggested the hotel...it was great. Staff was friendly; reasonably good English; great facilities"
8,2306,Jun 24 2007 	Nice room with very bad service	Their restaurant offered very nice food
9,2306,Apr 3 2006 	Excellent up to date business hotel	I stayed at the Royalton for a business conference so the location was not really by choice. The Royalton is located in the western part of Shanghai
1,2309,Nov 2 2009 	In the heart of Huangpu District	In the heart of Huangpu District. Easy access to all the interesting points.
2,2309,"Oct 23 2009 	Great Location highly recommend.	Hotel is very clean and you get free internet in the room. We stayed at the business suite and it came with a computer as well, not sure about the other rooms. The decor is very over the top chinese style furnishing. Bed is quite comfortable. The large bathtub is a small plus.The restaurant is below expectations. Definitely do not count on great food if you plan on dining in the hotel. I'd suggest you take the short walk to Nanjing Rd, where there's plenty to choose. We tried the breakfast buffet and would definitely not recommend it. It cost RMB$90 (around $13 US) and it was terrible. You can get way better food elsewhere for a fraction of that.Hotel is very well located. Most of the main Shanghai attractions are within walking distance. Nanjing Rd (10-15 min. walk), Bund (15-20 min. walk), YuYuan Garden (20-30 min. walk), People square (15-20 min. walk). The Nanjing Rd East Subway station is only 5-10 min. walk and you can take the subway to almost any location. Getting in from Pudong Int'l Airport, we took a taxi and came out to RMB$186, and about 75 min ride. If you don't have much luggage, it's faster to take the MagLev Train to the Longham station (RMB$50), then take the Subway Metro 2 (RMB$4) to the Nanjing Rd East station, walk up exit 3 and turn left as you exit the station. Then just walk down about 3-4 blocks (about 10-15 min.) and the hotel will be at the intersection with Guangdong rd. Definitely recommend this hotel for the price. BTW, we paid around $79 / night."
3,2309,"Oct 19 2009 	Reasonable location 	Stayed for 4 nights in executive suite on 25th floor. Any commentary has to be aware of the rating and for 5 star one can get a little picky. We booked online and paid about US$500 for the 4 nights total.Staff are friendy for a Chinese run hotel (which is often not the case).On arrival we were ushered to the 31st florr for VIP checkin which was a little strage as there was nobody waiting in the foyer. But all went smoothly and efficiently to get us into the room in super quick time.It has two older style TVs, nice big bed and separate TV / coimputer / louge area. No that big but quite sufficient. The PC provided has reasonable speed for basic work and quite functional. I found mysilf using it rather then the laptop. Reasonable view through the fog (nobody likes calling it pollution as such).Make sure you bring your own shampoo as both of us found teh one small container supplied was worse then soap. They also have no conditioner supplied which was also a little annoying given the bad quality of the shampoo.there is a local English paper in the foyer which is worth a quick read.It was impossible to get a rate online that included breakfast so the first morning we did try it out and it was quite OK but we could not get out heads around the 90RMB price tag. There are many cafes and restaurants nearby where you can experionce some local Chinese flavour for much much less.Its a short wallk to the walking street (East Nanjing) which is worth the trip and there are many good restaurants around there also. Don't jump into the ones at street level which will be overpirced but venture up a few levels for reasonable value and good quality.Otherwise you can grab a taxi (min 12RMB) which will zip (except for the incredible traffic) you to the other major sites of old town (fairly close), Pudong, etc.Overall I would stay here again asl long at the rates were at a 4 star level."
4,2309,"Sep 27 2009 	Greta Location - good value	Stayed at Salvo many many times and whilst the hotel is getting a bit tired the location next to the Bund and Nanjing Road cannot be beaten for the price.Try and get an upgrade to upper floor as the views can be superb. Don't expect large rooms - but they are big enough Excellent top floor bar, but don't bother with the hotel restaurants as they leave a lot to be desired. Execption to that is the Japanese on the gound floor. Staff are pretty good and helpful, but not overly so"
5,2309,Sep 26 2009 	Excellent Hotel - 5* low priced hotel + Excellent location	Stayed at the Salvo Hotel on September 24. I stayed in a business queen suite which consists of a bedroom and an office room. Excellent hotel with an oriental influence. Located 2 minutes away from Nanjing Road. Rates very affordable compared to other hotels in Shanghai (paid approximately $100 USD). Will be my hotel for all future trips in Shanghai.
6,2309,"Aug 30 2009 	Great location.	Stayed here for two nights. Rooms were large - actually a business suite but very reasonable - booked through Expedia. Big bonus was the internet available in the room. Bathroom very clean not overly large but separate shower - very fancy and a corner bath. Furniture a little old fashioned in appearance with a slight Chinese flavour (well it is China), two TV'S. Were on the 17th floor with a great view of the river. Location was super, just a few minutes walk to The Bund (unfortunately a building site due to Expo 2010) and Nanjing Road. Staff were polite, courteous and informative, particularly the bell boys. Great value for money in Shanghai."
7,2309,"Aug 15 2009 	Good value great location	The Salvo Hotel (what a fantastic name!) is very well located in central Shanghai and is very close to the Bund and the Old Town. It is a local Chinese-owned and operated hotel and thus guests shouldn't expect Western-style decor - there were lots of gold carp in my room! Having said that, all the staff I met spoke good English. Service in general was fast and efficient. The room had all the basics, CNN, and a very good internet connection. Overall, I would stay here again. Its good value for money and is very well located."
8,2309,"Aug 10 2009 	Good hotel I would recommend it to a good friend	Loved the hotel, good English speaking staff, location close to many touristic places (although it is located in an old area in Shanghai, maybe if you want a really modern place you could stay across the river in Pudong area).Nice suite with a living room and a separate bedroom. Big bath tube and separate shower with lots of controls. We had a computer (yes, they provide a computer for guests) with free internet (a MUST have in hotels nowadays and specially in China)!The western restaurant menu was not so attractive (and a little expensive compared to China standards). I would recommend getting things from the room service instead: more options and cheaper! Also, check the best prices for the drinks from the room service and the minibar, they are different!We booked this hotel through the booking.com website and got the VIP check-in on the 31st floor."
9,2309,"Jul 26 2009 	Excellent place to stay in the middle of Shanghai	I loved this hotel! I was surprised to see a few bad reveiws, and all I can say is that our stay was wonderful. The location is perfect; near the bund and all the shopping. Lots of little alleys to explore and wander through. Easy walking distance to many places of interest.Our room was actually a suite, with separate bedroom with a Bund view. The furniture was not exactly my style, but it was newish, clean and seemed to fit the mood. We had water in the room daily, along with a variety of teas. The bathroom was modern with a very cool shower and separate bathtub. And the best, of course, was a computer with free internet in the room! We had no problem at all with the staff. The wait help in the buffet restaurant were not particularly friendly, but they were busy helping a large number of people. I enjoyed the variety at the breakfast buffet. The fruit was fresh and seasonal, including lychee, watermelon, longon, and others. They also had a nice cheese platter, along with Chinese Juk, and traditional western-style food. All in all, I would stay there again with no hesitation. I thought it was a great room for the price."
10,2309,"May 22 2009 	Worse In Asia So Far	This is by far the worse hotel we have stayed since traveling through Seoul, Beijing and Shanghai. We originally had reservations for three nights and after the first few hours immediately decided to change our reservations and switch hotels. We requested an early check-in and were told no problem. When we arrived after a 9 hour train ride, we were told we would have to wait until noon. Ridiculous. The rooms are old and worn. The bathroom is very small and dirty. For lunch we ordered room service and the girl did not speak any english. It took 30 minutes of calling back and forth to get our order in. I called the Assistant Manager for help and he did not do anything except have the girl who spoke no English call us back. Then when I called the Assistant Manager again he said he could not help because he was eating lunch and was busy! We then wanted to go to Cloud 9 at the Grand Hyatt. When we went to the conceirge to get a taxi, we waited for five minutes while the employees were goofing around. Then we asked how much the taxi would be and how long of a ride. We were told over 30RMB and it would take 20 minutes. He set us up with a taxi and told the driver to charge us 35RMB, no meter. The taxi ride took 10 minutes. On our return taxi trip, we used the meter and it only cost 15RMB. Ridiculous.The breakfast buffet is disgusting, the fruit is not fresh. The furniture is worn. We were shown to a dirty table that was actually being used by another return guest. Horrible.This has been the worse hotel experience ever. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Anyone that likes this hotel must only have experience staying at cheap motels back home and do not know better.Also the high-speed internet takes about five minutes to load a web page."
11,2309,"Jan 6 2009 	Loved it great location staff very helpful free internet in every room!	We were pleasantly suprised when we arrived at teh Salvo as it was a fairly 'cheap' option compared to others in shanghai. Location is great and our room overlooked the bund, great view. ROOM;Its very traditional in its design lots of dark wood and gold, very nice, our room had a big bathroom with a corner bath andf great shower, hairdryer was nice and powerful as well (normally a problem for me with having long hair to dry) Each room has a desk and sofa and chairs, 2 tvs, computer with free internet which is an excellent resource. HOTEL: Concierge very heplful with luggage, taxis, directions etc and speak quite good english. Business centre in there were we booked train tickets, commission was a lot and you could def get cheaper but we just found it convenient.. Girl in there was pretty rude though. December seems to be time for renovations in China as yet again there was work going on and some banging/noise. Then on the 2nd of 3 nights they made us move rooms which i was not happy at all but they did upgrade us. (I wouldnt recommend payong for an upgrade, not much difference at all, just couple more freebies and a table and chairs)LOCATIONGreat, you can easlily walk to the Bund area or taxis are very cheap. Shopping is great at the markets leave room in your case! M on the BUnd fabulous restuarant you must go, WEstern food, but very very good, reasonably priced (21 for 3 course meal on new years day) and the concierge cannot do enough for you, service was impeccable."
12,2309,"Dec 4 2008 	Perfect Choice	After being in the last two year in two other different and cheaper accommodations, I decided to book this hotel since my &quot;boss&quot; come with us and wanted a more comfortable hotel.After some search, and reading the TA reviews as usual, I decided to book this hotel since it seemed to be the best quality/price ratio for that period.I must say that I was happy with my choice.. I don't want to repeat the general description of the hotel itself, so, as usual, I'll write my &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;THE GOOD1) Location - it is 5 minutes (two blocks) away from Nanjing Road E and 10 minutes from the Bound. Placed in a small and safe one-way road, traffic noise is not present at all!2) Rooms - clean, medium space. We booked higher floor rooms, both single and double, and the result was a nice view, especially during the night.3) Breakfast - we were very happy about it - plenty of stuff, promptly refilled, both European and Asian style.4) Room maid - perfect!! Not disturbing you not requested, cleaning room in a short time while you are out..THE BAD1) The lobby bar - overpriced for being in China. A Tea/Coffee is offered at 5 euro each.. also the last floor bar, with live music, has very high prices.. but.. you should know before entering it..2) The crowded check-out - a long queue is present every morning, and you can take about 20 minutes to process it. This because this hotel is used by different &quot;tourist group&quot;, so if you are just behind them, you just need to be patience!3) Bath tube: even if provided with an &quot;old-style&quot; plastic curtain, (and using it in the right way), the water was flooding everywhere on the floor. Maybe, placing a fixed glass protection, at least at the beginning of the tube, would solve this problem.. THE UGLY1) Ok, I faced some problems: I asked the receptionist for a late check-out, and the answer was &quot;you book through an internet website, you should contact them to modify the reservation&quot;.. what?? just for a late check-out? Well, since I'm stubborn, I go again the day later, and the receptionist told me &quot;No problem, I can do it for you&quot;.. so.. It was a matter of the girl at the desk..2) Hotel Travel agency - I had to book two internal flights and the train.. ok, they did it, but they were really impolite. They also tried to overprice the transfer to the airport with their van. As usual: trade trade trade - you are in China!! Pay attention: if you are going to pay with Credit Card (as I guess 90% of you usually do), the Travel Agency will make you pay about 5% commissions. As you can see, very few bad things.. nothing compared to the nice time we spent in a clean and friendly hotel. The Concierge was very useful, suggesting us 4 different restaurant which was one better than the other!!I strongly recommend you this hotel for the location, the clear rooms, the good service and the prices.. an independent hotel brand which has nothing less compared to more famous (and expensive) international brands."
13,2309,Oct 22 2008 	Great Location for Shanghai	This was a great hotel with a super location. The room itself is very large and clean. Loved the fact I had a computer in my room for my personal use. Water provided daily which was a nice touch. Many places are easy to walk to from here or take a taxi - they are pretty cheap!! I would stay here again and recommend to anyone.
14,2309,"Aug 10 2008	Comfortable but a little bit boring	The Salvo is a five star hotel, living up to all expectations in both rooms and service. It's a little bit boring, compare to the west brand hotels as Park Hyatt, Radisson and Westin in Shanghai. If the Salvo is much less expensive then these, I would stay here again. The location is good in Huangpu next to the Bund and the shopping street. Great breakfast in the restaraunt at top floor with a nice view. Expensive but nice top-bar, where we was the only guest, with a fantastic view of the Bund and the radio tower. Roomservice was great and was delivered with a smile. Rooms was very spacius and well equipped with everything you need. Large bathroom with bathrobe and slippers, corner tub and shower. Seperate living area and bedroom and stuffed with great amenities. It's not a international hotel and you can feel the chinese management style overall, but it is ok. We had a good stay!"
15,2309,"Aug 2 2008 	Overnight Stay	I stayed at this hotel for 1 night before catching my return flight home. It is roughly 40 mins to an hour away from the airport and the cost should be no more that 160 rmb. On arrival check in was fine. Nice hotel, i found the corriders sickening hot, no air conditioning until you go to your room.The room was nice and clean, but my bathroom i did not consider to be 5 star rating, as there was some weird stains in the bath, to my dislike.The view was spectacular and the bed was comfortable. I did ask for wake up call for 5am, and did not get this, luckly i was awake......I ate at the japenese resturant and really liked the food.The next day they tried to charge me extra for breakfast, which i had already paid for online so they took the charge off their bill, and i did not even have time for breakfast anyway as i was leaving at 5.45am.Also the taxi to the airport tried to charge me over 360 rmb, so he fiddled with the meter but i gave him 200rmb, ashe made out he didnt understand, but they do.So be careful, always make sure you ask the price beforehand, otherwise they will try and swindle you for every penny, or the best way is to have the exact money and only give them that and say you nt have any more otherwise all taxi drivers will not give you change and make out they have none.Shangai is a great place and the location was more than ideal for shopping and doing tourist things."
16,2309,"Jul 22 2008 	Business room in August 2005	I stayed at Savo hotel in August 2005 when it was quite new. We had a business room for two persons. The hotel was nice and clean, and so was the room. One thing which was quite disappointing was that there were no non-smoking rooms or at least that we were told after we asked to be moved to a non-smoking room. Otherwise the room was nice and spacious, although the walls weren`t very soundproof.We used the hotel restaurant once, and the service was really good. Overall the staff was very eager to help. When we visited the bar, and asked for cigarettes, the bartender went to buy it for us from downstairs. Many of the staffmembers didn`t speak very good english, but everything went ok eventually. There were also some people that spoke very good english.It was very hot in August so the location could have a been a bit closer to Nanjing road because walking wasn`t really a pleasure. But it don`t mean it was far away, but if I go to Shanghai again, I will take a hotel closer to main streets. Although the taxis were ridiculous cheap, so we used taxi A LOT. The hotel surroundings weren`t very luxurious, but there were many constructions so I suppose the area could look totally different nowadays.Overall the hotel was very nice place to go back to relax after being harassed all day by all the street sellers and beggers. It was the only place where people didn`t stare and tug from arm. Especially my blue-eyed and blond husband seemed to a sight to many people in Shanghai, which was quite surprising :D"
17,2309,"May 29 2008 	Great!	Stayed in Salvo Hotel (Zhongfu Shifuhui) for 3 nights in May in a Superior Deluxe Room on 12th floorRoom is excellent with a nice view. A living room (with a tv with tons of channels), Bedroom (with a tv with tons of channels) and a bathroom with a huge bathtub and top range shower facilities.Location is pretty good, only a couple of blocks away from Nanjing RoadStaff are friendly and speak understandable english."
18,2309,"Jan 7 2008 	Central Location - godd but not great	We stayed at Salvo Hotel for two weeks. The hotel is five star and has western restaurant, local restaurant and japanese rest. The local restaurant i fair priced and has excellent food. We had a baby with us and the staff did not know what to do. Had to ask for babybed and babychair many times. The hotel is centrally located with only a few minutes to the bund, Nanjing road, the old town and subway. Would recommend this hotel if you get a good deal."
19,2309,"Oct 24 2007 	Love the Hotel Hate the food	We stayed at Salvo Hotel in the executive deluxe rooms for 4 days 3 nights from 19 October to 22 October 2007. Overall the standard of the rooms is above average. However, the hotel staff are not friendly. We noted that the hotel staff do not greet the hotel guests upon arrival at the main door or anywhere in the hotel. Free breakfast is provided at the 31st floor restaurant. However we noted that the service at the 31st floor restaurant is below average for a 5-star hotel. The waitress who collected the breakfast coupons from us each morning was also not friendly. The staff talked quite loudly among themselves. There is no variety in the type of food available. We had the same kind of food for all three mornings. The waiter and waitresses were not attentive. Most of the time we had to raise our hands to request for refills of coffee and tea. The tea that was served came with residue in the teacups !The hotel is conveniently located. Next to the hotel is an Italian restaurant which serves really cheap and tasty Italian food.It closes at 5 am. Check it out !"
20,2309,"Sep 30 2007	A real deal! by shadylaw	This is my 4th stay at Salvo Hotel and so far every visit has been pleasant. The staff can speak good english. It is 4 blocks away from the nanjing pedestrian walk. By taxi, you can get around town within minutes. The price is very reasonable compared to hotels in the Nanjing Pedestrian area (too over rated plus too touristy for me)."
21,2309,"Jul 20 2007 	Good tourist hotel but how can the restaurant not serve xiao lung bao?	My family and I stayed at the Salvo Hotel for 3 nights near the end of June 2007. We booked out three rooms as part of a package tour of China.The Salvo Hotel is a very nice tourist hotel that is located near Nanjing Road East (a pedestrian mall shopping district that is lit up like Vegas at night) and the Bund. In regards to other tourist sites in Shanghai, I cannot speak to the distance from the hotel, as we were picked up/dropped off by the tour bus and I did not really pay attention to the time or distance between sites. However, Nanjing Road East and the Bund are definitely within a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel (or shorter, depending on the speed of your stroll). Also depending on the facing of your room, you can get a great view of the Bund and/or the Pu Dong district (where the distinctive looking Oriental Pearl TV Tower is located).Some specific notes about the Salvo:1.) As mentioned above, we booked out 3 rooms (1 queen-bed room and 2 double-bed rooms). All rooms were 2-room suites with one room being an office/sitting area (with a desk and chair, couch, and tv) and the other being the actual bedroom. However, the queen-bed room also came equipped with a computer that was hooked up to the Internet. The double-bed rooms did not. There was no charge for us to access the Internet via the computer in our queen-bed room. (As a result, we switched one of our double-bed rooms to a queen-bed room so that we can have twice the Internet access!)2.) Unlike other hotels that we stayed at in China, the beds at the Salvo were not the &quot;typical&quot; rock-hard, super firm mattresses. Instead, the bed mattresses felt more like bed mattresses you'd find in U.S. hotels.3.) As some other reviewers have mentioned, the bathtub/shower setup is a little odd (not bad, just odd). The easiest way to explain it is to picture a large shower stall with a triangle-shaped bathtub that is in the far corner of the stall and takes up 2/3rds of the stall space. Then, closest to the shower doors, is a multi-headed shower structure with jets coming from the top and the middle. I've attached a picture of this in my review. Overall, the shower works just fine and none of us had any problems with temperature, water pressure, or anything else. None of us tried the tub, so I can't speak to how they are.4.) The breakfast area can get VERY crowded during peak hours (seemingly around 8am). The area is set up with only a handful of small 2- and 4-person tables and a large number of 10+ person round tables and seating is first-come first-serve. As a result, when it's crowded, be prepared to share tables. Also, if you are a mid- to large-sized group, you may find it a little difficult to all sit together. We were a 6-person group and one morning it took us about 10 minutes of hovering before we could claim 6 open seats at the same table.5.) The breakfast buffet was average in comparison with other hotel breakfast buffets that we have had in China. While it had about a 50/50 mix of Chinese and Western food items (including an omelet bar), there wasn't too much overall variety in food. The food itself was fine, and we had nothing to complain about.6.) The hotel restaurant does NOT serve xiao lung bao (the steamed pork and/or pork/crabmeat buns that Shanghai is so famous for). For me, this is an absolute egregious offense... especially at 11pm at night and you want to order them for room service."
22,2309,"Jun 23 2007 	Passable experience	I stayed at the Salvo for 5 nights this month. The room was comfortable and served our needs sufficiently. I appreciated the provision of unlimited amounts of bottled water as the tap water in Shanghai tastes really bad. However, there was no tea provided, well, other than Chinese tea, so bring your own if you need regular tea. The hotel is located about a 10-minute walk to the Nanjing Rd East subway station which is convenient enough if you don't mind walking. I travelled with my mother and so this really wasn't the best of hotels if you wanted to take the subway. A slightly more expensive option is to take a taxi (11 RMB vs 3 RMB), which is what we ended up doing most of the time. I found that this was the best way to travel most of the time as many of the places of interest for us, namely Yu Gardens, Lujiabang Fabric Market, were not within walking distance. The staff of Salvo were sufficiently polite but not friendly. The concierge could advise on the best options for day-tours to Suzhou and that saved us some of the costs if we went on a packaged tour. The hiccups were that there were no English cable channels on TV and so we really had nothing to do in the night other than be subjected to the miserable screenings of the only English channel on CCTV. I also found the room to have a slightly musty smell of stale smoke , but my mother didn't find that to be a problem at all, so it may just have been my sensitive nose.All in all, a satisfactory stay though I wouldn't choose to stay there again unless I intend to spend a lot of time near Nanjing Lu. My advice would be to stay near a subway station as it is easy to use and the self-service machines provide English instructions for buying tickets."
23,2309,"Jun 22 2007	Choose Somewhere Else To Stay	I stayed at the Salvo Hotel in Shanghai, China from June 9, 2007 - June 15, 2007. I want to preface my review by letting you know that I had just stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Beijing which influenced my views on the Salvo Hotel.The Positives:The Salvo Hotel is a few blocks away from the River (which has upscale restaurants and stores) as well as a nice shopping district that does not allow automobiles (I don't remember the name of the district, but go straight out the front door until you hit the shopping). The Salvo Hotel is in a great location. The lounge on the 31st floor has great views of the River and has a good selection of drinks. My group found it to be a good place to hang out in the evening when we did not feel like going out. The rooms were quite spacious, although the two beds in my room were twin sized. There is free internet if you hook up on a hard wire with your laptop from your room. Some rooms (single rooms) have a computer provided. We could not find any networks to hook up to.I liked the sushi place on the first floor, but I am not a sushi connoisseur, so I don't want to give the impression that it was great sushi. Some of my group members that I traveled with did say it was good. It is fairly cheap. If you are into Chinese food, there are a lot of restaurants around the hotel (in walking distance). The shopping district also has McDonalds, KFC &amp; Pizza Hut for the Western inclined food. We saw by the River a lot of non Chinese upscale restaurants (which were expensive). Literally across the street is a small shop that sells drinks for very cheap prices.The Negatives:The breakfast selection was not very good in the &quot;Nice Western Restaurants&quot; (actual name) and I ended up eating a &quot;dinner&quot; (veal, rice, bread, watermelon) for breakfast because the choices were not that appetizing. I tried the cereal and had to throw it out because it tasted disgusting. Also, the cook for the eggs liked to add extra ingredients from his body into it, so I stayed away from it. You need to open up every top to the buffet line because the translations are not correct and what you might think a dish is actually something else. There is free Chinese bottled water, and I suggest you take some with you for the day.Although the rooms were fairly big, the bedroom was actually small (there is a sitting room with a desk, couch and TV). The bathroom had a huge bath tub, but the shower, which was not in the bath tub, but right outside of it (using the same &quot;shower door) was extremely small and did not have great water pressure. There is only one sink and only one person can be in it at a time because of how small it is. Outside of the bathroom, there was a wet spot that looked like it had mold on it. As other reviewers have commented on, the rooms and hallways were very dark because of the decor and dark wood.If you do not speak any Chinese, I would suggest you not stay at this hotel. The staff barely speaks English at all and the people who do; do not speak it very well. Another issue I had with the hotel is that they charged me to exchange money where the Ritz did not.While I stayed at the hotel, they took away the English speaking channels (1-6, CNN, ESPN, HBO, STAR, and National Geographic) with no explanation and not ETA on when it would be corrected.Conclusions:They say that this hotel is a 4-5 star hotel and I disagree with it. I think, at best, it is a 2.5 star hotel. In my opinion, the location is about all it has going for it. If you have the money, I would suggest staying at a Western hotel. I don't think by staying at a Western Hotel, you would lose out on any experience of being in China."
24,2309,"Nov 27 2006	Service and price good accomodations left a little to be desired	I stayed at the Salvo for three days on a recemt business trip to Shanghai and had a relatively mixed experience. The rooms were quite large and very nicely decorated. The service was very good and there was a computer in the room. The location was excellent, very close to Old Shanhai and other attractions. Negatives about the place were as follows:- rooms were a bit dark and in part due to the sheer size of the large wooden furniture felt a bit cramped.- there was a very strong musty wood smell in my room and the smell was worse in a colleague's room. Not sure what it was, but it kind of smelled like musty oil stain or something.- the internet connection (which you had to pay for) was very very slow, whether you used the in room computer or hooked up a laptop to the ethernet cable.All in all, it was a good experience, but if I had to choose, there are probably better alternatives for the price."
25,2309,"Oct 21 2006 	suiterooms with your own PC	This was the greatest room of our journey.First we had a wonderful view of Shanghai at the riverside with the pearltower in front. We slept with open curtains because of the romantic view. We had a suiteroom( Luxe-executive room)withe two TVs and PC with internetconnection, so never a dull moment when we 're returning from strolling around at the nearby Nanjing road and the BundGreat brakfast too, althought the breakfastroom was a little overcrowded when you arrive at normal breakfast time at 8.amOnly complaint is the noisy airco, but overall wonderful stay nearby the main important area."
26,2309,"Jul 25 2006	Don't go for ""business twin"" rooms	I saw the three positive reviews on tripadvisor, and asked a couple of Chinese people who live in England about the hotel who told me that this must be a very new hotel (allegedly it was built in 2004) I decided to go for Salvo. I booked it through ineedhotel website, a Chinese agent in Beijing that facilitates booking of Chinese hotels for English-speaking customers. The travel agent was very helpful and I had a good feeling about it. I booked a &quot;business twin&quot; room which was the cheapest in the list. But given that it claimed itself to be a five-star hotel, I thought it cannot be bad. I have stayed in three-, four- and five-star hotels in Shanghai in the past, and even three-star hotels were not that bad so I was in for a nice room.When I got to the hotel, the room we were shown to was facing some kind of office that had its door wide open, and two ladies very shabbily dressed were chatting very loudly, and some not-too-appealing music was played very loudly, too. Whenever we went back to the room we had to see those ladies staring at us and hear the loud music. The room was very stuffy, smelled musty. My sister had an allergic reaction to the air, although I was okay. The bathroom smelled like it was not cleaned properly, and the smell reminded us of those public bathrooms in China. And there was no bathtub, only a shower stall. I thought that a five-star hotel (or semi-five-star, as some reviews state) cannot have a room without a bathtub given that normally hotels are ranked according to the kinds of amenities they have. The cheaper room we stayed in at Salvo, allegedly a &quot;five-star&quot; hotel, was shabbier than the three-star hotels (and even newer two-star hotels in Beijing) I have stayed in in China, particularly regarding the smell in the bathroom and the lack of bathtub.I do realize that even five-star hotels in China has some weak plumbing around the bathroom. But the smell and the dinginess of the bathroom was quite unconscionable I went downstairs to ask the receptionist to change the room.But the receptionist who were very friendly when she checked us in suddenly became unable to understand English. I spoke in Chinese, which didn't really help. She basically said you get what you pay for, and she cannot move us to another room unless we add 322RMB to the rate we were paying. I told her that would get me a genuine five-star hotel so I was going to change the hotel. I had booked for six nights so I was hoping she'd agree to change us to a different room. But since she refused, I turned to Expeida.com and booked Jinjiang Hotel, a real five-star (maybe 4.5 to some people). I am glad I did not pay for the whole six nights there, I could leave this hotel after enduring it for one night.The only upside about this hotel is that the porters absolutely refused to take the tip, which used to be the case in all hotels in China ten years ago. But I don't mind tipping the porters when they do carry my bag.The breakfast was mediocre but decent. I saw a head waitress behind the counter spitting into the sink, and she did not seem to realize that it was sort of not nice thing to do in front of people who are eating food. Overall, this hotel is &quot;too Chinese&quot;--good old socialist feel where no one had any concept of service. It's okay if it is dirt-cheap hotel. I'd find even spitting and throwing room keys at the customers somewhat cute. But given that I paid pretty dencent amount of money, I didn't appreciate the sound of spitting in a restaurant and the rough manners of the receptionist(s). It is indeed pretty close to Nanjing Road, but it is not as close as the other reviews claim to be. Having stayed at Peace Hotel, and given that Expedia has an incredible deal on Peace Hotel at least this summer (some rooms much cheaper than Salvo), I'd go for the Peace Hotel if I want a classic Shanghainese feel AND the proximity to Nanjing Road (Peace Hotel is on Nanjing Road)."
27,2309,"Jun 8 2006 	Perfect for litlle price	Worldwide experienced traveler , giving full compliments to this hotel in particular .Upright politenes , clean rooms , wide range of arrangements and facilities .Friendly , english speaking staff , In midlle of town center , reachable by foot ..If i come again , it shurely will be may choice again !!!"
28,2309,"Jan 7 2006	Hotel Salvo - I would stay there again	I am very glad I picked Hotel Salvo. It was very well located, the rooms were very clean and not too small. I only had two little complaints - first, there was a lack of water pressure on the 14th floor, so the shower was more like a trickle. And for some reason, there were no clocks in the room. Two nice televisions, but no clocks. I asked the front desk if we could have one, and they said &quot;the rooms are not equipped for clocks.&quot; Odd.But I would stay there again. The bathroom was nice, the lobby and staff were fine. The hotel breakfast was not that good, but it got us out the door. So I give it a thumbs up."
29,2309,May 29 2005	central salvo	the 5* salvo hotel was a bargain at us 83 dollars per room per night. the rooms were spotless and had tea and coffee making machines. (take your own tea and coffee - the local stuff is an acquired taste.) there were 2 beds - large single size and a sofa and armchairs.there were several offices on our floor - apparantly it's quite common in china for the hotels to rent out rooms to companies for this purpose. we were in no way disturbed by this. one of our sons lives in shanghai and went to check out several hotels prior to our arrival. this was the only one where the staff were friendly and spoke english and also showed him a room. the bund and nanjing road were within 3/4 blocks.go for a drink in cloud 9 in jiamao tower(pudong)for the view.the business restaurant in the hotel was good value for money although nothing memorable. the beer is much cheaper here thasn in the groundfloor bar. if you cross the street from the hotel there is an abundance of tiny cafes and shops. taxis are very cheap but drivers don't usually speak any english and are reluctant to pick you up. the hotel tells the driver your destination. don't expect to find ant tourist information places; they either move or have been demolished!the street signs are in chinese and english so it makes it easy to navigate.

2,2310,"Nov 14 2009 	Awesome hotel!	Two nights here at the end of a marathon business trip to Hong Kong and China. First timer to Shanghai as well. This hotel is about one year old, and owned by the Want Want snack company- their logo of a funny looking kid is all over everything. All of the drinks and snacks in the room are their product and therefore free. Room was huge- American King bed, desk and chair, sofa and coffeetable, large wardrobe, bath slippers and robes, sunken garden tub, fridge, free broadband (wired). Had room service one night, cheap and quick! Desk staff were excellent and I was overall very, very impressed by the hotel. Note that it it primarily used by business travellers and it is an inexpensive, but lengthy, taxi ride into the proper city centre. Public transport links I understand are excellent but I did not get a chance to use them. There is a 24 hour tiny grocer, alldays, just around the corner, but did not seem to be too much else as far as dining and shopping nearby. But again dining in the hotel was cheap and delicious. Breakfast buffet was very large and international, and included in the room rate. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
3,2310,"Mar 13 2009 	Elegant with a twist...	This is an absolutely first-rate hotel is every respect. The staff was everywhere, offering to be helpful. I had a problem with the Internet access in my room, and someone appeared with a new cable within seconds after I hung up the phone to report it. The room was impeccably clean. The only weird touch: it's apparently owned by a snack-food company, whose mascot adorns everything... a little like a Disney character, but not quite as cute. I can't speak to the location (it was convenient to the Expo center, which is what I was interested in) but it is next to a metro station, and the Shanghai metro is as nice a system as I've seen. The restaurant was quite good."
4,2310,"Nov 24 2008 	Best for Mandarin speakers	This hotel is clean and spacious, the staff are friendly and helpful and they do a good buffet in the evenings for 120 renminbi. That's the good news. The hotel caters chiefly for chinese tourists and business people, it's located well out of the city centre with no metro link so it's a taxi or a couple of bus rides into town. The staff are helpful but have very limited english so communication was an issue. If you're new to China , like me, you migt be better spending a little more and staying more centrally."
5,2310,"Aug 6 2006 	What a rat hole	I totally agree with the last review. All I can say is if you decide to go to China, do not stay in anything less than a 5 star. I thought a three star would be our equivalent to a Motel 6 - no way. The A/C did not work well, bathrooms always had mildew and the carpets in the dining area were so dirty, I could only imagine what the cooking area looked like. This hotel needs a major overall. The bedding was clean and they always try to make you happy but I have a problem with dirty walls, carpets and chairs. Shanghai is a great metro place and we were in a hotel at the end of the city where there was very little to walk to. Try to get something close to the Bund."
6,2310,Jul 26 2006	Not a 3 star hotel	Just returned from a tour of China and ended our tour staying at the Qianhe Hotel. Not a good experience! Carpet was so dirty and stained both in the rooms and in the halls that we were almsot afraid to walk on it. Rooms were woren and furniture frayed. Advertised bar was a counter in the coffee shop. Only one of the two advertised resteraunts existed and the advertised shops were a shelf in the computer room! We ate breakfast in a dirty old banquet room and when I asked that the empty coffee carafe be refilled I was told &quot;No&quot;. The breakfasts were the worst of our tour. We were told we could cash travellers checks which they would not do until our tour guide intervened. Do not stay at this hotel unless you are really looking for cheap. It is inexpensive but I would advise spending a few more dollars and staying at a hotel where you don't have to be concerned about what might be in the carpet!
1,2312,Aug 13 2009 	ok but nothing special	We stayed here at the end of a tour around China arriving in the early hours after being delayed due to the weather. At check in the staff were rather uncommunicative and after giving us our room didn't even point us in the direction of the lift let alone assist us with where to find our room or help us with our luggage. Rooms were clean and adequately equipped but nothing to write home about and more like a fairly low quality 3* hotel than the 4* it is advertised as. Breakfast was ok with a reasonable range of options but not of a comparable standard to other 4* hotels I have stayed in across Asia.Fine for a night or two as a base in Shanghai but i am sure there are better options around.
2,2312,"Jul 16 2009 	Ok rooms location not that great	Stayed for 2 nights. Rooms were not that big. Small bathroom. Overall ok, but I think that you could find better, closer to sightseeing and shopping.Breakfast was not too good. Not much of an option, so the second day we had breakfast elsewhere.Try the HAPPY FEET massage/reflexology clinic in the alley next to the supermarket."
3,2312,"Jan 13 2008	A Vast Improvement...	I have stayed at dozens of different hotels in Shanghai and across China, and have stayed at The Shanghai Hotel several times over the past few years.Before the hotel had some irritations for me - minor, but they were there. The staff had previously seemed cold and aloof; the breakfast was mediocre and if I had a problem then the staff's English seemed to disappear.This hotel is one of several in Shanghai managed by Shanghai Jin Jiang International (Group) Company Limited, and has been for some years. Now I am personally convinced that there has been a change of management in this company, and that international management has been brought in.My reasons for saying this are twofold: one, the standard of printed English in the new hotel literature in the rooms is exemplary, the best I have ever seen in China and as far as I am concerned is wordperfect. Second, the transformation in the standard of the hotel is huge. The staff are helpful and pleasant, the duty manager especially went out of his way to help a member of my group who left a cash card in the atm at reception. The breakfast is great, and there are far fewer bored and disinterested staff shuffling about trying to find something to do.I also noticed on this visit to Shanghai that the Peace Hotel, also managed by the same group, has now been closed - not before time! I look forward to it being refurbished and reopening 'under new management'!The Shanghai Hotel has also revamped and improved its business centre, and also had signs pointing to a swiming pool (although I didn't visit this).Also, the improvements here have not resulted in a massive price hike - not yet anyway."
4,2312,"Nov 18 2007	overall good hotel.	Location was not the greatest, but taxis are cheap. We tried to walk back from the Pu Dong but ended up getting a taxi.Breakfast was nice.Rooms looked a bit tired &amp; bathroom floor stained.Luggage took ages to come up &amp; when i tried to get it off the trolley myself the porters insisted on delivering it themselves."
5,2312,"Oct 5 2007	Not Too Bad	I stayed at this hotel for three days with a group of high school students at the start of our China Tour. The rooms were OK, though the beds in some rooms were a little hard, it was a lottery as to whether you got a soft bed or a hard bed. I shared a triple room with two other teachers and it was very crowded, but that was to be expected. The breakfasts were quite good - we were served in the Level 1 restaurant which was nicer and less crowded than the ground floor restaurant. Staff were efficient but not overly friendly. Not all staff spoke enough English to communicate our needs but again, we got by. Some of the students ranked this their favourite hotel."
6,2312,"Sep 30 2007	A great start to our China Trip	This was the start of our 2 week Page &amp; Moy trip. We were very pleasantly surprised at the standard of the hotel. Staff were very curteous and efficient. Ground floor bar and snack bar was very good (just be aware that if you order a sandwich, it comes with chips and is very filling).The most impressive thing was the breakfast - everything you could want in both western and chinese, even japanese sushi. Would certainly recommend this hotel."
7,2312,"Sep 29 2007	Rooms are OK service not so brilliant	Stayed here for 3 nights in Sept 07 as part of a tour of Eastern China. The room was comfortable enough with good facilities, but the service left a lot to be desired. Staff at front of house were rather aloof, the bar was a bit of sad lonely place and the mixed drinks not very inspiring. We had a group meal in the hotel one night, and it was awful - as if they were making no effort for a bunch of tourists."
8,2312,"Aug 7 2007	Very welcoming and comfotable.	I stayed in the Shanghai hotel for work purposes in February/March 2007 and I thought it was really nice. The hotel rooms are well decorated, have air conditioning and heating, tv with various channels including sky news and music channels. The hotel lobby is stunning, large and bright, and has a cosy little bar (which serves very nice red wine). I dined in the executive breakfast room most mornings which had plenty on offer (free, and buffet style including bacon, sausage, cereal, toast, coffee). It also had a beautiful view of the Shanghai skyline. I will return to Shanghai again and each time I do I will use this hotel again, I cannot fault it."
9,2312,"Jul 23 2007 	A descent hotel at a descent price	The location of the hotel is not the best for a tourist on a tight schedule, though the taxi fares in Shanghai is fairly cheap, averaging RMB 17 one way within the city (RMB7.5= U.S.$1). Our friday stay was U.S.$80. Same type of hotel at tourist areas can cost at least $50 or more. The hotel is between end of 3 star to beginning of 4 star with clean beds &amp; bathroom, descently decorated room and lobby, restaurants and gift shops. Their service is pretty well rounded, from laundry service, cell phone charging to currency exchange. Most of the check in/out staffs are friendly except some of the managers standing in the lobby having a very cold look. If you stay less than 2 days in Shanghai, I recommend pay a little more and stay at Nanjing Road which is more centrally located. Otherwise, you can see a lot of local cultures as soon as you walk out of this hotel. There are local small shops, bars &amp; restaurants, convenient stores which are all of good qualities and services."
10,2312,"Jul 16 2007 	Not the Best in Shanghai	My wife and l spent four nights in this Hotel, prior to embarking on a organised tour of China. I approached the Hotel a little apprehensive after viewing many comments on Trip Advisor.It was certainly not a four star Hotel as purported in the Travel Brochures, and would rate at the bottom end of three star.Be that as it may, our accomodation was clean. The location of the hotel is near the subway, but more importantly it is in a location that allows you to wander the streets and see many of the real faces of China. There are plenty of small shops nearby and a large supermarket within one km..Whilst l found the reception staff quite unpleasant, all other staff were approachable and where possible helpful. For a Hotel that has significant foreign tourism, there is indeed a lack of English language support available within the Hotel.Breakfast was indeed satisfactory, although there are two locations and there seemed continual confusion into which dining room we should attend. My tip is just be polite and direct and they will agree with you.The Laundry service here was indeed cheap and excellent."
11,2312,"Jun 10 2007	Very good location	We stayed six nights at the Shagnhai Hotel on Wulumugi Bei Lu as part of our 14 days group tour of China in May from Alberta, Canada. We had a room on the 14th floor. This hotel is located in a busy district of Shanghai across from the biggest hospital in Shanghai. From our room we could hear the traffic and car honks early in the morning. The hotel rooms were small, and yet the hotel had met our travel expectations: clean room, clean bathroom, hot shower, and working air conditioning. The quality of the Western and Chinese buffet breakfast was average. The hotel is within walking distance to many local shops, an upscale mall, a subway station, and restaurants including Pizza Hut. Taxi fare is cheap in China. We took the taxi to visit the new Pudong commercial district overlooking the Bund and the Shanghai Museum. The most we paid on taxi fare was 26 RMB, which was less than $4.00 Canadian. If you like Chinese arts, culture, and history, the Shanghai Museum is a must see. The entrance fee is 20 RMB, which is less than $3.00 Canadian, a great bargain. The museum also has a great gift shop. If you are looking good local restaurants in Shanghai, visit Canglefang on #333 Changle Road for Shanghai food, Dongbeiren on Shan Shee South Road for Northern Chinese food and the waitresses will sing Chinese folk songs at your table, and Paulaner Brauhaus Shanghai at Riverside Promenade overlooking the Bund, Binjiang Dadao in Pudong for very good German cuisines, burgers, fries, and clubhouse sandwiches."
12,2312,May 7 2007 	Very short stay	The hotel was booked as part of a package deal. We were in a twin room for 2 nights. We didn't use all the hotel's facilities as we were out visiting sites most of the time. Buffet breakfasts were a great start to the days sight seeing.
13,2312,"May 5 2007	OK but nothing special	We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. It is ok, but nothing special. We only paid 85$ a night, so it is a fair price for that hotel. You will enjoy Shanghai, a very nice town.Two negative things: First, we had to wait very long to get checked in, second, the internet was definately not high speed.Would come again"
14,2312,"Mar 6 2007	Very good hotel near Jing'An Subway stop	We stayed at this hotel 4 times in the past 6 months, and each time had a great stay. It appears to cater to Asian and European tourists and business people, so you will see almost no North Americans. The hotel rooms - at least in our experience - meet US standards. The rooms are well decorated with all the amenities, the furniture is well-styled and well-maintained (except in one room where it was pretty scratched), Cable TV works well, the mini bar is well-stocked, etc. The lobby is a bit spartan, altho there are some gift shops. You won't get any phone calls asking if you want a &quot;massage&quot; as you would at some other Chinese hotels, but you will usually see some &quot;ladies&quot; standing discreetly in the shopping arcade entrance at night. The hotel has a business services office with Internet - use it if you must, but there is an internet gaming center about a block from the Jing An subway stop that offers 1 hour of internet access for the equivalent of US$1. This hotel is conveniently located from an Italian restaurant and coffee shop called Vero Moda, a traditional tea shop called Sophie's, and a very good restaurant called A Future Perfect. If you're making reservations while you're in China, use elong.net ( a partner of Expedia) to get the best rates."
15,2312,"Dec 7 2006 	OK but not great	The rooms themselves are pretty nice and the bed is very comfortable. I disagree with the previous reviewer though who said the location is good - it's about a 10mins walk and 5 stops on the subway to the Bund or over 30mins in a taxi due to the everpresent rush-hour. There are many more hotels much closer to the centre. The level of English at reception was very poor which you would not expect in a 4-star in Shanghai. The gym is a real disgrace - one treadmill, one bike and a few dumbells in the middle of a hallway outside the business centre - if queuing for everything with no A/C and a load of bored businessmen watching you is your idea of fun then this is the gym for you! Finally breakfast is pitched very much at the Asian traveller with soggy, warm toast adn undercooked eggs the choice for the westerner."
16,2312,Oct 18 2006	The Shanghai Hotel was my home for three weeks...	I stayed in the Shanghai Hotel for 19 days while visiting friends there. I enjoyed my stay there including the free American Breakfast. The location is excellent for commuting to many parts of the central city..Staff was cordial and well dressed and helpful to me. The room was clean and well maintained by our porter. I highly recommend the hotel.Ron Lewis
17,2312,"Dec 10 2005	OK Accommodation but good location	Hotel is really old but location is good. Neighborhood has all that you need. The only &quot;ding&quot; in our room is that the shower [--] - water is REALLY weak. Other than that, clean and comfy hotel. We paid about US$80 per night and was told that it's a good deal for the quality and location."
18,2312,"Oct 6 2005	Loved Shanghai	We stayed at the Shanghai hotel for 3 nights at the start of our tour with Page &amp; Moy. The hotel staff were numerous and friendly and the only problem, if you could call it that, was when we came to change travellers cheques. The hotel has a policy of ringing the bank to clear acceptance of travellers cheques and on 2 occasions it took about 20 minutes to do this even though they were Thomas Cook cheques and we had our passports with us. Obviously they have been stung by fakes in the past but we wished we had just taken cash with us instead of cheques as recommended by the tour company. This was the only hotel where this happened - elsewhere no problem. The rooms were large and clean. The furnishings had seen better days but were acceptable. The location is not that far from city centre but taxi needed to get there as crossing roads is an impossibility with thousands of bikes, mopeds and 4 lanes of cars in each direction. There was a lovely Italian restaurant about 200 yards away which made a nice contrast to Chinese food twice a day! The restaurant tended to be crowded at breakfast time as many people with tour companies leaving early on days out. There was a good selection of western items at breakfast including egg, bacon, toast, fruit, fruit juice, cereals and yoghurt. Do not miss Shanghai at night and the 'tunnel' ride under the river - Fantastic!! A real highlight."

1,2323,Felt cheated on extras	The location is good but has lot of construction going on. Watch out for what is being charged extra in this hotel. A laundry bag could cost you USD$ 7/-.
2,2323,Nov 11 2009 	solid not opulent but clean and comfy and GREAT location	very solid hotel in good location - walking to hi-end shops and close to city central. Very safe. Beds a little hard but that is common in China. This place was solid without any real red flags. We got it as part of tour package so not sure of pricing but this is a solid cant go wrong business class hotel that was more than fine for tourists. Comparable to a Four Points or a Courtyard.
3,2323,"Nov 5 2009 	Pick a different place.	Nasty neighborhood, near auto repair and machine parts shops. Under construction. Rooms lacking some basic amenities, like dresser drawers. Lots of better choices in Shanghai."
4,2323,"Oct 30 2009 	Disaster	Don't ever consider staying at The Bund Riverside Hotel. It is disgusting.The lobby looked OK with the obligitory chandelier but beyond that it was a disaster.Rooms small and very tired. Toilet did not flush, rooms lights flickered and made a zapping sound, the airconditioner was noisy, the curtains were dirty. Once varnished timber trim painted brown. The dining room where breakfast was served was disgusting. Curtains hanging off hooks and not clean. Walls water stained. Utensels for tea/coffee/congee/cereal and toaster were not clean. Staff uniforms not clean. No conception of service. Little comprehension of English. Reception and housekeeping was no better. No conception of service and little understanding of English. (They actually asked us if we spoke English). The only thing going for it - close to Nanjing Walking Street."
5,2323,"Oct 25 2009 	Terrible!!!	The rooms are dirty, the service is terrible. The price is much higher then what the hotel give you. The breakfast (that cost 90 RMB!!!) is ridiculous.There are many many hotels in Shanghai, don't choose this one!"
6,2323,"Oct 25 2009 	Nice furniture comfortable bed lovely bathroom...but find something in the French Concession	For the price, the place was great. Definitely skip the overpriced restaurant and bar...but the rooms are tastefully decorated and nice (the carpet was the only thing showing age). The staff was alright, good by Chinese standards (meaning if you expect people to be fluent in English or be overly polite, maybe China isn't the right place for you...the staff speak English well here and were much more professional than any other place we stayed in China). The location is okay, however almost all of the Bund is destroyed due to Expo 2010 construction, but this affects all hotels in the area. One bonus is the windows are thick and if you can get up room on the upper floors, there is no noise. If you are wanting to stay in this area, the hotel is great, although I would suggest finding a hotel in the much nicer French Concession."
7,2323,"Oct 8 2009 	great choice good value	We booked this hotel in Shanghai as last stay in China on our honeymoon. We were quite worried about the type of hotel we had booked, as it doesn't belong to any international chain of hotels available in the centre of Shanghai and we were aware that you never know what to expect when you're so far away from home. We have been very much surprised to see that the hotel is located in a strategic position, perfect I dare say, for those who don't want to spend too much but still whish to stay in the centre, just behind Nanjin Road. Many attractions could be reached on foot! We had been given a fantastic room on top floor with a panoramic view on the skyscrapers. Wonderful. This is the best hotel we could ever choose in Shanghai, we have had a great time. Of course there are many other hotels that can offer you 5 stars service but as already said, this is a good choiche at non expensive rates."
8,2323,"Oct 4 2009 	Not bad if you get a good rate.	We stayed for 6 nights on the 12th floor in a Superior City View room. Overall, the hotel was good but the main reason was that we got a rate of 53USD through Travelocity. Except for the carpet, the room was clean with a big bathroom and comfortable bed. The view wasn't particularly good, but not an issue. Outside noise was low and not bothersome.PROS: After the rate, the second strong point is the location. It's a 10 minute walk to Nanjing road and the metro station and maybe 20 minutes to the Bund.CONS: As some others have noted, the carpet was stained and very unattractive. However, it wasn't &quot;dirty&quot; and that was the only cleanliness issue we encountered. Second, in spite of listing it as a PRO, the location could have been better. We used the metro a lot, and would have liked to be closer, especially when it was raining. Also, the hotel is located in a industrial supply neighborhood so there aren't as many food vendors/shops and restaurants as we'd like. And, it just makes for an unattractive area for walking. Breakfast, which wasn't included in our rate, was okay but very expensive at about 14USD. Internet, at 1 yuan per minute, was pricey."
9,2323,"Sep 11 2009	Good value great location amazing Pudong views	We chose a superior room with Pudong view. It was very comfortable, had two queen size beds, safe, coffee/tea making facilities, bathrobes...at affordable price. Had breakfast the first day but found it not quite good and pricey. Just five minutes walking from Naning Rd. and metro station.Reception staff was helpful but some of them didnt speak much english.I recommend it for a fee nights in Shanghai with a good view if your budget is not too high."
10,2323,"Aug 28 2009 	Great hotel - value 	Please ignore all other bad reviews of this hotel as I was amazed what a great vale hotel it was. My wife &amp; I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and only booked a week before so paid NZ$85 per night with no breakfast. We were surpirswed how modern the hotel was and for a Chinese 4 star wasn't expecting much. But it is clean and centrally located to both the Bund &amp; Nanjing Rd (max 10 mins walk). Ok some of the back roads to the hotel from Nanjing Rd are dirty but THIS is China so what do people expect!!! We walked everywhere &amp; late at night and NEVER felt remotely threatened so no issue there. The location is fantastic and for the price I paid great value. Put it in perspective &amp; if you want a clean, central hotel for no cost then go here. If you want a Hyatt style hotel then forget it but realise you get what you pay for in this life so if you want a modern hotel then expect to pay Hyatt prices.Recommended for all visitors."
11,2323,"Jul 12 2009	Disappointing	The hotel was clean and with great facilities, but the staff are not very helpful. Room service breakfast was mostly cold and congealed, despite inflated price.Unbelievable charge for internet use of 30 Yuan (approx GB3.00) PER MINUTE! It was also quite slow, presumably in order to be able to charge more money."
12,2323,Jul 9 2009 	OK	Great Things about this hotel:- Very roomy- $50/night- Location is a 5 min to Nanjing Rd which was a pedestrian mall. Pretty cool..- 10 min walk to the nearest subway station.- Helpful staffNegative things:- Bathroom stunk. Something really needed to be replaced - like the curtains.- Carpet was is poor condition- Don't eat at the Hotel. It's gross and expensive.- I'm not usually picky with beds but this hotel has really really hard beds. I always woke up feeling pain in my shoulders.
13,2323,"Jun 22 2009 	Clean quiet well priced brilliant location..	I stopped in and stayed here for one night, on a business trip.If a clean , quiet, easy to get to Hotel is what you seek, then look no further! The Bund Riverside is well priced ($70USD a night on WOTIF), and I will use it again next time I pass through ShanghaiReally really close to the underground station of Nanjing Road East (Number 2 exit)..Only a 3-5 minute walk through a (dirty) little lane, you will be at Nanjing Road!!Bugger that they charge for Internet connection (1 Yuan per minute, or 100 Yuan for 24 hours). .....the breakfast was 50 yuan for the usual array of food associated with China...hence I gave it a wide nerth and ate elsewhere."
14,2323,"Jun 16 2009 	If you want only a room	Yes it's near the famed Nanjing Donglu (Nanjing Road East), but it's not a pleasant walk. It's an inspiring walk to the station only if you're interested in seeing the place for real - chaotic traffic, non -stop horning, touts outside rather depressing eateries, hardware stores, construction sites, vegetable peddlers, locals who suddenly turn, spit or litter as they talk. Not making a judgement about the locals (they're regular people like everyone everywhere else) but it's a snapshot of the scene I've encountered 4 days in the neighbourhood. Nothing green, nothing retail along the way to the station.Buildings under construction line the various routes to the hotel. What this means is that the usual pedestrian walkways are blocked (they do not carve out alternatives under such buildings) and pedestrians are forced to negotiate the road with bikes, motorbikes and cars, all of which don't give way even if lights are in your favour. It's especially difficult if it's raining (frequent in the summer).There are 2 or 3 dusty convenience stores along the various routes to the hotel where you can pick up water and snacks, but if you're expecting the clean, fresh, mouthwatering snacks or bento like those you get in such stores in Taipei or Tokyo, forget it. Got a grand view room, it looks out to other buildings. It's spacious but everything is aging. Old TV but you get star movies, BBC and CNN, no HBO. Turn it off for a while if it goes quiet, the sound comes back on the next time. The carpet is stained in some parts but the bathroom is clean enough, just a little rusty. The horning from the streets can be heard even from the room on the 9th floor. They will ask for a 600 yuan deposit at check in, no matter what your online agent says about prepaid bookings, so just prepare the money. Good value if you just want a room and some breakfast. But if your idea of Shanghai is the Nanjing Road East for shopping and the Bund, it's probably better to stick to those on Nanjing Road if you can pay for them."
15,2323,"May 28 2009 	good value for money	we stayed fr. 20th to 27th may. the first impression was not good. the carpet was badly stained. we asked to switch room, and they offered an upgrade but the room was much smaller, so we opted to stay in the same room as the front desk said they're running full occupancy. we checked out for on the 3rd day for an overnite stay at hangzhou but left our luggage with them and when we came back, they gave us an upgrade room (we didn't ask for it, so it was a very pleasant surprise), carpet was clean, room was even bigger than the one we had stayed in. for what we paid, i think its very good value. the staff were very helpful and tried their best to assist. there're a lot of constructions going on outside the hotel, but this is due to the Expo. the hotel is within walking distance to most attractions and cabs are easy to get and cheap. breakfast was very very boring. same thing for the entire stay. we had free internet and it was working well.in gist, its very good value for what we paid &amp; we had a very pleasant stay."
16,2323,May 26 2009 	Dont go to this hotel...EVER	Horriable is not the word if i need to mention about my experience...first time visit to Shanghai and heard a lot about the Bund area as such so when i saw the hotel listing where in it mentioned that it is located at the bund and at a great price i grabed the deal not knowing that this stupid hotel was in this commercial horriable area few blocks away from the bund and the view from my SUITE in this hotel was of the slums....Dont go in this hotel EVER
17,2323,"May 20 2009 	Great hotel great location great value	Stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to boarding a cruise ship. The location was great for exploring the Bund area. Quick and inexpensive taxi rides got us to the other major attractions. Hotel was very nice as was the staff. We had a few snacks in the lobby coffee shop and had some room service (average), but there were several restaurants in the hotel. The spa was convenient and open until 2AM for late massages after long days. One small warning for disabled travelers: the entrance to the hotel is up a long flight of stairs from the street. There is also a lot of construction in the area (and all of Shanghai) due to the upcoming Expo."
18,2323,May 11 2009 	Good value for money	This hotel is clean and well located. A block away from Najin street to the north and a very short walking distance from the Bund. Rooms are clean and bright and everything worked just fine.
19,2323,"May 11 2009 	Good hotel near Nanjing Road	The hotel is very close to Bund and Nanjing Road, in fact within walking distance. The area surrounding is bit dirty with construction and repair going on on nearby buildings. The hotel is clean and rooms with twin beds and window facing are good. However some rooms with queen bed is small. Rooms are clean. Breakfast menu is same everyday and never changes which I dont like."
20,2323,"May 6 2009 	More of a 3 star hotel!!!	I stayed at this hotel for a quick trip into Shanghai. It was a four night stay and overall it was a pleasant experience. I booked through Travelocity and they has this hotel pegged as a four star hotel. I beg to say even though this hotel has a nice lobby and the rooms are spacious this hotel is not a 4 star. The room it self was clean and spacious and the bed well, as everyone on here can tell you it was hard as a rock. I personally didn't have a problem with it, but some might. The downside of this hotel was the ac unit itself was not really working, I had it full blast and it barely got cool in the room. My friend who had another room, his ac unit was not working at all. He called and talked to the front desk about it several times to no avial. Luckily it was not that hot and survived with opening the windows. I had a room with a city view, needless to say the view was not that great. The breakfast was the same the four days we were there, no change at all. I would not recommend paying extra for breakfast if its not included. You can get better off site. There is a lot of construction going on in the areas, specifically next to the hotel. They usually start kind of early so get ready to hear metal banging. The internet is the room was included but I had issues with the download speed. It seemed to take forever, while my buddy said he has no problems. There is no WIFI signal. The TV in the room sucked. There were only maybe 3 English channels and the reception was horrible. I do have a trick, the tv itself is only a monitor and you can hook up the monitor to your laptop and you can play dvds from your laptop onto the big screen or even surf from there. All you have to do is disconnect the monitor cable from the cable box from the back of the tv and connect it to your laptop and to get sound disconnect the green audio cable and connect it to the headphone jack on your laptop. The location is pretty good. The main shopping street is about 5 mins away and you can find a lot of places to eat or shop at. There is a 24 McD's close by and I would recommend a restaurant called CW or CB Coffe house. they serve food in a coffee house enviornment. The food was good, the steak did not have a funny taste like most foreign countries do. I would only stay here again if the price was right. I would definetly try to find something with a pool next time. The hotel is a good base hotel and just for laying your head at night time. Don't expect grand things from this place."
21,2323,"May 5 2009 	Very Pleasantly Surprised	After a lot of debating as to whether to stay here, The Manhattan Business Hotel, or Charms, I was won over by this one. I wanted a great view so I asked for a digital queen on the 16th floor on my booking form (Riverside) which they honoured. The 17th is just below the restaurant and noisy as a previous reviewer pointed out and the view from the 16th is just as good. The room was not very big but there was a King bed with a desk, free internet, flat screen TV with CNN International and a few other news stations. There was also a great bathroom with stand alone shower which I really enjoyed the rainwater effect. Best of all, there was a bench in front of the window which protruded and you could sit there, chill and enjoy the city lights. As a solo traveller it was fine, but might have been a bit cramped had 2 people been in there.Service was good and began with a prompt reply to my email giving me the name of the hotel in Chinese and the address. This is essential if you are arriving by cab as the driver will not recognise the name. The staff and bell boys were very helpful but as I decided to stay an extra night, they could not give me a better rate than the one I found on expedia so I secured it that way and there was no problem. I read previous reviews of dirty windows obscuring the view, but as luck would have it, the window cleaners were there during my stay, see enclosed photo. :)Breakfast was in the restaurant on the top floor with very helpful staff and great views. They really can't do enough to help you there.I was a bit worried about the location, but it's about a 5 minute walk to Nanjing Road and the metro station. The neighbourhood was great with convenience stores everywhere and a relief from the tinsel and pestering on the Nanjing Road. I can understand it looking shady, but it was not at all. I was glad it was in an authentic area and best of all, there is a bank next door, too.Overall, I'd say, that you could have a great time in a central location without spending a fortune and relax in comfort at the end of a hard day of walking and sightseeing. Remember to get a Riverside view, though."
22,2323,"Apr 9 2009 	Excellent location once you get your bearings	We had 5 nights here in March and where very impressed for the price we paid, only slight downside was the beds being very hard but that seems to be a chinese staple.Would definately stay here again. Rooms spacious, breakfast quite good, and staff very helpfull."
23,2323,"Apr 9 2009 	Bund River side hotel - Good choice for business	Bund river side hotel is located in very near of Nanjing Road. Easy to access shopping streets and other amenities. Hotel will provide internet connection, which is rather expensive (100 RMB / day). Nice and friendly staff. The girls at lobby bar were very friendly. Maybe because i'm blond, 30'ish young man? Bund River Side Hotel is for you, if you are looking for basic accommodation."
24,2323,"Mar 20 2009 	5 star excellent service	We have booked for 4 nights stay with Bund Riverside for a Grand View Room 1615. Grand view room are very spacious with a King size bed. The bathroom is very new and spacious with separate bathtub, bathing and toilet section. No funny smell as mentioned by other reviewers.The best deal is to book through the hotel own website and registered as a member will entitled you for some freebies. Highly recommended for their hotel service - 5 star standard, fast and efficient. Initially we got a twin bed room and I've called to change to another room with king size bed. In 5 minutes time, the reception immediately arranged to bring us to view and change to the higher 16th floor at no additional charges. Location is about 3 streets away from the noisy and bustle Nanjing Road, about 10 minutes walking to Line 2, Nanjing East metro. My 5 years old boy enjoyed the walk. On the way back, will pass by some covenience stalls that you can grab some snacks and drinks back to hotel.Shanghai implement &quot;bring your own bag&quot; concept, chargeable for plastic bags. Very environment friendly. Do remember to bring your own tote bag when go shopping. Also highly recomended the Marcom Manager, Eric Wong who is always so accomodating and responsive to my email requests. Also the Front Office Manager, Phillips who personally came to carry our luggages to the lobby and personally called a cab for us to the airport. He even gave us his personal number to assure us if there are any hippcups on the way to airport. Added personal and VIP treatment that I received from Bund Riverside for my family. I will definitely highly recommend to anyone who visit Shanghai."
25,2323,"Mar 17 2009 	Unfriendly and unwelcoming - would not recommend to anyone	We were only in the hotel for an hour, however got a pretty good feel for the place from that. It was the third hotel we stayed at in China and had booked it because of the location and positive reviews on Trip Advisor. The staff were very unwelcoming when we arrived and the problem came with the baby cot they provided for our young son. I'd emailed and called to check they had one that was appropriate (ie safe and he couldn't fall out of) but the one they provided was totally inadequate. You'd expect that they'd try to help us out and find a solution (ie lower the cot as it was too high and our son would have fallen out/or provided another room with a larger bed/mattress on floor) - who knows - but they never even tried and seemed perfectly happy for us to leave. We had to find another hotel and whilst my husband searched on the internet I followed my son around the lobby area - it was very dirty/staff unfriendly and we were grateful to leave. Had we stayed our experience of Shanghai would not have been positive - however changing hotels meant we ended up having a wonderful end to our holiday."
26,2323,"Jan 7 2009 	Perfect Location	The hotel is in a perfect place for tourist, 5 minutes walk for the most famous shopping street, nagging road, and for the riverside to see Pudong, also for qipu market where you can buy anything. Rooms are not really big, but bed and badroom are king size, river view, breakfast ok, snacks include. I will stay any time i came to shanghai for sure."
27,2323,"Dec 20 2008	Not that great	Coming from a great hotel in Beijing which was also a 4 star, I really expected more here. Staff were not friendly and were not helpful at all. I mean, a smile or saying hi to the guests doesnt hurt, and not once did I get that. Asking for help was a big issue since they didnt speak much english. Also, the hotel room was clean, except our main concern was the sewage smell coming out of the bathroom. It got to a point when my sister and I had to put orange peels in hot water to try and get rid of the smell. The location is only 5 minutes about from East Nanjing Rd so it's great to walk, but a few people have told me not to walk through the lanes at night since it's not that safe. Also, we went in Dec so alot of the area is under constrcution. There is lots of hammering starting in the morning, and do avoid getting the &quot;riverside&quot; view, since it's alot of construction men working!My other concern was getting a taxi back to the airport. Since I went with my family, 1 taxi wasnt big enough so we asked them to book a maxi taxi. The thing is, the hotel was charging us 260 RMB, where as when we came to the hotel from the airport in a maxi taxi, it costs us only 150 RMB! They kept on insisting that the maxi taxi dropped us off &quot;down town&quot; that's why it was 150 RMB, but we were dropped off in FRONT of the hotel. Phil, the man that booked us the taxi was not very friendly and seemed impatient with us when we brought up the price differences and he kept saying that we weren't dropped off at the hotel! We did take the hotels maxi taxi and unwillingly paid the 260 RMB since we couldnt find our own maxi taxi. Just a quick note, the maxi taxi provided by the hotel was very very old and didn't even have a meter. (Our maxi taxi from the airport to the hotel was new and cheaper and HAD a meter!)Overall I was really unsatisfied with the hotel and there dishonesty."
28,2323,"Nov 25 2008	Service the best	This was a great place. The rooms are huge. The food was excellent and we had our own room for lunch. The location was perfect. Sat in the bar for hours, easy to relax in the lobby. Best place we stayed in our travels."
29,2323,"Nov 5 2008 	Great views helpful staff	The Bund Riverside is easy to get to from East Nanjing Rd metro station - about a 5-minute walk along a road with restaurants, a great little massage place and a couple of 24-hour supermarkets stocking big bottles of Tsingtao and Reeb for under AU$2 a pop. Hotel has a modern feel, is clean (except maybe the outside of the rooms' windows), most of the staff speak some English(ish) and there's a bar in the lobby and a restaurant on the 18th floor. Best of all are the views if you book a River View room. Our room (1708) had jaw-dropping views over to Pudong. Windows were grimy (from construction work below the hotel on a bridge over the Suzhou Creek) and when it rained the dripping on the bay window's flat ceiling got a little annoying - but all in all, for the price we paid (approx $600 for the 7 nights) - an absolute bargain! OK, it's not the Four Seasons but it's nicer than most hotels you will find in Australia at the price. Our room was one of the smaller ones, but the bed was big, bathroom massive, shower huge, everything new, BIG flat screen LCD TV with 50 channels (you've got to love Chinese ads) including CNN, BBC etc, and a bay window you could throw pillows on and sit back, soak in the views, sounds and smells (the windows open) while drinking cheap, tasty beer from the shops. The mattress was hard - but been told that's standard in China. I would recommend a River View room, but maybe avoid the 17th floor. It is directly below the restaurant, so you hear noises as staff move around tables at all hours, plus being the highest floor for rooms the bay window has a flat ceiling directly below the rain overflow off the roof. A couple of floors down wouldn't ruin your view of the Pearl Tower or Pudong. And maybe negotiate for a bigger room. We sneaked a peek inside one of the suites and they look really big. The stores all along Beijing Rd below the hotel sell industrial stuff - valves, washers and assorted metal things - but you can walk to the Bund in 10 minutes, Nanjing Rd in 5 and stores are all really close. Location is excellent if you plan to walk a lot or use the metro, which is the quickest and cheapest way to get around the city (ticket machines have English translations, most trips cost 3 or 4 yuan). And it's on Metro line 2, which connects from Longyang Rd station where the Pudong airport Maglev line stops. Took us 30 minutes from the airport to get to the hotel by train, very simple. The hotel will give you a China Daily newspaper on request (in English) and can exchange most of the major currencies (slightly better rates at the hotel than we got in Australia), plus there's a Bank of China next door. And they have cards at reception with the hotel location - plus all the most popular sights - in Chinese in case you take a taxi. We didn't eat in the hotel (too many choices in Shanghai) so no idea about the food. Overall, if you are in Shanghai to explore the real Shanghai and need a cheaper hotel close to the Bund, Nanjing Rd and within walking distance of the Old Town - plus a metro stop - I'd absolutely recommend it. Pudong might have much fancier places to stay, but the real Shanghai is on this side of the Huangpu River."
30,2323,"Oct 26 2008	Bund Riverside Hotel Shanghai	I recently stayed at the Bund Riverside Hotel in Shanghai Oct. 7th through the 10th. I must say this is one of the nicest hotels for the money that I have ever stayed in. I had read some reviews prior to my trip that made me a bit uneasy but I decided to book the room anyway. The staff was always willing to help and although English skills were limited it is in China! I think alot of western travelers expect everybody to speak English in the rest of the world. I think it's nice that they speak any English at all and are eager to help. The hotel is only a short walk to Nanjing rd. and a pleasant fifteen minute walk to the Bund. Some reviews claimed that it was far from the Bund and Nanjing rd. I guess if your lazy and don't like to walk it might seem far but I found the walk through the neighborhood interesting. I do advise walking down one of the streets to the Bund other than Nanjing rd. to experince real China. As far as the Hotel is concerned the room was fabulous with a stuning view of the city. I had read in reviews complaints about dirty carpet and mold in the shower, everything in my room was spotless and seemed to be recently renovated. I enjoyed drinks on the 18th floor lounge with panoramic view of the Bund. I highly reccomend The Bund Riverside, I have stayed in four star hotels that were five times the cost and not as nice!"
31,2323,"Sep 26 2008	Great hotel incredible view	I did stay three nights at the Bund Riverside in Sept 2008. Great and spacious room at 15th floor with a nice view on Pudong, close to Nanjing Road and the Bund.The room was the cleanest I ever got during my whole stay in China, and even in the small details (except the mildew around the bath, but it's quite common in all hotels in China apparently...)Only downside : the breakfast room at 18th floor is quite quickly overflowed, and breakfast itself is average (croissants have the consistancy of a spounge)."
32,2323,"Sep 24 2008 	great deal	This hotel is fantastic for the price. I paid 580 for a deluxe room with a view of the Pudong. You will read some comments below where people are saying that this is not is a good area. I would absolutely disagree, it's a great area and right in the middle of all the old 30's houses along with what I call &quot;life&quot; going on around you. If you want something more sterile choose one of the more boring areas of town where the have booted all the ordinary Chinese people out in the name of progress.And by the way, those buildings behind the hotel are not a 'shanty town' as one person commented, they the traditional Chinese houses where people have lived for the past 100 years. I went for a walk in there one day and had a great few hours roaming around. (See attached pic). These will be knocked down by next year according to the few people I met who are moving out to suburbia somewhere."
33,2323,"Sep 20 2008 	Don't stay here	The good: Somewhat cheap, although it was more expensive that I thought. I bet you can find cheaper hotels in a better location.The bad: Carpet was really dirty. The shower had mildew growing all over it. Hotel location is far from everything, even a metro stop. We had to walk at least 3 blocks to the nearest metro.Overall, I would not stay at this hotel. If I went to Shanghai again, I would try to stay in the French Quarter. This hotel was too dirty and far away from everything."
34,2323,"Sep 19 2008 	Great Hotel!	Great hotel, friendly staff with passable English and a GREAT location. While the immediate surrounding area is nothing to write home about, the hotel is only two blocks from a Metro station and the main downtown area on this side of the river. You can definitely walk to the Bund, but it's probably about 20 minutes. Great value too!"
35,2323,Sep 7 2008 	A nice hotel	Leaving China I had to fly out of Shanghai so I stayed at the riverside for one night. I wish I could have stayed here longer.A nice room for a good price.
36,2323,"Aug 16 2008	Fine but there are better located hotels	The rooms in this hotel are very nice, large and spacious with a good bathroom. No complaints whatsoever about the room. The location of the hotel however is not exactly fantastic. It is only a short walk to Nanjing Road and about 15minutes to the Bund.However, if I was staying in Shanghai again I would prefer to stay in the French Concession as it is a much nicer area with a nicer atmosphere. The Riverside Bund is somewhat on a side street with a lot of hardware shops and run down flats. The breakfast is terrible! Honestly, don't waste your money on it. Overall, we were happy with our stay in this hotel. The staff were EXTREMELY helpful and spoke decent English (do not underestimate how important this is in China). It was relatively cheap (41 for double room) for such a nice hotel."
37,2323,"Jun 5 2008	Great location and good hotel	We visited shanghai on our last leg of the china tour at the end of May 08. We've been to many 4-5 star hotels on the trip in Beijing, Xi'an, Suzhou, Guilin. This one in Shanghai is one of our favorites. The location is great -- walking distance to Nanjing Road and the Bund Riverside. There're also some interesting local streets nearby where you can find food stands, convenient stores and just local life all day long. The breakfast buffet was great, although someone on our tour claimed to have got food poison from uncooked bacon at the omelet bar. Our room on the 11th floor was really clean, probably newly remoded. It's not big, but suffient. It has a gorgeous view over the bund and the high rises on the east side. In the evening, everything's lit up and it's beautiful. The TV has many channels to choose from including a number of english channels like CNN. Overall, we'd definitely stay here again when we come back to Shanghai on our own."
38,2323,"May 18 2008 	Nice hotel in good location	The hotel is in very good condition, room was very clean and furnished in an elegant modern style with flat-screen tv. Located close to Nanjing Road (main shopping street).Hotel staff is helpful and English speaking (more or less). Breakfast was really great with a large choise of different dishes. The panoramic window of the breakfast room offers a nice view.Whenever you go by taxi you need to have the Chinese address with you. At the reception desk you get a biz card where the address of the hotel as well as the most important tourist attractions are mentioned in Chinese. Take it with you, it's really helpful!"
39,2323,"Apr 18 2008 	Very dissapointed with the Bund Riverside Hotel....	Having stayed at the Bund Riverside hotel before, I decided to book it again for my next business trip.I hate to say that the service and hotel have really gone backward since the last time.The internet speed for a start is a joke, as is the 1RMB per minute charge.Breakfast is very poor, the croissants tasted like they had been there for 3 days, there are not enough seats for all the staying guests to have breakfast, so one has to cue until someone leaves.The noise with all the construction work going on outside is unbearable and carries on through the night.The aircon doesnt work, which trust me in Shanghai's muggy climate is a must.There was no hot water, so I had a cold shower on both mornings.The front-desk staff were not helpful when all the above problems were pointed out and are only there to check you in and check you out, dont ask for anything else.In conclusion very poor and I wont be staying at the Bund Riverside next time."
40,2323,"Apr 9 2008 	Great location and pleasing stay for a first visit to China	This was our first vist to China, taking in Beijing, Dalian (business part of the trip) and Shanghai. I cannot understand the negative comments from some reviewers. We have travelled many parts of the world extensively and while this is not the best hotel we've stayed in, it is far from the worst! We were fortunate to get a great room high up with super views over the Huangpu river and the skyline featuring the landmark Pearl TV tower - smog permitting. We spent part of the two evenings we were there sipping some Great Wall Merlot while gazing out from our room window over the superb views and watching all the shipping traffic on the river. The room was clean, the front desk staff friendly and extremely helpful. Cannot comment on the food as we did not eat at the hotel, there is a wide choice of resturants in nearby Nanjing Road.We would certainly stay at the Bund again. One word of advise, try and get a room high up (for the view and to minimise the traffic/construction noise) and one that overlooks the river."
41,2323,"Jan 8 2008	Good stay in a central hotel	Stayed here during an escourted trip round China in Sept 07. Overall a good hotel with nice rooms but most of all in a convenient location. Only a few mins walk from Nanjing Road which is the main shopping thoroughfare. If you like shopping this is the place to go with modern shopping centres and high quality western type shops. The hotel is also only 5 mins walk from The Bund, the famous riverside walkway.However, dont be expecting some romantic riverside view from your window ! We overlooked a tributary of the river which wasnt particularly nice too look at, mainly because of the shanty town the other side of the river ! Have to say they were demolishing it all and probably by the time you read this there is likely to be a beautiful high rise building it its place. With the speed the buildings go up in Shanghai, there was probably a high rise by the time our airplane took off from Shanghai Intl airport !Overall a very smart clean hotel located centrally. Staff (as always in China) were extremely helpful. Tip: Take one of the hotels cards. On the back it has all the main tourist sites in English &amp; Chinese. Just tick where you want to go and show the taxi driver ! Quick, easy and cheap !! (taxis are so cheap !!)"
42,2323,"Jan 6 2008 	Ok but don't bother with the breakfast!	We went to this hotel as it was the one that had the best reviews within our budget and was located very centrally.And we weren't disappointed. We got a cheap online deal at U$85 a night excl. breakfast. For the money I have no complaints. The hotel rooms are located on the higher floors of the hotel (11th?-17th). The lower floors are conference rooms, popular for weddings so you will probably run into a bride.Our room was the standard double which was probably quite a small room for the hotel standards (25m2 incl bathroom). It still had a queen sized double, TV with 5 English language channels including BBC and CNN, mini bar, desk, decent sized wardrobe with sadly Chinese sized bathrobes and an ok bathroom with the usual soap, shampoo, shower cap and something you don't find usually: condoms! In 2 sizes even!!. Made us laugh! The room and bathroom were cleaned everyday.Our view was of Suzhou creek. Sounds nice, looks crap. They are tearing down the entire old neighbourhood to build more skyscrapers. (Very typical and sad, happens all over Shanghai). They start doing that at 7AM and the windows aren't double glazed so you do hear that in the background (even if you are on the 12th floor). Also the walls are not very thick so you will hear somebody's tv as a murmur too. As I always wear earplugs neither bothered me too much. Breakfast is not included and if you are smart (or on a budget) you pick up something small like yogurt from the corner shop across the road and then have a proper meal later one. Eating out is very cheap in China. If you do have breakfast in the hotel you have two options. For U$8 you can have a standard English/continental breakfast on the top floor. It is ok but not brilliant. And the coffee is not good. The downstairs lounge/cocktail bar is better, you order good club sandwiches or another snacks from their menu. Not that cheap for either Chinese or Western standards though.Staff tried to be helpful but not everybody speaks English very well, or at all. Which can be a bit tiring but is very typical for China.In the end, with some pointing at words in my dictionary or travel guide, we usually got there. What is very useful though, is that they will provide you with cards which have the hotel address in Mandarin, a number of useful phrases and will write down to whatever address you need to go in Shanghai.Location is pretty good, a 5 minute walk from East Nanjing Rd and the Bund. The shortcut alley to E Nanjing Rd looks a bit dodgy, especially at night as it has few street lights, but we were totally safe. The alley also has some corner shops which is easy for snacks. We took cabs everywhere because they are incredibly cheap and available 24/7."
43,2323,"Jan 2 2008 	Disapointing	Don't believe the name of this hotel, it may be on a riverside but isn't on the Bund. Its about 10 minutes walk away. We stayed for 4 days.The room would of been ok, all the normal amenities but the carpet was stained and flithy which was very offputting. Everything else was clean.Breakfast was served on the top floor which had a fantastic view but the buffet itself was disappointing. Limited choice, which wasn't replenished and barely warm. I decided to skip the buffet and go to the egg station, big mistake! The chef had no idea how to cook an omlette and I got a pile of seperate bits of yolk and white. The fried egg was no better, burnt on the bottom but not even warm on the top. There is a cafe on the ground floor which does basic snacks which was better but at an extra cost. We skipped breakfast and ate out after trying breakfast and never tried an evening meal.The reception staff were pleasant and helpful, writing down destinations and getting taxis etc.To sumarise, this isn't a horrific hotel but I wouldn't go back, I think there are better options in Shanghai."
44,2323,"Dec 7 2007 	Would NOT stay here again	Avoid this hotel at all costs!The service desk personnel, except for the trainees, were awful: I was told that last tourist street map was given to the person immediately in front of me only to witness the same map provided to another patron just two minutes later. Another woman in our party, who spoke fluent mandarin, went to the front desk to exchange currency, at first only the large bills were provided to her. She then asked about the balance and Ms Chrise Wang, the front desk attendant, said that she would provide the balance after our friend signed the receipt. Our friend signed the receipt and Ms Wang proceeded to short change her again!! Our friend summoned the day manager to correct the problem  useless: Our friend did not receive the balance due to her and Ms Wang only signed the customer receipt and conveniently did not sign the hotel copy of receipt. We checked out after the second night instead of staying for the third.Except for the lobby, our hotel room and the interior were worn far beyond its age of only four years  the graffiti on the on the hotel exterior was the first bad sign. The one public internet computer is shares a fax machine on a crowded counter behind the concierge  no privacy and it cost 1 Yuan/minute. The hotel is also quite removed from Nanjing Road and the other clean westernized hotels.Our hotel experiences really took away from our overall enjoyment of Shanghai. We regret not having to check out some of the other tripadvisor reviews of this hotel - we would not have chosen this location."
45,2323,"Dec 2 2007	Fantastic hotel great location	Great hotel, thumbs up here.This hotel is approximately 50mins from airport to hotel. Give or take the traffic can be a nightmare.Reception staff are really friendly and the service was with a smile cant fault it.The lifts were in working order, my room had a queen size bed, the bathroom was great had internet access if you needed it (must have your own notebook to do this) downstairs you had the chance to go to the business room if you needed the internet).My view out of the hotel was partial river and the other half was facing another apartment block. Push the blinds accross!! Great Location this hotel is approx 10 mins from Nanjing road shopping district. walk straight down the road and your in heaven!!So many shops !! it is seriously a shoppers paradise. One thing to be careful about is you will find many locals selling items which are either fakes or try to persuade to go down dodgy alley ways, consider this a warning whatever you do say NO. By agreeing to go with them, you are not thinking of your safety. There are many pick pockets and theives around nanjing road make sure you have a shoulder bag around the front of you. If you have a backpack make sure it is at the front of you at all times.This hotel was very handy and warned us about this problem that happens in the shanghai area. They were truely out there to help us.Breakfast is western size, a huge variety of cheeses and breads was in love with it!!!This was my favourite hotel in Shanghai, i could stay here again.I rate this hotel as an 4 star."
46,2323,Nov 13 2007 	Great location and facilities	We had been to Shanghai in the previous 12 months so were better prepared this time to select a hotel in the best location to optimise our 4 day stay. We were not disappointed with the Bund Riverside.After 15 hours travel the spacious area of our suite (Room 1218) was most welcoming. The huge king size bed had beautiful bed linen and although the mattress was very hard (it seems the norm for China) we both had a great sleep each night.The extra space was a bonus and the huge windowsills were great to dry our washing!!The bathroom was quite luxurious and the 4 bath towels in the room each day was an added bonus when you need to wash your hair. The shower nozzle was great and easy to adjust. There was plenty of room on the vanity unit to leave both sponge bags spread out. The bath was huge and there was plenty of room to soak after a hard day sightseeing.There was a good size television in both the bedroom and the sitting room. Controls were easy to work out and in addition to the Chinese channels there was also BBC World and CNN. There was a large flatscreen computer on the desk in the sitting room and it was easy to connect to broadband (after the willing assistance of 3 staff - the cord wasn't plugged in!!) Connection was 100Y for 24 hours. There was a bad stain on the carpet - it looks as if someone had spilt red wine. The whole carpet in fact looked as if it needed a good shampoo.Breakfast was included as part of our tarrif and there was an excellent selection of Asian and Western food. The egg chef cooked a great omlette while you waited. I still cant quite get used to other diners smoking while they eat at the adjoining table. We also had lunch in the cafe near reception - nice but quite expensive in comparison to other meals we had across the city.The location was what attracted us to the hotel in the first place and we were not disappointed. It was only a 5 minute walk through to the eastern end of the Nanjing Road shopping mall and the Nanjing Metro Station and a 15 minute stroll to the Bund. Although it was quite dark around the hotel at night and there was nothing open we felt very safe at all times.I would be quite happy to stay here again. Can't comment on the standard rooms and although the suite was expensive ($A245 per night bed and breakfast) it was a luxury I would be quite happy to repeat.
47,2323,"Nov 2 2007 	Run down but cheap	The location is very good and the price is OK too. However it's an old hotel and the rooms are small and run down.My room was also next to the lift and quite smelly. I found it unusual that they charge (hefty) for broadband internet use, which is usually free in China.I would probably not stay again."
48,2323,"Oct 9 2007	Location Location Location!	We concluded our 2 week sightseeing tour of China with a stay at the Riverside Bund. Our time in Shanghai included a day of leisure on our own and the hotel's location was perfect from the vantage of getting around easily (especially since the days before National Hoiday made getting a taxi impossible). Just a few minute walk to Nanjing Road, a happening 24/7 and an easy walk to People's Park (Shangahi Museum, Urban Planning Center) and the Bund, a great place for dinner), For the more adventurous, a walk across a nearby bridge, finds you in an where the locals shop. So, something for everyone a convenient walk away!We stayed in a room on the 15th floor with one of the best views of the city. Imagine our delight at seeing a fireworks display on the Bund from the comfort of our own room on two successive nights! We found the room to be very comfortable and the beds a little softer (more western style) than some of the other hotels in which we stayed. Breakfast , while a more limited buffet, included custom omelets and soft, freshly baked rolls, reminiscent of home.Overall, the hotel was a very nice end of our trip!"
49,2323,Sep 28 2007 	great location	My husband and I are both travel agents and have stayed in many hotels around the world. This wasn't our favourite but it did have it's good points.The location is excellent - 5 min walk to Nanjing Road where there is plenty of shopping and underground stations. One stop on the underground to the other side of the river to get you to the TV toweretc. There are also 2 mini-marts close by to get snacks and cheap bottled water etc.The room was good as well - good size and the bathroom was a good size as well - only shower no bath.We found the beds the whole way through China to be very hard - this was not much different.Our only 2 issues were the staff. At breakfast they were not very attentive and the front counter - at concierge asked for a map and he had no idea what I had asked for - check in staff were fine though.
50,2323,Sep 18 2007 	not good	Stayed here 9th September. I had previously stayed in hotels in other areas of China and was quite impressed by the quality and standards of the hotels.First impression of this hotel was that it was grand until I reached my room which was quite small and very dull. There was no place to rest a suitcase and no room to walk about. the bathroom was practically in the bedroom.My main irk was that the room was not properly serviced dirty glasses were left and cups not taken away although the bed was made.The srevice at breakfast was no better as the staff seemed to ignore guests.The reception staff were unhelpful and kept carrying out other duties while I was trying to get help from them.If I was going to Shanghai again I would not stay here.The nicest thing about it was the glass lift which we used on a fea occasons!!
51,2323,"Sep 10 2007 	Nice hotel	We booked a superior river view no smoking double room for a total cost of 74$ a night.The room, at 11th floor, was fairly large and very clean. The bed was a bit hard but soon find out that it is a standard in China. Toilet supply was fine and there are more items you can buy for a small fee. They supply 2 free small bottles of water every day.There were construction works near the hotel but the room was very silent.We had an impressive view from the window.We took maglev from Pudong airport and then subway to East Nanjing Road. Hotel is about 200 meters from the station. The location is good for Nanjing Road and the Bund, both walking distance. We used the subway to get to the other attractions.The reception was ok, the smiling trainee who received us (supported by a more expert collegue) was very nice and spoke good English."
52,2323,"Jul 30 2007	Sweet Suite was worth the price	The Bund Riverside is a 3* hotel within an easy walk of the Bund and Nanjing Lu (pedestrian shopping street). Great location, set in a neighborhood that held no excitement (auto/machine parts) but seemed safe.My sisters and I splurged on a suite on the 17th floor for $150 per night and IT WAS SO WORTH IT. (regular rooms are OK, not large like our suite). Our view to the river and the Bund/Pearl Tower was DEAD ON from the big curved window (with a windowseat) in the bedroom. The suite was a very decent size. The living room was comfortable with a sofa, chair , TV and enough room to put a rollaway bed. (living room view was of the neighborhood).Bedroom held a king sized bed, comfortable enough (firm but not ungiving mattress), nicely decorated, and the large bathroom held a small stall shower and a big soaking tub. Breakfast ($8 per person addt'l) was OK, nothing exciting/nothing Asian, but great views from this top floor of the hotel. Airconditioning never got really cold but we didn't mind, it was cool and comfortable.All in all, a great value for great space. While the lobby is unimpressive (tiny), the staff was helpful (limited English spoken) and polite. Taxis were easy to hail and walking to Nanjing Lu took 5 minutes through the local neighborhood."
53,2323,"Jun 22 2007 	Better hotels for your money	We stayed here from 7 June 07 for 4 nights. This hotel is quite central, however, you do have to walk up a dark street at night to get to the hotel. I felt perfectly safe as China is a very safe country, however, it could be very intimidating if you were alone. There was also work being carried out on the main pathway, which madeit slightly darker and dingier.  The reception area is very nice, the reception staff are friendly, but their English is very poor (although in fairness, my Mandarin isn't as good as their English!) however, the English in Shanghai is very good in comparison to Beijing. Our room was 1101 and was tiny, there was no where to put one suitcase, let alone two. I had mine on the dressing table &amp; my husband had his on top of the chest of drawers as there was literallyno floor space for a suitcase to sit, there wasn't even a suitcase stand in the room.  The carpet badly needed replaced, it was 50% covered in very old stains. After the first night in the room at a scorching 27C, I spoke to reception in the morning to report a fault with the air con. They said they would have it sorted for us coming back that night, however, when we returned the thermostat had been turned up to 25C, so I put it right back down again, but the room was no cooler. I went down to reception to report it again &amp; someone came up &amp; 'fixed' it. The following morning after another sleepless night I went and spoke to the manager. She claimed it was to save energy the rooms wouldn't get any cooler than the outside temperature! She agreed to allow us to move rooms as a bigger room would allow the air to circulate better.  Our second room 1318, was slightly bigger, although not much cooler but their was space for at least one suitcase on the floor, however, this floor was also filthy. Other than the carpet, the room was fairly clean.  The hotel also have a board up with the exchange rates, however they don't exchange travellers cheques, they will only give you Yaun from a credit card payment! Every other hotel in Shanghai exchanges travellers cheques for their guests except this one. The location was quite handy, and the hotel was cheap, however, I wouldn't stay here again. It was a 2 min walk to Nanjing Road and 5 min walk to The Bund &amp; the underground."
54,2323,"May 16 2007 	Good combination of price and quality	We stayed at this hotel for 4 days in May 2007 . It is not cheap according to Chinese standard fares, but it is worth spending money. Great location, that allows you to reach main tourist destinations in just a few minutes, nice window view of the city (we lived on the 16th flow). Rooms are rather big, well decorated and clean. The breakfast is rather expensive and it may well be skipped, but for those who want to drink a cup of coffee overlooking the river and skyscrapes - come to breakfast room at the 18th floor. The plus is that they serve european breakfast and have nice juices.Be aware that if you haven't paid in advance for the hotel, they will ask you for the deposit (the sum of the whole payment). When you check out they give it back or change the necessary sum of them.Look carefully at the service tax. It is 15% there and is not inluded in the room fare. At least we reserved the room under this condition.On the whole, the hotel is great! Nice for business and holidays.And increadibly cheap comparing to such level of european hotels."
55,2323,"Apr 23 2007 	Value hotel	This is a value hotel, you get what you paid for. Nothing fancy, just O.K. decent sized rooms,O.K. lobby, hallways are darkwood paneld, the beds are hard, The carpet had some stains on it. The soap and shampoos are not individual sized, just a built in in the shower, also there is a fee for all their amenities, the toothbrush, comb etc in the bathroom are not included, there is an addtional charge. The front desk speaks minimal English, the area is safe, not tourist shopping, this is the area for industrial supply stores. 10 minute walk to the Qipu shopping mall."
56,2323,"Apr 13 2007	Average but inexpensive hotel	Average but relatively inexpensive (for Shanghai standards) hotel a few minutes walking distance north of the East Nanjing Road. The neighbourhood of the hotel consists almost exclusively of stores selling auto parts, tools, plumbing supplies etc. These shops close early in the day, and then the streets surrounding the hotel get pretty dark and somewhat spooky. However, the streets are busy during the day, and the East Nanjing Road with its bright shopping malls is only minutes away.The staff is friendly, and our room on the 16th floor was clean but somewhat small. The bathroom was large with a huge shower cabin. We were upgraded to river view free of charge (river view rooms are considerably more expensive than the standard city view rooms) and had a good view over the Huangpu river, the Pudong skyline with the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the Suzhou creek.The breakfast buffet is OK but nothing to phone home about (bread rolls, butter/jam, eggs, bacon, some vegetables, noodles, fruit, congee). Coffee in the lobby cafe is quite expensive; we payed RMB 88 for two mediocre Cappucini."
57,2323,"Apr 1 2007 	never again!!!	as simple as this: we were in our room at 10pm when a noise started. After dealing half an hour with reception, they told us that the carpet in the restaurant in the highest floor was being replaced, &quot;but they will finish at midnight&quot;! well, after complaining without result, they finish at 1:30am. The morning after, the manager of the hotel offered us 20USD because it wasnt a big deal, then they didnt make noise the whole night.... in a very unpolite and despective behaviour. Well, the real problem is that they dont care, and you can complain further, so be lucky in your stay or you will regret for hours having chosen this hotel. In my opinion is better to book an international hotel in Pudong or somewhere else near subway, which works perfectly and its very easy to get through.I needed to share my worst experience ever in an hotel."
58,2323,"Mar 9 2007 	Top value for money	After a lot of research I found this hotel to offer the best value / location ratio in Shanghai. It is extremely central but only cost US$70 per night. Located around 5 minutes walk from the Bund, 5 minutes from Nanjing Road and its metro station, this is a brilliant location. Much more preferable to being stuck out in Pudong in the Hyatt or Shangri-La.The hotel has a very helpful concierge and nice cafe for breakfasts. The room was a very respectable size with massive shower cubicle and all mod cons. I will definitely stay here next time I'm in Shanghai."
59,2323,"Jan 26 2007 	Great place to stay	This was my last night in China after enduring some pretty ordinary service and accomodation but I honestly thought that this place was great.Moderately priced, beautifully appointed, perfectly located for the Bund, Nanjing Rd and the Metro.Would definitely stay there again."
60,2323,"Nov 26 2006	Nice Hotel good location	This hotel is fine the view from some of the hotel windows is absolutely fantastic (see photo), the bar on the top floor lacks any atmosphere but we were in a big group so we used to go into one of the private bars and enjoy the scenery. The location is fine (altough it is a good 7 minute walk to the Bund). It is definitely well worth it particularly at night for the lights and also in the morning to see everyone doing their exercises. It's about 10 minutes walk to the Nanjing Road, which is great for shopping and once again the lights at night are fantastic. Shanghai is an amazing city so Enjoy!!!"
61,2323,"Nov 10 2006 	Great Hotel	Spent 4 nights at the Bund Riverside, We found the position was excellent, just 2 streets away from the hub, but easy walking distance. About a fifteen minute walk to the Bund.The staff were very pleasant and helpful, reasonable amount of english spoken. We asked for an upgrade and got it! The room was well appointed and very clean and comfortable. The exchange rate in the hotel was as good.Would stay again at this hotel without hesitation."
62,2323,"Oct 19 2006 	Very nice hotel	This hotel is also known as the XinXieTong Hotel and the New Xie Tong Hotel.It has a great location 5 mins walk from Nanjing Road and 10 mins walk to The Bund, admittedly your 5 mins are a walk through a street with workshops and locals working on tools and machines, it is safe just not very glamorous!The hotel lobby is small with a few seats to relax and a bar off to the right, it is bright and clean, with plenty of marble, they turn the lights down at 11.30pm!There are 4 lifts, the one in front of you when you walk towards them is a scenic one, with a great view over the suzhou creek.The hotel corridors are very swish and stylish, the room also is of very good quality, a good size, even though I guess we were in the cheapest rooms, we had 2 double beds, which were comfortable and good linens, 2 chairs to sit and a table, TV, inroom safe, kettle, tea and a large windowsill that 2 people could completely sit on and look out over the Suzhou creek and Shanghai. Also in the room are slippers, plenty of towels and dressing gowns. The bathroom was massive (for a bathroom) well stocked, there was alsorts of items in the room all with a price on, if you wanted them. There were 2 complimentary bottles of water in the bathroom.The restaurant/breakfast room was on the 18th floor, with a fine view over to Pudong. Breakfast consisted of cereals, milk, yoghurts, fruit, cut up bananas, bread and a toaster, cooked items and a chef cooking eggs, as well as Chinese items.

Our room was clean, and had the usual amenities; we were happy to find bathrobes and slippers. The only negative was that the coffee maker didn't work, and wasn't fixed, even though we had alerted the staff. Views of Pudong and the Suzhou canal were spectacular from our tenth floor room. Breakfast in the top floor restaurant was buffet-style, with a good mix of western and eastern items, including an omlette bar. The hotel is well-located, being steps from Nanjing shopping street, and a metro stop."

1,2324,Great Hotel - Highly recommended	Stayed here in July 2009 for 3 nights on a business trip. The room is spacious and clean. The bathroom is beautiful with great view. Excellent service.
2,2324,"Nov 11 2009 	Great Hotel	I loved this hotel. Very modern with a great room and fantastic views of the Mao tower or the river , depending on your room location. I stayed 3 times in 2 weeks, so I say 3 different rooms. All were to a very high standard. The subway is just across the road and taxis are cheap so the location should not be a problem for tourists. Breakfast was also very good, with a good choice of &quot;european&quot; food."
3,2324,"Nov 10 2009 	very happy with choice	We arrived very late but service was excellent. Although we did not plan to have breakfast, we decided to try it. It was amazing! Something for all tastes. We had a standard room but there was nothing else to wish for. A wonderful wetroom! View onto the river.On the other side is the Metro and also busconnections into all areas. Wonderful! But even taking a taxi doesn't cost the world. A great hotel that is a real bargin for the price!We used the swimming pool and the sauna and enjoyed it immensly."
4,2324,Nov 6 2009 	Excellent facilities - friendly staff	I stayed here for 8 days when I was visiting family - Hotel is very nice but a little bit out of the way. Saying that the underground is directly across the road from here and it is by far the best way to get round the city. The underground is very modern with a train every few minutes- most we had to wait was a maximum of 5 minutes. If you do not want to use the Underground you can use taxi's which are also very cheap. A run into the city centre was only about 1200RMB ( about 1.20) Hotel itself is very nice with a lovely swimming pool and Gym / steam rooms. there is a choice of 3 restuarants - we visited the Cantonese one in the restuarant and were not really impressed with the food but it was probably because it was different than what we are used to in a Cantonese restuarant at home. The staff in the hotel were very good - room service etc was quick and affordable- Rooms are nice with a glass partition between the bathroom and the bedroom so if you want you can lie in the bath and watch the Tv (Movie channels &amp; news channels in English )I would certainly go back here but it is a little bit quiet just outside the hotel but 5 mins in a taxi and you are in the financial district where there is plent life.
5,2324,Oct 9 2009	Great hotel but out of town	Lovely hotel with fabulous rooms .Lobby bar a bit lacking in atmosphere.Good breakfastLovely swimming pool.Long way from any attractions but near the metro
6,2324,"Oct 4 2009 	Excellent 5 star hotel - poor location	The reason the Eton gets rated so highly is because its an excellent 5-star hotel at a 3-star price. Many of the reviewers are unaccustomed to it and are bowled over by the experience. And the experience is good. The problem is the location. If you need to be there then that's OK, but otherwise it's a long way from the centre. Wanting some beer and snacks I asked directions and headed off: after 5 mins I had passed empty offices, empty plots, two very seedy brothels and a run down looking noodle place, before finding the &quot;supermarket&quot; stocked with out of date strange brands and very dimly lit - like something from Moscow circa 1991. All very un-Shanghai. Yes the underground is opposite the door, but those trains only travel every 20 mins most of the time, and you will always have to change at the next stop. Going out to a bar? - that'll be 15mins in a taxi. The whole area is being rebuilt - streets being torn up and many building sites - but even when they've finished the Eton will be in a poor location."
7,2324,"Sep 26 2009 	Excellent hotel - too far off the action	Excellent 5 star hotel located in Pudong. Outstanding room. Unfortunately, the hotel is located approximately one mile from the tourist attractions in Pudong. Not much in the hotel neighbourhood due to construction ongoing on Pudong Avenue. Metro (subway) located across the street."
8,2324,"Aug 21 2009 	best hotel of shanghai!!!!	All in the hotel is superb...EXcellent pool, incredible rooms with 3 lcds TV, incredible views and location, great lobby , enormous buffet breakfast, excellent service....It has the best executive lounge that I have ever been.I will remember always how smells the hotel, it is a mix of roses and orchyds....absolutelly incredible...A paradise on earth...."
9,2324,"Jul 29 2009 	Very Good	A very nice hotel. The room looked new and elegant. Service was good and breakfast was good with a large selection.Location just ok as it was a bit far from the citycentre, but taxi is cheap so we didnt mind."
10,2324,"Jul 29 2009 	Very good will be staying here from now on	I travel to Shanghai for work about 7-8 times a year. I usually stay at The Barony which is just down the road from The Eton. I got a really great rate at The Eton and was able to stay here this trip...what a difference between the 2 hotels! The room was great, the gym and pool were great. The spa was a little on the pricey side but I always go to the DragonFly Spa just a 10 minute walk from here on ChangYi rd. I ordered room service a couple of times...it was good. The breakfast was great, lot's to choose from. The only thing that I didn't like was that they apply a 15% surcharge to everything here.Other than that, no complaints. Whenever I go back to Shanghai I will be staying at The Eton from now on."
11,2324,"Jun 23 2009 	Always great	I travel to Shanghai every 3 months and The Eton is always where I end up. From my experience, there are no other hotels in Shanghai (Puxi or Pudong) that offers a better or similar combination of price and quality.I typically stay in an Executive room, which includes a great quality breakfast on the Executive floor (with a great view of the city) and free internet access, amongst other things.The staff is very courteous and employees will go out of their way to make sure you have a great stay. While most employees speak some English, communication can be a bit arduous at times. But that is true for all hotels I have been to while in China, including American-owned hotels.The rooms on the Executive Floors are great: very clean, bed is comfortable, work area adequate, nice size LCD TV mounted on the wall. The only complain I have is that the shower pressure is very average.As many people have mentioned, there is a metro station very nearby (less than 5 minutes walk). There are a few corner stores/groceries around if you want to buy your own snacks and save some money. As far as dining goes, you will not find many good restaurants at a walking distance; but a 10 minutes taxi ride will bring to other areas (such as the Times Square), where you have plenty of options for a great dinner. I have tried mainly western-style food from The Eton, and although it was acceptable, there are much better alternatives a few kilometers away. So if you're tired and want to relax, don't worry: ordering room service will be okay. But if you're feeling good, I suggest you go out.I strongly recommend this hotel, and will definitely go back."
12,2324,Jun 11 2009 	Wonderful contemporary luxury hotel	Great hotel for business or leisure travel. I have stayed at this hotel 5 times in the last year and the hotel is superb. The rooms are beautiful with great vies of downtown Shanghai.
13,2324,"Jun 9 2009 	Excellent hotel	I stayed at this hotel for one night last year for my birthday. We lived about 1 hour away and unfortunately forgot our passport which was obviously a major problem. The staff were extremely helpful and understanding, and let me wait in the executive lounge with free refreshments while we waited to resolve the problem. When we eventually made it to our room, I was very impressed. The bathroom was simply amazing and as we had an executive room we were able to have free refreshments in the lounge whenever we wanted, including cocktails, ice cream and canapes during the cocktail hour. The swimming and spa facilities were also impressive."
14,2324,"Jun 6 2009 	How it could be that someone is positive about this hotel !!	My Chinese partner and I did checked in in this hotel May 12 2009 and did leave the hotel again within 1 hour. The hotel looks moderate from the outside and the hallway and lobby are looking great; but the staff shows no happynes or willingness to do their job good at all. The bathroom is twice as big as in other hotels and looks fancy but but the left over space in a normal room became so small, that it is giving no space to be to happy in the room itself. Also the room was smelly.In first view the lobby and stairways in the hotel look impressing, but wit a second look, the decoration is a BAD copy of European-like products. Even the furniture and lightning in the rooms itself, it is all missing a good taste and the perfection. After this worce experience, the operator of Hotels.com did advice us to try the Novotel, what was in all aspects of qualitie, service and value for money 10 times better than that lausy Eton Hotel."
15,2324,"May 30 2009 	Brilliant!	Wonderful hotel, after roughing it for a few weeks backpacking. The service was second to none - special mention to Roland Shi (chief concierge) who helped with arrangements to send a parcel of clothes to the hotel from home - I didn't even have to ask about the parcel when I checked in, it was given to me. The breakfast was all you could want, and the room was fantastic. We took photos of the bathroom for inspiration when we build a new bathroom in our home!! The location is not perfect for tourists, but with taxis so cheap, this should not be an influencing factor when deciding where to stay in Shanghai."
16,2324,"May 29 2009 	brilliant!	we had a great stay at this hotel and wonderful city. conveniently located in pudong, it was easy to reach to the city centre by taxi and the view of the high rises was just stunning both during the day and at night. in terms of design and decoration, the definite Chinese touch in the hotel is a real charm, especially when it comes to the music. =) the rooms were very spacious and clean with excellent amenities. we had room service once and the food exceeded our expectations given that it was western kind of food that we ordered. i definitely recommend this place!"
17,2324,"May 22 2009 	Great hotel location not so much	The hotel in itself is great: all new, beautiful lobby, great spacious rooms with awesome bathrooms. The breakfast buffet also is AMAZING!But, two dark sides: the location first. It is not well located in Shanghai, and even though there is a subway stop right in front of the hotel, as a tourist it was not very convenient. Second, the service. I know this is China but the concierge was bad, the breakfast waiters even worse, and don't even get me started on the service in the cantonese restaurant!But I shouldn't be too picky - this hotel is still a GREAT value for money, with 5* rooms at an affordable price."
18,2324,"May 7 2009 	Great hotel for the price paid	I stayed at this 5 star hotel from April 27th to May 5th 2009. We were 3 people which stayed at the Executive room but were upgraded to the Executive premium room free of charge. Let me begin by mentioning that this in no terms is the most luxuries hotel in Shanghai, this does not mean it is a bad hotel though. This hotel is located in a construction zone due to Expo 2009 being placed in Shanghai, if you want to take the subway to places it is a great location but if you want to be right in the heart of the shopping district you should choose the Le Royal Meridein Shanghai (keep in mind its $1600 more) for our stay so we choose to take the subway to places such as Nanjing Road East which is the biggest shopping district in China, the cost was 4 RMB per person and took around 30 minuites to travel there. Here are the pros and cons of the hotelPros: Hotel price was very decent considering the services that were included. The services were very good buffet breakfast, something called happy hour which goes on from 5pm to 7:30 pm, this happy hour is for executive floor clients and offers all you can eat snaks which we were able to do as our dinner, the drinks are also included on a all you can drink bases, there are various alchol and non alcholic drinks available.The staff are very willing to help considering the lanugage barrier.all in all I would give this hotel 5 stars for value for money, 5 stats for guest services and 5 stars for overall satisfaction.the hotel is great for the bang for the buck, when we reserved our room the hotel had a 30% price reduction through major sites such as travelocity , hotels.ca and expedia.caCons: The room was a bit on the small size, the bathroom was very big but useless big, the tub could accomidate 4 people easily but was not a jacuzi, just a regular huge tub"
19,2324,"Apr 27 2009 	tacky 	stayed there for four nights in april 2009, selected solely on tripadvisor #1 recommendation. i was more than slightly disappointed. it's a good hotel no doubt, but personally i, being in my late 20s, would not rate it anywhere near #1.the view from the 36th floor was nice, the room was super spacious and made with good materials. a tv in the bathroom next to a mirror, and you could see the skyscrapers from the bathtub. we got a smoking room but there was no smell of cigarettes. there was a 7/11 in the same block. downstairs had good wifi that required authentication through a forced redirect page but had all ports open and worked well for free. the atmosphere downstairs was very cheesy, entertainment music played live on grand piano, overpriced white wine and complimentary peanuts you have to pay for. i felt that the staff was hiding behind a fawny &quot;of course sir, yes sir, hello sir&quot; attitude and was not really interested in where we went for dinner and for shopping, etc. an example: after a determined struggle i got the concierge to book us a flight to beijing. given no intervention he would have picked the first on his list despite my special requests. there was a pimp offering his services every night outside the hotel, he was quite persistent even though i told him i'm not interested in his services. he was wearing indoor clothing and emerged out of the blue every time i went to 7/11.this hotel was a good choice for having a nice view at the pudong skyscrapers. there was a metro station right next to the hotel, however the line it was on seemed to be rather peripheric. going anywhere without too much time to spend, you need to take a taxi which will be stuck in the traffic going into a tunnel. it doest cost much but takes your precious time. this is not a downtown hotel from which you can walk to places.that being said, i can recommend this without reservations to those for whom &quot;tacky&quot; and &quot;cheesy&quot; mean &quot;luxurious&quot;."
20,2324,"Apr 17 2009 	Love the Granduer	Excellent Location. Its granduer is worth mentioning. Rooms are very comfortable. Indoor swiming pool, spa service, Gym are very well maintained."
21,2324,"Mar 25 2009 	upmarket	my husband and I stayed at the Eton for 2 nights in April 2008. The hotel is a lovelyand modern establishment. only negatives was beware of staff at spa. They offeredmore than was on the brochure.. and wanted to be paid privately for extras offered. booked a massage and was informed that this was without oils and was to pay the lady privately if i wanted this. other than this, the facilities such as indoor swimming pool, sauna, etc. was fantastic and well run. The Eton, because of its situation(pudong area) is a bit out of the way but the subway across the street will get you to the centre of shanghai very easily. would i go back? yes, probably"
22,2324,"Mar 20 2009 	Great hotel+They made me feel at home!	Stayed for four weeks on a business trip, which can be quite a long time...but surprise: I loved the view from their rooms, the really spectacular bathrooms (the ones with a round bathtube are like your own little swimmingpool) and their breakfast is great, too. Stayed also in the most-expensive hotels in Shanghai, but the breakfast now disappoints me after my experience in the Eton, where you get top-quality for half the price. Everyone of the staff was really helpful and they were so nice to me. Thank you, I really felt at home!"
23,2324,"Mar 20 2009 	A fantastic place to stay in Shanghai	The Eton Hotel is one of the better hotels in Shanghai, and is a good value for the money. The lobby and restaurant areas are clean and bright, and the staff is generally friendly and helpful.The included breakfast is a bit more limited than some of the other hotels in the area, but they more than make up for the decreased quantity with very high-quality offerings, which span from traditional Western breakfast options, to regional dishes. The only gripe I could possibly have is that their sushi options are quite meager. Overall, though, it is a great way to start your day.The rooms are very modern and trendy, with a sleek design and very nice amenities. For those who forget their plug adapters, there are even a few North American outlets provided in each room. The view from the rooms is decent, offering a nice view of the downtown area and the river.Finally, the location is very good! While it is a bit removed from the downtown area (1k or so), it is right across the street from the subway, which despite what the locals will tell you, is an extremely easy and efficient way to get around the city, even for those who do not understand Chinese. For those who don't want to brave the subway, there are ample cabs, which can get you pretty much anywhere for very little money. Just have the hotel staff write your destination in Chinese to help ensure you get where you want to go.For business travelers or techies, there is internet service available for purchase, and the speed is great. Access is somewhat less restricted than in other parts of the country, though access to certain liberal-leaning news sites still appears to be blocked.All in all, the Eton is a good value for a good higher-end room in Shanghai!"
24,2324,"Mar 16 2009 	bad location; dishonest hotel concierge assisting in taxi stand area	hotel itself is clean. we were offered a room with only a single bed when we arrived when we specifically mentioned we wanted two beds when we booked. this was immediately fixed though. breakfast is good.what we didnt like was the one staff who was dishonest to us. a bell boy named chan who was assisting in the taxi cab queue right outside the hotel. as the hotel is far from almost everything taking the taxi was our means of transportation esp since we were travelling with small children. he convinced us to take two cabs instead of one insisting that cabs cannot take in 3 adults and two kids. we later found out that we could take one cab if we let the children sit on our lap. for the amount of money we paid, i think we could have opted for another hotel on the other side of pudong area."
25,2324,"Feb 10 2009 	Not great	Stayed at the Eton for a week in a club room. The Eton suffered from the same problems as all the hotels we stayed in over a month in China, except the problems seemed to be worse at the Eton. This was surprising for Shanghai, where I expected higher standards than elsewhere in hotels catering to the international market.First, the good:The room was modern and fresh, with nice touches like a tv in the bathroom. It was on the small side (Hong Kong size) but this was not a problem. The fit-out of the place seemed a little cheap, but was ok.The pool area was fabulous - nicer than in most top end hotels. The gym was also well-equipped.Breakfast was excellent, the best we encountered in China (although fresh fruit was lacking and the staff were surly - more about that in a minute).Now, the bad:The staff. It seems ridiculous that, everywhere in China, the housekeeping staff are hugely friendly and courteous, and the rest of the staff are either stand-offish or rude. The Eton was no exception, although the reception, breakfast and lobby lounge staff deserve particular mention for rudeness. Even when they did manage to crack a thin smile, the staff were just plain unhelpful. Some examples - the concierge was often nowhere to be seen (and pretty unhelpful too!) so we asked someone at reception to write down a street name for us in Chinese. This would have taken 2 seconds but we were redirected to the (empty) concierge desk. The person in charge of the lobby lounge (where the club drinks and canapes were served) seemed reluctant to serve us and was completely unsmiling and prone to snapping when she did. The list goes on. We visited in January and, unfortunately, our stay coincided with the maintenance and spring cleaning weeks of the year and most of the hotel facilities were closed. We were not informed of this when we booked and we certainly did not get a knockdown rate, so it seemed a little poor. On a practical level, this meant no club lounge (drinks and canapes in the lobby), no business centre for the first half of our stay, and a fairly whopping amount of building noise in our room during the day. The hot water system seemed to be on the blink - the water had to run for 10 minutes or more (I'm not joking) before it would get hot, and even then it wasn't piping hot. Since they turned the water off a few times during our stay perhaps they were fixing it along with everything else.A word on the location - we went with our eyes open to the location and I certainly wouldn't be put off by it. The subway is across the road and taxis to Puxi can be quick depending on the driver. And this is the big catch - taxi drivers in Shanghai seem to have a hell of a time keeping up with all the road closures due to construction of subway lines, buildings, new roads etc, so a taxi ride can easily turn into an hour going round and round in circles if you're not careful. We usually take the subway during the day and taxis at night in big cities but by the end of the week we avoided taxis at all costs. The subway is just easier. There are nooks and crannies in Pudong worth exploring but the whole area around the hotel is basically a construction site at the moment, and a very muddy one at that, so we gave up on walking around.Conclusion - not the most expensive hotel in Shanghai which explains some of the shortcomings. However, the service could easily be improved and apparently this wouldn't cost a thing since the lowest paid staff were fabulous and very friendly. The price of the hotel is comparable to those in many international cities, but the experience is not."
26,2324,"Dec 17 2008 	Loved it	I booked this hotel through Orbitz- received a 3 star price for a 5 star hotel. It was awesome. The hotel was really, really nice. When I got there they were not able to accommodate my request for non-smoking room so I ended up taking a smoking room on a smoking floor- you could not tell it was smoking. There was no smell neither in the room nor on the whole floor. Just amazing. The only downfall was the communication with the staff was a bit tough (maybe it just the culture) but I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to stay in the Pudong area. One advisory- do not plan on eating at the hotel b/c all establishments are really expensive. However, there are many food options in the area within 10-15 min walk as well as as some &quot;special massage&quot; places. P.S. All photos from the hotel website are accurate. Rooms look exactly the same as they advertise."

The check in was smooth and all service people were highly attentive. We were going to bring up our luggage on our own, but the bellman rushed to take it away as soon as we stepped into the hotel. We were greeted with a friendly &quot;hello&quot; whenever we crossed paths with a service person. Very knowledgeable about the area and helpful with calling taxis, etc.The location isn't too central (about a 10 minute taxi ride to the convention center for $2) but there is a subway station directly across the street and the subway system is somewhat easy to understand. There are a couple of nice restaurants/pubs/cafes/shopping in walking distance. There are English translations (some lost in translation) everywhere.We asked for a room with a view and were given just that...although I'm sure most rooms have a view since the Eton's rooms are on the 26th floor on up. Rooms are spacious and modern with two flatscreen TVs (one in the bathroom). Beds are really comfortable and we referred to the bath as a mini pool. Complimentary bottled water is in the room. The breakfast buffet (OH BOY!) is definitely the highlight. Many choices, including Western, Japanese, Chinese, wonderful bakery items. I wish I could have just one more breakfast there...Highly recommended choice for what should be a five star hotel."
28,2324,"Dec 9 2008 	Unbelievable Hotel--So-so location	I stayed here while I attended a conference at the Shanghai International Conference Centre which is only a 10 minute taxi ride (which is cheap: $2USD). Great location for the conference, but not so great for sightseeing although the subway is directly across the street. This hotel is EXCELLENT! Very new--clean, bright and comfortable rooms. Flat screen TV with lots of english channels, but no pay on demand movies. Room service was excellent (although pricey). I booked through expedia for a rate &lt; $150 USD /night and loved it there. I highly recommend going with the access to the lounge and executive floors--the lounge is great--lots of food, snacks and drinks so we never had to worry about getting drinks before we came home (i.e. water, beer, soda, liquor). Also, this deal included breakfast--wow! what a buffet! all types of food--american, asian style and done VERY well. The croissants rivaled those we have had in France. The bacon and eggs are also terrific. Then you can also have what looks like chinese dinner! Lastly, our package included free internet with the executive floors (38-40).Overall, great place, locaton is good for going to the SICC conf centre, but only so-so for touring. 2 nights we had troubles getting a cab back because they were not servicing the Pudong area due to their restricted license (I think?). but the subway is cheap and very accessible. I would definitely stay here again for the 5 star quality."
29,2324,"Dec 6 2008 	My new favorite hotel in Shanghai	I was originally booked at a hotel nearby, but on my arrival day they had a fire and I was rebooked at the Eton Hotel down the road. Lucky me.The location is not as bad as some reviewers make it sound, a taxi to the Bund is less than 5.00, you can walk to the shopping area around the Intercontinental Hotel in 20 minutes. And the views from all rooms are incredible. Floor to ceiling windows will do that!The room is excellent, I would say that the bed beats the &quot;heavenly bed&quot; at the Westin. Soaker tub with a view and a TV in the bathroom. Buffet is up to snuff with the St. Regis and most other international chains in Shanghai. Can't complain about that.Adjacent to the lobby is a coffee shop called Costa Coffee, a Starbucks knock off, in case that you are getting tired of buffet breakfast.Most definitely a great hotel and my new choice in Shanghai.Common areas and fitness centre are clean, inviting and the staff does pay attention."
30,2324,"Nov 20 2008 	Extremely Dissappointing	After reading the reviews for this hotel, I was expecting to be at least mildly impressed. I was not. I got their using the subway and lugged 3 bags to the front door. There were doormen their, but no one opened the door and no one help me with the bags. I had booked the prepaid rates and attempted to put the membership# from their loyalty club on the stay; they wouldn't do it. The english of the lady would check me in was pretty good, so that was a plus. The carpet in the hallways are old and worn and the rooms could use a renovation. The bathroom were OK, but they too could use an update.I ate at the restaurant and the selection was pretty good. One slightly annoying thing was that they kept playing a cheesy muzak, truncated version of Jackson Browne's &quot;The Road&quot; over and over. I guess that's one way to keep guests from overstaying their welcome at the buffett!After several days of eating asian food, I asked the conceirge for a good western restaurant in the area, he recommended Hooter's!All in all, I expected this to be a good hotel after seeing that it had the number position on trip advisor. In my opinion it should be much lower."
31,2324,"Oct 18 2008 	Nice hotel- would stay in a different location	This is a lovely hotel, and the staff are exceptionally helpful and attentive, however the on the day we checked in we were assigned a twin room with 2 single beds when we had booked a double. We were given an upgrade to a larger room with a better view, but if we had been stuck in the first room, it would have been a much more disappointing experience (terrible view of shipyards etc, when you are paying a premium price for that sort of accommodation). The location was our main gripe though, as we didn't realise that although taxis are cheap and reliable (they drive VERY differently- i.e crazy!!!) and I would much have preferred to stay on the BUND or on the other side of the river. There isn't anything in Pudong except shipyards and although the Jin mao tower and sheraton are there they are much closer to the river than the Eton. Every time you want to get anywhere you have to go in a taxi/train under the tunnel to the side of the river where everything is. Next time I would definitely stay in the french concession/bund area- the hotel itself is fine though, but the location is pretty inconvienient and boring if you want to experience the night life and markets etc."
32,2324,"Oct 12 2008 	Best Hotel In Pudong/Shanghai	I have stayed at this hotel for a few months this year, and will not stay at another hotel now in Shanghai. This hotel is the best around. The staff is excellent, so attentive, friendly, and willing to help you with whatever you need. The accomodations are top notch,and if you get a room with the view of the skyline of Pudong/Shanghai, you will be astounded. The rooms are really quite posh, with large tubs (most of them at least), comfortable beds, large TVs, and overall, just a feeling that it's better than whatever other choice you might have made. The service in the lobby is at times a bit much, but that's also just due to you being in a western hotel in China. The location is very nice, right across the street from the subway (line 4, pudong ave), and there are a plethora of taxis. The restaurants in the hotel are what you would expect in a hotel restaraunt, whatever that is. Behind the hotel is quite a pleasant little garden area that you won't think much of until you realize that there really isn't a lot of grass in Shanghai, and that it's a nice secluded area to remove yourself form the hectic-ness of 2 blocks away. It's a block away from the ferry across the Huangpu, and a pretty simple subway ride from the Maglev station.There's a coffee shop next door that caters to the business crowd, and a wine store that appears to have a good selection. You're a short walk or taxi ride from the major mall in Pudong, and all the touristy stuff that side of the river is famous for. You won't be let down at this hotel, I highly recommend it!!!!"
33,2324,"Oct 3 2008 	What a Gem of a place !	Stayed In Shanghai many times and this place really offers not only the best value for money but great rooms and service as welll. Rooms really well appointed, roomy 2 flatscreen, TV's and spotlessly clean. My only single gripe was that they charged a small fortune for internet access. My tip here is to go downstairs into the adjoining costa coffe place where you get free wifi. The cost of the coffee alone only gave you 10mins internet access in your room. Also if you hunt around enough on the net you can always pick a room up there for $150 ish. Try either C Trip.com or otel.com Oddly enough these 2 seem to swing from being the most expensive to cheapest every other month.Have already booked to stay here again and this place will now be my regular stopover in Shanghai. Only downside at present (Oct08) there are roadworks outside which makes access a but tricky for taxis but you could not hear any other the works in your rooms."
34,2324,"Sep 23 2008	excellent hotel	Stayed for 4 nights recently and decided to book an executive room which although a little more expensive than standard room gave me free breakfast in executive floor lounge and also free internet access. Was upgraded to junior suite which was excellent- very comfortable, flat screen TVs in abundance, good desk etc. There are some roadworks outside hotel at present which are not noisy but make access a little difficult for taxi's - make sure that you have hotel address in Pinyin as 2 drivers did not know location of hotel. Very good gym and pool which are hardly used at all, Cantonese restaurant OK, I found all staff to be very helpful and friendly-will definitely stay there again"
35,2324,"Aug 7 2008 	Not quite a 5-star just ok for service	This hotel works OK for a business hotel. Though the location is not very close to anything. I don't know who or how the label 5-star gets decided but I would question that.I was disappointed because my shower kept clogging up. And I contacted the front-desk 3 different times and finally gave up. Supposedly they had fixed it after the 2nd contact, but it was NOT fixed. Tried to explain to them the problem, but no luck.Didn't expect to stand in a puddle of water while showering at a 5-star hotel. And did not want to stick my hands in the drain. I even explained the problem to the manager afterwards, but that didn't help either... not sure he understood everything.The staff speaks english but just enough to give you a welcome. Any deeper issues to be communicated - well good luck getting through."
36,2324,"Aug 3 2008 	The best hotel I ever stayed at!	This is a fantastic hotel! About 4 or 5 restaurants, a bit pricy so we didn't eat in them. But the room rates were so cheap for a 5 star hotel - 65 per room/night! Bargain! It was my birthday and the hotel surprised me with a delcious free birthday cake! How lovely! The spa is excellent! Great pool and lovely treatments, well worth forking out for! Oh and all the bathrooms have city views, ie. glass walls through to the bed room, but don't worry, there are roller blinds for your privacy! :)"
37,2324,"Jul 29 2008 	Great hotel good service and somewhere I enjoy staying	I've been staying at the Eaton Hotel Shanghai since May, and have stayed an average of 4 or 5 nights each time I have been here.I've been in a variety of different rooms, and different floors, and found the hotel to be consistently good. The hotel is modern, with an arty feel to it, and boasts some of the best views of Shanghai.The rooms are comfortable and modern, and have some interesting bathrooms. I've had walk-in showers with full views across the city - large bathtubs with views, and this time around, a bath that would accommodate 2 or more people, with a frosted glass surround. The beds are proper King Size - meaning that I can sleep in comfort despite being 196cm tall, and there's little noise to disturb you either.Breakfast is excellent, with a wide range of foods to choose from, although at peak times it can be a little chaotic and finding a table can be slightly self service. Try and get in before the crowds, and it really is first class though. I have not tried the other restaurants, but the rooms service is good, especially the Cantonese Style Wanton Noodle Soup, which at $11 USD is expensive for Wanton Noodle Soup, but not for a five star hotel anywhere! There are plenty of wontons and plenty of noodles too.The internet is great - works well, and has an excellent multi-lingual 24/7 helpdesk if you need it. None of that nasty free internet that doesn't work here - you pay, but you know why you are paying.Nice touches include the shopping bags provided for you in the wardrobe, and proper suit hangers too.I love this hotel, and would recommend it to anyone. The location is not the best for a tourist perhaps, but as taxis seem to only cost 11 - 33 CNY regardless of where you go, I would not let this put me off."
38,2324,"Jul 28 2008 	sterile business hotel good for business trips - avoid if you're a tourist	We stayed at the Eton with two kids (14,16) for two nights. The hotel is located in Pudong directly at a subway station. Though we had booked two non-smoker rooms we were directed to smelly smokers rooms with ashtrays still present in the room (though a non smoker sign was at the door). After complaining about this the reception offered to set up the room as a non-smoker room - by removing the ashtrays. Great idea! According to the reception other non smoking rooms are not available. We insisted on changing the rooms and - what a wonder - finally got a non smoking room on another level of the hotel.Rooms are just great - marvelous view over Pudong or the river. The bathromm takes half of the room, offering whirl pool and other nice gimmicks. The staff is between indifferent and snobby."
39,2324,"Jul 24 2008 	Excellent Shanghai hotel	In the past, when I have travelled to Shanghai, I have stayed at the Shangra-La. For this latest trip, I decided to find a hotel that was lower priced and still accommodating to the international business traveller. Based on reviews at TripAdvisor, I booked five nights in an executive room at the Eton. This hotel is a gem! Check-in was fast, the base executive room was very clean and modern with more than enough space for my needs. Internet sped was good. The executive floor was quiet and the breakfast and evening appetizers were very good. The steaks at the Chicago Steakhouse were OK and the Eton Cafe was excellent. The staff spoke very adequate English, the concierge was extremely helpful for arranging taxis and transportation. There is a subway station across the street from the hotel entrance for visitors who want to sightsee in Shanghai. The exercise room had most of the equipment that you would find at any exercise club, including treadmills, steppers, weight machines and some free weights. Overall, the hotel is well maintained and the room temperature was comfortable even when the outside temperature was in the high 90's. At this writing, there is a fair amount of street reconstruction going on in the area which delayed traffic a little, but overall it was not a problem. At half the price of the Shangra-La, this hotel is an excellent value for a 4 star+ hotel. I will be returning to the Eton on my next trip to Shanghai."
40,2324,"Jul 24 2008 	Nice hotel but #1 in Shanghai?	Stayed here for a two week break in April of 2008.Booking:My girlfriend happened to have a project in Shanghai that coincided with my holidays so I decided to take them visiting her in Shanghai. If I was going alone I probably would have considered the Eton since it is #1 on tripAdvisor but my decision was made easy as this was where her company put her.Check-In/Check-Out:Didn't have to do anything as I arrived after my gf and left before her. So no comments in that regard. One comment was that I booked the hotel car to take me back to the airport which was definitely worth it. Much nicer than a cab.Room:The room was just a standard room but we were lucky enough to have a view of Pudong which was better than the other views. Everything in the room seemed clean and new. The bed was great, and the circular bathtub is a novelty that was actually used one night. TV &amp; Internet were more than acceptable.Service:Service on the whole was great. The concierge was always helpful for restaurant recommendations, tours, etc. and on the few occasions we had a language issue, they quickly went and got someone who understood. The cleaning staff were great, doing a very thorough job of cleaning the room. It happened to be my gf's birthday while we were there and I had arranged for flowers to be delivered. The flowers were beautiful and very timely with their delivery. That evening when we returned from dinner there was a cheesecake, (not just a piece!) waiting for her from the hotel.Location:This is the area that makes me question how the Eton can consistently be rated #1 in the city. As previous posters have debated, the location is a point of contention. It is basically just on the outside of the downtown business center of Pudong, and as such, it's not overly practical to walk to anywhere. As mentioned there is a subway station just across the street and the subway turns out to be incredibly convenient if you're going somewhere near a stop. Taxi's are also readily available and use their meters always, (only once in all of Shanghai did I have a cabbie tell me his meter was broken), unlike Malaysia, Bangkok, Philippines, etc. where you have to argue a rate, as a previous poster tried to mumble out. Also, they are incredibly inexpensive. However; if you're taking a cab and want to go into the center of Shanghai, (read: across the river), you're looking at a 30 minute ride during peak vehicle times, which can be a pain. Being a tourist, I much would have rather stayed right on Nanjing road, or near the french concession. there are high-end hotels such as le Meridian, Ritz-Carlton, etc. in that area so there wouldn't be THAT much of a quality drop.Facilities:The pool is huge and I rarely saw more than one person in it. The gym is adequate, having more treadmills, (which always seem the most popular), than normal hotels. They even have this odd side to side machine which I've never seen before....and my groin will never be the same again. The concierge desk can arrange tours, tickets, cars direct. The spa is nice but it's China, so expect to be asked for &quot;extra service&quot;. A polite &quot;no thank you&quot; will do. Complaining is pointless, it's like complaining that they serve rice.....it's China, it's normal.Food:The breakfasts were great. Such a huge selection of western, chinese, japanese, etc. foods. It would be really picky/hard to make a complaint about the breakfasts, other than it does get a little busy/noisy at times. Tried the steak restaurant which was good but we found there wasn't a great selection on the menu. The chinese restaurant was great, especially the private non-smoking room, which was so quiet and nice for dinner. I wasn't brave enough to try the donkey meat though. Had room service one night and most of it was good, except for the liver pate which was probably the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted. It had been frozen and wasn't completed thawed.....don't freeze pate at home kids.....Overall:The Eton hotel is one of those rare places that is truly well managed. There is nothing in particular that jumps out and says, &quot;this is what we're really good at&quot; or gives you that &quot;wow factor&quot;, but at the same time, at the end of your visit you'll notice everything was above average for your entire stay and the Eton will only have added to the pleasure of your trip. However; the one thing that the management can't change is the location, which isn't a huge deal, but it's certainly down in the 20's if you're ranking hotels solely on location.If I were to return to Shanghai for another stay I would probably try a different hotel closer to the action, but that's no knock against the Eton as I'd certainly recommend it to people."
41,2324,"Jul 23 2008 	beautiful hotel	beautiful, clean hotel, English is spoken and understood, concierge can book attractions for you, taxis are easy to get, walking distance from Jinmao Tower, location a little far from most attractions but taxi/metro are cheap enough"
42,2324,"Jul 19 2008 	Nice hotel poor location	The Eton is a nice property however it's on the wrong side of the river. If you're in Shanghai on business, I would definitely recommend staying here, but if you're traveling for pleasure-as we were- I would suggest staying where all the action is.It took at least 30 minutes to get anywhere we wanted to go since there's nothing really around the hotel.The rooms are nice and one could get lost in the vast bathrooms. The concierge was very helpful. We had a list of clubs we wanted to see (all in one night) and he set us up with their addresses, set up a car service for us, and we were off and running for the evening.Other than the concierge, the rest of the hotel seemed very impersonal. I can't exactly articulate it... the hotel just felt empty.Like I said, for business (or any other reason you might have to stay on this side of town) the Eton is great.But with the Four Season and Ritz-Carlton (and soon the Peninsula) on the other side of the river, there are better choices."
43,2324,"Jul 16 2008 	Great hotel superb service location not best for tourism	Very nice room and very good service. The hotel is located in Pudong business district, so not great a district as a tourist, but it is also next to a subway station, so it is easy to go wherever you want.The room is very comfortable, very nice design, the swimming pool is huge and the gym is well equipped. Overall an excellent hotel and a good value."
44,2324,Jul 7 2008 	Great Value	You get a perfectly clean room with everything you need. It is certainly not a 5 star hotel in the European sense. It also seems a little strange. But Shanghai just is like that. I can reccommend this house if you are looking for a good value hotel. Friendly staff.
45,2324,"Jun 4 2008 	Visible signs of wear 	We stayed 6 nights, from May 12 to 18. Over all, this is a pretty nice hotel, from the main entrance, lobby all the way to inside the room and bathroom. The highest floor is 40, although my partner and I could only get to stay on the 28th floor, room 2806, the view was still gorgeous. Yes, we could see the Bund too. Across the hotel was the Metro station  problem was, crossing the busy streets of Shanghai was no easy task. It is bordering on dangerous  stop lights or not!All the staff we came in contact with  the bell boys, front desk and housekeeping staff  all friendly and very professional, and most spoke English. Certain parts of the room and the bathroom, there were visible signs of wear &amp; tear, and the ventilation in the bathroom was very, very poor  even after they cleaned it. Air conditioner works well but also needed a cleaning due to the super dirty air in Shanghai, like most of China.If you give Hong Kong or Singapore a 10 out of 10 for shopping, food and transportation, Shanghai would get a 4. As a guide, to me, Bangkok gets a 6 or 7 out of 10 and Kuala Lumpur (KL) in Malaysia gets a 3 or 2. Largely because the taxi drivers in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore (the majority of them anyway) do not rip off their passengers, on the other hand, if you dont get rip off by taxi drivers in Malaysia, consider yourself VERY, VERY lucky!Bottom line: This hotel beats all the hotels I have stayed in my 20+ years of travel, for instance, The Eaton Shanghai stayed at the #1 spot here for months and months, whereas, the Los Angeles Marriots rank has slid down 10 or more since I booked it in March this year!"

I hope to return back soon"
47,2324,May 6 2008	SUPERB hotel	This is very you want to stay in Shanghai!The hotel is fantastic and disregard what others might say - the location is very good. It's a bit away from the center but you have the subway on the other corner and taxis cost close to nothing.Make sure to get a room with a view of the skyline AND book the executive floor!
48,2324,"Apr 6 2008	Good Value Hotel	Stayed for 2 nights on the executive floor of the Eton having spent 1st night in the Shangria la hotel Shanghai.Liked:1. Great room. Modern and clean if not a little small bedroom.2. 2 nights here on exec floor with free breakfast and cocktails and drinks in evening is same price as 1 night at Shangri la.3. Nice gym and although i didnt use it, think theyve upgraded the Spa ( see other reviews re ladies of the night). 4. Good choice of food for breakfast although not in same class as Shangri la regarding food quality.5. 2pm checkoutDidnt like:1. Staff on exec floor nice enough but pretty useless regarding restaurant recommendations for dinner2. Location not the best. Need a taxi to get anywhere really.3. Lot of western (american ) travel groups at breakfast. Not the place for a quiet breakfast !"

The bed is very large and comfortable and we think the room service is very satisfactory.We also tried the dinner buffet there and it was good with reasonable price.The location of the hotel is good and you got the metro station nearby.It 's a highly recommended !"
51,2324,"Feb 6 2008 	another souless hotel in china	We stayed in nov 07 after booking with expedia and getting a great price, we were looking forward to our stay here after all the great review's on trip advisor but were very much let down.after so much travel last year i think my immune system isnt great and my sister who i travel with and myself seem to get everything going and i was i'll the whole time we were there after getting food poisening in the club lounge.We always book the club and this is the most disapointing club iv ever been in, the seats are uncomfortable and you no this is so u won't stay to long, they follow you around constantly but when u ask them to get whatever you wanted you wait a lifetime on them bringing it. i noticed it was different if u were a man in this hotel.Also be very careful letting ur husband go for a massage here as they are offered extra's and hate to take no for an answer. We met 2 different sets of couples that this had happened to, 1 set was a gay couple and both of them had been offered extra's. both sets had complained but had not been given an explanation by the time they had left. I think it says a lot that u cant get room service after 11 but u can have a massage untill 2 in the morning. I really feel this hotel is a lovely hotel and a great price but i would worry about my partner being here alone and as in the case of both couples we met, id worry if i was with them!!If staying here again ( and my sister would throw a fit if i ever sugested it ) i would recomend not booking the club as its not worth the extra money and this is the 1st time iv ever recomended not booking a club room, the room's are very small so id recomend booking a larger room as these dont have club facilities, strangly enough. Also the rooms all seem to have the most awful views, even if its a river view, its all very industrieal in the surrounding area's.This Hotel does have nice products in there bathrooms but there not replinished unless u ask and this was the same of the tea and coffee. Very few staff members spoke english and just smiled and laughed like idiot's if u asked any questions.When we were checking out on the club floor, u had to go to the ground floor 1st and change money as they only except yen but as i was i'll ,i asked if they would sort this out for me and gave them the amount of dollers we had worked out it would be plus $40 extra just incase when he came back it had taken the extra $40 and he said it was still short and when we worked out how much it was short it was 13 pence but he waited on that and as is usual in china u get no change.I would recomend booking the hotel car to take u to the airport its worth the money and a very comfortable drive but strangly if u book it to pick u up at the airport they want you to send them ur credit card details in an email, they dont have a secure site to pay for this service. normally u book it and its added to ur hotel bill. I would recomend not getting a porter at the airport as its such a short walk in from where ur car or taxi lets u off and the porter leaves u at the door and asks for 150 yen for the 20 or 30 yards he pushed ur trolley.All in all this is a good value hotel and its also a nice hotel but the rooms r very small and as i was i'll we used room service a lot and it was consistantly bad and always cold but the seafood buffet was very good and worth every penny paid.The biggest thing letting this hotel down is the lack of service and it would benifit from the managment team staying somewhere else and using it as a learning process, I'd be pretty sure id never stay here again unless the service was greatly improved and the service in the spa was reined in."
52,2324,"Feb 1 2008 	Great Hotel	stayed here 10th Jan for 4nights, after reading reviews, had high hopes and was not disappointed.The rooms were great, we were allocated a room on 37th floor which was very quiet. Corridors, hallway carpets and lifts always looked spotless. Room was excellent, nice big bathroom which had a lcd in it. Bedroom had really comfy beds, wall to ceiling windows, modern fixtures and fitting. Good selection of english tv channels on large lcd tv. Some websites suggest the location is not great, however, i would disagree, there is a subway station across the road from the hotel, and on demand taxis from hotel entrance (excluding 7pm-10pm from experience, whole of shanghai population seem to be queuing for taxis, it was normal practice to be waiting 30-60mins at ALL good hotels) a Costa Coffee literally next door as well as fresh juice bar 4doors away.We used the pool, which i must say was fantastic, 25metre pool located on 4th floor, as glass was tinted one way, you could see the shanghai life outside from the pool area, nice clean and warm changing area. Jacuzzi was not different temperature to pool which was a shame, but this was due to it being linked to main pool so advantage was pool was warm. Gym was also in excellent condition with 2 staff members there all the time and plenty of machines. As hotel was excellent, didn't really have any dealing with front desk except checking in/out where they were efficient. Concierge could of been better, 1guy was very good, however the rest didn't really speak good English and just said yes to our questions. As i am a fairly savvy traveler, i don't really rely on these guys though.Had a snack in lobby lounge which was ok, but a bit expensive for what it was, but i guess you are staying in a 5star hotel. They do offer a seafood buffet which looked good value for what is was, however we didn't try it.If you are a food lover which i am, my biggest tip is try the Shangri-la buffet in the evening, it is simply amazing, the quality of food cannot be surpassed, dim-sum, Italian, every style of Chinese, Thai, Malay, Indian, Western, you name it, they have it, and it all tastes fantastic! you must go there hungry though as its around 300 RMBoverall, i would most definitely stay here again, yes its not on the waterfront for the breath-taking view, but taxis are plentiful and the service is top notch! A great base for Shanghai"

Views for the city are one of the best in entire Shanghai, you can see everything, so if you are the big fan of city's views this hotel is for you. Bellboys are always willing to help and the service is nice. breakfasts are more expensive than in other places but they worth it. Like everybody else who ever stayed in the Eton hotel I can say that it looks very modern and well equipped. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in China. So, I can recommend it to everybody, does not matter if you travel for fun or business. (some areas around it dont look very safety but it's absolutely safety to walk even in them during the late's night time...many restaurants are located there and a lot of massage saloons which offer more than massage service only :) this one for those who like to have &quot;hot&quot; travels :0) So, most of people find what they want staying in this hotel and location is not than bad also. Taxis are extremely cheap and it takes about 15 minutes to get to any most important and interesting places in Shanghai to see. There are only 2 sightseeings which takes us more than 20 minutes to get to. it is Jin Jiang Amusement park and Safari Wild Animals park. All the rest is &quot;just around&quot; the corner. If I ever get back to Shanghai I will stay there once again. No doubts!!!!"
55,2324,"Dec 27 2007 	Exceed all expectations!	I booked this hotel for my 2 nights stay during my recent trip to Shanghai (in fact I just came back home today) after reading all the positive feedback on tripadvisor. I am not a fussy visitor but having been to quite a few hotels, I have high standard for what I would think nice, and it is normally even harder to please my mother. However, dispite having been reading all those positive reviews, this hotel has totally exceeded all our expectations still - the room is new, clean, and stylishly designed. They use good quality furniture, hardware, matress, pillow, toothbrush, bathrobe etc etc. The hotel locates in perfectly in a decent busniss district - just opposite the metro station and next to bus stops. It's no more than 20 - 30 minutes in a taxi to all the attractions (which would be around 20 - 30RMB) if you don't feel like taking the metro. The only few things I would recommand the hotel to improve is that: more smiles on the faces (they are polite and nice but may not be accustomed to smiling a lot) and speakers in the bathroom area (doesn't bother me without tho). I would most defintely stay in this hotel again should I visit the city in the future."
56,2324,"Dec 10 2007 	One of the Best!	I decided to stay at the Eton Hotel for 3 days during my 10 day stay in China based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. I was not disappointed! The room was spacious, very clean and comes equipped with everything you can imagine and more! The views of the city were stunning! Located right across the street from the Pudong Ave metro station and within easy access to the major sights. We either walked or took the subway majority of the time in Shanghai. The only time we took a taxi was to the airport and that was because we had too much luggage and didn't want to drag them on the subway. However, there could've been some improvements. I booked my room through Expedia.ca and arrived around 8pm. We had to wait another 1 hour until we could check in because we were told that the room was not ready. However, we were so hungry so we just went out to eat dinner and came back to check in so it was not too bad. As well, I wish the price could've included internet service. I find the daily rate to be quite pricey at around 120 RMB per day. Instead, we used the one at the coffee shop next door or the internet cafe located a couple of blocks away.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Shanghai. Two thumbs up!"
57,2324,"Dec 2 2007 	Great hotel location not the best spa is basically a massage parlour	Chose the hotel because of its rating here and have to say that for the price it is a terrific deal. We upgraded to the Exec floor and were happy with the room although it was a bit smaller than expected for an Asian hotel room. It was clean, the bathroom was excellent - round bath, large separate shower room. Enjoyed the Exec lounge, quietbreakfast atmosphere, nice free evening drinks after hard day sightseeing and shopping, all dy coffee, tea, soft drinks, cakes etc.Location is a bit remote for the Bund side of the city but taxis are VERY cheap so you just hop in and they take you where you want to go.Traffic is a lot quieter here than in any other Asian metropolis I've visited so you don't spend most of your time in jams. Gym is well appointed for a hotel and is well maintained and kept clean and tidy.The only drawback is the Spa which is one reason to chose a hotel for us. This one is outsourced and so fails to meet the quality and standards of teh hotel itself. It is best summed up as a high class massage parlour, the masseurs seemed more interested in other &quot;massages&quot; than the one you asked for, aw a man anyway. The spa has no ambience - no music, no mood lighting, no quiet areas - its brightly lit everywhere, functional and a far cry from other spa's offered by such quality hotels. The Eton general mgr contacted me after my feedback to apologise and inform me that the spa has been warned, so maybe it will improve."
58,2324,"Dec 1 2007 	Pleasantly Surprised	I was skeptical of home grown hotels and usually stay in US chains when in China, but the Eton has given me an epiphany. Very friendly and attentive staff, great rooms with beautiful bathrooms and all very clean. They also had a great breakfast spread that would easily rival a Conrad or JW anywhere. I will not be staying in any other hotels in Shanghai now that I have been there."
59,2324,Nov 20 2007 	Excellent hotel	Very good hotel at a reasonable price. No wonder its 1st on Trip Advisor.
60,2324,"Nov 19 2007 	Excellent	This is a flash hotel at a reasonable price. Located opposite Pudong avenue metro station, the hotel was extremely comfortable, clean and looked very expensive. Marble bathroom, nice carpet &amp; excellent beds. We stayed on the 28th floor, view of Shanghai was superb.Hotel is very easy to get to, the staff are helpful and speak english. Not too far from most attractions - either by taxi or pay max 3 to 4 RMB on the metro.Booked via expedia, breakfast was not included, catch a metro to Bunt and have breakfast there."
61,2324,"Nov 4 2007 	Pleasantly surprised	We picked this hotel for our first night in China because we were looking for comfortable beds to get over our jet lag. We were shocked to find that the &quot;nice&quot; hotel we booked was instead a luxury hotel. The beds were soft and comfy. The bathroom was super nice with a separate shower/bath and the bathtub had its very own flatscreen. Beware that the bathroom is separated from the rest of the room by glass walls (with shades), but probably not for the shy or timid. The members of the staff were very helpful and didn't bat an eye when we rolled into the lobby with our giant backpacks. It was always easy to get a cab outside the front door, but the location was a bit off the beaten path. There is a metro stop right across the street, however. This was the highlight of our China hotels and I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
62,2324,"Oct 31 2007 	Simply the Best	Spent four nights in a premier room (like a suite) 27th Floor Grand Prix Period. Could not fault this Hotel absolutely first rate in everyway and so spotlessly clean. The Premier room was well worth the little extra cost, fantastic bathroom, windows on three sides of the room for fantastic views of Shanghai. Buffet Breakfast was excellent and beautifully presented. Taxis at the ready once you step outside the Hotel door, doorman will tell driver where you wish to go but be sure to have a Hotel Business card for your return journey as the taxi drivers do not speak english. The location of the Hotel was not a problem as Cabs are so cheap and plentiful.Just a couple of tips. Be extra cautious crossing the road (especially if you are from Australia/NZ as they drive on the other side of the road. Do have a foot massage only 50RMB for a full hour, a friend recommended us to a place opposite the Novotel Hotel just a short walk from the Eton Hotel. The staff where so friendly even though they had limited English. We ended up calling in every eveningafter a hectic day at the track. Anyone thinking of going to the Grand Prix next year just email me as I have plenty of information retransport etc."
63,2324,"Oct 29 2007	Excellent Service and Amenities	Stayed on an Executive floor at the Eton for three days in Ocober '07 and look forward to going back. The service at the hotel was excellent, the fitness facility was state of the art and the location, while not prime for sightseeing, made for an easy taxi ride into the heart of Shanghai. I recommend paying the small difference and staying on an Executive floor. The included breakfast, day time refreshments and evening wine/beer/cocktails more than make up for the difference in price. Overall, in terms of value, the Eton is hard to beat."
64,2324,"Oct 14 2007 	Amazing	I have to stay this is the best hotel Ive ever stayed in. Everything in this hotel is well thought out. Its spacious, modern, clean, and tidy; the staff are attentive and friendly.Our twin room was on the 27th floor of the hotel. Wed paid a little bit extra for the view  and what a great view we had of the Pudong Business District with the Jin Mao Tower clearly visible. We could see the top of Pearl Tower in the distance but the majority of the building was masked by some other buildings. Our room had two queen sized beds, flat screen TV, desk, two chairs, coffee table and ample storage space. The bathroom was amazing (see pictures) and also had a flat screen TV. The room had bathrobes, slippers and great selection of toiletries.The swimming pool was amazing too, again everything had been well thought out.Getting around Shanghai was quite easy. This hotel has an underground station next to it, although taxis are extremely cheap and are plentiful outside the hotel. BEWARE, the driving in China takes a little bit of getting used to. The Pearl Tower is within walking distance from the hotel, from here you can take the tourist tunnel to the Bund. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first night at the Singaporean BBQ. The food was tasty, fresh and very well presented. On our last night we enjoyed cocktails in the Lobby Lounge which featured a pianist. On both occasions we were well looked after and the prices were very reasonable. This hotel is brand new and it clearly shows, its very modern and suited our tastes, however, if you prefer something a little chintzier, it might not be your cup of tea.For a great meal head over to the Grand Hyatt hotel atop the Jin Mao tower, here you can enjoy a buffet with great views over the city. It was an excellent meal with a wide variety of both Chinese and western food at a very reasonable price."
65,2324,"Oct 12 2007 	Oasis in Shanghai	Highly recommend the Executive Rooms with breakfast, evening drinks and canapes. Shanghai is a busy, brilliant, chaotic city and the Eton Hotel was a convenient, relaxing base for our holiday. Clean, well designed, Metro subway right across the street, great staff, good food and refreshing swimming pool. The Executive room has a fantastic view across the city, and looks amazing daytime and dazzling at night  with the many architectural wonders lit up, including the Oriental Pearl Tower. The Eton is close to town, yet a little further way from the maddening crowds of central Shanghai."
66,2324,"Oct 10 2007 	Stunning design	My wife and I stayed in this hotel during the Special Olympics. We had a wonderful experience at the hotel, staff are courteous with excellent English skills and very helpful for advice on getting around the city and what to see.The building itself does what good design is supposed to do...lift your spirits."
67,2324,"Sep 24 2007 	Excellent service - value for money	We are a family of four staying in Eton Hotel for 3 nights in Sep. We chose to stay in Executive floor. With that extra bit of money, it is absolutely worth it. Breakfast is well prepared and adequate and drinks are available all day in the executive lounge.Staff are all polite and helpful. Rooms are spacious with separate shower and bath area.Although it is not in the central shopping area , taxi is very cheap and you can also try the MTR system. There is a MTR station right in front of the hotel. Overall , we are very happy about the hotel and it is value for money."
68,2324,"Sep 19 2007 	A top class hotel	Out of all the different hotels in Shanghai, I must say the Eton has the most helpful, friendly, courteous, professional and welcoming staff of the lot. Nothing is a problem no matter what time of day or night - there is always a friendly smile. I just returned from an extended stay in Shanghai. We chose the Eton Hotel based on online searches and the clincher was the high rating on Tripadvisor. We were NOT disappointed!A top class hotel with an excellent location. The hotel is located in the Pudong district of Shanghai - a vital location if you are in Shanghai on business. One of the best features is the metro station which is located right outside the hotel  this makes all of Shanghai easily accessible. We pulled up in the taxi and the doorman opened our door immediately and welcomed us warmly and took care of the luggage. We walked into the foyer and right away felt impressed - it looked great! The rooms are exactly as they appear on the website as are the common areas of the hotel. Unlike other hotels, their website is not edited to look better than the real thing. All of the materials in the room are of superior quality - from the high end bed linens and funky furniture to the eye pleasing wall artwork and the beautiful marble bathroom. There was a 32 in LCD in the bed room and a 17 LCD in the bathroom, both with international news and movie channels.Our room was very comfortable. The small features such as the turn down service and bottled water were a nice touch. The hotel also provides L'OCCITANE toiletries - shower gel, lotion, shampoo &amp; conditioner and they replenish them every day!The breakfasts were excellent. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family and would definitely return."
69,2324,"Sep 10 2007 	The Eton - A Mixed Bag	My wife and I have just returned from 3 nights at The Eton Shanghai. All in all the hotel is great value for money, but there are a few factors you should be aware of before booking.The hotel itself is very new and well appointed. I'd recommend upgrading to the &quot;executive floors&quot; which are probably the best value for money rooms I've stayed in, and certainly on par with the best &quot;modern&quot; sytle 5 star hotels that I've stayed in.There are only two downsides to The Eton. The first is the location. It is on the outer of the Pudong section. If you want to be in the thick of Shanghai, then stay on The Bund side of town. A trip across town by taxi to The Bund area, while very cheap (4-5 AUD) takes 25-30 mintues. If the nightlife of The Bund is what you are after, then The Eton isn't the best hotel choice. If you don't mind the travel, The Eton is fine (there is a metro station 20 metres out of the front door).Secondly, the service levels are fairly poor, and explain why The Eton is 4 star, not 5. The staff can't be faulted for effort, but generally their knoweldge of English is relatively poor for such a quality hotel. We experienced service challenges of one kind or the other with the front desk, room service, executive lounge, spa and front desk. The staff's politeness and helpfulness go a long way to rectifying these challenges, but overall the service is of a 3 star level at best (in fact it was signficantly worse that the 3 star hotel we stayed in while in Beijing).If you pack your patience, and don't mind a bit of extra travel, I'd recommend The Eton as a clean, modern and attractive hotel."

2,2329,"Jul 30 2009 	Pleasantly surprised.....	Getting to the hostel across Wuning road..... is an achievement in itself, but aside from that - it is a lovely hostel:)We are backpacking for 8 months and we had a twin room with ensuite, however the facilities were such that i could have easily used the dorms. The washroom facilities were excellent and cleaned everyday. Our ensuite was quite large and had a separate shower cubicle (a luxury!) and was extremely clean. The staff were helpful, if a little harrassed!! We stayed during the eclipse and it was very busy. Breakfast is ok, computers are good (but not free as advertised , ok only 1 Yuen per 15 mins but that isnt free!!). The food is good in the restaurant. Relatively close to the subway and easy to get around. Shanghai was disappointed but we werent by this hostel - would definietly recommend."
3,2329,"Feb 16 2009	Phone Stolen from locked private room in this hostel....awful experience!	On the surface this hostel is clean and seems well run but having had my mobile phone stolen out of my locked private room here, I would suggest to anyone considering this place to avoid it all costs! My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week as part of a 6 month round the world trip adn 4 weeks spent in China. This was the only place we experienced any robbery. After visiting nearly 40 hostels in 6 months that says something!When we told the hostel staff that my phone was missing and we wanted to report it to the police, they sent a member of the reception team to the police station with us and told us to lie.The guy from the hostel did all the talking to the police but refused to tell them my phone had been stolen in the hostel and made up a story that I had been mugged in the street. He then told me to sign a statement which he had made with the police officer and when I said I wanted him to sign it as well he became really aggressive and starting shouting at me. I was really frightened as was my boyfriend who has travelled the world with me twice and we have never experienced anything like that!I found the majority of staff to seem sweet and innocent before my phone was stolen but afterwards there was definitely an intimidating under current with them and they would hang around glaring at the foreigners in the reception area where there is the internet access and bar. It seemed like there might have been some sort of organised crime going on in there and everyone was in on it. Conveniently the security guard had a phone indentical to mine that he was fixated with and playing around with all day, the day after mine was stolen. V strange!"
4,2329,"Nov 13 2008 	Big bustling hostel	This hostel is not in the most picturesque part of Shanghai, and getting to it across the manic Wuning Rd is something of an achievement. The hostel itself is set back from the road in a sort of cul-de-sac, so is shielded from the worst of the noise from the road. It is a huge place. There are two residential blocks, a large reception/internet/seating area linking the two blocks and a large bar leading off that. As a single traveller in Shanghai for work, I thought it would be a good place to meet people. However, the socialising aspects were far outweighed by the inconvenience of the location and the general standard of the facilities. There are two showers and two toilets for each sex on each floor, and although I never had to queue, they did get pretty smelly and dirty. There are hot water rooms on every other floor, and one kitchen and two washing machines per block. This makes it really inconvenient if you want to make yourself a cup of coffee or heat up some noodles. The bar does food, and it is reasonably priced and tasty- but make sure they put your order into their computer or prepare for an unpleasant stand-off with the staff when your dinner doesn't come. There is also a buffet breakfast included in the room price, but it is not great- cereal, (cold) steamed buns and red bean porridge. The internet is intolerably slow and with only seven terminals between 500 travellers be prepared for a long wait. Finally, this is not a hostel for anyone who needs a good nights' rest. The long, institutional corridors magnify every sound- particularly people who have locked themselves out of their rooms in the early hours.Having said all that, if you're after a big, fun, cheap hostel where you can drink cheap beers with fellow travellers over a game of pool or FIFA on the PS2 during your week in Shanghai, then this might be just the place for you."
5,2329,"Oct 20 2008 	Impressed!	We're three girls mid 20's sharing a triple private ensuite in this hostel and in the week and a half we have been here we have been very impressed. Contrary to the name, the hostel is definitely not city centre, however having read other reviews on this website we knew that before we came and realised being central would be way over our budget. It's really easy to pick up a taxi outside the hostel and takes about 15 minutes to get to People's Square, costing less than 3.00. Our room is pretty large and gets cleaned every day, we're getting towels replaced and some free items such as toothbrushes and shampoo have been provided. The staff seem really nice. There's air conditioning in the room which appears to be free of charge and the internet (via lan cable) is slow, especially at peak times, but it works. The shower is hot and a good pressure. We went to the restaurant one night. We were not expecting it to be great but we really enjoyed it. We were after a western fix and the pasta and pizza were very tasty and tasted really fresh. We had some noisy neighbours a couple of nights which was annoying but part and parcel of staying in a hostel so we didn't complain and they didn't stay long. Some of the reviews mentioned the beds being hard, and they are firm but we haven't had any problems sleeping in that respect. It's definitely worth taking the hostel card out which has the address in Chinese as well as a small map on the back, as hardly any taxi drivers speak or read English, and if you come from the airport in a taxi make sure you have the address printed as it's down a side street which would be pretty difficult to find first time.The hostel is very close to a subway station also.If I return to Shanghai I'd definitely stay here again."
6,2329,"Sep 26 2008 	Just great	After having travelled for a month around the northeast of China and having visited 6 cities and 6 different hostels, I can say this is the best of all!! Clean, modern, new, the staff are nice and speak english, they offer a free breakfast (very good by the way!!), free internet that works and enough PC's!!! And a free shuttel bus to the city center (the subway station is not far either). The lounge and bar area are also great. This is the place to stay in Shanghai!!"
7,2329,"Sep 14 2008 	Great hostel in Shanghai	I stayed at this youth hostel for a week. The hostel itself is large and many of the facilities are more hotel-like, especially the single and double rooms, which I both tried (see below). The hostel facilities are good. There is free internet, free in-room (slow) wifi, TVs in all rooms, and air conditioning in the rooms. The bar/restaurant area is pleasant and a good place to meet people in the evenings. There are laundry facilities and the hostel staff can help with booking train tickets, airport rides and other transport.At first I was in a standard single room on the ground floor. The room was ok, with a single bed and free wifi, a toilet and shower, and a kettle with green tea sachets. However, the bed was super-hard, and space was kinda limited. There are only two small lights in the room, which made it dark  and the desk lamp kept spluttering so I tried not to touch it. Add to that the fact that the windows gave out onto the front entrance, which also made it noisy when people congregate outside for a smoke or a chat. Lastly, the air conditioning unit in all rooms has controls in Chinese  and the handset in the room stopped working after a short while, which only gave me the choice of having the unit off, or on full blast. My stay in a single room was short, however, as one dark morning a storm moved in over Shanghai, and a very big leak opened in the ceiling of the room, flooding the floor. The staff was very quick and efficient in moving me to a double room.Double rooms are similar to single rooms, but overall more pleasant  more space, the air con unit was newer, the beds were thankfully softer. You also get better quality shampoo, I noticed....although Id recommend to buy shampoo in the supermarket. Getting to the hostel is easy as long as you have taxi directions in Chinese, and remember that the road is not Wuning Nan Road, but Wuning Road proper. You can also get there by metro (Caoyang St. stop), but I can see how that could be a bit confusing, as the metro station has 3 different exits. The rule of thumb is, exit the metro, turn right and follow the tracks a short distance towards an intersection of two big roads, one of which is Wunin. Cross the road (taking good care), and the hostel is a short ways through a gated entrance to your right.Around the hostel, you can find some cheap places to eat. If you walk out onto Wuning Rd and turn right, you can find a meal for 10 yuan. There is also a small shop just outside the hotel, but the owners livelihood seems to depend on fleecing non-Chinese tourists....a bottle of Nongfu Spring water there cost me 5 yuan (more than I would pay for a bottle of water in Europe!), but at any Family Mart in Shanghai the standard price is 1.7 yuan.The reception staff speaks English and is very pleasant and willing to help. The bar staff was a bit stand-offish when I was there, at one point shouting at me because I asked the same question twice (I did not understand the answer the first time....I was trying my best, but Ive only taken a few months of Mandarin!).The only negatives about this hostel were the inconsistent room service - items were not necessarily replaced very often, such as shampoo or tea. Also, the wireless stopped working for a few days and none of the staff seemed to know why, or when it would be fixed - this left a lot of travellers having to line up for the free computers. Tip: the bar has ethernet points, and the front desk is more than happy to lend you ethernet cables if you need them. So if you have your own laptop, ethernet in the bar is a lot faster than wifi in your room."
8,2329,"Mar 28 2008 	Great place not 5 star but incredible for the price	When in China, do as the Romans do....This fantastic hostel has accomodations for sharing and private rooms, all incredibly cheap. I stayed in a private room for a month while taking a course and can not begin to expound on the wonderful staff, management and facilities. My only gripe was the really bad tp. You can buy your own cheap at the Carrefour down the street. One plus is a really amazing street market, behind the hostel. I bought eggs (by the ones) and fruit daily. mandarin oranges and the best apples. Cooked the eggs (hard boiled) in the electric teapot provided in the room.There is a house dog named Chris that loves or hates you. It became my mission to have him love me...he did, finally."
