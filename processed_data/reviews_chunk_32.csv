179,678,"Oct 7 2006 	Good location at a fair price	Stayed in a standard double with my husband. Booked thru a name your price option but only received less than $20 off per night from the regular internet price. Stayed 4 nights 3rd week of September 2006.Pros: Very nice &amp; clean, HUGE bathroom with decent water pressure. Bathroom was almost as large as the sleeping area and appeared to be updated recently. Had a working heated towel rack, which was a nice luxury. Had all necessary items in room: safe, refrigerated mini-bar, ironing board, hairdryer &amp; trouser press. A/C worked well in unseasonably warm late summer. 24-hour business center made it easy to keep in touch back home. Staff friendly &amp; efficient. Charming location: clean, relatively quiet &amp; felt safe walking in this area at night. Within a couple of blocks of the St. James underground terminal. Several pubs &amp; restaurants nearby. However, since this is basically a business area, most places close early with some closing as early as 5:30pm on weekend nights. Buffet breakfast was a little spendy, but worth it if you require a big, quality meal in the morning. There are cheaper breakfast options nearby, but I found that with the cheaper options, the quality in the meats (bacon &amp; sausage for full English breakfast) didnt seem to taste as good  too salty. Also, if you were to add fruits, juices and other pastries to the breakfast, it would come out to be about the same. Good martinis in lounge and excellent to sip in courtyard when weather permits.Cons: Bed was not as comfortable as Im used to, but I seemed to sleep fine regardless. Extremely grimy &amp; sooty lampshades, which seemed odd because everything else was pretty clean. Usually, Im not one to notice something so minor as lampshades, but the condition of them were really quite horrendous. Since I did not stay in another hotel in the area during my stay, I cant really comment on the value, but it seemed fair enough especially given the location. The rooms seriously need updating and if done so even just a little, this would be an excellent choice. Would consider staying here again or at least recommend."
180,678,"Oct 7 2006	Disappointing.......	First impressions of this hotel are good, it has an impressive look from the outside as does the lobby. Check in was quick and polite but not particularly friendly, as we found with most the staff we encountered, although a couple were. The corridors however are in desperate need of a refurb lending a somewhat shabby appearance! The room itself was OK, the bed small, no way a queen size as was stated, more like a standard 4'6&quot; and really not what you would expect from a Crown Plaza. Also slightly surprised by the use of sheets and blankets - I thought hotels had moved on to duvets! The bathroom was nice though and the shower great. One word about room service - WAY OVERPRICED! Eat out instead - theres loads of choice in London! Would choose Kensington Forum next time - more convenient and modern!"
181,678,"Oct 4 2006 	Not as good as you might think...	I stayed here on a Friday and Saturday night in late September 2006 on business.Would I stay here again? Er, no.Why not? Well, at 179/night I thought that the carpets in the hallway really shouldn't be as tatty as they were (the foyer of course is spotless), that the elevators should actually work to save me lugging baggage and laptop up three flights of stairs, and that it ought to have some decent sound insulation between walls/windows, given that it's a 4 start hotel (allegedly). It does not.The man in the next room to me coughed, and I actually thought there was someone in the same room (I was in Room 315 in case you're interested). Noise travels down the hallways like you wouldn't believe, and if you're unfortunate enough (like me) to be situated on the front wall of the hotel facing the street, then you better pack earplugs if you plan on actually getting any sleep, because when the garbage men come round at whatever unearthly hour they did (on both nights that I stayed), you will get woken up when them empty 10,000 bottles (or what sounds like it) out of wherever it is they are emptying. A TraveLodge has better sound insulation.Oh, and my (male) business colleague and I shared a room - a delight (not). It was a twin, but the beds were close enough so that if he mistook me for his wife in the night, we'd have been in a lot of trouble."
182,678,Sep 28 2006 	Loved It. Would stay there again. Great location very clean nice staff.	We stayed from 9/21 to 9/26 and enjoyed everyday. The staff was excellent and so helpful. The rooms were some of the cleanest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. The location is wonderful. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this a 9. Next time we come to London we will stay here again and upgrade to a suite. Do not hesitate to stay at the Crowne Plaza you will not be disappointed.
183,678,"Aug 8 2006 	We Thought It Was Great	We had two rooms. Room 166 for my 13 yr old daughter and friend was a fabulous large room. Double bed, large bath, overlooked courtyard, clean and well decorated. My husband and I stayed in room 157, a bit smaller, double bed, overlooking courtyard, clean and with all amenities. We received good service from all employees, had tea out in the well maintained courtyard with great service. The hotel is in walking distance from Buckingham Palace and Westminster. We arrived at 10:00 and could not check in, but by 3:00 when we arrived back at the hotel after sight seeing, our bags were in the rooms. When we returned in the evening the girls room had been &quot;refreshed&quot; and the beds turned down. But for some reason our room did not get the same service. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel due to cost, but we found many coffee shops in the vicinity on our way to sights. I will definitely stay here again if I can get room 166. Only complaint...2 employee told us the cab ride to Gatwick was 30-45 minutes. It took one hour and 15 minutes so .....there was much nail biting the last 30 minutes of our trip."
184,678,"Jul 29 2006	What a Disappointment	Through priceline I booked Crowne Plaza London Saint James and though I was given a great deal--about half off the nearly $400/night room rate for this 4 star hotel. Once we were shown to our room, though, we were quite disappointed. Our room was a TINY corner room with a window that for the most part directly faced a brick wall. The bed was tiny--maybe a double bed but definately not a queen. The bathroom was nicely appointed (which was the only 4star aspect of this depressing little room). It is amazing that a place can get a 4 star rating when some of the rooms can be so much less than 4-star! We were in Paris just before London and stayed at this amazing 3 star hotel--so it was quite a contrast! If I had paid full price for this room, I would have been absolutely sick.Since we were only in London overnight, we wanted to make the most of our time by heading out as soon as we had checked in. We were told that our bags would be brought right up to our room so we waited and waited and waited. Finally we called to investigate where our bags were. They were finally delivered but we had to wait quite some time. Very frustrating.On the plus side, the hotel was in close proximity to the Victoria train station so we could quickly get there to catch the express to Gatwick. It was also within quick distance to the Eurostar."
185,678,"Jul 27 2006 	Great location but overpriced	I have stayed at this hotel several times, mainly because of its excellent location. Check in staff helpful, but a little stand offish. Standard room, but adequate. Nice and clean, and did not witness any of the &quot;dust&quot; described by other customers.Breakfast overpriced, would recommend using the little Italian cafe just outside the hotel. Great prices and quality and a -- sight cheaper than the hotel. (Turn left outside the hotel, about 50 metres down the road on the right had side).Overall, great location, but extremely expensive for what you get."
186,678,"Jul 20 2006 	Terrible place	We stayed in the room 422 for two days going from Europe back to USA. Try to avoid this room. It overlooks air conditioning duct, it is small and with the strong smell of mildew. Pity, I did not take the pictures, but I guess other will include them soon.When we complained about the smell they told us that they will come to refresh the room (which meant they sprayed it, but it did not change anything). Carpets in the halls were dirty and dusty, elevators very old. The only advantage: good location and decent breakfast. We had breakfast included in price - but if not it costs $36 per person. I wanted to access internet and had to pay $14 for 15 min. They sell the cards and it is not possible to use internet for 5 minutes.Summary: overpriced hotel in need of renovation or at least cleaning. Staff not very helpful. By the way, we were offered newspapers (usually complimentary), but then they included it on the bill. The first day we got it delivered, the second day they forgot it. Also they forgot to change towels in the bathroom. Fortunately, we stayed there only two days."
187,678,Jul 13 2006	FREEKIN DUST BOWL!!! DUMPY [---] PIECE...HORRIBLE!	If you are a fan of DUST then this is your Hotel.I think the Hotel was built around the 1700's and I think the dust has stayed there since then.I could barely breathe and the carpet was a wreck. 4 stars...ha ya right!It was a disaster. The lobby looks all amazing so you are thinking to yourself this place is gonna be awsome! NO!!! It is such a [---] hole. The elevator must have been the first one ever made. Its like a death trap and I was on the very top floor and I think Henry the VIII was my roommate. Such a dusty dump. If you are best friends with dust then this is your place. Have they never heard of a vacum...Does Mr. Hoover not sell in those parts? Would buying and replacing the carpet be so bad?The furniture has dents and scrapes in it from I am guessing the time Keith Richards stayed there in the 70's and the carpet had stains..stains galore.Please dont stay here...for the love of GOD!Two fingers up
188,678,"Jul 9 2006	Enjoyed very much!	We stayed here for 2 nights after a Med cruise out of Rome. Having operated on Euros for two weeks we were fairly enured to the dollar exchange rate, but... this hotel really had us going into laughter with room service rates ... $32 for a hamburger! An excellent place to eat was at the end of Buckingham Gate from the palace ... The Albert. We absolutely loved it. The hotel was extremely quiet due to the extremely heavy door to our room. Location was great and would definitely stay here again."
189,678,"Jun 8 2006	Second visit disappointing	I stayed at this Hotel at the end of December and had a lovely room and a very nice experience.I liked the location, room was very nice close to the underground and nice neighborhood. It was down the street from Buckingham Palace, yet it was on a quiet street.When I decided I would start my 2 week vacation in late May in London I booked 3 nights at the hotel in February.I am also a priority club member which entitles me to an upgrade if available.Our room was not ready so they brought us coffee, nice start except that when we inquired after an hour if it was ready we were told it was not. Later found out it was the person never bothered to check.I was told this was the only room I could get since I wanted non smoking. The entire floor is non smoking and this was the only room.... It was tiny long and narrow ...the view was a wall. The TV was so old and small and far away from the bed you could barely hear it at normal volume.The Concierge was rarely able to answer any questions.On the plus side we ate dinner at the restaurant our last night and the food was excellent as was the service ...nice atmosphere and quite busy."
190,678,"Jun 1 2006	A Week on Holiday	My wife and I just returned from a great week in London. We loved the Crowne Plaza Hotel London - St. James. The room was a good size and well decorated. Yes, some parts of the hotel are showing some wear, but you have to look past that fo find the real beauty of this hotel. I really call this hotel A-MAZE-ING as I felt like I was working my way through a maze as we found our way to our room, but then, that's part of this hotel's charm. First I list THE POSITIVES--LOCATION, LOCATION LOCATION! So close to Buckingham Pallace, the Palace Museum and the Royal Mews. Within walking distance of Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Big Ben, the London Eye, St. James Park, Trafalger Square and Piccadilly Circus. Just a few minutes from the St. James Park Tube Station, which gives you access to the whole of London. Then the staff is VERY friendly and helpful.Next I list THE NEGATIVES, which are few. The cost of eating in the hotel can put some real stress on your budget, and STAY away from the MINI BAR. 2.95 for a mini can of Pringles is outrageous as is for a full English breakfast. I suggest you go up to the corner of Petty France and BuckinghamGate to Bon Gustos Italian Resaurant. It's open for breakfast (an English breakfast for 3.95) and lunch only. For diggner try soem of the many local pubs. The Buckingham Arms or the Adam and Eve, both on Petty France. They both have GOOD food at reasonable prices. Another interesting pub is St Stephens Tavern just across the street from Big Ben where you can take your dring, go up stairs and think of the &quot;ghosts&quot; of members of Parliament who may have sat in that very spot plotting their plots.All in all,When we return to London we will certainly try to stay at the Crowne Plaza, St. James."
191,678,"May 21 2006	Loved the Crowne Plaza	My wife and I recently celebrated our 36th wedding anniversary at the Crowne Plaza Saint James in London. The location of this hotel is excellent (very close to major tourist attractions such as Buckinham Palace, Royal Mews, etc.), and it is situated very close to easy-to-access public transportation, i.e. bus and subway (tube). Our room was clean, spacious, and very comfortable. Throughout our stay, the hotel staff was very efficient and accommodating. The hotel is located in the heart of the government district of London, which meant that it became very quiet in the evenings and on weekends. Those searching for more &quot;night life&quot; would have to venture into the West End section, which is about a 15 minute walk.We booked this trip through American Airlines Vacations, which included a choice of hotels, as well as a variety of tours and amenitites. I tarvel often internationally on business, and I was very pleased with the choice of the Crowne Plaza. The room came with a full English breakfast each day, and we would highly recommend it. Although we did not eat any other meals in the hotel, there were several higher-end restaurants either in the hotel, or within easy walking distance. There are also several pubs within walking distance which served hearty &quot;pub grub&quot; at reasonable prices. All in all, a superb vacation at an excellent hotel."
192,678,"May 16 2006	Very nice hotel	Agree with the positive reviews here. My wife and I had a wonderful 4 night stay. They even allowed us to check in early (very early). Our room was 2nd floor on the back side of the hotel facing the schoolyard, which though at times was a little loud in the morning, it was also a quaint addition to a unique London experience. Room was clean, up-to-date, and roomy enough. We also liked the fact that the hotel was on a relatively quiet street and not situated next to countless other hotels. Yet, still just steps away from pubs, sights, etc."
193,678,"May 14 2006	A nice hotel	We recently stayed here for one night whilst seeing a show in the West End (15 minute walk). It is in a good location with a good chunk of your tourist spots in the very near vicinity - either by walking or through the nearby tube stations. I found all the staff i dealt with to be very proficient and helpful. Although the doorman seemed a little over keen to have my car key to valet park whilst i was trying to check in, (keener to get a tip i suspect) which was a little irratating. However, he was honest enough to find me a free parking space right outside the hotel (sat &amp; sun only), other wise the daily charge is 25 per day.The room we had was on the second floor, it was nice, clean and suited us just fine. It was bigger than some London hotel rooms i have been to before. Our view was of an office block, could have waved at the workers had it been midweek! We did notice occasional noise from the tube but it was otherwise very quite. The communal areas of the hotel were spotless and what i have come to expect from Crowne Plaza hotels.We didn't eat at the hotel, but the menus did look good. Although i would say the breakfast cost of 22 for a full english was ridiculously expensive. if you are not from the UK - this is extortionate!. Plenty of places nearby in Victoria where you can get brekkie for way less than 10.I have to pass comment like most others - THE MINI-BAR. I chuckle as i write this, that some one at the hotel could actually bring themselves to arrive at the prices they charged. (i did not use it). My favourites are the 1.50 for a packet of polo mints - 30 pence in the newsagents, 9.50 for a mini A-Z london map when written on the back is the shop price of 4.95!! All in all, a good value 4* hotel in a good location, just avoid the in-house charges"
194,678,"Apr 25 2006	Four fun days!!	Stayed here in January. This is a very nice hotel close to everything to see in London. It is about 4-5 blocks to Westminster Abby/Thames River &amp; only about 2 long blocks to Buckingham Palace. Walk across Princess Diana Park and you're in Piccadilly Circus. I recommend eating at a little cafe called Cafe Concerto(Piccadilly Circus). Not too expensive.The cheescake was excellent. We also ate at Aberdeen Steak House(Piccadilly)Semi-expensive about $60 U.S. similar to Black Angus.While staying at this hotel, walk 1/2 block down the street to Bon Gusto(blue awning?). The concierge all know it and eat there. Very reasonable compared to the hotel restaurant which is pricey. Be prepared, the bacon is a thick slice of ham and the beans are baked beans. As for the hotel: it's huge!We had a long walk through hallways to get to our room. Very spacious although bed was low to the ground and two beds made into one. There was a school outside the window and the boys were pretty loud first thing in the a.m. The view from our room was not good. Only other city buildings and the brick wall of the next hotel.The bathroom had heated towel racks, never saw one before, worked nicley too. Plush bath robes.The concierge service was top notch,honest, and helpful 24/7. If you're going to Harrod's remember it closes early off season. You'll need 3-4 hrs to see most of it. Big as a city block. Don't walk to Tower/London Bridge from here!! Take the tube."
195,678,"Apr 19 2006	Easter in London	If you read the past 50 reviews of this hotel, they are all over the board. We ended up choosing this hotel after narrowing it down to a few select ones and then checking our Eyewitness/DK London travel book which highlights a few good hotels in each location (as we do with all our vacations..that series of books has never steered us wrong). This one was listed for the Westminster area and being a member of the Hol. Inn Priority Club, we decided to go with it. Mainly I think the difference between the previous good and bad reviews is where your room is located and which set of staff members you had! Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking the courtyard and was a standard room. I would say it was an average European sized room with a smallish but very clean and well kept bathroom. Water flow was great as were towels (just the right size and thickness). My first thought was that the bed was low to the ground but it was surprisingly comfortable as were the pillows-and I'm pretty hard to please...but of course, to each his own. Mini bar prices were freaking outrageous...more outrageous than usual minibar charges, but either youre an eat-from-the-mini-bar-person or youre not, so whatever. The room and halls were very quiet and thats coming from a person with near-bionic ears. The location from St James' tube stop was about 3 mins but Victoria was much further. Buckingham Palace is just down the street as is St James' park.... Westminster/Big Ben/London Eye are all within a 10-15 minutes EASY walk. I found the location great. Afterall, one hotel can't be near everything....The staff was hit or miss depending on what shift it was....same with concierge...either very helpful or very snooty. Something to improve upon would be attention to detail...they forgot at least one item on our room service tray every day and had to go back and retrieve it, but did so very kindly. Afternoon tea in the lobby was missing the sandwiches and we had to ask for them...minor things like that. We ate at 2 of the restaurants and were very pleased with taste/service/value. We did use the spa for one service and although the massage was excellent, it seemed no one staffed the front desk or knew how to do &quot;intake&quot; of their appointments. Like I said, very minor things. One thing that I considered minor but really could have been a problem if I were here for business is that they failed to give me a wakeup call on one day. The wake-up call button on the phone did not work so I had to call down to the front desk on most days to personally ask for a call. The other thing that bugged me was that the room service people were knocking on your door after an hour trying to pick up your tray...for one, there is a note on the tray stating the ext. you should call when you wish your tray to be picked up. And also, they ask before they leave the room what time they should come back for the tray and I always said at least 2 hours...Overall, we tend to stay at 4 star properties. While this is not the Ritz, its nothing to sneeze at and was actually a very good value. I would stay here again."
196,678,"Apr 6 2006	Girlie weekend!	Hotel was fab, staff were friendly, food was good (but a bit pricey) room was huge! Had a great weekend! Used the jacuzzi/spa which was very relaxing, too! Highly recommended, especially for the price."
197,678,"Mar 27 2006	a nozzle for the hoover	We had looked for a quality hotel near to victoria station and handy for the Vauxhall area of London. Having stayed many times at the Holiday Inn chain we thought we would give ourselves a treat by staying at their sister hotel chain Inter-Continental Group. We had read with enthusiasim Trip Advisor's readers' reviews and took note to ask for a room overlooking the courtyard. We had booked well in advance and specifically asked for the courtyard room and paid for a deluxe room with king size bed. The receptionist although courteous spoken broken English but this is to be expected within the capital. We duly showed her our printed confirmation receipt detailing exactly our requirements. Unfortunately the courtyard room was not available only a smoking room. We could try Saturday and we could move. We proceeded to our room then the shock - the room was dreadful, small dismal overlooking a playground and what appeared to be a bottling plant or brewery as there were crates upon crates of empty bottles. The room was number 169 which definitely did not have a king size bed or neither was this a deluxe room. We immediately asked for a transfer. We were assured this would be a lovely room. Mmmmmm on the 4th floor room 424 yes king size bed, lovely room? I think not. Overlooking an enormous air conditioning duct with rooms also overlooking into each other. The toilet seat was broken, the roller blinds (I believe may have been once white) were now consumed by dust the carpets certainly had seen better days, and why oh why dont cleaners use the nozzle belonging to their vacuum cleaner and get all the dust and muck from between skirting boards and the carpet edge. The complimentary bottle of water was numbered 1 and no more. Unlike the holiday inns where these are replaced daily. The tea and coffee were placed in a butter dish minus the biscuits - none were ever given. Word of warning stay away from the mini bar 5 for a Toblerone bar of chocolate. 3.50 for a 69p packet of pringles. Why dont these hotels charge sensible prices and then they may sell some of these goods. I pity help the foreign traveller who may not be able to convert our money.Saturday morning we decided to take advantage of the 'well equiped gym'. The equipment was sadly in need of replacing or a good overhaul. Whilst there the fire alarm went into continuous mode no-one came to see if we were safe, the reception for the gym being up a flight of stairs. After several minutes of this alarm ringing I went to investigate. Not a sound of this alarm could be heard by the reception. 'Oh is it going off again was the response' However the instructor did proceed with me to investigate however once half way back to the gym the arlarm stopped. Heaven help people if it was a really fire you certainly would be on your own.We are regular visitors to London 6-8 times a year to visit family. We will not be doing a repeat visit to this hotel.It may have been a rather swish hotel in its heyday but sadly it is just an overpriced dismisal hotel in need of a really good housekeeper to clean it."
198,678,Mar 20 2006	Superb Weekend	Reading past reviews last year I think the Plaza have improved things. The staff were always attentive and the service was superb. Our room was upgraded to a superb suite overlooking the fountain and Bank restaurant. We could not fault anything. Two small technical issues was a TV (we had 2!) with a dodgy screen and one set of curtains were slightly difficult to close. But everything else was 100%. I hope everyone has the experience we had at St.James.
199,678,"Mar 9 2006	A Perfect Pick with Priceline Price	Kudos to the Crowne Plaza St. James for location and spacious rooms. We placed a bid of $120 USD on Priceline, which was accepted at this hotel. The hotel is a 3 minute walk from St. James Park Tube stop and within 5 minutes of Buckingham Palace, St. James Park, Westminster Abbey, and Big Ben. This area is dead on the weekends, but is a bit busier during the work week. The hotel lobby is impressive and the staff was attentive. Rooms, although dated, were spacious and had all amenities any traveler could need. For European hotels, the bathroom was quite large and bath robes and towel warmers were even provided. There is an adequate gym located in the basement of the hotel, which is available to guests free of charge. For a fee, Spa services are also available. Our only complaint about the services of the hotel was a rather inept concierge. He informed us he knew nothing about the Tube because he &quot;never rode it&quot; and was terrible with providing directions. As others have noted, ask for a courtyard view. You will have a rather dismal view of air conditioning units and brick walls if you don't have the court yard view. In short, for travelers with reasonable expectations from a four star hotel, the Crowne Plaze St. James will not disappoint. We would definitely stay there again!"
200,678,"Feb 28 2006	Great location and Clean	We stayed here for 3 nights in Feb. The hotel is very centrally located. It is less than a five minute walk to Buckingham Palace and a little more than five minutes to Big Ben. The hotel was very clean and the staff seemed friendly. The free water, tea, coffee, and candy was a nice touch. The only complaint I have about the hotel was it was freezing in our room. I'm sure the issue is the result of the age and structure of the hotel. The hotel directions indicate that you should take the Underground to the St. James stop from Victoria Station. If you are willing to walk about 5 minutes you can save the 3 pounds on the subway!"
201,678,"Feb 7 2006	Convenient location pleasant hotel	We stayed here during a brief visit to London in January, 2006. The location was terrific; we were within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Parliament, and the Thames and the London Eye. Both the Victoria and Green Park Tube stations are about a 10-minute walk from the hotel. The area is safe and quiet but lacks the abundance of restaurants and shops that are available in other areas. The lobby, as noted in other reviews, is quite nice. We found our room to be comfortable and sufficient for our needs, with a fairly roomy bathroom, by European hotel standards. Everything was clean and in good repair. The hotel employees generally responded to our requests quickly. While we found the hotel to be quiet, some noise from the hallways is audible in the rooms, so light sleepers might want to bring a set of earplugs. If possible, request a room overlooking the courtyard; these rooms have a lovely view, while others have more dismal views of building walls and rooftop equipment. Overall, we would certainly consider returning to this hotel on future trips to London."
202,678,"Dec 21 2005	Exceptional Service Fantastic Accommodation and Great Location	We have just returned from a weekend stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Buckingham Gate, 16th - 18th December. On booking I emailed the hotel to request an upgraded room as the stay was for a special occasion. On checking in I was told that we had indeed been upgraded to an executive room which would be free of charge, great start!! The room was spacious and airy with a separate sitting area and great views. One slight concern was the heating which did not seem capable of heating the room. We went out for a meal in the evening and returned to the room which was now even colder!! On contacting the reception we were told if we could re-pack we could be moved and further upgraded for our inconvenience. This time the small inconvenience of re-packing was rewarded by an apartment style suite with separate entrance, hallway, living room and enormous bedroom with a walk-in-wardrobe bigger than some hotel rooms I have stayed in!! During all of this the staff were fantastic, professional, friendly and always polite. With all of this added to a fabulous hotel, we had a marvellous stay and would recommend this hotel not only for its location (1 street away from Buckingham Palace and 2 minute walk from the Tube) but quality and truly great staff."
203,678,"Dec 21 2005	fantastic experience	We stayed at this hotel in Dec 2005, from the time wearrived in the taxi, to leaving in the taxi was amazing. We were met by the concierge who was very friendly who passed our luggage over to a young gentleman to take upto our rooms ,he also was very pleasant, we then booked in with the reception who werevery lovely, we enquired about an upgrade which they did kindly for us. when we reached our room it was beautiful looking over the courtyard at the back of the hotel, the bed was huge and very comfortable, the room had everything in it that we could ever want.I would say not to touch any of the goodies they have in the room, for instance a box of the ordinary size pringles were somthing like 6.50 which is pretty ridiculous, no fool would ever pay that kind of money!!! apart from that I must say we have been to london a few times and this hotel is the best yet.The beds were beautifully clean and fresh linen was put on daily, lovely!The food in the resturant was out of this world, every morning the breakfasts were laid out lovely, with so much choice, definitely worth every penny.The hotel is situated in a very convenient area, we found we could walk everywhere to the big named shops etc.I think this hotel is great!I read reviews on the trip advisor and was alittle put off, but I think you need to check it out for yourselves.BRILLIANT!!!!!"
204,678,"Nov 17 2005	ok	Stayed in this hotel for one night during a weekend break to London for my husband's fortieth birthday. Room only.Booked it via Priceline auction site, so put in a bid to spend no more than 80 at a 4 star in Westminster and this is the hotel that accepted our bid.Check in staff were very helpful and efficient.Room was ok if a little dated, bathroom could definatley do with re-grouting.Got awoken by the maid at 9am on the Sunday morning who came into our room (after knocking) but quickly apologised and left.I suppose we should have put our DND sign out the night before although on check-out day I have never been bothered by an eager maid before, I suppose she may have had the wrong room number and I didn't complain, but I was a little hacked off, my only lie in of the week after a very late night.Had a great weekend though and we didn't use any of the hotel facilities as we were out and about so much. The location was great for this trip as we wanted to stay by the palace."
205,678,"Nov 8 2005 	Bland Unremarkable	The Crowne Plaza St. James is a serviceable chain hotel. The lobby is rather grand, but my room was small and unremarkable. (Unremarkable except for one fact...I never knew there were so many shades of beige!) During my stay, one of the two lobby elevators was slated for repair, which made for a long wait. My window faced a British schoolyard, so--despite jet-lag--I was awakened early each morning by the sound of children at recess. Service at the breakfast buffet was lackluster at best; I had to refill my own coffee cup three times, and my presence went largely unnoticed by the wait staff. This particular hotel seems to be extremely popular with large bus tours; the lobby was always full of giant tourist groups, and seas of luggage. If you're used to standard issue chain hotels, this one's probably fine. But if you long for something more unique, truer to the local culture, and with a heightened sense of service, luxury and hospitality, then you'll be disgruntled. (And despite the ostensible lure of the location--a mere block from Buckingham Palace--the surrounding neighborhood is actually somewhat inconvenient, and a bit of a bore.)"
206,678,"Oct 28 2005	Good hotel bad mangers	I stayed in the hotel ealier this month, being a priority club ambassador member, I get upgrade to a better room at Intercontinental and sometimes at crown plaza, stayed there last Dec and was upgraded to a suite. this time I checked with them the night before arriving and I was told that they book me an upgrade, but to my surprise they changed their mind. to make things worse, I found in the bathroom the cleaner cloths on the towels with a dirty tissue hanging of it. I took it down to the manager at reception, he just asked is the room clean, and that was it. I had to ask later for the towels to be changed. other than that, the location is great, few min from buckingham palace, few min from Tube station, and less than 10 min walk from victoria and westminster. rooms are ok in size but little old,need to be renewed. the bar at the hotel is great esp week-end.so if you want bed and breakfast for an expensive price, go to this hotel otherwise try somewhere else, as this one by no means high class service"
207,678,"Oct 27 2005	Great Location.	Stayed here 5 nights. The Crowne Plaza has a great location. It's 1 1/2 blocks from Buckingham Palace &amp; St. James tube station and approx 4 blocks to Parliament. The hotel was as you would expect for a Crowne Plaza with good size rooms and a nice bathroom. We had a small balcony that looked out onto the interior courtyard and the room was nice and quiet. There were 2 things that were not great about this hotel: 1. It was in a business district, so not too many restaurants or night life near by, but you can always take a bus or taxi to find something.2. The conceierge was not very helpful when asking questions about recommendations on how to get to places or where to eat nearby. These were very minor things as we were out most of the time seeing the sights. Overall it was a good hotel."
208,678,"Oct 26 2005	Disappointing for Crowne Plaza	My husband &amp; I stayed here on points for 2 nights to attend a wedding. Honestly the staff was very nice &amp; accomodating. We were shown to our room several hours before check-in as requested &amp; upgraded. Although everything was comfortable &amp; clean, I would have been very disappointed had we been paying for what we got. The floors &amp; guestrooms are in serious need of renovation. There are many features that were clearly trendy in the 1970's that have not been changed since. The drapes &amp; carpeting needed a good cleaning or to be replaced. The bathroom's vanity was made of a terracotta-colored molded plastic &amp; the shower/tub combo had a very low ceiling in comparision to the rest of the bathroom.The staff was great, the valet manager let us park our rental car on the street with the other valet cars for no charge &amp; whenever we needed something, there was no hesitation on the front desk's part. But as far as luxurious furnishings, it needs to come into the 21st Century.N.B. There was a small fire the morning that we left &amp; everyone was directed down the street. Although we never really found out what happened, we were allowed back into the hotel very quickly &amp; the bar area was wet &amp; smelled like smoke."
209,678,"Oct 23 2005	First Class Hotel? - No way!	My husband and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza in September for 6 nights. We paid for a superior room and were pleased with the size and furnishings. The temperature in the room was over 80 degrees [I know, unheard of in London] and although there was air conditioning, it did not work. We reported this and several different people came to the room apparently trying to fix it. Frankly I don't think it ever worked. As my husband had injured his foot and was unable to walk we stayed in this extemely hot room for 1 1/2 days without any attempt made by the management to change us to a different location. At the end I got so irate that they agreed to move us. The new room was unacceptable as we had asked for a twin and this was a double. So we started all over again and finally were given a twin that was O.K. A first class hotel, which is their claim, would have given us another room immediately. We would never stay there again. There are many other hotels in the same price range where the management really looks after its patrons."
210,678,Oct 21 2005	outstanding care-food and service	my wife and i stayed here for more than three weeks because of my accident. THE care and service they gave us during this time and also to our visiting two sons from MONTREAL CANADA was outstanding and for that we thank you very very much. WHEN we return to LONDON and we will the CROWNE PLAZA HOTEL-ST. JAMES will be our home away from home for sure. THANK you again for a great vacation. BRYAN and SHIRLEY NIX.
211,678,"Oct 15 2005 	I almost stayed!	I stay in London a lot on business; usually at one of several favourites. I always check that there is broadband access before booking as I need to be connected to work. I decided to have a change and having made the broadband checks, I booked my room. I checked in and found that their reservations system had booked me in THREE times. OK, this was sorted and refunds made for the two extra rooms. Not good nonetheless.The room I was shown was fine. Nothing special for a Crown Plaza, but adequate. Except that it had no broadband access! So I call and they find me another room just down the corridor. Well, I thought I was in a different hotel! The bed was so worn it was almost on the floor below; the general appearance was shabby to be polite, the bathroom was tiny. BUT it did have broadband! So I connect up only to find that and evenings work on the net is going to cost me 27! This is twice the usual rate for broadband in London hotels. I called one of my regular hotels, booked a room and left the Crown Plaza and I wont be going back.I did speak with the duty manager on the way out and let him know of my disappointment. He offered to find me another room (the third) but as the internet access was still going to be 27, I declined. Bid him farewell and headed for the Mandeville where internet is only 12!I did speak with the duty manager on the way out and let him know of my disappointment. He offered to find me another room (the third) but as the internet access was still going to be 27, I declined. Bid him farewell and headed for the Mandaville where internet is only 12!"
212,678,"Sep 19 2005 	Not up to par	First, the good. The location of this hotel is fantastic; if you are reasonably athletic, you can walk to nearly any tourist attraction in London from this hotel. Yes, Buckingham Palace is just up the street, but you can also walk to Piccadilly Circus, Bond St. shopping, Harrods, and even the West End from here. Also, road noise is very minimal, since it's located on a very quiet side street (surrounded by foreign embassies, FYI).I really don't like giving negative reviews to hotels, especially since this particular one seems to be a favorite among the other reviewers here, but quite honestly I expected a lot more. And this isn't me being a naive American either; I actually prefer the small, efficient, clinically clean hotel rooms that I'm used to seeing in Europe...it's just that's not what I got at the Crowne Plaza St. James.First impressions are very good. The lobby is spacious, well decorated, and easy to navigate. A quick peak inside the adjoining restaurants reveals a clean environment and pleased-looking patrons. But from here it goes downhill; for starters, the check-in staff was quite rude, more so than I've seen at any other Priority Club hotel in Europe or America. The elevator up to our room creaked and strained terribly, and even seemed to slip once or twice; certainly not very confidence-inspiring. And although the hallways on our floor were beautifully decorated with framed artwork and Victorianesque lighting and wallpaper, the room itself was old and tired-looking.The furniture was scuffed, the curtains were fading. The double-bed (the equivalent to &quot;full&quot; in America) was springy and clad in rough-feeling sheets and a blanket of questionable cleanliness. Also, bizarrely, it seemed to have been designed for midgets, as the bed and box spring were sitting on the floor, with no bedframe whatsoever. I would imagine that physically disabled individuals would find it very difficult to get into or out of this bed.The bathroom was adequate, although the shower head was quite nice. The room itself had a view of an adjacent brick wall. When we called down to check-in to see if we could request a different room, we were told that we had ALREADY been upgraded (?) to a Superior Room and that there were no other rooms available. I would hate to see what a Standard Room looks like...The odd part is that my brother-in-law, who was traveling in my party at the time, ALSO ended up in a Superior Room, except that his was over twice the size of ours (almost a suite), looked out over a gorgeous courtyard, and had an enormous bathroom with a bay window and dual vanity. The front desk, however, insisted that both of our rooms were the same room class and that there was nothing they could do about it.Quite honestly, you can get better rooms and better service at Express by Holiday Inn, for half the price. This hotel, judging by my experience, isn't worthy of the &quot;Crowne Plaza&quot; name, to say nothing of the prices they charge."
213,678,"Sep 14 2005	It got better!	As a couple we stayed for a single night in August 2005 deciding to try this hotel instead of our usual London pads.Despite the grand entrance foyer, the first impressions were disappointing as although Priority Club Platinum Members we couldn't check in at Noon as they didn't have a room available. When we returned later found we had been allocated a basic room (least hope it wasn't a higher standard) but by then didn't have time to change rooms before an evening engagement.Room was overlooking the nice quiet courtyard but the bathroom was the smallest ever seen and we had to take turns to use the one chair in the room (even though it was booked and set out as a double room). Furnishings were fine but nothing outstanding.Still we had a comfortable and peaceful night and my wife enjoyed the use of the room the next day until early afternoon (so we just about got our 22 hours out of the day). Bell staff looked after our bag well without fuss and we really enjoyed the happy hour cocktails in the Courtyard Bar before catching our evening train.The location is quite central but really best for those with business in Whitehall. It is a bit out of the way from most of the theatres and many of the tourist attractions as the nearest tube is on the District and Circle Line and the bus services from nearby Victoria Street serve a limited number of destinations - so for most places two buses or a change of tube is required or walk 15 minutes to Victoria Station. Buck House and Houses of Parliament are however walkable in about the same time.Would we go back? We might, but probably not. More likely to use the Courtyard Bar or the Restuarant or Bistro and stay elsewhere.The major gripe is that despite it being contrary to the Sale of Goods Act, the Holiday Inn website insists on quoting a VAT exclusive price for this and a limited number of other Holiday Inn hotels in London. So watch out you don't get charged 17.5% more than you expected. If you are misled by this, the Trading Standards department of Westminster City Council is just round the corner!"
214,678,"Sep 13 2005	Another enthusiastic thumbs-up!	Storms coming thru here, so the detailed review I just finished composing has been lost. So - fewer details this time around. Plainly and simply - we were very, very pleased!! Great bathroom, plumbing, tub, towels. Comfy bed heaped with pillows. Excellent location, along with proximity to the Victoria Rd. bus lines, there was also plentiful shopping and a Sainsbury supermarket about a two minute shortcut trot from the hotel. Set on a fairly quiet street (tho near to New Scotland Yard, so there are occasional siren wails - but that's part of being in a city, isn't it?)We had three huge windows that, while they did not offer a courtyard or scenic view, did open (a big plus with us) and let the light stream in. Street noise was negligible. And it appeared that most windows on the courtyard side had been retrofitted and were a good deal smaller. Courtyard was delightful. Lush landscaping and a bubbling fountain.Would stay there again in a heartbeat."
215,678,"Sep 9 2005	We Absolutely Loved This Hotel!!!	For our 17 year wedding anniversary, my wife and I treated ourself to a trip to London. We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in August 2005.Upon our arrival we were upgraded to a suite with a beautiful courtyard view and a complimentary bottle of champagne. We were also permitted to check in early at 9:30 am.The room was wonderful with everything we needed. I couldn't figure out how to operate the safe in the closet, so I called the reception desk and someone came to our room to help within 5 minutes.The room was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was spotless. The entire staff was extremelly friendly, courteous, and helpful. The breakfast buffet was excellent with eggs, sausage, bacon, mushrooms, beans, juices, breads, cheeses, cereals, fruits, cold cuts,pastries, etc. The location of the hotel is great.It's a short 10 minute walk from Victoria Station and a 3 minute walk from the St. James tube (subway) stop. But we travelled around mostly by bus. There's a bus stop right around the corner on Victoria Street only 2 minutes away which would take us to just about anyplace in London.Again, great hotel, great service, great location. We couldn't ask for anything better.Highly recommended and we definately will return soon."
216,678,"Aug 23 2005	Great Hotel Great Rooms Great Location	We had a great stay from Aug 15-20. As other people have noted, there is a smoking area in the lobby and as a result a slight smell of smoke is evident when entering the lobby. But, that was the biggest negative. We had 2 rooms on the second floor with twin beds that were pushed together. The rooms were identical and were about 12 by 15 feet and had nice furnishings that were in very good condition. The service was very good. There were a couple of worn spots on the hallway carpets, but otherwise every thing was in excellant condition. The room was booked via Cunard and therefore they would not give me Priority Points , but I did get a daily news paper and free local phone calls. The charge to call the local 0800 number for MCI was 1.50 pounds. The included buffet breakfast was adequate, but was more limited than I have previously had in the UK. (only hot items were: scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, beans, there was also a few sliced meats, a few selections of fruit and pastries plus juices and coffee and tea). The location is excellent and we walked through St James park several times to various central london locations. When we took a cab, most locations were 6- 8 pounds including tip. Overal we had an excellent stay and would stay here again."
217,678,"Aug 16 2005	Beautiful hotel but rooms need improvement	We booked our citytrip through Thomas Cook Belgium which has the Crowne Plaza St James ranked as their n1 hotel in London.Obviously the location of the hotel , the lobby, the upscale restaurants (Bank, Zander, Bistro 51,...)and the welnesscenter are all worth the 4 stars.The rooms on the other side need to be remodeled if they want to keep up the high standards. We upgraded two times (from standard to superior to deluxe) before we had a little bit that 4 star feeling. And even in the deluxe room, the bathroom looks like your worst nightmare bathroom (DIY for beginners...).All by all we would possibly return to the Crowne Plaza St James for their F&amp;B, friendly staff and the good feeling we had about the hotel itself."

219,678,"Jun 14 2005	Great Hotel top Location mosty good staff.	I stayed at the crowne from a friday to sunday.all in all i thought the hotel was great in my opinion,the room was very clean very roomy and an ideal location within minutes of the sights of london, probably 2 mins walk to the palace,also try to get a courtyard view.I would of given the hotel an excellent rating apart from the odd thing, when arriving I was wearing tracksuits bottoms and trainers just so I would be comfortable on the drive down, upon entering the hotel the gentleman at the concierge desk looked me up and down as if I was something he had stood in and totally ignored me ,had I not been with my family I would have confronted him as I was a little annoyed to say the least,Although the attendant who helped me to the car park was nothing but charming and courteous and a credit to the hotel.The reception staff were also first class.I have stayed at many quality hotels in London, hotel 41,Draycott hotel, and believe this hotel with a little more thought could be just as good for a lot less .I would stay again without doubt."
220,678,"May 9 2005	Location location location	Lovely, friendly hotel with an American bent. You'll appreciate the plumbing, I guarantee it. After traveling extensively in the UK this hotel is above average and with the two &quot;bars&quot; and wonderful restaurants it's a sure bet we'll be staying again. Location is ideal, you can walk everywhere and the tube is steps away. Safe and secure. I recommend it highly."
221,678,"May 7 2005 	Will Not Stay There Again	Checked in at 9 PM to a small room with a window facing a brick wall with an HVAC unit outside, pretty noisy. The room was very hot, the AC did not work. I went down to the desk &amp; asked if they could look at it while I grabbed a bite to eat. Came back &amp; they opened my window, still no AC, to the crappy brick wall &amp; noise!The room had no hand towels as I disovered at 11:30PM!!You will need to wait for an elevator, only 2 with 1 working and it stops at every floor going up or down!!!Next day I complained &amp; got a beautiful room with a view.OK hotel, convenient to Buckingham Palace"
222,678,"Apr 14 2005	Visit of London	Our family of three stayed her for two seperate nights-Sat. March 26th and Friday April 2nd. Our first overnight was great. They were very helpful and breakfast we just wonderful! The location of the hotel is super-a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and a 10 -15 minute walk to the Thames. Our 2nd night, however, was a bit different. Our key would not work in the door, we had to walk to the front desk-not a short walk as the hotel is in an interesting shape-there was a problem with the lock, so my family left the hotel for over 8 hours to sightsee. When we returned, our door was fixed, but we found out that we had no cold water-only scalding hot! Called the front desk and someone was to come up right away-15 minutes went by-finally called back down to ask for another room -we were giving that, but decided that we had too much to carry to another room, especially since it was close to 9pm. Asked for a discount on the room-after management was rude and tried to put the blame on us for the key not intially working!-management said that they would need to check into that-they called back and said, &quot;Yes, we will give you a 30 % room discount.&quot; Perfect-we thought. Got down to breakfast in the am only to discover that they would not allow us to have the &quot;breakfast included in you room rate&quot; deal that we had made prior to coming! Talked to management again-no, not included in your room price-luckily I pushed and they finally included it. Very nice. I had a copy of the original confirmation in our room that said b-fast was included. Also, upon checkout, the door man insisted on carrying our bags back into the hotel while we waited for our taxi-once the taxi arrived the doorman tried to scam 10 pounds out of the taxi driver for a tip! Anyway, LOVED the location, Loved the breakfast, Loved that they gave us a discount on our room, but did not love the scamming, nor the difficulties to get into a room, take a bath, etc."
223,678,"Mar 20 2005	Not a 4-star experience/Watch your luggage	I traveled to London with a study abroad group of graduate students in March of 05. We stayed several nights, went to France, and then returned to the hotel for one more night before flying home. Unfortunately, I did not have positive experiences with this hotel. I felt that, for a 4 star hotel, the front desk staff was incredibly rude and to top it off one of my friends had his laptop stolen right from the hotel lobby. First, a little about the hotel: The location is fantastic; it is walking distance to Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. Rooms vary widely in terms of size and distance from the elevator. We stayed at the hotel two separate times, and one time we had an &quot;upgraded&quot; big room near the elevator and another time we had a tiny room buried in some corner of the hotel. The small room had a lovely view of the courtyard. The big room had a view of other hotel rooms. The furniture in the hotel rooms was nice. The lobby is beautiful but does smell like smoke. If you don't smoke, make sure to get on a non-smoking floor because all the other rooms reek of smoke. Breakfast was included in my package, and I found it to be okay. Service in the dining room was good. We did ask for a room with two beds and received a room in which the beds were zipped together. Housekeeping unzipped them for us and moved them apart. We arrived at our rooms a little early, around noon, and the hotel generously checked us in early. When I keyed into my room, there was a man in it and the smell of furniture solvent emanating from the room about knocked me over. The man explained he was repairing the finish on the furniture and the room was supposed to be empty. He said it wasn't his fault and left. I was jetlagged, and all I really wanted was a nap in a room that wasn't full of toxic fumes. We called the desk and asked for a different room on account of the strong smell of furniture solvent. The desk told us what we smelled was not furniture solvent, but a lavender smell from the inserts from the drawers. I explained it was not the lavender, it was furniture solvent, and then was told it was a &quot;normal&quot; furniture polish smell in the room. The (rude) woman wanted me to wait in the room for who-knows-how-long until they could find us a different room. The air in the room was completely unbreathable, so my roommate and I waited in the hall for a couple minutes and then hauled our luggage back down to the lobby to wait for a room. They did find us another room, but not before the woman at the front desk told us our noses were &quot;overly&quot; sensitive to a &quot;normal&quot; furniture polish smell. At that last comment, if I had not been staying with a group, my response to this woman would have been to immediately take my business elsewhere.Our last night in Europe, we checked in to the hotel around 10:30pm. My friend's laptop was stolen right from the lobby as he checked in by a man and a woman working together. We found this out after the hotel reviewed the security tape. The hotel said it was &quot;the start of the season.&quot; The hotel did buy my friend a drink at the hotel bar. The morning I was preparing to leave, I had no British pounds but desperately wanted a bottle of water. I tried to buy water from the hotel gift shop but I was not allowed to charge it to my room. I was not allowed to charge it to my credit card, either, because the woman was &quot;new&quot; and did not know how to do credit card sales. She couldn't fetch anyone who could do them, either.I would not recommend this hotel for leisure travelers and I would not return to it."
224,678,"Mar 18 2005	51 Buckingham Gate	I'm not sure how to do this - as I don't want to write a review for the Crowne Plaza itself - instead for its suites located next door at 51 Buckingham Gate. We recieved an incredible deal for a 1 bedroom suite for a week in London. The bathroom was incredible - huge separate garden tub, shower, fantastic full size molton brown toiletries. the kitchen was well appointed and the washing machine a bonus (for those of us who are used to handwashing our gym clothes). cd player. dvd player. sitting area. television in both bedroom and living room. high sppeed internet and a gym. all amenities and everything modern and serene. I look back at our week spent here so fondly - it was a like a home away from home. Go to http://www.51buckinghamgate.com to book ..."
225,678,"Feb 1 2005	Location Location Location	The entrance and lobby are impressive.....polished dark wood, marble, comfy lounge sofas.The rooms a a little less modern than anticipated after seeing the lobby (as I usually like modern hotels), although my mother described it as quaint English style - so if thats what you are after you may like it. It has everything you need, and is spotless, but it was maybe a little too 'English' for my liking. A bit frilly.One plus was that our standard room no. 558 had a door opening onto a balcony, where we overlooked the pretty central courtyard with fountain. I imagine on a summers day this would be lovely.The bathroom is spotless, marble, with great shower. In comparison with my parents rooms next door, our bathroom was smaller but the bedroom bigger, and vice versa for my parents. I personally didn't class the room as small at all. There was a lounge chair, coffee table, 2 bedside tables, a desk, TV with about 10 channels, and mirrored bar alcove, with plenty of room for the 2 of us.The hotel apparently has a gym, although because we were only there one night we didn't use it. There is also a sauna and jacuzzi but no pool. Also within the hotel are 3 restaurants, and 2 bars. The bar we have visited many times before on previous trips is Zanders, which has the longest bar in Europe. Expect to pay a good 20 for a round, the same applies to the Hampton bar inside the hotel, where a Baileys, 2 whisky &amp; Cokes and a Mai Tai cocktail were 28.Victoria tube station was baout 5-7 mins walks, past several cafes, cash points and if you must, a Mcdonalds &amp; Burger King - all around the Victoria area.St James Park tube station is closer, although we didn't use that one.The best thing for me was the location. It's not too far from the tube, it's on Buckingham gate which always feels very 'London' to me, and you are only 2 mins walk from the Queens house so that can't be bad. I prefer this sort of location rather than being smack bang in the middle of Picadilly. One of the best parts was getting off at Green Park tube station, and walking through the park, past the palace and then to the hotel, in total only a 15 minute walk.As a general rule, I really woulnd't worry which area of London you stay in, as long as it's relatively safe, and you are near a tube station, then you are sorted. Although I'd recommend the Crowne Plaza St James - just don't expect the world."
226,678,"Jan 30 2005	Very nice hotel will stay again	My husband and I stayed here this past New Year's Eve and had a great time. The room was very clean and well appointed. The marble bath room was very large (for Europe) with amazingly soft bath towels and personal robes with a towel warmer. The room had a great heating system with an electronic thermostat. The included-buffet breakfast was very filling and had a nice variety of cold and cooked foods. The concierge gave us great tips on where to go and how to beat the crowds, especially on New Year's Eve. You can not beat the location, St. James station is across the street and Buckingham Palace is around the corner. Westminster Abbey is also a short walking distance.My only complaint was the view. We stared at an empty lot filled with loud vagrants. I tried to get a garden view, but the hotel was completely booked. They claimed there was nothing they could do.If you want a hotel that is safe, clean, with very large rooms and in a great location this is the hotel for you. You will definitely find cheaper hotels, but this hotel guarantees a wonderful vacation. Just make sure you ask for a garden view!"
227,678,"Jan 26 2005	Pleasant stay very convenient location	I stayed in a room with a king-sized bed. (I assume it was a &quot;deluxe&quot; or &quot;superior&quot; designation, but I am not sure because it was part of a package.) The room was spacious, and overlooked a beautiful courtyard. The hotel has at leat 8 floors... I recommend a high floor with the courtyard view. The baths were modern and very nice. The staff were quite accomodating and helpful and the location is PERFECT. Very close to almost all major tourist destinations.Unfortunately, I didn't get to the health club, but heard from a friend who used the facilities that was great, too. I recommend this hotel. I enjoyed it. p.s. The full breakfast buffet is extremely large and filling!"
228,678,Dec 27 2004	Entrance main Lobby stunk always with smokers toxic fumes	Got a nonsmoking room but apparently in UK it is OK to subject people to it in their main lobby. It was like a pub. Awful. Had to run through it and hold breath. Huge lobby. They had a nonsmoking sign at the check-in desk. What a joke. Those poor employees who chose not to smoke are smoking everyday and every hour. Will never return even if it is a nice old hotel in good location. Expense. London has lots of hotels to choose from and we stayed one night in early December 04. Due to my husband having conference in the east end we moved to the Holiday Inn Express which did not have this smokers section problem in the lobby as it was small. And was not a Crowne Plaza but was extremely clean and well taken care of. The Indian restaurant next door to Crowe Plaza St. James is excellent and voted best in London. We agree.
229,678,"Dec 9 2004	Dirty room and poor service. Stay somewhere else!	I booked into the Crowne Plaze St James's for a one night stay in December 2004. At check in, I was told that I had been allocated a suite. Obviously I thought this was a bonus - however, the suite turned out to be in a different building which trades as 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and is not even part of the main hotel (it requires a walk across a courtyard into a different entrance).The suite was by far the dirtiest and most tired hotel room I have ever stayed in (and I stay in hotels 3+ nights every week). The carpets and walls were stained, the wallpaper was torn and there was mould on the walls in the bathroom. The table in the living area was broken and none of the furniture matched properly. No room service was available. Overall, the general ambience was that of a student flat which hadn't been refurbished since the 1970s.I had arrived late at night and so decided not to make a fuss that evening (how British!), but instead to make some comments to the staff at checkout the next morning. Having expressed my disappointment to the reception clerk, all I got was a generic &quot;I'm sorry&quot; but no sense that the clerk was at all bothered or thought it a problem. I then asked to speak to the duty manager who, after a 5 minute wait, arrived and offered to make sure I had a good room on my next visit. Talk about missing the point. There are lots of good hotels in London - my strong advice would be to avoid the Crowne Plaza St James's and stay somewhere else."
230,678,"Dec 1 2004	Great location in London	We enjoyed our stay at the Crowne Plaza St. James. The hotel is in a good location between Victoria Station and St. James underground. For some reason there were no taxis at Victoria Sta. when we arrived, so we had to walk to the hotel. A hassle with luggage, yes, but I asked for directions in a local shop. The three people working there all knew exactly where it was. We had the standard room which was fine. The bathroom was large by London standards. We requested extra bath towels and received them everyday without any problems. Face cloths seemed to be in short supply; a few days we did not have them. I requested them and they did find them.We had no problems walking from St. James tube station to the hotel after dinner or theatre, as this is probably one of the safest areas in London-no need to waste money on taxis. Another advantage to this hotel is that it is not on a busy street, so it does not have the noise problems so common with most European city hotels.Just down the street is the Albert pub, whose upstairs has an excellent carvery style restaurant for reasonable prices.One word of warning though: Do not make outgoing calls from the hotel room. I inquired at the front desk what the cost was (it is not posted anywhere in the hotel info. book in the room) and was told 30 pence per minute. Two local phone calls totalling 8 minutes cost amost 26 pounds-more than 10 times the rate they told me. When I asked about this charge, the reply was that the number I called (in London) was a mobile phone, and thus more expensive."
231,678,"Nov 21 2004	WOULD NOT RETURN NOR RECOMMEND	Crowne Plaza St. James is a nice, older hotel that is probably better suited to business travel than leisure trips. The hotel is on a street (Buckingham Gate) that a taxi driver told us has had a name change in the past few years, so even though it is quite near Victoria Station we finally had to get in a cab and be taken the 4 blocks to it as NO ONE in any shop or business could give us directions! It is just a few blocks from the St. James tube station, but the walk is down a street with nothing--only the back of the hotel and no shops or people, so we were not comfortable using the tube at night to return to our hotel. This meant extra GBP spent on taxis after the theater.We stayed here two nights Nov. 16-18, for $110 per night, and I would not return to this hotel. We were immediately identified as Priceline customers upon check-in &quot;Oh, yes, you will be in room so-and-so, and breakfast is NOT included in your room rate!&quot; That didn't matter to us, of course, and the room was very nice except for the bathroom. The vanity top around the sink had a huge crack with a gap about 1/2 centimeter wide that had been filled with clear epoxy. It was very shabby but clean. The toilet required at least 4 flushings for any reason, even a single tissue. The shower curtain did not reach all the way down to the tub edge, so each time we took a shower the floor was sopping wet. We did go along with the no sheet change request, as is common with all hotels nowadays, but we left our towels on the floor after we used them to soak up the standing water. That of course meant that we wanted new towels. They took the used towels but did not replace them. When we returned to our room after attending the theater (about 11 pm) wanting to take baths, there were no towels. A call to housekeeping and someone suggested that we &quot;look better for the towels, perhaps in the closet.&quot; I looked, saw they weren't anywhere she'd suggested and asked for &quot;Two towels, please, we are waiting for our baths.&quot; We waited for a half hour before having to call again. They arrived in about 5 minutes after the second call. The room itself was in a sort of tower, with four tall windows curved to create a tiny bowed area. They were lovely, but let in noise from the street which was disturbing early in the morning. There was nice quality woodworking, and the beds were extremely comfortable. We did not use room service, nor any of the other amenities of the hotel as we were strictly there for sightseeing and theater. The restaurants were very, very expensive (for people on expense accounts?) and room service choices limited. We saw one other woman (I was traveling with my 13-year-old son) in the hotel; all the other guests were middle-aged businessmen. (I guess this hotel is less expensive than those in The City, which would have been far more convenient for businesspeople.) All in all, I would not return to this hotel. The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum, which we stayed in the week before (see review under that hotel) was better priced ($75), better situated, had a much nicer bathroom and was simply a better value."
232,678,"Nov 4 2004	Will be back to the Crowne Plaza for our next London visit	My husband, sister-in-law and I thouroughly enjoyed our stay at the Crowne Plaza St. James. The location is excellent in regards to all tourist attractions, the hotel is beautifully kept, and the rooms were the largest I have ever seen in several trips to Europe. I especially appreciated the large bathroom with the heated towel rack! We stayed in a king superior room, which I would highly recommend for it was much larger than my sister-in-law's deluxe for not that much more money.The afternoon tea served in the Hamptons lounge was one of the best we had in London, and for a very reasonable price. Another hotel restaurant, Bistro 51, is over-priced with bad food and bad service, and I would not suggest this location as a worthwhile dining location. The one word of caution that I will offer to those thinking of making a stop at this hotel is to ask for a room in the front side of the hotel. The backside of the hotel is essentially the playground for an elementary school and the windows offer absolutley no relief from the noise. If you like sleep stay in the front half of this hotel, or hope that the kids are on holiday for the majority of your vacation (as they were for ours)."
233,678,"Oct 25 2004 	Uninspiring for a 4*	This is pretty standard offering that struggles to justify a four-star rating. Its location is good if sight-seeing is your goal, within a stone's throw of many of the usual attractions and with good public transport links. At night, though, the area lacks character, as the office workers around Victoria drift off. The hotel itself gets its four stars largely on account of the usual array of useless fripperies: concierge, trouser presses blah blah blah. If shelling-out 1.50 for a packet of polo mints or 5.50 for an 'intimacy kit' is what appeals, the Crowne Plaza's for you. Alternatively, you could choose to send a message to these rip-off merchants and opt not to spend any money over and above the cost of your roomThe rooms are pretty ordinary, though nothing to cause alarm. They're what London hoteliers call 'Edwardian' and Americans call 'small'. I got a room for 75 including taxes on Priceline - not a bad price for a 4* on a week night. All in all, not a bad hotel, but not one I'd recommend going out of your way to book."
234,678,"Sep 17 2004	location location location	Recently had a short break to London and following reviews read on trip advisor, decided to spend our night at this Hotel. On the whole we were very pleased with our choice. The location was excellent, only 10 - 15 minutes walk from Victoria Station and 5 minutes or so from St James tube station. We booked a superior room, which was of good dimensions and overlooked the lovely rear courtyard. The room was generaly fine, although the carpet was somewhat marked and a bit stained in places. The Bathroom was huge....more like a dance hall. This was spotless and clean but did seem a little dated and looked like it was time for an upgrade. The breakfast was good but no better or worse than we would have expected of a Hotel of this grade. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Would I stay here again................Yes.Trip advisor only gives me the choice of a three or four mark raiting. If I could be very accurate I would probably go three and a half. As this is not possible, in this instance I will go with four, and give this establishment the benifit of the doubt."
235,678,"Sep 16 2004	location location location	Stopped at this hotel for a night when recently visiting London (Aug 04). Read various reports on trip advisor before booking and found that on the whole these gave a fairly accurate picture of what I found. The location was excellent, just a few minutes from Victoria Station and within 5 minutes walk of St James Underground station. Having paid for a superior room, although of a fairly generous size and with a Bathroom like a small 'dance hall', I none the less thought the bathroom, whilst clean, to be a bit dated. The Bedroom was ok in itself, but found the carpet somewhat marked and soiled.The staff I found helpful and approachable. The Breakfast buffet was what I would have hoped for and indeed expected for this grade of Hotel. All in all, It ticked more boxes for me than it left empty.Would I stay here again ?............Probably yes. For this review I'm ticking four boxes, although if I could give a much more accuratate assessment I would more likely plump for a three and a half. Lets just say on this occasion I'll give them the benifit of the doubt."
236,678,"Sep 14 2004	Rooms need to be cleaned properly	I stayed at the Crowne Plaza St James twice during August 2004. The first time I got a deluxe room and it was great, found a slodge of jam (raspberry!) on the inside drawer of the desk, but aside from that, the room was great with a hallway and a great, clean bathroom, which was quite large. The staff were fine, no complaints, some queues at reception both times, but hey, utilise express checkout. The second time I stayed, it was in a standard room and what a come down! The bathroom floor was dirty and the tiles in the shower were smeared and had not been cleaned prior to my arrival. The standard rooms are fine for space though, and not poky. The bed was very soft, so if you have a bad back, better to stay elsewhere. The meals were fine, no complaints and the staff good. There is an ice machine on every second floor which is handy. I think if the staff were trained on how to clean a room properly, the place would be more desirable. If I had booked the standard room first, I would have skipped the Crowne Plaza a second time."
237,678,"Aug 31 2004	Enjoyed the Crown Plaza St. James Hotel and Suites	My family and I stayed at the Crown Plaza St. James Hotel and Suites on the nights of August 21st, 2004 and August 22nd, 2004. I had e-mailed the hotel previously requesting to check-in early because our flight arrived into the London Heathrow airport at 7:00 in the morning. I received a response within 24-hours from the manager who would be happy to add on to our reservation that we would be checking in early. The Crown Plaza is in an excellent location and within walking distance to the major tourist attractions in London. Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Parliament, Buckingham Palace, and the pier where the boats embark for rides on the Thames are all about a 10-15-minute walk away. The concierge was very helpful in arranging our tours and taxis. The whole staff was very polite and courteous.  The hotel has a business center, spa, game room, store, and restaurants.  The room we stayed in was the typical European style room. Our room had a balcony and overlooked the garden, patio, and restaurant, which was very lovely. The hotel was very clean. The only negative I have about the Crown Plaza was there were only two small elevators. The first day we were there the 2nd elevator was not working. Therefore, only one elevator was working and it was incredibly slow.  Overall, I would definitely stay again and recommend the Crown Plaza St. James Hotel and Suites to anybody traveling to London. The Crown Plaza is expensive, but very well worth the money."
238,678,"Aug 30 2004	Great Location!	We just returned from 7 nights in a 2-bedroom suite. Let me start out by saying that this hotel is in a wonderful location. Just a short stroll from Big Ben, Victoria Station or Buckingham Palace. I also want to mention that the front desk staff were great. They took wonderful care of us. Our problems started after they showed us to our 2-bedroom suite. I had specifically asked for a king room and 2 twins in the second bedroom. When they brought us up to our room, the second bedroom had a double bed. When I brought this to their attention, they said they would send someone up to split them. Of course this was impossible and they suggested splitting our king. This was unacceptable, so they found us another room. We had to wait about 5 hours to get into the new room. So we just sat around waiting. I've always wondered why people comment on the carpeting in their rooms - well, I know why now! It had stains all over it and it was dirty to boot! The bathrooms were small. The worst part was the maid services. Every day I had to leave messages like &quot;Please leave extra toilet paper&quot; (twice) and &quot;Please leave hand towels in both bathrooms&quot;. Twice they left cleaning products in the room. Twice they knocked on the door when the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign was on the door. And when we told them later, they called to find out if they could come. This all may sound petty, but when you are staying at a 5 Star hotel and paying 5 Star prices, you shouldn't have to ask for toilet paper!"
239,678,"Aug 29 2004	worth every penny...	An inceredibly pleasant stay. Peaceful, luxuriousand worth the expense. This has to be the nicestplace to stay I've come across in London ...or indeed almost anywhere. Wonderful serviceand having the facilities of the apartment madethe stay feel like a real holiday!"
240,678,"Aug 12 2004	Wonderful Hotel - Great Location!!	We booked our pre-cruise visit to London via the internet on the Crown Plaza website. We stayed there for four nights (June 2004) and were very happy indeed! The hotel is located extremely close to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Station (Bus and Train), and was a short walk to the Tube stop. For any first time or experienced visitors to London, this hotel had it all. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We did book the &quot;Deluxe King Room&quot; and were very glad that our VAT, at the time we booked, was included with the rate provided on their website. This is something to pay attention to when booking hotels in London. VAT can really add to the price of your room. Our room was large enough for two very tall people, and we were glad we booked the King room. It also included a small dressing area and a very large &quot;en suite&quot; bathroom area. We were most impressed. After hearing horror stories about room sizes in London, we were glad to see that our room was adequate and comfortable.Our Hotel rate also included a daily breakfast for two which was fabulous. They have a small cafe located in the front of the Hotel which provides you with a buffet breakfast that is very nice with plenty of choices. Since food is very expensive in London, this was a nice bonus.Without a doubt, we would chose this hotel again when we return to London!"
241,678,"Jul 12 2004	wonderful place to stay	Just spent a week at this hotel. The staff was superb, warm, friendly and efficient. They managed to organize an afternoon tea for 7 on short notice that was superb. Would recommend it. My only minor complaints, there was no outlet for a hairdryer in the bathroom and there were few drawers to place your clothing."
242,678,"Jun 30 2004	Crowne Plaza St. James Top Drawer!!!	My four day stay was super!!! A perfect spot for a person travelling alone. It is in a wonderful location , within walking distance of Buckingham Palace , in the Westminster section of the city , it is also close to some good shops and transportation.This was really a wonderful way to end my Queen Mary 2 transatlantic cruise."
243,678,"Jun 23 2004	enjoyed second stay there	stayed at the hotel for the second time this year, room was good well spaced and clean. Staff were friendly only problem like most other hotels mini bar and similar items too expensive."
244,678,"Jun 20 2004	3am Alarm Call	Excellent lobby and public rooms seem to be at odds with the quality of the standard rooms - the fittings seemed a little worn, although very comfortable and good quality bathroom. A fire alarm woke up the hotel at 1am on our stay. The on-duty staff really looked after everyone before we were allowed back to our rooms. However, the management's apology for the situation involved sending a message to the TV set at 3am waking us up again; not clever! I normally have an excellent stay in Crowne Plaza hotels - this one was not up to the usual high standard."
245,678,"Jun 4 2004	Great location quite area	I was at St. James for 6 days week of 5/18. The rooms were bigger than expected. It is centrally located Victoria Station, B-Palace). The breakfast plan was worth it. But you are also near grocery stores (Mark and Spencers and Tedco). We loaded the honor bar with fruit and snacks. The theater district is close we got a chance to she a show. Tickets are offered at a place called Half Price. Tickets are on sell  the day of the show. The staff is very good and helpful Make sure you get a 4-day bus/metro pass before you go that very helpful."
246,678,"Jun 3 2004	Excellent hotel great location	A thoroughly excellent hotel. We stayed for three nights in May 2004. We booked a standard room but upgraded to a superior room with a king-size bed overlooking the fountain, then the hotel upgraded us to a deluxe room at no extra charge. The rooms are wonderful and the spa/exercise facility is one of the best I've seen in any hotel. The staff seems to be mostly young foreigners working in London to improve their English, and they are all extremely friendly and helpful. Room service and houskeeping requests are extremely rapid. We ate at only one of the restaurants, The Bistro (several times), and it was quite good."
247,678,"May 17 2004	Wonderful choice for a family	We stayed here for five days in the spring of 2004 and had a very nice stay. It was perfect for our needs. We rented a deluxe three bedroom apartment for our family of five plus our niece who stayed with us for two nights. The quality of the furnishings is not exactly spectacular but the overall effect is very stylish and attractive, modern and appealing. The bathrooms are fantastic. And there were three. The butler service was lovely. We also enjoyed the location and the proximity to St. James Park. Great for running, taking walks, trips to the playground. We thought the price of our apartment was a bargain given the space, quality and level of service."
248,678,"Apr 2 2004	St. James Crowne Plaza - Grand Stay	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 5 nights in March and it was delightful. The staff was the tops, very helpful and friendly. The room overlooked the fountain and plaza and was extremly large by London standards. It was quite, clean and the supply and pressure of the hot water is great. The fitness center looked fantastic, we only used the spa one time too busy sight-seeing. The breakfast was plentiful and good tasting...recommend you get the full breakfast plan as it would be extremly expensive without. We just filled up in the morning and then walked it off all day. The best part is the location..2 minute walk to Buck Palace..St. James Park..maybe 5 minutes to St. James tube...great little pubs in the area also. Westminister Abby is close by along with Scotland Yard. I would love to be going every year and staying at the Crowne."

1,679,"Nov 24 2009	Nice hotel but watching the sting in the tail!	I stayed here for two nights on the 13/14th November. Its a lovely hotel. The room my sister and I shared was very generous, with two double beds. It was very well appointed and we had two lovely very peaceful comfortable nights. My only niggle was related to swiping my debit card on arrival for &quot;incidentals&quot;. The receptionist said it was commonplace to do this at a charge of 50 per night - that makes my total 100 for the 2 nights. It wasn't until I booked out that that they gave me my &quot;refund&quot; - we had charged nothing at all to the room. To my astonishment they had actually charged my card with the 100 and then told me that the actual refund should reach my bank account on the Thursday (it was then the Sunday) so be warned - they &quot;borrow&quot; your money then pay it back - cheeky or what? is this normal to actually take it then take days refunding it???? still miffed!!! : ("
2,679,"Nov 21 2009 	Not so business friendly	15 GBP for internet for a 24 hour period; I went to the business center to print some things for my meeting, they thought I was crazy when I said their color printer was out of ink as the page I was holding was all in pink."
3,679,"Nov 19 2009	Pros 	Pros - Friendly receptionists, room was nice and clean. Bed was extra bouncy. The buffet breakfast was very good, you have to ask to have your eggs cooked (fried) otherwise you eat the powdered eggs. It was a better choice than the restaurant in the lobby. Cons - Reservations for our group were in place but we arrived at 6am. We were not given a room (even after several pleas) until noon time. This is unacceptable especially when they know travelers are coming in early. - Located in a business district. Even the Starbucks, across the street, was closed by the afternoon. We enjoyed our meals at the hotel restaurants and at Black Friar's Pub across the street. - They eagerly changed our US currency into Pounds but refused to change it back to American money as we left. Their attitude was matter of fact and would not budge. - We used their concierge three times because that's how long it took for someone to answer our questions.... Example: Can we get tickets to the London Eye? - &quot;Yes but my friend has the tickets... stands there grinning. &quot; Is he around?&quot; - &quot;Yes&quot; as he stands there grinning. &quot; When will he be back?&quot; I'll check and walks off never to return. Awhile back I go back to the concierge because someone else is there. The same run around.... and the London Eye is now closed. - Next day after two more trips to the Concierge we buy our tickets for our visit. Over all I would recommend this hotel with information on the &quot;cons&quot; section. Be prepared for the &quot;sticker shock&quot; of even a small glass of wine. It's very expensive in London. If you ask for 100 pounds it will cost roughly $150.00. We learned that sometimes, if you use your credit card (exchanging pounds and euros) that it doesn't cost as much."
4,679,"Nov 17 2009 	Comfortable Hotel	This hotel is situated in the Financial district of London so a lot of the shops &amp; coffee places surrounding it are closed on the weekend, for supplies &amp; food at this time you have to go a little further afield. It is located across the road from the Blackfriers tube station although it is being worked on and is closed until sometime in 2010 so check this before you go. Although it is quite easy if on the Circle / District line to get off at Temple and walk, it only takes about 5  10 mins. Not sure if this would be the same if you get off at Mansion House. Also the St Pauls stop on the Central line is about 5  10mins as well. Because of its location it is a nice quiet hotel at the weekend The room that we had was upgraded to a deluxe although it looked like a standard room in any other hotel with TV, Desk, Sofa and table. The room was a good enough size though in that you were able to put any luggage in the corner out of the way so you arent tripping over it.The bedside table on both sides had a little counter and a shelf but for some reason on one side they put a big red box which on further investigation turned out to be a drawer, really didnt fit in with the rest of the room. The room did have adjustable heat / cold so you could regulate the temperature, it also did have tea &amp; coffee making facilities with a mini bar. The bed was really comfortable and the curtains overlapped each other so you couldnt be wakened by the sun shining in which I really likedThe bathroom was a good size with a bath / shower which had good water pressure and there was a lot of towels provided We had breakfast each morning which was the standard breakfast buffet you have come to expect although the scrambled eggs were really good. We also had dinner in the downstairs bar / lounge area at reception as the other 2 restaurants were closed on a Sunday evening and this place had their last food orders at 10pm on a Sunday night. This place only served burgers, sandwiches, pies and salad but is a very relaxing place to sit and have something to eat and a drink. We actually never went into the bar and never saw anyone else in it when we walked pastThe staff were friendly and there was a different concierge every time I went over and the scale of helpfulness did vary a bit between not really sure to very informative but they were able to provide us with a blackberry charger when we needed itAll in all it was a very comfortable hotel just off Fleet Street which is close enough to all other areas and particularly Covent Garden which has more options for dinner / drinks on the weekend"
5,679,Nov 10 2009 	Personalized Service Central Location	Great service. The front desk makes sincere effort to ensure you have a pleasant stay. Good location.
6,679,"Nov 9 2009 	Great Hotel great staff good location a definite yes!	I felt compelled to write a review of this hotel after having a fantastic stay. The hotel was absolutely beautiful inside, blending in with its surroundings - you would easily walk right past it. Upon arrival, a staff member in training was absolutely fantastic in checking us in. When we arrived at the room, the phone rang and reception had asked if our bags had been sent up yet. The room itself (and entire hotel) was absolutely spotless, very modern in appearance, and extremely comfortable. Thoughtful design went into the building, which had two restaurants (Chinese &amp; Italian), very nice foyer/lounge area. Rooms were slightly moderately bigger than expected, a nice bathroom with a big bath. The Concierge was always very helpful, as were all staff. The only negatives would be the walking distance to the nearest underground station at Temple (Blackfriars station is outside the hotel, but closed until 2011). The hotel also lacks complimentary Wi-fi in the rooms, however it does provide this on the Ground Floor and a wired service in the rooms at a hefty surcharge.Im not easily impressed, but this hotel ticks all the boxes. A definite recommendation."
7,679,Nov 9 2009 	Very modern and excellent location	We stayed at this hotel as we were not impressed with our previous stay at the Strand Palace. I went with my best friend (We are both 27.) This hotel is in a great location for the west end and ideal for those that want to stay out clubbing. We also had very nice food in the pub on the same street. The hotel is very clean and very modern. We would love to stay here again!
8,679,"Oct 23 2009 	So nice!	All the staff has been so friendly and helpfull! Thank You verry much! That's all I want to say. The rest of the hotel has been also fine. The Thames is close by, it's a 15-20 minutes walk to the Tower of London"
9,679,Oct 13 2009 	Great Hotel	We really enjoyed our stay at the Crown Plaza. The room was always clean and quiet - the bathroom was really nice - lots of space to put things. We had room service a few times and it was excellent and reasonable. The concierge was very helpful. We were able to walk from the hotel to the Thames. We would definitely stay there again!
10,679,"Oct 9 2009 	Fantastic position loved this hotel	I stayed here with my daughter and mother for a week in July while my daughter attended a course. We have never stayed in this area of London and was Pleasently surprised. The hotel suited us perfectly. The rooms wehere nice, airy and very quite. We had a small sitting area which was nice. The position was perfect and as the tube station (Blackfiars)is closed we decided to use the busses. The bus stop is literally outside the door and they are so frequent it was so so easy to get around. The area its self felt so safe and we soon felt like locals. We stay in London 6/7 times a year and will now make this our first choice."
11,679,"Oct 6 2009 	Very nice stay	I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 10 nights last week. I got an amazing rate off of Orbitz - about half off the per room night so it was definitely within my budget. I'd stay there again if I got a similar deal but am not sure that I would otherwise - it is too pricey for me.I had a lovely room on the inner courtyard. I asked for a quiet room and got it - room 420. The room had 2 double beds, chairs, table, desk, safe and decent wardrobe. The room was spacious and not cramped so I could spreadout over my 10 nights. The bathroom was also very good sized for London. The one issue I had was the height of the bathtub which made it a bit difficult to climb in and out of. Other than that - great water pressure and plenty of hot water. I also got a free paper of my choice every morning delivered to my door. I never tried the food at the hotel and the staff I saw was very nice.I loved the location and it's partly why I picked it. It's the perfect location to walk almost anywhere I needed to which I prefer to do so that I can enjoy my surroundings. Keep in mind that the tube at Blackfriars is closed until 2011 so if you arrive from the airport on the tube - you will need to walk from Temple. it wasn't a bad walk but I didn't have much luggage."
12,679,"Oct 4 2009 	ABSOLUTELY GREAT!	We stayed at this Crowne Plaza in September, and while the price is a bit steep, the staff was amazing!They made us feel like a million dollars! We were upgraded when they found out it was our honeymoon, gave us incredible service and local information, gave me a voltage converter so my flat iron would work, scheduled bus tours - you name it!The hotel was beautiful and the room was super quiet and immaculately clean!Very easy transportation and plenty of nearby cheap pubs - I highly recommend Blackfriar's across the street and don't miss The Cheshire Cheese a few blocks away.Only two drawbacks - yes, the breakfast and other restaurant meals in the hotel are ridiculously priced, so go out! And...if you're looking for drawers, forget it.Most European hotels seem to leave drawers and cabinets off their renovation list.What a great stay - we will definitely go back!"
13,679,"Oct 2 2009 	Good room but don't pay extra for breakfast	Enjoyed a good room for two night using up my Nectar points, so good value to us in that sense. Check-in was quick and friendly. Room was clean and comfortable and relatively spacious by London standards. The bar is pleasant and worth a visit.My main gripe is that they wanted to charge 22 for a buffet breakfast. If they served top quality ingredients freshly cooked, I would consider paying this amount, but I've yet to have a buffet breakfast I would call good quality. I recommend exploring around for better value.My other problem was that Blackfriars underground station is closed for refurbishment until 2010, meaning a 500m walk from e.g. Temple station."
14,679,"Sep 27 2009 	Great hotel... as long as your not a young girl...	Hotel is very nice, a lovely lobby area where a piano is played, nice bar, dining area, etc. We had the set menu, which was also very nice, a choice of about 3 things for starter, main and desert, though the choices aren't changed on a regular basis. Location is perfect, about 2 minute walk from St James' Underground, and close to Buckingham Palace. Room size is what you would expect for the price, nicely set out and clean. Although expensive, this hotel is ideal for a few nights, especially business purposes (they have a lot of business rooms avaliable).However... one member of staff was a tad over-friendly. Stepping out of the lift after checking in, I must have looked slightly confused, as the place is a bit like a rabbit's warren with all windy corridors, so a deputy manager stepped out the lift and asked if I would like to be shown to my room. Very helpful, and I accepted. As we were walking, he put his arm round my waist, stroked my back until we reached my room. Half an hour later, I went down to meet my colleagues in the lobby, and he was there and asked if I would like to be shown the business rooms. Should have said no, but wanted to be polite, so accepted. Followed him down there, and then he showed me the spa and the gardens, all very nice. As we walked back, he opened a suite door and asked if I would like a look, I said that I best be getting back, but he inisted, so to be polite, again, I went in. He said: &quot;Isn't it beautiful?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes it's lovely&quot; and he said &quot;Not as beautiful as you&quot; and offered me to go for a drink with him, after saying no, he then said he would send a drink up to my room, which I then said no to again, and this carried on for a while.. all the time him trying to stroke my back and me flinching away. A lot of things can be said from it - yes, the staff are friendly (lol), and yes hindsight says I should have said no, as saying yes may have been suggestive in someway? Anyway.. take from it what you will... apart from this though, I had a very lovely stay at the Plaza."
15,679,"Sep 27 2009 	Great location great values; only ok rooms	We stayed at this Hotel in spring of this year. What attracted us to this hotel was that they were able to accommodate my family (wife and to young kids) in a single room which is difficult to come by at many London hotels. The price we booked online was excellent, for London. Upon arrival, we were much impressed by the facade of the Hotel. This favourable impression continued as we went into the lobby to check in. Very modern, chic insides so far. When we got to our room, we found it to be quite small, but this is London so we were not surprised. However, the decor in the room was quite bland. The beds were also uncomfortable for a Crown Plaza. Housekeeping was very good and we had no issues whatsoever.The best quality of this hotel is its location. It is opposite Blackfriars tube station (closed when we went unfortunately) and 5 minutes from St. Paul's. It is only a 15 minute walk to Covent Garden, 15 minutes to Westminster Abbey. What this means is that you are a little walk aways from the restuarants and evening activities but it lent itself to quiet nights in our hotel. Little street noise if any. We would stay here again especially if traveling with children."
16,679,Sep 27 2009 	what a difference a year makes	Last year I stayed here &amp; was very impressed with the service &amp; was keen to return but oh dear; standards seem to have slipped somewhat e.g. even in the first hour we were not informed about a planned fire test &amp; had to go looking for somebody to see whether this was the real thing when the alarm went off. We also had to go hunting for supplies to have a cup of tea. There was inaccurate information in the room about the restaurant facilities which was compounded by further wrong information being given by the person at the desk - it turned out that one was closed for refurbishment &amp; the other would be opening much later than we'd been told. The rest of the weekend was OK but not a patch on my first visit.
17,679,"Sep 24 2009 	Good location 	Very friendly &amp; helpfull staff. Big rooms for London. Only down side was the breakfast which wasn't up to the standard of the rest of the service,"
18,679,"Sep 23 2009 	Great hotel!	Stayed for 3 nights. The room was booked through British Airways. We loved it from the first minute. Check in was a breeze. Very friendly and nice staff in all departemts. Breakfast was delicious, and no waiting in line as is often the case.The room was modern and tastefully decorated. And there were two armchairs. The beds were very comfortable, and the items in the mini bar were moderately priced (compared to other hotels). They also offered complimentary bottled water. Nice!We had absolutely nothing to complain about, and we will stay there again for sure.Highly recommended!"
19,679,"Sep 1 2009 	Great Hotel with excellent staff	My husband's comment &quot; i find the hotel pretty good, in a great location the good thing about it, no breakfast so watch out which is pretty expensive almost 60pounds for 2person. close to all tourist attractions. All your staff are very nice/accommodating/courteous and helpful, from Lee/Yanis/Mack or Mick(concierge) to the reception : angelo/carlo/ all the girls. The only trouble we had is with the breakfast charges because i made a booking with priceline breakfast included, i was surprised that it's not included and i was told by your colleague that priceline always do that which will have a bad impression in your hotel, should we know that we will be charge for more than fifty pound for the two of us we should have enjoyed our breakfast, we (me and my husband) had cofee, a slice of bread, little fruits, spoonful of egg because i made an arrangement for a tour through your concierge for the evan evans - bath/stonehenge/windsor and the time is limited if we knew we should have eaten more. Wish we had a room with a view. They have everything i expected expect for the breakfast that's why i'm only rating them very good instead of excellent. Another drawback is the blackfriars station being closed but still temple and mansion house station is close by. Would still recommend for people to stay."
20,679,"Aug 29 2009 	Great location	Thank you for making my holiday in London a memorable one. Your staff are wonderful and very helpful with our needs during our stay. Your location is a plus, centrally located, I have a very good walking exercise everyday and enjoying the beautiful scenery of London's historical places.If I plan to re visit London, definitely, 19 New Bridge Street Crowne Plaza Hotel will be on my mindThank you very much"
21,679,"Aug 28 2009 	Excellent Friendly Hotel	Booked a 2 night midweek stay. Am a Priority Club Platinum Member, and booked a Club Room, but was upgraded to a Junior Suite, bonus!The check in staff were really friendly and helpful and answered all my questions and even remembered me by name when I returned the following day to ask a question.The room was located on the First Floor, so the views weren't great but from previous stays, views from the higher floors are nice. The room was exceptionally clean and tidy with a marble finished bathroom. Those booking Club Rooms or Suites are given access to the Club Lounge on the 6th floor. This is decent sized and didnt get too busy during the times I tried it. Free WiFi access is provided along with a wide selection of drinks and canapes. Complimentary continental breakfast was provided in the lounge for those in Club Rooms.Only downside, which is no fault of the Hotel's is London Blackfriars station across the road is undergoing major refurbishment as part of the Thameslink project. So this means the Tube Station is closed so need to arrive by National Rail services or by bus. However the Hotel is ideally situated for most tourist attractions and I was able to get across London with ease from the Hotel.Overall I was exceptionally pleased with my stay and would definately recommend it ahead of all the other Crowne Plaza Hotels in London."
22,679,"Aug 16 2009 	London holiday after 29 years away!	I trained at a London hosp. for 6 yrs but left 29yrs ago. This was my first return, together with husband and children (13&amp;11) Stayed at hotel for 6 days- a superb,spacious,calm &quot;oasis&quot; in the centre of London. The staff were so friendly,polite,kind and helpful. Children loved the breakfasts,and I was very pleased to see such healthy choices!Such a good,central location. Nearest tube Temple as Blackfriars is closed until ?2011. Only 30 mins from Gatwick to Victoria, and a few mins to Temple on tube. Don't forget to save money by getting OYSTER Cards for travel in London. Hotel is great to walk to Globe &amp; National theatres &amp; Tate Modern over Milleneum Bridge. Also St Paul's &amp; M&amp;S food shop.We did so much,but the list is too long. You can do a family holiday in London for less money, and we all want to come back again from the Scottish Highlands for another holiday of walking,picnic lunches,museums,art galleries,the Wimbledon tour,Globe theatre (5 tickets) a Harrods visit (the pets dept!) and different meals out each evening. Enjoy family time with your teens before they get too old!!! Children want to come back for before Christmas to do it all again! We'll see!"
23,679,"Aug 4 2009 	Breakfasts need some work	Just to confirm this is generally an excellent hotel. However those planning to stay on the 6th floor need to know that breakfast service can be very poor.We stayed for four days and on each of the mornings a big deal was made of setting the table, producing cereal bowls, cutlery etc. Just to clarify we showed up earlier than 9:00 a.m. on each morning (breakfast runs until 9:30 a.m.). A hotel of this quality needs to do better."
24,679,"Aug 2 2009 	Great Location	I think you could not ask for a better location, main London attractions are only at walking distance and you can find Bus Stops and Tube stations just a few meters away from the hotel. Make Charing Cross your station and take the 15 line. The rooms are neat and clean and staff is very helpful. Some rooms in the 7th floor even have a view to the Thames River. I think this the best choice for business travellers."
25,679,"Aug 2 2009 	An excellent hotel in London close to everything you need have stayed before and will stay again!	This was our third stay at this hotel and even after a two year gap since our last stay, we found the hotel to be just as good as it was last time.We got the rooms at a steal, a deluxe room with two double beds for 120/night. We stayed three nights, with the first night on rewards points.The hotel is located in the City of London and is popular with business travellers. It is right across the road from Blackfriars (The underground metro I believe is closed for repairs, but the above ground rail line was still working) and there are many other stations just up the road. At Ludgate Circus there is a bus stop with many routes that will get you to the popular tourist attractions.Reception staff were friendly and efficient, as were housekeeping and concierge. Housekeeping was very quick with delivering any requests.The hotel offers a complimentary morning newspaper to all guests and you can get whatever newspaper you want. You can also pick up an additional one in the lobby if you want, and they didn't have any problems with delivering two if you wanted.There is a Portland convenience store just across the road which is open late into the night, it might possibly be 24-7. Prices there were reasonable. There is also a Starbucks and Costa Coffee within view of the hotel entrance on New Bridge Street. There are some Boots places just up the street where you can get your pharmaceutical goods as well as drinks and snacks.Now onto the rooms, which are beautiful! The rooms are large for London, many hotels don't have rooms which could fit two double beds and still have plenty of room to spare. The hotel has standard, deluxe and exectutive rooms (exec. rooms can't take two double beds for some reason). The TV was an old style one but it had a large screen and plenty of channels including many international ones. Deluxe and Executive rooms have free wired internet, while in the Standard ones you have to pay. Sadly no wi-fi here. There is a business centre which you pay for. The bathrooms were very good with some of the best towels I have had in a luxury hotel. Complimentary tea, coffee, biscuits, small chocolates, mineral and still water is provided and replenished daily.Previous reviewers have commented on the lack of views. The hotel is low rise (presumably building restrictions, same height as all the other buildings on the street) and I don't know what view people would expect in a city block. If you get one of the higher floored rooms you may have a view of St Paul's or a glimpse of the Thames. However, the benefit is that the rooms are nice and quiet.Previous reviewers have also commented on the refurb work in the lobby. I'd just like to point out that this isn't an inconvenience as the lobby previously was just an empty space with a few sofas, but will now be transformed into an area where people can meet and enjoy light meals and drinks. there is definitely no noise coming from the refurb work to the rooms.The only real inconvenience with the refurb is that Spicers is closed. However, Refetorrio is still opened and is serving breakfast in the meantime. We went to Refetorrio for a late dinner. We just had some pasta and a sampler plate as well as wine and it cost 90 for four, not too bad considering it is owned by Georgio Locatelli, who is supposedly michelin-starred. The pasta dishes varied, some of us got small servings which weren't too tasty, while others found it tasty and quite filling. I suppose you just have to be good at choosing!The pub across the road looked good (was busy) but we didn't get to try it. Breakfast is served there until noon and then it is regular food into the night. We went to Chez Gerard in Covent Garden and loved it, I highly recommend. If you would like to have something simple I suggest the Marks &amp; Spencer Simply Food just next to St. Paul's, we all got sandwiches, cakes and drinks, all freshly made for under 20.On one of the night's near Ludgate Circus there was a weirdo who started talking to us. We avoided her and kept walking and she followed for a while until two big dudes came out of the pub and she stopped. I don't see this as a barrier to staying at the hotel, but thought I'd let you know.We are Priority Club Platinum members but there were no real benefits for us, probably because as a group of four we had already booked the best room possible that all of us could sleep in. So perhaps if just one or two people went and booked a deluxe room with a king bed, they might get upgraded to executive.Just a note, getting a taxi on Sundays, especially in the morning, can be difficult. Concierge said that they found it better to go out to New Bridge street and hail a taxi instead of calling because it can take longer if they call. It might be an idea to call reception a few minutes before leaving or checking out to inform them that you require a taxi.The best options to Heathrow or Gatwick are taxi or train. We found the First Capital Connect train from Gatwick very good, as it stopped at Blackfriars and all we had to do to get to the hotel was cross the road!So all in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially at the price we paid. If anyone requires extra information please message me."
26,679,"Jul 30 2009 	Not impressed	Upon our arrival we found out the price was british pounds per night rather than the US dollars that we were quoted by ITC Hotels Group. The desk was able to find us another room at a different hotel in the chain but not for the following 2 nights. We stayed two nights at the Crowne Plaza and for the price we paid (195 bp), we would definitely NOT say this hotel was a good deal. We had the larger &quot;club&quot; or executive room with free drinks and canapes in a club lounge. We probably could have gotten our money out of the stay if we drank heavily, but we don't. The bar that you hang your clothes on in the closet in our room collapsed as soon as we hung our clothes on it. The room may have bigger by London standards but it wasn't large by our standards. The rate included a full english breakfast buffet on weekends. The breakfast was less than satisfactory as they constantly ran out of various items. Not to mention that breakfast was served in a conference hall rather than a restaurant. Travel to and from the hotel was also difficult because of construction and the Blackfriars Tube stop being closed. We did not think this part of London was good for a family or sightseeing. The staff was marginally helpful at best with the exception of the desk manager who tried his best to accommodate our requests when we arrived. In the end we were switched to a much less expensive hotel, The Holiday Inn Express in Bloomsbury, which had a much better room for substaintially less, in a better part of London, with a better breakfast and much friendlier staff. Overall, I can't complain too much because we only stayed at the Crowne Plaza 2 nights and we stayed at the Bloomsbury Holiday Inn 7 nights. Who would have thought a Holiday Inn would be that much better than a Crowne Plaza, but it was, trust me."
27,679,"Jul 29 2009 	Was UNAWARE of hotel renovations taking place!!	I arrived at the hotel with my partner last weekend for a birthday weekend treat to half a hotel reception, half is 'boarded off' for refurbishment. I would not have minded half as much if i had been informed about the hotel renovations when booking the hotel online and speaking to someone on the telephone to confirm a 'room with a view'..The view was 'Blackfriars' train station (which is also going through major refurb and is a building site). The room itself was a very nice size, and one of the biggest hotel rooms ive stayed in, when in a london hotel..Unfortunatley due to hotel fefurb the hotel's restaurant was not fully up and running..The hotel does have a small gym, but my room card would not let me enter the gym (dont know why)..? The hotel does have a nice bar which offers a range of cocktails..overall i would stay again, just after the refurb!!"
28,679,"Jul 18 2009 	Ok hotel.	We redeemed our Priority Club points to get this hotel free. The hotel is located within a short tube ride of any attraction. It is very close to St. Paul's Cathedral and the Thames. We also walked to Big Ben from here. The tube station right outside the station is closed for renevation (Blackfriars), but there are several other stations within a short walking distance. The lobby was under renevation when we were there, it will probably be nice when it is completed. There was more construction outside our window, but it did not distract us from sleeping. The only major issue was that the celling was leaking the day we left. Overall, it was an ok hotel. It will probably be better when the lobby is completed and when the tube station renovation and the outside construction is completed (though this is beyond the hotel's control)."
29,679,"Jul 14 2009 	Comfortable good hotel and value but don't expect to be dazzled	My wife and I stayed at Crown Plaza The City for 6 nights in early July. IMPORTANT NOTE: Blackfriar station is closed until 2011 for renovations, you must use Mansion House or Temple (preferred) tube stations. The staff was friendly and professional but we didn't often see or speak to anyone the 6 nights we were there. After checking in, there was hammering coming from below (there is some construction going on in the hotel), but the front desk quickly moved us to another where it was honestly one of the most quiet hotel stays I've had. &quot;The City&quot; (name of the neighborhood, old London) is close to other places but is fairly bland in some ways and is kind of deserted on the weekend. Overall a good experience, comfortable and a good value but don't expect to be dazzled."
30,679,"Jul 11 2009 	A hotel that gets everything right.	I have stayed at some of the best known hotels and resorts in the world but they could all learn something from this hotel. From arrival to departure these guys got it absolutely right. As is often the case it was the small things that made the difference. Reception staff who are warm, friendly and efficent without being obsequious or(as is often the case)indifferent. They were actually training new staff on the reception procedure as we checked in but there was no delay, no fuss, no awkward silences. The staff talk to you as they tap away on their keyboards so if there is even a slight delay you never feel you are being patronised. The restaurant and bar facilities, along with the staff, are first class. No matter what time of day or night the quality of service never falls below excellent. I have never stayed in this hotel before but its the first place I would stay whenever I am in London. And, for any cynics reading this review, I do not work for this company. I just happened to have found a hotel company that treats its guests as people, not cash machines. WELL DONE CROWNE PLAZA LONDON!"
31,679,"Jul 9 2009 	Lovely London hotel - central with great staff	We stayed here for two nights around our wedding. The staff at the hotel were fantastic and bought us champagne into the room as well as chocolates in the evening. The rooms are spacious and they upgraded my family for free as well which was really kind. The hotel is very modern with lovely bathrooms and it is spacious for London.The location is great, near to the river, Temple tube station and the central sights. The restaurant in the hotel is also fabulous and we had a great evening meal there which i would recommend. The bar is excellent too and has good cocktails and a DJ at the weekend."
32,679,"Jul 7 2009 	Fantastic Hotel great location lovely staff	I would highly recommend this hotel. My sister and I stayed here because we got a good rate and after reading the excellent reviews on here.The hotel is easy to find and just a 5/10 minute walk along the embankment from Temple tube station. The hotel will be even more accessable as soon as Blackfriers tube re-opens. The staff were very friendly and helpful and check in was done in minutes. Our room was on the first floor and we'd noticed some roadworks outside the hotel on our way in and were worried we'd be disturbed but the sound proofing is amazing! Ive never stayed in such a quiet hotel room in my life. The room was a good size, modern and spotlessly clean. There were 'White Company' toiletries in the bathroom and a plentiful supply of clean white towels. My sister and I went to see Take That later that evening at Wembley Stadium and were glad to know we were only a few tube stops away from our super comfy bed after an evening of singing and dancing!The next day we walked to covent garden from the hotel which only took us about 20 minutes strolling along with a coffee. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend this hotel or to stay here again and infact im sure I will everytime I visit London."
33,679,"Jun 30 2009 	Was good hotel for very good price	This hotel is located on the north side of the City (financial district). Location was good for easy access to Tower of London and Tower Bridge. It is about 8 blocks north of the Tube station. There are a number of buses that go by both the Crown Plaza and Tube station. Tube is excellent for getting around London central. If you are going to be out each day, get the day pass/ticket. Crown Plaza (City) seems to be business oriented. That was fine as we were in town over the weekend. It was a good stay for the price paid."
34,679,"Jun 27 2009 	Excellent!	This hotel is inviting, elegant and the services are first class. The staff was polite and accomodating. The rooms are clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. The hotel is close to the tub/metro and the busline. Only negative, no restaurants within walking distance that are open for dinner. I highly recommend this hotel!"
35,679,"Jun 27 2009 	Fantastic can't fault it at all yet again!!!	We've lost count on the number of times we have stayed at Crowne Plaza, The City, and once again we were not disappointed. We stayed here twice in the space of a week, backing onto our holiday in Croatia. On arrival on the first stay we were lucky enough to get an early check in and an upgrade to a Club Room, we were also upgraded again on our following stay.The rooms are clean and tidy with a nice modern decor. Air-conditioned (although they could do with dimming the light on the air-conditioner as I had to put tape over it during the night as the little green light is just way too bright!), with all the usual mod-cons. Great addition was the plunger coffee, biscuits and chocolates in the room. Always a nice touch.Something exceptional this stay was the staff honesty and hotel security. We were completely in holiday mode and on our first stay left all our foreign curency in the safe (which we left open), value of 350. Once we got to the airport the following day, as we stayed the night at Gatwick for an early flight, we promptly called the hotel in the hope that they may have found it. Obviously unable to provide an answer immediately, we had to board the plane and wait and see thinking our 350 was lost, so the holiday was going to be double the cost! Very pleased on arrival of our flight to pick up our messages with the good news that 'yes' ALL the money had been located and was stored securely in the main safe for our return the following weekend, very efficiently providing a reference number for collection. What a saviour!Could highly recommend this hotel, it is only a 10-15 minute walk to Covent Garden. The service is always exceptional and we always have a great stay.We didn't dine in the restaurant, but could highly recommend a nice local Malaysian restuarant called '54' which is on Farringdon Road (yes you guessed it, No 54.) for dinner."
36,679,"Jun 23 2009 	Great modern spacious hotel	Stayed here whilst travelling to London for the night and couldnt have been happier.Firstly, the hotel is perfectly positioned for anyone using First Capital Connect trains (Luton airport, bedford, brighton etc) as the train station for gettting on them (city thameslink) is located &lt;200m away. So we had a nice easy travel to the hotel which was brilliant. The tube station that the hotel is right next to (Blackfriars) is closed for renovations currently till 2011 however Temple statino is a short and lovely walk away along teh thames so not too many complaints there. Location was great for walking to west end theatre, buckingham palace, big ben &amp; st pauls so near all the sights. Quiet hotel.Service was excellent - the conceirge especially was sooo helpful with our requests and really went the extra mile to help us find a restaurant.We received an upgrade to a club room which was brilliant - the rooms were spacius, modern and had all the mod cons - including an ipod dock so we could just slot in our ipod and have music playing. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was great. Rare to find a modern hotel with large rooms in london and i would strongly recommend staying here."
37,679,"Jun 23 2009 	Dreary hotel in the wrong part of town	Afraid it looks like I am going to be the dissenting voice amongst these reviews. I was bitterly disappointed by this hotel. Set in a dead part of London, down a dreary back street, it's only redeeming feature was its staff who were efficient and friendly throughout the hotel. The Club level rooms were probably the worst of any Crowne Plaza I have stayed in, poky, dark, dreary, cluttered with outdated furnishings and beds that are adequate at best. I dread to think what a standard room is like. After several miserable stays in the group's hotels lately, this is the hotel that, after seven years as a Platinum Priority Club member has tipped me over the edge with the group's declining quality in all it's UK locations and take my business to Marriott. If you get a cheap deal, stay here. If you are paying full rate there are better located and higher quality hotels to me had for your money in London.By the way, no mentipn of it on the hotel's website but Blackfriars tube station across the road from the hotel is closed until 2011 making it's remote location even more of an issue"
38,679,"Jun 12 2009 	nice location	Big rooms, nice breakfast, but parking difficult, and difficult to reach with workts"
39,679,May 27 2009 	A Top class hotel with outstanding staff!!!	My husband and i recently stayed at The City hotel and i can honestly say It was one of the best hotels we have stayed at!! We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and the hotel upgraded us free of charge and then sent Chocolates and a hand written anniversary card to our room!!!! That was such a lovely gesture!! The hotel was spotless and very modern and ALL of the staff were so so friendly!! I would 100% go back to stay there and recomend it to anyone!!!
40,679,"May 19 2009 	Wouldn't stay anywhere else...	We had stayed at the Crowne Plaza a couple of years ago and were knocked out by the service, comfort and cleanliness. Since then, we have stayed at several other more fashionable London hotels but this time we decided to follow our head rather than our designer-label heart and return for a three-day stay to celebrate my partner's birthday.From the moment we were greeted by Carlo at the check-in desk, one of the so many helpful members of staff that combine to make you feel really valued, we experienced a near-perfect long week-end (the only thing we could gripe about was the weather!).The hotel is modern, spotlessly clean, spacious and so perfectly located. Our room (a deluxe double) was perfect, with a super bed, sitting area and bathroom.It was also so quiet, which meant that we got a really good sleep and lie-in on each of the three days of our stay.From the hotel we were just a 20 minute walk away from Covent Garden, the South Bank, Borough Market, St Pauls..... I could go on. And if we had wanted to use public transport, there are bus stops and an underground station right outside.I simply cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. It might be a little on the pricey side, bur rest assured - you won't get better all round value than at the London City Crowne Plaza."
41,679,"May 12 2009 	Fantastic hotel loved it!	We booked this hotel as it was in close proximity to the Royal Festival Hall where we had booked to see a show. Originally we had declined breakfast as this worked out at 15pppn but at check in, for an extra 20 a night we were offered a huge upgraded room with fantastic views of the eye, breakfast in the execitive lounge, afternoon tea in the executive lounge, free alcoholic drinks between 6pm and 8pm and a free newspaper delivered to our room in the morning - a bargin we couldn't refuse! Would definately stay here again."
42,679,"May 6 2009 	A little pricey but Rooms were very cool.	We were first put in a room that smelled of smoke, but I went downstairs and as soon as I mentioned it we were quickly UPGRADED and moved to a much better room. The hotel is well suited for business and leisure travelers alike. Loved the close access (literally steps) to the underground and some of the citys most famous sites. Finally the rooms were nicely decorated in a contemporary fashion and even had a clock/speakers to plug my iphone into (great for an American without an electrical adapter.)"
43,679,"May 5 2009 	By far the best London hotel i have ever stayed in	Me and my partner were staying in the hotel for my birthday as we booked a package deal to see Dirty Dancing, we have been on alot of package deals in london to see shows and concerts and although the shows are brilliant the hotels are always ok but not great. I had heard people mention the Crowne Plaza, so thought we would stay there, I was Immediately pleased not just by how lovely the hotel looked but by the service i recieved, the receptionist who dealt with us in check in was exstreamly polite and very friendly, she informed us of all infomation we needed to know and got us checked in in no time at all.When we got up to our room,it was amazing the room was perfect,it had everything you could possiblely need, from internet to an ipod docking station. The room was spoltless it was so clean and tidy.After a great night sleep,we made our way down to breakfast and the excellent service just kept coming, the food was delicious.This was by far the best london hotel i have ever stayed in, i enjoyed my stay so much am in the process of booking another package deal later this year with my family.Best birthday present ever!!!!!!!!!"
44,679,"May 2 2009 	Location + Spotless = Great Hotel	We stayed for 4 nights and our room was a standard--which was roomy enough for the two of us. We had a view room over the street, much better than having to look into the &quot;courtyard&quot; that some rooms have.The room was spotless and the maid we had was fantastic. I used the internet in the business center everyday and it was free.There is a shop directly across the street which is open 24/7, a Costa Coffee one block away, and the awesome Blackfriar Pub across the street.You must use your room card key to use the elevator which is a nice security feature I wish more hotels had although the lifts are painfully slow.Bed was too soft for the husband and a bit squishy for me, but really a minor complaint. I wouldn't want to stay in the heat of summer as the A/C in our room was anemic in its ability to cool the room.I would stay here again without hesitation, we walked everywhere (Big Ben, Imperial War Museum, Cabinet War rooms, etc.) although not everyone is as avid a walker as we are."
45,679,"Apr 30 2009 	I would definately stay there again	I suppose under stated on the out side, but once inside its actually awsome when you enter the reception, its huge and very impressive.The staff are tremendous, the hotel itself is superb in every respect,standard, location, very high quality every where.You can also leave your luggage ther almost all day if you are leaving london in the evening.Nice bar below to chill after a night out in the West end. all in all a very chilled out weekend. I would certainly look at other Crown Plaza hotels in the future where ever I go."
46,679,"Apr 27 2009 	Enjoyable stay	The hotel is located in a great location, only a short walk to the Tate Modern, Millennium Bridge etc. There is a lot of construction around Blackfriars tube (until late 2011) so it can be a little confusing initially finding the hotel.The rooms were well appointed and modern and they were cleaned well, albeit it quite late (about 5pm) each day. Perhaps the hotel was short staffed but it wasn't a big issue. Most of the staff were helpful except for a grumpy receptionist upon check-in but the rest were quite polite. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to 'Temple' tube station and there are a couple of pubs in the area. All in all the hotel was sufficient for the needs of a tourist / business person."
47,679,"Apr 27 2009 	Great hotel great location	Really lovely modern hotel. We had a standard room, which had everything you would need.The bathroom was a good size, with bath and shower. The room was a good size and the bed was amazingly comfortable!The hotel's location is good. It is literally opposite Blackfriars tube station. However, when we stayed Blackfriars was closed so we had to use Temple. This was only a 5 minute walk so not too bad, but will be better when Blackfriars re-opens.We did not use any of the restaurants or bar as we only stayed one night so cannot comment on these, but I would imagine they are of high standard.All in all a great hotel."
48,679,"Apr 26 2009 	Overnight stay	I have stayed in the hotel a few times as it was close to work. As i have used the IHG hotels alot, and a priorty gold member i was automatically upgraded to a club room, which was fantastic. Wonderful bedroom, bathroom - very roomy.The staff were warm and friendly. Highly recommended"
49,679,"Apr 20 2009 	Very good option!	Crowne Plaza London City, was everything that we wanted. Rooms were very modern, clean and well equiped. The service of the Lounge was excellent; free drinks and snacks during evenings. The receptionist was very friendly and we get very good service everytime we went to ask something. Buffet breakfast was also very good. Only inconvenience was that our keaycard stopped working many times. Anyhow, very good place to stay if you value good quality!"
50,679,Apr 13 2009 	Does What It Says On The Tin	Clean and pleasant hotel away from the hustle of central London but still well placed for access to all the attractions and the river. Good value if you can get the room only 2 for 1 offers available (especially at weekends). Closure of the adjoining tube station is a minor inconvenience - short and nice walk to St Pauls helps wake you up in the morning.Not a hotel if you want glamour (geared towards weekday City business trade) but I would certainly recommend it. Staff are friendly and helpful.
51,679,"Mar 31 2009 	Won't frighten the horses!	This is a solid, cookie-cutter hotel from the InterContinental chain. The location is great, offering a bit of piece and quiet from the madness of the West End, but within easy walking distance of theatres, restaurants and shops. It's true that having Blackfriars tube station out of action for a couple of years is a bit inconvenient, but both St Pauls and Temple stations are within an easy 10 minute walk.The hotel itself is very contemporary and is well designed. Staff at reception and in the restaurant were very pleasant and welcoming. The rooms are rather bland, cream walls with pale wood, but are of a decent size. It feels like the rooms could do with a soft refurb, lick of paint, deep clean of the carpets and bathrooms. The rooms aren't in poor condition but with such a modern hotel in the City you'd hope they'd try and keep standards as high as possible. One of the plus points for me, and why I've returned a number of times is because of the excellent sound-proofing. The door to the bedoom is heavy and solid and you very rarely hear any corridor noise, I've certainly never been disturbed here. Air conditioning is effective, though sometimes it's nice just to open a window and you can't at this hotel.We've always stayed at the Crowne Plaza on an offer, this time it was a two for one deal which meant the room rate was approximately 60 per night and represented excellent value for money. Breakfast wasn't included and we paid for that separately. 22.50 for breakfast is steep, and adding a service charge to a self-service buffet is incredibly cheeky! We only ate there as I had a voucher for a free breakfast, I wouldn't recommend shelling out that money if you're having to pay, there are plenty of cafe's nearby, and even a McDonald's on Fleet Street!A top tip if you're driving is that the roads around the hotel offer free parking from Saturday at 1.30pm to Monday at 8.30am. A complete bargain when you consider how much 24 hour parking can be in central London.In summary, a hotel that probably won't have your heart racing, but offers excellent value for money for a weekend trip to London."
52,679,Mar 23 2009 	Great place to stay with a baby	We stayed one night with our 23 month old daughter and 4 month old baby. We had a standard room which was very spacious. A travel cot was provided free of charge with lovely Winnie-the-Pooh duvet and Pillow which our daughter loved. We had our own pop-up bassinet for the baby and the room had plenty of space for us to put up this as well as the travel cot.A nice touch was the complementary bottles of water - not all hotels seem to do this these days.The room and bathroom were clean and I liked that a room key is required to access the lift to the rooms.I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
53,679,"Mar 20 2009 	superb customer service	Booked a weekend in London for my Dads 60th birthday.Upon emailing the hotel the night before to let the hotel know it was his birthday, his room was upgraded and a card and a gift were presented from the hotel staff.He said the hotel was in a great location and had a fantastic weekend at the crowne plaza London City.Thanks to all the staff for making his weekend extra special."
54,679,"Mar 18 2009 	Great	Arrived for one night on Valentines Day and, very fortunately, was able to check in at 10am. Room was clean and modern with just a little street noise due to 1st floor location. Staff were very courteous. Right next door to Blackfriars underground (but I believe the station is now closed for several months for modernisation so you may need to check alternative stations). The hotel had a problem with their water heating system during my stay and were professional enough to put a letter under the door to explain the problem and apologise for any inconvenience. Would stay again."
55,679,"Mar 14 2009 	Would stay here again - great location.	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza in the City on Friday 13th March 2009 following a work event. Check in was very easy and informative  we were into the room in under five minutes. We paid 90 for an advance purchase rate standard room direct from the hotels website.The room was a good size, with two double beds and plenty of space for luggage and clothes. The room was clean, the bathroom sparkling and both were well maintained. We had an inside room which still let in plenty of light from the atrium, however we were on the fifth floor so suspect that lower floors may be quite dark.The location of the hotel is fantastic, especially if you want to be close to St Pauls Cathedral and the surrounding area (although the closure of Blackfriars Station opposite the hotel until sometime in 2011 is unfortunate) and at the weekend it is lovely and quiet. It is only a five minute stroll to the bus stop and a 5-10 minute ride to the heart of the West End. Buses 15 and 23 will take you along the Strand and straight to Piccadilly Circus/Regent Street/Oxford Street West.We recommend this hotel if you are looking for a good standard, corporate style, located in this area of London for a reasonable price. We didnt use the restaurants or leisure facilities available so cannot comment on these.Liked: Location, room, cleanliness and lack of hassle.Disliked: The firmness of the mattress may not be to everyones preference, minor cosmetic damage to lamp and stereo."
56,679,Mar 11 2009 	Enjoyable Stay	The Crowne Plaza The City is a well located smart modern hotel.The checkin was fast and efficient and a nice touch was to be shown to our room by the receptionist.The room itself was a good size and clean with everything we needed.Even though the hotel is located on a busy road there was very little outside noise and overall the room was very quite.A bonus is access to the exective lounge with complementry coffee etc and good views.Even with the closure of the tube station near the hotel transport is not a problem as St Pauls tube is only 10 minutes away and there are plenty of bars etc near the hotel.
57,679,"Mar 3 2009	Great Location comfortable relaxing	My 18 year old grand-daughter and I stayed for three days at the Crowne Plaza--I wanted her to see St. Paul's Cathedral, the Tower of London, the Globe, and take a boat ride on the Thames--even in super cold weather. The great location allowed us to walk everywhere. The hotel was comfortable and modern--quiet, with great beds. Maybe not a great view--at least from our room--but on the other hand, once we were on Fleet street we were near some of the greatest sights in the world. I also liked the restaurant, which was relaxing and serving good food. Be sure to go to the Blackfriars Pub right across the street. My granddaughter loved the publ. The staff was helpful, courteous, and I would say, went beyond the call of duty--like the concierge gave us a pass to St Paul's--which we did return, by the way, so someone else could use it. I would stay here again, in a minute."
58,679,"Mar 1 2009 	A quiet relaxing place in the city	The location when Blackfriars is open is ideal as the station is right outside the hotel and there's a direct line to the museums in South Kensington. As it was, we had to walk either to Waterloo or Embankment (~30 minutes) to get on the underground.Despite the hotel being on a busy road, with plenty of roadworks, our room was virtually silent. We requested an inner-facing room which although lacks a view (you're not missing much anyway), guaranteed a peaceful night. The two double bed's were quite small but useful if you have family and the room was a very good size. The room and bathroom were spotless and had everything you could need including dressing gowns which was a nice touch in a standard rooms.Service both on reception, concierge, and the bar were all top notch. The bar does add an optional service charge which unfortunately seems to be the standard in London these days, not something us Northerners are used to! But the bar was nice...really trendy, a good cocktail menu, and a decent enough DJ. Great for a pre-dinner drink.There's apparently a jacuzzi and sauna in the leisure centre but we didn't get to try this.My only complaint is the exorbitant cost of the in-room services. A day's use of the internet/movies/music was 45 and 11 for a single movie. Being able to rent music through your TV was a quite novel idea though. The mini bar was also excessively marked up with a small bag of crisps costing 2.75!The breakfast is also a shocking 22.50. Try the Young Vic in-between Southwark and Waterloo stations - 6.50 for great eggs Florentine. Also Babylon at Rooftop Gardens in Kensington is great for a sophisticated lunch with a view (18-21).I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying there on our next trip to the city."
59,679,"Mar 1 2009 	The most helpful staff we have come across	We arrived at 10am to be told that we could move into our room imediately by an extremely helpful receptionist. Our standard room was clean, bright modern. The drinks in the bar were on the expensive side but the bar staff were extremely attentive and the atmosphere in the bar relaxed and friendly. On leaving we left our cases with the concierge for the day. After finaly leaving the hotel at 5pm we found that that the underground was shut for repair, unable to hail a taxi we returned to the hotel and despit having officialy checked out at 12 noon the hotel called us a taxi. Thank you very much, we made our flight check in with 5 mins to spare."
60,679,"Feb 27 2009 	What a Marvelous Hotel with Wonderful Staff	We took our 7 year old Grandson for his first trip to London, for a week trip, over the February half term. We booked with the Hilton Hotel Groups booking service using their talk to me messaging service, on their web site, after asking what the best deals were for central London, at the best price for 2 nights stay. This booking service was great and allowed us to check out reviews of the hotels that they recommended, by looking them up on Trip Advisor. We got a stunning deal of 2 nights for the price of one in a spacious Club room that had 2 double beds - a luxury room at an incredible rate (cheaper than staying at a Travel Lodge!). From the moment we arrived to the time we left we were treated as though we were really special. Our grandson was over the the moon with how helpful the porter was as we entered the hotel and said - &quot;wow it's just like like being royalty with your own servants&quot;. He availed himself, a couple of times, to calling room service to get extra biscuits, tea and milk and we have to say that all the staff were faultless on every occasion we need to call on them. Planning visits or getting tickets to places was a dream because the concierge let us use the Internet PC's in the business centre - if they were not able to do direct bookings themselves.We didn't bother with breakfast at the hotel as it was an extra 22 per person for English - which to be honest was not at all a good deal. But as we new this when we booked, we were not all bothered about this. There were loads of good eateries just around the corner in Fleet Street and even by St Paul's Cathedral, which were less than a five minute walk away. You could have a full English for less than 6 and a lovely Continental breakfast, for some what less. On the Sunday morning we had breakfast at Paul's Bakery, next to the Cathedral for 17 all in, for the 3 of us and it was delightful, with home made breads filled with fine ingredients. Oddly, though, you could get a 2 course evening meal at the Hotel's posh restaurant for less than 11 per person - although we didn't get a chance to try this out and verify the standard it looked good.If you want to grab an excellent pint of beer and have a really good taste of English food, then soak up the atmosphere at the Old Cheshire Cheese on Fleet Street - it's a must do experience and the open fires were great to huddle around, on the first night when it was a little chilly outside. The Blackfriars Pub directly opposite the hotel is also a cosy bolt hole with good beer and unbelievably reasonably priced, very quaffable house wine. Plus it has a stunning evening view of the London Eye and the OXO Tower, which shine out brightly across the Thames Embankment, if you sit at the outside tables!BUT what really made the week end GREAT was the stay at the hotel itself - pampered luxury at a knock down price in a very, very pleasant area of the city. We can't wait to go again!"
61,679,"Feb 27 2009 	Reasonable 	Reception &amp; checkout very friendly &amp; efficient. Concierge knowledgeable &amp; very friendly.Stayed 2 nights in king size club room. Room OK but number of cosmetic problems that did no justice to the premium rate charged e.g eye catching scratches on table in dining area (strange because the table surface had a glass top protective cover) and some furniture surfaces looking tired and dull. If you think the inclusive continental breakfast in the club lounge an attraction..think again. On the weekend we were there it conisted of two croissants and half a dozen mini danish pastries....that's it ! apart from automated machine serving beverages. Two other couples walked in while we were there, saw the display &amp; walked out again in disgust. The evening was bettter with a good choice of beer, wine, spirits &amp; canapesThese little disappointments apart, the hotel is well located near tubes and attractions, clean and tidy and worth the money provided you get a good deal."
62,679,"Feb 23 2009 	Close to city	stayed at this hotel for two nights using points from Holiday Inn but have stayed at better quality Holiday Inns - expected Crowne Plaza to be better.nice hotel with good facilities including gym. Wifi 5 per hour and room service available.Bar prices extortionate not to mention the optional 10% service charge added to everything.beds were comfy and room really nice.local tube station is Blackfriars - PLEASE NOTE THIS TUBE STATION CLOSES ON 2ND MARCH 2009 FOR 2 YEARS - next nearest tube is 12 mins walk away.would recommend the City Inn, Westminster to a friend first"
63,679,"Feb 22 2009 	What a Great Hotel	Having searched through a whole host of reviews and hotlels for a theatre weekend.I went for this one what a great hotel. Clean customer service superb. The staff could not do enough for you.A nice touch having to use your room key for the lift for extra security.I did'nt fancy the restaurant for evening meal, but as a previous reviewer said the Blackfriar acorss the road is a great London pub with good food.The only down side for future travellers, the tube next to the hotel is closed from 2/3/09for 18 months!!However the 63 bus from Kings Cross to the hotel is a regular service for 2.00 each"
64,679,"Feb 17 2009 	Valentines Day in London	Looking through the reviews the most common thread is the friendliness of the staff and I would not disagree. We arrived too early for a room but we were helped with our luggage and promised the room would be ready later. When we returned the reception was fast and friendly and the porter very helpful. The room on the 7th floor was an odd shape but very comfortable with small but adequate bathroom and a coffee percolator. We were going out for a meal but the Spicers restaurant was open and we tried the Valentine Menu which was fantastic, although it was a bit quiet. Unfortunately the hotel boiler went down about 7pm which meant we missed out on a shower and got a bit cold but the hotel response was quick and apologetic. Also the friendliest hotel engineer ever! The hotel is a great location for St Pauls and the South Bank but not quite as easy to get into town, especially when the Tube Station is shut in March. We had breakfast at the Tate Modern - healthy but the most miserable waiters in town."
65,679,"Jan 5 2009 	till next time	Just got back. Saw the fireworks at new years day. Great !!Second time we booked this hotel and i think we book it again next time. Again we made a good deal for 4 nights.Besides that it is a very comfortable hotel. The location is very good if you gonna take the subway, its also 20 minutes walking to the London Eye. Its very near the river Thames but dont expect nice views from your room. The standard rooms are comfortable with one or two (very nice) beds. Just the bathroom is on the small size. We liked the rooms very much, its well isolated (from the inside as well) and our room had a glimp of the street. The people working at the hotel are very friendly and helpfull.We had also breakfast including the deal, which was also very good. Yes, we come back next time. We liked it !"
66,679,"Jan 1 2009 	Quality hotel with excellent location.	My wife and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza City from 29 Dec 08 to 1 Jan 2009. I got a good deal through the Travel Republic web-site, bed and full buffet breakfast for less than 100 per night. Reception staff were very efficient and helpful and all aspects of my booking were dealt with smoothly. The Reception area is large and modern with a roaring gas fire to beat the very cold weather.We were given a complimentary upgrade and the corner room on floor 5 was clean, spacious and very well equipped.Breakfast was adequate for a 4 star hotel and the staff were very friendly and accommodating.My only complaint was with the Concierge service who failed to inform me of any of the New's Years Eve arrangements in the Hotel. I had asked on the 30th December what was available and was told that apart from the 115 per head Gala Function in the Italian Restaurant there was nothing else. I therefore booked a meal in a nearby restaurant. I was then surprised to find an information sheet pushed under our room door late on New's Eve telling me of an alternative 55 per head meal in Spicer's Restaurant, a function with food in the Bar and a discoin the Lobby! Had I known I would have booked a table in Spicer's Restaurant.However, we were able to partake of the disco and our meal at Cafe Rouge was somewhat cheaper.The pub over the road - The Black Friar is of historic interest, very popular and atmospheric, serves proper pub grub at cheap prices and a selection of real ales. Not to be missed.The location of the hotel is helped enormously by the proximity of Blackfriars tube on the District and Circle lines. When it closes for refurbishment for 3 years in March 2009 this will remove this benefit, making the hotel much more difficult to access by tube.Overall a great hotel for the price paid with excellent staff."
67,679,"Dec 9 2008	Clean quiet but the view?	The Crowne Plaza City is easily accessible from the Blackfriars tube station (exit 8 I think), and there are two entrances to this hotel, but both take you to reception, whether you decide to enter the hotel via either way. The reception is very large open plan, wonderful comfy couches, huge gas fire, and a very beautiful silver clock. Receptionists were efficient, gave me two card keys without me having to ask, and we were directed to our room. Now here comes the fun bit.The hotel had agreed to upgrade us to a better room than we had originally booked (this is the first time in 5 years of staying with the ICH group of hotels I hasten to add!), and whilst the room was nice and cosy (see pics), the view was indescribably bad! I immediately closed the curtains and left them closed all weekend. You must see the pics to understand what I mean. This was room 609, there were also other rooms facing this white facade. I would have thought that a hotel of this calibre would at least try to make a boring view a little more interesting for its paying guests, but hey!The hotel, whilst busy, appeared quiet. The Crowne plazas must do something to fire doors/room doors/lift doors, to make them extra quiet, and I like this feature of the hotel. Why holiday inns aren't as quiet, I will never know!There were at least two chairs to relax in the bedroom, and the room had a very comfy bed/tea/coffee making facilities to make you feel at home. The furniture showed a little sign of wear and tear (the hanger in the wardrobe fell off as I placed a blouse in it!), but good quality fittings throughout.The shower had good pressure, and the bath water also filled the bath quick enough.We ate at the restaurant on a saturday night. We were on the fixed price menu (included in our 150 per night stay), and I was really disappointed with my two first courses. I had smoked mozzarella and beetroot salad. I felt as though the quality was of that which you could have prepared yourself with ingredients from tesco. The main course (veggie), was bland, uninspiring and whilst there was plenty, I was so bored I left half of my main course. The dessert was excellent, and service was OK. Why when there were only 4 tables eating they seated them all next to each other, to hear each others conversation, I can only guess that they didn't want far to walk to serve diners.Breakfast was great, plenty of food, great staff (especially sunday morning), and nothing too much trouble.I suppose I expected more, so I am disappointed. If you want a room with a view, suggest you contact the hotel directly to ensure you get it.The Blackfriar pub across the road from the hotel is a must go to - just a great little pub, serving food and a great selection of beers and wines in the middle of london."
68,679,Dec 6 2008 	Nice Hotel	Crowne Plaza-The City is a nice hotel located very close to the Black Friar tube station and just across the street from the Black Friar Pub-A very old pub that we enjoyed very much. It is just north of Victoria Embankment. The room was adequate with a good size bathroom. It was clean. Crown Plaza' have comfortable beds/pillows with decent sheets and covers. One evening My wife and I got stuck in the elevator for about 30-minutes. The door would not open and they had to call the fire department to help. The manager was very sorry and paid for our dinner in the Italian restaurant located in the hotel. The food was good and we appreciated the consideration. I booked this hotel for a Friday and Saturday night through United.com... paid $150/night with tax. The same room goes for $400ish starting on Sunday since there main business is serving business district customers.
69,679,"Nov 30 2008 	Best London hotel to date	Chose this Crowne Plaza for a weekend culture break in London on the basis of tripadvisor reviews and was very pleased with the choice. The location is appealing since you can easily walk to the West End theatres, South bank galleries, the Barbican, etc. It may be a good 15-20 minute walk in some cases, but London is such a pleasant place to stroll around, weather notwithstanding, with its countless hidden laneways and curiosities, so why wouldn't you? This was the first trip to London (of several) where I've managed to avoid the Tube entirely. Taking the tube to many of these destinations will take longer than walking in any case. And the hotel will gladly loan you an umbrella if necessary.I had a standard room which was a decent size for London, and furnished pleasantly. I've paid considerably more in years gone by for considerably less. Even though I was only on the first floor, overlooking busy New Bridge St, road noise was not an issue for me. Complimentary mineral water was provided, and it was replaced each day! The only minor annoyance concerning the room related to the power outlets. The only ones in the bathroom were part of the hair-dryer fitting and only offered non-earthed 2-pin US or European fittings. All my adaptor plugs had earth pins, and wouldn't fit. So I had to use my electric shaver over the desk in the bedroom. (I'm sure the hotel would have obliged with an adaptor if I had asked.) The only other minor glitch was that when I left, the hotel called a private car instead of the taxi I asked for, which cost approx 30%-40% more. I never tried the hotel's own restaurant or food options, given their relatively high price. There are any number of Pret's, Starbucks, Cafe Costa's, and the like a short stroll from the hotel where you can fill up, maybe not as well, but for a good deal less money. Although most of the nearby outlets are closed on the weekend, St.Paul's is just around the corner, and most of the food outlets adjacent to it are open on weekends. Also, just a short stroll to Ludgate Circus is the appealing &quot;Leon&quot;, which serves a good variety of &quot;healthy fast-food&quot; at very reasonable prices. Would happily stay here again for a similar style of visit."
70,679,"Nov 25 2008 	Liked the room the location and the price.	Stayed here for two nights in a club junior suite earlier this year. The room was very nice and the staffs were friendly and accommodating. There was a problem with service in the club lounge on Sunday evening. But my complaint was handled very professional and friendly. I was invited to talk to the guest relations manager and she asked if she could do anything for us. My request for a late check out was honoured immediately. Not always so simple on a week day. Best of all, that evening service at the lounge was impeccable.I like a hotel where I feel they take customer suggestions seriously and really try and improve wherever possible.Although there isnt much going on right around the hotel, it is sort of in the middle of all the major attractions. So you can get everywhere easily using public transport.Breakfast was good, but very English. Not necessarily everyones cup of tea, but I liked it.All in all, a very nice stay."
71,679,Nov 11 2008 	Comfortable stay	This hotel is in a brilliant location with a tube station right next to it. I have stayed in loads of London hotels and this one is the only one than really stands out. Rooms are big and comfortable for London. Staff was very friendly and helpfull and I was well pleased with them. Prices was good for the hotel not rip off.
72,679,"Nov 11 2008	Not up to crown plaza standards	I feel i got too llttle for what i expected. Cheaply done, with lotsof trainees as employees everywhere and little other service. Not recommended"
73,679,"Nov 11 2008	most comfortable/Crown Plaza London	My wife and I had a great stay at the Crowne Plaza, London this October. Very clean, comfortable room. comfortable bed and linens,towels very absorbent. Large Room.. Good bath and shower. Staff was always helpful. Breakfast buffet was good. All in all we would book there again if we can get back to London. Especially, contrasted with a much larger hotel in Paris which was next on our trip this hotel is outstanding."
74,679,"Nov 5 2008 	Fantastic customer service at this Crowne Plaza	Have stayed at a number of Crowne Plazas, but this one really does stand out. Excellent customer service - really felt valued as a customer right from the moment I walked in the door.The receptionist even showed me around the hotel.Club rooms are spacious, clean and with a good range of refreshments. Moulton Brown toiletries in the bathroom make a difference, too!Club lounge is a great place to relax.Having stayed at about 20 different hotels this year, would rate this one 1st."
75,679,"Nov 4 2008 	Very nice!	Spent four nights here mid-week in September 2008 on business. Started in a standard room on the second floor above the kitchen. 2 nights in a row the cleaning crew woke me up at 2AM with all of the banging &amp; clanging while moving appliances during cleaning! Finally after getting angry - I phoned the front desk around 3 AM to ask what was going on and stated that I'd be down to see the manager in the morning. The next morning the manager apologized and had already addressed the issue with the cleaning crew. He offered a room upgrade to a business suite on the 6th floor and the last two nights of my stay were very pleasant. I think the rooms were very nice, clean, well appointed. I was comfortable in the standard room, the suite was near double the size. Everything in the hotel was in top notch condition.When my wife &amp; I moved on to a more affordable hotel for the vacation portion of our trip - the condition of the next hotel was what set the Crowne Plaza apart. The Park Plaza Victoria was great for the money, but paled in comparison to the Crowne Plaza (as you would expect).Having never been to London - I was afraid to stay in the City on weekends because it sounds like everything shuts down and would be very dull. But knowing what I know now - I would stay here on weekends. It's right on the river and across from a tube stop. Can hop on/off a tour bus just up the street at St. Paul's. We went out for all our meals and the room was just for relaxing/sleeping - you would have no regrets here. And we loved the pub across the street!"
76,679,"Nov 3 2008 	Very Pleasant Stay	My husband and I stayed in the Crowne Plaza London as part of a theatre break for our first wedding anniversary.The hotel was modern, well decorated and extremely pleasant. We arrived at around middday and were told that our room was not ready but that we could leave our bags with the concierge. After checking out on our last day, we also left our bags with the concierge so that we could go shopping for a few hours.Our room on the first floor was spacious with modern decor. The bed was very comfortable and towelling robes were provided. Breakfast was included in our theatre and hotel package and we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was a buffet style help yourself breakfast from which you could have cereal, cooked breakfast, fruit, pastries- as little or as much as you wanted.The reception staff were always friendly and helpful. We did have a drink in the hotel bar which was a little expensive but no more so than in any other London hotel bar.The best thing about this hotel is its location very close to Blackfriars tube station. We will definitley come back."
77,679,"Nov 2 2008 	great location - friendly front desk	I arrived at the hotel with a privat shuttle from the airport - a bellman took my suitcase and guided me to the check in desk. That was fast and very friendly and personal! (Mirko was the best)The same bellman brought me and my bag to the room and showed me everything in it. The bed is nice, but not as nice as the most US chains with their sleeper beds. Comp. water was in the room for the first night.The location is great - if you walk 15 - 20 minutes you can reach most tourist stuff in downtown London. GREAT!!After the first night, the cleaning lady knocked multiple times at my door and even opened it - well, there was a do not disturb sign out?! Why was she doing this? I complaint at the front desk and they dealed with the situation from their on.Nice hotel, good service but not a service heaven."
78,679,"Nov 1 2008 	Beware of Room 104	Conveniently located business hotel, however our room was directly above one of the restaurants and they were moving tables &amp; chairs around night and day. The Italian restaurant was delicious but the service was sub par. Overall, the stay was worth what we paid for but not the rack rate."
79,679,"Oct 13 2008 	okay but not brilliant	Booked a standard room from Lastminute.com, their 'secret hotels' deal (advertised as savings up to 40% of the normal cost). In fact, had I booked directly with the hotel it would have only cost an extra 4 per night. A standard room was exactly what it stated, a very small disabled room, with double bed. For a 4* hotel I did expect better. The room was half heartedly made up after our first night- the one bathrobe was simply left lying crumpled up on the chair. At least the bed had been made. There was nowhere to hang the bathrobe or towels, and very space to put your case or store clothes. Complimentary water is left in the room for the first night only. It doesn't get replaced if your stay is longer. Loose tiles in the bathroom by the toilet bowl. The hotel does occupy a prime site by the tube and the river, handy for most places. Breakfast was not included and very expensive."
80,679,"Sep 16 2008 	Brilliant location for London stay	Weekend-break stay, I usually have 1 or 2 in London per year and this is the best located Hotel I have stayed in. 15mins walk into Theatreland, Covent Garden etc, or cross the bridge into the South Bank area. There is no need to get Tubes/Taxis unless you are going far or don't like walking.Reception was very helpful, arrived early so room not ready, but they took my mobile no. and called me later that afternoon as soon as room was ready. Spacious, modern room. I didn't use any of the hotel restaurants, only the bar, which was pricey but hey it's London. Being based in 'The City', there are numerous cafes, pubs, diners and a Starbucks/Pret a Manger on every corner, but most of these are closed on weekends (no office workers)."
81,679,"Aug 24 2008 	Nice Hotel Great Location	Stayed here on Thurs/Fri in Aug 08 with my wife.First, the hotel is in a great location. Across the street from the Blackfriars underground station and a direct train ride from Gatwick. Note: if you have luggage and take the train, there are some stairs to climb to get across the street. Aside from the Underground, you can walk to several tourist sites, restaurants, etc. Very close to the river.Check-in was quick and efficient. Room was average size with about average amenities. King bed (comfortable), nice closet, desk, chairs, chest, tv. Bathroom had a tub, sink and toilet. Nice amenities.The staff was friendly and guest-oriented. Quickly and efficiently handled special requests and got a cab for the airport (Heathrow) quickly. Cost about 55 pounds and took about 35 minutes to get to Heathrow on Saturday afternoon (little traffic).Although a business hotel, it's in a great location and has reduced rates (for London) on the weekend. A good overall experience."
82,679,"Aug 24 2008 	A hotel that caters for business travelers	I have stayed in this hotel numerous times (probably 20 times in last 18 months)- it is perfectly located near Embankment in the City. The River Thames and Blackfriars Bridge are just a short stroll away. The hotels main clientele are business travellers working for many of the large blue chip firms located in the area. The rooms are clean and well serviced. The Italian restaurant serves good food and there's a good variety of food for breakfast (which is also very expensive!). The bar is normally quiet . There's good TV and internet facilities in the rooms also. All in all, it's a good four star hotel. The South Bank is only 5-10 minutes walk away and there's plenty of good bars and restaurants to choose from. I have only ate in the hotel once in all the times I stayed there - there's too many good restaurants nearby to stay in!"
83,679,"Aug 10 2008 	Great fantastic why stay anywhere else?	We had a great weeked at the crown plaza. A good location right on the river, perfect for anything on the south bank. I booked directly with the hotel and got a 2 for 1 night deal, making it great value. We had a lovely room with excellent beds and pillows. My only complaint was that our breakfast was not included and at 19.99 for a full buffet it must be one of the most expensive breakfasts in London. We only had it one morning because we were starving, but knew better by the next morning!I will be making it my local stay when in town, but will definately be going out for breakfast."
84,679,"Jul 21 2008 	Comfortable	Haven't stayed at too many Crowne Plazas over the years and wouldn't think to try one in London. But found it on Hotwire and it wound up being surprisingly pleasant. Was suspicious about all of the positive reviews but have to agree it is a decent choice if you can get it for the right price. Lobby and restaurants are particularly attractive and comfortable, the rooms a bit less so. Also thought the internet charge in the room was obscene. Other than that not a bad London base if you want or need to be in or near the City."
85,679,"Jun 29 2008	Pleasant staff and clean modern hotel	Used my reward points for this stay. Hotel is in a reasonably good location near Blackfriars tube station. It's probably a 15 minute walk to the London Eye. We got taxis most times and that cost about 10 to Leicester Square, the Strand etc. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready, infact it wasn't ready for 3pm either. I am Gold with IC Hotels so was bit disappointed by this but we went out for a few drinks then returned to find the Hotel had upgraded me to the Exec Floor- I thought this was really nice and found the staff in this hotel, both in the bar and front desk to be very friendly and helpful. Lovely bathroom but the toiletries were a bit sparce; a tiny bottle of shower gel and shampoo for 2 people- I'm talking 30-45ml here. Bed really comfortable and room was immaculate! Well stocked tea/coffee facilities and minibar. I stayed here one night so didn't get to try out the the Room Service. Shame really as I like to sample food in most hotels I go to. Good bar/restaurant too, but found it rather odd that the bar doesn't open until 4pm!? Nice views from the Executive/Club floor too. Again, well done to the staff at this hotel who did go out their way to make a guest's stay more pleasant. I'd recommend this hotel to friends and family. Enjoy your stay!"
86,679,"Jun 24 2008 	Another lovely stay.....	I have recently returned from a stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel London City. At check-in I was warmly greeted and upgraded to a Club Studio Suite which was a great touch as I am a platinum elite and Intercontinental Ambassador member of priority club.The room was excellent and had a sofa, table and chairs, king bed, DVD player, IPOD docking station and marble bathroom complete with Molton Brown amenities. I also had a lovely letter from Guest Relations welcoming me back to the hotel. Turndown service was also provided.I also had access to the Plaza club lounge on level 6. Refreshments and snacks are available throughout the day. From 18:00 a self service cocktail bar, wine and beer are available together with a selection of evening canaps, and are served until 22:00. My rate included breakfast which was served in the hotels Spicers Restaurant. The breakfast was excellent including cold and warm choice. Breakfast was served from 07:00 until 11:00am during my trip.Overall I had a fantastic stay at the Crowne Plaza London - The City, and many thanks for the upgraded room. I look forward to returning!"
87,679,Jun 11 2008 	Enjoyable stay at Crowne Plaza	Just wiritng to say what an excellent time we had in London!!!The hotel was really central so we walked everywhere which was enjoyable as the weather was very kind to us.I loved the hotel - the cleanliness of the rooms - I also liked the use of the cards to activate the lights as it saves power which all goes to help the green issue. I also liked the breakfast atmosphere - not rushed just relaxed and a nice start to the day.The staff were all very helpful - very friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and relations.  Carol CloseBurstwickHU12 9HS
88,679,"Jun 10 2008 	a breath of fresh air in the financial centre	Have stayed at the Crowne Plaza London City now four times, and have always had a good experience. I come to London a A LOT, and I have often been able to find a good deal at this hotel. It's located in The City, so if you are planning tons of things to do very close to you, or having an abundance of places to eat at all hours, it may not be the place for you. But having said that, it's an easy 15 minute walk to loads of restaurants, etc, and there's public transport right outside the hotel, although during one stay the tube station was shut the entire time, but that's not the fault of the hotel. The hotel itself is very modern, and tastefully done. Was able to stay in a deluxe room or a club room the first three times here, and it was worth the little extra. The room was large, clean, and had a wonderful bathroom. The last time I stayed, we were only able to get a standard room, which was nice but nowhere near as big as the others. Have only eaten room service here, but the food was good, and if you are a member and are able to get access to the Club Lounge, they always have free drinks and nibbles available in the evenings."
89,679,"May 8 2008 	Good Location Near The Tube	We recently spent 2 days in London and wanted a decent hotel close to the trains and Tube (aka London's subway). This one is across the street from the Blackfriars Station. Being this was a Crowne Plaza, the hotel was very clean with updated contemporary deco. We arrived early and of course our room wasn't ready. They tried to upgrade us to a suite (for more $$ of course), but we declined. We were able to store our luggage in a room behind the reception area. I suggest, as we did, that you lock your luggage w/locks. We didn't have any problems, but just in case...We had a standard double room. The pictures for this room on the Crowne Plaza website are pretty accurate. The only thing I didn't like was that the elevator and lights in the room required you to enter your key card. The bed was comfy and plenty of pillows. Blankets were in the closet and adj. thermostat on the wall. Note that the hairdryer was in a drawer in the closet. There was a dryer attached to the wall, I think it was meant to dry a man's beard. There was a weight sensor bar in the room, under the TV. Very expensive for items, even before the British Pound to US conversion. They have internet access through the room TV. However, I recommend going to their center. The TV keyboard was not very user friendly. If I recall, I think either option cost 10 lbs.We ate at the restaurant 1 level up from the main lobby for breakfast. It was ok by our standards. It had more local food on the buffet, things that we didn't like too much. Looking back it was a chance to try some of their food."
90,679,"Apr 30 2008 	Great central spot	We reserved a king room on the extremely quiet executive floor after crossing the Atlantic on the Queen Mary 2. Our room was large and comfortable although I did feel the bed was a bit too hard. As always, the best thing about staying on the executive floor of a Crowne Plaza is the free internet, wonderful breakfast and generous early evening wine and canape spread, which is a treat if you are planning to go to the theatre before having dinner. Hotel staff can't do enough to help with your travel planning and transportation. It was a big anniversary during our stay and my elderly mother called from Canada wanting to send us a bottle of wine. Although the hotel does not have its own restaurant a staff member went shopping especially and went to great pains to let my mother know it was taken care of. The hotel is located in Blackfriars: close to St.Paul's Cathedral, a couple of blocks from Fleet Street with its historic pubs and a quick walk across the bridge to the South Bank with the New Tate, London Eye and New Globe. While there is not much going on at night in the immediate neighbourhood, there is a historic pub across the street and the tube is only a block away. If you go the South Bank, don't miss Borough Market: wandering around is a nice change of pace from visiting historic London and the galleries. While London pub food is pretty much the same everywhere you go, and seems to be, for the most part, brought in and microwaved, it's worth trying gastropubs-- which offer ultra-modern takes on traditional British grub. One we highly recommend is the Anchor and Hope in Waterloo."
91,679,Apr 28 2008 	Excellent Hotel - excellent service - excellent all round!	We stayed here for two nights and have to say - from the very quick check in to the fabulous concierge service and the superb Club Lounge facilities (for those who have paid a little more!!) everything was faultless.We booked a Club Room on the Club Floor/Executive floor and found it very comfortable. Room service was also very quick and well received after a few vinos round the City!!Overall I would highly recommend the Hotel for business users and couples alike.
92,679,"Apr 22 2008 	Loved this hotel	Stayed at the Crown Plaza The City during 4 days city trip.When looking for a high class hotel that is reasonably priced during the weekend, (travel agent deal, 3 days for 2) and not too far from the center I was happily surprised with this hotel. Beautiful room, well equiped, brand clean and nice bathroom with ... at last, normal water pressure in the shower !Nice personal at check in. Took about 5 minutes to check us in.Bed (kingsize) was extremely soft, liked that very much, coffee and tea facilties in the room, good (large) TV.In the morning the breakfast was very good, typical English breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausages, beans, toast, marmelade...liked that to !Not used to use the tube (metro) I learn'd it in 5 minutes !After then, we had several rides with the tube to every place we had planned to visit, perfect system !!! London itself, all this, and...not to forget, only 30 meters from tube station Blackfriars made our London citytrip unforgettable !Already booked a new stay early September this year, hope I will encounter the same service.Only one minor : highly priced hotel restaurants."
93,679,"Apr 20 2008 	great rate through hotwire but held for extortion at check out	Booked seven nights through Hotwire at good discount from the rack rate. Received an interior room on the second floor with two double beds. Comfortable bed and linens, good sized bathroom and ample closet and drawer space. Well located near tube station and good fitness facilities. The not so good: some of the staff had limited English language skills.The booking was for four people as per the booking details confirmed. Checked in with three people and was given a room with two double beds as would be expected for a booking that could accommodate the number of confirmed guests. As it turned out the holiday plans of the fourth person changed and there was only the three of us staying in the room.  On review of the room folio on check out I was advised by the duty manager that there would be a charge of 35.25 pounds per night for the third person in the room as the hotel was only paid by Hotwire for two people in the room. Even though I presented my written confirmation from Hotwire.com with four guests and a verbal confirmation from Hotwire.com that the booking was for four guests the duty manager was unbending in his resolve to collect the additional person surcharge. He went on to advise that it was my problem not the hotel's and I would have to follow up with Hotwire. If I had booked through any other opaque booking site ie. Priceline.com I would fully understand the the room was for two people but Hotwire is unique in that up to four people can be confirmed ( the rates and availibility vary with the number of persons booked). Hotwire has advised that I am to submit the invoice for the additional person surcharge and they will reimburse me. While this is not ideal I am somewhat satisfied that my booking is in part honoured although no effort was made by the hotel itself to resolve the issue."
94,679,"Apr 17 2008 	marathon experience	Booked on the London marathon package, but in the meantime I had to drop out of the race due to injury, but went ahead with the weekend anyway. As part of the package was a bus to the race start, I told the desk clerk the reason i wouldn't require this. When we came back to the room later, there was an envelope under the door which worried me. However, inside was a lovely card with a message about being sorry i couldn't do the marathon, but hoped I had a great weekend anyway, which I found very touching, and something that the hotel didn't have to do. Overall, after staying here twice, I found this to be probably the best hotel I've stayed at in London (I stay up to 14 nights a year in London on business)-staff are excellent, rooms good to excellent depending on which you get, and overall service excellent."
95,679,Apr 14 2008 	Great hotel	Stayed here for a weekend in April - in a Club studio roomReally great facilities and a huge room with sofa and comfy chairSmallish bathroom with a mediocre shower Warm and friendly staff in reception/ breakfast and the Club loungeHad dinner in the Italian restaurant - SUPERB - an undiscovered gem - Proper coffee maker in the room and chocolates too Really really liked it here ( second stay this year)
96,679,"Apr 7 2008	Happy stay	The hotel is very well located next to the Metro station and in the oldest part of London, Temple area - Fleet street with charmy streets and a lot of typical pubs.The stylish and modern decoration makes the hotel warm and welcoming event the lobby is huge. A very nice idea with the chemine in the lobby, not very usual for a hotel.Breakfast needs improvement. The rooms are large and quiet, the beds comfortable.A special remark regarding the staff: extremely friendly, smilling and helpful (frond desk, bell boys and restaurant staff, all), they make you feel well and welcome. We have enjoyed our stay a lot and we would like to come back."
97,679,"Apr 3 2008 	Highly recommend	Our family thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay at this hotel. Excellent position next to Blackfriars bridge and tube station and walking distance of the South Bank, Waterloo (if travelling light), St. Pauls, The City and Covent Garden. Very friendly staff who went out of their way to help. Restaurant and brasserie not cheap but food of a very high standard. Lovely clean comfortable room and very quiet at the weekend considering its central location. Overall would definitely return to this hotel."
98,679,"Mar 29 2008 	Great Place to Stay	Great location and superb value.Restaurant was great value - Locatelli oversees.Walk across Blackfriars and turn left for Tate modern and southwark market. Right takes you to the NT, Millenium wheel and a short walk to westminster.The tube is just outside, as is the bus stop.a short walk to St Paul's and the City.Quiet and lovely room.Cannot fault this place"
99,679,"Mar 25 2008 	Terrific Value 	OUTSTANDING VALUE for the price we paid! Brilliant location, just outside exit#8 from the Blackfriars tube station and a short walk from the Temple tube stop .. ..Considering the gorgeous room we received and the terrifc rate we got on PRICELINE (50GBP per night), I can't remember a more perfect stay in the city, and I am in London a lot!Check-in was wonderful and MARTA even called up to the room to make sure all was well (after changing rooms) and that she was able to search/find our membership #!And, when our hotpot didn't work, the housekeeping staff was at our room in minutes to fix it .. .. WOW!FUN HINT &gt; For those who are fans of 'THE DA VINCI CODE' and other religious occult, there is a Wednesday Walk (afternoon) from the front of the TEMPLE TUBE STATION that takes you to Temple Church and other nearby locations of interest - NEAT!"
100,679,"Feb 19 2008 	very convenient location	We stayed here right after Christmas for three days, and it was a very comfortable hotel with a great location right off the Blackfriars stop on the Tube, so it was convenient to everything. As it was probably a low time for business travelers, it wasn't very busy. We were somewhat disappointed by the very pleasant but seemingly inexperienced concierge staff (we were looking for a pub to watch the soccer matches, but they wouldn't really help us find one which would be open). The manager (Lisa?) was very helpful with everything we needed from her, and very responsive to any concerns we had. (There had been some discrepancies as to the amenities on the website promotion compared to their actual policies, such as internet access, etc.) All in all it was a great holiday and I would recommend this hotel and definitely stay here again when in London."
101,679,"Feb 11 2008 	Excellent Location - Great Staff - Great Price!	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza London City on Saturday 09.02.08. I paid about 103.00 (including tax), for a double room through the Hotel website (which was in fact the cheapest on the net).We were a little concerned that we wouldn't be able to check in ready for a lunch reservation as we were there at 10.30am. (Official check-in was 14:00. We were very wrong. Our bags were taken immediately and the very friendly reception staff made the check-in very quick &amp; easy. The Deluxe room (as shown on our room receipt), was spacious (by London standards, aprox 30sqm) and very clean. The bed was large and very comfortable. TV had free Sky with plenty to watch if you didn't intend venturing out. Provided were WHITE CO. bathroom products, really good shower, bath robes, iron and board, trouser press, internet, CD player and mini-bar.The only gripe I have with the room was that there was only 1 plug socket provided in the whole room which was not enough for the both of us.The lobby is big and well presented, with comfortable sofa's and a large fire. I was however dissapointed that we were not able to use the great looking hotel bar, as it had been reserved for a private function. I felt this was very inconsiderate to all the other hotel guests. I cannot comment on the restaurant as we didn't eat at the hotel.The location is fantastic. A stones throw from St Pauls Cathedral, 20mins walk to tower bridge and The Tower of London. In the other direction, The London Eye is aprox 20mins walk along the Thames and The Millenium Bridge and Tate Modern are 5mins walk. Blackfriers tube is right outside the hotel and 2 stops will take you to Covent Garden and the West End. Great for business too as right on the edge of The City.Overall a very good hotel in an extremely good location. Can't be beaten really given the excellent price.Will be staying here on my next visit to London."
102,679,"Feb 10 2008	good service	Really liked it. Friendly staff. Good standard rooms. Very good breakfast and also the bar is very comfy.Had a good deal (3 nights paying 2 including breakfast)The size of the room is a bit more than average but has all the things you need. The bed (king) could be better, too soft and too small for me, only one matrass. Next time i take queen beds !Nice concierge. We come back !"
103,679,Feb 5 2008 	Fantastic Location	This is a really nice hotel next to he blackfriars tube station and a minuets walk from the Thames and St Pauls. Staff were really friendly and helpfull. Room was big which is a suprise for london.
104,679,"Jan 20 2008 	Would have been great even without the free upgrade!	We stayed here with friends on a theatre break and we got off to a good start when one of the two rooms was upgraded to a 'club room'. The very friendly receptionist, after seeing us toss a coin to see who would benefit from the upgrade, had a look on the system and upgraded the second room as well. Rooms were clean, well furnished and a good size. Position of the hotel excellent, about 100 yards from Blackfriars underground station just off the embankment. We were able to walk to Westminster in about 35 minutes, the West End would be around 20 mins away. Full English breakfast included in the deal was the best I've had in a London Hotel. Will definately use again."
105,679,Jan 20 2008 	Wonderful Hotel	We stayed in this hotel for a long weekend.The staff on all levels from reception to house keeping were very polite and helpful.The room was spacious and breakfast was good. It is situated just a few steps away from Blackfriars tube station so it was easy to get about. The hotel restaurant Referrito is wonderful well worth a visit. If you want cheap good pub food in large portions try the Blackfriars pub accross the road . We have stayed in many hotels in London before and this for us was the best.We shall definitely be returning.
106,679,"Jan 12 2008 	Great spot to stay	My husband and I have just returned from a very enjoyable stay at the Crowne Plaza. The hotel was very clean, the rooms modern, with everything you needed, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. We booked through Airmiles and managed to get a good deal. The restaurant is quite pricey, but we found ample of places to eat nearby. Particulary worth a mention are O'Neills, just up the road in New Bridge Street, very nice staff and atmosphere, with lovely reasonably priced food. Also, the Founders Arms, right next to the Tate Modern, on the riverside, we had a lovely roast dinner on the Sunday and it is only a short walk away over Blackfriars Bridge. We found the hotel very conveniently placed for what we needed - with St Pauls, The Millennium Bridge and Tate Modern very close and we booked to see Dirty Dancing at the Aldwych theatre, which was only 15 mins walk away. The Thames clipper is a great way to get around, particularly if you want to visit the O2 venue.If you're travelling to London by train it might be worth checking out any special offers that they might have, as we managed to get several '2 for 1' deals on entry to attractions etc.Would definately recommend and visit again."
107,679,"Dec 4 2007 	Great Value	I stayed here for a total of four nights over two weekends at the end of November. I got a ridiculously low price of $103 a night on hotwire (I paid about $400 for the whole stay and could find nothing less than $1,300 for the same nights on the hotel website). For that kind of money it is hard to say anything bad for a hotel in London, where total dumps can cost that much. For the first stay I arrived about 1:00 and was told my room was not ready, but if I wanted to upgrade for 40 GBP I could get a room right away. I declined and was told the room be ready in an hour. I left my luggage and went across the street to pub for a pint. When I returned the room was ready. It was a very nice room, positively gigantic by London standards. It was nicely appointed, modern and very clean. I could not have been happier. For the second stay the room was ready when I arrived at 3:30 and I was not offered any upgrades.The hotel is located next to the Blackfriars tube stop (exit #8). It is a bit more out of the way than I would normally prefer. Still, I was only a 20-25 walk to Charring Cross Rd (about 10 min by tube) along the picturesque Victoria Embankment. It was very easy to get to wherever I wanted to go. All in all, a great hotel for the price I got."
108,679,"Nov 23 2007 	Highly Recommended	My husband and I travelled to London this month and stayed at the Crown Plaza The City.Since the very beginning the staff was very friendly and helpful, We arrived via Express Train to the Black Friars Station and the hotel was located right there we only had to cross the street.We arrived about 10:00am and eventough the check in time was at 2:00 they let us check in immediatly ...no hassles at allPaulo from the front desk was really friendly and helpful, he directed us to the concierge of the hotel with provided us with maps and recommended losts of nice places and tours. The room was very modern but comfortable and very clean. It was a little small but hey,, thats EuropeIts not very close to the touristic area though ( trafalgar square and Buckingham were about 20 minutes in subway) but St Paul cathedrals and the Tate were a wt walking distanceHighly recommended"
109,679,"Oct 13 2007 	Crowne Plaze cannot be beat for price	I am giving this hotel the highest rating possible primarily due to the incredible rate we received via hotwire. We were in London for two weeks and spent all of our time at this hotel. The rate we received was $116 per night US with tax and service fees of approx another $14 US for a total of $130 US per night. The hotel is not in the center of town, but you are only 10 minutes away from the heart of the West End, Big Ben, etc. via tube or bus. Also as noted, it is very convenient to the National Theatre, Tate, Globe, St. Paul's, etc. We went to church at St Brides which has a paid choir, just up the street. We thought the service was better than other services we attended at St. Pauls and Westminister this trip. Highly recommended for Anglican church goers. Back the the hotel, the room was clean and modern, which would suit the mainly business class that primarily stays here. We asked for something facing the street, which we were given, and we were given a slightly larger room. I guess because of the lengh of our stay. Staff was very helpful, many of them being from eastern europe, Hugh modern lobby with art and gas fireplace. Do not expect to have breakfast at the hotel. it will cost you approx. $40 US per person. I aspect that you get such a deep discount on the room because they hope you will use the restaurants, use the phone, or mini bar, all of which are extremely expensive. There are many small cafes, a starbucks across the street. that will provide a more reasonable morning meal.Get Oyster Card for travel around the City. If you come into Gatwick, take the train, no tube at this airport, to Blackfairs stop. Finally do not have tea at the Savoy, unless you are loaded, $176 US for two. We have been to London more times than I can count and this was by far the BEST HOTEL VALUE for the money we have ever gotten, but you need to get close to what we got. Their usual discount is around $200 - $ 230 US and this really is a discount when you are looking at a rack rate of $300 US plus."
110,679,"Sep 24 2007 	Good location for South Bank	I stayed at Crowne Plaza for a long girlie weekend. We found a very good offer at hotelconnections.co.uk. Our main target was the Tate Modern and all the new, interesting sights on the South Bank  and of course shopping! The location for this was perfect, just steps away and so was the tube. The room was large and the beds were huge, we had a nice quiet room facing a back street. Breakfast was included in the room, and there was a large selection, both cold and warm. The staff was helpful and plesant.The only downside is, as the hotel is located in the financial district, there arent many restaurants in the area. But if you get a good deal its definitely worth staying here."
111,679,"Sep 20 2007	Fine overall but nothing special	Stayed here for i night in September 07. First room smelly and damp. Asked for a change and got a much better room. Facilities good. Trendy bar. Good breakfast. Also location is nice , near St Pauls , Blackfriarsand Fleet Street. Reception staff helpfull , but seemed inexperienced and not too strong on their English"
112,679,"Sep 12 2007 	surpassed my expectations	I read most of the reviews on this website before making my reservation. I had high expectations and was not disappointed. Stayed at the hotel during a long weekend from 25 to 27 August 2007. Used priorityclub points. We arrived early, at about 9h30 after a 11 hour flight from South Africa. Not only were we allowed to check in early, we were also upgraded to the club floor. Staff were extremely friendly and efficient. The room was very spacious for London standard , stylishly furnished and the bed was big and comfortable. Unlike some of the other guest reviews, I found the location to be excellent. A short stroll across the Blackfriars bridge takes you to the Tate Modern and several river side restaurants and pubs. The underground station is just across the road and within minutes you can be at Trafalgar Square, Westminster, London eye, Londen tower, ect."
113,679,"Sep 6 2007 	Clean and Comfortable. Recommended.	We stayed for two nights in early September and were very happy with pretty much eveything. Our standard room was modern, clean and very quiet seeing as it faced the road outside. The bed was really confortable and the bathroom, while not huge was big enough. Compared to other hotels in the same price bracket, we were also pleasantly surpised by the breakfast: good choice of food and not wall-to-wall grease!While the hotel is close to the financial district, it's got a tube staton across the street and is only 5 minutes walk to the South Bank and all its attractions such as Tate Modern, National Theatre and London Eye. Recommended."
114,679,"Sep 3 2007 	great london hotel	Stayed here for long weekend , booked on hotwire at brilliant dollar rate of about 68 english pounds per night and was very pleasantly surprised. Hotel is stylish, modern, very clean and staff very helpful. Good 4 star standard. Rooms are standard size but very nicely furnished , clean with good facilities and bathroom. We asked for quiet room and got it facing inner courtyard and heard no noise at all from busy road outside. Very handy for tube right outside door, and easy walk to St Pauls Cathedral , over Millennium Bridge and onto Tate Modern etc.Was quite expensive to get taxis to theatre area , Regent street and Knightsbridge shops so bear this in mind, but we walked or got tube in day and took taxis back at night to hotel. Also Loads of places nearby towards St Pauls to eat breakfast in the morning.Would definitely recommend staying here especially on that Hotwire rate!!"
115,679,"Aug 30 2007 	Crown Plaza - large rooms and poor service	This property is an small business hotel, with excellent proximity to the financial district. We stayed in a room with 2 queen sized beds and the linen was wonderful! The room was large and comfortable - modern design. We loved the trouser presser in the closet.Unfortunately, right across the narrow street, there was a full blown construction site. So rooms on that side of the building have noise and views of the construction all day long. There was no notification of this prior to arrival. We found out that the rooms in the center of the building do not have outside windows. They have a window that looks into the core hallway in the center of the building. We were uncomfortable that someone in a hallway above or below could look into our room, unless we kept the curtains drawn all the time. The wall safe did not work, but they did replace unit after an hour. Unfortunately, the desk clerk was quite rude when we wanted a room change. Finally, we sought out the manager and she arranged for a room change the following day. No mention of this type of design anywhere on the website.Breakfast was standard english breakfast buffet, staff was efficient and unobtrusive. Room service was good and on time. Actually the bell service in this hotel was excellent, friendly, helpful and credit to the property. Our desk clerk could take some lessons from the bell staff."
116,679,"Aug 29 2007	Excellent room location and service - Even for lowly hotwire guests	We stayed for a week at the Crowne Plaza in August. Got an amazing deal on Hotwire so the place was dirt cheap.Service: All of the service was superb. We used the concierge quite extensively for bookings and information and they provided us with great service. They made several restaurant recs and had no problem recommending places off the beaten path if we asked. Every time I entered the hotel, I got a hello Mr. X from the staff. The cleaning staff was wonderful as well. Our room was tip top shape always.Room: Room was large, especially by London standards. We had a standard room on the first floor. No outside noise could be heard in the room. Room had a gorgeous marble bathroom. While a little small it was very stylish with the marble and had a nice shower with good water pressure. Room also had a safe, hair dryer, etc. - all the things you expect in a luxury hotel. Bed was comfortable. Nice bonus: Free bottles of water in the roomLocation: I believe it is a great location for a tourist. I always stay in the city. 15 minutes your in Covent Garden, the Tate, Southwark (markets), St Pauls. 10 min in the tube and your at the Tower of London. 15 min tube your at the British Library, British Museum, etc. And there are buses from Picadilly back to the hotel.Negatives: Internet is pricey. Carry your laptop to the lobby and connect to the City of London Wireless for a 10th of the price."
117,679,"Aug 20 2007 	OK- Not the best Crowne Plaza I have stayed in	I am a reasonably regular traveller and have stayed in Marriotts or holiday inn / crowne plaza where possible. I booked this for a trip to celebrate my wifes 30th birthday as I felt that the Crowne Plaza would be a pleasant experience for a weeked.Generally there were no major issues with the hotel. Check in was fast, efficient and friendly and they remained so thorughout the stay. Small gripe about the room, 305 was that hte carpet was lifted in ridges in spots in the room and generally looked worn giving a poor appearance to the room. Bed was excellent and comfortable. Room was quiet which is something htat I always look for.On the negative side food and drink is priced at company expenses level. I bought a Bombay Sapphire with Tonic and a pint of Guinness on the first night for 12. Poor show as they got no more business from me for the remaining two days. But then they are not aiming the prices at leisure guests.Hotel is a little out of hte way for leisure but London is well serviced by the tube so it really makes little difference."
118,679,"Aug 14 2007 	Alright for a short stay	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza City Hotel for two nights in early August. Overall the hotel is a decent three star facility conveniently located next to the Blackfriars tube stop on the District line. We took the recommendation from another tripadvisor reviewer and took the Piccadilly line from London Heathrow and changed at South Kensington to the District line. The overall travel time was a little over an hour including the purchase of the oyster cards. On reaching the Blackfriars tube station come out exit 8 which will put you right in front of the hotel.Our room was on the 5th floor and had two double beds. The room was a decent size and considerably clean. The toilet was another story, although it looked very clean on first glance but when we checked the toilet bowl it had remnants of poop stuck to the wall, it had obviously not been cleaned after checkout. Look at the attached picture. There was a lady from housekeeping on our floor that very time working in another room so I grabbed her quickly. She apologized a lot and cleaned it right away. After seeing this I didnt have a warm feeling about the other things even though they looked clean. When you pay $400/night your minimum expectation is that it should be at least clean.The first day we called housekeeping to get an extra pillow and it was brought in 5 minutes. The second day after the room was cleaned the pillow was still there but without a cover, so called again, this time to get a cover. It was brought in 5 minutes.We never ate breakfast at the hotel, plenty of choices around like Costa Coffee, Pret A Manger and others for getting breakfast and lunch sandwiches. There was also a restaurant nearby serving English breakfast for 6.50. London is expensive so be prepared to pay big money for everything if traveling from US.At night the area gets very quite as its in a business location but we liked it this way. There are no restaurants nearby for dinner or at least we could not find any.Overall it was a pleasant two days and if I overlook the toilet situation then I might stay here again."
119,679,"Jul 26 2007 	Super hotel	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights for a weekend break in June. I am pleased to report that at last I have found a Five Star hotel that actually felt like a Five Star hotel, even in a standard room! Check in was fairly prompt and efficient. The porter who took us to our room was really first class and remained so throughout our stay. We could not really find fault with the room at all, it was spacious and very well fitted out in all respects. There was a very minor glitch with a bathroom accessory, but this was sorted out promptly. For breakfast, an additional self service point was created at the far end of the restaurant, the heating arrangements meant that the food could have been hotter; however, the food was of good quality and quantity. There was some confusion amongst the staff as to whether coffee/tea pots would be left on the table or whether they would provide top ups, fortunately the former was the case which was good as the service was not that quick. We completed a Customer Feedback Form highlighting the minor shortcomings we found and got a virtually instant e-mail response back which was very good. We didnt use the bar or restaurant in the evening (as you would expect from such a hotel, the prices were pretty high). The hotel is well located near Charing Cross mail line and tube stations and only 5 minutes walk from the river. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Crowne Plaza and would definitely come again."
120,679,"Jul 25 2007 	Good 5 stars hotel in center	Very good location few meters from Tamiza River, St. Paul Cathedral and Paternoster Square (London Stock Excange).Nice rooms - I stayed on Club Level, so all needed amenities in my room were available. Very comfortable and big bed (single room). Also DVD player, hi fi system and of course internet in the room."
121,679,"Jul 15 2007 	Nice hotel with great location	I am a Priority Club Gold member and my wife and I decided to stay here for 2 nights on points (July 4 - 6). Needless to say, it was well worth it. We reserved a king size bed and it was nice and cozy. Upon check-in and each morning, a complimentary bottle of mineral and carbonated water is left in the room - we thought that was a nice touch.I've been told that hotel rooms in London are typically on the smaller side, but this room was spacious enough for us. The concierge will typically recommend the breakfast in the hotel, but we opted out as the prices were astronomical. There are a couple of restaurants just down the street from the hotel that serve a hearty breakfast and are very much more reasonably priced (as you would expect eating breakfast at a restaurant in the US). I would recommend &quot;The Ludgate Cafe&quot; - nice portions and very decent priced. When exiting the hotel from the 2nd floor entrance, turn left and walk a couple of blocks. It will be on your left hand side. I ordered the &quot;Full English breakfast&quot; and it kept me full until well after lunch time.My only negative experience with the hotel (if anything) was that we never received our wake-up call, but luckily we had set it on my wife's cell phone just in case. I don't think this is the norm so i would chalk it up to being a fluke occurrence. One thing we noticed too was that there was only one available and accessible outlet to plug your electronic items into. This didn't really affect us, but we did find it a bit odd.The location of this hotel is fantastic! The hotel is literally like a few feet from the &quot;Blackfriars&quot; tube station. A hint - when exiting the &quot;Blackfriars&quot; tube stop, follow signs for Exit # 8. Exit 8 is on the same side as of the hotel and only about 50 feet away; otherwise if you follow any other exit, you will need to cross a pretty busy street to get to the hotel. All the major sites are practically 2-4 tube stations away. It was very convenient! I would highly recommend purchasing the day passes (even cheaper if you begin your day after 9:30am - considered an &quot;Off peak&quot; day pass). The day pass costs something to the like of 5-6 pounds. The tube is the best form of public transportation I've ever experienced - better than NYC.The staff is also very friendly and seemed to be fluent in several languages, and the room was very quiet. Even though it faced what seemed to be a major street, we heard nothing! And for those that crave that cup of coffee, there's a Costa Coffee shop nearly just beside the hotel and a Starbucks accross the street."
122,679,"Jul 12 2007 	More for business but good for tourists	Four of us, two adults and two teenage children stayed in a room with two double beds. The room was clean. The beds were not as comfortable as we had hoped. I should note we are used to a queen size bed. These were double beds.The staff was friendly and courteous. However, one gave us an incorrect bus number that led us to a part of London most tourists do not see. Once we picked up our London Passes, along with our transportation tickets, we had no trouble getting around. There is an underground station in close proximity to the hotel. St. Paul's Cathedral is within walking distance.The fellow who brought our bags to the room showed us things in a small refrigerator and explained we would be billed for them as soon as we removed them. This did not surprise us. He did not mention a charge for items out in the open. We were surprised when were billed for items we thought were complimentary. The small bag of potato chips below the TV was 2.50 in Pounds Sterling. That's $5.00 US. Don't eat or drink anything unless you are prepared to pay premium prices.Overall, we enjoyed our stay, though the hotel seemed more for business travelers than tourists."
123,679,Jun 3 2007 	Great Hotel Good Location	Nice hotel with clean spacious rooms that I was able to book on Hotwire for a very good price (especially for London). Location was good for getting places during the day with a Metro station across the street. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly in situating us in our rooms for an early check-in. The one potential negative for some travellers is that the hotel is located in the business district of London which on the evenings (and weekends) is pretty much deserted.
124,679,"May 11 2007 	Friendly Staff at Great Rate	Based upon user reviews, we booked this hotel using BA Holidays at 197 USD per night for 2 nights. We were very pleased with the hotel and breakfast buffet. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Although the Business Center was closed for the weekend, the concierge printed our boarding passes for us. It was a superior deal for the rate &amp; would definitely stay again."
125,679,"Apr 29 2007 	too expensive	i stayed at a corporate rate of 230 GBP- by no means a bargain in my book. I chose this location because i had a meeting next door the next day. the hotel is conveniently close to the tube but not in a great location for sightseeing. I used the little gym- which was OK. However, i find it really penny-pinching that one has to pay 15 GBP for in room internet usage- at this price this should be included. Otherwise it was a very anonymous,but efficient experience. would not stay here for pleasure."
126,679,"Apr 16 2007	Service with a personal touch	Service, service, service. Just spent the weekend at this marvelous hotel and it was great. I informed the staff by email that my wife was having her birthday and they got her a card signed by all the staff. We also got a free upgrade. The room was nice and spacious enough to have a sofa, desk and double bed in it. Bathroom was great as well and had a heated mirror.The location was also great right next to Saint Paul's and the Tate Modern bridge with good links to the underground. The only things I would have them improve on was the cooked breakfast (tomatoes &amp; mushrooms) tasted a bit funny and the potatoes were undercooked. The rest was delicious though. The view from the bedroom was also dissapointing as we looked over a massive air vent (still the upgrade outweighed this). Overall I would highly recommend this hotel simply for the amazing staff. Paid 50 pounds for the night with breakfast included."
127,679,"Apr 15 2007 	Fine apart from getting locked in the bathroom	Stayed for 2 nights with kids. Generally fine, and weekend price is reasonable. But there were faults with the room. Within minutes of arriving I was locked in the bathroom due to a broken latch, and although a nice engineer appeared within minutes of my husband calling reception it took him (and his crowbar) a while to get me out. A lamp in the bedroom was also not working, so I'm not sure how well things are checked/maintained.I'd have let them off the bathroom-lock incident if they'd apologised a bit more! But apart from the nice engineer chap I didn't get any apology. I tried emailing the hotel after we got back, but no reply. Maybe its just communications problems, but for an expensive hotel I would expect a bit more.Didn't try the breakfast as it wasnt included in rate, and places to eat for 1/4 the price nearby. The Italian restaurant was nice, though didn't include many kiddy-friendly dishes. Good location, and suitable rooms for families so probably still worth considering."
128,679,"Apr 15 2007 	Fantastic- five star service	This rates as one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in- the staff were extremely attentive and the rooms had so many fantastic little details that other hotels skip upon. The Breakfasts were fantastic, with a fantastic range of choice and no-one ever had to wait on the buffet being restocked. The location was superb offering a fantastic walk along the Thames to all central amenities such as the London Eye and Westminster and in the other direction St Pauls Cathedral, The Globe and The Tate Modern. The rooms were superb- extremely clean (and I am extremely fussy)- there was so much attention to the decor- sculptures in room, fantastic luxury toiletaries, complimentary tea/coffee tray with little extras, fantastic television and comfort, well sound proofed from both noises outside and inside. The bar was extremely modern and ideal for a queit drink. The lobby and lobby staff were exceptional. I tend to like to visit different hotels each time I go to same place- but this will be my primary choice when in London from now on."
129,679,"Apr 10 2007 	Theatre Break Weekend	The first piece of advise we would give anybody would be to research your HOTEL on trip adviser, we did and the Crowne Plaza was everything that we had expected.The Hotel has a quiet but very good location, conveniently placed opposite the Blackfriars underground station.The Thames is but a short walk from the hotel and has a lovely walk along the embankment.The hotel itself was immaculately clean, staff very friendly and helpful. You will not be disappointed at this hotel.Must see: Billy Elliot (Musical) at the Victoria Palace....brill."
130,679,"Apr 10 2007 	great location	Stayed in this hotel with my family including 2 children. The hotel website would not let me book a family room so i had to telephone their booking centre. They were very helpful and rang the hotel to confirm. We had a king studio room which had a king size bed, sofa bed, nice chairs and very modern. Nice bathroom all marble and molton brown toiletries. These did not get replaced during our 2 night stay. I thought this was a bit on the tight side and when i asked if i could have another shower gel for my family of 4 as one does not last 2 nights, they gave me a cheap alternative. I thought for the price of the room they would not be so mean over a bottle shower gel that was included in the price of the room. If a customer is used to luxury products they do not want to be fobbed off with a nasty alternative.It did cost 231 per night though. This is a bit pricey. However, we had access to the Club lounge and included free drinks and canapes. No free internet though as in the club lounge they had old computer and charged 5 per hour of internet. A bit cheeky considering that they charge so much for the rooms.We had breakfast at the hotel as again this was included in our rate. Normally it is a continental buffet breakfast in the club lounge. However, it was a weekend so served in the normal restaurant and included a hot buffet. It was not the quality i would personally expect of a hotel of this quality. We were shown to the table but not offered tea and coffee as a normal first. We had to wave the waiter over for this. I thought this was bad as other hotel restaurants offer this first. The food was in troughs and obviously mass prepared. No how do you want your eggs cooked here. There is a starbucks across the road but this closes of a weekend as did lots of the other food shops nearby. It was deserted. I would of course say this is a plus if you want a quiet relaxing break.The location of this hotel is good - walking distance to the river, tate modern, st pauls cathedral. If you get the tube use exit 8 at blackfriars and the hotel is a stones throw away. If you want somewhere nice to eat walk over blackfriars bridge and turn left and there are some lovely bars and restaurants. There is also a pizza express and cafe rouge and simply m&amp;s at st pauls and a few other eating places.The hotel reception was very plush, the staff very helpful and quick to maintain an excellent customer service. We discovered that we had no bedding in the room for the childrens sofa bed. We rang reception it was 10pm and they were very apologetic, returned our call to find out exactly what we needed and within 5 mins we had the bedding. Very good i thought."
131,679,"Apr 9 2007 	A Very Good Stay	Stayed here for 2 nights over the Easter Weekend. Booked a King Studio and was upgraded to a One Bedroom Suite. The room was relatively small for a suite and did not have a separate shower but we were very pleased overall.The room has a dvd player, a cd player and an i-pod player. The room was extremely clean and housekeeping offered a turndown service both nightsThe hotel itself was farily quiet as it is mainly a business hotel and this being Easter, the City of London was deserted. However, the tube station is right outside and the west end is 10 mins away.I would definitely return at the right price."
132,679,"Mar 21 2007 	Beat My expectations - Loved this Hotel	Stayed here with my wife and 2 small kids (5 &amp; 3). Was very nervous at first, because it had mixed reviews, but overall, had a great time!We stayed for only one night, but the room was spacious and very clean. It was very convenient to the Underground (literally right outside the door), which made sightseeing simple. The staff was very friendly and helpful, concierge helped me several times with taxi service, and other miscellaneous items. My family and I would definately stay here again."
133,679,"Mar 8 2007 	Excellent Experience	Stayed here on 1 March using points. Welcomed back from friendly receptionist. Hotel had allocated a double room on the club floor, requested a twin and was upgraded to a junior suite, including breakfast and entry to club (complimentary snacks and drinks). The bar was friendly and lively. Breakfast was very good.Overall excellent quality and service will definitely return."
134,679,"Mar 6 2007	Classy Hotel	I cashed in a few thousand Priority Club points for a 2-night weekend stay here with my girlfriend. Check in was efficient and Silvia upgraded me to a Club Room (6th floor) and told me that breakfast was included. The room was spacious and clean, but the old-style non-widescreen CRT TV seems a little out of place these days. There was also a radio and DVD player. The bed was very comfortable, and the hotel was nice and quiet - no issues with banging doors etc.The Club Lounge was small but pleasant, with free drinks.Breakfast was a reasonable buffet, but surprisingly less of a selection than some Holiday Inn's I have stayed at.This hotel oozes quiet and efficient professionalism - the staff are all excellent. Although a little out of the centre, this hotel is ideal for a quiet but very comfortable weekend break."
135,679,"Feb 20 2007 	Not bad at all	Stayed at the Crowne Plaza in order to visit TheatreLandThe CP is a nicely located hotel on the banks of the Thames and extremely close to Blackfriars tube station.On entering the hotel, you are greeted with a very nicely decorated foyer. The reception staff were both efficient and friendly (Erika is a credit to the hotel) although it was not particularly busy when I arrived.We were given a room on the third floor. The room itself was spotlessly clean and had all the basic amenities you would expect in a London hotel. It was fairly small but well decorated and it was extremely quiet - this may have been because it was 'the city' at the weekend but nonetheless it was very welcome.The only downsides with the room were that the bed was TINY. It was a double bed but so small and very uncomfortably which meant neither myself or my wife got much sleep. Also the bath was tiny as well (i struggled to fit in it) and the hot water was lukewarm at best.I didnt explore the bar / restaurant so cant comment on these.All in all it was an ok stay. I paid 80 for the night which in London is pretty good so I dont have much to complain about. I guess you could say this hotel was average."
136,679,"Feb 11 2007 	Truly excellent	This was my first time staying in the Crowne Plaza London City. Given that there was quite a lot of snow that morning ( February 8th February ) I was delighted to find the hotel directly opposite Blackfriars station.Despite the early hour, there was no quibble about checking in and having a coffee in the Club Lounge whilst rooms were being prepared. However, there was a heart stopping moment when there was a query about my reservation, and there didn't appear to be any room at the inn!!A very helpful manager (Kati) sorted the matter, which was down to no more than human error. She very kindly upgraded me to a studio room and offered a complimentary lunch. It is so rare to find this sort of attitude in a large hotel chain, and it did wonders in restoring my spirits.The Studio room has a dining table, desk and sofa bed, as well as a very comfortable king bed. The bathroom was nicely finished with and came with Molton Brown toiletries.As well as the usual tea facility, there was a coffee maker (no instant here!) with biscuits, and complimentary wine and nuts.The room was very bright and was supremely comfortable, so much so that I was reluctant to leave for my appointment in Westminster that evening.The Club Lounge is small but very cosy, and has complimentart internet access &amp; printing. I was pleasantly surprised to fine evening canapes still available on my return at 9.30pm. Just what was needed after being out in the cold!I would definitely stay in the Crowne Plaza London City again, and have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone."
137,679,"Feb 7 2007	It's fine. Not great just fine	Stayed at this hotel for just a quick Saturday night and found it OK, but not particularly great.The good news is that its location, just across the river from the Oxo Tower, is great; and the rooms - while not large - are still a good size and easily large enough to contain two double beds.Admittedly, we were in a standard room and we were there at the weekend (which is a very quiet time in The City) but when you arrive there in the evening and find the bar closed at just after 10pm and replaced by a one-man drinks service in reception - which meant it took over 15 minutes to take our order, despite the fact we were the only ones there - it doesn't bode well.The room-service menu was 24x7 and the mini-bar, while exhorbitantly priced (but isn't that standard) was well packed. All in all, room clean, beds quite comfortable and bathroom contained 3 Milton Brown extras that were welcome.One word of warning - at the front of the hotel there's massive building work going on (see the attached photo). Fortunately at the weekend there was no noise at all, but it could be something to bear in mind if you're going to be there mid-week and need your sleep. Make sure you ask for a room towards the back!Overall, I wasn't too impressed and for roughly the same price (particularly discounted off Priceline) I'd recommend the Victoria Park Plaza far more strongly."
138,679,"Jan 31 2007 	Perfect hotel on a perfect city	We're from Brazil and booked this hotel from British Airways Holidays for the New Years Holidays. Since our check-in, our experience was really great. Perfect !!! They provide us an early check-in. The bell cap, Karol, was so kind and helpful with us. The room was in perfect condition. Very clean atmosphere, with new furnitures and modern amenities. Perfect beds, excellent breakfast, very close to Blackfriars Tube Station. It was a perfect hotel for this perfect city !!!"
139,679,"Jan 2 2007 	Very Highly Recommended	Had a lovely stay New Years Eve. Staff could not have been better, very friendly and helpful. Nice rooms, very comfortable with everything you need and superb location. Lovely short walk to St Pauls where you should climb to the top to get your London bearings (not for the very unfit though!). Really nice breakfast and lovely contempory bar for late night drinks, and not rip-off prices. Really highly recommended, will stay again."
140,679,"Dec 3 2006 	Can't be faulted - Fantastic stay	Although I live in London, I needed somewhere to get dressed for the annual company christmas party (held nearby on the Thames) and somewhere to stay after the party on a Friday night. Aware of how expensive central London hotels are, I decided to use up some of my Priority Club points... I was very lucky at short notice (same day) I was able to redeem points for the Crowne Plaza - London The City.The hotel is very easy to find, and is a few steps away from Blackfriars tube station (make sure you use the exit for Ludgate Circus). The check in was very efficient. Tomasz was friendly and quick, and most importantly upgraded me to a Club Level room - in recognition of my Platinum status on Priority Club. I was offered a choice of complimentary Saturday newspaper and a wake up call. On arrival in my room, I was called by the Club Lounge receptionist to let me know I could contact her if I needed assistance.My room was up on the 6th foor (it's a seven story building), facing south (or the back of the Unilever building). Club levels (6&amp;7) can only be accessed in the lift after swiping your room key.The rooms are decorated in a modern style with a lot of dark browns and greys in the colour scheme. My room had a double bed, desk, leather desk chair and chair with footstool. The Club room has a widescreen TV (not LCD) and DVD player, also a mini radio/CD player. There were design books and selection of 4 magazines in the room. Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate (with a kettle and coffee percolator) and biscuits are available free, beyond that there's a well stocked minibar with sensors. Also on display are a jar of nuts and some praline chocolates (both chargeable).Plenty of hanging space in the cupboard, also an ironing board, iron - and safe big enough for a notebook computer.The bathroom is compact and has a shower and bath in one (some Crowne Plaza's have a seperate walk-in shower). Very clean, toiletries by Molton Brown (mouthwash, body lotion, shampoo, body wash gel, 2 x hand soaps). The shower is a good strength and is very hot.The curtains were blackout ones, allowing a well deserved sleep in after a boozy night at the christmas party. Currently construction work is happening across the road, and that's what woke me up. There was no turndown service. I wasn't bugged by staff, only just before the 12 noon checkout time - an attempt to check the minibar.I didn't get a good look or chance to use the hotel's common facilities, but I did pop into the club lounge (6th floor) for some canapes and a drink before heading out. Well stocked with drinks and tasty snacks. Bottle opener was tricky to find!!All in all - a great stay, and I woul definitely stay there again if I neede to be in that part of London."
141,679,"Nov 19 2006 	Top hotel	I got a good deal on a room here through GTAHotels.com, and it's now the hotel I check first when looking for a room in London. The location is excellent for sightseeing - a few seconds' walk from the Thames - and it couldn't be any easier to get to from the tube station, provided you get the right exit. Admittedly there's not a lot of nightlife in the immediate area, but that's probably a good thing if you're after a good night's sleep.The first room we were given had a distinctly nasty smell about it, but the receptionist gave us a different room with no questions asked and to be fair on the staff it took me a LOT of looking to find the source of the smell. The replacement room overlooked the atrium, which is a bit on the small side but still provides enough daylight, at least on the higher floors.Breakfast was pretty extensive and served usefully late into the morning. The eggs could possibly have done with another few seconds of cooking but otherwise the food was nice. We also tried the bar, which is classy with good service, but expensive.Overall I'm definitely looking forward to my next stay here."
142,679,"Nov 17 2006 	Convenient and comfortable	I received a warm welcome from the receptionist, who proceeded to check me in quickly. The room was very nicely furnished and reasonably spacious. As it was at the front of the hotel on the second floor there was some traffic noise, but this was acceptable and certainly not intrusive. Breakfast the next morning (included in the rate) was good. Overall a good experience"
143,679,"Nov 14 2006 	Lost our booking	I booked just under one month in advance on LastMinute with a very good rate (83). Upon arrival however I was informed they could not find the booking, despite the hotel phoning LastMinute to confirm that the booking had in fact been made.This resulted in a lot of stress, as the trip was a birthday surprise for my partner. However, the Manager on duty was quick in offering an alternative, staying at their sister hotel in St. James'. The taxi and a light meal was paid for, and I feel they did everything they could to resolve the issue quickly. There must have been a gap in communication somewhere along the line, and I can only advise to re-confirm your booking."
144,679,Oct 25 2006 	My favourite place	I am staying since 4 years on a regular (weekly) base in London. Have seen a lot of hotels. However have to say since one year I am a fan of the Crowne Plaza The City. Tube station in front of the hotel. The Thames river three minutes away.... and the nice design of the rooms and the public area...... my favourite place.
145,679,"Oct 25 2006 	Great Sight Seeing Hotel	The hotel is really well placed for sightseeing, particularly the South Bank attractions.Stayed in this hotel for one Saturday night in Oct. The hotel was really easy to get to right at exit 8 from Blackfriars Station. The hotel had a very modern feel, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.The room was very nicely appointed e.g. a selection of current magazines for both men and women. Very clean and very modern. The room had 2 double beds, fine for me and my family. The only down side was as I was on a room only deal we had to pay for breakfast which was 17 each with no child discount. We didn't eat there! If you come out the New Bridge St entrance, turn left and then right up Ludgate Hill towards St Pauls there is a cafe on the left which does a very nice breakfast with real freshly squeezed OJ etc where the whole family can eat for less than the price of one at the Hotel. I think it was called 'Ossie's'. Another tip...There is a restaurant under the OXO tower 10 mins walk away called Tamesa which does a pre theatre set menu up to 8 o'clock for 12. You get fantastic views of the river, the service was great as was the food, kid friendly but not a kids restaurant if you see what I mean.I will definitely stay here again."
146,679,"Oct 5 2006	great place!	I stayed here for 4 nights and had a great experience. Would definitely stay again if I got a good rate.Pros: -good location -- Starbucks is right across the street, as is Blackfriar's tube statation. There are some good restaurants closeby as well. -interesting, modern decor (at little *too* modern for my tastes, but that's personal preference)-spacious room and elegant bathroom-great amenities in the rooms, like kettles, hot chocolate, tea, coffee, cookies, bottled water; loved the Molton Brown toiletries!-friendly, welcoming staff-comfortable bedsCons:-expensive (but hey, it's London)-don't bother with the restaurant, especially for breakfast. Mediocre and not worth the money."
147,679,"Sep 26 2006 	Nice place	I have stayed in this hotel in the weekend that I go to the Vertigo concert in London Twickenham.We booked the deluxe room with breakfast at the IC website.The room was very clean and the staf was very helpful.The area of London City is very quit, but thats no probleme"
148,679,"Sep 25 2006 	Great if you get a deal	If you can manage to get a deal - official rates are too expensive, but hey, this is London - the CP London The City is a great place to stay at. Located two tube stops from Trafalgar Square (tube station Blackfriars is just out the door), it is withing easy reach of business and pleasure sites, but still in a reasonably quite location.Room quite big, comfy beds (except the pillows), bathroom nice but pretty small, with high quality amenities (Molton Brown).Breakfast is quite nice if it's included in your rate, but don't bother paying extra for it. In that case, grab a coffee at Starbucks across the street.Staff is extremele kind and helpful. E.g. when our confirmed non-smoking room smelled of smoke upon arrival, reception immediately solved the problem and got us another room within five minutes. All other members of staff i had to deal with were very kind as well.All in all, I'd stay here again anytime and recommend the hotel to anyone."
149,679,"Sep 15 2006 	Standard hotel shame about the service	Stayed on a Sunday night and got a very good rate from the ic hotels website. The girl that checked me in complained that the rate i had was not theri normal types of rates and suggested that I had altered it after i had booked. Showed her my Platinum Priority Club card and she told me they don't upgrade silver members only the gold ones. ( I get this a lot recently new staff not being aware that Platinum is higher than Gold) I was very annoyed so left and went to the room. It was a far size but as it was only on the first floor over a main road there was quite a lot of noise. The website for thsi hotel says you get molten brown stuff in the bathrooms but the staff told me they had run out and some rooms had the basic shower and bath stuff you find in a basic room in a normal holiday inn. I forgot to order my paper and went back down to reception and asked for a paper. I was made to feel liek a naugthy school boy as they told me they would add it on but it should have been done when I checked in. The breakfast was okay, at least they were able to cook their bacon and sausages to how i like them crispy. There were no fried eggs on the buffet and no signs to say how to get one.For my morning it was easy to get to the city from here either walk , bus or train from blackfriars station which is accross the road."
150,679,"Aug 29 2006 	Fantastic Value and the friendliest staff in London	I have just come back from a three night stay at the Crown Plaza (Blackfriars) and have had an absolutely wonderful time. The staff at this hotel have to be amongst the friendliest I have every encountered. They were extremely helpful and the impression given is that nothing is too much trouble. The hotel itself is clean and spacious. It also had the added benefit of being right next to Blackfriars tube station (exit8) on leaving the tube at this exit you are practically in the hotel reception.We booked this trip through holidayextras I never spoke to one person, yet all my tickets and reservations were amde and I didn't encounter a single problem.The package included 3 nights, theatre tickets and per theatre dinner for 400 which considering it's London I think is excellent value.Be aware though that a lot of the attractions in London are expensive, so be prepared to pay nothing short of 15 and above pp per attraction. MAKE SURE YOU BOOK THE ATTRACTIONS BEFORE YOU ARRIVE, if you don't you will spend most of your time in a queue. Thankfully we did book all the attraction we wanted on line, and I was so pleased when we seen the length of the queues.Definitely go on the Dinner Cruise, we booked through Bateaux Cruises, but I believe that City Cruises are the same. It cost 65 per person, but for that you get a four course meal, a cabaret show, disco and a welcoming drink; I don't think you'll find better value for money.The taxis are reasonably cheap so don't be frightened to use them, and you can buy an all day tube ticket for 4.90 which is a great way to get round the city.The highlight of the stay has to be the Nottinghill Carnival, it was fantastic and I would highly recommend this, the costumes the colours, the atmosphere, the noise, the people. I have travelled quite a bit and I have never come across something as wonderful as this carnival, I am booking up now for next year!"
151,679,"Aug 22 2006 	Superb quality	My wife and me have stayed for a week in this hotel in a pleasure trip. It is certainly a very male--designed, bussinessmen-orientated hotel, but for tourists looking for quality acomodation, as we were, it ranks very high. The situation is excellent, just in front of Blackfriars railroad station. The underground can't be nearer. Its situation in New Bridge Street is very convenient, just 5 minutes by tube to Westminster, and in less than half an hour you can walk through Fleet Street and Strand into Trafalgar Square. It has also very good bus combinations nearby.The total prize for seven days, including fantastic english breakfast, was 1050. Rooms are very comfortable, with very good disabled facilites, the fridge is very well furnished, and complimentary mineral water, tea and biscuits are offered every day. Excellent towels and bathrobe.The people working in the hotel are extremely kind and efficient. The customer service really reads your opinion and even answers. A small incidence with our credit card was fastly solved.My conclusion is a superb one, perhaps not the most romantic of London hotels, but a really comfortable and well-made one."
152,679,"Aug 21 2006	Great value our family loved it!	Just back from a one week visit to London, 2 adults, 2 children (boys, ages 7 and 11), we booked the Crowne Plaza through the British Airways website, it sounded like a good value (six nights at $214 a night, dollars, not pounds) and it was. We used our 1 week British Rail travel pass (good for all buses and tubes, all zones, best investment we did) to travel from Heathrow on the Piccadilly Line (changing at ActonTown, as a previous TripAdvisor had recommended) to the District Line to the Blackfriars tube stop. A few stairs out with the luggage but then the hotel was right there in front of us. We arrived late Saturday morning but a room was ready for us and we could check in. Very modern, clean, we had an interior courtyard view (no view) which was fine - VERY QUIET, Perfect! In fact, if we had been given a room across the hall we would have been watching (and hearing) a construction site, so request an interior room if you want quiet. One of the best deals was a full English buffet breakfast was included with our room rate, for all four of us. If we had walked off the street the charge would have been 17.5 pounds ($33) per person. Modern bathroom, good shower pressure. Good TV channels for the boys during non-sightseeing &quot;down&quot; time. The location was ideal, and since we had the travel pass, it was easy to take the tube or buses anywhere. We would definitely stay at this hotel again, particularly at such a good rate."
153,679,"Jul 29 2006 	Very nice for business or pleasure	Very well looked after - still very fresh and new - nice Molton Brown products and fluffy bathrobes in your room. Stylish bar but can be a bit noisy if you want to have a quiet chat. The Italian restaurant is great - very, very good food but not cheap - but you pay for what you get so....! If you can get a good deal on this hotel it is worth the money. Right next to Blackfriars underground station so you can get to anywhere in London very fast. Locality will be quiet on the weekends but as it is so easy to get around this should not be a problem."
154,679,"Jun 28 2006	Godd Value but quiet area	We stayed at this hotel in May 2006 for 4 nights. We booked a Standard room and as we were Priority Club Platinum members received a free upgrade to the Club Floor. We paid an extra 25 per night to upgrade one further to a Junior Suite at check in (rooms also known as Club King Studio Room).The main lobby of the hotel is very modern and bright and check-in was efficient with 6 members of staff on duty.The room was a good size with a super king size bed, a sitting area with sofa and arm chair, a working area with desk, double wardrobe and tea coffee making area.The bathroom was rather small and had no windows but was done in a modern style with marble and dark woods. The bathroom products are Molton Brown (personally don't like them but they are better than Crowne Plaza own brand!).There are two dressing gowns provided and a decent amount of towels.There is a large TV (not LCD or plasma) and also a DVD player and separate hi-fi unit.There are tea/coffee making facilities including a separate coffee percolator, extra filter coffee is available from housekeeping.The room supposedly has free internet available in the room using the Ethernet connection supplied or by using the keyboard connected to the TV, unfortunately neither worked in our room and after spending two hours with staff trying to fix it we gave up!All club rooms, junior suites/studio rooms and full suites entitle the occupants to use the club lounge which is located on the 6th floor.The lounge is a fair size with two sofas and a number of tables and chairs. There is a bar area with soft drinks available all the time free of charge and alcohol, spirits, wine and beer available after 1800hrs - 2100hrs when they also bring out some nibbles such as cheese and biscuits and a few canaps.Most days there are slices of cake available in the lounge in the afternoon although be sure to check them before you eat as two of the pieces I picked up had mould on them!There is a reception desk in this lounge and a member of staff is there in a morning from about 0700-1200hrs to assist with any problems you have.A continental breakfast is served in the lounge in a morning however at weekends this is served in the main restaurant instead.A selection of books, DVD's and CD's can be hired free of charge from the lounge and there is a PC with free internet connection (that works) however you will need to ask a member of staff for the password.Service in the hotel was fairly good; room service was prompt and fairly decent sized portions although the menu is typical hotel stuff, burgers, pizza etc.Try the home made fish cakes off the kids menu, perfect portion size for most adults and half the price.The hotel has a modern gym area with a small selection of new cardio equipment but no free weights. There is also a sauna and changing area. There was no one using the gym when I went down and you just swipe your room card to get in.The main problem we had with this hotel is that the area it is located in (directly opposite Blackfriars train station) is very quiet at night and at weekends because this is the financial district.You will struggle to find any shops or restaurants that area open in the area on a Saturday or Sunday (yes even Pret and Starbucks are closed on a Saturday!!!). However you are a very quick tube ride away from the west end or Victoria Station which has a large selection of shops and places to eat.The good thing with the hotel is that it is only a 5 min walk to St Pauls Cathedral, the Bank of England, Mansion House and the Financial District, 10 min to the London Museum. Or just walk across the road, jump on a tube (District and Circle Line) and you can be at the Tower of London in about 6 minutes or Westminster in about 4 minutes.The hotel is very close to Blackfriars Bridge and of course the river Thames but no views of the river from the hotel itself i'm afraid.Overall a good value (especially at weekends) hotel in a safe, quiet area but still well connected to all the areas you normally need."
155,679,"Jun 5 2006	Great Service...OK location	My husband and I stayed here from Friday to Sunday in May 2006. We had one of the club rooms. The sevice was great and the staff were so friendly and helpful. Especially Philippe and Claire. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants or had drinks in the bar so I can't say anything about those.The rooms were very clean and charming as is the bath room. However, it was smaller than I had expected, especially our bath room. As I said, we were on the club floor and had access to the club lounge. By the way, breakfast is not served in the club lounge on the weekends as it is on the weekdays. You can still use the lounge on the weekends but if you need anything, you will need to call down to reception and someone will come up to the lounge to help you. You can borrow DVDs and CDs from the lounge and you have a DVD player and CD player in your room. The loung also has free drinks (alchoholic beverages and snacks start around 18:00). The hotel is very close to a tube station (Blackfrairs) but otherwise is in a more business area. This means that on the weekend and evenings, it's dead. There is a Starbucks across the street so if you do miss the breakfast in the hotel, you can still get a quick fix at the Starbucks. Overall, a great hotel and wonderful, friendly, helpful staff. The Location could be better but we enjoyed our stay."
156,679,"Apr 8 2006	excellent	Just got back from London-Paris last weekend. Excellent hotel. Great location. Right next to the Blackfriar tube station so it was very convinient to go to all the sights. Since it is located in the financial district, the area is very quite at night and on the weekend, which my wife and I prefer since London is such as busy and crowded city like Tokyo. We got a superior room upgrade even though we book the hotel free using our priority club points. The room was large, very clean, nice modern decor, and a very nice bathroom. In room safe was also present, which is always a plus. They also give us free bottles of water everyday we stayed which is a very nice touch. The hotel staff, including the bell boy, was all very helpful and friendly. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in town:)"
157,679,"Apr 5 2006	Excellent Location Excellent Hotel	Have travelled to England about 15 times and this is the best hotel I have stayed at in London. It is directly across the street from Blackfriars tube and the location is central to everything. The rooms were modern, immaculately clean, quiet, and very attractive. The non-smoking rooms were actually truly non-smoking. I will definitely stay here again."
158,679,"Mar 19 2006	Nice Rooms / Expensive Extras	Stayed here over the weekend; faultlessly nice room / bathroom. Service was excellent, and it's very good for access too (exit 8 from Blackfriars practically leads into the hotel). On the downside, as a leisure traveller this was VERY expensive in terms of room service / breakfast / entertainment, etc. 10/movie, 17/buffet breakfast, 20/basic room breakfast, minibar was hilariously expensive [we didn't need to buy a movie as we were having too much fun checking the prices out]. The other slight downside, staying here over the weekend, since it's in the financial district everything is closed ALL DAY Saturday &amp; Sunday. So nice &amp; quiet then, if that's what you're after. By the way, we got it for $100 per night Priceline."
159,679,"Feb 20 2006	Pretty standard stuff....	Stayed at the Crowne Plaza last weekend, as part of a theatre package, booked online. Was obviously a good deal, as the prices advertised within the hotel were very high.We had a twin room which was clean and pleasant, but by no means five-star standard. I would go as far as to say that is was Travel Lodge standard with some nice sheets and a few ornaments! Couldn't believe the price of internet access, listening to albums and the vastly overpriced mini-bar and selection of snacks. I believe it's standard these days but, be aware that if you as much as pick up something from the mini-bar, it is automatically charged to your bill if not put back within 20 seconds. We picked up the small 3.95 jar of cashew nuts and then had to tell reception staff that we hadn't eaten them and could they be removed from our bill. I don't like being put in that position- I don't even like cashew nuts!!The hairdryer was a box-on-the-wall-with-a-tube one like you find in a swimming baths and my friend found it almost impossible to use as the tube part got so hot it burned her hand. For the price guests are paying, a proper hand held dryer would be nice.... Molton Brown stuff in the bathroom was lovely.Huge queue for breakfast and not enough staff on duty, but loads of choice and good quality food. Reception and general hotel staff are lovely, polite and helpful.Overall, my feeling was that it was not a five-star hotel in many ways but pleasant enough and well located, particularly for the Tate Modern and St Pauls Cathedral."
160,679,"Jan 19 2006	First league!	We stayed at the CP-The City for two nights over the weekend. As PC Plat. Ambassador we got an upgrade to one of their beautiful club rooms. The lounge service is limited over the weekend but still on an acceptable level. Very stylish and warm hotel. Excellent staff. Tube station and bus stop are a step away, a pub is across the street and many nice and affordable restaurants are nearby. The nicest CP I know (a disguised InterContinental)."
161,679,"Nov 9 2005	Flawless	The perfect location. My room was wondefully appointed and the staff went above and beyond. This hotel is number one on my list for hotels in London. From the sleek martini to bar to front of house staff who were friendly, efficient and went out of their way to make my stay memorable. I consider myself a seasoned traveller and would highly recommend this hotel!"
162,679,"Aug 30 2005	Fantastic hotel!	We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Crown Plaza - the City. We absolutely LOVED it. We stayed on the Club level, and it's far worth the difference in price. Unlike most everyone else, we found the breakfast to be truly good (this what included in the Club room charge, and was provided by the restaurant Belugo - so it may be different). Also, it was over the weekend. The hotel is very clean, and in a great location. The thing that impressed me the most about this hotel was the staff. We didn't come across a single staff member that was unpleasant. Almost all of them went out of their way to help us - especially when I woke up incredibly sick one morning. I highly recommend this hotel, and will most definitely stay there again. **If you are traveling to the hotel from Heathrow - a quick piece of advice. Take the tube. It takes about an hour from the airport, but costs less than 4 GBP (a taxi will take almost as long for 55 GBP). Take the Picadilly line (blue), to the District line and change at Acton Town. You will literally only have to hop across the platform to get on the District line. If you wait til some of the other stations, then you may have to climb up and down steps with your luggage. Trust me, I learned this the hard way! Then take the District train to the Blackfrairs station, and use exit 8. The hotel will be directly in front of you. There's a few steps while exiting at Blackfrairs, but not terrible."
163,679,"Jun 28 2005	Great Hotel - Pity about Breakfast	I agree with other comments, but like visitor in May 2005 found the breakfast disappointing. Great to discover, then, round the corner at the far end of Tudor Street, the AM breakfast buffet bar open from 5am!! Great service, great food, great price."
164,679,"Jun 20 2005	Lovely hotel a pleasure to stay in	We loved this hotel - got a great online rate mid-week. It's one minute from Blackfriars station, and an easy walk to St Pauls, Strand, Covent Garden etc. Very smart, contemporary rooms, comfortably, with friendly staff. Would stay there each time I go to London if I could get a good rate!"
165,679,"Jun 6 2005	Very pleasant indeed	Truly unexpected experience. The hotel sites right on the tube line and is very centrally located only one block from the Thames River. From the moment I walked in I was impressed. Very updated and modern decor. The staff was very polite and friendly, not to mention very helpful. The underground was down that day and they helped me find the right buses to take me to my destinations. Very professional indeed. Being a weekend and that the hotel is in the financial district, I was given a free upgrade to the Club Floor (7th floor). This was a very nice room. Very upscale and polished. Probably the nicest bathroom of all, far better than any Hilton/ Hyatt or Fairmont I have stayed in. The room had internet access with a keyboard and all the amneties you would expect and then some (robes, slippers, CD/DVD player, iron and even a machine that presses your slacks in a few seconds in the armoir. I payed 120.00 US on priceline and it was so much nicer than anything else I found for that price range..I am not sure what the other floors/rooms were like, but the Club Floor is very refined. Would very much recommend this hotel."
166,679,"Jun 3 2005 	Great hotel and great staff	I am a regular visitor to London and have stayed at just about all the InterCon's, Holiday Inn's and Crowne Plaza's in London. I have to say that I was very, very impressed with the hotel.It is next to Blackfriars tube/Thameslink which is very handy if you are travelling into the City from Gatwick. It is also relatively easy to walk into the City and St Pauls is only a short walk away. For those of you that like Starbucks (I do) there is one directly across the road from the hotel.There was only one person at Check-in at 7pm and the receptionist was almost done with another customer and I had only to wait a minute or two. She apologised for keeping me, which I thought was a nice touch. If it had been several minutes, yes, but a couple. Good start.I had been upgraded to a Club Level room (that Platinum Elite Priority Card does come in handy) and given access to the Club lounge. It has a nice view out towards the Thames and has a great selction of beers as well as soft drinks and wine. The breakfast in the morning, although not a huge selection was good and tasty.My room faced out towards the back of the hotel away from the main road. There were huge oversized pillows which are great to watch TV with as they give great support (although there was a comfy chair for that as well!) and were comfortable for sleeping.Bed and bedding were excellent as was the air con (although a little noisy) which for me was set at artic as I'm from Scotland and I prefer it cool.Bathroom had a great shower and nice Molton Brown shower gel and other goodies. Lots of nice, fluffy towels and bathrobes. The shower had a nice glass panel rather than a shower curtain and I am sure that anyone who travels a lot and has done battle with creeping shower curtains will appreciate a power shower without having to fight off the curtain.I had a couple of meetings in the City and I was able to easily arrange late check-out which was handy. Finally, I managed to forget my mobile. I noticed about 20 minutes later and when I went back to the hotel, expecting it to have walked, it was actually all wrapped up and at reception.If that is not impressive service what is? Well worth staying here and I will certainly be back."

1,686,"Nov 7 2009 	Clean Friendly Good Value for Money	Stayed from 2nd to 6th November for a week long meeting / conference near Marylebone. The hotel was really easy to get to from either Paddington (3 min walk) or Edgware Road (8 min walk). I had a single room which was not big, but it had a bigger than single bed. VERY clean. Lovely warm powerful shower. The only thing I could have done with was a desk to do some work which was all taken up with the tea/coffee making facilities. Breakfast was a nice choice of continental breakfast (all cold) but I wasn't there for fine dining. THe staff were all really polite and helpful. I would definitely stay here again."
2,686,Oct 18 2009 	DISGRACEFULL CUSTOMER SERVICE	We arrived at the hotel on a Friday and were accommodated to our rooms which were small but fine. We were rudely awoken in the middle of the night by guests that had been allowed to check in with alcohol and a music player. We got absolutely no sleep for the entire night. The night staff phoned the noisy room and the party went on into the early hours of the morning. Eventually at 7am after a night of no sleep we called reception again and got lies told to us by many members of staff. The staff were unfriendly and very unhelpful. There was no manager around for the week and nobody in charge. I would advise people not to stay here EVER. The service was appalling the staff were very very rude. Maybe because it is in a decent location they feel they don't need to serve their guests well.
3,686,"Oct 10 2009 	Good time in London	Would recommend booking in advance to get a good discount as I would not pay what someone had asked while I was at reception, 130quid no chance. Checked in fine and was told breakfast included for 82.50 which I thought was very good value for Hyde Park, breakfast was nice but couldn't understand why they stopped doing a full english when in England???.Rooms are small but adequate. Girlfriend complained of bed bugs and shower flooded so could not stay in it for too long. They have a bar and the guys at recepton are quite helpful with things going on. Stayed here for one night but would not stay here for a week. All in all was good couple of days in London recommend hotel for short stays."
4,686,"Oct 5 2009 	Good location bad room terrible service	Recently stayed at the Days Hotel London Hyde Park for 2 nights. Positives: The location is fantastic, close to metro &amp; on a main line so very easy to go anywhere. Breakfast was ok, self service, no frills but kitchen ladies were nice. Also, the shower was good &amp; strong water pressure. Now, let me tell you about my overall stay:On Tuesday, i booked a double room online. On wednesday, i rang &amp; changed the room to a triple as my sister decided last minute to come with us. The receptionist on the phone was helpful, changed the room type &amp; told me the extra cost. On Thursday, i rang again- just to confirm the booking as we were arriving late that night. We arrived at the hotel- only to be told that our room was a 'double'. Our changed booking &quot;was not on the system.&quot; After he 'ummmm'ed' &amp; 'aaaahed' he finally told us there was a triple available &amp; gave us the keys. Off we went, but when we opened the bedroom door- there was somebody else in the room already! Back downstairs, the receptionist didnt believe us &quot;its not possible, it is not on the system&quot; he said. But the bedroom was locked from the inside &amp; there was a man shouting out at us! So, they apologised &amp; allocated us another room. Now, i had read heaps of other reviews of hotels in general in London, and so, was execting the rooms to be small, but nice &amp; clean. Our room, 406, was up in the attic. it did not look like ANY of the photos i had seen previously. The ceiling was sloped so you could not stand upright at one side of the double bed (nor was there enough room to walk around the bed) The floor was on a slant- so the bedside lockers &amp; the bed were on a slope. (things were rolling off the bedside locker!) The bathroom door did not open fully- as it opened against the bed. The duvet covers were all ripped. The floor was in need of a decent hoover. The bed was comfortable enough, although there were no sheets-only the heavy duvet. There was a window which opened fully but due to the noisy traffic, we had to close it at night time (my cousin lives in Dublin city &amp; she found the street noise unbearable) and so the room was EXTREMELY HOT &amp; very difficult to sleep! Also, we asked for late check out on Sat morning, as we were going to a show fri night &amp; knew we'd be out late. We were told this was fine, however we were all disturbed early when the cleaning lady knocked, and walked right into our room! Lucky we had the inside lock on. (we also had the 'do not disturb' sign on the door!) Reception rang us then at 11.30 to tell us that check out was at 11 &amp; we would be charged extra as we were late. We explained that we'd asked for late check out, however this &quot;was not on the system&quot; Overall, there seems to be NO COMMUNICATION whatsoever between ANY of the staff, and obviously their &quot;system&quot; isnt working. I spent hours researching hotels online &amp; truely thought i'd found a good one, but really, the Days Hotel Hyde Park, does not deserve the good ratings. I assure you, i'm 26yrs of age &amp; have recently travelled around Australia in hostels etc so i am not a princess. I wasnt expecting alot, but surely, there are nicer places to stay at without all the stupid drama.....surely!"
5,686,"Sep 28 2009 	Very Good Hotel	This hotel is in a great location especially for the Paddington and Edgware Road underground stations. Although the rooms are small, they are clean and well equipped. I was also impressed by the manner and excellent service of the Reception staff. Will definitely book this hotel again."
6,686,"Sep 18 2009 	EXCELLENT HOTEL LOVELY ROOMS AMAZING STAFF	wow - What a lovely hotel! Way beyond my expectations being a 'Travelodge' person usually. I am now spoilt. Yes, it cost more but what a difference! A beautiful building in a prime location (we were going to The Proms In The Park at Hyde Park and the hotel is about a10 minute stroll away)The staff are excellent, very professional. So helpful! The room was lovely - our ONLY complaint about the whole trip was that the hotel is on main road and no double glazing made it pretty noisy.The breakfast was lovely - full English (self-service) and they even kept our bags (FOR FREE UNLIKE T/L who charge 10) as we were checking out a couple of hours before our train was due and didn't want to be carrying them around London with us.Thank you - we had a lovely time!"
7,686,"Sep 14 2009 	Will definitely stay here again	I stayed at the Days Inn Hyde Park twice over the past couple of weeks: Sept 2 through 4th and then from Sept 8 through 10th. I have stayed there a couple of previous times.For my first stay I was put into a single room- small, clean and adequate. For my second stay I was put into a double- still small byu North American standards, but it was roomier.The staff is friendly and professional. Breakfast was a little disappointing these past two visits as the&quot;full English&quot; was not quite &quot;full&quot; ie. no sausages. A small item as there was definitely lots to eat.I will definitely be staying there again. I enjoy staying in the Paddington area and the hotel is only a couple of minutes easy walk from the station. During these visits, and my visit in February, I was able to get into my room as soon as I arrived- before noon. Much appreciated."
8,686,"Aug 22 2009 	If you can't stand the heat ..... part 2.	Stayed on business for several nights and can reinforce the previous review... my tiny room was fine apart from it being extremely hot and stuffy which resulted in virtually no sleep over the period. I was given a fan which didn't help much, and opening the windows made sleep even harder due to the 24hr traffic and noisy late night pedestrians. Its a shame because the hotel staff were helpful and the room itself was clean and modern.So in summary :-The good - Helpful staff. Modern room. Clean room.The ok - Adevrtised cable tv was 5UK channels, sky news, and a few foreign channels. Chargeable Internet. Breakfast.... adequateThe bad - Unbearably hot, stuffy, small room"
9,686,"Aug 11 2009 	If you can't stand the heat don't stay in this hotel!	This hotel does not have A/C, and some rooms are in a courtyard where it is impossible to have the small window open for some ventilation as people pass by to go to their room. The hotel doesn't have enough fans for all the rooms, and it was only after much protesting that they managed to find me one, which I had to carry to my room. Even so, the heat was too much for me and I decided to abandon all attempts to sleep in the room. As the staff readily admitted, they're just not geared up to hot weather (and it wasn't particularly hot the night I stayed!). Breakfast is good, and unusually for most central London hotels is included in the price. But the rooms are small and the en suite feels like it is inside a cupboard (seems to be standard for Days hotels in the UK). I wouldn't risk staying here again although I admit it is usually cheaper than the nearby Hilton or Novotels (but the standards are not comparable!). 1 hour internet access costs 5, although you can have 24 hrs for 10."
10,686,"May 22 2009 	will stay there again	Loved it! In a central location, a very short walk to main train stn/Paddington. Could get everywhere from there. There were numerous places to eat within walking distance. Even though it was in central London, is was very peaceful and green where the hotel was located. The staff was very friendly and helpful. the room was minsicule by american standards, but that added to the thrill of being a first time visitor to London. Besides that we were only in the room to sleep. My daughter, age 23, griped about the breakfast, and I didn't care for beans and stewed tomatoes for that meal, but there were enough other selections- cereal, fresh fruit, toast and jelly, to satisfy. The ham in particular was very good, like ham here in Virginia. And I would love to see those machines with coffee, chocalate and cafe mocha at the push of a button here in the states. No complaints from me, and I plan to stay there again."
11,686,"Apr 16 2009 	Excellent value for money	This hotel is a great find in London - good value, clean and comfortable. The rooms aren't massive, but they never are in central London hotels, and I have stayed at many hotels where the size of the room itself, and bathroom are MUCH worse. At least this place is spotlessly clean, and has friendly staff and a good breakfast. For the price, it's the best place I've stayed in London."
12,686,"Mar 28 2009 	Great Value!	My husband and I were in London en route to Edinburgh. We spent two nights at Days Inn, Hyde Park and were delighted with the place. Though the rooms are small they are great value -- spotlessly clean, well equipped with anything you might need, very friendly staff (a special thanks to Abhinav!), fairly convenient location, and a substantial breakfast with enough vegetarian options. Hyde Park is five mintues away if you want to stretch your legs and breathe deep. I would recommend this to other budget travellers who want a clean place and central location -- Paddington is about 5-7 mins walk even with luggage, conveniently situated for both tube travel and trains. May be too cramped for those travelling with kids, though."
13,686,"Mar 23 2009 	Snug but clean with great location!	I was one of several thousand people &quot;stuck&quot; in London during the biggest snowstorm in 20 years the beginning of February. Days Hotel was such a great deal and in a great location for me to spend my two days stranded in London. The staff was extremely kind and very helpful. The 24-hour reception made me feel safe and I was greeted warmly every time I came back, even after a late night West End show. The free breakfast was good (variety of breads, toast, eggs, bacon, beans, yogurt, cheese, fruit, variety of juices, hot cocoa, etc.) and the location in a quiet neighborhood just a 3 minute walk from Paddington Station was perfect. Paddington station has many restaurants as well as two grocery stores which makes eating out and stocking up for the day very convenient. The room was a bit snug. Funny enough I stayed in room 109 of which there is a picture in the photo gallery. For a single traveler like me, it was just fine and fit my minimalist style (no overstuffed, ugly seating that I would never use). When I return to London, I will definitely use this hotel again."
14,686,"Feb 13 2009 	Cramped dirty cold shower	Stayed here for one night. Booked a single but was upgraded to a double.The bedding was clean. The carpet was filthy. It couldn't have been vacuumed for a long time and the stairs and public carpets were dirty too.The room was very cramped and I had to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the bed, window and wardrobe.There was no hot water in the morning for my shower. And the ensuite was so small that anyone over a UK dress size 12 would struggle to maneouvre.Breakfast seemed ok. I just had toast and tea but there was plenty of food on offer, usual greasy breakfast, yoghurts, bread rolls, apples, toasts and jams etc"
15,686,"Jan 3 2009 	Excellent value hotel	Great hotel, close to Paddington train and Metro station with convenient bus links to central London. Clean, quiet hotel with a quirky layout (being made up of adjoining houses). Good service, great &quot;full English&quot; breakfast. Recommended."
16,686,Dec 14 2008 	Excellent Location and Value for money!	I chose this hotel for its excellent location next to the Paddington tube station as I was planning to do some shopping and museum browsing in central London.....the price and location combo...made me go for it and I was not disappointed as though I found the rooms slightly small (as it is a london property that was to be expected...) teh rooms were clean and with kettle for tea and coffee and a clean shower room. The only drawback is that they do not have a left luggage facility...will stay again excellent value for money!
17,686,"Nov 1 2008 	avoid	we booked into this hotel in person the day before we wanted the room. the man on the desk couldn't speak english very well but he was friendly and he saved me the triple room (which i was not able to view) for my husband and me, our baby(requiring a cot) and a 5 year old, with my credit card. the next day we all turned up to be told he had booked the room for the following night... 2 kids and suitcases in tow this was not what we wanted to hear! After my husband got very angry they said they'd got a family room we could have - it should cost 155 but they'd let us have it for 125.Without much choice we took it. we weren't able to check in until later in the day so we went around london and came back in the wintery pouring rain that evening to find our room was in the basement and it was really a double room with 2 double beds and a single squeezed in. there was no room for anything else, so i had no chance of getting a cot which is what the baby needed. too late and cold to start searching elsewhere we had to make do.The carpet was filthy - the dust was thick on it, along with various sweets that past children had lost, god knows how long they'd been there. i had to hunt around in the dust to pick them up incase my baby found them. the bathroom was clean but needed work to fill in chipped tiles etc. it was the size of a pin and just a tiny shower, no bath. After showering my husband had to get dried in the cramped bedroom there was no room in the bathroom.the view from the window was a pile of rubbish in the stairwell coming straight off sussex gardens which is a very busy road. the security in the room was terrible.the breakfast was okay, run of the mill buffet.we travel a lot and this was certainly the worst accommodation we ever had for the family. If it had been half the price it may have just been acceptable (except the floor dirt) but 155? Don't do it!"
18,686,"Oct 30 2008 	Very small but okey	This was our first time in London. We did choose this hotel among three others. The reason was that we had got a special offer. So we did read rewievs on tripadvisor. The hotel is located near subway Paddington and there is a couple places to eat at near by. There is local bars, chinese and fast food. It is quite easy to travel from Gatwick to this hotel by train. Staff was okey but we had some problems to communicate with them. It was very small rooms but It was okey. The bathrooms were even smaller. Some rooms are placed near the stairs which means you have to carry your bagage upstais or downstairs. There are rooms that you can't go to by elevator. My parents got a room that was very hard to find behind an unmarked door.In the room there was a safe that didn't work. We talked to the staff and they said that I can't be used. It was hard to get any other answer then that, insted they gave us a second key to the door !The don't have a bagage room insted you have put it behind the bar. It didn't feel safe at all because it was a door that was open and the staff couldn't see the bagage from the reception.Breakfast, you have an english section and some bread, tea, coffee, yoghurt and some apples. Not much if you don't like the english one but I eat a lot of bread, tea and apple. If you have a tight budget you can choose this hotel. If you don't mind the small rooms and small breakfast. Next time I come to London I will choose another hotel."
19,686,"Oct 9 2008	Cute 	Cute Hotel!Very Small Room...But that was okay!Private BathroomWell Priced in Comparison to everything else I found. 3 minute walk to train stationnice staff, very helpful!"
20,686,"Sep 23 2008	Functional not fancy...it's a Days Inn after all	We had originally booked another hotel, but when I found the Days Inn Hyde Park for 85 pounds a night, a savings of over $600 for the week, we decided to take a chance. The location is 2 short blocks from Paddington station. Very convenient. There are a number of restaurants and lively pubs in the area, as well as convenience stores and the ever-present fast food places. Hyde Park is close, for after dinner strolls. Yes, the rooms are small, as they are in an old narrow Victorian building. We had a triple, and there was not a lot of walking room around the beds. From looking at the plan of our floor, though, there did appear to be 2 sizable rooms, which I assume are the quads, or family suites. The bathrooms are extremely tiny as well, which made shaving in the shower somewhat of a challenge. Yes, the walls can be thin, as we found out when our neighbor decided to sleep with the tv on all night. But everything was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and breakfast was good. We spent very little time in our room anyway. If you are concerned with luxury, you'll want to stay away, but if you want a decent budget-priced place to stay, this hotel should meet your needs."
21,686,"Sep 1 2008 	Fairly Positive	This hotel is excellent with regards to location. It is located near two underground lines and has several bus lines running in the area. There are many resturants to choose from nearby and it is within walking distance to just about anything you'd want to see. The staff was helpful and friendly. The breakfast hours were reasonable. Coming from America, there were clear cultural differences regarding what we typically expected in a hotel, (i.e. larger rooms, air conditioning, mints on pillows, etc.) but we were rarely in the room, so it did not matter. Overall, this was a nice little hotel for a fair price."
22,686,"Jul 26 2008 	Redefined the ""tiny"" and the ""clean""	We reserved this hotel two months in advance, based on the availability of the rooms for two adults and a youngster (11 years), reviews on Tripadvisor and travel agent search for similar accomodations.The location is great, the area nice, but the hotel itself is sub-standard, even for London. The first room we were shown was basically two beds divided by a 50 cm free space. Needless to say that there is not even a place to put the suitcase, and we have two of those.We asked for a different room, and were given a slightly bigger one, though the so-called double bed was only 120cm wide. There was even a small hall before the bedroom with a door, which we found very important later on. The bathroom was so tiny, that one had to open the door to the hall to be able to wipe oneself. The water in the shower took half an hour to set to a suitable temperature, while the sink tap gave us half-hot half-cold combination, as if there was two different taps.During the 6 nights in this hotel, the vacuum cleaner never appeared in our room at all. The bathroom was cleaned, the towels changed - and this is all. The dust on the carpeting was not cleaned for weeks. And when I called to ask for the new soap container - I was told to go to the reception to fetch it myself.But the last day was the &quot;best&quot; of them all. We left the luggage in the lobby (there is no storage space), and when we came back to fetch it, we found out that there is not even a toilet in the lobby area.I ask you: &quot;Is this the 3 stars?&quot; I won't give them even one star. And all this for 130 pounds a night.I strongly recommend to look elsewhere for a stay, unless you like tight spaces, dusty rooms and bad plumbing."
23,686,"Jul 22 2008 	Good location old plumbing	Good location, close to Lancaster Gate, Paddington and Marble Arch. The rooms are small, but OK considering London economic hotels standards. Very clean. Bathroom ok, but we had some issues with the shower. During the morning, we had no hot water in shower for many times, apparently, the plumbing is not sufficient for filling all bathrooms, sometimes we had to wait for 5 minutes, shampooed, for hot water. Good breakfast. Overall good value for money (we paid around GBP 105 per night)."
24,686,"Jul 22 2008 	Reasonable value nice breakfast	We stayed here for one night and found it to be really nice. Finding decent hotels in London can be a mare but this one turned out fine. The room was a reasonable size although the bathroom was titchy, it was spotlessly clean and freshly decorated. The breakfast was quite good, although no sausage with the cooked breakfast, and you could have as much as you wanted. My only negative was that the sound proofing seemed quite poor in our room anyway, although there wasn't excessive noise from any of the other guests.The location is great, very close to Paddington station, there's lots of pubs and cafe/restaruants around and Hyde Park is just a short walk away."
25,686,"Jul 13 2008 	Quant	Lovely, very clean, but small hotel. We had to put our suitcases on our bed when we were up and about. Bathroom was tiny also. But the price and the convenience of this hotel was well worth it. Within an easy 2 minute walk to Paddington Station. Felt safe walking around the neighborhood. We would be out at midnight and up at 530AM too."
26,686,"Jun 30 2008 	First Impression	We booked our hotel about a week prior via a website and found such a great deal. However, you get what you pay for. The room was VERY small for two people to move around in and barely room to store large suitcases. The bathroom was also very small but clean. We would most likely stay again however ask for a bigger room. The hotel was very clean and the staff were both helpful and friendly. About an 8min walk from Paddington Station. Same items fo daily breakfast but good to start the day with. Many great pubs and restaurants within walking distance as well as little shops to pick up snacks."
27,686,"Jun 21 2008 	Lovley small hotel in Sussex Gardens	Good location, nice hotel! We enjoyed our stay at the hotel, short walk from Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate. Good value for money! This is our hotel in London.......... Good brekfast and service. The rooms was a bit small same with the bathroom, but it was nice and clean."
28,686,"Jun 9 2008 	Good Breakfast close to the Tube.	This is a very convenient hotel located north of Hyde Park very close to Paddington station. We were very pleased when at the last minute the hotel staff allowed us to check in a day early. The rooms are small but adequate with decent beds and storage. The bathroom was clean but tiny - I am 6'4&quot; and was able to use it okay - but it is far from roomy. We went to London for the sight seeing and spent very little time in the room. We were excited about the prospect of a full breakfast and that is exactly what we got! The breakfast is good with fresh eggs and bacon every morning. When we were the first down for breakfast they even asked us how we liked our eggs. Other hot drinks, toast, cereal, yogurt, juice, cheese etc...were all provided. We wanted to start each day with full bellies and this was perfect. Nice big space with lots of tables and the news on a large tv etc... very nice breakfast area with good food! I would rate the hotel excellent if the bathrooms were a touch bigger! We would stay again for the price, breakfast, and short walk to the tube! Mind the gap - Paddington station is a great place to catch multiple lines less than 10 minutes from the hotel. Decent restaurant choices near by with a pub on the corner too. We enjoyed the Fish N Chips next to the pub. Everything was lovely."
29,686,"May 28 2008 	Stayed for the location	I needed somewhere cheap and with close access to Paddington Station for a couple of nights. The Days Inn fit the bill. I had read the mixed reviews and was expecting worse than what I found. The registration desk area is small, so if more than a few people are checking in it can be crowded. All of the front desk people I delt with were pleasant. I booked a single room for less than $125 a night (VAT incl). Yes the room was small, but I had anticipated that. It was very clean. As mentioned in the last review, the room was overly warm.... ok it was hot. Being on the 3rd floor, it was not a problem to open the window. London street noise puts me to sleep, so it wasn't a problem. Most of the reviews seem pretty accurate. It depends on your expectations. You get what you pay for."
30,686,"Apr 2 2008 	Good location poor service and size	Stayed here with my partner for three nights. The location was excellent with Paddington station a few minutes walk away, the room was clean, but unfortunately these factors were really the only positives. Our room was unbearably hot, almost like a sauna. When we complained to reception we were told firstly that they would notify management. When there was no change, we were then told that the heating was controlled generally for the building and not each individual room, and apparently, which we did not believe, other guests had said it was too cold. We were forced to sleep on top of the sheets and with the window open- hardly safe on the ground floor in central London. The room itself was the smallest I have ever stayed in- we mistook the bathroom for a closest it really was so small. We also got the impression that none of the staff fully understood us native speakers as there was definitely a poor standard of English among them, even management. All in all, the location of this hotel was good, but we will probably not return."
31,686,"Jan 26 2008	Good hotel overall but I won't go again	I stayed the hotel for 1 night in November 2007 with my mother. I booked a twin room through Last Minute. com. By reading the review of other people, I became sceptical to their booking system so I called up 1 week before the trip. The room booked with my name was a double room. So I asked to change it to a twin room. But when we arrived the hotel, we were told that there was no twin room available becasue one of thier rooms got problem in its bathroom so it all messed up the booking arrangement. And they asked us to stay in a double room but we refused. But they kept saying that there was no other option. So I asked them to cancel the booking and if they can help us to book another hotel or to book a room near Hearhrow airport where we're going to go next day. And here is what they said; 'I'm sorry but I believe all hotels around here are full and we don't have any branch near Heathrow. And the problem is you already paid for the room you booked'. So I raised my voice by anger saying it is not possible. Then they offered two single rooms. They had these rooms from the begining but they pretended they didn't have and tried to make us to stay in a double room! Anyway, we accepted.The rooms were so small. If you have a large suitcase, there is no space to open it. The bed was very small and uncomfortable, too (I am a thin Asian woman FYI). If you don't have much stuff and don't care about beds it may be OK. Hotel in general and the room, bathroom were quite clean and has nice atomosphere. The location is really good and it was quiet at night (I stayed on the 3rd floor). The breakfast was quite good as well. Other than the booking trouble, hotel stuffs are friendly and nice. Taking only the staying experience into account, I enjoyed the hotel and it was a nice hotel to stay. But from the booking problem, I woldn't use the hotel again. Also, it was too expensive (119/night) for such a small rooms."
32,686,"Jan 18 2008 	Very Clean 	Days Inn London Hyde Park is a great hotel if you want to get out and about in London. It is a 3 or 4 minute walk from Paddington station so anywhere on the tube network is easy to get to. My boyfriend and I stayed there in early December and the hotel let us check in a couple of hours earlier than planned and upgraded our room free of charge from a double to a family room.The room and main parts of the hotel were all very clean. The bedding and towels were all very clean and there was plenty of tea, coffee etc available in the room.The breakfast was good and it seemed that hot food was being cooked in smaller batches as apposed to loads being cooked and left under a heat lamp for hours! Overall a good hotel and most importantly, for a London hotel was reasonably priced."
33,686,"Dec 4 2007	Horrible	I am afraid I had bad experiences with the hotel. First of all, it is very expensive and it is not worth it. The rooms are tiny, without a table. Staff were rude and useless.Breakfast was horrible and cold."
34,686,Oct 2 2007 	very bad staff	We stayed here for 3 nights there was four girls we found the staff very unhelpfull with very very little English when we asked questions they just strut there shoulders &amp; when u did ask them someting they would speak in there own language smiling &amp; Laughing &amp; left you just standing there so forget about asking directions we where so p****d off that we wanted our money back to go to a different hotel and was told we dont have money here so we can not give it back to you.Then we where given rooms on the 4th floor and the 1st floor when we where there at 8.30am and asked for rooms on the same floor the rooms are so so small and very very basic the shower was a trickel of water coming out and dirty and as for the bar what you get is cans of beer?? it is a good location but that's it. what i would say is retrain your staff in customer service sort out the rooms and get a better bar
35,686,"Sep 19 2007 	Smallest double room ever!	Arrived at reception at 2130 hrs after a long flight - two staff on reception desk - one of whom spoke very poor English and had to enlist the help of the other to explain where breakfast was being served. No advice given whatsoever with regard to any other amenities (there did not appear to be any) but passed a sitting area behind reception which looked like a doctors waiting room but obviously served drinks, crisps etc.Our room was the smallest double room I have ever been in - felt completely riped off - this was a single room with a double bed squeezed in! In fact we did not think we would both get in along with our cases and could not lay them flat on the floor. Barely room to squeeze past the bottom of the bed to get to the toilet. En-suite was a joke - was not more that cupboard size and my husband (average build) was unable to dry himself outside the shower due to lack of space. Glass shelf over bathroom sink made washing/shaving almost impossible and whole room was in need of modernisation.Carpet in bedroom was grubby and had iron burn mark. Bed was clean but that was the only redeeming feature of the room.No information in room other than a letter from the manager explaining that modernisation had not been completed in some rooms (and ours was obviously one of them!)Room overlooked Sussex Gardens and there was constant noise throughout the night. Woken early by noise from neighbouring rooms - doors slamming and plumbing - must be a way of improving the soundproofing!Breakfast was buffet 'travel inn' style - served in the basement - which was accessed down a steep narrow marble stairway and was very claustrophobic due to lack of windows. Staff were completely indifferent and unhelpful.This was one of the worst hotels I have stayed in - nothing going for it apart from its convenient location. My advice is - pay a little extra for somewhere else - this was one false economy we will not be repeating."
36,686,Sep 12 2007 	Good Location	We stayed here for one night. The location was great for Hyde Park (Proms in the Park). I agree that the rooms are small but they are very clean and comfortable. Ours was at the back so no traffic noise. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was very good with lots of choice. There are a couple of friendly pubs around the corner. I would definitely stay here again and I think it was good value and the location was perfect for us
37,686,"Aug 27 2007 	Great little hotel	Only downside was room was very small -there was no room to put your case on the floor and open it. Other than that, the room was clean, tidy, comfortable and recently renovated. Bathroom compact but fully functional. Breakfast was excellent - buffet style with a huge range of food to suit all tastes. Few minutes walk from Paddington. Would definitely stay here again."
38,686,"Aug 12 2007 	Great!	We booked just a few days before we arrived and, thank goodness, didn't have to pay the full price. We felt that the full price was a bit much, but the reduced rate was appropriate. The hotel had recently been undergoing standardization, and it shows. The room had fresh paint, was very clean, and has a great location. The room wasn't huge, but European hotels never are. It was cleaned everyday, and it just felt clean. The only complaint I can think of is that while London has recently gone smoke free, I think the people next door to us still smoked in their room, and we could sometimes smell it in our room. The breakfast was great-eggs/ham/sausage/beans/cereal/yogurt/etc. It has some great places to eat close by, expecially the fish and chips place and the kabob place. We would stay here again!"
39,686,"Aug 6 2007 	mixed experience	First the good points - Great breakfast, great location, room was relatively clean , very small though, now the bad points: very noisy at night, at least our room was. The Staff were civil but not over friendly and seemed to be a bit confused about our internet booking,which is not what you want after paying so much for the room. Overall it's Okay, but next time i visit london, i will try somewhere else."
40,686,"Aug 3 2007 	Good loction 	excellent hotel in central London, i have rated the hotel 5 stars if there was more star I will add it.The hotel been recently refurbished, very good size rooms great location very helpful staff, healthy breakfast The guy in the reception &amp; bar (MOHAMED) is very helpful, polite and funny he gave us direction to every where in london. THANK YOU Very MUCH"
41,686,"Jun 21 2007	Compact	The location of this hotel nearly makes up for all other shortcomings. Its 5 minutes to a platform at Paddington station. There is a useful selection of local shops, pubs and restaurants nearby. Also a 5-minute walk is Lancaster Gate station on the Central Line, which is often quicker to get to than Paddington. The staff were generally very friendly and helpful. Had to wait a while for check-in as they were busy and were lacking any sense of urgency. They were kind enough to let us check-in early rather than just dumping our bags as Id planned for.The room (#107) was really too small. If you put a suitcase on the floor you then couldnt get round the end of the bed. On reflection I should have asked for another room, this was really a single room that theyd squeezed a double bed in to. The upside is it's cheap, modern, very clean and ideal if you just need a bed for the night. I wouldnt want to spend more than a couple of nights here or plan on spending too much time here between touring.The room was not air-conditioned which for 95% of the time in England is never going to be a problem. On a humid and relatively warm June night it was more annoying and added to the claustrophobic feeling of the room."
42,686,"Jun 14 2007	Clean close to Paddington Station good breakfast	We were there for three days in April. We had a room over the lobby, with a view onto Sussex Gardens. The window was huge. You could walk out of it onto a little balcony. I didn't notice air conditioning, but at that time of year we didn't need it. It could get a bit noisy with the traffic outside. We had no problems with check in, and it was nice to have an elevator, small as it was, to bring the suitcases up in. The breakfast room was in the basement, and the breakfast offerings were quite adequate. The rooms were recently refurbished and everything looked clean and well maintained. The front desk help was attentive. The room was small, but apparently that is quite common in the area. I gather that the hotel is comprised of more than one prior residence, so the rooms probably vary widely in size. It is a bit maze-like wending your way around."
43,686,"May 23 2007	Mixed Experience	Since my previous review I have been back to this hotel twice:The first time I arrived and had requested a room at the back of the hotel. It was fully booked and I had already been allocated a room at the front. The noise from traffic was really bad and I did not get any sleep. The hotel is on a busy road, which is noisy even during the early hours of the morning.After this experience, I had already booked my second stay. I requested a room at the back of the hotel before I left. The next time I arrived I had room 109. It was on the ground floor at the back and there was no street noise. It was not as small as a room I had once before on the first floor at the back. This may have been an upgrade....It depends what room you get, how your experience will be!"
44,686,"May 14 2007	Interesting experience	We stayed at this hotel for about 5 days in April and one day in mid may , for catching our flight back to US. The first time we stayed , we were given a room i think #121 . It was small and did not have any facilities other than a coffee maker. The shower was bad - if you stood under it for more than two minutes , the floor would become full since the water drained very slowly. So it is essential that you take your shower within 2 minutes or else jump out and wait for the water to drain before you enter. The second time we stayed we complained about our earlier room and were given a room on the second floor # 209. This was a bigger room , had a refrigerator , iron board. The good thing about the hotel is location. It is very close to Paddington station. Just exit the station and cross the road and walk straight down . I think the hotel is on the third left. The breakfast was good. The staff are not very friendly."
45,686,"Apr 21 2007 	Great location!	The best thing about this hotel is the location. Paddington Station is within walking distance. We drug our suitcases from the station to the hotel. We took the metro from Heathrow to the station, but took the Express back to Heathrow. They are both located at the same station. Just having this service is worth staying in the Paddington area.Our first room, #101, was terrible. It is immediately under the lobby, which isn't carpeted. We asked to be moved the next day. We got a better room, too. I told them that no one should be issued a room under the lobby. It should be a storage room!The breakfast was actually good. I booked four nights under my Trip Rewards program and paid for the fifth. We would never pay $200 a night for a hotel like this in the states! With the weak dollar, $200 doesn't buy much!There is a washerette around the corner. Very expensive to do one load. But nice to have if needed."
46,686,"Apr 20 2007 	Clean Tiny Room	Had an overnight wait between flights at Heathrow and decided to take Heathrow Express (15 minutes) into town for a quick look around late in the evening. Decided on this hotel because it is only about two blocks from Paddington station and most of the reviews here seemed good. The room was 98, and was INCREDIBLY small. There was almost no floor space to place our luggage or to walk around. There was a small armoire, and I managed to get one piece of luggage inside that, our carry on bags set atop the armoire. It is difficult to imagine spending several days in this room because of the cramped size, but since we were only sleeping overnight and then taking the Heathrow Express back to the airport in the morning, it wasn't a big problem for us. The room was very clean, well decorated, and well maintained. There was only a shower, no bath.After settling into our room, we went downstairs and asked the receptionist about calling us a taxi since I had heard of &quot;bandit&quot; taxis in London and wanted to make certain I didn't get one of those. She called a taxi for us and it arrived after about 10 minutes. The fare to Piccadilly Circus was 20, which seemed incredibly high to me. Later, when we decided to return to the hotel from Piccadilly Circus, we hailed one of the traditional &quot;Black Cabs&quot; and the return fare was only 10. So beware of asking reception to call a taxi for you. I think it's better just to go out on the street and flag down an available Black Cab.Upon return to the hotel, bought a couple of beers at reception to take up to the room, but then discovered the mini refrigerator in our room didn't work. I hurriedly drank the beers before they got warm and went to sleep. Good clean place to sleep for one night, but I wouldn't recommend it for a long stay."
47,686,"Apr 16 2007 	Great location perfectly adequate hotel	Days Hotel Hyde Park is in an excellent location, being within five minutes walk of Paddington Station, and fifteen/ twenty minutes walk from Oxford Street. I travelled from Heathrow to Paddington on the Heathrow Express-a service that I highly recommend. There is a stop for the Big Bus Tour just around the corner, from the hotel, on London Street, which is very convenient, and the Bus Tour is very good. The hotel itself is perfectly adequate for a short break in London. The rooms are equipped with all the usual- tea/ coffee making facilities, ironing board and hairdryer. Although the hotel is described as being newly renovated, it does need some attention in relation to ongoing maintenance. My initial impression of the staff was not good, I wondered if the staff I first met, at reception, were actually at all suited to the 'hospitality industry', as they were unwelcoming and unfriendly to the point of being rude. I was not given even the smallest bit of information one would expect -for example, the location of the breakfast room, or times when breakfast was served. Thankfully, the other staff members I encountered after this unpromising start were friendly and pleasant. The breakfasts are good, with a plentiful selection of hot and cold foods, including Cadburys Cream Eggs!The bar area is tiny, and if you are not a smoker, you will not stay there for very long!In summary, this hotel is perfectly adequate, and in a great location, with plenty of shops, restaurants and bars nearby."
48,686,"Mar 17 2007 	Not a great place...	The hotel's interior was fairly pleasant. However, our non-smoking room was tiny, even by European standards, and smelled like smoke. In addition, the housekeeper failed to clean our room on the first day that we stayed there. Also, the front desk neglected to give us an extremely important message that was left for us from the States. (We found this out when we returned home.)So, in summary, the hotel is decent to stay in, but the service leaves A LOT to be desired. For the price, which, although not exhorbitant, is substantial, I would have appreciated a bit better service.I think that we'll stay somewhere else on our next visit to London."
49,686,"Mar 3 2007	Very nice for the price the ask!	First impression when I entered the room was... - it's small. The second one was - it's VERY clear. Honestly, I really thought that a room could have been larger than what they offer, but I guess spaciousness is a problem for any of London hotels, unless it's a 5-stars hotel. However, when I've spent there 2 days (I've been staying there for 5), I have figured out that for the price they ask it is merely one of the best choices. Arguments are: the room (No 106) was very clear - I honestly have never seen a clearer room than this one: probably this is purely thanks to the fact the hotel is newly repaired - even the windows (what is seldom) were new and clear. Second, - the staff is very friendly and is always ready to assist. Third, the hotel itself, including how clean and new it is, how it is furnished, how the breakfast is served (and what is served), how it is situated (less than 1 minute to Paddington station, though on a quiet street), defenitely deserve a 3-stars rating. Forth, I've been there in February and the place itself (Sussex Gardens street) was very good - it was green and all over the streets there was lots of cherry trees covered with flowers. The room I've been living in, was not that large however (2-3 square meters more would be very nice), but it was absolutely enough for one whose main goal is exploring London, and who is spending only nights in his room. All in all, I am giving them 3 stars with no single doubt. Will defenitely stay here during my next trip to London. PS. There's LOTS of hotels on the same street - basically the whole street consists of hotels (this is defenitely more than you can find over Inet), but none of them outside looks that new as this one. PPS. On the foto you can see the room shot right from the door - it looks however larger than it is in reality due to this is a stitched panorama foto: the room is around 3.5x3.5 meters large and has a shower/lavatory of 1x2.5 meters."
50,686,"Jan 21 2007	the best we found in paddington	Only 4 minutes walk from paddington when we arrived it was more than we expected for the rate we were quoted which was 89 for a double and included a full English Buffet in the morning.The rooms had everything that we needed plasma screen, bath tub, wireless network, fridge, safe and most importantly our big comfortable bed. The staff catered to all our needs and were very friendly told us where all the hot spots in town was the good restaurants, the clubs and the sites. I do highly recommend this hotel and whenever i return to London i will be staying here for sure."
51,686,"Jan 4 2007 	Just the right place for a short London stay	Super- fitted the bill- great relaxed atmosphere- great location- helpful staff- great value, nice area, all in all great really."
52,686,"Nov 6 2006 	A pleasant stay.	We arrived on 1st Nov for 3 nights. First impressions were great, a nice clean reception and staff were very pleasant. We booked a family room for 3, the room was a bit small but it was clean and functional. flat screen TV, tea &amp; coffee facilities, WC with Shower &amp; hairdryer, we had a rear room so there was no street noise. Breakfast was self-service, english and continental breakfast and plenty of it and very enjoyable. The Hotel is ideally located 3-5mins walk from Paddington station, the L ondon BIg Bus stop was just around the corner (for those who enjoy the tour bus)The Days Hotel is an ideal place to stay for a shortbreak holiday, we would definitely stay there again but not for more than 3 nights."
53,686,"Oct 28 2006 	Better than expected...	Arrived in London without a room, bargained among a few of the Sussex Gardens hotels, and wound up here. Perfectly adequate for my purposes. Staff was friendly and room was clean and decently appointed for this level (dryer, pants iron, flat screen TV, wireless internet). Would definitely stay again."
54,686,"Oct 10 2006 	Small room but clean and functional	We had selected this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor and also based on price, which was reasonable for London and the location, which was great. The room we were in was small, but clean and comfortable, as was the en-suite. The road the hotel is located on was busy but our room didn't face the road so we weren't bothered by traffic noise. The only complaint we would have was the staff. When we arrived we were ignored for about 10 minutes while the receptionist answered several phone calls. He then directed all his conversation towards my husband, even though it was me who had made the booking and who's name was on the booking form, which I found very rude. Overall though our one night stay was comfortable in a well located hotel with a clean and modern environment."
55,686,"Sep 27 2006 	Very good clean hotel with friendly staff	We really enjoyed our stay here, the spotlessly clean and stylishly decorated reception area was a really good first impression of the hotel (the fresh flowers were an especially nice touch). The rooms were nice and modern with very comfortable beds and good facilities. We stayed on a b&amp;b basis and there was a very varied choice of good food on offer at breakfast time. The only bad thing (although I personally wasn't bothered by it) was the noise of the traffic as, if you are in one of the rooms at the front of the hotel like we were, you will be very near the main road. However, I'm sure this could be rectified on booking by asking for a room that's nearer the back of the hotel. I would definitely stay here and again wouldn't hesitate to recommended it."
56,686,"Jul 26 2006 	Exceeded our expectations	As first-timers to London, we had no basis for comparison but we were very pleased with the facilities and staff at Days Hotel London Hyde Park. We booked 3 nights on-line based on availability and comments like this (with only 2 weeks lead time). The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were beautiful in the renovated rooms. Impressive breakfast buffet. Yes, the traffic noise on Sussex Gardens was a problem because we had to keep the window wide open during some of the hottest summer days in London's history. Our 3rd night, when a 3rd person was joining us, we needed to change rooms and requested to be placed in the back. We were given a large family suite on 1st floor whose window opened to an interior dead-air space, so it was quiet but hot and stuffy. Maybe other back rooms are better? Any other time of year, we think our stay would have been flawless. Paddington Station and variety of restarants were close by."
57,686,"Jul 23 2006 	Rooms small but adequate	Very convenient hotel if you travel to London via Heathrow airport. Just 5 mins of walking from the Paddington Station (linked to Heathrow by 15-min express train).Rooms are really small (I stayed in a single room) but adequate if you need a room just to sleep. Renovation is fine, no leaking taps, everything is clean, flat screen TV with basic satellite channels like CNN. Some French, Greek and strangely Cyprus channels too. PayTV.Got a room with a full English breakfast for 80 British pounds, think it is a bargain for central London.Lancaster Gate Tube station on the Central Line is 5-7 min walk, very convenient if you want to travel to Oxford Street or within the downtown. Otherwise may walk to Paddington to take other Tube lines.Breakfast is excellent, selfserved, they even offered fresh strawberries with cream :-)Rooms facing the Success Gardens are of course noisy because of traffic, rooms facing internal yard are much better, however, absolutely no view. There are five rooms in the basement where the view is on the feet of pedestrians.Staff is friendly, first offered me a room facing the street, when I refused, changed it to an internal yard one. Also, 24-hour desk is a plus as many hotels on Success Gardens have no reception at night.There was a safe in the room operated by four batteries. One was missing. I tried to insert my own batteries but presumably the safe was permanently broken as it did not open. I did not ask reception to fix it, just didn't need it.WiFI internet is 10 British pounds per 24h, but works only on the ground floor, however, all rooms have network sockets, and the reception offers network cables free of charge.Again, bargain if only you are not claustrophobic."
58,686,"Jul 22 2006	Reasonable budget hotel	Days Hotel is situated about 2 minutes walk from Paddington station (mainline and underground services). About a 20 minute walk to central London (Oxford Street).The hotel had a nice feel to it for the budget traveller but we were allocated a small room just off the reception area - no A/C and very little air (to be fair, it was at the height of a heatwave).One other negative point: the hotel advertises free parking on Expedia but in fact the hotel charges 10 pounds per day.Very clean, seemingly newly-renovated, and reasonable value by London standards."

1,690,"Nov 20 2009 	STAFF NOT AS GOOD AS BEFORE	I have stayed in the Days Inn hyde Park before it was like a year and half ago and i was a very frequent visitor then. i use to go there every month but this year i had to go to some other country where there hotel was as bad as there staff. i could not wait to go to Days Inn Hyde Park again. The hotel is good but the staff was the best they use to make me and my friends so welcomed and they were so helpful. They make us want to go there every single time. But we got really dissapointed when we went this time as the staff was very cold and could barely remember my name more than five mins, i had to call them like 100 times before they come to check the tv and get me hot water. And some of them couldn't even understand English properly. I don't think that we will be going there anymore. Very sad"
2,690,"Nov 15 2009 	Excellent hotel	Stayed here for 4 nights and would go back again. The hotel is approx 5 mins walk from Paddington Railway station. The reception staff were very friendly and helpfull. They were very knowledge about the area. Our room was on the 1st floor and at the front of the building. Traffic noise was not really noticeable. Room was small but well furnished and adequate for us. Bathroom consisted of a large shower cubicle with power shower, toilet and washbasin. Towels were changed daily if required. We did find that the later in the morning you showered the less hot water there was but the shower was not cold. Breakfast consisted of cereal, fruit, yoghurt, toast, pastries, boiled eggs, fresh fruit, hot and cold beverages. The breakfast room staff were very pleasant and happy to help. The hotel is excellent and would recommend it. Will definately stay again."
3,690,"Nov 13 2009 	I'd very happily stay again and recommend this hotel to others.	I really enjoyed my four-night stay at the Days Inn London Hyde Park. From the street, it would be difficult to distinguish the property from countless other, rather uninspiring-looking cheap hotels clustered around Paddington railway station. But really, from the moment, I entered the hotel last Sunday evening, it was clear that the Days Inn is in a different league and I was impressed throughout my stay by the friendliness and professionalism of the staff; the cleanliness and facilities in the room and the standard of the breakfast - the price of which was included in the room rate. Yes, the bedroom was small - but actually I rather liked that; and it had every facility you could want including a smart en suite shower, a television and tea and coffee-making facilities. There was nowhere to hide away my suitcase but again, I didn't find that a problem. For what is a budget hotel, I thought the breakfast was very good. There was a buffet offering cereals, toast, cakes, fruit, yoghurt; a choice of drinks and juices. I was also impressed by the staff overseeing the dining room, making sure that dirty dishes were quickly cleared away and that supplies of food and drink were continually replenished. The hotel is in a great location for visitors to London - just two minutes walk from Paddington (with its express link to Heathrow) and for the Tube. There's also a multitude of good value pubs, shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. And there's a real neighbourhood feel about the area. If I have one criticism (and it's really more of an observation); I think the hotel might think again about charging 3 an hour to access the Internet (situated in the bar area.) . I imagine most guests don't want to be on the Internet for so long, so it would be better if the hotel charged say 50p for ten minutes. If not, guests will probably do what I did which is to nip round the corner where there are at least two Internet cafes offering a cheaper price. It's not a big deal but for a hotel which seemed to get everything else absolutely right, it came across as a bit of unnecessary, petty penny-pinching. Overall though, I look forward to returning soon and would happily recommend this hotel to others which, in the end, is the ultimate compliment you can pay any hotel."

1,695,"Aug 27 2009	Acceptable	Stayed at hotel for 4 nights, two with a tour group and two on our own. Hotel seemed to be in a good location for tube service. Close to shopping and a reasonable amount of eating establishments nearby. Room #30 was adequate for the two of us and we had plenty of room. Room faced street and bathroom was large. Box of candy supplied to room was a nice personal touch."
2,695,"Jun 14 2009 	Lovely quintessentially European hotel	I found the Diplomat after my other accommodations fell through the night before my departure, and the folks at the Diplomat were most helpful in helping me to avoid the chaos that might have ensued. The staff was friendly, welcoming, and well-informed. The hotel was well-appointed, charming, and convenient to my work and leisure activities, as well as convenient to public transportation and points of interest. The complimentary breakfast was varied, delicious, and plentiful. Though my room was small, it had a small balcony and it was certainly more than adequate for my needs. The lovely fruit and chocolate basket on my first night added to the charm, as well. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there. The Diplomat is one of the best places I've stayed in Europe."
3,695,"May 26 2009 	Disaster	Booked a single on line and arrived at 1pm. Was offered the basement which I declined. So I was shown to a tiny room, probably 10 feet * 7 feet, including the wash stand! Not even any room for a night stand. The weather was warm, late April, and they could not shut off the radiator. After much complaing, I was given a large double room on the top floor which was fine but VERY noisy with taxis passing all night long. What a shamer that a charming house in a great neighborhood (Sheraton Belgravia is only about 30 yards away) can be so poorly and greedily operated.TO BE AVOIDED"
4,695,"May 10 2009 	Hotel OK	Hotel is ok. Located in Belgravia. Not near anything specific. no stores, transportation, etc. really very very close. Although certainly available within walking distance.Rooms are good size. mostly single or 2 single beds. We did have a double. hotel attempts to have an old elegant feel to it. great winding staircase in the lobby but the room while not musty did have a faint odor. sort of not fresh or old. bed was ok. bathroom was long and skinny - appeared they took one side of room and build in bathroom. first come in to towel rack. then pass long tub - barely room to walk by with curtain and hand held shower - which I hate - then come to sink and toilet. no towel rack or place for cosmetics etc at this end. not sure why there is not towel rack etc down here. certainly room to put one on the wall.we were only there one night and had to leave before full breakfast was available. breakfast room was nice. we had a quick continental type breakfast. there is a very small elevator.not the cheapest in the area. no computer available for guests to use."
5,695,"Apr 17 2009 	Avoid the Basement	I don't have any idea on how the hotel is except for its basement. Our room was located underground and was extremely noisy after 7am. Every day (we spent 4 nights) at 7am hotel employees started to open and close the basement door of the hotel. Every two minutes there were walls trembling because of their absolute uncapacity to realize that customers were sleeping in that dark basement. Additionally, cars traffic was producing noise and pollution just above our heads.The rest? Breakfast is good and rich. The hotel location is great. Probably, if you have the chance to be located in a room where you can view the sky, the accomodation is good."
6,695,"Apr 12 2009 	over priced and basic	my girlfriend and i have stayed in various hotels in london and although in a great location we were disappointed with the diplomat hotel.staff were friendly and helpful however our room was small, basic and very old fashioned. the 'colour tv' was fuzzy and took up too much space in the already small room. the bath had multiple hairs in it from previous occupants and the toiletries supplied were half full. the bath only had a hand held shower which was inconvenient for an over night stay and early check out time (11.30am!)we found the fact that you have to hand your key in and ask for it back every time you leave and return to the hotel unnessecary.the full english breakfast complete with sweetcorn(!?) was lukewarm, sparse and poor.compared with other london hotels that we have stayed in we found the diplomat over priced. the other hotels have been in equally as good locations with bigger, better furnished rooms and more superior eating facilities than the diplomat."
7,695,"Sep 29 2008 	Keep Going Back!	My mother was the person in our family that found this hotel. We have all become frequent guests since her initial trip. This hotel is a great place to stay if you're looking for a quaint, quiet place to rest while you're visiting London. It's in a beautiful building, and the rooms, although some are quite small, are all nicely furnished and comfortable. I did have one room with such a small bathroom, my sink was in my bedroom! It ended up being my favorite room.The breakfasts are quite good as well. They're not 5 star gourmet, but they are filling and tasty. What really makes this place special is the staff. They are universally friendly and extremely helpful. Once my mother left her coat in her room after she checked out. When she came the next time, they had had the coat laundered and it was hanging in her closet when she arrived. I plan on staying here on all future London trips. When my elderly grandmother, great aunt and mother were all in London, they chose to stay at the Diplomat and had an absolutely fabulous time!"
8,695,"Aug 26 2008 	This Is a Great Hotel	While living on the outskirts of London earlier this year, I needed a place to stay for one night near a friend's house. I walked down to the Diplomat Hotel, and was amazed at the price. Very reasonable, especially considering what a nice area this is and the historic and beautiful building the hotel occupies. Breakfast was really good, unlike my experience in most of the B&amp;Bs in the Victoria/Belgravia area. I love this place, and highly recommend it. I have stayed in many hotels in London, and for the price and considering the location, this is a bargain."
9,695,Oct 24 2007	great hotel	this is a great location. i have stayed here two times for business. it is in walking distance from many great places. the area is quiet but yet so close to all the excitement and great shopping. i would definitely recommend this hotel. the price is great considering the location!
10,695,"Jan 3 2007 	Great value perfect location	This hotel has a great location (in Belgravia, very close to Knightsbridge). It is very close to most sights, walking distance to some of them. If you have an idea about the general price level in London, this hotel is incredibly cheap given its location and comfort. It is also very clean and the staff is very polite. I would highly recommend this hotel."
1,702,Aug 20 2009 	'Dirty' House contained shabby furniture falling to pieces...	We had to move from the first apartment we were allocated because of a blocked toilet stuffed with loo paper; a really unpleasant 'welcome' showing housekeeping were not stringent. The place didn't feel clean at all - dusty and musty - and the furniture was shabby - we found one table was broken and another breakfast table / footstool collapsed under us. The apartment kitchens in particular were of a very poor and basic standard and very sparsely equipped - we had to ask for teabags and milk as we'd arrived late when all the shops were shut - there was no consistency of supplies. The breakfast was poor quality too - supermarket croissants and the juice not freshly squeezed but from a carton - not what you expect when paying this sort of money. We were simply not at all happy there and moved after a couple of days
2,702,Aug 16 2009 	Beware!! The website paints a different picture.	Shabby
3,702,Aug 7 2009 	Perfect London hotel for our family!	We researched many hotels to accomodate our family of 4 - two middle school kids. Wanted enough beds &amp; space to spread out. This was perfect. We had 2 &quot;living rooms&quot; &amp; a small kitchen
4,702,Jul 24 2009 	Your very own Sloane street Pied-a-terre....	Durley house could quintessentially become my own Sloane street Pied-a terre! Impressive with its 11 beautiful rooms it remained a soothing calmness and air of a private house. I was delighted to be greated by such a warm welcome after battling against the awful english weather! And was even more delighted to enter a beautifully spacious apartment complete with a kitchen! If like me you need privacy and space but still need to remain in the heart of London city then Durley House is a perfect pied-a-terre to call your very own.....well at least for a little while...!	
5,702,Apr 24 2009 	Enjoy the space and location..great for families.	I had read very mixed reviews about this hotel
6,702,Nov 19 2008 	Don't go there whatever you do!	The web sight made it look like a luxury hotel and nothing could be further from the truth: peeling wallpaper
7,702,"Mar 13 2008 	Fantastic service but a tired ""gem"" in the West End	We were looking for a London hotel and booked Durley House via Lastminute.com as it had a nice description and was an excellent price for its prime location. Check in was excellent with fantasticaly helpful and friendly staff who sped us through the process and whisked us up to our room. We had booked a one bedroom suite / appartment (they are all suites / appartments but some have 2 bedrooms). The room itself was very clean and comfortable although a little &quot;tired&quot; in its decoration. Very large and comfortable bed! My only complaint would be the poor water pressure for the shower.We ate in our room and must compliment the hotel on its food. It was excellent. The wine is very resonably priced. Food orders are sent to the room via a dumb waiter and then served by a member of the hotel staff.I would throughly recommend Durley House. The service is outstanding and the location is excellent. If they redecorated this would be a truley outstanding place to stay in London.	"
8,702,Nov 5 2007 	LocationLocation and Family Friendly	My family (two adults + two girls aged 6 &amp; 3) stayed in this hotel in October 2007. We stayed in a &quot;two bedroom luxury apartment&quot; for four nights in October. It was a special trip as we were celebrating a milestone birthday for my wife
9,702,Sep 27 2007 	World Traveller	A rather shabby property demanding high rates for what really should be priced for less. The food was terrible
10,702,Aug 31 2007 	Warning: Routine Maintenance Not Being Done and Not Very Clean	This hotel is definitely on the decline and needs some MAJOR renovations if it wishes to bill itself as a &quot;luxury&quot; property. It appears as if no money has been spent on routine mantenance recently. We stayed in two different rooms and both had problems......broken window cords
11,702,Mar 17 2007	A little paradise in the heart of London	In the last few years 
12,702,Feb 12 2007 	Great Location but Tired	Have stayed a couple of times due to the great location on Sloan St. Rooms are good size but need updating. The staff is friendly but not well trained. They are not knowledgeable about London restuarants
13,702,Oct 6 2006 	Not enough for what I paid	One thing is old and a different thing is dirty. This is a very historical place but things like the bathrooms seem like haven't been cleaned since 1800!! Although the hotel staff is nice and helpful
14,702,May 12 2006 	There are better places to go	Very nice home atmosphere
15,702,Feb 6 2006 	a second home in central london	I was welcomed by the hotel manager
16,702,Aug 21 2005	The best service ever!!!	This is such a well kept secret that I feel reluctant to tell anyone else about it! Durley House is a five star &quot;All suite&quot; Hotel but in fact is more like having your own apartment in Sloane Street. My Suite was beautiful and had a very English feel (wonderful two bedrooms for the family); only slight complaint was that it needed new carpet as a few stains were quite large and visible.The real charm of this Hotel is the staff. Amazing! Never before has my family been made to feel more welcome and at home. Garrett spent more then 20 minutes on our arrival making sure that we had all the right restaurant choices and that we were as comfortable as possible. He was spot on all 6 times!! The whole place is amazing and is by far my best Hotel stay in all of my 40 years of Travel. Highly recommended!	
1,708,Oct 23 2009 	BED BUGS AT THIS HOTEL	Will never stay in an EasyHotel again - I have at least 10 bed bug bites - reception staff entirely uninterested.l
2,708,"Sep 6 2009 	Small room	If you are planning to stay long in london, then this is not the room you are looking for, its really very small for asian size. But the location make up for it. its walking distance to burmingham palace, near victoria station."
3,708,"Aug 9 2009 	Clean well located and cheap but basic	When booking at easyHotel you should know what you expect. We were looking for an affordable accommodation in Central London and we stayed there for 3 nights. The hotel is well located in a good area and close to Victoria station (convenient for connections). The room was basic but clean with a private bathroom. Of course do not expect too much comfort, the rooms are a bit small and some of them have no window but if you are away the whole day and just need a clean place to stay for few nights that's good enough."
4,708,"Aug 4 2009 	A good deal- not for a long stay though!	This is exactly what it says on the tin, cheap and no frills- and extras will cost you (e.g television). The hotel is within easy walking distance of Victoria station/tube from which you can pretty much get to anywhere in London. We paid 42 for a small room with a window. The room was tiny, literally the bed was touching all four walls, with a small space to hop into bed. The ensuite was much the same, you could sit on the loo and shower at the same time...if you wanted to of course!The positives of this hotel was of course the price but also the room was incredibly clean, crisp sheets, fresh towels. They even provided soap and shampoo-which i was not expecting!The downside was, even if you book a room with a window (something i paid 5 extra for the luxury) it does not guarantee it will be worth it. Our room was in the basement, so having a window was pretty much pointless as the brick wall directly infront of it blocked out and light we had hoped for. Another real annoyance was the constant air conditioning, which we could not turn off. Be warned, we couldnt open our window, and so we ended up extremely dehydrated from the constant blasting of cold air. Had we stayed for longer I would've spoken to the hotel staff, however we were only there for a short stop over. All in all I would consider staying again, however I would try to iron out the problems before booking again. For the price, and a short stay I couldn't really ask for much more, however I would not even think about staying here for longer than 2 nights!"
5,708,"Aug 3 2009 	Very good quality budget hotel if you're not interested in frills	I have stayed in some really *really* bad budget hotels in the Victoria railway station area during a three-week trip, but I found this one to be a good mix between price and quality. If you don't mind having a small room without windows, then you can get a good room for a phenomenally low price by London standards. You do have to pay for Internet, TV, and subsequent housekeeping visits (beyond the one from the first check-in), but these are no trouble. I'll be staying here again on future trips to London."
6,708,"Aug 2 2009 	indescribably bad	I used to like Easyjet - you know you'll get no fuss or frills but neither will you be belittled and despised as you are when you travel with Ryan Air..........at least that's what I thought. So I booked my Easyhotel online expecting cheap, small, clean, no-nonsense accommodation. What I found was a cupboard and a portaloo in a run down building that resembled something out Taxi Driver. The walls were bright orange. The room was so small it could accommodate nothing other than a bed......nothing, not even a stool and the floor was industrial grade black plastic lino.I have worked most of my life in the hotel business so I tend to be on the side of the operator but this is a piece of brand extension that actually does a lot more harm than Stelios understands. Not only will I never go near one of his hotels again but I have just booked my family on Flybe when I could have used Easyjet."
7,708,"Aug 1 2009 	cheap and clean	Stayed for 3 nights with my partner and found the hotel to be extremely clean with very friendly staff.We weren't sure about booking an easyhotel but will happily do so in future. The prices are attractive for Central London, and that usually costs a ridiculous sum of money. It's in a great location, very close to Victoria station. The rooms are small (and the bathrooms tiny!) but for 50 pounds a night we thought it was great value."
8,708,Jul 19 2009 	Just 3 IFs	If you have your clean sheets pillow cases m with you (We asked for new clean sheets but it was not clean at all)If you are planning to stay not MORE than 3 nightsIf you are ready to spend the whole day out and just come back to sleep (I mean you can come back to the hotel just to set down and relax)Then this is a value for money hotel
9,708,"Jul 17 2009 	Absolutely avoid this one low cost no value	Climb narrow stairs to an orange painted room the size of a jail cell. Two hooks on the wall to hang clothes. A bathroom the size of what you find on a plane. Extra charge for a room with a window, a tv remote, having the room cleaned, an extra towel, leaving luggage in the lobby while waiting to check in at 1500. You cannot get a refund when you tell the desk that the room in unacceptable and cancel the remaining nights, you get a credit you use or lose in the next twelve months. The additional charges make this room as expensive as rooms far, far better in the neighboorhood"
10,708,"Jul 10 2009 	It is what it is cheap 	I was only spending one night in London with some friends and I didn't want to spend as much money as them. Just somewhere to crash after a big night out. This was perfect as I was going on holiday the very next day and just wanted to be able to have a shower and then just get up and out. No hanging around no messing - perfect!Chose the location well too as on my last view visits to London I have had problems on the underground at weekends.Also I dont like having to change trains on the underground either. Easyhotel is literally a two minute walk from Victoria Station &amp; the Victoria line was working so everywhere I wanted to go was within easy reach, My friends were staying in Mayfair so one stop down to meet them, we had a night out in Covent Garden, also on the same line and then a few stops up to Kings Cross to get the train to the airport the next day. I studied this and I have definately come to the conclusion that this is the best located out of all the Easyhotels in London for me.The room itself, check-in was quick &amp; easy as was checking out. Room itself was tiny as was the bathroom and I could hear everything from the other rooms. One negative point for me was that I was on my own on a saturday night and there were large groups of young people hanging around outside until very late which could make some people feel uneasy. I just wanted to get back to my room &amp; sleep!Massive plus points for me, Very comfy bed and bedding &amp; the shower, if a little small was great.Minus points I wouldn't have wanted to spend a great deal of time in the room and when I got up I didn't want to hang around I was very glad that I got ready to go out for the evening at my friend's posh Mayfair hotel though as I found the Easyhotel a bit cramped just for me. If I was with my husband it would have been very cumbersome us both getting ready!Taxi fares weren't bad here either. We had such a good night in Covent Garden we ended up missing the last tube and getting a taxi back in the wee small hours from Leicester Square. To give you an idea of fares it cost 15 to drop my friends off in Mayfair and then me off at the Easyhotel.To summarise, If you are on your own and just need somewhere to crash this place is perfect considering I only paid 50 in central London! I'd splash the cash if I was with my husband."
11,708,"Jul 6 2009 	Cosy	Cosy is definately one word for the rooms! What the website says is what you get - a basic room, with bed, toilet and shower.The room was clean, the bed was comfy. To be honest, we didnt spend much time in the room - who does in London when theres so much to do, plus we went to see Tina Turner in the O2, so we literally only used the room to sleep.If you are going to book this hotel, what I would advise is to pay the extra 1-00 or whatever it is for a room with a window. The window made a huge difference to us - just to get some natural light in the room. I cant imagine how claustrophobic the rooms without windows must be.All in all, a clean friendly basic no frills hotel. it served a purpouse, and will definately use them again if we go to London for the night, and just need somewhere to get our heads down. Were else can you get a room 2 mins walk from Victoria station at such a low price??!!!"
12,708,"Jul 3 2009 	Would definitely stay again	Stayed for 3 nights with my partner and found the hotel to be extremely clean with very friendly staff. No breakfast but what can you expect for less than 30 each per night!! The only downside about the room was it's size....it was tiny!!! No room for luggage, just a bed on one side which filled nearly all the space, the rest of the space we used to stand the suitcase up in and a bathroom with shower. It didn't really matter because we had said as long as the room was clean; and it was; then it would be fine. We were on the back so it was very quiet until the noisy neighbours checked in! The walls are thin and we could hear them talking/laughing quite a bit. Even so we would certainly consider staying again."
13,708,"Jun 24 2009 	Clever concept	Two and a half square meters of bed, one and a half square meter of bathroom and possibly one square meter to stand up and get dressed. Its simple and its brilliant for the solo explorer who needs just that. Just leave your claustrophobia at home and you will be fine. I have only one wish; please offer free wifi!"
14,708,"Jun 15 2009 	Does what it says on the tin	We weren't sure about booking an easyhotel but will happily do so in future. The prices are attractive since most of the time we're just looking for somewhere to sleep in London, and that usually costs a ridiculous sum of money. With the bedroom menu that they offer, you know what you're getting. And contrary to my worst fears, the hotel wasn't in some horrible slum; it was in a great location and was clean and tidy throughout. The staff were efficient and helpful (but not five-star luxury smiley, which was fine by us). We had a standard room with no window - absolutely fine, imagine small rooms are not much more than a bed surrounded by four walls. Bed was fine (pillows could have been better), bathroom was one of those pods much like you get in an Ibis, pretty tight but functioned and was really clean, and to my surprise had shampoo and shower gel dispensers. There was no furniture other than the bed, so if you're staying more than one or two nights be prepared to live out of your suitcase. The floor was lino like you get in schools and hospitals - not cosy, but at least clean, and preferable to manky carpet. I could have forgiven them if they hadn't branded the room by painting one wall bright orange, but that's to be expected I suppose. Overall, a decent place to lay your head and grab a shower in the morning, saving some pennies for the train journey and a nice breakfast en route. Wouldn't hesitate to use again, and have booked their Kensington hotel for a few weeks' time."
15,708,"Jun 14 2009 	You get what you pay for	Stayed here for 2 nights last month and it is perfect for a few cheap nights in London. It's in a great location, very close to Victoria station. The rooms are small (and the bathrooms tiny!) but for 50 pounds a night we thought it was great value. We were glad we splashed out the extra 5 pounds a night for a window as I think it would have been a bit claustrophobic otherwise and if you have a lot of luggage you might want to get one of the slightly larger rooms. The beds are also small and it's a wee bit noisy so fine for a few nights but perhaps not much longer. However, it was spotlessly clean and the front desk staff were really helpful and friendly. There are lots of restaurants and pubs close by. We went to a Thai place on corner of Tachbrook and Charlwood Streets that was excellent."
16,708,Jun 12 2009 	Great inexpensive place to lay your head near Vic Station *Book Early for discounts*	This is a great place to stay if you are just looking to crash for a night. It is cheaper than a hostel and is private and very close to the train and bus station.
17,708,"May 22 2009 	Exactly what it purports to be.	It's small (and I mean TINY), there are no stairs, no window, no elevator, and absolutely no extras. This is exactly what they said it would be on the website. A very clean room to have a good sleep in and to get a hot shower...a very short walk from Victoria. If you're looking for luxury, boy are you looking in the wrong place! But a clean room THAT close to Victoria, $166 US for three nights, in LONDON?! Excellent value. I was barely in the room anyway, so this is just what I needed. Not recommended for those who are claustrophobic; seriously."
18,708,"May 21 2009	Clean basic hotel. Great value for money.	Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor and the hotel's website, I decided to risk easyHotel. I was very glad I did. My mum and I were in London for two days to see some shows and were in the hotel for a total of 8 hours, 6 of which we spent sleeping. So it really wasn't worth spending 100+ on a more expensive hotel.On arrival, the receptionist was very friendly and we were given a (standard, with window) room on the ground floor, close to reception (which was handy when we couldn't work out how to make the lights in the room stay on...the nice man on reception told us that the key card needs to be left in the slot next to the door whenever you're in the room or the lights will go off!). The bed was lovely and comfy and the bathroom clean. What more do you really need when you're in the room for such a small amount of time? The only problem for me was that there was nothing to put smaller items (watch, jewellery etc.) on overnight. It was just a bed in a room, no little tables or anything. The hooks on the wall were useful for hanging clothes on though. It would have been nice to have the option of a twin room rather than doubles only, but that is only a small point and we didn't mind sharing for one night.My mum hadn't read the website or reviews so possibly wasn't as prepared as me for just how basic it would be. I had to keep reminding her of how little we paid. I would recommend that everybody who stays in this hotel reads plenty of reviews so as not to get too much of a shock.We agreed after checking out that we would not want to stay for more than 2 or 3 nights but that we would definately return, and have since booked again for the end of May.The pricing seems very fair to me. You pay a small price for a very basic room, but have the option to spend more money on extra towels, pillows, a hired hairdryer, television, to make yourself more comfortable.Give it a try, but go prepared, and remember to bring a sense of humour!"
19,708,"May 2 2009 	basic cheap and very good!	We booked a basic room without window at the price of around 46 ponds a night per room. We got an attic room, very tiny but clean, good shower, good bed, in fact everything you need in a city like londen! excellent value for money!!!!"
20,708,"Apr 29 2009 	Cheap and cheerful!	Like the rest of the easy group, the easyhotels seem to do exactly what they say on the tin! As others have said, the rooms are tiny - more like a ship's cabin, and the bathroom is more like an aeroplane loo, but they're clean and comfortable and good value for money. The London Victoria one is in an excellent location - you'd struggle to find anywhere else nearby for the same price! I don't think I'd want to stay in one for a week because the rooms are so small, but for an overnight stay, they're ideal. Worth paying a couple of pounds extra for a room with a window though - I think the ones without windows would get very claustrophobic!"
21,708,"Apr 21 2009 	God awful!	A friend and i were going to a festival in london, so we needed somewhere cheap to stay, easy hotel seemed to be the right sort of price, and i read reviews and all seemed average, then it was booked.Got to the hotel, as we were checking in there was 2 people that complained about the toilets, and the hotel staff seemed to shift them off until they had dealt with us. Got to the room, oh dear.Literally walk in, confronted with a MASSIVE orange 'easyhotel.com' wall and a double bed.I wanted to walk out straight away, i know it was going to be basic but the room was SOOOO tiny! The toilet is a small door in the wall, and the shower is also in this space, its like a 2 in 1 little cupboard. It was shocking! I've stayed in better hostels than that place!Anyway, expect to pay for extra pillows etc...oh and a remote! They give you a TV in the room but you have to pay for the remote! Haha.The only good thing about this hotel was the location..5 mins walk from victoria station.If you are wary over this hotel, trust me over other reviews, it's really bad!"
22,708,Apr 3 2009 	value for money	Excellent hotel in a convenient location . Provide great value for money as you dont pay for extra services that are not needed. Found it very clean . Staff were nice
23,708,"Feb 27 2009 	very good value!	i stayed in this easyhotel for 5 nights.room 117.it was just good!you have to pay anything extra such as a remote control for the tv which is 5pounds for 24h(i took the remote with me back to greece though!!!!!!)clean sheets and fresh towels is 1pound each...extra room clean is 10pounds per day....and the wifi connection to your room is 5pounds per hour but you dont have to do that because both pret a manger and starbucks have free wifi zones inside and its absolutely free for 1h and is within 10 minutes walking distance from where you are....very close to victoria station(connection to gatwick airport, london underground and victoria coach station)small rooms good prices though!you can t find these prices in london and in such a central landmark!recomended without doubts but be prepaired for tha stairway because there is no elevator!!!i will definitely stay to this hotel again!"
24,708,"Feb 20 2009 	couldnt swing a hamster in the rooms never mind a cat	just come back from a 3 night stay at the easyhotel,now obviously you get what you pay for like anything,we were not expecting anything brilliant but they are so small ,and little things seemed so expensive, eg 15 for a late check out is very expensive when you compare it to a premier inn etc,also the tv and internet prices were not very competative.however the rooms and hotel in genaral was very clean and the staff were all friendly,i just think the website needs updating shall we say with more clear pictures (and bigger). also it says the avarage size of the room was 6-7 square metres,but without measureing i would say the room we stayed in was nowhere near that; more like 6-7sq. ft (l.27) on basement floor). privacy isnt an option, you can hear everything in the rooms, including next door flushing the toilet and having a shower. for a one night stay this would be adequate but for anymore it realy is to basic as we were tripping over our suitcase (was lucky we managed to cram all our clothes etc in the one case as there would be no room for 2) and also the bathroom was a little to small, and became completely soaked anytime we had a shower.without going on, i was disappointed with the lack of sound proofing, as each night of my stay i was woken by people in the surrounding rooms and the corridor. something also should be done about the lack of air conditioning in the room, the vents, which neither the staff nor customer had any control over, were simply not effective."
25,708,"Feb 8 2009 	was just ok	well ive stayed in an easyhotel b4 (earls court) so knew exactly wot to expect, the room was super small but cheap and functional, for those who have not stayed in one b4 a small room with no window is about the size of 2 double beds together, but has one double bed and a shower toilet pod in there , it was clean altho must be one of the first ones as its getting a bit tatty, (shower pod sealant pealing and that sort of thing) the earls court one is much more fresh, i would say is an apprpriate word, and i feel the staff were bettter at earls court, not that there was anything wrong with them at the victoria, i just felt had anything gone wrong at the victoria they would not have been inclined to of helped, the only other thing i didnt like about it was the lower standards of security, at earls court the main door was locked at all times and need your pass to enter, ect, however after i got back from my night out, about 1 ish, doors here were still open, and a word of warning the walls are not real walls just private partitions you can here everything that goes on, but then ya get proper hotels like that so dont think it should affect ya booking ,the location is good, was only 7 in a taxi from shaftsbury avenue in the west end to hotel at 1am thought that was cheap,the bus train and tube station is just a small walk from the hotel (just at end of road)enjoy your stay in london this is a very cheap way of seeing wot london has to offer, if ya book early a room for 25 more than makes up for all that it lacks"
26,708,"Feb 6 2009 	You get what you are promissed!	I stayed in EasyHotel Victoria for 3 nights, and I believe that the whole experience is quite honest. Mainly if you read carefuly their website, you know what to wait for. Rooms' describtions are absolutely accurate and they don't lie when they say eg you get 2 hooks to hang your clothes in the room or your room is 6 square metres or whatever they say. It's exactly like that. Room was clean and bed was very comfortable. Dut to rooms' size, I wouldn't advise people with lots of lagages to stay there, and I think that rooms will be better used by a sinlge person than by a couple.Obviously there is not luxury stay. It's a cheap room, that will save you some money and at least will definately be clean.My room was G10 (standard with a window), had a large window facing buildings behind the hotel, and the radiator could be turned on and off from me, so it was practical! If you don't have a computer and want to use the one in reception area, note that they charge GBP 2 for 15 minutes (!) and they don't allow access in sites such as youtube and facebook!!!!"
27,708,"Jan 8 2009 	Bit of a mixed bag	I stayed at the easyHotel Victoria for 4 nights early January for work. All in all, the hotel experience was perfectly pleasant. I'll join the chorus that the rooms really *are* tiny - which is fine if you are using it as a place to sleep and wash, but not much fun if you fancy spending an evening relaxing in your room.I booked one of the small windowless rooms for 25 a night, which was situated on the lower ground floor in the basement. The check-in staff were friendly and efficient, although the corridor in the basement was a bit musty and smelled of spicy cooking. The room had enough space for a double bed, which you accessed cabin-like through a gap of about 2.5 feet from the main 'room'. There were two plug sockets, two hooks on the wall, and a full length mirror. There was hardly any floor space in the room proper - to open my suitcase I had to stand in the bathroom, and to leave the room I had to store my case on the bed. The bed itself was comfy, and the whole room was clean if a bit grim in an underground bunker/cross channel ferry type of way. Two thin pillows, duvet, sheets and two towels are included, although you pay extra for housekeeping. There was a flat screen TV on the wall with adequate reception, but you pay extra for a handset to watch it (5 for 24 hours). The bathroom, although tiny, was very efficiently laid out with a toilet, sink and a decent shower, with soap and body wash included and space to store toiletries. Hot water was sporadic, and ensure you close the bathroom door if you don't want to flood your room!My main complaint was the central air. When I arrived it was very cold outside, but in my room it must have been 30c from the hot air blasting out of two vents in the ceiling! After asking for the heating to be turned down twice, I was provided with a desk fan - which wasn't ideal in a room with no surfaces except the bed. 4 hours later, when the heat was making me feel incredibly claustrophobic, I complained and it was turned right down and remained comfortable throughout my stay. The room itself was quiet enough at night, with not much bleed from other rooms and only the rumble of the underground trains below.The main plus point of this hotel - beside the price, which is comparable to a hostel bed - is the location. Close to Victoria Station and tube, and about a minute from a bus stop, it's also in easy walking distance of many restaurants, pubs, shops and a Sainsbury's supermarket. All in all, it's an efficient place to lay your head and store your belongings while you spend much of your time out doing other things, and doesn't pretend to be otherwise."
28,708,"Dec 13 2008	Tiny room but good for the experience	I stayed for two nights at easyHotel London Victoria, mainly for the experience of it, after hearing how small the rooms were. So, I intentionally booked a 'small room' (with window, 45 per night).It did not disappoint - in fact the room was even smaller than I expected. The room was literally the size of a double bed, with a bit of space for opening the door and to access the bed. If I had a lot of luggage, I wouldn't have been able to get into the room unless I put my luggage on the bed. I thought it was quite hilarious and took photos for my friends. Some of the walls were orange and so was quite a bit of the bathroom. So if you have a pathological fear of orange colour, this hotel is definitely not for you. The room, including the bathroom) was very clean.Watch out if you are not physically strong and have a heavy bag. There is no lift and stairs are quite steep.Location is pretty good, with Victoria station nearby and with basic shopping facilities (e.g. Sainsbury's) and cafes within a short walking distance.I don't think I could have coped more than two nights there though because of the orange colour and the claustrophobic feeling (even though I booked a room with a window).If you want a cheap accommodation in central London location and don't mind a small, very orange room, it would be a good place to stay. It's also quite fun for the experience of a tiny room and I'd quite happily recommend my friends to try it out for a bit of a laugh as long as they know what they're letting themselves into. I would use again it if just I need a bed for a few hours during transit or planning a late night followed by early departure, at, but personally, I wouldn't use it for a normal hotel stay. Once is an experience and I didn't mind it at all, but I think I prefer to stay at a 'normal sized' hotel with a lift."
29,708,"Dec 13 2008 	Budget hotel on a great location	If you're looking for luxury and a spacious room, the Easyhotel Victoria is not for you. But if you're aiming for a clean hotel room with bathroom (really tiny, but with shower and lots of hot water) and a confortable bed on a budget, look no further. I stayed with my boyfriend on room 101 with a window. It faced the back off the building and it was quiet. I usually travel with airplugs, because i'm a light sleeper, but i didn't use them.And everything is like it says on the web page. The room is small and has online two hooks where you can hang close. I think it needs, at least, a little tabble (from ikea, maybe). It had a big mirror, central heating and also a portable heater that we didn't use. We had room to our two bags that rested on the floor and we could move around.When you arrive at the hotel, they give you a card. It's the key to your room and necessary also to activate the lights. You've total freedom. You come and go as you please. In the reception, you have machine with chocolats and other goodies and hot tea and coffee.The hotel is very near victoria station, where you have train (including the gatwick express), tube, bus and taxi. You also have in the station a lot of stores where you can eat, ATM, store to exchange money and even a store where you can place bets on any sports. Before 9.30 the tube is very crowded.Returning to London, most certaintly will use this hotel again. It's central location and price are unbeateble."
30,708,"Dec 7 2008 	Budget hotel for short stays	I have lodged at the Easyhotel in Paddington previously, so I knew what to expect when I booked Easyhotel in Victoria. I chose the Victoria hotel since I was travelling by coach. The service is quick and firendly and the room was very clean. However, it is much smaller than Easyhotel Paddington. The room is literally fitted around the bed. If there are two of you travelling with large suitcases you will struggle for space in the windowless rooms. Also, there is no independent air conditioning for the room and I found it very hot on my second night. All that said, you won't find a better budget hotel chain for a couple of nights in the capital. Just plan ahead and book early for the best price."
31,708,"Dec 4 2008 	would stay again	I booked directly with easyhotel as they don't come up on searches. I was only wanting a crash pad and to be honest for the price (53) i wasn't expecting much. Was happily surprised when i got there, the reception staff were friendly and polite and the room was better than i expected. It was clean, warm and bigger than i thought it was going to be! The bathroom was compact but enough room to do what you need + the shower was hot. Word of advice, when ur not using the toilet, keep the lid down as if u drop what your using - it'll fall in!My boyfriend usually stays in more expensive places, but he thought that this was perfect for a one night stay.Will book again."
32,708,"Nov 20 2008 	Ideal for a one night stay	I was in London on business and needed to stay over after attending an evening function close to Victoria Station. I was not keen to pay the outrageous prices of main stream hotels and thought I would give the Easyhotel a whirl at 35 for a room with double bed, small bathroom with shower, just needing bed for the night.Not expecting too much I checked in at 16.00 with a very helpful member of staff who asked if I would prefer a ground floor or 3rd floor room as they had no lift. I went for the 3rd floor and the best way to describe the room is like that of a cabin on an car ferry to France, very small, a &quot;pod style&quot; bathroom like the French motel chains and very clean.I had a small overnight bag and my laptop which I could charge in the room and after coming back to the hotel later that night slept soundly in a bed that for me was pefrectly comfortable. A great location in the middle of London close to the &quot;bright lights&quot; and I will use Easyhotels again, OK the room is &quot;functional&quot; rather than spacious but if you just need a great value stay you cannot go wrong."
33,708,"Nov 12 2008 	Nothing for free	As it says on the hotel website...the rooms are small, so we were expecting that. However we were not expecting to have to pay GBP10 to store our bags for an hour. The pillows and linen were also crap. The pillows were as thin as cardboard and you had to pay extra to get another one. You also only got 1 duvet and had to also pay extra for more. Also don't expect to be able to turn around in the tiny shower without turning the water off. If there are two of you in a room don't expect to be able to move around without bumping into each other. Good location though."
34,708,"Nov 12 2008 	easy hotel Victoria : A Great Launching Pad	Better than expected. Was prepared for a clean, albeit SMALL space that would serve as a resting place during our tour of London. In that capacity, it functioned more than adequately. No lifts .. the 2 days on the front end of our trip were spent on the 3rd floor -- a major piece of work getting luggage up there! Learned from it, and requested ground floor room during the 2 days prior to our UK departure -- so nice. Everything is planned for efficiency -- a very futuristic design. LOVED the magic duvet -- minimum weight and perfectly warm, even when the room was a bit cool. So many great little restaurants/bistros/cafes in close proximity, plus wonderful access to a couple of the greatest theatres in the city."
35,708,"Oct 13 2008 	As expected	Just returned from a two night stay here in room 31 on the first floor. The room was a standard with window, it was about 8 ft wide and about 10 ft long with a bathroom cubicle in the corner. The bed was fine, thin pillows but you can rent more for 2 each and extra towels are 1 each. You do get 2 towels with the room. The shower was good, plenty of hot water, in fact, the little cubicle ended up like a steam room!! Do take the tolilet paper out the bathroom before you se the shower. With the door closed the shower room dried out overnight. Only 2 pegs to hang stuff on, could have done with a little shelf or even a table. The room has one orange wall, and pale peach or the others, so not that bad. Would I stay again - maybe for one or two nights, as just a place to sleep. You just have to remember the room could be small and youget no frills. Oh the shower did have Lux shower gel and handwash."
36,708,"Oct 10 2008 	small small small	This is a hotel for low-budget travellers, definitely! The rooms are soooooooooo small that its hard for 2 people to walk inside it with the suitcases on the floor. The bathroom loooks like an airplane toilet, so small it is. But its clean and the location is awesome, steps from Victoria Station ( one of the main metro and train stations in london) and a lot of touristic sites."
37,708,"Oct 2 2008 	Wouldn't Reccommend	Overall a disappointing stay at Easyhotel for us. Friendly staff which assisted somewhat, however be prepared for the stairs! Very Narrow and difficult lifting so I hope you are fit! (We had 20kgs each in two bags).On arrival we noticed what seemed to be a small cockroach in the room, I killed it without much more thought (thinking you get what you pay for). Sleeping that night was uncomfortable as I felt like I was being biten by mosquito's. In the morning the harsher reality was realised - BED BUGS! They had raped and pillaged me all night. Blood stains on the blankets were evidence of this as well as a few of the cretins crawling in the sheets when we stripped it down. Complaint to the desk was well recieved (as I brought a few of the dead freeloaders with me!), so they moved us to another room (another floor up, more difficult navigation on the stairs!). This compounded with the inadequate air conditoning to keep us from sweating all night (even though the temperature was only 20 degrees outside! Which is cold!) No further complaints on the actual hotel really. It was clean. BEWARE THOUGH- with the size of the rooms (we had a normal room with a window - rooms are as tiny as they say 8 square metres!) not even enoguh room to have both our bags on the floor open at the same time!!! I won't be staying in another Easyhotel again. Shame as the credit they issued for our inconvenience can only be used in the form of credit on a future booking!!!"
38,708,"Oct 1 2008	Everything you could need	Maybe its a little strange to rate this as &quot;5 Star&quot;, but we love this hotel in Victoria. It was very clean, comfortable, and quiet. The Victoria location is great, and because we booked 3 months ahead, it was only 38 pounds per night. Yes, it is very small. We got the absolutely smallest room we could, just so we could have the full &quot;Easyhotel Experience&quot;. It was fine, It calls for a little manuvering - who wants to get out of bed first, because there really isn't room for two people to be standing at the same time. We didn't feel claustraphobic, because the ceilings are suprisingly high. We stayed here for our first two nights in London, before we traveled up to Manchester for a week, then coming back to London, we decided to treat ourselves to a last night in a Hilton. Sure, the Hilton was great, but it costs one hundred pounds more - I think there are just lots better things to spend money on than a hotel room. As an American traveling in Europe, all of the hotel rooms seem small anyway, so the petite size was just no problem. This is a great way to save some money, and we will be staying here the next time we return to London."
39,708,"Sep 19 2008 	would definately return	I stayed at this hotel for one night,i booked a room with a window,it had 2 beds and 2 shower units,so i was pleasantly surprised as i was a single traveller,it was quite spacious.The check in was quick, pleasnt and polite.Check in was 3pm you could leave your bag 5,checkout was 10am,they are quite keen i was knocked at 10.20am no lie in...The hotel is only a 8 min walk to all transportation systems at victoria station.underground,coach and rail.There are numerous restaurants and pubs and supermarkets nearby,M&amp;S simply food(victoria station),Tesco metro, for sandwiches and snacks for travellers on a budget .The hotel is ideally located for sightseeing,I managed to walk to Buckingham palace ,Trafalgar square,Westminster Big Ben and the London Eye (15.50 a ticket) in a short space of time.I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel,remember it is no frills but its only a place to rest up and shower,Where else could you stay at this address Belgrave Road SW.1 for 59 a night."
40,708,"Sep 9 2008 	A comfortable bed and an en-suite what more could I need?	I had a single night stopover in Central London, and a limited budget - easyhotel.com looked to be cheap and a good option.The standard rooms listed on the website as 'small' are just that - standard and small, exactly as widely advertised.The bed almost filled the room, and was comfortable and welcoming. The en-suite shower had plenty of pressure and heat, and was much appreciated.The hotel does offer WiFi connectivity for an additional charge (like everything else), and although I didn't take it up, the signal appeared to be strong and reliable.A stay here is ideal if you want a decent bed for the night, with no extra frills and a low price, which is what the easy group offer and deliver.There are plenty of local amenities in the area if you want food of supplies, and the hotel is close to underground stations and both Victoria Railway &amp; Coach stations."
41,708,"Sep 6 2008 	Cheap but small small small	Does exactly what it says on the tin! Good stuff first:- price is excellent given the location, just around the corner from Victoria station(s) so handy for all the main tourist sites, pubs and breakfast places. Helpful staff and clean room.Onto the bad stuff- our room consited of a small double bed, walkway to bed and shower room. And we had one of the larger rooms, with a window! The shower room is more a wet room with a curtain that keeps some of the spray in. There is no room to dry yourself in there, in fact safely turning a full 360 circle in the shower can be difficult (I bumped the tap and got a nasty burn as a result).Two wall hooks are for storing your belongings as you'll need to maximise the floor space! We had to co-ordinate drying and dressing time after our showers!. Guests are provided with one towel each and one small pillow, you have to pay 5 pday for a tv remote and also to leave luggage before or after your stay.We only stayed two nights and literally spent no more than sleeping time there. We're happy with basic accomodation and while this wasn't bad but I wouldn't recommend it to a mate. For an extra few pounds per night you can get &quot;luxuries&quot; like two pillows, loads of towels, room to be untidy, unlimited tv and free left luggage."
42,708,"Aug 15 2008 	You can do better	I stayed here with my 10 year old son. London is very expensive so a $79 room seemed great. My request for a not-top-floor room was not honored, but I knew this was possible. I also knew everything would cost extra ie TV use, maid service, etc. The staff were not unfriendly but most were not helpful either. My last night request for a wake-up knock was answered with &quot;Don't count on it&quot;. The deal breaker for me, though, was the cold water. The water is only cold, not warm, not hot, not warming up. It's only cold. Our front room was noisy, the rooms are super-tiny. The window opened about 6 inches, the breeze was nice. The a/c was on, and the comforter was warm. This hotel is on a pleasant street, near Victoria stations and several restaurants, etc. We walked home safely at night. Although the tour books and websites stated other hotels on this street had higher rates, I saw several vacancy signs with lower rates posted. If you have no luggage and don't need a shower, this easyHotel could be for you. But you can probably do better. We won't go back."
43,708,"Aug 14 2008 	Warning!	WARNING!If you book with easyHotel, check the small print on their Contract. They do not give any kind of refund, and indeed will give you a &quot;credit&quot;, which is then designed to be difficult to use, and will rapdily be reduced by various hidden fees.Needless to say we had to change a booking with easyHotel due to an unforeseen circumstance, and then was refused any kind of refund.Cheap and nasty operation. Avoid."
44,708,"Aug 10 2008 	Small Inexpensive in Pleasant Convenient Neighborhood	I stayed in the London Victoria easyHotel in early June 2008.Because I was traveling solo for the first part of my trip, I merely needed a small, inexpensive hotel room in a safe, convenient neighborhood.I was very happy with the easyHotel.As advertised, the room was very (VERY!) small, windowless and in a basement area of the hotel . However, this was not a problem as I did not spend much time in the room. The room was mostly clean and the rest of the hotel was also decent.My high-speed Internet connection worked perfectly and allowed me to stay in touch with work back in the United States.The hotel is a very short walk from Victoria Station and the neighborhood consists of nicely-appearing economy bed &amp; breakfasts. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance, as well as a coin laundry two blocks away. For a meal, I was very happy with The Jugged Hare.The hotel is also very convenient to all of London's sightseeing. Each day I set out on foot to explore the city. Whether walking, by bus or by train, it is easy to get to anything from the easyHotel.HOWEVER...as much as I was pleased with the easyHotel accommodations, I know that my wife would not have found them acceptable. She would have loved the neighborhood, but the room was far too small for her comfort. For the budget traveler, room is great...but I wouldn't choose the easyHotel on a honeymoon!If traveling solo to London again (on my own $$), I would definitely give consideration to easyHotel Victoria Station."
45,708,Jul 30 2008 	Awful and dirty	I stayed in this easyhotel on New Years Eve so thankfully i wasn't in it very long. The first room (small no window option) we were given was filthy...it had dirty marks on the bed and little hairs all over the sheets!!! the second was a bit cleaner but the room was incredibly small with a bright orange wall. It was difficult to sleep in and it was also very noisy as the door was paper thin. For one of us to go to the loo the other one had to either stay in the corner of the bed or leave the room.I know that size and day is what i paid for but the quality of the rooms in the easyHotel in Basel are 100 times better. I would not reccomend using this hotel but i would not condem all easyhotels.i think it could possibly be a 'London' thing as many hotels take the mickey in London.On the plus side the hotel was a short walk from Victoria station.
46,708,"Jul 6 2008	Cheap and Cheerful	This is our second visit and this time we went for a larger room with a window rather than the smallest room below ground without a window. Although more expensive, there was a lot more space and well worth the extra. Hotel clean and staff extremely pleasant and helpful. Would certainly use again."
47,708,"Jun 1 2008 	Does what it says on the tin!	Have stayed here many times now as a crash pad in London. Amazed to read people complaining about it! READ THEIR WEBSITE BEFORE YOU BOOK!! It tells you everything you need to know in detail so no-one can be surprised about the size of the rooms, the lack of windows in some of them, the lack of free TV and other 'frills', etc. etc. Apply exactly the same principles to booking this hotel as you would to booking an easyjet flight and don't expect the frills!Positives:- It's cheap! Cheapest I've paid is 30 which for a room in its excellent location is fantastic. The most I've paid is 60 on a very busy evening. The earlier you book, the less you pay...- It's clean and modern. There are other places in the vicinity which are as cheap, but you take your chances with the cleanliness and state of decor- It's surprisingly comfortable. The beds in particular are very comfortable ... and even though the bathrooms are the size of the ones which you get in cross-channel ferry cabins, they are clean and every room has an ensuite- The location is excellent - right near the stations and very near to some great pubs and restaurants to pass the evening inThe negatives are that one or two of the tiniest rooms on the lower ground floor are stifling, as people have pointed out, and the air conditioning is controlled centrally so you can't do anything about it. My advice: don't book the smallest rooms (the web site gives you room dimensions, so they're easy to avoid).Also, if you book a room without a window you should expect that it may feel claustrophobic - but book one with a window instead if that's a problem for you! The smallest rooms are just bigger than ferry cabins, but the largest (e.g. the special needs rooms) are surprisingly spacious. Actually, if all you're after is somewhere to put your head down, the windowless rooms are quieter as there is no road noise. The only noise problems I have found, though, are in rooms near banging doors, so take ear plugs as a contingency.Yes, the decor could be more uplifting (e.g. there are no carpets in the rooms, to avoid the costs of cleaning them, I suppose), and the grey and magnolia paintwork coupled with the 'easygroup' orange is not the most attractive ... but if what you're after is somewhere in a great location to put your head down for the night without costly 'frills', then look no further!"
48,708,"May 23 2008 	cheap clean	Cheap clean nothing to write home about unless to say how cramped it is. people who say you dont want to spend your time in a hotel room, yes that is true, but you also dont want to feel like you are in a coffin when you are asleep. very cheap and clean but wouldnt recommend a stay over 2 nights. we did 5 and it was painfully cramped, we spent most of the time laughing that if one person wanted to get off the bed, the other person had to literally leave the room."
49,708,"May 21 2008 	The Pits!	This place is awful. For the cost you can get a decent hotel, if you shop clever. If you really want to know how prison feels, book away! Otherwise avoid. The room was no bigger than a cleaners cupboard, there were no windows, one uncomfortable bed and a TV up so high you get neck ache. Not even a bed side table, shelf or plank of wood to put you stuff on let alone a wardrobe!"
50,708,"May 6 2008	You get what you pay for!	I've given this hotel 4 out of 5 as you get excellent value for money - 60 a night in the centre of London. I stayed here for two nights over the early May Bank Holiday weekend. Both of which were fine. The location is perfect - just round the corner from Victoria Coach Station and Victoria Rail &amp; Tube Stations. Yes, my room was small but I was well aware of that before I arrived. Yes, the bathroom was tiny and a little awkward to manage, however, easyHotel's website also made me aware of this fact. The room though, was spotlessly clean, relatively quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable - something I've never been able to say for Travelodge! I didn't appreciate having to pay 5 for 24 hours of TV access, however, that was my choice. I barely used the TV so saw the 5 as a waste of cash. I didn't bother for my second night. Basically, don't cough up the 5 unless there's something you really want to watch on TV. I had a second floor room with a window. The heating seemed to be permanently on in the room. This made the room a little stuffy. Being able to open the window was a huge help though. The noise from the street was a little annoying but better than sweating all night. I can't imagine what it must be like without a window! Not good, I reckon. Take the toilet paper out of the bathroom while you shower. I didn't and it got wet. Luckily they had provided two toilet rolls so all was not lost.The left luggage facility was useful. I left my bags in the hotel for almost 12 hours after I checked out. At 5, it's cheaper than the left luggage office in Victoria Train Station! I think Victoria Coach Station may be comparable in price though. The staff were helpful and friendly, however, I didn't need their assistance in between check in and check out. I stayed in the room alone. It may have been more of a tight squeeze had my partner been there too. But at least the bed would have been comfortable.For 60 in central London on a Bank Holiday weekend, you can't do much better for the price - unless you get a great deal on priceline or somewhere else. I haven't posted any pictures as the ones on here are already a fair depiction of easyHotel in Victoria."
51,708,"Apr 26 2008 	Small but clean tidy and a bargain!	We expected the easyhotel standard size room (went for the smallest) to be small, and yes it was. we literally had 3 1/2 walls surrounding our bed and a little corridor to the bathroom and door.But despite this, was it was cheap, great location and extemely clean!Although next time we wont fork out 10 for a window as it was a tiny line of a window at near the cealing, - i couldnt even see out of it standing on the bed, but we were on the top floor.For a stopoff overnight for a concert etc if was perfect!"
52,708,"Apr 25 2008 	Compact Central Surprisingly OK!	Had a night out in London planned so booked here to avoid long train journey home. The room was small, the shower and toilet were cramped but the bed was really comfortable, the room clean and as everyone says for the price you pay for staying in central London I dont think it can be beaten. Would definitely stay here again should the need arise!"
53,708,"Apr 20 2008 	Aa lighter shade of Orange.	Warning Consumer Alert. EasyHotel delivers.Our room was actually quite big. We were expecting a box, but got more of a lovely Orange infused rectangle instead. We were promised a window, and got a whole working French door. Fab!Bathroom, basically a capsule but perfectly suitable as long as you remembered to take the toilet paper out before you start your shower. But still wet toilet paper does the job.Bed was pretty good however pillows were only 1 ply. So we popped down to Argos and picked up a packet of 4 pillows for 5 pounds. If you love Cod and Chips served on a plate with your choice of amber fluid, head down to the Maquis of Westminster, 2 min walk towards the Thames. Close to Victoria station which is your gateway to London. There is also busses and those black cabs. It aint SoHo, but if you take advantage of happy hour you can always get the last tube home. Cheers."
54,708,"Apr 18 2008	35 - bargain	Absolutely fine... spotlessly clean, bed linen and towels nice and fresh and comfortable bed. Booked a special needs room (with window) for more space and glad I did so. Even so, I would stay in a smaller room because it was such good value and great if you have to be at Victoria early in the morning. Slept like a baby..."
55,708,"Apr 2 2008 	Does What it says on the Tin!	Hotel room with window...in Central London, 2 nights ... 70...Enough said?!Oh , ok then. While I respect peoples opinion I am baffled by some comments on here. Yes everything is extra..cleaning, TV, Luggage storage etc etc. But for the price I paid you cant even get a travel Inn for one night in central London never mind two. Its clean,basic and relatively quiet, great location 5 mins walk to Victora train and Tube.If you want fluffy pillows, the TV remote to watch SKY and air con controls in your room then dont come here. If you just want a place to put your head down, thats clean tidy and efficient do come here.Gave it 4 stars because its great value for money."
56,708,"Mar 31 2008 	Did you say tiny	It is tiny, that is certain. But I booked it because I thought is would be clean and safe. It was neither of these.We had a a drunk guy try and get into our room very late at night. He was certain it was his room and tried very hard to get in.Any out break of fire and the place would be our tomb. And this was the only place in Europe I got bitten by bed bugs."
57,708,"Mar 29 2008 	as advertised	Best price we could find for such a clean room and bath, comfortable bed, good location. We had a standard room with window, 2nd floor (3rd floor american). I would recommend the window option, it gives the room some more life, control over temperature if needed, and could save your life in an emergency. This hotel wouldn't come close to passing code for life safety in the USA. There are no sprinklers (some rooms also have no windows), only one exit, their fire doors are made of wood and will not contain a fire for very long. They did however have a fire alarm system which did go off once in the middle of the night for a few seconds-woke us fast, must've been a false alarm.Overall, I feel this was the best hotel that we could afford. The room temperature was perfect even without opening the window. The room was quiet, clean. Downsides: no place for a bag, staff mostly unfriendly except one fellow, no free tv (buttons don't even work unless you pay the extra), no housekeeping unless you want to pay something like 15 pounds extra (bath and room gets dirty in 5 days). I would stay again, especially if it were for a 2-3 days. Maybe you could book twice with a room change to cover more days and get a free housekeeping?"
58,708,"Mar 5 2008 	Hot hot hot at Easyhotel	If you pay peanuts...then you'll get what you expect - a tiny little broom cupboard with a bed in it.We chose the cheapest room which meant we had a basement room with no window. We kinda liked the novelty value of it - the airline-style bathroom cubicle and compact bed, and we knew not to have any expectations - we only wanted a cheap bed for the night.But we just couldn't stand the heat - it was scorching! All night long, the vents blew hot air on us, and with no window or controls, we couldn't do anything about it. We ended up attempting to sleep with the main room door locked open against the bathroom door as it was unbearable, with my partners socks blocking in the vents!!!Pay more and get a better night's sleep somewhere else!"
59,708,"Feb 15 2008 	Exactly what it's advertised as	I read a lot of reviews before I booked this place and some of them had me a little worried but really this place is exactly what it says it is. It's tiny - a bed and a bathroom, but hey - who wants to spend their time in London in a hotel?? All you need is a bed and bathroom! Some people metioned problems with heating, bed bugs, noise, cold showers and I think I remember someone complaining about location.The heating could be a problem as you have no control - but just go for a room with a window and that's sorted! As for bed bugs - fortunately there were none - the place is pretty clean. Noise is a factor but if you are a light sleeper just go out and buy some ear plugs! Or better yet just walk all around London all day and you'll be so tired when you get back that you'll sleep through no matter the noise! The shower did start a little cold but just give it some time and it warms up no worries! As for location - it was fantastic! It is so central everything is close. We only ever used the subway to get to and from the airport. You can easily walk to all the big tourist sites.All in all I was very impressed with it!"
60,708,"Jan 23 2008 	What a dump...	I think the pictures posted by other reviewers on tripadvisor make this hotel look alot nicer than it actually is. I've stayed in nicer youth hostels! I could only decribe this place as a prison. The room was soooooooooooo tiny (and yes i expected it to be tiny) - there was the bed....nowhere to place any objects and only 2 hooks on the wall. The bathroom was just like an aeroplane toilet with a shower - basically it's a wet room so when ure in the shower the whole 'room' gets soaked. It was sooooo cold in the room, there's a few vents blowing a gale but there's a sign in the room saying that the temperature can't be controlled by guests or reception...great.Cold, depressing, tiny, dark and souless - you can find better for the money! You can get good last minute deals at a Holiday Inn Express for the same amount!!!!!!!!!!!"
61,708,"Jan 20 2008 	Cheap and Charmless	I'm a regular at Budget hotels and I've always been a staunch defender of Travelodge who I think provide adequate rooms at a very good rate....but the Easyhotel was a step to far for me.Cheap, yes; clean, certainly but when they say basic they mean it. A bed.....basic bathroom facilities and thats it. You can use the TV if you pay the extra 5 for a remote control! - I found that a bit irritating. There is a very cold souless feel about the place.If you literally just need somewhere to sleep, then its perfectly ok but its not a place you would want to spend any other time in. The location is very good for central London and in fairness, the bed was comfy but I'd advise others to book early and get a good rate on a Travelodge if they can."
62,708,"Jan 5 2008 	Seriously orange but a great budget option	I've stayed at this hotel (same room) twice now and will definitely go back again next time I'm in London and need somewhere clean and cheap to stay.I booked a disabled room (with window) which is probably the largest room in the hotel. It was very basic but clean, comfortable and SO cheap for London. Hopefully the photos will give you a better idea of what the room is like.The hotel is very discreet looking (not bright orange outside!) and very near to the Victoria coach &amp; train/tube station.. just a five minute walk. There are plenty of shops (incl a sainsburys supermarket &amp; starbucks) and a pub nearby and the hotel has a handy vending machine selling sweets/crisps and drinks.The reception staff on both visits were very friendly and helpful and even printed off a map for us as well as giving us directions."
63,708,"Jan 1 2008	The smallest room ever - but amazing value!	We stayed here for 2 nights in early December and the room cost just under 90 for 2 nights, which I thought was amazing for London and previously we had paid over 100 per night elsewhere.The location is good for Victoria coach station (less than 5 minutes) and the train station/tube just 3 minutes away.The room we had was the most basic one, in the basement so no window. When we first arrived we were early (check in after 3pm) so we had to pay 5 to store our bags. We returned after midnight and when we opened the door to the room the hot air just hit us - I went upstairs to the reception to complain and there was a sign on the wall that said that the reception staff couldn't control the heat..not true! Thebuttons were right there on the wall and when I asked him to turn it down he did so immediately, it had been on 28 degrees!! He said other guests had complained it was cold..so I guess you could be in an unlucky situation where the temperature isn't right for you and you end up battling with the reception staff/other guests to get it to an acceptable level. In the basement there are obviously no windows to open if you get too hot! The room was the size of a double bed and about a metre square of space as you walk in, the bathroom 'pod' was straight opposite the door, and was about the size of a small bathtoom in a caravan - but very neatly done and most importantly it was clean. There's a full length mirror and 2 hooks to hang things on, plus we used the door to hand things on too. Not ideal for getting ready to go out, my partner had to sit on the bed whilst I got dressed and then we swapped round -but it was cosy!For the money I couldn't praise it highly enough and we would stay there again, but I probably wouldn't be so tight and I'd pay for a room with a window!!"
64,708,"Jan 1 2008 	The worst hotel I have ever stayed in - don't stay there!	I knew this was going to be basic but even the cheapest of hotels has its limits.The room was in the basement - freezing cold and despite asking several times for the heating to be put on, it was cold and felt damp. No carpet meant it felt even colder and like a hospital (or perhaps a morgue!). Shower was cold in the morning so couldn't even warm up with that.even on a budget, there MUST be better places to stay than this - it is SO bleak, SO small, SO awful that I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone.easyGroup - you have got this SO wrong!"
65,708,"Dec 31 2007 	Very small but fine for one night or two	Room was clean, bed was comfy. Shower was powerful and warm. Don't pick it if you are a large person, or have a lot of luggage, or have mobility problems as there is very, very little space. But for one or two cheap nights where you only plan to sleep there, it is fine.Main part of the room is literally the same size as the bed. The shower room is a small cubicle thing probably designed for a boat. The only space for luggage is the lobby area between bed and door or the window sill (if you have a window). The &quot;standard&quot; room we had was no bigger than the small room we had apart from extra lobby space."
66,708,"Dec 21 2007 	Ideal Location but really really tiny room	We stayed in a no window room for 1 night (for just about 7 hours) before we catch another plane from London to other parts of Europe. The rooms is really so small, smaller than we imagine from the photos of the hotel website. However, its location is just too great, just 5 min walk from Victoria subway, train and coach station. It is also located in a safe area.Its an ideal choice if you just need to take a shower and have a sleep. But dont expect anything more than that."
67,708,"Dec 19 2007 	cheap small but clean and handy	It is what it is- small, clean, close to everything London. Book the disabled room- same price and more room. DOnt book if you want to spend time in your room. For over night business stay its clean and cheap."
68,708,"Dec 15 2007 	Do Not Sleep In 201!!!	Booked a small double with window - on arrival the 'window' was a 6 inch strip under the ceiling that didn't open - actually I don't know if it could open, you couldn't reach it to find out! We figured it would do for the one night we were staying, until we pulled the bed back at 2 am...YUK YUK YUK ok in the interests of good taste I will just say the bed sheet (actually there was no sheet, just a matress protector and by god did it need one) was as disgusting as it could be. (Oh I can't resist - 'Curly' hair from top to bottom of bed, every 2 inches. Yellow stains - I counted 10 seperate stains....I'm not exagerating I promise!!!!)A swift visit to a helpful reception got us a new room, bigger, with a proper window that opened on to the street (oh the luxury!) and a clean bed. Reception honestly did not seem suprised that the bed was full of - well, pubic hair, let's be honest.Just avoid 201 at all costs! And if you are unlucky enough not to be able to change - don't expect to sleep on the floor as there's not enough room to stand, let alone lie down on it! There are loads of hotels in the same street so my advice would be to go somewhere else!Oh, and the coffee machine in reception has without doubt the nastiest coffee I have ever drunk, but there are good cafes just round the corner."
69,708,"Nov 21 2007 	Nice folks serviceable rooms but BED BUGS!	The easyHotel was everything I was expecting, and for the price was definitely a deal in London. The staff were friendly, the location great, and the room was precisely as advertised (just as tiny as you think 6 square meters is).But I was eaten alive while I slept, with itchy bites to show for it for days afterward after I checked out (including one that bit me on my eyelid). Until this trip, bed bugs had always been nothing more than a good-night saying to me (&quot;don't let the bed bugs bite!&quot;). I'm sorry to have been enlightened as to the truth of the matter. They're not fun at all, and the bites take days to go away.If the management can get rid of the bugs, this would be a fine place to stay. I'm afraid that I've been scared away, however. I'll fly EasyJet any day; but I'll be looking to stay somewhere other than EasyHotel next time I'm in London."
70,708,"Nov 13 2007 	Great for Crashing but No Bigger Than A Rabbit Hutch	Hotel was basic but clean, near Victoria Station and all tube networks - a great place for crashing if you are single or with a partner whilst in the big smoke. We had to get a window otherwise we would have felt like we were in a cell.Would stay here again but only for a couple of days as the rooms really are small with no wardrobes or drawers and it would start to grate on you after a while plus the shower is so small and crammed you literally jump and and jump back out as its too much like hard work!Value for money 10 out of 10 though."
71,708,"Oct 24 2007 	Cheap	I stayed in the easyhotel in Victoria for 3 nights in October. We booked a disabled room because my sister has collapsed spinal muscles and has to daily exercises on a flat hard floor. We initially felt really guilty that we might be taking a room from someone who really needed it. When we got to the hotel, there is no way a wheelchair user could have accessed the hotel in a dignified manner. There are steps up to the hotel and down from the fire exit. The room was small so not much room for manouvering.The bedroom was small and the bed was enclosed on three sides so difficult for two people if one person needed to get up in the night. There was a small TV on the wall but we didn't use it. There was also a decent sized sash window. The bed was clean. There were two coat hooks for hanging things, luckily because we got the room we did there was a corner where we could shove our cases out of the way.The bathroom was quite small and all orange, like a wet room. it was only when it got wet that you realised how dirty the floor was. There was no window in the bathroom and it got quite hot and steamed up.The location of the hotel was good, near to Victoria Station Victoria Coach Station and close to lots of bars and restaurants, shops and theatres. It was also walking distance to Buckingham Palace and the surrounding areas.We paid 142 for three nights so 71 each, which seemed very cheap in London. The area felt safe enough to walk around and there are lots of hotels on the same road so lots of tourists. We were on the ground floor, in G7, and it was quite noisy as our room looked out onto the street and busy road. The location definitely makes this hotel worthwhile. Also, I would recommend getting a special needs room. I can't imagine how small a standard room would be. All the rooms around us were special needs but I didn't see a wheelchair user - probably because of the badly planned access!! If you want a romantic getaway I wouldn't recommend it but it was ok for me and my sister - better than a grotty B&amp;B."
72,708,"Sep 19 2007 	A matchbox with great value	When you step into your room at the easyhotel, you stop. Because there just isnt enough room to take another one. At approximately 7 sq.m, our windowless room (we acted cheap  rooms with windows are available, but slightly more expensive) was the smallest weve ever been in. But considering we paid only 29 pounds a night, it was a fantastic deal. The only problem we had was because of the check in time - you can check in to your room only at 3 pm, and we arrived early in the morning, so we had to pay 10 pounds to store our luggage at Victoria station. But even if you add the 10 pounds to the room rate, 39 pounds is still a good deal for a spotless room in central London. The easyhotel Victoria is very well located  its just a five minute walk from Victoria station. Its also spotlessly clean. The bed is quite comfortable and the bathroom is smartly designed  they manage to pack everything into a capsule thats as big as a very small sumo wrestler. Overall, its a safe, clean and cheap place for a night in central London  you definitely cant get a room with your own bathroom for that price in any other hotel.  Its a good option if you dont plan to spend too much time in your room - and if you manage to fit into it. We know people who cant."
73,708,"Sep 18 2007 	No frills no thrills	I booked a regular sized room without a window. The hotel is very close to Victoria station, also the shops., while being located in a pleasant looking fairly quiet street. I was there for the weekend in late May.Room was clean, in good condition. Not much in the way of extra space beyond the path to the bathroom and door from one side of the bed.The bathroom was very small, so small I didn't want to chance using the shower in the morning. There was little hot water the night before.No in room controls for the air conditioning so I found myself waking up feeling cold at several points in the night. Or too hot when the AC wasn't on. There didn't seem to be very good soundproofing to the room, I frequently heard toilets flushing in other rooms.TV was good quality model with good selection of channels. However, it cost extra to view the tv via a 5 remote control purchased from reception.No dining facilities at this hotel, so come prepared (plenty of places to eat or buy food nearby). All the hotel has is a vending machine in reception and that was mostly empty when I saw it.In spite of the negatives, the room was quite good value for the 25 paid and the 5 for TV. Definitely recommended if you're on a budget and don't mind the lack of extra amenities that might come at a slightly higher price at other hotels.Not one for the claustrophobic or those spending the evening in their room though."
74,708,"Sep 12 2007 	Suited our needs would stay here again	I and a friend were in need of cheap accomodation not too far from the centre of London. We stayed in a standard room without windows, for two people. The bed was large enough for two friends to share without any uncomfortableness. The room was small, we knew this, but we managed to place our luggage on the floor anyway. The bathroom was small but fine, it is rare to find such a price AND have your own shower and toilet in London.We ordered access to the TV in our room for around 12 pounds in total (stayed there 4 nights), which worked fine.When we left, we had a wake-up knock on the door (no phone in the room), and the hotel got us a cab for heathrow.All the people we saw who worked there were friendly and helpful, and it is located in a really beautiful street with wide pavements in a very nice part of the city, a couple of minutes walk from the Victoria station.The only drawback that for me would be a reason to NOT stay here, is that you can not regulate the temperature in the room, it is the same for all rooms. The first day it was really cold, but the next three days it was really warm, which was fine in the daytime, but during the night we slept without blankets because i9t was so warm. People who are very temperature-conscious should have this in mind."
