31,2087,"Jun 20 2008 	Very impressed.	Overall was very impressed with this hotel. We were planning to do a holiday on the West Coast of USA with a lot of travelling around and could only stay 1 night in San Francisco so we were not worried about the quality of our hotel just the location. When we arrived we were so pleasantly surprised, the hotel was so much nicer than we expected. The reception was very attractive and our room was clean and tidy. The location was fantastic and it didnt take us very long to walk to Union Square &amp; Lombard Street. When we arrived in our hire car we were able to find the hotel quite easily too. Unfortunately the view from our room was absolutely terrible, however in a city like San Francisco you dont exactly spend all your time sitting in your room admiring the view, so it didnt really matter to us.The Valet parking was quite expensive too, but then we found all parking in San Francisco to be quite expensive, much like most other large cities in the world. At least with the Valet parking they took your car away at the entrance to the hotel and returned it as soon as you requested it, which was much easier than trapesing around trying to find slightly cheaper parking. I would definately recommend this hotel to friends, it is ideal for a city break."
32,2087,"Jun 13 2008 	Disappointed	The hotel is located near by Union Square and Market Street, which was fine. Unfortunately our room was very worn down, and the carpets were disgusting! Internet access costs 5 $ for 5 minutes. There is valet parking for approximately 30 $ pr. day. For breakfast go to Cafe Mason at Mason Street a few minutes walk away."
33,2087,May 12 2008 	Nice hotel value for money	We have just returned from 5 nights at the Hotel Mark Twain and were pleasantly suprised. The hotel is only 2 blocks from Union Square and at only 50 a night there were no complaints from us. Yeh the bathrooms a little small but it's not a problem unless your overweight. When leaving the hotel and heading to Union Square take the next road up and not down as there are a few strange characters hanging around in some areas especially Eddy Street which is 2 blocks down. There are quite alot of homeless people in San Francisco especially in this area but other than asking for spare change they didn't bother us. Don't let it put you off staying here cause its a lovely llittle hotel in a good location.
34,2087,"Apr 23 2008 	Stay away. Unless you are looking for some CRACK	This has to be one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The rooms barely fit 2 people, the elevator is decrepit, the location is horrible. Between the drug dealers, prostitutes and bums on the street I would seriously recommend anyone with a family or wife to look some where else. This nehborhood is not family friendly AT ALL."
35,2087,"Mar 28 2008 	Geat Value Location	This hotel was a pleasant surprise for the CHEAP price. Staff was more than helpful, room was spacious and clean, and location was great for downtown."
36,2087,"Mar 24 2008 	Love the new look	I really do love the new look they have. Very comfortable looking rooms and a very classic homey feel. They completely redesigned it since the last time I was there and it was a very pleasant surprise. The customer service is also second to none. I've had to rebook, reschedule, and completely drop my stays before and was always greeted with a smile.I only rated it above average because of a very large issue I had with the internet. I'm a sys admin so I needed the internet and every time (3 to be exact) I've have connectivity issues where it will route me other places, give me POOR connections, or just not connect at all. I've tried the Ethernet jack and the wireless and have had no luck with a good connection. Great place, but it's not the best place if you're a hard core internet geek, or you need the net for your job."
37,2087,"Mar 3 2008 	If You Like the W Hotels But Your Budget Doesn't You'll Like the Mark Twain	A friend recommended the Mark Twain to me as a great value alternative to the larger hotels. Boy, am I glad I took her advice! The room was small, but clean and recently updated, with some amenities typically found only in more expensive hotels, such as a flat screen TV, ceiling fan, nice wooden hangers not lashed to the closet rail, an in-room safe, and nicer bedding that included a duvet and pretty woolen throws. Happily, the non-smoking room had no trace of smoke smell, unlike other places I have stayed. It was easy walking distance from BART, Union Square, the theater district, cable car lines and lots of good restaurants. The hotel bar was intimate and friendly, serving high quality organic cocktails (yes, organic!). I did not try the neighboring Farm &amp; Field Restaurant, but the menu looked promising (if pricey).A few detracting factors:-Fairly close proximity to the Tenderloin, and the panhandlers and occasional street-level whiffs of urine that go with it. While walking to a nearby restaurant on Geary, I suffered through several, um, &quot;compliments&quot; from male passers-by. The neighboring Hilton also presumably has this problem, though. Panhandling and lowlifes are really a problem in many parts of the city. SF could learn something from Rudy Giuliani...-Despite the Mark Twain's best efforts at updating, it's still an old building with: single pane windows that let in a lot of street noise, old fashioned steam radiators that worked overtime, even when off, necessitating opening the windows, shower water pressure and temperature that varied, and a tiny, tiny elevator (NYC prewar apartment dwellers will feel right at home)-Wi-fi that cost $10/day (guess I'm spoiled by the free Wi-Fi at other hotels)"
38,2087,"Mar 1 2008 	Good old fashioned style hotel in fog-city downtown	This hotel is located in the downtown financial and commercial center of San Francisco, maybe far from the docks and the golden gate, but at a glance to business district, you can walk and appreciate the fog city's skyscrapers and the Italian district is at walking distance. There is also a cable car line station very close, you can see the cable car turning and get in to a pleasant ride passing through Lombard street, to the docks nightlife and touristic area.The hotel hasn't got really any attractive feature... the restaurant is new and quite fashioned, and it has a cheap and really close parking area. The rooms and the passageways are not so fancy... it's clear that this is an old building, somehow reformed and refurbished, we actually didn't find anything that bothered us... it was pretty clean and the personnel was keen on helping for whatever we asked.It is a good solution if you're looking for a cheap solution in a central area (other luxury hotels are located nearby), and a good deal for the money you spend since you're really close to lots of areas of interest. Even if the commercial district is not the main nightlife zone in fog city, we were able to find good bars with live jazz music and lots of restaurants."
39,2087,"Feb 15 2008 	Hotel Mark Twain - Great Hotel Good Location	I stayed at the Hotel Mark Twain from July 2007 to January 2008. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms themselves are nice- comfy bed, good cable. The hotel is located within an easy walk of Union Square. The Fish &amp; Farm restaurant is located in the hotel lobby (though not affiliated with the hotel). Have dinner at the bar one night. Fantastic food and service. Honestly, I can't recommend it highly enough. I had a great stay at the Mark Twain and will stay there whenever I return to the city for work or vacation."
40,2087,"Dec 11 2007	Hotel is lovely but stay away from the restaurant!	A group of us stayed at the Hotel Mark Twain this weekend for the Vikings/49ers game. The hotel is lovely. It has a quaint, European feel. If you're looking for a Four Seasons, you've got the wrong place, but if you're looking for a nice accomodating staff and comfortable beds, this is the place for you.The restaurant, however, is a totally different story. The hotel does not own Fish &amp; Farm so please do not hold the following story against them. One of my friends was in the bar and was very loud, this I freely admit, but the owner came up to the bartender (who was a very kind guy) and said that the entire group was cut off. I had an issue with the fact that the owner couldn't just come in and tell us directly. I agree, my friend was loud. I understand the problem. I had no issue with being cut off (although truthfully, only two people deserved such a thing), I just wanted him to come to me or any member of my group and tell us this directly. When I calmly asked him about this he would not speak to me, he just kept saying &quot;You're done.&quot; I said &quot;I respect that you don't want us in your bar, but could you at least listen to me&quot; and he kept cutting me off and saying no. There were no physical altercations, nobody had done anything to warrant being completely dismissed. It was disrespectful and unprofessional and I will never let anybody I know go to that restaurant ever. I'm working on a movie that films there, I have many friends in the entertainment industry who work in San Francisco quite often and I have a friend who is a radio DJ there. None of them will ever frequent this establishment and they are doing me the favor of spreading the word. But don't blame the Mark Twain Hotel as the staff there is wonderful!"
41,2087,"Dec 4 2007 	Not a nice place	I was there for the Nike Marathon in October with 2 other groups of people. The carpets were worn in the older section of the hotel and the whole place needed a paint job. the ONE elevator held about 2 people and their luggage, very small. No Air Conditioning, but they don't seem to mention that anywhere on their website. Dude, the A/C is not just to keep a room cool...it's to circulate the air in the rooms as well!!! If you step outside, you WILL DEFINITELY BE HARRASSED BY STREET PEOPLE! There was one man drinking a beer out of a paper bag and eating something while he leaned against the front of the hotel about 10 feet from the front doorman. I don't have a problem with homeless, but streetpeople are different....they are there hustling in the streets because they want to, not because they have to. In the one-block surrounding the hotel, I saw one prostitute, one schizophrenic (&quot;the cameras are watching ALL of us....who owns the cameras? They know...they know..&quot;), one hustler selling old newspapers, and about 15-20 'beggars.' The only saving grace was the owner/manager of the new restaurant in the hotel who was dilligent in shoo-ing all these street people away. There was human waste on the sidewalks, fights every night and sirens ALL NIGHT LONG. Bring ear plugs. There is no A/C so you can't drown out the noise. It was a really run down crap hole. Stay at your own risk!"
42,2087,"Nov 30 2007 	A very comfortable stay.	I'm surprised to see all the negative reviews for this hotel! My husband and I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of October, and had a very pleasant experience. The staff was polite, the valet service was prompt, and our room was clean. I found the bed to be one of the more comfortable that I've slept on. I was especially pleased with the comforter, which was just the right weight and wasn't made out of that awful slippery fabric that plagues most hotels in this price range. Yes, the elevator was small, but it's not like that can really be fixed! And yes, there were some colorful people out on the streets, but I would much rather spend my vacation around locals than crowds of tourists. My husband and I walked all over the city during our trip and I never felt in any danger. We had a nice rooftop view of the surrounding buildings, and the wooden shutters were a good touch. I would definitely stay here again, and would recommed this hotel to anyone who's looking for a place with character. Oh, and one more thing we liked: the Mark Twain quotes etched in the windows on every floor in the stairwell!"
43,2087,"Nov 7 2007	clean it up	Although the service and staff was great and the front of the house was nice. The back of the house was horrible. The room needed painting, it needed new carpet, it was plain gross, the bed linens looked liked theywere never washed. We ran out of hot water two mornings in a row.Clean it up!"
44,2087,"Oct 31 2007 	Stay away	I've just spent 4 nights at the Hotel Mark Twain, totally without sleep, so this may be somewhat disjointed.1. This hotel is located in a heavy drug neighborhood. There is a &quot;center&quot; (meth clinic, I suspect) downstairs. There are panhandlers who accoust you every few steps and those who are stoned lying around the sidewalks. Vomit and even feces are on the sidewalk and doorsteps. We were afraid to leave the hotel after dark.2. All night, every night, there are screams, literally blood curdling screams, coming from the street and from the alley my room faced. Women screaming, men yelling [--] all night, other yelling that I couldn't make the words out (thankfully). The police sirens, most of which stopped right outside, kept me awake as well.3. This hotel is heated with steam. Each room has a radiator. The hotel turns the heat on only between 5am and 6 pm. So when I came back to the hotel early (to try to sleep) it was freezing. But when they turn the heat on, the clanking of the radiator and the continual gushing of the steam, provided more reason for no sleep. I asked everyday for someone to fix it - no one did.4. I asked for a 7 am wake up call; it came at 5 am.5. There is one tiny elevator - already discussed. It is filthy. There was a lump under the carpet, I kept wondering if it were a dead rat.I used to love San Francisco but now I don't know if I will ever return.That's all I have right now; I have to get some sleep."
45,2087,"Oct 24 2007 	Just Okay - Rooms Are Tiny	We picked this hotel because of its price and close proximity to Union Square. After reading the other reviews on this site, I got very concerned about staying there, but it really wasn't that bad. There were four of us in the city for the Nike Women's Half Marathon, so we just got one room for the night. The price was $205 a night, which was all that we really wanted to pay for just a bed to sleep in for 8 hours. We opened the door and our first thought was how small the room was. There were two small beds and a bathroom only big enough for one at a time. Bedding desperately needs to be replaced and the place just looks worn and in need of renovation. On top of that, our windows looked out onto nothing.It was a busy weekend, but the front desk was unprepared. It took forever to get someone first to park our car, and then to get it out when we left. Even to ask a question or check in, there was a long line.If you're looking for someplace to crash near Union Square, this place is fine. However, if you plan to spend time in your room, I would really look elsewhere."
46,2087,"Oct 6 2007 	It was OK	We recently stayed at the Mark Twain Hotel on Taylor St. in San Francisco. Many of the reviews written here on this website are accurate. It IS an older place. It has a local charm, but not a lot of amenities. The elevator is only big enough for 2-3 people without luggage! The desk personnel are excellent, however. They gave us tips on catching local transportation and advised us on great eateries. (The Taylor St. Cafe next door is wonderful for a filling breakfast. If there's a line; it's worth the wait.) September in SF is a great time for a visit. The weather was spectacular; however, the room was hot; there's no A/C, and the windows only open a few inches. The TV in the room only had 4-5 channels, so if you're looking for anything special, you won't find it here. The radiator had no &quot;on/off&quot; controls. The bar and restaurant downstairs near the lobby were undergoing renovations, so they were not open for business at all. The hotel itself is within walking distance of several bus-lines, but nothing passes directly in front of the hotel door. Taxis are easy to find because the Mark Twain is directly across the street from the larger and more famous Hilton. About 2 blocks away is the somewhat unsavory Tenderloin District, so people should avoid that area as much as possible, especially at night. There are lots and lots of &quot;street&quot; people in San Francisco; we were surprised by that aspect. One of our primary reasons for visiting SF this time of year was for MLB. To get to AT&amp;T Park from the hotel is a matter of walking to Powell&amp;Market in order to catch the 'trains' to the embarcadero area, not so bad in the daytime, but after the game, stay on well-lit streets. Would I recommend the MT Hotel? Maybe, depending on your attitude and needs..."
47,2087,Sep 27 2007	Warning: Don't stay here!	This is a dump. Spend the extra money to stay at the HIlton. It is really not worth spending your money on this place. I didn't get any sleep since the rooms were so muggy and I couldn't open my window since it was on a fire escape. I almost ate one nights stay to stay at another hotel it was so bad. Definitely not worth a dime. I would say this is a 1-2 star hotel. A Quality Suites or Motel 6 is better!
48,2087,"Aug 28 2007 	OK for price in SF.	Booked this one via internet and on price v stars.Its locality is good for trams and shopping.The little cafe next door is first rate and serves top breakfasts.Hotel location is just into poorer areas of SF but experienced no real problems.Hotel rooms were only fair.Beds seemed hard and fittings in bedroom were old and worn.Glowing light switch illuminated room when all lights off and really annoyed me when trying to sleep.My room had a fair amount of cracked and peeling paint.Noise seems to travel in this hotel and doors are not engineered to block out hall lights.Bathroom was fairly small but clean with decent towels.Shower a little difficult to operate but worked well. staff were helpful and friendly with advice .Parking is addtional and $26 per night which is an obvious hidden cost..,"
49,2087,"Aug 17 2007 	Disappointing	We were a total of 4 families looking for a hotel in the city close to some of the main sightseeing areas of San Francisco or within close distance to public transportation. We thought we had found it with Mark Twain. However, the hotel itself is in need of upgrading. We knew we were staying in an older hotel, but it was ridiculous. The one and only elevator is small and slow. To just get one family up to their room with their luggage took some effort. It was just me, my husband and my two young kids with our bags and we were crampt in the elevator. The other 3 families had to take more trips because they had teenagers that took more space. Needless to say, just settling in the hotel was a long process. When we opened the door to our room, we were absolutely surprised. Our room was crampt with furniture and the beds. Hardly any room to move around. I question wether the room should have been allowed to hold 2 double beds. The closet was also very small and practically imposible to hold our belongings comfortably. The furniture and the beds were in good condition and comfortable, but the rooms themselves, the hallways, and definitely the elevator has much room for improvement. We were supposed to have stayed here 3 nights, we checked out on our second night and should have done it sooner. Public transportation was not so close to the hotel, specially when walking around with kids and definitely not a place you want to walk around during the night to get to the hotel.-"
50,2087,"Jul 15 2007 	The Surprise Next Door	Not at all what my family and I expected...but there was a surprising eatery next door that made the trip worthwhile. We wanted to look for an affordable place for the weekend and so we stummbled upon Hotel Mark Twain but little did we know that this place was going to be a challenging journey. We asked for a room at the high end level thinking we were going to get a nice view of the city, but we ended up getting a wonderful view of a concrete wall. The ONE elevator that they did have couldn't even accomadate my entire family so we ended up climbing up and down six flights of stairs several times during our stay. The paint job in our room obviously looked like the work of an amateur. They had this border around the wall's features that would glow in the dark, that not only looked tacky from an aesthetic point of view but also disrupted my family's sleep. On the plus side we found a wonderful little cafe with the most delicious breakfast. The portions were enormous, the coffee was piping hot and the service was spectacular. Overall I would not touch Hotel Mark Twain with a 10 foot pole!"
51,2087,"May 25 2007 	Old World Charm and Personal Staff	The Hotel Mark Twain is a small hotel near Union Square in San Fran. I got an incredibly good rate there after contacting the hotel directly. To be honest, I was a little concerned because the rate was so good but I had never been to or seen the hotel except online. When I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel had recently been renovated, and i got a decent sized room with good lighting. The room had a coffee maker etc and, even better, a small refrigerator. The hotel is not fancy in the sense of a Ritz Carlton, but it is small and peresonal and has old world charm to it. It has a lot of character. The staff was amazingly friendly. I spent almost two weeks there, and they knew my name and my room and constantly asked about my trip and so on. They were unbelievably personal about directing me to restaurants and events of my liking in the city. I would happily stay at this hotel again in the future."
52,2087,"May 10 2007 	Wonderful Mark Twain	The Mark Twain is centrally located to Union Square, Theatres, downtown shopping and the local Muni system that can take you to all the sites in SF, This hotel has recently been renovated and has comfortable rooms and friendly, helpful staff. the price is right. Can't wait to go back for another get away in our favorite city SF."
53,2087,Apr 30 2007	Great customer service	The front desk clerk was nice and the hotel seemed to be in the middle of everything.
54,2087,"Apr 23 2007 	Perfect place to stay!	My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a week, and it was the perfect place to stay for our first trip to San Francisco. The room was great as it had a historic feel to it, but also had a flat screen TV and an IPOD player. Our room was cleaned every day regardless of the time we left the room (a couple days pretty late!). The staff was wonderful, they had great information, and were very helpful in helping us book many tourist attractions, including the wine tours. We also received many tips on places to eat, shop and drink. (Ask for Kevin who gave us most of our information!). This was great cause nether of us had been to the area before. The location seemed to be in the center of everything we wanted to do, so we walked just about everywhere we wanted to go. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Fran, and when we travel out there again, it is where we are staying."
55,2087,"Feb 4 2007	The Mark Twain Is Truly A Taste Of Classic San Francisco!	How to describe the Mark Twain Hotel?? Well, I consider the Mark Twain a TRUE San Francisco Classic! We were greeted with a friendly smile and the best customer service we had seen in a long long time! We felt so welcome right from the start! The woman at the front desk was fantastic and I have to also mention that we were lucky enough to meet the Sales Manager, Kevin too! He is truly an asset to the hotel! His love for his city really shows and he exhibits by far, the BEST customer service I have experienced! I have trained many people in customer service and Kevin would be rated the absolute top in the business!The hotel itself has a quaint, lovely atmosphere! It simply showed me that the olde San Francisco class still exists! Our room was wonderful! The room faced Taylor street and yes, we did hear some traffic outside, but that is part of life in the heart of the City! San Francisco pulses with life! After all, the PEOPLE ARE San Francisco! They are its never ending charm! Even the homeless are curtious and if you don't want to give to them, they simply smile and say &quot;thank you anyway!&quot; We found that from the cab drivers, to the homeless, ALL take pride in their city! So refreshing! If you want complete quiet and solitude, I suggest you take a holiday in the mountains rather than in a great city like San Francisco. Our room was decorated with olde San Francisco Charm and was quite comfortable! Large room and we loved the walk in closet! Big Bathroom as well! Such a deal for the price! The old radiator hissed out tales of the olde City and put out more than enough heat! The Mark Twain is truly an asset to San Francisco, if you want Class, Charm and great Service, than this is the hotel for you! We WILL stay again and again at the Mark Twain! We truly now have left our hearts in San Francisco! At the Hotel Mark Twain, of course!"
56,2087,"Jan 28 2007	Not a good location	We picked this hotel on the basis of price, so it was our own fault. The bed linen and bath towels were clean. The rooms were dull in decoration, no air conditioning or fans in the rooms. The only ventilation was lifting the window a couple of inches from the bottom, therefore the bathroom ran in condensation. The heating only worked late evening until early morning and the radiator jumped off the floor about an inch. The staff were helpful and polite. The internet facility in the reception area had limited availability. The price we paid was far more than we would have been charged if we booked directly.Once it gets dark, we would not be out, too many homeless people in the doorways and begging for money and food. If we went back to San Francisco, we would stay in the Fishermans Wharf area. The Muni system of bus/tram is excellent at $1.50 per person any distance and transfers are valid too."
57,2087,"Jan 21 2007 	Better stay at Hilton across the road	The service was good. However, the towels were not there, when we checked in ( around 3pm). I have called the reception and have been told that the towels were in the laundry and would be brought to the room in a few hours. When we came back at about 8pm, there were still no towels. After a 2nd phone call, the towels were brought. To crown it all, great location! However, I would recommend to stay at Hilton nearby."
58,2087,"Nov 4 2006 	Fair value great location.	Hi,Hi stayed there for the Oracle Open World 2006 convention from October 21 to 28.There were no major problem with this place. The room was clean for the exception of the vent in the bathroom that could have use a deep cleaning. There were also some small stains on the carpet but overall it was fine.The room have a lot of space if you compare to other hotel in the area that have very small room (King George!). But I must mention that they have no A/C in the room so it could get very warm if the weather is hot. You can always open the windows, but if you do be aware that you open it for the bugs too !The fridge in the room was really appreciated. I also enjoyed the big walk-in closet where you have a safe that you could use for free.I asked for a quiet room not facing Taylor street and they put me in the back on the second floor (room #214) and it was perfect. Another guy that works with me had a room facing Taylor on the 4th floor and he did experience some trouble with the noise at night but I was never bother by the noise.And finally, the staff was great. Gary, Christina and Jasmine at the front desk were very helpfull and were always ready to help you for whatever you needed. They provided me with directions, ideas, suggestion for visits, etc...Gary was always trying to make your stay the best experience you could have, even when he was pretty busy you would never see his smile disappear.I would go back there not because of the room because I am sure I could find a lot of room equivalent or better in the area, but because of the great staff."
59,2087,"Oct 1 2006	Oh dear. Dear oh dear.	Had a suite here for a night in September 06. Insufficient towels, smelly bathroom, indifferent service (no answer to housekeeping or reception for about 10 minutes when trying to solve the towels problem). Recommend avoiding if possible."
60,2087,"Sep 22 2006 	Not impressed...very old	I checked in and was very disappointed. The lobby was charming, but I could barely fit my medium-sized suitcase thru the elevator door. The first room I checked into was not attractive, had pipes running on the outsides of the walls and a nasty vent in the bathroom that looked 100 years old. The shower was dingy and small and there was no bathtub. I asked for a nicer room and was less than pleased with the second option. There was no air conditioning and the street noise was too loud to leave the window open. I checked out immediately without even knowing if I would receive a refund and went to the beautiful Hilton across the street. Fortunately they had rooms available and I enjoyed a pleasant slumber in a clean, modernized room."
61,2087,"May 5 2006	get a room Not Facing Taylor Street!	The hotel Mark Twain is a boutique hotel situated behind the Hilton Hotel. However, in SF, a block away does make a difference. The room was clean, there is a restaurant on the bottom floor of the hotel, and there is a fitness center off of the lobby. That's the plus side of the Mark Twain.The negative comment? WHATEVER YOU DO, GET A ROOM THAT FACES AWAY FROM TAYLOR STREET! People are yelling outside the hotel until one thirty in the morning. The Hilton deliveries are carried out in front of the Mark Twain, so you hear the garbage truck (and other trucks) roar up at all hours. Also, Greyhound buses are picking up and dropping off passengers on Taylor Street beginning at 5 am. One evening, there seemed to be a drag race taking place out on Taylor Street at about 4 a.m. I am used to some noise. I live near a freeway in Honolulu, so I am no stranger to the sound of traffic. However, I left the Mark Twain exhausted due to lack of sleep. Also, always turn left as you leave the lobby on to the street. After you hit Taylor Street, take your first right onto O'Farrell Street. Otherwise, you will find yourself in a fairly spooky part of town. There are other boutique hotels nearby that are quieter, feel safer and don't cost much more. This is a second choice, rather than a first."
62,2087,"Apr 29 2006	Would not stay here or recommend...	Upon returning to San Francisco for our last 2 nights stay we decided to try our luck with the HMT. Firstly i must big up the fantastic breakfast cafe called Taylors next door to this hotel, this was voted one of San Francisco's best breakfast places and the food is next to none! But you have to pay in cash. Anyway, if i'm honest the front desk were polite, knew their info but i would not stay at this hotel again. The price is ok and for the location too is handy but i disliked our room intensely. And we didn't spend hardly any time in our room. The lift is v tiny and extremely slow. Everything from the carpets were v dated too and the decor and even though we got a free viewing of our room before committing i was disappointed. The size of our room was average, dull colours and strange shutters instead of curtains which let in drafts. The bedlinen was old and flimsey, the bathroom ridiculously tiny, and you could see by the paint cracks, mould appearing that alot of remodernising is needed. Also i am a stickler for basic cleanliness and hygiene and noticed, dust dirt in the bathroom under the mirror along the wall. Worse when i picked up a new face towel and found 2 different coloured hairs on it disgusting! The room smelt too probably due to the age of the carpets and hotel, i requested a quiet room and what i got was at 4am every day the full volume of the dustbin truck complete with siren noises disturb my sleep, also the walls are paper thin and i heard the tv, someone on their mobile's conversation as well as them showering or turning on their fawcets. A real disappointment and unfortunately will never recommend or stay here again."
63,2087,"Mar 31 2006	Quit Your Complaining!	I will start by saying that I was a bit concerned booking a stay at this hotel based on prior reviews, although most of them were from October or so 2005. I was meeting a friend from Seattle who had meeting at the Spanish Consulate on Sutter Street, so I needed a hotel in the area that was within walking distance from everything and that is exactly what I got at Hotel Mark Twain. The reason I was concerned is that in addition to myself, my two sons, ages 10 and 3, along with my wife were accompanying me.The location was right on and although it is near the part of town where my buddies and I used to go when we were in high school and college to get in trouble, I felt comfortable and safe the entire stay. I found street parking about three blocks away although it would have been much easier to just use the valet at $30. When walking around I saw other places from $15 to $25. Having lived in downtown Seattle for seven years, the urban streets did not intimidate us. As long as you just walk, mind your own business, and be polite if asked anything, you will have absolutely no problems. There is also a Walgreens one block up, which is convenient as I had a cold and forgot my medicine. There are many restaurants in the area that will certainly please you and the restaurant next to the hotel (I think it it named Taylor Street Cafe) was one of the best breakfast places I have eaten in a while. Beware, it only takes cash though. The Warfield Theatre is only three blocks away only with Union Square.The front desk staff were very nice and I was checked in promptly. The room was good enough for the two day stay. I am not sure why some people are so concerned about the room size and stuff like that. Even though I was there with my kids, I still spent very little time in the room. The bathroom was clean and nice and everything worked like it was supposed to.The elevator was, as reviewed, a little small, but my friend I was meeting, who is European, said that the elevator was actually twice as big as the ones over there. I made a mental note that when I finally do make to to Europe, I will double check the elevator specifications. The only real disappointment was the bar downstairs. I was expecting alittle more night life there, but after dinner when we returned to the hotel, we went to get some drinks and socialize. They had no one there and when someone did arrive, they only had beer and wine. I am a margarita man, so we just went up one block and had a good time. It will not affect my future stay, but if you are thinking of bringing the party back to the hotel, you may be disappointed as well. Check out went just as smooth as check in and within minutes, we were on road back to Sacramento. I will be coming to S.F. about every other month for a weekend and will certainly use this hotel."
64,2087,"Mar 28 2006	9 Days at the Mark Twain SFO	My wife and I spent 9 nights at the Mark Twain and found it to be good value for the money.It's an older hotel, and shows its age in places, but it was clean, comfortable, and certainly a very convenient base for looking around SFO. Public transport is close by, and it's a very short walk to Union Square. The staff were excellent to deal with and were always willing to provide advice and assistance.In other reviews I read of security/safety issues. We never felt threatened at any time of the day or night. There are &quot;poor folk&quot; in the neighbourhood, but any refusal to contribute was accepted with grace.We would certainly stay again."
65,2087,"Nov 4 2005	Solid Value - European Feel	Great value for SF! No, this is not the Hilton. It is the classic old hotel that has been reworked over the years. Rooms/bath are small by midwest american standards but would be right on the mark if you were traveling thru europe. Linen service was great. Rooms were clean. Paint was showing some wear in bath room but crews were busy reworking rooms on our floor. Front desk staff was more than happy to help when asked but were quiet and reserved otherwise. Two blocks from great shopping. Nice little breakfast/lunch place next door. If you want to LIVE in this room you should probably look else where. If you want a room to SLEEP in after a long day of site seeing and shopping, this is the place. And at 1/3 the Hilton price I would return."
66,2087,"Oct 2 2005 	Ok but you can probably do better.	The hotel is faily clean with a good location. That's about all that can be said for it. The desk staff ranges from friendly and inept to rude an inept. The standard room (which Hotels books) is hardly big enough for the bed to go into. Upon viewing this room, I asked about an upgrade. They told me that since I'd booked through Hotels, there could be no upgrade. When I was ready to leave, they said they could upgrade me to a &quot;Jr. Suite&quot; for an additional $75 a night. Add this to the $100 a night I'd already paid, and I'm only $25 away from staying at a really nice hotel, like the Hilton across the street. So, this place is really no bargain.Best part: LocationWorst parts: Front desk staff who really doesn't know ANYTHING. I asked for a spoon one night to eat some hard-packed ice cream, and the front desk clerk REFUSED to give me a spoon. I've never seen a hotel that would refuse a guest such a simple, basic, reasonable request. The elevator is tiny and very slow. If you try to take the stairs, be careful. The stairs are not even big enough to put your whole foot on--a real safety hazard."
67,2087,"Oct 1 2005	Don't Stay Here!!	I count booking a room at this hotel among the dumber things I have done in my life, so I attempt to salvage something useful from my experience in the hope that others will learn from my mistake. My story: I arrived in SF on a Friday after spending the latter part of the work week at a conference in Sacramento. I was very tired and looking forward to a good night's rest followed by a pleasant but short stay in SF.The first thing that went wrong had to do with the reservation. I had booked this room over an Internet website specializing in hotels. When I made my reservation I requested a smoking room. Well, lo and behold, when I arrived they had no record of my request and made little effort to mitigate the situation beyond reciting the &quot;no guarantees&quot; policy as if from rote memorization. I did not make a big deal about it but, mindful of my fatigue and the hotel's noisy location, did ask for a quiet room in the hotel's interior, on an upper floor.The next sign that something was rotten was waiting what seemed like an eternity for the tiny little elevator to arrive. I had to stuff myself in there along with three German tourists. Exiting the elevator on the eighth floor, it was immediately apparent that the owners had invested most of their money in fixing up the lobby. All of the interior was painted a drab, ugly yellow and smelled musty and dusty, with cheap decor reminiscent of a boarding house. Even beyond all this, the room still managed to disappoint. Room was very, very small with paper-thin walls. The people next door (who were smoking up a storm in their room) were watching a movie on the TV at what seemed like full volume, with tire-squealing car chases interspersed with what sounded like orgasmic moans coming through the wall and blaring out into the hotel's interior. There was no air conditioning and hardly any breeze (surprising, considering that it was very windy that day). Windows of the room directly faced windows of a room across the interior. The queen bed was way too short and covered with a cheap, thin spread. There were marks on the walls and stains on the carpet. In the dark and tiny bathroom I could hear my neighbor turning the faucet on and off, and from a vent above the shower I could hear clanging coming up the pipes from the hotel restaurant kitchen.I knew I would hate every minute of staying at the Hotel Mark Twain. Between the noisy neighbors and the stagnant, smelly room I did not believe I would be able to sleep there, either. I went across the street to the Hilton and booked a room for that night (beautiful and clean, with a spectacular East Bay view).I attempted to get a refund for at least one night, to no avail. My feeling is that &quot;bait and switch&quot; for them is a common and accepted business practice, with no remorse for the guests they disappoint and displease from fraudulent advertising and insufficient accommodations. All staff seemed to be able to do was recite booking policies and tell me that I should have called the hotel directly. I suppose that, from their perspective, you are treated with the contempt you deserve for booking online and thus avoiding paying the full price.I have stayed at boutique hotels before, and I can accept the lack of modern conveniences as part of the experience, as long as standards of quality service and accommodation are maintained. In my experience, the HMT presented all of the inconveniences of a boutique hotel, and none of its advantages. The Hotel Mark Twain is like a tacky, cheap impersonization of it betters (and there are many for nearly the same price, so avoid this one and stay somewhere else)."
68,2087,"Sep 8 2005	A Perdect Fit	I take note that the negative reviews of this property are from a majority US clientel. As an overseas visitor the Mark Twain met our needs to a tee. If it's the Hilton your looking for walk accross the road. The hotel is not new but has been redecorated to include that old world feel with a mixture of modern tones. Very palatable. Yes the lift is small but then we took the stairs. The room was adequate. Clean, roomy and had all that was required for a four night stay. Well located close to Powell St station and Union Square. For any Aussies travelling to SF, who are not wanting to pay a fortune and are prepared to accept a step back in time without too much of a penalty the Mark Twain is a good choice. We will be return customers."
69,2087,"Aug 14 2005	Terrible - Could not wait for the time to check out!!	It was musty, no air conditioner, no wash cloths. Could not wait to check out. Would not recomment it to anyone. The bathroom was tiny only had room for 1 person at a time to be in it. The shower reminded me of one that was in a campsite. Not clean- black mildew around the bottom."
70,2087,"Aug 13 2005	A good base	This hotel is in a convenient location and made a very good base for seeing San Francisco. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was nothing special, but was clean and of a good size. The location was fine, but make sure you get there by the most direct route form Union Square (powell street, and then O'Farrell Street. Don't wander into the surrounding Tenderloin district- the extent of homelessness and poverty there is shocking.Overall, very good value for money"
71,2087,"Jul 31 2005	Run Away	The walls are paper thin and this hotel is far too noisy. This is especially a concern because the hotel borders a rather seedy part of town. The first day we arrived we needed a nap due to a four am flight. We had housekeeping enter our room despite a do not disturb sign to interrupt our much needed sleep. Then we endured the extremely loud conversations of the same staff in the hall as they cleaned. Needless to say we did not get the rest we'd intended. Our night time sleep attempts were interrupted by pimps yelling at prostitutes outside, noisy neighbors, sirens and garbage trucks. I came home from vacation exhausted and determined to steer as many people away from this hotel as possible. Pay more and stay somewhere else, it's not worth the lower price."
72,2087,"Jun 15 2005	Management and Employees refuse to solve your problems and deal dishonestly	I chose this Hotel to celebrate my 25th anniversary during my visit to San Francisco and it was a terribel experience.I stayed there for 4 days and during my first day after I went out for a few hours I couldn't open the electronic door of my room. It took sometime before an employee really went to check with me that the electronic door was not working and they had to call an engineer to deal with it.Meanwhile they had to place me in another room, but the thing was - they promised I could get my stuff early in the morning (my bags, my clothes, my passport and documents - everything that I had was in that room), and the in the morning they told me that the engineer had never appeared during the night, but they would call him and then in the afternoon I would be able to go to my room and get my stuff again.Fact, when I returned in the late afternoon - nothing, no one had moved a finger to open my room and allow me to get my stuff. They made a new promise that I would be able to do it by the next morning, but I could see they were not being honest in their &quot;talk&quot; about trying to solve my problem.New morning.... nothing absolutely done. They had done nothing to open my room.... Worse, in the third evening, I wasn't still able to go to my room, and you can imagine my worry about my passport and documents, and the fact I had not been able to change clothes for more than 2 days. Worse, I couldn't even check-out of this bad hotel to find another one, since they had my passport and clothes with them.Only in the 3rd morning did I find an employee that realized that my problem was indeed serious and deserved immediate attention. I asked to see the manager and see promised to refund my credit card in 2 days (since I had prepaid my stay), but one month passed and the refund never appeared.I politely called to the Hotel and asked for the manager on the phone, and she just hang up on me! What I think makes it all worse is that I realized that my misfortunes were more than just the result of mere laziness and forgetfulness - they were just the normal act of a dishonest and unprofessional management. The Manager definitelly lacks any care or interest in the clients troubles, and deals rudely and dishonestly with them, promising to solve problems that she never intends to deal with."
73,2087,"May 25 2005 	Terrible--Never Again	Upon our recent visit to San Francisco for the American Association of Orthodontists Convention we stayed at this hotel. We were very dissatisfied with the hotels service and conditions. The advertising for this hotel is very decieving. The rooms were filthy, there were cobwebs around the ceiling, mold in the corners of the shower, the paint on the walls was falling off. The walls were very dirty. The toilet took 4-5 flushes. One outlet on the wall by the window. To iron you had to stand on the bed. The outlets in the bathroom were on the opposite of the mirror so you had to rest your curling iron or hairdryer on the toilet causing an electrical scare. The carpet was old and worn. There was about an one inch gap under our door. No air conditioning, no hair dryers in the room as it is stated. For being a newly renovated hotel, I think they forgot to do alot. Their elevator has to be the smallest we have ever seen. We were just able to get 2 people with our luggage in it. No more than 4 people could fit in it comfortably (without any luggage). We did ask for the manager, who was not there at that time. She did call us back and leave us a message that had nothing to do with our complaints. We would not recommend this hotel, unless they actually did do some renovations. Also, the walls are paper thin. If your neighbor took a shower the same time you did, be careful of the change in water temperatures. It was not in a very pleasant part of town either. So, if you wanted your window open (no air condiditoning remember), you had to put up with the people yelling outside."

91,2087,Jan 5 2008 	Ottima scelta per visitare Frisco
1,2088,"Nov 17 2009 	Value for money	This was a good hotel, fairly central location. A large room which had a fridge and microwave in it which was very handy. The breakfast was sufficient with plenty of choice. The bed was clean and comfortable. The staff were extrememly helpful and I would recommnd this hotel."
2,2088,"Nov 17 2009 	Great value hotel in San Francisco	We had a great stay here. Staff were really friendly from the moment we arrived and had to park illegally out the front to check in. They reassured us that was okay and gave us details of the nearby valet parking lot they refer to.Our room was spacious, clean and well appointed. The WIFI was really slow, but there are shared computers available with faster internet if necessary. Location was great - safe to walk around at night and plenty of restaurants nearby. More than enough tasty food available at continental breakast each day.If we ever find ourselves in San Francisco again we'll definitely return to the Mayflower."
3,2088,"Oct 25 2009 	Excellent value with fantastic service	The Mayflower Hotel was an excellent choice. We arrived at the Maflower after a long flight from Sydney Australia. We were greated by the hotel reception staff who went out of their way to ensure all our needs were met. The family room we had booked was very clean and very comfortable including the beds.Nancy the owner went out of her way to assist us purchase some family tickets to see the San Francisco 49ers. We could not purchase these tickets in Australia and Nancy helped us out and even followed up after the game to see whether we had a good time. The Mayflower met all our needs in every way, a great location, excellent hotel staff and a very comfortable room. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are on a budget and after clean and safe place in San Francisco."
4,2088,"Oct 8 2009 	Good Value Hotel nothing fancy	Hotel Mayflower is a great choice if you are traveling on a budget and want to be close to the center of San Francisco. There is not much going on on the street itself, but it is a short walk to Nob Hill, Chinatown, Union Square and all of the public transportation. Booking the hotel was very easy, as was check in, etc - and the price really couldn't be beat - especially in San Francisco where there are so many expensive hotels. I saw two rooms - both were very spacious, clean, but a little run down (which is fine for me) - the only complaint I have is that the hotel smelled a bit musty, or overly like cleaning products, but I opened my window and it was fine. I also wanted to change rooms when I got there and the manager was very accommodating and moved other people around so I would feel comfortable.A big plus of this hotel is the continental breakfast which is included. It has the usual - toast, coffee, tea - but also everyday there was some fresh home-made baked goods that were delicious - coffee cake, pecan cake, lemon poppy-seed bread, cookies, muffins. That was a lovely touch.Also, Free Wifi!This is really a great choice, just don't expect anything too fancy."
5,2088,"Oct 7 2009 	My place to stay in San Francisco	Very good price for San Francisco. The staff of the hotel is very nice and always happy to help you with anything: they suggest good restaurant and give advice for things to see/visit. You have a good breakfast with toast, muffin, coffee, juice, fruits etc. and a free access to Internet and computers. Rooms are clean and comfortable."
6,2088,"Sep 28 2009 	Good... for the price	There was nothing very outstanding about our room, which looked like it was last redecorated in about 1970, or indedd about the broadband internet which (though free) was very patchy. But for $100 a night, in the centre of SFO, you can't very well complain."
7,2088,"Sep 28 2009 	This is the Hotel in S.F	This trip was to see a family member at SF Medical Center and a little sightseeing. We parked our car in the garage, and headed to our room. We loved the old style elevators. Our room was clean, comfortable and had everthing to make your stay complete. The view was great and the room was beautiful. The market next door has everything we needed. We walked to Union Square and had dinner. The next morning we went and had a lovely lite breakfast downstairs and walked to China town. Where the hotel is located made it easy to walk to all of the places we wanted to go, and we felt very safe in the surrounding area. Definitely worth the location and highly recommended!"
8,2088,"Sep 16 2009 	We were surprised and thrilled - best value for SF	Our daughter is a student at AAU &amp; we had to help find her an apartment. We checked many hotels &amp; rates before choosing the Mayflower, mostly for price, the highest recommend rate &amp; central location. We arrived early morning &amp; they gave us a room anyway, stayed 2 days &amp; extended over the weekend, then another day while waiting for the rent application. It was absolutely wonderful; family owned, great (and helpful) staff, ample parking (but VERY narrow access), a small free breakfast every day got us on our way, spacious and comfortable rooms and beds, a small kitchen area and a clean bathroom!, etc. made this the best value for the price. They even change towels &amp; sheets every day. Our only minor problem was a squeaky ceiling fan (even forgot to tell them at checkout). There is a small store next door (convenient for groceries), and many pubs, pizza and other restaurants, sandwich shops, coffee houses, etc nearby, the bus stops around the corner, cable car a few blocks over, very close to everything. This was a diamond-in-the-rough, a blessing to come back to after walking all over SF looking for apartments every day!! We can't understand how they would ever get a bad review, but we definitely recommend and look forward to staying there again.p.s. I happened to call their number direct to ask about the parking and got THEIR rate which was less! (i.e. don't book them online and save your money)"
9,2088,"Sep 2 2009 	Excellent customer service and good location	Family of 5 from The Netherlands;We stayed 2 nights in The Mayflower Hotel with an excellent breakfast, serving everything you need before exploring San Francisco. The building is old but still in good condition and has its own charm. The rooms are clean and reasonable sized. The traffic noise is very limited in the rooms. When checking in we already found out the staff was very helpful with a basic city-map to find the way outside, to assist with bus-lines and stopping times and much more. This is a place to feel relaxed while nearby attractive places in the city. We wished to stay longer to see more of this interesting city. We recommend this place to other visitors!"
10,2088,"Sep 1 2009 	Bang for your buck	Not the most fancy hotel but very quaint! It has an older feel but I would not call it outdated. Breakfast was good and location was great. Don't spend extra for a &quot;city view&quot;, there was not much of one."
11,2088,"Aug 31 2009 	older style but very nice	When you first walk in you can see the character of the hotel. The front desk lady was very friendly and let us check in early around 7ish. The elevators are the old style with folding cage and hinged doors... very small space. The room is not up to date but clean. There is a microwave, sink, fridge, plates, coffee mugs, and utensils, and a large walk in closet. The breakfast was simple, self serve, and free... coffee, hot chocolate, toast, muffins, oatmeal, peanut butter jelly. 7-10am i think.We walked to union square everyday which was about 3 to 4 blocks... and hilly. From there you can catch most transport. Or there are many bus lines that go near the hotel. The area seemed safe... we walked a lot and never had any trouble. They say not to go into tenderloin which is nearby.If you dont like car noise then ask for the other side. We stayed on the street side and could hear cars but not so much that i minded."
12,2088,"Aug 24 2009 	It's so nice!!!	A good place!!! Clean, confortable e really near Powell Street"
13,2088,"Aug 21 2009 	Star Hotel	I am recently back from a month of solo-travelling in California.The Mayflower Hotel was my favourite accommodation that I used during this visit.As I was using public transport, location was an essential factor when choosing accommodation. Mayflower is a 15-minute (slightly uphill) walk from the Greyhound bus station. It is only a 5-minute walk from the Powell Street cable car.The hotel staff were very friendly throughout and helped me solve two problems. Firstly, my mobile charger (from the UK) was faulty, but I was quickkly supplied with an American one that had been left behind by another guest. Secondly, I was finding it difficult to upload photos on one of the three available computers. A computer technician was soon called and a solution found! Such help and support made me feel very welccome, so much so that I booked a further night.The hotel is kept in good condition. Breakfast is basic but better than you will find in other places. Overall, this hotel is a gem and well worth booking."
14,2088,"Aug 18 2009 	Pleasant surprise	Stayed for almost a week with partner in this downtown hotel while doing research, attending a conference, and doing some sightseeing. Cost and location were big influences in making the reservation. We expected something &quot;decent,&quot; but for the most part it was a pleasant surprise.The staff were incredibly helpful at check-in and throughout the stay, giving tips about the surrounding area including where to park for cheap (the hotel does have some limited parking of its own but there is a fee). Our hotel room was on the top floor, facing the next-door residential building so not exactly a room with a view (unless you're a voyeur) but the windows were screened and a nice breeze came through with them open. There was some noise from people living in the other building (and perhaps other hotel rooms with open windows) but not disturbingly loud - we had no problems sleeping.The building/rooms are old but partially remodeled - nice carpet and tile, LOTS of closet space, spacious bathroom, kitchenette area with microwave and minifridge. Quaint murals throughout the hotel, including in the rooms (rooms are named based on landmarks in the city, with a matching mural in the room). We had a &quot;deluxe queen&quot; room which was quite spacious with a small seating area, desk, and TV armoire. The rooms are not AC climate controlled (not unusual in SF) but with the fan and open windows we were quite comfortable (and there was a warm spell while there).Neither of us were impressed with the continental breakfast - mostly carbs and nothing mouthwatering.We had problems with the wireless internet not being available the first morning but after speaking with the front desk it was fixed and no further problems during the trip.The hotel is convenient to most of the downtown area and many public transportation options. It is a bit of a hike to the fisherman's wharf area but we did walk it one day and it was pleasant (though we rode back on the trolley). The front desk did point out to us when we checked in that the tenderloin area is somewhat nearby and what areas to avoid - we had no problems."
15,2088,Aug 8 2009 	Cozy hotel with family spirit	The hotel is nicely situated dowh town SF. We stayed for 4 nights and from the beginning to end we felt the hotel family spirit. Especially the home made cake for breakfast had a special personal touch. No industrial hotel food here. Free access to 4 Internet pc's was a strong asset.
16,2088,Aug 5 2009 	Great hotel no negatives whatsoever	Great hotel really enjoyed our short stay there. We had the suite and it was very nice decorated and very clean. Staff were lovely and extremely helpful. Would recommend it to anyone. Very central and very handy for shopping. There's a small grocery store right next door to the hotel and all the bigger shops are within walking distance.
17,2088,"Jul 13 2009 	Great experience overall and great value recommended	Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The price is fantastic, and great value. The room was big, and the bathroom fine. One small thing was that the 'top' ornamental pillow cases had obviously been used by a previous guest and not cleaned, because there were hairs on them. But no biggie. It's great to have a free breakfast, which is very unusual in the US, but view it more as something to get the day started rather than a big feed. There are computers with internet that are free to use, which is very useful, but be aware that the computers are not virus protected, and I nearly feel victim to an ebay/paypal virus- so I would advise you not to use the computers to enter any sensitive information. But overall, great hotel, great location and very friendly owner. Recommended."
18,2088,"Jul 9 2009 	Still the best kept secret in San Francisco	Stayed at the Mayflower two years ago travelling back to Asutralia from Canada.So it was a 'no brainer' to stay there again this year, with my wife and daughter.Great staff - great location - great value.Do yourself a favour - when in San Francisco, stay at the Mayflower."
19,2088,"Jun 26 2009 	Great Hotel -- Parking is Mr. Toad's Wild Ride	The Mayflower is a throwback to a time most of us don't remember; when a hotel was a nice place to stay, not part of the 'HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY.&quot; It's a wonderful, quaint old hotel that's very clean and in excellent repair, with friendly people who are more than willing to accommodate. I stayed here while touring colleges with my 17-year-old daughter and she loved it. There's a little market next door if you need to pick up some snacks or refreshments. Location is great -- we walked to Fisherman's Wharf (through Chinatown) and back, but it's a whopper of a hill and I don't recommend it unless you're out of shape. The garage is right out of an &quot;Untouchables&quot; episode...I dare you to pull in there in anything larger than a rental &quot;compact&quot; car. I was suspicious of the 1920s plumbing, but when I fired a pipe-jammer down the hatch, it disappeared no-questions-asked. Enjoy a great breakfast at Sears just a few blocks away. Stay at the Mayflower, you'll love it."
20,2088,"May 16 2009 	Great location character and very clean	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It was clean, comfortable and very close to all the action. It was also v handy to have free internet located on a very nice balcony above reception. It was an old hotel but i didn't mind. The only true gripe i had with the hotel was the manner of one of the receptionists which was 'cool' and fairly non-communicative but i was probably a bit grumpy myself having travelled for the last 24 hours previous!"
21,2088,"May 2 2009 	Friendly and helpful staff and wonderful ambience	The hotel is old but has been preserved well and retains much of its original character. It is not one of those large hotels that make you feel like just another faceless guest and it is built in such way that there is a more homely, personable aspect.The hotel is nowhere near the Tenderloin so you don't have to worry about panhandlers harassing your family for change. It's located near Chinatown and we enjoyed the walk there. I can't comment on public transport because we drove to the other locations but if you drive a compact car with side mirrors that can be folded in, you can park in their garage for free. If you have a bigger vehicle, you have to park it at a nearby garage for a fee. I did a thorough search on tripadvisor for hotels as we were travelling with a 10 month old and I needed a microwave and a refrigerator and this was only one of two hotels in downtown San Francisco listed on tripadvisor that provided both. They also provide plates and utensils and cups.An earlier review commented on the bathroom tiles but I didn't notice anything wrong with their bathrooms. Because the room and bathroom are very, very clean, I was fine with letting my baby crawl all over the carpet and bathing her in the bath tub. We requested for a room on the quiet side and it was really quiet.The service was also impeccable. I had informed them earlier about needing a crib and Esther had both a pack and play and a toddler bed ready for me to choose from. The next morning, when we entered the dining hall for breakfast, the high chair (a very nice one!) was already there ready for us to use. What I like most about this hotel is that the staff clearly take pride in what they do and pay attention to details to the extent of providing sweets at the front desk for their guests which is just what you need after a long day of sightseeing."
22,2088,"Apr 19 2009 	different types of bathrooms	o.k. folks, after all those enthusiastic reviews on this place i was very surprised when i arrived, because the room was average but the bath was very sleezy. old, old, old, lots of broken tiles etc. when i rechecked tripadvisor after my return i found these pictures of a very nice bathroom there, but that was not like the one i had. so beware that some rooms are renovated and others are not at all. location was very good though, breakfast o.k. but dont expect a place with an atmosphere like the picture of lobby on their homepage pretends to be!! well yeahh roomservice didnt show up after the first nite."
23,2088,"Apr 18 2009	Real Gem!	I stayed at Hotel Mayflower from 1-3 April with my 17 yr old daughter. One of the oldest hotels in SF, the hotel has real character and a truly magnificent lobby as you enter. If you want 4-5 star this may not be the place for you, but if, like me, you prefer hotels with some &quot;local&quot; character and none of the anonymity of the big chains, this is the place for you. Fantastically friendly and helpful staff who are more than willing to help out with maps, hairdryers, cork screws, etc. etc. at no extra charge. Free Internet on the gallery overlooking the fabulous lobby also a nice touch. Rooms and bathroom facilities obviously old, but well renovated and clean and, once again, full of character and hugely comfortable beds. :o) In keeping with a tip on Tripadvisor, I asked for a room at the back and it was wonderfully quiet and peaceful. Rooms include small kitchenette with fridge and microwave.Breakfast is included (rare in US !) - very basic but everything you need, particularly yummy home-baked cookies and cake :o).I took taxi from airport and after getting stuck in traffic paid $60 for the luxury. Had I realised how close the BART was (4 relatively close by) I could have saved a fortune. And if you have a load of luggage, you can still grab a cab from the BART station for a couple of dollars.4-5 minutes walk to Union square and the famous cable car line, this place is in a great location. Had a great meal about 50 yards down the road on the other side of the road at &quot;Cafe Mozart&quot; where they do a nice &quot;light supper&quot;. Supermarket super convenient directly next door with ATM. I can't recommend this place enough - GREAT value for money, GREAT location and GREAT staff. Will definitely be my port of call if I find myself in SF again."
24,2088,"Apr 7 2009	Stay here	My 90 yr old mother were visiting San Francisco to see the play &quot;Wicked&quot; at the Orphium theatre. We spent the night at the Hotel Mayflower. We chose this Hotel based on location and Trip advisor reviews. We couldn't have made a better choice. The location was central and not scarey after dark. The room was spacious including a sink, counter, microwave, and mini fridge. There was a table with two chairs. The bathroom had a full bathtub. The beds were firm, the bedding and pillows were comfortable. Our room (517) was quiet, hardly any street noise. The staff was polite and helpful. A local restaurant &quot;Uncle Vinney's&quot; will deliver food to your room. There was a nice dining room breakfast area. The breakfast was included and offered bakery type pastries, toasted breads, cheese, fruit, tea, coffee, milk and juice. There is a nice grocery store/deli right next door. We found it easy to hail a taxi, or the desk will call one for you. It was historic, and beautiful. Built in 1929 it was clean and in good shape. Definately stay here."
25,2088,"Mar 31 2009 	A great value hotel in a beautiful city	We stayed at the Mayflower for 5 nights in March and had a wonderful time. The location is perfect only a 10 minute walk from the heart of things. The room was large, roomy and clean. Our room was located on the 5th floor so little traffic noise was heard. Staff friendly, polite and very helpful. I loved San Francisco and loved my time at the Mayflower and would love to return and stay there again."
26,2088,"Feb 27 2009 	Great little gem	We stayed here for four nights in January 2009. This place is great and I would recommend it to others. The staff are really helpful, breakfast good, rooms nice (a little older) and the big bonus, free internet. There's a great little deli next door if you need a few supplies or some nice sandwiches made up, also 2 coin laundries really close. There's also a nice little Italian place down the road a little for tea. If you're after somewhere that's central and well priced then this is your place."
27,2088,"Feb 4 2009 	Excellent value	Arrived in San Francisco after a long but pleasant drive through Yosemite National Park. I was there in August and the 1st thing I noticed was the drop in temperature. On the Weds I had driven through Death Valley and it was 54C. I got into SF and it was 16C. Anyway. Check in was very quick and efficient and they even remembered that I was 'the Englishman that had asked for a quiet room'. The lifts are right next to reception and you are straight up to your room. The rooms were dated in comparison to some that I had stayed in during my road trip from New York to San Francisco but they were clean, big and comfy. There is a small kitchenette in each room but I didnt use it but I'm sure it would be handy for some travellers.The staff fall over themselves to help you and they have A4 printed maps of SF that show all the transport system and they help you with where you need to get on and off. If you are there for a few days then ask them where you get a multi day transport pass.. I was there from Thurs tea time until Sun morning so I just walked everywhere.I had tickets for the ball game at AT&amp;T Park on the Friday and decided to walk it. Hmmmmm...there are some 'interesting' areas with a 5 min walk in the wrong direction but I'm a big chap so wasntt bothered. All towns have rough areas. The area around teh hotel though is fine and no trouble at all. You are a 5 or 10 min walk to Union Square and from there you are into Chinatown. Ask ayt the reception to mark on the map Gant street as there is the oldest bar in SF called the Saloon and Friday and Saturday nigts it is rammed out as they have live blues groups on and the place is tiny !There is a car park at the hotel butr if your car is bigger than a cigarette packet it wont fit. There is a car park within a 2 min walk that charges by the hour or day but I only had to park overnight as I was handing my car back the following morning.Breakfast was fine. Just what you needed. A large room with lots of coffee, juices, cakes etc etc.Would I stay there again...definitely.When you are leaving ask them the night before to book you on the picjk up shuttle for the airport. It was about $10 and I was the only one on it !Great hotel in a great town"
28,2088,"Dec 2 2008 	Classic rooms with a friendly staff great breakfast	I had a stay for several weeks at the Mayflower. Cost and location were my deciding factors. My first room was overlooking Bush street. LOTS of sun, light, people watching - I loved it. I was not dissapointed and was pleasantly surprised with the easy feel of the place.Regarding the bathrooms (and kitchens) - they are old but the owners seem to be retaining a lot of the original feel of the original features. There are original porcelain floor and wall tiles and design details in many instances from many many years ago. When they have had to cut into a wall to modernize, I noticed someone paid a lot of attention to carefully matching modern tiles and grout such that the average person may not notice. In my opinion, this kind of bathroom is more interesting than what you would find in any modern hotel. I like to see the patina of wear and appreciate the fine craftsmanship that set all those little porcelain tiles so many years ago. Cleanliness was not an issue.I found the rooms very clean and of good size. The street side room became quite an issue by the third day as at night the street noise started to bug me. (they have to retain the old originial windows on the facade) On the third night I requested a quieter room which they showed me to in the back of the hotel. It was great - until they started remodeling the room next door. No matter - they offered to change my room again but I declined as I was out in the city during most the day. Otherwise this room near the back was very quiet at night. Someone made homemade goodies for breakfast too. In addition the the regular cereal, bread and such, cookies appeared some days and breakfast cakes on others. Gotta try the cinnimon bread toast with butter - yum. The clientele in the morning was a nice mix of Americans, some foreign travellers, and some retired folks. There was a small kitchen with mirowave &amp; refrigerator in my room. It had minimal items to make lunch and a simple supper. There is a great market right downstairs and to the left with groceries and some prepared items. A medditerranean flair to the food and they stocked Champagne too!"
29,2088,"Nov 20 2008 	Great Weekend	My spouse and I stayed at The Mayflower last weekend on the recommendation of a friend. Check in was a breeze. When we got to our 6th floor room, which was on the sunny side of the building, it was quite warm. We called the desk to see what could be done. No problem...the manager (who is also the owner's daughter) met us on the 6th floor, and escorted us to a much more comfortable room on the opposite side of the building. Personal service like this is quite rare these days. The rest of the weekend was comparable, with consistently above expectations service. Our room was spotless, comfortable and quiet. We would recommend The Mayflower to all travelers."
30,2088,"Nov 11 2008 	Hotel Mayflower: felt comfortable good service very clean lovely history	I stayed at Hotel Mayflower for 3 nights starting October 23, 2008 and found the reviews in Traveladvisor helpful in gauging my expectations. I was very happy with this hotel.  After reading the reviews, my expectation was that the Hotel Mayflower would be an older hotel with the feel of a bed and breakfast. As I entered, I was impressed with the comfortable, friendly and personable assistance and greetings provide as I checked in and throughout my stay. Hester (front desk) is amazing but all the managers made every effort to be as helpful as possible. The room I stayed in, their 'standard', was roomy and felt extremely clean at an unbelievable price for a mid-city hotel. I had a friend visit me during my stay who went so far as to check for dust on top of some of the pipes visible in the hallway-no dust-we were impressed. Hotel Mayflower opened in 1929, but it wears it age well. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the towels clean and more plush than expected even with the raves from tripadvisor reviews. The kitchenette area, also clean and usefully appointed included provided cutlery, plates mugs, and glasses. The tub in my bathroom was deep, and all was extremely clean to the eye and touch. The walk in closet was immense; about 6 feet deep and 4 feet wide-smelling slightly musty but not prohibitively. I was surprised.  I loved the features in the room that spoke to the hotel's early days, the old no longer used gaslight features on the wall, the parquet floor in the bathroom, and the arched entry from the bedroom towards the door and bathroom. The sense of a well loved and cared for hotel also is evident in the decor of the lobby and the ceiling of the lobby. Check out the elevator, which is older-style lift, I especially liked how quiet it was, no blaring beeps.Other reviews made comments about things like grout on the tub that had some minor cracking--yes, I saw it too but I have seen less than perfect grout in many of the more modern hotels I have stayed in (Hyatts included) with that problem.  The continental breakfast was satisfying. I was able to make toast with a variety of toppings, and either cheese or hard boiled eggs were available for those who want more protein. The coffee was hearty and the orange juice was good (definitely not from concentrate). I especially liked that there was a baked extra, like oatmeal raisin cookies, or muffins. The food is laid out in a room furnished with simpler tables and chairs but there was a plasma television and again, the place felt friendly. The neighborhood was quiet and absolutely no problem, about two blocks from the bustle of Union Square and very close to many forms of public transportation. The room was quiet, I had my windows and fan whirring constantly because I was there during the warmer fall weather and found the arrangement comfortable. The need to open windows might be a concern for those folks who have small energetic children and they should ask questions about window height if you stay during warm weather. Just as a note to those inclined to be surprised by no air conditioning: the lack of air conditioning is common for older hotels in SF. You want air conditioning at these prices, go to a Travellodge, or pay more and go to the more modern and expensive hotels. You lose something though; it is older hotels that give a visitor a sense of place and history. I like that. If I had a laptop the internet access would have been free. I was able to use computers availible to guests. I did not use a car during my stay so I cannot speak to the parking that the Mayflower provides. I wish I had pics of the murals on every floor of the staircase or the elevator. The ones attached a few views of the room, the lobby, and the guest sitting area.I felt completely at home during my stay there and would happily return."
31,2088,"Nov 7 2008 	Better than expected stay	We arrived before noon and they were able to check us in early as the rooms were ready. (I need to add that the check-out time is 1pm,not the usual 11am) The location, supermarket and spacious room (with microwave and fridge) was a good bargain. We had no trouble with the area's security and felt safe in the neighbourhood at night.Breakfast was good. We were not expecting much from &quot;free continental breakfast&quot; - maybe some juice, toasted bread/bagels and coffee, but the spread was a nice surprise, with cakes, cereals, etc.The hotel comes with a caged lift and it gives us a quaint, homely feel to this hotel. This is a family-run hotel and they have certainly made my stay homely!"
32,2088,"Oct 22 2008 	Great stay great staff great location!!	Upon arrival, check in was quick and easy and we had no problem getting our stuff in th lift and finding our room. The room was spacious with a good sized and comfortable bed, a small kitchenette and a small but spotless and functional bathroom. The kitchenette had dishes, cutlery, glases, a sink, a microwave and a small fridge. This addition to the room was greatly welcomed as it meant that we could buy supplies and eat in the room instead of eating out all the time. We couldn't have been happier. Reception staff couldn't help enough and were happy to answer all manner of questions and reccomend attractions and routes to them.Breakfast is served downstairs at no extra charge and although it is limited, it is more than enough to set you up for a day. There was tea and coffee, fruit, porridge, toast, cheeses, juice and sponge cakes when we were there and we really did enjoy it every morning!The hotel has a grocery store just next door that is open til about midnight. This proved very handy for buying bits and pieces and the occasional late night bottle of wine! It is located in the Nob Hill area and is extremely well connected to the rest of the city. Walking distance to most places, we walked a lot and it was a great way to see parts of the city you would otherwise miss if you were on the bus. (An A4 street map is available from reception and it served us very well on our whole trip) There is also loads of bus stops nearby, most of which have route maps and timetables posted inside them. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from a cable car stop (Hyde Line) that will take you directly to Fisherman's Wharf via a few other landmarks. The cable car is not a fast or efficient method of trasport but it is good fun and worth a try at least once! The hotel is also a 5 - 7 minute walk from Union Square and all the shops which is handy but not great for the credit card :)I was worried about the area that the hotel was in because of its close proximity to The Tenderloin (About 10 minute walk) but we really liked the area and never ever felt unsafe, even at night and we had no issues with walking back late at night. The lady at reception gave us a map and kindly marked a cross on the Tenderloin area and advised us not to go there at night, we appreciated this extra thought very much!!We left San Francisco to visit Las Vegas and Santa Cruz and had planned on booking different hotels on each return but we liked the Mayflower so much that we re-booked each time. Re-booking was no problem and on the third room change we had two double beds at no extra cost. All of the rooms were comfy and spotless! I would not hesitate in reccomending tis hotel to anyone and if I am every lucky enough to visit San Francisco again, I will definitely stay here!!"
33,2088,"Oct 21 2008 	Great location and great hotel	The Hotel Mayflower is perfectly situated in an area of San Francisco that is close to many of the best tourist attractions--Union Square, Moscone Center, Nob Hill, Fishermans Wharf, Chinatown, and Japantown. We actually walked to all these places, and the walks were both invigorating and surprisingly short. Take the Hyde Street cable car back from Fishermans Wharf to the hotel. It drops you off only two blocks away at Powell &amp; Bush.Service at the hotel was excellent. The owners are very friendly and accommodating. The room was certainly big enough and had THREE large closets. Yes, the rooms smell a bit musty, but there's no mold. And the inner rooms shelter you quite a bit from the street noise. As for the garage...the entrance is tight and getting into it should be done from a traffic lane, NOT from the parking area right in front of the hotel. Your car should be no bigger than a Toyota Matrix or Pontiac Vibe--otherwise it will scrape against the walls of the entrance. Once inside the garage, however, you have plenty of maneuvering room. And there are In &amp; Out privileges!"
34,2088,"Oct 16 2008 	nice room 	I've been there for 4 nights; I was on my own.The experience has been definetively positive. Nice and very large room &amp; bath;Clean;wi-fi + 4 PCs connected to the internet, to be used for free;breakfast is ok;the position is very convenient, as you have union square, chinatown and the cable car, all at a walking distance.-The neighborhoods are ok, even during night.The staff is friendly.Cons-The building shows its age in some things (old lift, windows). Avoid however the area of Tenderloin, at about 10 mins walking from the hotel (the area is between Market St and Larkin St to the south, Geary St and Larkin St to the northwest), as you will find there many beggers and many not-so-nice faces :-)"
35,2088,"Oct 16 2008	a flower	an old renovated building.nice room, nice breakfast, nice price.good location."
36,2088,Oct 16 2008 	Good budget hotel choice	Staff were friendly and welcoming. The rooms I stayed in were were clean and very spacious. Would book a room there again for sure!
37,2088,"Oct 13 2008 	Great atmosphere	Hotel Mayflower was a great choice for budget accom. right in downtown San Francisco. We stayed for 4 nights, the reception was really friendly and welcoming, the decor very original, a very good first impression.Our room was large and spacious, with kitchenette, and very clean. Breakfast in dining room was average, the owner went to some trouble to source some ingredients to deal with allergy.The hotel has been in the same family since it was built, and there is a real sense of pride. It is an old hotel, and hasn't had much renovation, but that only added to its charm.Would definately recommend this place."
38,2088,"Sep 30 2008	UNBELIEVABLE towels	After reading some reviews of the Mayflower we decided to book ourselves in and save some money (we had originally contacted the Hol Inn Fishermans Wharf about staying there) - we ended up paying just over half the amount of the Hol Inn and glad in our hotel choice!The Mayflower is located just a few blocks from Union Square (5 minute walk) so is ideally situated to all the action. Rooms are superb, with a good sized main area, a small kitchen, and a nicely proportioned bathroom. We didnt really use the kitchen apart from the fridge to keep drinks cool, but if you were staying here and wanted to cook yourself, you would have no problems there!The free internet access is great and the free continental breakfast was a nice touch - sets you up for the dayThe thing that will live in my mind forever about this hotel though will be the towels! I have never smelt better towels! I (along with the other 3 members of our party) actually looked forward to having showers so we could get to use the fresh towels that had been laid out - we should have swiped some of the fabric conditioner and brought it home with us!I would have no hesitation in staying here again, as the location is good, the staff extremely friendly and helpful, and most importantly, the price is very very good value!"
39,2088,Sep 26 2008 	Pleasant stay	Very pleasant stay in the Mayflower. Rooms were spacious and clean. Staff were friendly espeically Hester at reception. Very well located as is close to Union Square.
40,2088,"Sep 16 2008 	A San Francisco Treasure	Hotel Mayflower is a San Francisco treasure. It is comfortable, affordable, clean, very conveniently located, and with outstanding customer service. I extended my stay from a couple of nights to a couple of months for business purposes, and loved the spacious room (brand-new mattresses), fully equipped kitchenette, spotless bathroom and professional and friendly staff. This historic hotel is perfect for both business (free internet access and separate study on first floor mezzanine) and pleasure, with Union Square shopping, theaters, restaurants and public transport within short walking distance. The complimentary breakfast is served in a beautiful airy dining room, where I felt equally welcome to read the newspaper alone or chat with the other guests. I would especially recommend the Mayflower to travellers from abroad (like myself) who wish to have convenient access to everything this city has to offer and to stay in a hotel that reflects the history of the city while providing the comforts of today. This is a family owned hotel, evident from the careful maintenance of the building (new wiring, plumbing, windows and fresh paint when I was there). It is also evident from the consideration they show their guests. They accommodated any request and did everything they could to make my stay there successful and pleasurable. I have visited the city repeatedly over the past twenty years, and this is by far my favourite place to stay."
41,2088,"Sep 1 2008 	Quaint but familiar...	I spent one night at this hotel in Oct 2006 and when I was returning to SF last month called to make reservations.No single or standard rooms were available so I was only able to get a room with a queen size bed for about 125.00 plus taxes a night.I arrived at the hotel around 1:45pm although check-in was at 3:00pm. The check-in process was quick and easy and I was able to leave my bag in the luggage room while I went to get something to eat.When I returned a few hours later, the room was ready and I was pleased. The room was clean and bright, had a kitchenette with a fridge ( which I made use of ), a microwave, glasses, mugs , cereal bowls and cutlery. The bathroom, although old, was clean, with sweet -smelling towels and fresh toiletries.During my stay I partook of the continental breakfast which consisted of orange juice, tea and coffee,butter, peanut butter, apple sauce, apples, cake, and a choice of multi-grain bread or white bread. It was self-service so you could eat as much or as little as you wanted. The breakfast was filling and a great money saver.The location is within walking distance to shopping, restaurants,and the cable cars.There is also a coin laundry nearby and a food mart next door. There was internet access in the room I stayed in as well as 3 computers for guests use, in the upstairs lobby area.The staff is friendly and helpful without being intrusive. Overall I enjoyed staying in the Mayflower Hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again."
42,2088,"Aug 19 2008 	Welcoming!	Excellent for Quality/price. On our arrival, the staff was very welcoming! I booked a standard room which had a private bathroom and a kitchen too! Everything was very clean! I was surprised when the staff told me that breakfast was included in the price! Breakfast was good too (continental breakfast). I will definitely recommend this place to my friends!"
43,2088,"Jul 26 2008 	Great Hotel Great Location Great Price!	Great Staff too! At first I was afraid this would be close to the tenderloin district. It's Nowhere close to tenderloin... it's far far away. It's on a safe street. Has a grocery store and a couple of laundromats very close-by. Also close to many tourist attractions. Close to Union Square, Grace Cathedral, both cable car routes, the list goes on. Hotel is very well situated.I had a great 5 night stay. My room was spacious, with a walk-in closet, very clean, with a kitchenette. Free breakfast (I'm not going to complain about free food), free computers with internet and a printer.The only thing that wasn't great was that the phone in my room didn't work. But the staff were friendly and I got their help in what I needed to do. Plus with the internet, I didn't miss the phone.This is a clean, proper hotel but at a fraction of the cost. This is the ONLY place I will go to when I go back to San Francisco."
44,2088,Jul 13 2008	Good enough stay	I liked the hotel overall but thought it was a little scruffy around the edges. I've posted two pictures to illustrate this. It may be picky but it's good to show you the pictures they don't show you on the hotel site! The overall hotel wasn't terrible just a little old. Stay here by all means if you like to save money for other things as i do. I did like their lobby and there quirky old lift . The kitchen was good and the room had free wireless. But somebody should hire a new maintenance guy.
45,2088,"Jul 10 2008 	carpark from hell	I didn't hate the Mayflower but there was definately room for improvement. The location is fine, close to Union Square. The price is reasonable but then again the property is very old and it's not sensational value for money, just ok. The staff were all very friendly. Check in was slow but the bill was correct after the car-park charge was added so all went well there. The lobby was homely but i never received any information about the surrounding area or that 'introductory talk' you usually get, however brief. Having returned home i now have come to realise that there was a free breakfast included. I was never told my room included this. Unlike in the British Isles the breakfast is very 'continental' in US hotels. All you get is a bun and a cup of tea so it would hardly have killed them to included the breakfast for us. I thought this was a bit stingy or if it was an oversight it was a very bad one.The room was a bit troublesome. We had a good sized walk in closet and a very useful kitchette which was basic but clean. The room was a good size especially as we only had one double bed in it. Oh yes the bed. Are you extremely skinny? Grand you should be ok fitting two people in it so! It was the tiniest 'queen' i ever did see. Maybe it came from the Victorian Days when everybody was teeny. Two average people would have trouble fitting in it. No real problem, just ask for twin beds or a King. The curtains were the usual rubbish. No problem for me with sunshine however , as I was down a laneway and had a view into somebody else window of another building across . I asked for the quiet side so thats why i got that room so i didn't mind. Free wireless was a good feature if you bring your laptop. Hotels in Vegas wanted to charge this as extra so fair play to the Mayflower, they have it completely free for unlimited time. In fact the cheaper the hotels the more generous they were with wireless.The hotel is old. Very old. The lift is old. The carpark is older. It cannot accommodate big american tanks. They ask you 'is your car big'. Unfortunately our hire car company gave us a big 4x4 that we managed to scratch on the walls of this carpark even though the guy working there tried to help direct us out. And were not talking wing mirrors, were talking the body of the car, thats how tight it is. The wing mirrors have to be folded in.The driver is experienced and had been driving the car for a week. Now seriously i cannot reccommmend anybody with a car book this hotel. It is RIDICULOUS. They need to come up with an alternative place to park the cars or else park it somewhere else yourself and dont avail of the hotel car-park. Its 20dollars? i think anyway. Thats my advice. You have been warned..."
46,2088,"Jun 17 2008 	great hotel lovely staff	stayed here for three nights in June with my boyfriend. Thought location was great..few minutes walk from Union Sq. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and modern.. had a huge walk in waldrobe-great to throw your luggage into and not have things everywhere! The room was similar to ant decent hotel room and had a microwave,fridge,cutlery,etc. Great for travellers who cannot afford to eat out constantly.. esp on the expensive West Coast. Good car parking rates availalbe..another rariity in SF. Would highly recommend staying here. Lovely Irish staff also! Hotel also very secure."
47,2088,"Jun 9 2008	Great hotel in San Francisco	Brilliant hotel. Great location, close to Union Square. Free internet and free breakfast - couldn't ask for more. Rooms spacious and well fitted - everything you need. Everyone really helpful and always happy to help. A bargain!"
48,2088,"Jan 10 2008 	Very happy at the Mayflower	My husband and I stayed at the Mayflower for 5 nights, including New Years. We had a wonderful and wouldn't have picked another hotel. A little background: my husband and have lived in big cities including Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco. My husband lived in the Russian Hill area of San Francisco for over 2 years just a few years ago.Now for the review: the hotel was very clean, including our room. When we checked in we were given a tour by the owner's (Nancy) husband. He showed all us all the different rooms, and gave us a choice of what room we wanted. It is a good idea to do this as all the rooms are bit different and you may find one you like more than another. For example, some rooms have newer refrigerators than others, different cabinetry, etc. They are in the (slow) process of remodeling the wet bar in each room and when they are all done they will look great! Currently, most of them are quite old, but still in good condition. We really enjoyed having a mini fridge and microwave in our room and was one of the many reasons we chose the Mayflower.We also picked a room on a higher floor, as the first and second floors are more open to street noise and are also colder. Since we went in the winter, we wanted to be warmer without using the heat (to avoid stuffiness). We kept the window open most of our stay and the noise was negligible. My husband sleeps with earplugs and is an extremely light sleeper and we both slept well. The bathroom fixtures are new, with old and neat bones still in place. The entire hotel is like this really, with the lovely features that old buildings have still in place, but modernized. We found the staff very helpful and friendly for the most part. Some of the night staff were kind of disinterested, but at that point we were heading to bed and really didn't care. The breakfast that some people raved about was just so-so in our opinion. It's great that they offer it, but we weren't impressed. It's a nice continental breakfast, don't expect more than that. We didn't, and weren't disappointed because of it. Previous reviewers were not kidding about the size of the garage. It is so narrow you have to see it to believe it. Our rental ford focus barely fit, and I mean by mere centimeters. We switched cars mid way through our stay and our Toyota Corolla was a better fit, but not by much. The garage has to be opened manually, and if you come and go frequently, it can be a bit annoying to stop and get out of the car, have someone open the garage and drive it down, but it's not that bad. Especially when you consider the price, the narrowness and slight inconvenience are all worth it.Our room's walk in closet had a funky odor, but I didn't find it obnoxious or offensive. I think it's just from being closed and not often used. Just sort of stale smelling. I hung my clothes in it and they didn't absorb any of the odor. The water pressure in our room was fine, we didn't find it weak at all. The linens were clean and very homey. The neighborhood is just fine. We came and went at all hours of the day and night and encountered no issues whatsoever. The hotel is near the area aslo known as the noberloin or tendernob, a blend of one of the sketchiest areas in SF and one of the ritziest. You turn one corner and you're in sketchville, you turn another and you're surrounded by high end restaurants and hotels. But the Mayflower is closer to the Nob than the Loin. The hotel is locked at night to make sure only guests enter. We walked to Union Square, and Nob Hill and I am in not such great shape, and it was not that bad. The previous poster who complained about the distance and hills - puhlease! If you like driving everywhere, go visit a suburb. We walked up two giant hills to get to Nob Hill and survived. It was fun. The area is good. And for the price, I would say the area is great. I think you would be hard pressed to find such a good deal any where else in the city."
49,2088,"Jan 6 2008 	Great budget hotel	I spent five days at the Mayflower. It's really a great option for less than a hundred dollars. The location is great, near Union Square and the room mas very big. Tou have free internet and , if you need you can also have a parking (for US$20). The breakfast is ok. A very good choice, much better ( and cheaper) than the motels at Lombard street."
50,2088,"Dec 3 2007 	Good If on a budget average for everything else.	Here is some background information before I jump on to the review. This past October, I traveled with a friend to San Francisco during the Canadian thanksgiving week-end and what coincided in San Francisco as Fleet week. The Blue Angels flew over the city a few times which was quite neat, although the public transit system downtown was overwhelmed, especially the cable car. Fact was, we learned that after booking our plane tickets and we were left hanging to find a decent hotel at a decent price. We're both university students in our early 20s and I'm pretty well traveled. Usually, I tend to select slightly plusher accomodation (thanks to a good job despite the student status), in the likes of Marriott, Hyatt, etc. Due to rates at 300$+ with limited availability, we booked the Mayflower for a night at 125$ for a &quot;Superior room&quot;, 45$ more than their standard room, but that would apparently afford us a room higher up and with a view. Given how many people mentionned noise problems, we decided to upgrade. Bottom line, I have a good connection and we were lucky to move to the W for the last two nights. I'll break down the review in two sections, positives and negatives.POSITIVE:-True to the reviews here, Nancy, the owner, is a very nice and helpful lady. A younger Spanish speaking woman working that night was also very nice. That can't be said for the rest of the staff we encountered. -Hallway carpets looked brand new and so did he hallways in general. I agree, everything must have been painted quite recently. Room carpets looked maybe a little older but were still very clean.-Old style elevators but remodeled.-Very nice lobby, front desk and charming breakfast room with a very good continental breakfast included in the room rate, comprising breads, cereals, fruits and coffee/tea/juice/milk and finally yoghurt. -Plumbing related bathroom fixtures obviosuly brand new and no hot water problems.-Free WiFi a big plus. -Kitchenette with fridge and microwave helpful for longer stays.-Plenty of toiletries, including soap, shampoo, lotion and mouthwash.NEGATIVE:-The man who checked us in was a little sketchy and caught off guard smoking outside as we were walking in to register. They do not take credit card information at the time of reservation but will require payment at check-in rather than check-out, even when paying by credit card which I found odd. I asked to see the room first. I recommend you do the same. -Some staff members were rude, including the first gentleman who made the reservation for us over the phone. Completely disinterested.-The kitchenette's glassware was quite visibly unclean, the wine glasses in our room all had either lip gloss or fingerprints on them. -We did not think not having Air conditioning was going to be a problem early Oct. in SFO but given our room faced the sun all afternoon, it was stuffy in there. We therefore kept the window open and it was VERY noisy as a result, despite facing the back. The room did not cool down much before around 3 am when a bunch of drunks yelling woke us up.and we decided to close the window. Ceiling fan helped a bit but I get congested when sleeping with that running so shut it off in the middle of the night. -My bedspread and pillowcases had old blood stains on them. -Room cleanliness was so-so with dust clearly visible in corners and our walk-in had a stench which prevented from storing any luggage in there. -Bathroom, other than fixtures, is clean but old and the shower head as a result came right around the level of my forehead. I'm only 5'9. You can imagine my 6'3 friend had a lot of fun washing his hair in the morning. Took forever given the weak pressure. -The alleged view was pretty much non-existent, our room, despite being on the 5th floor, overlooked neighboring buildings that obstructed most of the view. -Mattresses are brand new (according to their tags) but both me and my friend found them uncomfortable due to firmness. This is more subjective though.-I would disagree the location being good or great. The neighborhood was not re-assuring at night. I would not walk there alone and I'm a guy. Not much around and pretty much everything requires a steep walk downhill or uphill, making transit use mandatory. Union Square is a good 10-15 minute walk. Bottom line, the location is O.K. Nothing more.Would I return to the Mayflower? Possibly If nothing else was available. Based on what I experienced, I can understand why people on a budget like it. It's a roof over your head with a breakfast included. I also thought the 45 additional dollars for a higher floor room was a waste of money, given the rooms lower were described on the phone as being virtually identical. The said view was non-existent and the room, just as noisy as that 80$ room probably was. I probably would have felt I got a better bang for my buck with that room type. If looking for a place to sleep that's relatively clean and safely guarded, accessible by public transit to most of SFO's attractions and cheap, the Mayflower will do it. If you're like us and like your comfort and convenience location-wise, they are wiser options."
51,2088,"Nov 19 2007 	Very good deal and very friendly! Going back there!!	The first week, we stayed at The Fairmont but, because of a major convention, we had to leave there and went to The Mayflower. Our room at The Mayflower was half the price of The Fairmont with many extras, including a garage for the car. We had free wireless ($14.95 a day at The Fairmont) and free continental breakfast ($33 for breakfast at The Fairmont). Quaint atmosphere and felt more like &quot;old San Francisco&quot;, but very clean and neat. We will go back for another night before returning to China."
52,2088,"Nov 6 2007 	Great find for budget conscious travellers.	The Mayflower is an excellent find for those on a budget. I paid approx 40.00 a night for my room and it was more than adequate. The room was very big and plenty of storage of space. Shower was powerful and water always hot. Mattress was comfotable and room was very clean. Staff always pleasant and very helpful at check-in. If you are going to pick fault with it then I guess you could say it is in need of renovation. The buffets in the rooms are very old and do look a little tatty. The danger of renovating though is the price increase it would bring. Also the windows are originals, hence the noise from the street, which can become a disturbance. Free internet access is also a big PLUS. Always helpful to have this facility, especially when trying to make travel arrangements with other people you are trying to meet up with. Nice touch. One thing I will say is that the Lillies in reception are far too overpowering and would be nice if they were replaced with something else."
53,2088,"Oct 28 2007 	It had it's ups and downs	We enjoyed our stay overall but when we checked in we had some serious problems with the managers. Because of some miscommunication with the number of people traveling with us, we had too many people in the room. While the woman who was helping us was very helpful, the man who was also was there was unnecessarily rude and almost yelling at us. It is absolutely ridiculous how he was treating us and completely disrespectful. He was the only problem we had with the hotel, the rooms were big and the bathrooms were nice. I would recommend it as a budget hotel that you are using just for sleep. Great location."
54,2088,"Oct 21 2007 	Nice Hotel Good Price Great Staff	Stayed at the Mayflower with another couple. Two rooms between 3 of us. The hotel is situated in a very good location, near to Union Square, with a garage in the next block.The staff, Nancy and Nick, are friendly and extremely helpful. Rooms are clean, with two huge wardrobes, a very comfy bed and overall this &quot;theme&quot; hotel has a very cosy charm. It's not posh, but heck, it's not meant to be.At the prices offered, this is a really, really good deal - with breakfast (albeit simple) thrown in too.HIghly recommended, no complaints whatsoever. Just read the other reviews. This hotel is ranked in the top 50 out of 240 hotels in SFO, including the high end pricier posher ones. I guess that affirms my view."
55,2088,"Oct 3 2007 	Good hotel lots of character	This hotel was perfect for what we wanted. It had a central location, it was inexpensive and it had parking. It was very old and they were in the process of remodeling, it had lots of character, which made it fun. Nice beds, clean rooms, we would stay again."
56,2088,"Sep 26 2007 	Perfect!	Myself and my 2 friends stayed at The Mayflower for 3 nights in July and we were most impressed! The staff were all very friendly and when we arrived they gave us a map and told us where we should head to in the city and where the nearest bus/cable stops were - they even gave us a bottle of wine from the nearby Napa Valley to take to our room! The rooms were a good size, the beds were very comfortable and although there wasn't air con there was a large ceiling fan which was more than adequate... our room had a small kitchenette with a fridge and microwave and 2 very large walk in cupboards. Breakfast was basic but more than fine for the rate we paid. Location-wise this hotel is perfect, it is in a safe area and within walking distance to all the attractions in San Francisco. This is an old building but that adds to the charm! The lift in the reception area is particularly dinky! Oh and an added bonus was the computer area with free internet access."
57,2088,"Sep 14 2007 	Exactly what I wanted	I was visiting San Francisco for 3 days, primarily to see my son and go to a game at AT&amp;T Park (the Diamondbacks won! yay!). His studio apartment wouldn't quite work for the two of us but I wanted to stay close. I couldn't get any closer as the Mayflower is literally the building next to his apartment building. This was a cool old building with a very nice lobby and loft/mezzanine. The staff made me feel right at home. This is an historic building that while serviceable was not what I would describe as renovated. It was clean and comfortable, though, and it would be a tragedy if this place was brought to its full potential and turned into a trendy boutique hotel that cost $300 a night. Some might find the street-facing rooms a little noisy. I would/will certainly stay here again."
58,2088,"Sep 3 2007 	Great value 	Chosen on Tripadviser recommendations. Excellent place and very friendly and helpful staff, especially Nancy. Even returned things we had left behind. Difficult to believe that the combination of location and price can be beaten. Great sandwiches next door."
59,2088,"Aug 29 2007 	Better than expected for the price	I didn't get off to a good start here, as my rental Chevy Impala wouldn't fit through their garage doors. But it all picked up after that. The staff was very friendly, my room looked like it had been recently painted -- as did the corridors -- which is good in a building as old as this one. (The elevators are the kind that require you to open the door to get out.) My room had a small kitchenette with a tiny fridge, microwave, a sink, counter space, a couple of plates, a couple of bowls, and a fork. (Not sure what you would put in a bowl that you can eat with a fork.) No A.C., but there was a ceiling fan. That was fine. I got a room on the &quot;quiet&quot; side -- and it was, even though the Mayflower is in the heart of the city, between Union Square and Nob Hill. For those not real familiar with Nob Hill, if you're going to Grace Cathedral, be warned that the 2 blocks between the Mayflower and the Cathedral are about the steepest blocks you'll ever see. The Powell-Hyde cable car, which is good for getting around, is a quick 3 blocks away. The Mayflower offers a complimentary breakfast of sorts, which seems increasingly common in hotels/motels. Muffins, packaged cheese, coffee, bananas, orange juice, milk, cereal....Price for 2 nights was $175 total. Absolutely no complaints, and would stay there again. But I'll rent a smaller car next time."
60,2088,"Aug 2 2007 	Nice Place	The Hotel Mayflower is a great place to stay with children. The room we had offered a full-size bed and a twin trundle. The room was very clean, and the no a.c. didn't bug us because the weather was cool and the ceiling fans did the trick. We loved the multiple closets our room offered, it allowed us to stay tidy and stash stuff during our stay. Parking was handy...plenty big once you get down into the garage, but beware, the driveway is extremely narrow. This place is old, old, old...but we found the hotel gave us some real San Francisco flavor. The location is perfect, close to everything. Staff was attentive and friendly. You can't beat it for the price...especially including a light breakfast each day...NICE!"
61,2088,"Jul 30 2007 	A great friendly hotel	The staff here were really friendly and were very helpful. They told us were to go and where not to go. The rooms are clean and a good size. Our room contained two large cupboards, a microwave and a 'fridge. The property is old and is not your modern day fancy hotel - but this adds to the charm. check out the old fashioned elevators!It is centrally located and within walking distance of most things. The breakfast is a simple buffet and quite basic - but fine.If I were to stay in San Francisco I would definitely stay here again."
62,2088,"Jul 17 2007 	Wonderful staff	We stayed at this hotel this month and were so impressed with the wonderful staff. The Hotel was very nice with decent sized rooms, a huge walk in wardrobe, kitchenette with microwave, fridge and sink, spacious bathroom with beautiful toiletries. The Bed was a double, very comfortable with equally comfortable pillows. The breakfast was very nice and we (4 People) were all very happy with our selection. The rooms was very clean and housekeeping was fast and efficient. We found all of the staff to be excellent and the owners were such lovely people we almost felt that we were friends staying in their home. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. It isn't 5 star if that is what you are looking for but if like us you like something clean, comfortable and affordable then you should give this one a try."
63,2088,"Jul 12 2007 	The worst hotel experience of my life!	My husband and I booked a room at the Hotel Mayflower for the last two nights of our California vacation. We chose the Mayflower because the picture of the lobby looked nice, it was cheap, and we had been splurging on pricier rooms for most of our trip. We checked in and went to check out our room - we we're very disappointed with everything beyond the lobby. It's like an old senior apartment building. It smelled like a nursing home and the bed looked 25 years old - with a dip in the middle of the mattress. Oh well, we'd make due I thought. We went back to the car to get our luggage and when we returned, the front door was locked. I rattled the doorknob, my husband pushed on the other side, I was going to ring the buzzer, but looked in and saw someone coming to the door. He peeked out and said &quot;Did you kick the door? You kicked the door. Find another motel, I don't want you here.&quot; And then he slammed the door. I thought it was a joke at first, or he was a crazy resident, or even that it was a scam to get our money. Turns out he was legitimately kicking us out for allegedly kicking the door. It was insane! Here we had paid for our room, and we're struggling to the door with all our luggage and IT&quot;S LOCKED. Do you think we could perhaps be offered some HELP from the staff for goodness sake. NO, we're locked out and then KICKED OUT !We were dumbfounded and quite angry for being treated so rudely , but agreed we'd never dream of staying there after being treated this way anyways and so we waited for them to refund our credit card and left quietly. We SO wanted to kick the door for real on the way out!This story has a happy ending. We found a MUCH NICER hotel a few blocks away - Hotel Carlton- The staff was kind, the decor was new, everything was clean, even valet parking for only $20 more a night!"
64,2088,"Jul 5 2007	Great Location	Great location to everything in the city, only a few blocks away from the cable car. Free bottle of wine at check-in, cheap parking but a tight fit in the garage. Staff was great at giving directions. Definitely will stay there again if I get back to the city."
65,2088,"Jun 29 2007 	A great hotel.	We found the Hotel Mayflower to be a well run establishment with friendly and helpfull staff. The room rates are very reasonable and well equipped with fridge, air con and en suite bathroom with shower and bath. On arrival all guests get a bottle of wine. There is undergroung parking available for approx 10 cars which was provided to us free of charge. It is a very tight space and SUV's may struggle but no problem for the average saloon car. There is free internet access with three computers available for use by guests. Literatue and advice is freely available in the Hotel. Bush Street is only 10 mins walking from the heart of the city and Trams, Buses and taxi's are even closer. This is a great Hotel on a budget."
66,2088,"Jun 27 2007 	Hotel is a personal choice	I stayed at the Hotel Mayflower in March 2007, after reading all the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor about the hotel. Yes, I totally agree with all the good comments. Staff were friendly and attentive, even with her limited English the housekeeping staff took very good care of me. The location is fantastic, except Bush Street could be a problem if you are a light sleeper. Breakfast was complete (considering the room rate) The hotel is not of five-star class, but with basic necessities and great location. However, I believe hotel is a personal choice for everyone. I like the hotel, but it's not my cup of tea. I'm a regular to San Francisco and the reason for travelling is to socialise and get to know people, but this hotel didn't offer me the chance to do so, as much as the other hotels I've stayed during my previous visits."
67,2088,"Jun 18 2007 	Not Bad But Not Great Either	My wife, son and I stayed at the Mayflower June 11-14. We arrived a few hours early, the clerk let us keep our bags there while we went out exploring. That was a nice gesture. When we arrived at our room, however, we were put in a one bed room, when we clearly booked a 2 bed room months ago. That caused some tepidation. But the manager was called and made it right, giving us the first night free. I can understand why guests do not like being on the Bush Street side of the hotel. That street is very loud and alot of traffic. The room we stayed in had no air conditioning and in the 80 degree weather we experienced, we were very warm all night. Thank God for the ceiling fan Many reviewers mentioned the friendly staff. We did not experience this. The clerks went about their business, but were never friendly, and a couple clerks kind of glowered at us when we would first enter the lobby. Two asked us what our business was in the lobby, and we had to tell them we were guests in their hotel. I didn't care for their tone. The breakfast was meager. It looked like they went next door and bought bread and peanut butter and instant oatmeal. It was very plain and no imagination at all. One day after returning back to our room after a day in the 90 degree weather, the housekeeper had turned our ceiling fan off. The room never did cool down. Also, the cable was very basic, and a few channels were always very fuzzy. But you get what you pay for. We never felt unsafe, and we did get to keep our bags at the hotel when we first arrived. Plus, we were reembursed for the first day miscommunication, which was a plus. Would I come back again? Only if I couldn't get a hotel closer to the Wharf."
68,2088,May 7 2007	Great value for the price!	This hotel is so cute and has an old world charm. It's been renovated to its original architecture. You cannot beat the price and the hospitality. I only paid $80 for a one bedroom w/ two double beds and a kitchenette. It's not far to walk from Bart and the neighborhood is totally safe. It was very clean as well. I highly recommend it and would definitely come back!
69,2088,"May 2 2007 	What a Fantastic Find!	My husband wanted to take a &quot;low-budget&quot; weekend trip to San Francisco for our first anniversary &amp; being the &quot;Deal-finder&quot; I am, I tracked down the Mayflower. For only $80 I was a little scared of where we'd end up. What a fantastic surprise! Some of the highlights:- Wonderful staff, very friendly &amp; helpful- Great location... walking distance to Union Square- Safe, clean neighborhood- Free high-speed Internet access in room- Continental breakfast (toast, muffins, oatmeal, juice, coffee, etc.)- Free basic cable- On-site parking (if you have a small car) usually cheaper than public garages- Spacious, clean rooms (with a kitchenette)- Refrigerator, microwave and nice bath ammenities- We got a complimentary bottle of a great red wine when we checked in- Extremely safe... the doors were locked at night and we had to be buzzed in (with ID)The hotel is very charming and historic, but still very clean. My very &quot;anti-city&quot; husband felt safe &amp; comfortable both in the hotel and the surrounding area. The rooms are not luxurious or fancy, but If you are looking for a great deal on a fantastic, authentic SF hotel- this place can't be beat. We'll definitely go back!"
70,2088,"Apr 27 2007 	Worth more than you pay for!	i stayed here a couple of weeks ago. nice clean hotel with great helpful staff! before you book your room though, make sure your heater/aircon is working in the room. the room i booked had a really weak heater and it was very cold in the morning. thank god the beddings were warm. also, ask for a room away from the main street. at 430am, you can hear the street cleaners trucks which really woke me up. otherwise, if you're on a budget but don't want to stay in a hostel, i highly recommend this place. i would stay here again."
71,2088,"Apr 26 2007 	Great price great location	Chose this hotel based on reviews and the price. $80 for a quiet room with a double bed, TV with basic channels, small kitchenette w/ fridge, microwave, and dishes, and a huge closet. It also included a basic continental breakfast with coffee, tea, oj, oatmeal, bread, fruits, baked goods. Front desk was helpful, we were able to check-in at an earlier time, and when we checked out, we were able to store our luggage for a few extra hours. There was wi-fi access, as well computers which helped us plan our trip around SF.Location was great!!! Quite close to the cable cars and MUNI stops. Be careful if you don't know your way around, did manage to wander into Tenderloin area while exploring on our first day. Did feel safe, doors are locked after a certain time, and we just buzz in to get back into the hotel after a long night out :)"
72,2088,"Apr 19 2007 	a great deal for the price	I stayed at the Mayflower after reading the good reviews on Trip Advisor and getting a great rate for the week. The room was only $80 per night, which is very low for San Francisco. For that price, we had a relatively nice and clean room on the 5th floor of the hotel. Our room faced onto Bush Street which can be noisy in the morning, so request a room on the other side of the building if that that may be an issue you. The location of the hotel is fantastic. If you don't mind climbing a steep hill, the California Street cable car line is only two blocks away, providing easy access to the financial district and the Ferry Building. It is also only two or three blocks from the Powell street line, which goes to Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf. Union Square is within easy walking distance as are many restaurants and cafes. The Mayflower is next door to a small market and deli, which was extra convenient since my room had a small kitchenette with a refrigerator. If you don't wake up in time for the continental breakfast (coffee, juice and toast) it is nice to have access to your own refrigerator. Another bonus is that the hotel has its own parking garage. Many hotels in the city charge guests up to $35 per day, but the Mayflower only charged me $10 even though they quoted $20. This included in/out privileges, but you must ask the front desk attendant to open the garage for you as the door is not automatic. The only warning is that the garage is very small. Not only are the spaces small, but the entrance to it is very small as well. Definitely don't plan on parking here if you have an SUV, or even anything larger than our Civic. Overall, the Mayflower is a great hotel. If you don't expect a 5-star room, you will be pleased with the free wireless access and cute details of a quirky old building. Definitely, the price is good for such a great location."
73,2088,Apr 1 2007 	Old yet familiar	This was a wonderful choice it was very resonable and the access to the area is just great. Being on top of one of the hills in San Francisco gives you a great view from Bush St down to the Financial District. Plus it is a short walk to Grant which is where China Town is. The proximity to Tenderloin was a concern until I realized that it was far enough up that the undesirable elements wouldn't go so far as to get this location. The Staff is wonderful they let me in every night since I stayed out and they were very helpful. I was able to even check in at 12 Pm. There is art in all the hallways in this beautifully decorated hotel. The street noise can be a bit much. I did speak the manager about this and she said that the city would not let her change them to double pained windows because it was historic. After all that walking getting to sleep isn't much of a problem.

2,2096,"Nov 16 2009 	Great hotel - highly recommended!	The excellent staff and comfortable stay at Hotel Triton were highlights of our trip to San Francisco. Every one of the staff we encountered was incredibly friendly and willing to help out in any way possible.The room we stayed in (an Eco Premier King Room) was nicely furnished with plenty of room and was very quiet. Some of the fittings (mainly in the bathroom) were a little bit dated but everything was very clean and in good condition. There's free wi-fi throughout the hotel and a free (pretty basic) fitness room in the basement. The free daily wine reception is a great opportunity to sit around and have a chat to the staff and other guests.The location of Hotel Triton is good in that it's within easy walking distance of Chinatown and Union Square. Muni Metro, BART, the F-line streetcar and Powell cable car line are all within a five minute walk so it's easy to get anywhere in the city and to/from the airport via BART.We'll definitely be heading back to Hotel Triton on our next visit to SF - it's great value and I honestly can't think of one bad thing to say about our experience there!"
3,2096,"Nov 11 2009 	What a find!	A group of friends and I went to San Francisco to celebrate my birthday and I chose to stay at Triton because of it's funky look and the Kimpton brand. Although I knew I'd have a great stay, I was still blown away by the amazing service, great location and unique and funky atmosphere. Every staff member I encountered was friendly and accommodating. The location couldn't have been better, we were steps away from great restaurants, shops and China Town. They made a fuss over my birthday and even gave me a birthday gift! The rooms are a bit small, but this hotel has so much heart that it more than makes up for it. I work in the hospitality industry and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone."
4,2096,"Nov 11 2009 	Quirky little hotel in great location	SummaryGreat little hotel with fun freebies like wine tasting and cookies. Rooms are small with no views but it's location is great and service very friendly and helpful.LocationRight at the China Gate you can walk to North Beach, Exchange Square, even to Mission though it's very close to subway. Valet is $35 a night but its not really any cheaper elsewhere.RoomsSmall and very small windows so bit dark but quirkily decorated and perfectly clean and comfortable. Tiny bathroom, again though clean and fineServiceFriendly and helpfulBar and RestaurantThe cafe next door is the bar and restuarant where we had some great cocktails but didn't eat. However our friends who live in San Fran said its's a great cafe. Breakfast is an odd affair with oj and a muffin delivered to your room in a paper bag but you have to pop downstairs if you want coffee (free in the lobby). Make sure one day though that you pop round the corner for the world famous pancakes!!"
5,2096,"Oct 23 2009 	Great location and really friendly and helpful staff	I love staying at Kimpton Hotels when I travel. I picked this one in San Francisco because I knew it would be in a busy area of town with lots of restaurants. It was a great choice. I went for some great morning runs over the San Francisco hills over to Fisherman's Wharf. I loved being by Chinatown and also being close to the BART station. I booked a ZipCar that was parked a half a block away. The staff helped me find the kind of restaurants I wanted to eat at... in fact, the kindly answered all my questions (how to take the BART, how to get here and there.) The room was small but cute and the hotel feels like an old building brought up-to-date with modern amenities. I love ending each day with a free glass of wine in the lobby."
6,2096,"Oct 6 2009 	Very pet friendly cool decor and free wine happy hour...what more to ask for?? oh right by chinatown	I booked this hotel after finding a great price online in planning for a west coast roadtrip. It had decent reviews and had never statyed there. Traveling with a pet kinda makes it complicated in finding decent hotels that accept dogs (real dogs, above 12 pounds; mine's about 55 lbs). It was in a great location right across from the welcome gate to Chinatown, had a great room rate, accepted pets, so I booked it right away for three nights.Only downfall (although I didn't see it as such since I was on vacation and having been to the city before knowing on street parking is at a premium) was the price for the garage parking provided by the hotel. I believe it was $20 a night. I wanted to spend my time in other pursuits than searching for a parking spot. But my truck was available for me to use or get stuff out that I had forgotten to take out with just a phone call. It was pretty convenient and well worth the cost to eliminate any vehicle parking hassles.The hotel staff was very friendly upon check-in. I brought my dog in and they put her name on the &quot;pets at the hotel&quot; chalkboard on the front desk visible for all. Although, she can't read, i'm sure she was proud to be recognized. And being a nice dog, everybody loved her when she was in the elevator, hallways and front lobby by guests and staff alike.The decor was very upbeat and cheery throughout the hotel.The room was kinda small for two people and a dog, but really on vacation, a room is just a bed to sleep in and any niceties are a plus (just my opinion). BUT the room was very well maintained and clean with all the amenities (flat screen TV). Very comfortable and a nice bed (queen) as well. Decent toiletries soap and shampoo and such that aren't like the cheap scrub your skin off and leave you dry and bleeding soaps at the right off the interstate sketch hotel soap. Very nice to take a shower and use the products provided.All in all, this place is pretty cool, hip and a in a great location. Right by the BEST chinese food you could ever get in the country! Great stay and would definitely stay again."
7,2096,Oct 2 2009 	Great place to stay!	I shopped all over the downtown/ Union Sq. area and really wanted to stay at a Kimpton hotel but was having to stay within the budget of my company. I decided on Hotel Triton and was not disappointed! I checked in late and had not had dinner. I had many snack options from the well stocked mini bar! The room did smell a little musty but it is an older building. It wasn't overwhelming but it was noticeable. But....that will not stop me from staying there again. I just checked out this morning and have already made 3 new reservations for my business trips in the coming weeks. EXCELLENT location and very clean. This is my new &quot;go-to&quot; hotel in San Fran!
8,2096,"Sep 27 2009 	a quirky little room steps from Chinatown and Union Square	Upon walking in the hotel, the staff was extremely pleasant, kind and happy to see me. The lobby is quite spacious for a boutique hotel and every night they have a complimentary wine hour from 5pm to 6pm. The hotel is located just steps away from the Chinatown arches and a few short blocks from Union Square. At night, the neighborhood felt very safe and, during the day, it is a bustling area with many dining options and plenty of shopping. My room, on the 3rd floor, was very small. Everything just fit in the room: the queen bed, the TV, drawers, desk and 2 bed tables. The bathroom was very small and the closet space was pretty average. But, it didn't matter. I just needed a place to sleep and take a shower so I wasn't looking for anything fancy. Everything was very clean and I slept soundly in the very comfortable bed. Also, the rate was excellent and I feel like I got my money's worth at this hotel.I have only one complaint.: The ventilation was not very good. I needed to keep the air conditioner on the entire time and it was not particularly humid. It's San Francisco and simply opening the windows provides natural air conditioning. Unfortunately that wasn't an option because the AC unit was located in the only window. Also, one strange thing I noticed was that the fire emergency instructions, located on the inside of the front door, were upside down. Fortunately, there was no fire and I didn't have to stand on my head to read how to safely exit the building!Overall, a nice little hotel but, if you need a lot of space, make sure to check directly with the hotel to make sure you are getting a big room. I think they do have a few larger rooms but most of them are tiny like mine was. Also, try to get a room with a couple windows that open so that you have good ventilation."
9,2096,"Sep 25 2009 	A great hotel for someone travelling alone	I stayed here during July for 5 nights. It was my very first time in the US and since I am coming from Europe I was really worried of what to expect in terms of quality, service and of course safety in my hotel and room since I was travelling on my own.The first impression was the best. Very polite and typical at the same time people in the reception.The room was exactly like the pictures I have seen and they cleaned it every day.The location in San Francisco was perfect, around 5-10 min from everything important downtown.No homeless people around in the evening but of course I didn't return back after 22.00.Totally a good hotel maybe a little expensive for a solo traveler but I always prefer to spend something more and not having to worry about my stuff,my mood etc.If I return to San Fransisco one day I would definetely stay here again."
10,2096,"Sep 12 2009 	Great Location and Staff	The hotel was a pleasant surprise. The &quot;hip&quot; theme scared me a bit, but basically, it was a neat, clean hotel in a wonderful location. The staff was friendly and professional, the room was very clean and comfortable. I particularly appreciated the filtered water. No need to run to Walgreens for bottled water.The only negative I can think of - please, take out all the overpriced items from the fridge. All I want is a small fridge to store a few items. When I return next year, I hope to find and empty fridge. Do that and I would consider this hotel one of my top picks in San Francisco."
11,2096,"Sep 4 2009 	They used window-type air-conditioners!	My travel agent asked me to go for this Triton Hotel because the neighbouring Marriott hotels were found full 2 days before the start of my business trip and I settled for it accordingly, as it was only for one night &quot;transit&quot; stay.The hotel location is convenient and the staff friendly, the common areas and the rooms are slightly worn out but acceptable.The main problem is that the rooms are equipped with &quot;window-type&quot; air-conditioning units which are noisy when operating, and gives no fresh air. [N.B.: Travellers who read this review may trust my judgement as I have been belonging to the property discipline for many years.]After switching on the units at night for 2 hours, the room becomes nothing but noisy and stuffy, lacking oxygen. To open the windows for fresh air means 2 other problems: firstly, my room (and may be half of the rooms in such hotel) faces the side lane where the refuse rooms of the hotel and other adjoining buildings are located and can catch such &quot;unforgettable&quot; smell; secondly, the service vehicles and refuse-collection vehicles in US operate at nights, with their dumping and travelling noises throughout the night-time.So, the result is: &quot;shallow-sleeping people&quot; like me cannot sleep.Fortunately, it was only for one night stay, and I presume I would not be returning again unless they install some centralized ventilation system with treated air.One point worth mentioning: the hotel's web-page didn't show any &quot;window-type&quot; air-conditioning units in any of their rooms' interior photos, and &quot;experienced people&quot; like me would return to the website and find from the exterior night-view photo some ideas of the &quot;window-type&quot; air-conditioning units along the dim facades. I wished I had noticed those &quot;window-type&quot; air-conditioning units before I agreed to my travel agent's former offer."
12,2096,Sep 1 2009 	what a wonderful place to stay	we stayed here for 3 nights and it was just fantastic peaceful and the staff we're so helpful would recommend this place anytime
13,2096,"Aug 13 2009 	Hip funky fabulous	Rooms are small, but location, service and amenities make up for it. Definitely a great off the beaten path hotel. I was in the city for a conference held at the usual generic hotel. Just a walk across Union Square Park."
14,2096,"Aug 2 2009 	Friendly staff great location	We stayed here for two nights and it was a really nice experience. The staff was very friendly and helpfull, the room was nice and the location is super! The complimentary wine hour was also nice and we got to chat to lots of other nice guests."
15,2096,Jul 27 2009 	Trendy hotel rooms a bit underwhelming Nice staff.	Stayed at the Kimpton for a Hematology meeting in late 2008. The Kimpton brand was interesting and it the was our first stay at this hotel. Arrived late Sun night with a large rental car and hungry colleagues. Check in a breeze and chocolate chip cookies calmed the hungry stomaches. Lobby is cute but smallish and the elevators a bit slow. Arriving in the room it was funkily decorated and overlooking the street. A bit of &quot;old guy&quot; smell. that dissappeared with running the AC. he hotel is sort of interesting in that it seems like they took an OLD building and funkied it up. An example is the average light fixture has a painted shade. The bathroom fixtures worked well but were a bit old. The room was a bit dark. Had an ipod dock which was a nice touch. Aveda products which my roomate enjoyed a lot. The hotel staff was nice and they had a slick print server to get some documents I needed printed done. One thing I enjoyed was the &quot;happy hour&quot; where red wine was served and a bunch of us hung out in the lobby. Pretty limited seating though.The location is very good. Next to the Chinatown gates and near some shopping &quot;Ugg&quot; &quot;Banana Republic&quot; etc. It was quiet and safe. Nearby 7 eleven and a reasonably close starbucks. There was a high end breakfast place on the corner that looked good but overpriced. Only a couple of blocks from Union Square and Macy's and Victoria's secret.Overall a decent hotel. Much cheaper than say the Westin but in my opinion you don't get as much. Happy travelling.
16,2096,"Jul 23 2009 	I will stay here whenever I can!	We loved the Triton for its helpful and friendly staff; the cute, clean and quiet room, and the central location. We were able to walk all over The City from there. We hadn't had a vacation in some time and this helped make our trip great."
17,2096,"Jul 21 2009 	Exceptional service	Although the room was not as expected given the photos on the website, I would definitely stay here again purely based on the exceptionally friendly hotel staff. Nothing is too difficult and you really feel like you are staying with some friends rather than at a hotel! The hotel is uniquely decorated, but despite staying in the queen deluxe, the decor in the room was pretty standard. A nice touch is that you can borrow hair straighteners/curlers for free! The wine at 5pm and cookies at 3pm is also special. Perfectly located."
18,2096,"Jul 16 2009 	Funky fun hotel in a fantastic location!	I have wanted to stay at this hotel for years and finally got the chance on a two-night stay with my 11-year-old son in San Francisco on the 11th and 12th of July.Love the decor of this place...it's not your run-of-the-mill hotel! Cartoonish wallpaper, metallic fabrics on the furniture, Michael Jackson videos on the flatscreen, and rubber duckies in the fountain...you know you're in for something different as soon as you pull up.We paid $143 a night with an additional $38 charge per day for parking. I have stayed in nearly every major city in the world and have never paid this much for parking. I did feel that the price of the room was VERY fair compared to other San Francisco hotels of similar quality.Our room (208) was a second floor, corner room directly across from the southernmost Chinatown gate and Starbucks. Great view! My only complaint is that this room, being a corner on a lower floor, was very loud on Saturday night. We were awakened numerous times by very loud, partying people (well after midnight) and traffic. Sunday night was better...we heard no people and turned on the AC unit for some white noise. I didn't ask to move rooms on the second night because I really didn't want to move for just one night - but potential guests should be aware of this if they want to get some sleep.Other than that the stay was outstanding! The room was very comfortable and I was impressed at how this older hotel had been redone to serve modern needs. Great flatscreen for watching movies, comfortable bed, interesting art and decor, and a very nice sink area with lovely amenities. The honor bar is exorbitantly expensive!! I know that all hotels charge crazy amounts for in-room snacks but $3.50 for a Snickers bar and $6 for a bottle of water is just stupid. This hotel is an easy walk from Chinatown (literally right across the street), Union Square, the Financial District, and the Embarcadero/Market Street area. A bus stops right outside the hotel and the Muni is a short walk away.They have a fantastic little French bistro next door that has some of the best croissants I've had outside France. I loved that complete selection of French-language magazines for sale and getting a chance to practice my French with our waiter! Such good coffee - I was a little hesitant to stay here with my son thinking that such a funky hotel would be full of youngish people trying to look hip and pick up on each other...there was some of this but there were also plenty of older people, families, musicians, and regular folk staying. I felt very comfortable staying here with my son!I will certainly stay here again when I come to San Francisco - it's a good value for this city.The staff is great - they always greeted my son and I by name"
19,2096,"Jul 13 2009 	hidden gem	The hotel is in a good location, just few block from Union Square. In the morning you can get Tea or Coffee and at 5pm you can get some wine (white and red).The room size is good for an hotel in the city."
20,2096,Jul 11 2009 	Stay at this hotel!	This hotel could not have been more perfect for a base for our week in San Francisco. The staff were friendly and helpful - they answered queries by email before we arrived and let us check in a few hours early because our room was ready when we were only expecting to drop off our luggage and check in later; the decor is funky; the hotel is clean and well equipped. The best bit? The water feature at the front complete with rubber ducks - genius!
21,2096,"Jun 30 2009 	Nice hotel in a great location	We really enjoyed our stay in the Triton and had booked it after being impressed with the Kimpton hotel we stayed at last year in Washington. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful and the hotel is in a great central location. The rooms werent as small as I was expecting from having read other reviews, and are clean and comfortable, although some additional shelf space in the bathroom would be helpful.We used the fitness room a few times during our stay and this was well equipped, as others have said, the coffee available in reception is a nice addition, however, we didnt get back in time for any of the wine evenings. There is an Irish Pub right behind the hotel (less than 2 minutes walk) that we used a few times where you can get snacks and basic pub food that was quite good"
22,2096,"Jun 26 2009 	Location (by the Chinatown gates) Friendly Staff - Perfect Spot	The location, directly by the Chinatown gates, was just right because it makes the hotel one of the easiest to find in the city. It was a quick walk from the hotel to the 30 bus which you can take to skip the Chinatown mobs and get to other parts of the city. When we arrived on Thursday late afternoon, we checked in with the nicest front desk attendant. He was able to give us a recommendation for Thai food nearby, at OSHA. We took his suggestion and found the place to be just as he described - no frills but great food and fast service. The room we were assigned was just two doors down from the Kathy Griffin suite and because we're both big fans of the D List, we were pretty enchanted every time we walked by the door. I'm a terribly light sleeper but was never awakened by noise because our room was facing the courtyard. It was utterly silent every night - thank you, Hotel Triton. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and small but perfectly sufficient. We also had pretty fast internet connection via the free Kimpton rewards wifi. The coffee service in the mornings was free which is an amenity that is hard to find lately. Moreover, the coffee was tasty and strong and there was soy milk in addition to milk and cream. I would be sold on the coffee service alone. I have absolutely no complaints. This was the perfect hotel for a young couple from the East coast, like my husband and myself. Everyone working in the hotel was beyond helpful: from the cleaning person on our floor, to the valet at the door, to the front desk attendants, to the wine hour host."
23,2096,"Jun 23 2009 	Fun hotel - great location	My husband and I stayed at Triton over Memorial Day weekend. Normally when in San Francisco we stay at my in-laws, but they were having some work done at their place so we got a hotel instead. We decided on a Kimpton Hotel due to the great experiences we have had with them in the past, and Hotel Triton was no exception.We reserved a Queen room and were upgraded to one of their Organic Haven rooms at check in. The room was small but that was to be expected in such a central city location. The closet was a good size and there was a wardrobe for storage as well. The bathroom was small but serviceable, with a nice shower and plenty of shelves for storage of products. We did not have a view (the room looked to the small inside courtyard of the building) but the blinds allowed for plenty of natural light to get in while still giving a lot of privacy. The room also had a source book for all of the organic materials that went into it as well as a guest book signed by previous occupants that was fun to read.The staff was beyond friendly and helpful, and like all Kimpton Hotels there was an evening complementary wine hour from 5 - 6 pm where all guest gathered in the lobby and relaxed on the couches and drank wine. It was a fun way to get to know fellow travelers as well as relax after a hard day sight seeing.This hotel was fun, funky, and comfortable with a great location in the Union Square area right across from the China Town gates. There was a lot to see and do in the area as well as easy access to BART, buses, and cable cars."
24,2096,"Jun 20 2009 	Wonderful location nice hotel	I took a 4-day weekend getaway to San Francisco in April 2009. Doing various web searches for budget-style hotels (I'm typically a budget traveler, even staying in hostels around the world), I found the Hotel Triton to have an incredible sale. For ~$100 / night, I figure I couldn't go wrong considering the truly great location in central S.F.I wasn't wrong. Triton fulfills some major requirements that I look for in hotels: Proximity to public transit to/from airport (only a few blocks walk from Montgomery St. BART Station and even close to cable cars and certainly many bus lines), price, and wireless Internet (it's even free). It's central location is the major bonus for me. The hotel is a small-ish boutique hotel right across the street from the Gates of Chinatown, and within walking distance of North Beach, the Financial District, Tenderloin, etc. It is a bit of a haul on the electric trolley or Muni to the Castro - but I only went to the Castro once or twice. Most of my time was spent sightseeing the central areas of the city, and happy hours in North Beach (Vesuvio is an absolute must).Yes, my room was small and my window looked onto an alley - though I didn't spend much time in my room. I was visiting San Francisco to explore the wonderful city, not the insides of a hotel room. In fact, the staff let me bring a bike that I had rented into my room for safety. The afternoon wine reception was nice (and free), though the wines were, of course, not the best quality (read: free).One complaint - the 2nd day I was there, the maid did not replace my bath towels. I only had one towel out of 2 left. Not the end of the world, but I had rented the bike and needed to shower when I was done with riding for the day (riding up and down those hills can make a guy sweaty), so I had to use my last towel to shower that evening and then use the same one the next morning.All-in-all, as a solo traveler/explorer, I would absolutely stay at the Triton Hotel again, given the price."
25,2096,"Jun 17 2009	Fun 	Adorable! Loved the chic decor and how glamorous -- yet cozy and comforted -- I felt in my luxurious, hotel-supplied animal-print robe following a hot shower and a quick forage through the honor bar (it'd been a trying day!). No, the rooms aren't big but just right for my daughter and I. No view from our room (tiny windows facing the interior), but the funky zebra-striped headboard, a vibrant red wall and whimsical prints upon the walls kept me quite content while indoors. The room was exceptionally clean, the staff accessible and the wine reception a nice touch. (Although, come on, why not do the tarot card readings for a nominal $5? That 'd be more fun.) Best of all, the terrific location invites you to easily visit Chinatown on your right, Union Square to your left, cable car access all around and much more. At the $100 rate I received, I have never stayed at a better San Francisco hotel."
26,2096,"Jun 4 2009 	Understated and fuss-free...a gem	Our exerience at the Triton was unreservedly a good one. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful without being horribly pushy/over-familiar. We took advantage of the free tea and coffee in the morning (which was a real bonus to anyone who finds Starbucks coffee weak and unpleasant) but were always too busy to partake of the evening wine tasting. Our room was on the back of the hotel on a high floor, which meant that we weren't disturbed by noise at all. Sure, it was a wee bit basic-looking, but I wasn't in SF to sit about in a hotel room.The hotel is perfectly situated for some serious shopping (some of it very high-end, if that's your thing) - it's close enough to dump your first haul of the day before going out for round two!Cafe de la Presse next door did a good hearty breakfast, but here's a tip for those of you who can't take a big meal first thing - we would often trot down to the Westfield Centre on Market Street and buy a yogurt from the Bristol Farms store in the basement, and a Peets coffee to accompany it. There's plenty of seating and it's a good place to plan your day ahead. Some more tips: the MUNI pass was fantastic value. Buy yours from the Dick Dale fan in the booth near the cable car turnaround on Market Street.Go to Sausalito on the ferry if you can. What a gorgeous place.The de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park is a cracker and (I would saw) better than SFMOMA.The Triton is definitely worth considering if you are thinking about a trip to The City."
27,2096,"May 28 2009 	Unique hotel in downtown	This was my first time staying at a Kimpton and I had been warned that rooms tended to be small, so I wasn't surprised. It is located in an old building which accounts for the size of the room. We had a queen bed and the room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean with plenty of towels. The staff was very helpful recommending restaurants and reserving a cab to the airport. The location was great. Only a 10 minute walk to the Mascone Convention Center. Our room was quiet with no street noise."
28,2096,"May 4 2009 	Great location but ""shabby chic"" takes on a new meaning here	You can't ask for a better location than the Triton - right across from Chinatown Gate! Too bad you couldn't see it from my room, which looked out into an ugly airwell festooned with pigeon netting. In window air conditioning units blocked the view - not a bad thing - but also meant that the airwell was noisy all night long - like being parked next to an idling truck. The furnishing are hip(ish), but frankly beat to death. The underside of my desk was so beat up that there were splinters of wood hanging down from beneath it. On my desk there was an odd wind chime device that apparently needed (but did not have) batteries to work. The tub was old and gross, and when I ran water into it for a bath, an oily filmy substance rose to the top of the water. No bath for me! The &quot;business center&quot; is one computer in the cramped lobby! I love Kimpton Hotels, but this one is off my list permanently; don't care what the cost of the room may be. Also, the day staff was not very friendly - my check-in concluded with a bored, &quot;Do you NEED me to explain the hotel amenities to you?&quot; This is far, far from the friendly greeting I've received at Kimptons all around the country. Night staff was courteous and helpful."
29,2096,"Apr 30 2009 	Great place.	This was my first time in San Francisco and I couldn't have stayed anywhere better. Great location, two blocks from Union Square, across the street from Chinatown, and a twenty minute walk to the Wharf area. Very safe, spotlessly clean, friendly and helpful staff. My room was one of the Zen Dens, which was fun and colourful and comfortable and quirky, like the rest of the hotel. Loved it- it even has hot tea in the morning free, and complimentary wine in an evening which was a nice touch."
30,2096,"Apr 19 2009 	Clean tiny room with good service and location	The room was small and run-down a bit, but everything was clean. The location is good and the front desk staff were helpful. I got a good price on the room and would definitely recommend if that price was available again."
31,2096,"Apr 14 2009 	Funky Boho-Fun	Stayed here while consulting in San Francisco. Fun, great for a younger crowd. Super convenient location. The rooms were kinda beat up, and the place doesn't have some of the polish of other Union Square hotels, but it is right next to Cafe de la Presse and there is lots of fun people watching."
32,2096,"Apr 11 2009 	Quirky cool hotel	Found this online for our trip to SF. We wanted to stay somewhere that was different before we met up with friends later on in the week. Convenient location to everything downtown, right at the gate to Chinatown We even have had a few friends stay here before, so that helped in our decision.It is a little pricey for what you get in amenities. The wine party is pretty neat to get to mingle with other guests.Staff was very helpful and also good in recommending local restaurants."
33,2096,"Apr 5 2009	A terrific hotel in an ideal location with a fantastic friendly helpful staff	The primary reason I usually choose a Kimpton hotel is because the staff is consistently so nice, so helpful and so willing to accommodate your needs. The Triton staff is no different.I stayed there Mar. 27-28 and paid the extra $10/night for a King room upgrade. I got Room 608 -- overlooking the gates to Chinatown -- and a fabulous view of Coit Tower in the distance.Yes, the room was small - and I had to wear earplugs because the City noise is everywhere (but that's not the hotel's fault).Unlike the Clift Hotel - these young, helpful staff have no attitude - they aren't trying to be hip, cool - just real and helpful.They gave me earplugs, scouted down a WSJ for me, and offered to get me a glass of wine when I knew I would miss their complimentary happy hour. They always said &quot;Hi!&quot; when I entered the lobby - I felt like I belonged there.The location is ideal - walking distance to many SF attractions - and cable car access to the ones you need public transit for.Do yourself a favor - stay at this hotel. It will add immensely to the enjoyment of your SF trip."
34,2096,Mar 28 2009 	Love this place!!	My wife and I came for a little New Years getaway and found this hotel to be wonderful in every aspect. The location was great. The staff was accomodating. You can't go wrong with a stay at the Triton.
35,2096,"Mar 24 2009 	Just what I wanted!	Super comfy beds, amazingly convenient location, nice little touches that keep an old San Francisco hotel from feeling old and commonplace! Very clean, though a bit tired if you are looking really hard, but everything worked and the bedding couldn't have been better. I booked on Expedia 3 hours before arrival and got a great deal; everything was just what I needed. Something fresh and fun, not expensive, but comfortable and convenient. True that the rooms are small, and the bathroom tiny, but cheap rooms are not for people who are spending lots of time in the hotel anyway. This was perfect for a Paddy's Day getaway; convenient to the downtown neighborhoods and a safe, fun environment. Great for the younger crowd."
36,2096,"Mar 20 2009 	Good hotel in a fantastic location	Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Triton and really enjoyed my stay.The staff at the hotel were very friendly and the rooms were perfectly adequate for a short stay. If I was staying longer than 5 days I would probably stay elsewhere as the rooms and bathroom are very small. For a few days this did not really matter.The beds were very comfortable and being on the 7th floor it was fairly quiet. As mentioned already the bathroom was tiny with the sink outside. However, the shower was good and fairly powerful.The hotel offered nice touches such as free coffee in the morning, fresh cookies at 3pm and a nice free wine reception at 5pm. Nice additional touches.Location is perfect. Right next to China Town Gate, just minutes from Union Square and Market Street.I recommend the hotel for a short stay right in the heart of San Francisco. The staff are great and the rooms comfortable.I would stay at the Triton but the rate would have to be right. We only paid 65 per night which offered excellent value for money but I would be reluctant to spend too much more."
37,2096,"Mar 9 2009 	Great location helpful staff and bit quirky	So many times, staying in hotels can mean being stuck in the same old boring formulaic hotels. So the Triton was a really refreshing find!! Located right opposite chinatown gate, and ideally located for shopping and tourist attractions. The brightly cloured lobby was a great place to wait for people, with free coffee in the morning and winetasting from 5-6pm. All the rooms were decorated differently, with artistic touches, and interesting artwork was to be found in corridors. The only downside was the rooms were quite small, but their unique touches certainly made up for it. There was no restaurant in the hotel, but a great cafe for breakfast next door, which also provided room service and was also good for a quiet drink in the evening. The staff were really friendly, and helped us find a number of good places to eat in the evening closeby and were always cheerful. Will definitely be staying there when I return to San Francisco!"
38,2096,Feb 19 2009 	Great location and price!	Upon checkin I got the upgrade for a minimum fee as requested and offered wine (which is the usual 5-6 pm service). :) I like that! I stayed @ a Kimpton Group hotel before and aside from the &quot;Happy Hour&quot; service I also like the free internet use for InTouch members.The location is fantastic! My husband and I were able to go anywhere downtown by foot. The only bad thing was that they did not have any &quot;working&quot; umbrellas! It was soggy and the 2 days we were there the only umbrellas they had did not have a handle to one &quot;smart&quot; guy decided to glue the handle of and of course that did not work!
39,2096,"Jan 25 2009	Best location in San Francisco	We stayed at the Triton for a week over Christmas and had an amazing holiday in San Francisco. The hotel location is perfect. A 5 minute walk to Union Square, Macy's and a 2 minute walk to shops that we loved like H&amp;M, Banana Republic and there's even a Starbucks across the street. The staff are so helpful and can recommend anything. We would definitley recommend doing an open top bus tour if it is your first time in San Francisco. The room was small but very cosy with a great tv that had lots of channels and the shower was very good also. We stayed over Christmas and it was very different to the one we have in Australia but it was still lovely. The gym was very nice too, it was open 24 hours. They also have fresh baked cookies at reception every evening and they are so delicious! The whole family loved the Triton and we can't wait to stay there again!"
40,2096,"Jan 16 2009 	Not good.	This hotel could be cool, and is a cool idea, but was run down. Paint peeling, smelled bad, and small. There are just too many options in San Francisco to use this one.Try something else."
41,2096,"Jan 11 2009 	Another nice stay at the Triton	I've stayed at the Triton off and on for over 10 years. Always had a nice, comfortable stay. Location is outstanding, right at the gate to Chinatown, close to Union Square and Bart stops. Rooms are small but comfortable with nice bathrooms. Lobby is funky but staff is very helpful. And Cafe de la Presse next door has a very nice breakfast menu. Enjoyed the complimentary wine/beer and cookies. All at a nice price. This is an excellent value."
42,2096,"Nov 12 2008 	My favorite hotel in the world!	I have stayed at the Triton approximately 20 times in the past five years while in the city on business, and each time, I hate leaving the property. The entire staff, from the valet to the manager is cordial, knowledgeable, and accommodating. Its proximity to Union Square and Chinatown are a definite plus. I love the ever changing decor, the rooms are vibrant, cozy and comfortable. If you're lucky enough to get into one of the celebrity-themed suites, you're in for a real treat. The decision to stay here for any length of time is a no-brainer."
43,2096,"Oct 25 2008 	Great value great location tiny room	My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Triton for three nights as part of our trip down the coast of California. We chose this hotel because of its affordability and great location, and we were not disappointed.Our check-in was fast and easy, and the helpful staff gave us maps and directions to some fabulous locations in San Francisco. The lobby was small but cute, and we enjoyed their afternoon wine and cookies. There was also a tarot card reader available but we did not use her services.Our room was tiny, but we expected that for the price and location. The tv was nice, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was small but adequate. Everything was clean and comfortable. We didn't spend much time in our room because there is so much to do in San Francisco, but the time we did spend there was fine.We also loved that there was a Starbucks across the street and the gate to Chinatown at the hotel's doorstep. The location of this hotel absolutely can't be beat. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see, from the piers to Chinatown, to Ghiradelli Square. I would definitely recommend this hotel, as long as you don't plan on spending a lot of time in the room."
44,2096,"Oct 23 2008 	one of the best hotels in the world	I often stay at the Triton hotel in San Francisco when I am on business trips.The location couldn't be better: at Chinatown doorstep, there are many nice restaurants close to it and very good shops.The staff are extremely nice and helpful and the rooms are comfy and funky! Love the decoration.I wish all hotels could be like the Triton.Really looking forward to going back there."
45,2096,"Sep 23 2008 	Fantastic Location	We stayed at the Hotel Triton for 3 nights with our baby and the location was absolutely perfect. Right in the heart of the shopping district, and a short walk to the Muni, GOMA, and all the downtown areas. There is also a great French restaurant and wine bar on either side of the hotel.It's important to note that a &quot;suite&quot; does not have a separate living/bedroom area - it is just one room. I felt that the price for the room was too expensive for just one room (we booked an advance fare on the hotel website and it was in the high $200's - unlike the $50 that some lucky people have paid on Priceline!). The decor of the Wyland celebrity suite was definitely not to our taste, but the room was clean and comfortable.For the location alone I would stay at the Hotel Triton again and book a standard room if I was travelling without my child."
46,2096,"Sep 13 2008	Fab fun hotel - with free cookies!	We got this hotel at the bargainous rate of $50 per night via Priceline and had a lovely stay. It was a really cool, fun hotel. The free cookies in the afternoon and free wine in the evenings were a big plus. We decided to extend our stay and stayed at a few other business hotels afterwards, as the Triton was full. They seemed a bit bland after this one!"
47,2096,Aug 29 2008 	I loved it so much that I'm going again!	I loved staying at the Triton. I requested a quiet room away from the elevator and I got it. The staff were really helpful. The room was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. I loved it so much that I have already sent friends there and I am going to be staying there again on my next trip (next week).The location is great. It felt safe coming 'home' at night. It's walkable distance from lots of really great shops and public transport.
48,2096,"Aug 14 2008	Enjoyed Our Stay	This was my third stay at the Hotel Triton in the last 6 or so years. As such, this review wont be as detailed. In sum, the Triton is a perfect location for exploring the city. Its adjacent to Chinatown, a few short blocks to the square and shopping, and close to all sources of transportation to easily get elsewhere in the city. Rooms are small but comfortable and more than adequate. Beds are fantastic! If noise is an issue, then request an inside room. The view is bland (faces an interior courtyard) but youll never hear a sound from the outside. All in all, staff were very friendly and helpfulwhich has always been the norm for this and other Kimpton properties. I had one interaction, however, that was mind-blowingly rude. I had gone downstairs for the evening wine hour. Staff typically pour the beverages (and, in fact, make a point of doing so to prevent customer abuse of the goodies), so I approached the bar and waited for a staff member. She was chatting with friends nearby and looked at me no fewer than three times and looked away each time. Another staff member had been outside assisting another customer and ran to the bar the moment he saw me. He apologized for her not being at her post. I could care less if she was not at her post when I approached, but her rudeness in blatantly ignoring me was over the top. This behavior was well below the usual standards of Kimpton staff."
49,2096,"Jul 13 2008 	Nice but small	Nice boutique-type hotel across the street from Chinatown entry. Hotel was tastefully decorated . The room was small but adequate for our trip. The parking was $38.00/day! Hotel allows pets. For $80, I preferred staying at the Nob HIll Motor Inn which was more central and had FREE parking!"
50,2096,"Jul 5 2008 	Best night in SFO	Sick of boring hotels and motels, we stayed in a large fancy hotel on Union Square the last time we visited San Francisco and although we enjoyed the ambience, we always wanted to give the unique boutique Hotel Triton a try. This time we did, via Expedia, and it was the best decision!My teenage daughter and I stayed in a small double room on the 7th floor with a view of the street below. We loved the bright, fun, but tasteful decor, zany bed heads and furniture, light fixtures, and exhilarating bathroom with good powerful shower. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the two double beds with their luxurious pillows were the most comfortable hotel beds we've experienced in a hotel. The bathrobes were also a nice touch and although we didn't buy one, we were sorely tempted!We liked being able to open the window to fresh outside air as well as having access to an air conditioner, and appreciated the obviously environmentally-friendly policies (recycling, &quot;green&quot; products, re-using towels if willing, etc.) the hotel follows. They even welcome pets! As we drove through the night and then spent the entire day walking our feet off in the city prior to checking in, the Triton provided just the comfort and fun atmosphere we craved. True bliss!Crazy-bright decor and furniture in the lobby with complimentary wine in the late afternoon and good coffee in the morning, a bustling cafe next door and a Starbucks across the street, the entrance to Chinatown a few steps away, and helpful staff on reception at all hours made our stay most memorable.The hotel also has a good location, within walking distance to many highlights, and close to public transportation. Usually we object to the high cost of valet parking in the city and choose to leave our car in the Union Square underground parking garage and walk to our hotel, but this time we made the right decision, leaving our car with the Hotel Triton valet staff. For only a couple of dollars more (plus tip which they deserved!), our car was whisked away, in an out privileges were available (not available at Union Square at the less expensive 24-hour rate), and they even let us park outside the hotel on the street for a little longer so we could walk to the Museum of Modern Art area where it's really hard to find parking. We really appreciated their concern and assistance.My daughter also loved the Triton rubber ducks floating in the fountain at the entrance. Nice touch! We enjoyed sipping coffee in the lobby in the morning, watching people discovering the ducks with amusement as they walked by. Good photo opportunities!We highly recommend the Hotel Triton, and will stay there again.Tip: The cafe next door has great chocolate croissants, and the main street of Chinatown has endless eating opportunities."
51,2096,"Jun 9 2008	Triton is tops	I already liked Kimpton properties for their small, unique boutique approach to hotels. Every time I step into the room of one the major chains I feel like a little of my soul disappears. Hence, I'll take interesting personality over bland uniformity even if the former means the occasional surprise.A surprise we were handed at the Triton recently when our stay was going dandy until our car was &quot;trapped&quot; by a broken door at the offsite garage the Triton uses for valet. But how the Triton staff did backflips to deal with situation was the real and rare delight. Our vacation didn't miss a beat as they found us cabs (and paid for them), comped meals and the valet charges. I imagine they could charge some of these expenses back to the garage, but even if they had to eat some they, in exchange, got a customer for life.And one willing to write his 1st TripAdvisor review ever. Even without the above incident-turned-delight, our stay at the Triton was terrific. Fun rooms, killer lobby, entertaining staff, nifty SF locale, fair price too. Plus, we love Kimpton's real deal sustainable business practices."
52,2096,"Jun 4 2008 	Fabulous Hotel -Great Location Staff Rooms!	Hotel Triton in San Francisco is one of the Kimpton hotels --and when you stay at one of the Kimpton hotels, it's never a dull experience. The Hotel Triton is lovely! The rooms are all so unique and decorated with flair and style. The wine hour is awesome. The staff is amazing --they're friendly and so helpful. I love this hotel! I would recommend staying here when you're on vacation or business --the location is within walking distance to the Financial District and to Union Square. It's fabulous!"
53,2096,"Jun 2 2008 	Awesome Hotel	This hotel is absolutely wonderful! I loved the different look of the hotel. Its unique look was a nice change because staring at white walls with cheesy paintings, like every other hotel, can get boring. It's in an excellent location and it's just a few blocks from a major MUNI station. The employees were incredibly helpful and super nice. They offer a complimentary wine and beer hour at 5 pm, which is something you don't see at most hotels. The restaurant next door (Cafe de la Presse) does Triton's room service and it's extremely tasty! I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. I'm definitely going to stay at the Triton whenever I travel to San Francisco."
54,2096,"May 27 2008 	Nice but different experience	We spent 4 days at the Triton Hotel and enjoyed our stay very much.The hotel has many unusual features compared to other hotels we have stayed with such as the &quot;wine hour&quot; and the decor.If we had anything to complain about it would have to be the garbage trucks every night at all hours of the night.I am not faulting the hotel as we are sure they have little or no control over this matter.Hotel staff was wonderful.We received help from Tim,Anthony,Melissa and Tommy and they all were very pleasant."
55,2096,"May 21 2008 	Best hotel stay ever!	I named my price from priceline.com and received the Hotel Triton as one of my options. The logo looked vaguely familiar but I decided to go with my gut instinct and book the stay. It turned out to be one of THE BEST hotel stays I've had ever. Not only are the celebrity suites fun and kitchy :), the service from everyone on staff was superb! The concierge desk recommended great restaurants and places to visit, helped me when we were lost in the city, not to mention everyone was extremely personable and friendly. The complimentary delicious cookies and &quot;cocktail hour&quot; each day made each day A LOT brighter as well. The location was a great central location for everything we wanted to do in San Francisco. I won't stay anywhere else when I return to the city."
56,2096,"May 3 2008 	tack o rama	I am writing this from the Hotel. I will come update it if there is need. My husband wanted to try somethong new and quirky for our friends 26th birthday (we usually stay at the mark hopkins) so we chose the Hotel Triton, because we had walked by and knew its in a GREAT location, and its a kimpton and weve stayed at The Hotel Monaco in Seattle many times...So we get two &quot;Celebrity Suites&quot; I think they are $359 per night each. After viewing the rooms online, we request the King Triton suite and the Hagen Daz suite....So we get to the hotel at 11pm or so and check in, it is me my husband and one memmber of the other party. The guy was really nice and told us all about where to eat and drink nearby, and the lobby is cute and they have rubber duckies ion the fountain. So the three of us and the hotel worker go up to our room (the other room comes later) and we get in the King Triton suite (supposedly the BEST room they have) and it REEKS like smoke....and someone had put plastic wrap all over the smoke detector...so he brings us air freshener and opens the windows (which look out on some weird wooden scary platform and other rooms) anywayz the room is BEYOND tacky (i have stayed at an adult theme motel before....and really it was better) there are mirrors everywhere, and a bright red light in the tub room (also tub is small one person jacuzzi like the size youd have in your bathroom at home). Also as we walk down to meet the other person, we start to nitoce more and more how the whole hotel is so obviously a former crack motel that they tried hard to make pretty...sagging floors, peeling wallpaper and paint....dirt in weird spots...weird staircases...So its like 1145 now and our friend has parked in front of the hotel and is getting out....we all walk back in. No employees in sight, finally my husband searches one out, and they check her in...she has the hagen daz suite....we go into check it out...MUCH BETTER ROOM than the kinf tritin suite.....much newer and much more care put in (still some uneven paint etc) has very cute fully stocked (free) freezer....the bed rattles tho every time you move even a bit....definitely a nicer room though....so she realizes the pillows are all down and she needs foam...we take the elevator of hell (it randomly goes to unrequested floors and stops) down to ask for some.....&quot;sorry we gave them all away&quot; were told. And thats where we are so far.....more later...."
57,2096,Apr 12 2008 	Fun 	I love this place - it was so fun - all the rooms were funky and it is a pet friendly place. We got upgraded to a king size bed and the room had a great view. It was very clean and the staff was absolutely great! They were all so helpful. There is a complimentary evening wine and beer social time - we met some great people and watched the fortune teller do her magic. Right next door is an Irish Pub called Irish Bank - it is great! We met some very flavorful local people and had a wonderful time!
58,2096,"Apr 7 2008 	Mixed experience at the Triton	I stayed at the Triton for 4 nights, and there are some really great things about the hotel but also some that make it a bit less than great. First up, if you are staying there, make sure you ask for a quiet room away from the garbage trucks. On my first night I was awakened at 3am by horrendous noise. Garbage collection lasts about 30 minutes, and it was hard to get back to sleep afterwards. When I spoke to the front desk about it, just wondering what the noise had been, they immediately moved me to another room, overlooking Bush St and much quieter (there were no noise problems on any other night I was there). They did concede that the garbage collection noise is a major and ongoing problem in the hotel.The room I was moved to was smaller than the first one, but it was generally fine. It was a 'Zen Den', which is one of the smaller categories of room, and there really is no spare space at all, but that wasn't a huge problem. If you want to do yoga in your room or anything, there's no space! It was so small the bathroom didn't even have a bath tub - something they didn't tell me at check in.Nice touches in the room: an iPod player. Fantastic to be able to hear my own music in the hotel room.Huge flat screen TV - but I didn't ever use it. There had been a picture taken down from the wall, and there were clumps of plaster missing from the wall - but it hadn't been repaired, so it looked pretty crappy!hey also claim to have 'internet access on the TV'. Mine didn't work, and they had no technical support at all - front desk admitted they didn't know how to work it, because 'most guests had their own laptops'. On the whole, staff were very helpful, responding promptly to queries. There's quite a variety of people on the desks, so it's often different people there - makes it a bit anonymous.Overall, the hotel seemed unable to make up its mind whether it was trying for 'rock n roll cool' or 'new age zen hipness'. Loud music pumping outside the front door on the street and in the elevators; bright garish colours, party time with the wine in the lobby at 6pm, versus organic cotton sheets, free tarot readings in the lobby... It was all a bit mixed up in terms of what the Hotel's identity was.But on the whole it's fine: the location is excellent - opposite the Chinatown gate, near Union Square, short walk to all public transport and attractions. And next door is the outstanding Cafe de la Press - I ate dinner there twice, and had breakfast there every day. Really good food, reasonably priced, excellent atmosphere, good for people-watching. Would I stay at the Triton again? Probably not, there are other boutique hotels that I prefer, but many people will find it an exciting and pretty hip place to stay."
59,2096,"Mar 20 2008 	Great stay at the Triton!	After reading several of the reviews here, I was a bit concerned that I may not enjoy my stay at the Hotel Triton. There was no need for concern as long as one is prepared to make the right requests. The staff could not have been more pleasant and accommodating. Nick at the front desk made sure I got a quiet room...the most quiet ones face an inner atrium. No view, but perfectly quiet, otherwise you'd face some busy streets or worse yet, an alley with garbage trucks emptying their loads early mornings. As an Kimpton In-Touch loyalty member, I received some bonus amenities- a bottle of vitamin water and a can of some dried cranberries, banana chips, and nut mixture, even a personalized letter from the desk manager welcoming me, a very nice touch!Gemelli, the bellman, was terrific- he retrieved new card keys when mine didn't work, got ice, explained the new flatscreen tv, etc. He always called me by name and was just overall gracious, as were all the staff I encountered.The room was small, but whimsically decorated. The queen bed was extremely comfortable, bathroom included only a shower which was fine by me. Wine hour from 5-6 was great, nice to chat with other guests, repours generously given by the director of sales for the hotel. Yes, this is a different type of hotel, not the staid business kind, but lots of fun and well-kept."
60,2096,"Feb 12 2008 	Cool trendy great location	The Hotel Triton is a very unique hotel with some cool features that suit people who are tired of the monotonous lodging choices. My wife and I spent a weekend there and really enjoyed our stay. When you walk into the lobby you'll think you're in a trendy night club. Lots of different colors and cool/colorful lighting accented with eclectic furniture. The rooms the same style.....modern and trendy. They are a little small but we didn't mind at all since most our time was spent enjoying San Francisco. The things we liked about the hotel:- The overall style. It's definitely a cool place to stay- Complimentary happy hours. The first night we had a drink in the lobby while a DJ played before dinner. You don't get that at other hotels.- Service was great. - Location Some cons:- The free wireless internet. Yes, its free but very slow. You have to pay for premium service but I think that is the only service that works.- The rooms are on the small side, but like I said that wasn't a big deal for us.Overall, if you're up for something trendy, modern, and exciting the Hotel Triton is right up your alley."
61,2096,"Feb 7 2008 	San Francisco Boutique Hotel	Hotel Triton is somewhere I had been wanting to stay for a while and fortunately, a business trip came up that would cover the cost. Yay!The hotel is on the south edge of China Town on the corner or Bush &amp; Grant. Great location, easy access to taxis and public transport.The lobby is very cool with an eclectic mix of furnishings and color. I was upgraded from I don't know what to a king size bed on the 7th floor on the Bush side of the bldg. My co-worker was in a &quot;daybed&quot; on the 3rd floor on the Grant side. He said there was quite a bit of street noise and had a hard time sleeping through it. My room seemed to workout pretty nicely. No street noise, but I did turn on the fan for some &quot;white noise&quot;. The room was pretty modest in size, but very quaintly decorated. I loved it. The bathroom needs some shelving/wall storage next to the sink. The bathroom is small and counter space is minimal, so shelving would have helped. Towels are great - plentiful and fluffy. The TV is pretty small. Someone in another review mentioned a flat screen TV being a good addition and I agree. The honor bar had some good stuff in it, but high prices as typical for something like that.The business center is a desk next to the check-in counter. Very fast and nice computer though - at $5.99 for 15 minutes of internet time. Doooh....In the morning, there is complimentary coffe/tea in the lobby. No food. Early evenings is a happy hour, but I could never make it back in time to make. Bummer.I love San Francisco and if you wanna taste of the funky side, I suggest this hotel. My teenage daughter would love. I would return again....if I could afford it. ;-)"
62,2096,"Feb 4 2008	A fun favorite	I love the Hotel Triton! The location is perfect for a weekend getaway in S.F. Immeditaly in front of the gates of Chinatown, it's a short walk downt he street to Union Square. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They make great concierges. I;ve stayed in a few rooms here but loved the Jerry Garcia Suite most. Great Tub!Just around the corner Belden Lane is tucked away. A great spot if you want a little French Quarter dining. One of the few outdoor dinner spots in the city.Triton honors the Kimpton happy hour and the guests have wine and visit in the lobby. They often have chair massages avilable and I've seen tarot readers there during happy hour as well. The hotel is pet friendly &amp; there are water dishes near the door.This is a really fun place to stay!"
63,2096,"Jan 26 2008 	Great hotel in an excellent location	I booked at the last minute through Priceline and paid $75 per night (versus their standard rate of $200 per night). The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from Union Square and Market Street and also about the same distance from the Montgomery Street BART station. It was about ten minutes to the Ferry building/Embarcadero and also 10-15 minutes through Chinatown to North Beach and the Italian restaurants.Having booked on Priceline for such a low amount I wasn't expectlng much, but was given an excellent room on the 6th floor. I didn't have any problem with street noise as mentioned in earlier posts. The room was small, with a queen bed and not a lot of room around, but it was more than enough for me. The bathroom was equally cozy, with just a shower although it was well-kept and clean, with Aveda shampoo and lotions too. The sink was in the bathroom; other posts suggest that in some rooms the sink is outside of the bathroom. The room was well-furnished and clean although I think if they replaced the large cathode ray television with an LCD screen it could then be wall-mounted and the hotel could do away with the large television-and-minibar-containing cupboard, which dominates the small room. Other highlights include a zebra-striped bathrobe (the black stripes on mine were purple, presumably as a result of bleaching while washing), an iPod docking station, reliable WiFi, clean, comfortable white bedding and also the wine/beer hour from 5-6pm. This was really nice to take a couple of beers up to the room after spending the day walking around San Francisco.I had breakfast at the adjacent Cafe de la Presse which attempts to recreate the ambiance and service of a Parisian cafe, with prices to match.I think the rack rate charged is too much for this hotel, but if I were to be assigned it again through Priceline or Hotwire then I'd be more than happy."
64,2096,"Jan 17 2008	Shortest stay ever! But liked every minute.	My boyfriend and I live in SF, but due to a scheduling snafu over the holidays (too many parents in town at the same time) we found ourselves in need of a hotel for one night. Priceline, and Hotel Triton to the rescue.We checked in at midnight and out at 8 AM, pretty short for a hotel stay, but I can say that we had a very restful night, and even managed to find free street parking!I have stayed in many Kimpton hotels in SF, and agree with the assessments that the interiors here seem a bit tired, but I am also a bit over that particular aesthetic. That said, the location is fabulous if you are visiting from out of town."
65,2096,"Jan 6 2008 	Rainy 	The weather outside was frightful, but our stay at Hotel Triton was delightful! We were taking a 1 night foray into San Francisco and I checked the hotel's website and the price was reasonable. After they sent me an email if I would like to upgrade for $9, I did it and we ended up with a corner room on the top floor with a view of the entrance to Chinatown! The room was cozy, but clean and comfortable. The employees were helpful and friendly from check in right through advice on which way to bring the car for a fast getaway in a driving rainstrorm!"
66,2096,Jan 3 2008 	What an Awesome Way to Ring in the New Year!!!	I was on here reading the reviews of this hotel because I just returned this morning from a trip there. The hotel was awesome the rooms are BEAUTIFUL! If you like bland cookie cutter hotels go stay at a motel 6. This was my first time to San Francisco and I think I talked as much about the excitement of the sights of the city as I did about this hotel. The front desk was friendly and helpful at all hours of the night (we stayed for New Year's so we came back pretty late). They helped us find an awesome club to ring in the New Year's and even made the reservations online for us. I stayed there with my boyfriend and 6 of his family members. We all had awesome rooms and felt that the staff and hotel were excellent. I can't wait to go back to San Francisco just to stay in this hotel again! When I get the pictures we have of the hotel developed I'll post those too.
67,2096,"Dec 31 2007 	Nice hotel night-time street noise pretty intense	Had a 4th floor corner room (Grant &amp; Bush) with nice views, but the night-time street noise was intense. It wasn't the traffic so much, but people shouting; early-morning trash trucks and sidewalk washing. Granted, it's probably average for that part of town.Hotel staff friendly and helpful. If you shop around, you can probably find less expensive parking than the $43 overnight valet service."
68,2096,"Dec 31 2007 	Hotel Triton Funky (in a good way)	The hotel Triton is located literally next door to China Town. The decor is ultra funky and the people at the desk were not only really helpful, but also friendly. The downside: the rooms are VERY small, and our particular room had a view of an inner courtyard that we could never figure out how to get to. Other rooms had an outside view to the street and Chinatown. The coffee in the morning is good but there is no breakfast or even a snack to go with said coffee. Cookies are served at weird times (we never saw them). At night, the place comes alive during happy hour where wine and champagne are served, compliments of the hotel. A tarot reader or an Astrologer are there and one can sit by the fireplace and watch San Francisco go by. We stayed for four nights and enjoyed it very much. We ran into two well known actors there during our stay (staying separately) and it is dog friendly. If it is good enough for Sean Penn and good enough to bring your canine friends, I have nothing bad to say about this place. Oh, and the products in the bathroom are AVEDA! It is also walking distance to the Bay Bridge and across the street from Starbucks and around the corner from a really cool Irish Pub."
69,2096,"Dec 27 2007 	A sweet suite!	My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Triton on our wedding night; we were married in San Francisco and wanted to stay over in the city before embarking on our honeymoon (we're locals). We'd heard great things about the Triton from friends, and everything we heard was met or surpassed. The Triton was friendly, accommodating, quiet, and wholly unique. The room we had was beautifully furnished in hip, offbeat decor, and we didn't hear any noise from the street below when we went to bed. Furthermore the staff were very friendly when we checked in and checked out, and they left us a sweet letter in our suite congratulating us on our marriage and offered us free drinks. They also carry Aveda bath products, which is a definite plus! That said, this hotel is definitely for the 20-30 something set, I think. It has a younger vibe; they have a DJ playing house music downstairs during their complimentary wine hour in the afternoons. This is not to say that those of other generations will not appreciate the Triton; it is uniquely San Francisco in a lot of ways."
70,2096,"Nov 21 2007 	Loved it!	I read plenty of reviews of this hotel before booking it. Many of the reviews complained about the room size and the noise. I decided to ask for a room away from the elevator, alley, and on a higher floor. My stay was wonderful! The room was very nice and clean, and it was not like a sardine can as others have suggested. The size was just fine for my husband and me, and we enjoyed it. I noticed someone said the bathrooms have showers only, but ours was just a regular room and we had a bath/shower combo. Bathroom was stocked with Aveda products (small, travel sizes of course), and the mini bar had lots to choose from. True, there is no bar or restaurant in the hotel, but right next door is a little cafe where you can get wine, pastries, and other food. Plus there are tons of other places nearby. It is located in Union Square right across from the China Town gate--perfect location! Overall the decor and hotel condition is a little old-seeming, but it was not bad. We stayed just 2 nights, and I have no complaints. I did not need ear plugs, but it's a good idea to bring them &quot;just in case&quot; when staying in a city if you're a light sleeper. The one bad thing is that there was a sign on the inside of our door that mentioned the dangers of lead (can't remember for sure but I believe it was lead) in the building. I think it said something about not having prolonged exposure to it. I wasn't too happy about that, but since we were only there 2 nights I figured it would be o.k.Overall, a great experience."
71,2096,"Oct 29 2007 	Boutique past its best	The Hotel Triton in Grant Avenue downtown San Francisco promises to be a fantastic boutique hotel experience to counter the usual Holiday Inn or Marriott experience. Location-wise it could not be better, located just a block or so from Union Square, though I suspect the nouveau boutique reviews were written a while back. The $ rate was good for the location, though (read on) I guess you get what you pay for.... The unique hotel decor is entertaining but a little tired. It has little in the way of facilities: there's no bar or restaurant, though there are loads in the neighbourhood. I was overcharged for the minibar and the movies and had to have it corrected. My room was small and poorly lit. The free WiFi signal was so bad in the room I had to take my laptop to reception to work - there's no hard-wired broadband in the rooms. My &quot;view&quot; was hugely unattractive and of the side-street garbage bins and local restaurant staff puffing their cigarettes, but I was out all day and most evenings so not the end of the world. 1st night I was woken at 3.10 am by the hotel alarm clock, which to be honest I hadn't checked but was incorrectly set by 6 hours. 2nd night I was woken by next door's restaurants emptying hundreds of glass bottles into the bins one-by-one between 2.00 and 3.00 am. Every night I was woken between 5.00 and 6.00 am by the garbage collection trucks. Lousy experience - I'll never stay there again and don't recommend it, as there are so many better San Francisco hotels these days."
72,2096,"Oct 3 2007 	can't wait to come back!!!	I stayed at the Triton with 3 other girls for a dental convention from September 26-30. Our hotel was booked through the ADA but I picked it out because I thought it looked like fun. From the second we got there to the second we left we were treated like old friends. Remember the old saying, treat others the way you would like to be treated. If you walk into any hotel with an attitude or a chip on your shoulder you're probably going to get the same in return... and ya know what? Ya probably deserve it. Anything we needed they were right on it. They made dinner reservations for us on a few occasions and if we needed anything else they took care of it immediately. I didn't seem to need anything though. There wasn't a thing wrong with the room, the beds were comfortable, and the room was clean. Anyone that complains about the room size is just being a pain in the rear. you think that's small? Go to Europe! If you want a bigger room go stay at a $400 a night hotel! Who cares! I'm not 500 pounds so I had a fine time getting around with my roommate and I don't plan to be in the room but to sleep anyway so that shouldn't even matter. I loved the fresh cookies and wine offered. All free. I also thought the complimentary massages and tarot card readings were cool. It's dog friendly which is nice for those who need it. But I didn't see one trace of any animals the whole time I was there. It's located in a great area, right across the street from China Town. And for those who complain about the noise, get over it! IT'S A CITY PEOPLE!, there is going to be street noise. I slept like a baby. You think thats bad... go to New York!! If you want 100% absolute quite go stay in a bed and breakfast in the mountains of Montana! Gee, some of these other reviews really errked me! At any rate, this is a great hotel, there is a fantastic pub around the corner called the Irish Bank, ask for Mark, tell him Alicia sent ya. I can't wait to go back and I am definatly staying at the Triton! Oh and just a note for you single girls out there..... there is no place on earth better to meet single STRAIGHT men! :)"
73,2096,Sep 15 2007 	Never again.	We love boutique hotels until we stayed at the Triton. The Triton is not a boutique but rather a budget hotel. The room was small (tiny) and the bathroom had no space for our toiletries. The room needed to be refurbished and because of this appeared unkept. We had a view of an alley. We paid $181 a night with taxes. We heard from a friend who lives in San Francisco that the going rate for a room at the Triton isbetween $80-$90 a night and that would be an appropriate price for this property.The hotel advertised Frete sheets and we had one on the bed. They advertised Aveda products and we got one very small bar of soap for two people. I encouraged another couple to stay at the Triton and they left the next day. They found a rather elegant room a few blocks away for the same price. We stayed because we did not want the hassle of moving for a short Labor Day weekend trip. I wrote the hotel with these observations and to date have received no response. I read the Trip Advisor before booking and since the reviews were so mixed i decided to give it a try. Big Mistake on my part.
74,2096,"Sep 13 2007	I enjoyed my stay and the hotel but some of the staff do have an attitude.	I got a really good deal thru priceline ($80 a night) and my request for a quiet room was honored. I was very glad to get a quiet room in this part of SF. This was my first trip to SF and I think this hotel spoke to the uniqueness of the city. I liked the aquatic theme they had going on the lobby. The room worked just fine for me. It looked and smelled clean and I slept well. I can see how some people would find it tacky. I would never decorate my own place with a zebra-striped headboard, but it was fine for a few days in my room. I can also see how more than 1 person in my room could become uncomfortable. I liked the eco-friendly touches in the bathroom (i.e. instead of bottles of shampoo and conditioner, they had a wall-mounted dispenser). I liked the Aveda products they had on the counter too. My favorite part of the hotel was probably the elevator lighting (pink and blue instead of flourescent) which, IMO, made being in the elevator fun and more relaxing.I didn't use valet because I just garaged my car most of the time I was there. I wanted to use public transport and experience the trolley. I found it very easy to find parking in lots nearby a block or two away that were cheaper. Had I wanted to go in and out, though I have no idea if this would've still been cheaper. There places to eat close by (i.e. a Starbucks across the street), so food was easy for me to get.The cons were most of the people who worked there. Where the courtesey they pay you to have in hospitality? Where's your SF pride? Such a great city. You have so much to be proud of! Not the friendliest staff or the most helpful. I think I met one nice person behind the counter. They put cookies out in the afternoon and they'd good.I probably wouldn't return to this hotel unless they have a major customer service overhaul and mainly b/c I didn't prefer the union square/chinatown area. I definitely wouldn't pay full price for it. But it was a unique experience for my first visit and convenient to transportation, union square and Chinatown."
75,2096,Aug 3 2007 	Colorful	The Triton is in a great location right next to the gates of Chinatown. The good-Pet Friendly-Organic coffee and tea available in the lobby every morning-Aveda Toiletries-Soft bathrobes-Great wine reception-soft &amp; wonderful linensThe bad-Room size-Musty smell in some halls-shower only bathrooms-small elevators-smelly gym
76,2096,"Jul 10 2007 	Met Our Expectations	We stayed at the Hotel Triton for one night before heading up the coast. I requested a king room, an early check in and a high floor. The staff met all these requests. We were at the hotel at 11 AM and although check in was not until 3 our room was ready. I thought the rooms were fine. We had a king room. I would agree with past posts that said the rooms were small, ours was small, but it's a city hotel so we expected that. The Triton is an eclectic boutique hotel and the decor is &quot;funky&quot;. Personally, I liked it. Our room was immaculately clean and the bed was very comfortable. I thought the staff was fine. No problems with them at all. A very pleasant surprise was their work out room. Not very big, but good equipment all in top working order. You can't beat the location. It's right across the street from the Chinatown gate and walking distance to Union Square. I would definitely stay there again."
77,2096,"May 8 2007 	Will not stay again	Location: Good - walking distance to Union Square &amp; other restaurants.Staff: Mostly friendly and helpful, but got some attitude on questions about our room.General Feel: Did not like this hotel. Really funky and just not our style. Some people call it &quot;fun&quot; - we called it weird and borderline tacky.Experience: It's a Kimpton property so expected much more than what we got. This was a work related trip w/ spouse and our first night, we were given a double room, right across from the elevator door and it was clear someone had been smoking in the room previously despite their non-smoking policy. The room was also tiny. The remaining nights were were moved to a King room which was still small but a little better for 2 people.The room service option was a French restaurant next door and the menu was very limited in terms of options and types of options. There were some nice perks, free wine/beer in lobby from 5-6pm, coffee in the AM, cookies in the afternoon. But none of those things made the room experience any better and we were there for 4 days."
78,2096,"May 5 2007 	Great Hotel -- Pet Friendly -- Fab Location	We just returned (24 hours ago) from a one week stay in SF at the Triton. Having stayed previously at the Monaco (another great Kimpton hotel) and having read previous reviews here on Tripadvisor we weren't expecting too much. We were pleasantly surprised: the staff are young, friendly and knowledgeable. Our room, though not of course a suite, was comfortable for us (both in our early sixties) and our little dog. You can't beat the location right at the foot of the Chinatown Gate and five minutes from Union Sq. I suggest that if you take your dog, walk him/her around the corner on Bush Avenue to St. Mary's Park; it is a lovely, safe park. I'm happy to say SF is very pet friendly. BTW don't put your pet's excrement in the trash barrels. Many people, unfortunately, scour the trash cans for food.Our room faced Grant and Bush Avenues and was quiet. Request Room 209! Our bathroom was spotless and modern (the new marble and stainless steel wash basin is separate, an alcove, in the main room). No peeling paint, fading fabrics nor foul carpeting. Very comfy king sized bed, comforter and freshly starched linens. Try the Cafe de la Presse downstairs. And the cookies.We would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat.My suggestion to future guests: be specific as to your needs and preferences. Do you have vertigo? Vacation in Dayton. Don't want excessive noise? Request that you not be placed in a room overlooking the alley. Don't like dogs? (and one guy in the hallway totally freaked when he saw our 5 lb. dog on a leash in the hallway) well, don't stay in a hotel that allows pets. Do you like inexpensive, creative homestyle Japanese/Chinese/Vietnamese food? Chinatown is two minutes away. Also go up the stairs from the Hotel lobby to the mezzanine gallery and check out the art works by emerging young artists. Hell yeah -- I left my heart in San Francisco.Enjoy!"
79,2096,"Apr 23 2007	Small and Lousy	I got this hotel on Priceline. Now I understand why they have to sell rooms at such a discount.Despite being a Kimpton (I've stayed at the Palomar and the Monaco before and loved them), this was one of the worst hotels I've ever visited. The rooms are impossibly small, so small that Stuart Little might find the room cramped. Dominating the rooms is an enormous armoire (apparently, the letters &quot;L-C-D&quot; have not reached the ears of the management). These rooms are not &quot;cool-small&quot; like a New York hotel, either. They're just small. If one is lucky, one might get a tiny window with 6 feet of clear view to another window. My room had a view of netting used to keep pidgeons away, although there were several pidgeons roosting there. I felt like The Birdman of Alcatraz. This hotel was disappointing in every way one measures a hotel."
80,2096,"Apr 9 2007 	Smaller rooms good service great location	We had a small problem with our reservation but it was resolved quickly and professionally. The rooms are small, but it's an older hotel and the rates are generally very good for the area. The free wi-fi could use an upgrade, but it worked when it needed to. We'll be staying there again. While it's not the Ritz, it's not a bad value for the money."
81,2096,"Apr 4 2007 	Pretty good	The Triton is a smart little boutique hotel located right by Chinatown and a few blocks from Union Square. The design is pretty quirky - outlandish furniture and bright paint abound. The 2 lifts are lit in bright blue and pink respectively and are liable to induce headaches as a result. The lift doors are also very narrow, causing trouble when moving luggage.The rooms are tidy and smart but a little small, even by SF standards. The bathroom is especially small, with the sink in our room outside the bathroom as a result.There are some neat touches at the hotel though. Free cookies baked twice daily are delicious, as is the daily wine reception at 5pm - you can sample a few wines and beers at no extra charge. The room also features iPod speakers which are great if you have an iPod. Overall, I would say the hotel is possibly over priced, but you won't have a bad stay there."
82,2096,"Mar 31 2007 	Mixed Feelings	Both my husband and I travel extensively for business and have those weird traveller needs. This stay was business for my husband, but pleasure for me, so this reveiw takes both perspectives into account. We are in our mid-thirties, used to live in SF, and like staying at nice hotels, but not stuffy hotels - so we chose the Triton over the W or the Clift. As previous locals, we would have stayed in another neighborhood if it weren't for the conference (staying downtown can be intense), but since we were here for business for him - it worked out great.Positives:-The Triton hit our criteria of staying where other folks our age stay, not being stuffy, and being within walking location to transit (great bonus for heading out to dinner in other neighborhoods) and the convention at the Moscone Center - perfect.-Our room was between a maid's closet and a stairway, so was very quiet. We were here over a weekend and during the week and I never heard anyone partying or being loud.-FREE Coffee in the morning in the lobby was awesome. When you travel a lot it is a pain to have to shower and run down the street for coffee every morning for a week. It was so nice to bop down to the lobby to get some free organic coffee that tasted pretty good.-Small fridges in the room so you can get yogurt and water, etc. and keep it in the room is a huge plus. Nice to have breakfast for yourself to cut down on the eating out 24/7 (even though it is heavenly SF).-Staff was nice and helpful. One thing though - they forgot our 3:00 am wake-up call and 4:00 am taxi, but it worked out.-Huge bed - I barely knew my husband was there.Negatives:-I took an earlier review into account and asked not to stay along the alleyway (good call), but our room was facing the courtyard and had absolutely no view. I think I would prefer to be along Grant or Bush.-We didn't book for the decor - which online looked obnoxious, and it was, but that's okay. -Our room was small. We looked in some other rooms which seemed a bit bigger, but we decided it being quiet was a trade off for size.-The decor needs to be updated. The room seemed worn. This hotel could really be served well to update itself. I hate it when the bathroom grout is grey/black and all the floorboards are beat up, the wall paper is peeling, etc. Though our housecleaning was great - the room just seemed like it could be cleaner. We stayed in an ECO room and the carpet is the same we have in our house, but it was time to replace it. The little rugs were kind of nasty. If you are walking around SF you really need to take your shoes off in the room, they should have a shoe tray by the door to help emphasize that.Overall, I would stay here again because the positives outweigh the negatives, but I would investigate other places first. We like places that are a little cleaner and a little better updated. If you are used to the Ritz, don't stay here - if you like a funky edge, the smell of cannabis floating through the halls, seeing healthy young American's and European's, and an overall good location for downtown business, then stay here."
83,2096,"Mar 19 2007 	Overpriced tiny room	I have stayed at several Kimpton properties around Union Sqare. In terms of price and value this is, by far, the most disappointing. The decor was over the top and trying way too hard. I had a particularly small room which was the size of a small college dorm room. And the staff wasn't that friendly. There are better Kimpton properties around Union Square that are truly fun and quirky. Go to one of those instead."
84,2096,"Mar 9 2007	If you want to sleep don't stay at the Triton	The Triton is awful - shockingly bad. Having read Time Out's review and some on this site we booked for three nights. Arriving in San Francisco with our young kids and full of high hopes, we stayed for just one night and couldn't get out quick enough.OK, it's in a good location, has a quirky reception and groovy carpets, but that doesn't make a good hotel. It's cramped, dated, tired and ill-equipped. The idea you may bump into Cher or Courtney here is laughable. Perhaps they did once stay here a long, long time ago but I bet they never came back..Pete Doherty would probably like this place.Here's five things we particularly hated about it. 1. Small rooms - the first room we were shown had two small beds (double double) crammed in, leaving no room to even open a suitcase. All the bathrooms we saw were tiny. 2. Grotty decor - we were then moved to the 'Gerry Garcia suite' for an extra $100, which looked like it was last cleaned 15 years ago. Gerry must have been very stoned when he 'designed' this room, as the only 'design' was a poorly painted nicotine brown chequer board effect on the walls. It looked like a crude stage set. Were the floral curtains and (greasy) headboard borrowed from Gerry's mum's house? Gloomy lighting, chipped paint, knackered furniture, worn carpets - it had it all. We accepted because we couldn't face moving again with young kids after a long journey but it was pretty grim. What constitutes a suite? This was one medium size room with a double and sofa bed.3. The noise from the rubbish trucks at 10pm, 3am and 4am, right outside the hotel was deafening and unbearable. It woke us all up, and just as we got back to sleep another one would crash around, reverse lights beeping, crushing glass bottles just below the window. It turns out that the street next to the hotel houses all the bins for the street's shops and bars, but god knows why they needed to empty them so many times during the night. And why the hotel doesn't invest in triple-glazed windows to keep the sound out is beyond me - I can't believe anyone would experience that level of sleep deprivation and stay a second night, let alone come back or recommend to a friend. They knew full well about this but still proceeded to put us in this suite quite happily. 4. The staff - nice and well-meaning but not great on service. We asked for a babysitter, and the guy at the desk spent an hour looking before giving up. Only he didn't bother telling us that he hadn't found one, and when I went back to ask him if he'd found one he said he'd been looking on Google but couldn't find one! At this point it was too late in the evening and we had to take our tired kids out to dinner with us. Maybe they're not used to children, but they're part of the Kimpton Group, so all he had to do was call a sister hotel for their recommendation.Also, our DVD player didn't work and the guy they sent up couldn't fix it and really didnt know what he was doing. And the wireless log-in didn't work, so I had to call the support line. At this point I was getting pretty cheesed off with the place. When we complained about the noise the following morning the manager nodded knowingly Ah, yes, the garbage trucks..beyond our control Im afraid.5. There's no bar, and no restaurant. Yes, there's a bistro next door, but it's hardly the same as being able to pop downstairs for a drink at the bar. The 'wine-tasting' comprised a few bottles of cheap Banrock Station (Australian!) Chardonnay and a couple of bottles of Zinfadel - hardly the introduction to Californian wines I was expecting!After our night of disrupted sleep we stumbled down to reception to make our complaints, and to their credit they reimbursed us the extra $100 wed paid and moved us to the (excellent) Argonaut, a sister hotel and part of the Kimpton Group. This we highly recommend and was great for the kids.The Triton needs some serious investment to bring it up to scratch. If you want a good night's sleep, look elsewhere!"
85,2096,"Feb 22 2007	Nice staff .... but!	I stayed at Hotel Triton for two nights in Feb. I had the same experience as one of the other reviewers. I had a room on the third floor facing the alley, and about 3 am the garbage trucks started arriving and emptying dumpsters. If you stay at Hotel Triton request a room on the other side of the building.They were very nice about agreeing to switch me to another room when I asked. They moved my luggage while I was out. When I returned to my new room I discovered water all over the floor of the bathroom. I called the front desk and they sent someone up to clean it up. A little while later the water was back, so I requested another room change. They found a third room for me that was quiet, although not a king sized bed, but that was ok with me by that time.The third room had a sink that was very slow to drain, but I could live with that for one night.The staff is very nice. They are obviously trying hard to make guests comfortable. The decor is funky and interesting. They have a complimentary wine hour in the afternoon and fresh baked cookies, and even a Tarot card reader in the lobby for entertainment. The room rates are reasonable and the location good. But there are some shortcomings with the facilities that make me unsure whether I would stay there when I visit SF again."
86,2096,Feb 1 2007	loved the Jerry Garcia suite	the place had great ambience and a funky decor. Management was friendly and the location was super-convenient for downtown business meetings.
87,2096,"Dec 9 2006 	Location location!	We stayed at Hotel Triton for 4 nights recently and booked through Hotwire for a competitive rate. I expected to be treated to a small room and so-so service based on various reviews (guidebooks, websites, etc). My brother stayed here and proclaimed the rooms to be tiny. We received a room on the Eco floor (7th floor) facing away from the main streets. The room was small, but not uncomfortable in my or my husband's opinion. The bathroom had been renovated with a granite countertop and tiled showerstall. I found our room to be exceptionally peaceful and quiet, perhaps because we were on the top floor. My only problem with the Eco floor was that the shower gel/shampoo/(thin &amp; runny) conditioner was in a dispenser on the wall, but not filled with Aveda products (the normal amenities in a Kimpton hotel). The hotel remedied that when I requested for them. The hotel was a good value- great location (next to Chinatown, steps from shops, close to the BART/MUNI/cable cars), nice perks such as morning coffe &amp; tea, newspapers, fresh apples, cookies. They willingly credited my Kimpton rewards even though I booked through Hotwire. The only service flaw I encountered was at check out, with the less-than-friendly sole front desk person was involved with her personal telephone conversation. I'd probably stay here again and request the 7th floor and steer clear of the rooms facing the elevators which blare music."
88,2096,"Dec 2 2006	Nice hotel but read on	I've combed San Francisco for hotels in the under -$150/night range, and the Triton is my favorite -- location, cleanliness, friendly and helpful staff, and decor are all above average. In my most recent stay, though, I had a room they call a &quot;Zen den,&quot; facing out on an alley along the hotel's south side. At around 2:00 am, I was awakened by loud clanging metal and hydraulic whooshing sounds. These continued, on and off, for well over an hour. Eventually I looked out of the window and saw an enormous garbage truck pulling out of the alley. As I passed the alley in the morning, I counted eighteen dumpsters! I considered asking for another room, but figured this was likely only a once or twice per week occurrence. But the same thing happened the next night. I got up at 4:00 am and asked for another room, and was accommodated without fuss, and it was quiet. So keep that in mind. (Also, be aware that the &quot;Zen den&quot; rooms are quite small, with a double bed along one wall and very little open floor space. The second one they gave me had a stall shower that required crouching to get under the shower stream.)"
89,2096,"Oct 6 2006 	Liked the Jerry Garcia Suite	A really felt like I was in SF, staying at an eco-friendly hotel with funky decor and Greatful Dead inspired themes. Staff was super friendly and suggested some great eats nearby."
90,2096,"Oct 3 2006 	It's the Staff People	The rooms are well above average, the restrauant excellant, however the Hotel Staff is the best out there.. For a great time, where you don't feel like a stranger, the Triton is AAA+ Close to everthing in San Fran...If you stay you won't be Sorry!"
91,2096,"Sep 30 2006 	Good Value	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The location is great - very central. The hotel is unique and we found it to be good value. I was a bit surprised at how small our room and bathroom were, but it wasn't a problem since we were hardly there. The front desk people were very helpful. We would probably stay there again."
92,2096,"Sep 19 2006 	bad experience	We have stayed at this hotel before and had a mostly good experience, however, on a recent trip our vehicle was damaged by the hotel and/or their valet service. The manager and the valet admitted the damage and accepted responsibility -- that is until we checked out and left. I guess they were just telling us what we wanted to hear. Once we returned home, we received a hostile letter from the valet company refusing to accept responsibility. We tried calling the hotel management to remind them that they had accepted responsibility but they never once returned a phone call or email. It's bad enough that they damaged our car, but it took them forever to bring the car around in the morning causing us to be late for an important meeting with an investor. Why the hotel management would behave this way and mistreat its customers is a mystery to us. Buyer beware!!"
93,2096,"Jun 29 2006 	Cool and different	I stayed here two nights on a business trip after recommendation from a colleague who is a regular at Triton. I thought it was a really cool hotel with different and colourful touches, such as the &quot;red light disco elevator&quot;. The room was small but homey and comfortable. There was a small stereo with CD music. Good bathroom.There was a fortune telling lady in the reception area one of the evenings, a bit odd. She had her own table there for clients. The location is excellent. Very central, right outside of China Town. Will probably stay there again."
94,2096,"Jun 19 2006 	Hotel Triton gets an A+	We booked this room from a reccomendation from a friend that lives and is a tour guide in San Francisco. We loved this hotel! Since I travel for my job and stay in the major hotel chains (Hyatt, Westin, Hilton, etc.) The Triton was a breath of fresh air! In one word - Unique!The Hotel is old but that's what gives it the charm. Our room was very small but the ambiance was incredible. Very clean! The decorating was WAY cool. FREE wireless internet worked perfect for us. The bed was so comfortable after a day and night on the town. Good sheets and a down comfortor. Bathroom was small but the shower excellent with soft towels! The room had a flat screen tv and also a radio that I could plug my iPod into. Refrigerator with mini bar.The front desk staff was most helpful. Gave two wonderful suggestions for fantastic restaurants. Also printed maps for us. They serve wine every evening from 5-6 pm and coffee and tea every morning. Even the elevator is an experience! It is in an excellent location; right at the gates to China Town. Walking distance to Union Square, North Beach, and The Ferry Building. I will stay at The Triton when I return to San Francisco!"
95,2096,"Jun 15 2006	Nice Hotel Good Location	You cant beat this location, right at the Chinatown gate on Grant Ave, five minute walk to Union Square, Market Street, cable car stop, and BART station. I took BART from the airport to Montgomery station and easily walked to the hotel. Even though I knew nothing about SF, I had no difficulty finding the hotel. SFs mostly square-grid street layout makes it easy.All of the staff were unfailingly polite, friendly, and enthusiastic. At check-in, I mentioned that this was my first visit to San Francisco, and the front desk clerk gave me a map brochure, oriented me with the area, and made suggestions for dining and sightseeing options based on my interests.Music plays in the lobby, but it was inaudible in my 2 nd floor room. At the intersection outside my window, the crosswalk has a textured pavement, so there was a rough grinding noise every time a car went by, but the air conditioner on low speed provided enough white noise to mask the traffic noise. The weather was cool and did not require AC, so I ran it on fan-only, to circulate in some outside air.The room was big enough to meet my needs, but it was small. If you require a large room this might not be the best place for you. Yes, the hotel is old (which explains why the rooms are small), but it has been thoroughly renovated and is very clean. My room was immaculately clean, and I am very picky about cleanliness. It has a fire alarm system and sprinklers. Seeing that sprinkler head in my room soothed some of my worries about staying in an old hotel. Wireless internet worked fine in my room. Shower was luxurious. If that was a low-flow showerhead, I would never believe it.I enjoyed the hotels morning coffee, but if you dont like their coffee walk to the Starbucks directly across the street. If you dont like that Starbucks, walk 1 block to find the next one. SF seems to have a Starbucks on almost every corner.I had a minor problem on the bill. I used a few items from the honor bar, and I filled out the tally sheet and turned it in to the front desk the night before I checked out. Unbeknownst to me, the maid had already charged for items used on prior days. This caused duplicate billing for some of the items. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk clerk, she cheerfully resolved the problem, crediting my account for the duplicate charges. She accepted my explanation without question, and showed no hesitancy or suspicion.Overall, I had a very pleasant stay and will probably stay here again on my next visit to SF."
96,2096,"May 19 2006	very convenient comfortable	We liked it a lot. It was cozy and in a great location (across from the Chinatown gate). It was a bit expensive. ($200 after taxes). So I might try to find another hotel if I had more time to plan. (I booked about 6-8 weeks ahead). The music in the lobby is a bit annoying. But other than that it was nice. No pool or anything, but we don't care about those things. Only a few blocks from the BART."
97,2096,"May 14 2006	Good location nice rooms - a bit small	I stayed at the Triton for a week and overall enjoyed the experience. On arrival we were given a double room rather than a twin but we were switched without any complications or trouble the next morning. The rooms are very small but are clean and quirky as with the hotel in general - Prince William speaks on the early call alarm!!The staff was generally very helpful but there was one or two that are rude and totally unhelpful. The free internet access in the lobby is handy. The fortune teller each evening is a waste of money.The location is very good, within minutes of Union Square (which is very quiet at night), the hotel is at the gate of Chinatown and unlike alot of hotels is not on a steep hill (a major bonus).The restaurant was closed (for renovation I think) so I can't comment on it.I would recommend the hotel as long as you don't have a lot of luggage."
98,2096,"May 8 2006	Perfect Location...Fun Hotel	Just returned from a two-night stay at the Triton, and I have to say my experience was in contrast to that of some of the other reviewers who felt there was a lack of restaurants in the neighborhood or that the staff wasn't helpful enough. We received excellent recommendations for dining in the neighborhood (Taylor St., Ryoko and Le Colonial) both nights of our stay from helpful concierge, Nick. Add to that a perfect location -- practically in Chinatown, right next to Union Square, and convenient to the waterfront--and a fun decor. It's true that some facilities could use better upkeep (e.g., plumbing), but for the price, I would go back to Triton again in a heartbeat."
99,2096,May 3 2006 	A nice surprise...	Traveling in San Francisco for a conference and all the big named hotels were sold out when I came acrosss this wonderfully decorative place as an alternative. The location was great...being right across from the gates of China town and the staff were friendly. I was really pleased to see that the hotel was also environmentally friendly. The decor made you feel like you were living it up in San Francisco with a bit of chic sophistication. The rooms were small but I thought the were adequete if you are rooming with someone you know fairly well. The daily fresh baked cookies in the lobby were also an added plus. I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this whimsical little place.
100,2096,"Mar 25 2006	Good location reasonable accomodation	My husband and I were very excited about staying at this hotel at the beginning of our honeymoon as it seemed a bit different from the norm. We stayed in a number of different hotels during our trip and this was our least favourite as it was just a little bit tired.The location of this hotel is good, although we found that there are only a couple of decent restaurants in close proximity to the hotel. The lobby was nice but we started to see tired decor on stepping out of the lift on our floor. There had been a leak outside of one of the rooms and the wallpaper was all peeling off, with plaster and paper lying on the carpet. Our room was not very spacious but big enough. It was in need of some upgrading though in order to make it the trendy boutique hotel it is advertised as. The bed however was very comfortable and the bathroom facilities were fine, if a bit cramped.We found the reception staff helpful, but housekeeping don't give you much warning before bursting in so make sure to use your lock or do not disturb if you want to avoid that!!Overall we thought that you could find a better hotel for the money but this one would do fine for a central location for a few nights."
101,2096,"Jan 24 2006	former Triton fan disappointed	Hotel Triton has been one of my favorite San Francisco hotels  but I was very disappointed during a recent visit. I first discovered the hotel in the mid-90s, and have appreciated its great location, artsy ambience, and stated views on saving the environment. Unfortunately, the quality of the hotel's guest experience has really declined, seemingly in favor of the bottom line.The building is showing its age and maintenance is below average. My shower pipes squealed loudly and bathroom sink drained extremely slowly. I reported both to the front desk, but neither problem was resolved during my stay.Many amenities now need to be requested from the front desk. I requested three amenities, and received just one, even after two requests. More troubling was the surprisingly low quality of service from the concierge and desk staff, who seem young and inexperienced. While a couple of the staff were courteous and interested in helping, a couple more seemed to lack aptitude in guest relations and etiquette. One concierge provided some major mis-information which wasted valuable time on my last day in the city. At check out, there was a problem with the room service portion of my bill, which we were unable to resolve. I emailed the hotel and to date (a week later) have not heard back. A disappointing ending to a disappointing stay.I hope that with more comments like these the Triton will take a good, hard look at its management, staff, training, maintenance, etc., and become a better hotel. Until then, Ill explore other accommodations the next time Im in SF."
102,2096,"Jan 23 2006 	Well located Kimpton outlet	Just beside the Chinatown Gate, the Triton is close to Union Square and Market Street, very well placed for transit and shopping, and a good starting point for walks to the Ferry Terminal and SFMoMA. Not much in the way of good and inexpensive food in the neighborhood, so it was good to clear out early to get to more residential neighborhoods. The hotel was clean, with a pleasant staff, and the room was well-appointed, though in the rather silly contemporary style favored by Kimpton hotels. Noise in our court-facing room was minimal, despite construction going on all over the neighborhood."
103,2096,"Jan 3 2006 	Wouldn't stay at this place if you paid me	I was looking forward to staying at this arty SF hotel for sometime. I had the chance to spend one night here in October 2005. My room was small and looked into a very dreary lightwell. The TV cabinet was so large, it dominated the room. The decor was OK.All would have been forgiven if not for the hallway brawl that awoke me at 5:15 am. After calling the front desk twice, and listening clearly to a brutal fight in the hall and the room across from me I finally decided to call 911. I was afraid to go into the hall, but from the sound of it, I think another guest finally did go into the hall to help. When I finally did venture into the hall there was broken glass and other debris. I thought I would receive at least a simple apology from someone at the desk. All I received was my bill. Even the hallway wasn't promptly cleaned up.I've never had to call 911 at any hotel. Even understanding if an unusual incident would happen, no one said anything, and yet 2 SF patrol cars were needed for this incident. I'm glad this venue is available to tell others about this experience."
104,2096,"Nov 13 2005	Solid Boutique Hotel	The lobby and guest room were nicely decorated, the bathroom was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. But the guest room was very small (standard queen), the work desk was very awkward, and very few of the power outlets worked. I only stayed one night in the Triton, but for the price, I was very satisfied with my stay."
105,2096,"Oct 24 2005	Friendly Hotel in a great Location	We stayed at the Hotel Triton for 4 nights in September. If we ever visited again we would definately stay at the same place.From when we first arrived the hotel staff were exceptionally friendly. Complimentary wine is served from 5-6pm. Unfortunately we arrived just after 6, however the staff at the front desk insisted that they get me a glass of wine after our long journey. A perfect start to the holiday!Yes, the rooms and bathrooms are on the small side, but the hotel makes up for this by just being 'different'. The lifts, decor, lobby etc are all interesting and whether it is to your taste or not, it does make a change to the regular hotel look!The hotel is in a great location, just a couple of minutes walk to Union Sq. Contrary to what other people have said we found the hotel to be quiet.Other good points; free internet access, a nice warming fire in the lobby, afternoon cookies at 3pm, coffee served in the lobby in the morning and good value for money!"
106,2096,"Sep 20 2005	Cafe being renovated	Contrary to other comments below, I liked the hotel. Yes the rooms are small, but who wants to stay in the room in a city like S.F.? They were clean (no smells), practical and had everything you need + style! Service was very friendly and helpful, so the only drawback end of August was that their Cafe was not available during renovation. Ask if it's open again if you like to have breakfast in the hotel. It's worth booking well in advance, because rates did go up when I checked them later. Booking through their website is convenient - and does allow later changes or cancellations, if your plans change."
107,2096,"Sep 20 2005	Hotel Triton! Excellent Location Great Staff	I stayed at the Hotel Trition from September 1st to September 5th and really enjoyed it. The hotel is in a excellent location and walking distance to almost any of the attractions that a tourist may want to see (chinatown, union square, fisherman's wharf etc.) It is also a short walk to the cable car stop located only two blocks from the hotel.My family got a taxi couple of times. The hotel staff was courteous enough to hail a taxi for us. Also, the cafe was closed during our stay but we had easy access to some very nice breakfast places. POSH BAGELS and FRANCISCAN CROSSIANTS were right around the corner and so is Starbucks. There is also Walgreens and 7-eleven right near the hotel. So, it worked perfectly for us.I booked this hotel on priceline for $80 a night. I got two Zenden rooms which only has a single bed. Upon a few conversations with the staff, I was upgraded to a room with two double beds and one with a king bed without any problems. The rooms had a view of chinatown and did not have any noise issues. Upon reading previous reviews of this hotel, I had requested them not to give me a room that faces the alley and my request was met without any hesitation.The hotel staff had already told me that the rooms were about 14 by 11 in size so the size of the rooms was not a surprise to me. I admit that the rooms could be a little more updated. My only complain is that the bathrooms do not have an exhaust. Overall, my stay was very pleasant. The staff was helpful and informative and I would definitely stay here again."
108,2096,"Sep 18 2005	Bad hotel great location	Great location being close to excellent shopping and a good start point for most tourist destinations but we found The Triton very disappointing. The staff were friendly and competent but the rooms were small, badly decorated (we thought ours had been decorated by a four year old!) and overpriced. On the whole we felt the hotel was quite shabby and did not feel any formal design input had been put into the rooms or corridors but a mish-mash of ebay and garage sale junk thrown together with little care for the overall aesthetics. I will say that the reception area furnishings and decor do work better than the corridors and rooms but hope some day soon they will choose to lose the blue and red lights in the lift interiors (!)Cafe de la Presse was closed (as has been since at least my last trip in April) which was a real blow as I've eaten there many times and really enjoyed it. Shame there was a charge for the Tarot readings during the wine event and that the wine I endured was of such poor quality. The whole idea could have been a fun talking point and good opportunity to socialise."
109,2096,"Aug 19 2005	Am I missing something???	Booked this through hotwire at $125 a night. The staff were very friendly, though inexperienced (our first room had other guests luggage in it, the second room we opened to guests being in the room, the third room was fine). This hotel was very dated and shabby, and the room was uncomfortably tiny. Also, the Cafe De Presse was being renovated RIGHT BELOW US so all day from 8 in the morning until 6 at night all we heard was banging and loud construction noise (even on the weekend!). PArking was a rip off at $37 plus tax, and it took nearly 20 minutes for the valet to get our car once we were ready to check out. Would not stay here again at all!!!"
110,2096,"Jul 27 2005 	Too tiny too funky	Wierd funky hotel. Tiny rooms, flashy furniture. Its trying to be funky in a cool way, but definitely not my style. Definitely not a place for business travelers. Location isn't bad - bang in front of China Town gate. If you like blue and red velvet furniture in a cramped up room, then go for it!"
111,2096,"Jul 22 2005 	Great concept decor but noisy weird ick smell	I loved the location and feel of this hotel but the rooms are definitely NOT soundproof, as advertised. All night long big trucks seemed to be noisily lumbering by and it sounded like trash was endlessly being picked up. But this tends to make you get up early and take advantage of the neighborhood. Check out Grace Cathedral and the indoor and outdoor labyrinths. And you can lay out your day geographicallly from there too. Chinatown and all the neighborhoods are also interesting in the early hours.But I digress. I think the real turnoff for me was the odd odor on my floor (4th) and in my room. I had a Zen Den and although it was small, it was perfect for one person and very interesting. But that smell...as I lay awakened in the middle of the night by the all the truck noise I had thoughts of Legionnaire's disease and spores insidiously creeping through my system. It was disconcerting, to say the least.I'll be up in SF on business all fall/winter and may give the Triton another shot. But I'll try other Kimpton's first. My only other experience has been with the Hotel George in DC--just wonderful.If you so end up here, check out Akiko's, right around the corner, for incredible Japanese food. Beautiful presentation and very eclectic /artistic space.SF is incredible...enjoy!"
112,2096,"Jul 7 2005	This place is the real deal. Great Hotel. Great Location.	If you are looking for a place a cut above your basic hotel in San Francisco, but still reasonably priced, this is it. It's located in the heart of Union Square, next to the Chinatown gate, and is within walking distance of almost everything in SF. It's in a very good and safe neighborhood. The rooms are small, but they are surprisingly quiet and well appointed. If you are going to spend a lot of time in your room and want a lot of space, look elsewhere, otherwise this is a gem. So what are the extras that make this place so good? First and foremost, the wine hour. Many of the hotel guests gather in the lobby for the wine tasting hour between 5 and 6pm and it's surprisingly fun, low key and social. There is also a chair masseuse and a tarot card reader hanging out. For whatever reason, I really looked forward to this every day we were there. The second thing that sets this place apart is the staff. Almost everyone we dealt with was very friendly, knowledgeable and really seemed to care about helping us. The third thing was the value. Wireless internet is included free in every room and we were able to book a package that included valet parking for a very reasonable rate. Bottom Line-This boutique hotel is the real deal!"
113,2096,"Jul 1 2005 	quirky but disappointing	I'd heard that the Triton was an amazing experience, not to be missed since my colleagues know I'm fed up with the run-of-the-mill Hilton/Marriott/Sheratons of business travel. But it didn't meet my expectations, certainly not for the rate of $250ish a night. It is cramped and claustrophobic, the room and bathroom fittings aren't great, there was an odd smell in the room, the wireless internet had no coverage in the room, and the decor (whilst immaculate) was very full-on. I'd pay $160 for it, but a bit of hippyish goodwill doesn't make up the remaining $90 a night."
114,2096,"Feb 10 2005	Triton Rocks!	My husband and I stayed at the Triton for a week-end in January 2005. We are fifty something and loved the Triton. It was cheap and very comfortable. The beds were great, the shower was great. The rooms were uniquely, coolly and tastefully decorated. The staff was friendly. The location, at the gates to Chinatown, was excellent. Even the elevators were cool. The hotel has recently been renovated and it shows."
115,2096,"Dec 10 2004 	Zen Den Hell	Due to a convention in town, I was forced to book this hotel for two nights on a business trip. It was a mistake. I booked the so-called &quot;zen den&quot;, which was a tiny room but liveable with a nice bathroom area and brightly colored walls. The main problem was that the room faced Bush Street, which runs one way to the financial district. For most of the night, you're treated to the noise of speeding cars, loud motorcycles, people chatting as they walk past, garbage trucks, and, at 3 a.m., someone wandering around playing the flute. Needless to say, sleeping was difficult, if not impossible, under these circumstances.The hotel offered to swith me to a room on the other side but noted that the garbage trucks operate over on that side. You could hear them pretty well from my side so it must have been unbearable on that side of the building. In any case, if you're traveling on business and require a quiet hotel, avoid this one. If you don't, you risk having your own zen-like experience trying to get through the work day in a sleep-deprived haze."
116,2096,"Nov 22 2004	Overprized	San Francisco is a great city, but this hotel was rather disappointing. The room I was first given was just awful. Tiny, smelly, dark. The second room was slightly better (but also 20 US $) more. Still smelly and incredibly loud - every morning at 4.30 you get to listen to the dumpster car working in the alley and street below. Maybe the insulation was really bad in my room. The people working there were friendly, but by and large astonishingly incompetent and amateurish. The whole place felt very much like a hotel run by college kids for college kids."
117,2096,"Nov 20 2004	What a great lil' find!	I stayed at the Triton from November 11-14, 2004 with my daughter. Made the reservation with a very personable woman at the actual front desk of the Triton. Personally, I much prefer to make reservations with the actual property which I intend to stay, as opposed to the move by hotels recently to have to make reservations thru a central reservation service which is usually not at the property at all.[How I came across the Triton was because of the lock-out that several of the major hotel chains have imposed on their once-striking workers. After booking a suite at The St. Francis, I found out that it was involved in the lock-out. Given that I will not cross a picket line of workers who have been locked-out of their jobs because I agree with the workers, I had to find an alternate hotel which was not involved in it. Fortunately, thru internet research, I came to hear of the Triton.]Upon checking in, the same woman, Andrea, who had assisted me in booking our reservation, was at the front desk. She was quite helpful in describing the accommodations at the hotel as well as the surrounding area. When we arrived, there were fresh, hot cookies at the front desk. The hot cookies appear twice a day.Also, they host a nightly wine tasting in the lobby, along with Tarot card readings. Fun way to interact with some of the others staying there, if you so desire.We then went up in the funky/modern elevator to 'The Graham Nash Suite,' which was delightfully decorated using Mr. Nash's own personal memorabelia from his career with Crosby, Stills, Nash (and sometimes Young!) as well as being one of their eco-friendly rooms. Wonderful idea! There was a bottle of mint infused water on the desk at no charge. Glad I tried it! Pleasant change from the usual bottled waters!The only downside was that the suites that I am accustommed to staying in have two separate rooms...a bedroom and a living room. This suite was one large (compared to the regular sized rooms which we saw while passing the housekeeping staff when they were in cleaning them) room with a couch and chair, etc, along with the bed all in the same room.The Gates of Chinatown are directly across the street, so we had an incredible...and inexpensive...meal of dim sum that evening. We were so pleased with the quality of the ingredients that we ate at various restaurants there throughout our stay. I've never eaten so well for so little in any city before! We never ordered any room service, so can't comment on that aspect.The central location of the hotel was a plus. Union Square is right there one street over. Our trip to San Francisco was to check out different neighborhoods and apartments for my daughter, who is planning on moving there.When the staff heard that we were looking into where best for my daughter to live, they gave us their personal opinions concerning the city's various neighborhoods, etc. That was most helpful, as we were not familiar with the difference in the neighborhoods there.By the end of our stay, my daughter had found a lovely, albeit small, one-bedroom apartment in a secure building with a fabulous view. The room was just fine, the bed very comfy, the decor definitely one-of-a-kind, good shower pressure (an important point for those of us who frequently stay in hotels!), and the staff was the best!I reccommend the Triton for anyone who tires of the usual &quot;same ol' same ol&quot; hotels. The only down side was the lack of a view, as our 'suite' was not facing a street, but rather an alleyway. However, since we were gone most of our stay, it didn't matter much this time. Next time I'll know to ask for a 'suite' view."
118,2096,"Oct 21 2004	Fun and Funky!	I used to live in the Bay Area and was thus tasked with finding a hotel for my business group of four. Not too expensive, good safe location, and representing the quirky, free spirit of San Francisco. Tall order indeed.We stayed at the Hotel Triton for one night and it met all of the criteria with flying colors. Starting with the complimentary wine in the evening, tarot card reader, and fabulous staff who recommended an excellent restaurant and ending with flawless wireless internet service, warm cookies, Aveda products, and a nice quiet room with a delightful ambiance and oh so comfortable bed. The box of animal crackers and personalized note waiting for me were also a nice touchOur wakeup call was Prince William singing Little Red Corvette (you had to be there to appreciate).Definitely staying here again!!"
119,2096,"Oct 20 2004	Not good.	As a former San Franciscan, I chose the Hotel Triton for a funky SF experience for me &amp; my husband who had never been to San Fran.  It looks great from the outside and the lobby. It is right at the entrance to Chinatown, and next to Cafe Presse and my favorite card shop, Advantcard. The decor is really fun, in a funky college student kind of way, and there are some nice touches like candybars in the minibar-like offers in a tray in the room. But: The room was terrible. It was one of the inner rooms facing a rather depressing courtyard deck. (I never saw the outside rooms so I don't know if they are any better but San Fran is usually cloudy so the more light the better I say).  The room was very dark and extremely tiny. The window AC unit blocked a lot of the light coming in the small window.  And the room was very small, so small the bed dominates most of the room. Even with the 2 of us standing with a weekender suitcase each, the room felt very, very crowded. The room (not including the bathroom) was literally the size of 2 office cubicles. I'm really not kidding here. There was absolutely no space to open a suitcase. There was a luggage rack but no place to unfold it, unless you blocked the door to the room or the door to the bathroom. The bathroom was also very tiny and a little worn looking also however they did try to dress it up a bit with some luxury anementies.  But the thing that I didn't like the most about the Hotel Triton is, unfortunently, the service. They just didn't care.  Our room had a connecting door to another room on one side and there was not any insulation between the rooms, these are just standard doors. There were a bunch of guys, and gathering from the conversation, from Iowa for a few days having a bachelor party for a guy named Steve marrying someone named Robin. We could every single word of there conversation through the door and across the courtyard since we shared the corner together. Even heard them break a glass and set another one down on a tabletop. Its not like we were even trying to hear it. We put the AC on, the TV on, and were lying in bed. It was very uncomfortable.  All the other stuff, we thought we could live with but this was a bit much. We went down to request getting moved. And the desk person said that she wouldn't move us and that the Hotel Triton rules doesn't allow parties. We told here there was definately a party. After arguing with us about if this party actually exists, she told us she would tell them to clear out.  We didn't want that, after all the guy was getting married, and again, we just asked to be moved. She called the manager, who said that they couldn't move us, wouldn't tell us why, just something about booking rooms in advance. Very puzzling.  Anyway, we decided to live with it and stayed in the room and spent our San Fran trip avoiding going back to the room until late at night. That's fine, plenty to do in San Fran.One last suprise, on checking out, there were 2 phone calls on our bill! Considering that we both carry cellphones and knowing the cost of hotel phone service we honestly NEVER made one phone call from our room didn't even pick up the phone to call the front desk, just walked on down to the lobby. Weird.  The girl at the counter argued with us about the phone charges! My husband and I kept insisting that we didn't call anyone in San Fran (my friends all live in the East Bay). She said well maybe you called a restaurant. But we didn't make any reservations either. Finally my husband says, we didn't make ANY calls, call the number and see, maybe it was the person before us. She, rather angrily calls the number and nobody answered.  Finally they just take it off our bill. But the whole time the women looked very mad like we were trying to scam her.  When the taxi came to pick us up, my husband says &quot;I tried to be a good sport about this hotel room but that was the last straw. Why would we want to scam her out of $4.00?&quot;  A few other things: The doors used real keys, not electronic cards and don't keep changing the door locks so there is the security issue. The chocolate chip cookie in the lobby were very good. The location in hindsight isn't the great for real tourists, in my opinion. Fisherman's Wharf although garish, is probable the better choice, all the tourist activities seem to begin and end there and because its full od tourist its busier at night time. Our hotel's street was full of homeless people at night.  Anyway, FYI, we are both 33 years old. We heard mixed reviews about the hotel before we went and I can see why.We found it to have a cool glamourized Youth Hotel vibe. Great for college students, I think but NOT great for more mature adults. I would have been ok staying there with a friend for a night but not with my husband. My parents would have hated it, not for the decor but for the cramped quarters and other issues, not worth the price.  I suggest instead, staying at The Argonaut Hotel, which is another boutique hotel, in Fisherman's Wharf. Our friend's stayed there and it looked very nice. It's got a nautical theme, its newly renovated, the rooms are bigger and it seems to be cheerful and cleaner. Hope this helps everyone out there make an informed decision. A hotel can really make or break your trip. Regardless, enjoy your vacation and Have Fun!"
120,2096,"Sep 30 2004	Nice small hotel	A very good hotel at $50 per night (booked via priceline.com). Location is excellent, just 5 minutes walk to Union Square which has Macy's and good shopping area's. Also just by ChinaTown gates and also a cable car ride from Fisherman's Wharf.Staff were very friendly.Rooms a little on the small side, but the bed was very very comfortable, and shower facilities were excellent. Fridge provided.Elevators a little iffy. Also no complementary breakfast provided. Avoid going to the french cafe next door for breakfast as they are very pricey.Massage chairs in the lobby excellent.Overall I'd rate this hotel highly, rooms were clean."
121,2096,"Sep 20 2004	A bit worn	Although it was funky, it was a bit worn and lacked basic creature comforts. The rooms were not as nice as they looked on the hotel's website. We paid 169.00 per night which was a little much for our very small room. Rooms don't have information regarding guest services or telephone books (in fact, not even the front desk had a telephone book). We didn't know there was any room service until we read it on this site. They also gave us faulty printed instructions to the airport, which was frustrating. However, the hotel is ideally situated at the gates of china town. If you can get a rate closer to $99 and don't mind the small rooms, it would be a great deal."
122,2096,"Sep 15 2004	Great location hip design a fun place	Enjoyed our stay here in August 2004. Although rooms are postage-stamp sized, they're nicely decorated and furnished with quality bedding, etc. Original art adds to the ambiance. Elevators are stylishly quirky. Facing the fairly busy Grant Ave., our room was suprisingly quiet. We appreciated the complimentary AM coffee &amp; NY Times and PM wine hour in the lobby with views of the passing scene, not to mention the massage chairs. The adjacent Cafe de la Presse is a cosmoploitan French-style newsstand, cafe and restaurant. The Hotel Triton is a great base for SF business or touring."
123,2096,"Aug 26 2004	Good Value!	We stayed at this hotel in July; we had a great rate ($99) a night. We really thought it was a great deal for the money--- the bed was very comfortable with nice linens, the Aveeda products were fun as were the hotel decorations. Also, you just can't beat the location!!! Also, the little bar next door was great! However, the lobby was worn and the rooms were small so we would not recommend it for honeymooners or folks seeking a 4 Star experience. It was perfect for us and easy on the budget!!!"
124,2096,"Aug 26 2004	Have a name? Get the room #. Heck take the key!	We stayed here last March. The people were nice, but everyone who was working was from another hotel and didn't even know where to buy cigarettes. The rate was good. The room was clean, but way way too small. They allow dogs without a hitch, which is cool. The biggest downside, though, is that they not only gave people my room number without my permission-- but they gave them a key! I came back to my room to find my two friends who I was supposed to meet up with, sitting on my bed. Now, sure-- it was fine this time, but like-- what if they weren't my friends?"
125,2096,"Aug 18 2004	Trendy and Unique	Stayed here last year and had a great time. The location is awesome! Immediate walking distance includes shopping, Chinatown, and several happenin bars and restaurants.The hotel itself is fun and trendy. The decorations give life and character to the hotel. Definitely a change of pace from the usual large chain hotels.The rooms were nice, however a bit small. But that shouldn't really matter since you're spending time in the city, not the room. Oh, and the king size bed *sigh* was very comfortable.The complementary drinks in the afternoon are a nice touch. The serving staff is very friendly and make good conversation.Overall I had a good time and would recommend staying here."
126,2096,"Aug 12 2004	Great location with its share of quirks	We were pleasantly suprised by our stay at the Triton. Yes, the building is old. Yes, the elevators keep you guessing if you will actually make it to your floor. None of that matters if location and cleanliness is important to you. The location of the Triton could not be beat, right at the Chinatown gates, walking distance (a nice long walk) to SBC Park and transportation anywhere else you want to go. Front desk was helpful and attentive. Don't miss the happy hour, the beer and wine are free flowing and its a great chance to meet people that can give you teriffic recommendations on local hot spots. Massaging chairs are fab after a long day of walking. The rooms weren't huge but what rooms are in SF for this price range? Morning teas, coffee and biscotti were a nice touch. The minor complaints: water pressure on the eco floor was horrible. If you have long, thick or curly hair, washing it could be quite a chore. Also, we had bought some fresh cherries at the market and within a day they were swarmed with fruit flies. Hopefully keeping the window closed would solve that last problem!"
127,2096,"Aug 5 2004	A blast and a half	Can't say enuf about this place. All the complainers who say the staff is stuffy can stuff it. We had a large group that felt right at home, and there wasn't one complaint in the bunch. NOT ONE IN FOUR DAYS. Good music, wine and brew during happy hour downstairs, and the lobby -- fughedaboudit -- it's the best there is, possibly the best there ever was. If you can afford the valet service for your car (a tad bit spendy, but hey, it's S.F.) you won't regret it. We had our baby with us and one staff dude got on the floor and handed her a gratis rubber ducky! How cool is that?We'll be back the next time we hit the city. Thanks, Triton. You rock!"
128,2096,"Jul 25 2004	What a Fun Hotel!	A friend and I stayed at the Triton Hotel on 7/23/04. It is a great place to stay if you want a lively boutique hotel with friendly service. The beds were very comfy. Complimentary wine is served from 5pm to 6pm every evening in the lobby where guests gather to talk, get a massage, or have their Tarot cards read! We met people from all over the world. There was also live music. At 3pm and 8pm the hotel serves warm, delicious cookies! The staff were extremely accommodating giving us a later check-out time and happily answering our questions. This hotel is located within a few minutes of Union Square and right at the Gate to China Town and a short walk to North Beach. We also took one of the SF Library free tours and the Java Walk tour with Elaine Sosa, a lively, energetic and fun tour guide who showed us some cool coffee houses in the area ($20) and educated us with some interesting facts about the city."
129,2096,Jul 20 2004	Truly a fun experience	Spending a long weekend here was fantastic. The location was hard to beat as the actual gate of Chinatown was directly across the street! Easy walking distance to much that SF has to offer. The hotel had a free happy hour every evening with free wine and beer and a chance to mingle with other fun travellers. The rooms are small yet well furnished (where else can you find a vibrator in your honor bar). We can't imagine staying somewhere else when we return!
130,2096,"Jun 26 2004	What a fun little hotel!	This place was great - friendly staff, funky decor, immaculate room.We stayed for 2 nights after 2 nights at the Vintage Court. The Triton was a huge improvement over the VC, and less expensive to boot! (okay, only $4/night less, but still!)We had an interior room with a comfortable queen bed. The only bad thing I will say is that the room was TINY. However, for 2 people it was fine - cozy in fact. The interior rooms don't offer anything in the way of a view, but it was extremely quiet. After 2 nights of looking over Bush St at the VC, we were happy to skip the view and get some rest!The wine/beer hour(s) were great fun - the one we attended had a tarot card reader and a complimentary 5 minute massage (or you could pay for more minutes) which was welcomed after walking up those hills all day. There are also two iJoy chairs in the lobby for an anytime revitalization stop!The location was great - right next to the chinatown gate and a quick walk to the cable car. I highly recommend the Triton, and I would stay there again."
131,2096,"Jun 21 2004	Hotel stay...okay	My husband and I had a great time visiting the city, but the hotel was just okay. The room was smaller than we anticipated and dark, a courtyard room is not the way to go. We had a room that had an adjacent wall to the stairwell and a loud couple from upstairs, we could hear everything. It would be nice to have a refrigerator, but it was filled with overly expensive items if used were charged to your room, basically a ripoff. A coke that costs $2.98 for a can...it is safe to say that we did not utilize the fridge...and we could have used it. I ordered a piece of cheesecake and 1 scoop of ice cream from room service ...the cost was $18.95...ridiculous!! I guess it is better to bring along snacks and not to induldge...the price is just too high!!! The staff was nice and helpful planning a wine country tour and the hotel is centrally located. We had a great trip overall, but if we return in the future, we would not stay with this hotel again."
132,2096,"Jun 9 2004	Lots of Character	We (2 adults, 2 kids) stayed at the Hotel Triton in mid-May, in the Weyland suite. The room was good-sized, and we all liked the fish tank (though it was a bit bright during the night). The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive. They let us do late checkout with no problems. The location was ideal for us; we loved being near Chinatown and the cablecars, and not too close to (boring) Union Square. The morning coffee setup had a good selection, and REAL mugs, and the kids loved the evening cookies. We will definitely stay here agin."
133,2096,"Jun 3 2004	Had a blast!	My boyfriend and I recently stayed at this hotel for four nights and we had a wonderful time. Not only is it perfectly situated across the street from China Town, but the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. The rooms were amazing (ask for a corner room with a view). I will go back and stay here in a heartbeat!"
134,2096,"Jun 2 2004	Triton: Great Central Location.	We enjoyed our Memorial Day weekend stay at Hotel Triton! Saturday night we were assigned a TINY room.. with a double bed and a broken air conditioner. However, Sunday night were easily moved to a bigger room with a King bed and a working air conditioner. One other downside, even on a Sunday night, from the 5th floor, we could hear garbage trucks dumping glass bottles very early in the morning. However.. the hotel was centrally located for excursions into Chinatown and Union Square!"
135,2096,"Jun 1 2004	Yes that bad!	I visit San Francisco at least 10 times a year for business and I always stay at the Hotel Palomar which is under the hotel group, Kimpton. The Kimpton Group usually meets my standards when it came to Hotel Palomar or their restuarants. I decided that I would stay with the Hotel Triton because I saw all the great reviews coming from this site and when I checked their website I was impressed with their theme and their style. I was automatically greeted at the door. It was early morning and my eyes were focused on their breakfast set up (coffee, tea). No one was at the frontdesk. I waited for a couple of minutes so I got some coffee first. Once someone got there they were ready to get me out. Alright, I understand that it's fairly early and &quot;we&quot; have yet to wake up, but come on! The lady was too quick and I'm sure she wanted me out of there as fast as possible. I go up on one of their two elevators and go to the room. I had a great room with the most comfortable bed. The room was very simple with a splash of pizazz. I was satisfied with the rooms. Thoe housekeepers were very attentive and helpful with additional ammenities I requested. When I called downstairs for a wake-up call they didn't answer till I called the 3rd time. When I checked out a few days later in the morning I had the same young lady help me. She seemed to continue the same attitude as she did when I checked-in. A lot of blank stares and I felt as if I was pushed out. Throughout the day I the staff was perfect. If I decide to stay there again (not likely) I would come in the afternoon. I enjoyed the cookie!"
136,2096,"Apr 24 2004	Great Time	Stayed at the Triton on April 21st for 2 nights. We had a regular room with 2 double beds and the Jerry Garcia mini suite with a king bed and a pull out sofa. The regular room was small, but the bright colors made it appealling. The suite accommidated 2 adults and 2 children comfortable. The staff was extremely friendly and the wine and beer hour was fun and relaxing. They had a tarot card reader there ($15) and a chair massage available too. Great time had by all."
137,2096,"Apr 13 2004	Fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	The hotel Triton is Fabulous!!! It has a great location, right across from Starbucks and one of the gates to China Town.The staff is helpful and friendly, and the beds are the most comforatable beds in the world. The coffee in the lobby is great. We've also stayed in the Hotel Monaco which is very similar to the Hotel Triton because it's owned by the same company. This was our second stay at the Hotel Triton and we look forward to saying there again."
138,2096,"Apr 1 2004	Fabulous!!	We stayed here during a conference, and I must say, we loved this little hotel. Location great, cocktail hour fabulous, staff really friendly, with great advice on restaurants and driving directions. Funky decor that is not too off the wall, just really neat. Rooms are small but very clean and comfortable. I have to agree with another reviewer about the street noise early in the mornings, but who wants to sleep in while in San Francisco. Too much to see to waste your time in bed. Overall amazing place to stay. We will stay there again!!"
139,2096,"Feb 10 2004	Fun Hotel!	We won a trip to San Francisco and our accomodations were for this hotel. Fun place! Decor colors and styles that I wouldn't think of putting together worked in this hotel. Gave it a fun upbeat atmosphere. Two elevators: one with a black light, and the other with a red light. Loved the red light! Very comfortable bed. Be aware European style means small rooms, but comfortable and decorated pretty wild. The staff was very attentive and helpful! They had a happy hour from 5 - 6 with free wine or beer for guests. The hotel is right across the street from the entrance to China Town. Only 3 blocks away from high end merchants for shopping. We caught the cable cars only 3 blocks away to go to Fisherman's Wharf. Very well located for tourists. We were only there overnight, but we highly recommend this hotel."
140,2096,"Feb 9 2004	The Triton Rocks!	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Triton from January 23-26th and had the best time. We visit San Francisco often and the Triton is by far the best hotel we've ever stayed in.The rooms are on the small side but not at all oppressive or claustrophobic and the decor is really fun. The room we stayed in on the 3rd floor facing the inner courtyard was quiet, very clean and had great amenities.I think the best part about the Triton, however, is the staff. They were so cool, very kind and extremely helpful with directions, recommendations, etc... They also host a wine/beer reception thing in the evenings with a DJ, tarot reader and masseuse that was a really great way to start out the evening.In terms of value, location and service I don't think you can do any better than the Triton!!!"
141,2096,"Jan 16 2004	The most charming hotel	Hotel Triton has all the ingredients for a great boutique hotel. Rennovated old building with charms of the olden days but all the conveniences of the new. Lots of colors and art work from the inviting lobby to the blue tiled bathrooms, at least in our bathroom... Even the receptionist fit the hotel, funky but helpful. And it will be very difficult to find another place at this rate at this great location. We are definitely returning to Hotel Triton"
142,2096,"Oct 29 2003	Good location	When we arrived, discovered our internet booking thru an agent didn't appear in their reservation list. They were good enough to upgrade us from a Queen room to a King room at no extra charge to make up for it. Located just at the entrance of Chinatown &amp; close to Union Square made it a very convenient base for moving around the city.Room was funky all right. Found it a bit noisy with the traffic outside &amp; cooing pigeons on top of our aircon unit. The aircon was also rather noisy whenever the thermostat kicked in. The complimentary cookies were a nice touch though. If you don't mind the noise (or you could ask for a quiet room) the location is hard to beat for the price."
143,2096,"Oct 6 2003	Like a Dieter SNL skit	First, the hotel is comfortable, the rooms are lovely, and the manager was tremendously friendly. The location is fantastic. The afternoon wine and complimentary massage is a really great touch, and the decor is fabulous.The front desk staff, though, needs to be reminded that they are not the casting directors for an MTV special. Try having a conversation with one. Oh, just try...for a laugh. You'll wonder if you've suddenly regressed into a past life where you only spoke Gaelic because they'll just stare at you like you've spoken gibberish. Example: Me: &quot;Hello! I like your glasses...very cool.&quot; Them: **silence** No, they will not chit chat. Nor will your friends ever be able to get a hold of you if you stay at this hotel, never, never, never not once. Never. There will be no messages for you even though you know, after finally seeing your friends for the first time in thirteen years, that they each called you an average of seven times and left messages, which makes a total of twenty-one calls simply disregarded by the front desk staff over a period of three days. Thanks.Then, to make matters a bit more cozy: Somewhere around 3 a.m., truck after truck backed up below our window.. *BEEEP BEEEEP BEEEP* and then dumped humongous truckloads of glass, which sounded like explosions, and then slammed slammed slammed the top of the dumpster. This happens nearly every fifteen minutes. Horrifying.However, I actually might consider staying there again, because I can't imagine that all experiences could be like this one. There is a lot to offer at this hotel and the staff can't be consistently this rude. And the manager really was so nice and kind that maybe the entire regular staff was out with a stomach virus and he had to call in a team of emergency replacements from the local Dieter School of Customer Service."
144,2096,"Oct 3 2003	The Hotel Triton is the best!	This hotel is GREAT, the decor is wonderful, beautiful and funky artwork, this is definatly not a cookie cutter hotel! We stayed in the King Triton Suite and thought it was lovely. Very comfortable, clean rooms with comfy beds. The staff is exceptionally friendly &amp; the location can not be beat. The Hotel Triton is our favorite spot to stay in San Francisco!"
145,2096,"Aug 26 2003	noisy rooms at the Hotel Triton	My hubby and I stayed at the Hotel Triton last weekend. The decor was ultra cool, excellent location and the staff was nice enough. However, our room was very small and noisy. If you stay here be sure to ask for a quiet interior room so you can get some sleep!"

1,2099,great comfortable hotel right in front of the farmers market	I have stayed at this hotel numerous times for both business and leisure. Great comfortable rooms and a fun bar. I love the lavender smell in the hallway.
2,2099,"Nov 24 2009 	Loved the Vitale	Spent a fabulous week in SF staying at the Hotel Vitale. Welcomed at reception with a hot towel after a long haul flight was much appreciated. Our room was a deluxe waterfront on the sixth floor which we thoroughly recommend. Great views of the Embarcadero and out to the Bay Bridge. Easy connections into the centre using the historic F line streetcars or just a short walk to the underground. Hotel and room were spotless, big comfy bed, great bathroom and very friendly staff. Must mention and thank Keith (Concierge) for all his help."
3,2099,"Nov 22 2009 	Modern Clean and Comfortable!	Rooms:*Clean, Modern and bright!*The bed was super comfy with lots of plush pillows + nice &quot;crate&amp;barrel-ish&quot; bed sheets* Room service was fantastic: ordered a midnight snack of fresh baked cookies and ice cream with ice cold milk. The service was friendly and timely.* FOR ONCE, I wanted to eat and drink everything in the fridge + snack cabinet in a hotel (it's amazing!)* For the first time, I actually LIKED the toiletries a hotel carried.. they happened to carry my favorite brand: Fresh, which is originally from San Francisco. The Sugar Lemon Bath Gel smelled delicious. Location:* walkable distance to everywhere we wanted to go. it is close to Pier 1. Service:*Check in: Friendly, Easy and fast. I also asked for an early check-in due to a last minute flight change, they were more than happy to accommodate. * Check out: Friendly, easy and fast. We had to check out very early (around 6am). Value:* We booked through Expedia during the peak Spring Break season. We still got a great deal, and this hotel was worth every $$ . never encountered a single problem and the staff were friendly and helpful."
4,2099,"Nov 7 2009 	It's a good thing the location rocks	Was hoping for great, but got just good at the Vitale. The room was clean, but the bathroom was just kinda average. Our request upon check-in for a morning paper went unfulfilled four days out of five and on our first day, housekeeping forgot our room and we had to go hang out for half an hour while they did their thing (at 4:00 in the afternoon.) However, the location is fantastic; great view of the Bay Bridge, and spitting distance to the Ferry Building that has a food market, restaurants of all sorts, and of course amazing views. If you stay here, try to get rooms on floor four or above for a good water view. Not sure what the city-side rooms are like. Another plus is the free access to the nearby YMCA - super friendly staff and tons of equipment."
5,2099,"Nov 1 2009 	Awesome stay at Hotel Vitale	We had an early morning fligh from Newark to San Francisco . We landed at 10:30, retrieved our luggage and got a taxi at the taxi stand to take us to the Hotel Vitale, which cost $46 with tip. We were at the hotel by 11:15 and our room was ready by 11:30. They upgraded us, without us even asking, to a waterview room. The staff was so friendly and went out of their way for us. The bell hop brought our bags to our room and after all that we still had time to walk across the street to catch the 12:00 ferry to Sausalito. Could not believe how well that timing worked out. The views from the ferry were magnificent. We stayed in Sausalito for a little bit walking around, soaking in the view and eating lunch. The kids were getting tired, so we caught the ferry back and walked around the ferry building which is filled with different foods and wares and just a great place to visit. We went back to the hotel to rest up a little bit and then off to the Giants game. It was about a 20 minute walk to ATT Park along the Embarcadero. The park is beautiful and the game was great. We walked back to the hotel, as did many others from the game, and felt very safe. The gym at the hotel was nothing to talk about, just a few machines, nothing special. the rooms were very modern and clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. In the morning they had coffee set up in the lobby and it was very comfy to sit around on the couches in the lobby reading the paper. There was a restaurant in the hotel and were going to go there for breakfast, but someone had recommended Mel's Diner on 4th and Mission, so we took a walk over there. The food was delicious and the portions were huge. Each meal cost about $10, but well worth it, considering none of us were hungry till dinner. I would highly recommend the Hotel Vitale and San Francisco!"
6,2099,"Oct 31 2009 	Best ever bed and brilliant location	It was the first time we'd been to San Francisco (but hopefully not the last) and we're glad we stayed here. The location along the bay is fab, the staff were friendly and our room was large, clean and comfy with a stunning view. San Francisco is amazing and did everything in 4 days. You must see the sealions at pier 39, go to alcatraz, have breakfast at Sears in union square (the most amazing pancakes) and go to all the different districts, ride a tram and walk the golden gate. And the food is amazing! didn't have one bad meal."
7,2099,Oct 30 2009 	Lovely hotel close to the waterfront	Our friends recommended this hotel and I'm glad they did. it was small boutique hotel close to the waterfront and many restaurants. Rooms were large and well appointed. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again.
8,2099,"Oct 12 2009 	Can never get enough of this hotel	this is my second stay at the Vitale. the staff are kind, chatty and welcoming. We arranged everything including a meal at 'Spruce' through Keith the concierge before our stay. He was incredible as are many of the staff. Massages are great. we have stayed in a king overlooking the bridge and the circular suite, the bathrooms are wonderful with Japanese style seats and double showers in some.Get a room with a view of the Embacardo and go to Boulettes kitchen for breakfast. Clean smart, stylish and buzzy in the evenings."
9,2099,"Oct 12 2009 	Luxe by the Bay	Stayed here for 5 nights as part of a mini &quot;road trip&quot;. (See also Yosemite View Lodge and Carmel Mission Inn).Had a city deluxe room, large and airy, high quality furnishings, plasma TV, I pod docking staion and enormous comfy bed. Decent sized luxury bathroom with shower and (small) bath. There were even recycling facilities in the room, with one wastebin just for recycled items!All staff were friendly and helpful, and we made good use of the concierge for transport queries and other recommendations. The hotel is right next to the bay, on the edge of the financial district. 15 mins (mainly flat!) walk to Union Square. Start of cable car on Market St is just around the corner.Didn't eat at the hotel (or use the bar, which was always packed.)Only slight negatives were that although the room was on the 5th floor, it was noisy from very early (05.00 ish) in the morning, with road noise, trolley buses etc. Probably didn't wake me up, but made it difficult getting back to sleep. There was very limited cupboard / storage space in the room: no doubt loads of guests are just there for one or two nights, but I'm sure we weren't the first people to have stayed at the beginning of a 2 week trip, and wanting to unpack! Although a &quot;turndown&quot; service was mentioned , we didn't get this during our stay.We got a 3 day MUNI Pass (18$) which you can use on cable car, street cars, BART and the trolleybuses. This is great value as one journey on the cable car is $5 and on the buses etc $2.The Ferry building over the road is a gastronomic paradise, with loads of specialist food shops, some restaurants and farmers' markets 4 times a week.Ferry building recommendations:Boulette's Larder for breakfast, excellent burgers at Taylor's Automatic Refresher, good Mexican at Mijita, The Slanted Door - great Vietnamese food. NB Difficult to get in as usually fully booked, but get there at 5 ish and ask if there are any walk ins. (Managed to be first in the line the evening we went!)Mijita was good, but check out closing times! We got there just after 7 one evening,ordered starter and first margarita, went back 10 mins later for more margaritas and main course and the kitchen had closed with no warning given to punters this was about to happen!All in all enjoyed our stay there and would return."
10,2099,"Oct 9 2009 	Fantastic boutique hotel perfectly located	This is a great boutique hotel - the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable, the room was very comfortable and quiet. It is located across from the Ferry Building in which there are a number of very good restaurants of all level of dining, and the fantastic farmer's market on Saturday mornings (even as a traveller there are lots of goodies for you).No complaints at all (which is a rarity for us)."
11,2099,"Oct 9 2009 	wonderful location great hotel	This is a great hotel. The room itself was nice, nothing over the top.....very clean and very comfortable. (The linens and towels were top notch and the toiletries were nice). My only complaint was the light that came in the top of the blinds in the morning around 7:00. (We were traveling the first time in 2 years without our young children and were looking forward to sleeping in late). I was kicking myself for forgetting the eye shades.The location is wonderful. Each morning we walked across the street to the Ferry Building for a latte and some baked goods. We hit the Farmer's Market there on Saturday morning."
12,2099,Oct 8 2009 	Tranquil getaway in the city	Amazing staff at this peaceful oasis in the city. Stayed in the circular suite - amazing views and a bathtub in the room to enjoy them in. I love the location of this hotel. Go to the ferry building to wander around or take a ferry.
13,2099,"Oct 8 2009 	Gorgeous view of the bay!	This hotel was a little pricey, but totally worth it! The view was lovely. The room was impeccable, spacious, modern and very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I only wish we could have stayed more than one night!"
14,2099,"Oct 6 2009 	Great local next to FerryBuilding	I wanted to love the Hotel Vitale. We love the FERRY BUILDING MARKETPLACE this hotel is steps away. Public transportation all around. Convenient from the stop on the Bart. Joie de vivre Hotel chain. One of the chains more pricey hotels. Spotless bathroom (but no place to put your clothes and a drain that did not drain) Comfortable beds with soft linens (carpet in sad need of a shampooing (441) Indifferent staff (sorry, but true) Did not tell us anything about the hotel when we checked in. No information in room on the Spa. $45 for valet overnight parking ouch!.(I know, I know, San Francisco) At 11am they would not even sell us a cup of coffee in the Americano. Lavender is the Hotel's signature scent and that is the nowhere on the description of the hotel. I am allergic to Lavender; Fortunately, I had CLARITON with me so I could breathe! We booked a room with no view because it was only available with two beds. Pet friendly(Did not have a pet with me) Our Joy of Life welcome gift was waiting for us(Hurrah) (With extra lavender which I quickly tossed out of the room)  Would I stay there again? Maybe."
15,2099,"Oct 4 2009 	Overrated hotel	Stayed here as part of our Calfornian road trip for our honeymoon. I was really looking forward to reaching San Francisco and excited at the thought of staying at the Vitale having read reviews on this site. What a disappointment! This hotel is a business hotel and nothing more. The staff are really impersonal and we felt as though we were in the way of the more important business guests.Car parking was a complete rip-off at $45 per night, couldn't quite belive it when we arrived and was by far the most expensive of all the various Californian hotels we stayed at.The only plus point in it's favour was the location. It was great to walk along the front to the piers and has great views of Bay bridge. It's about a 15 minute walk to Union square and all the shops.I never ate at the hotel because we didn't want to give them any more money but there are plenty of decent restaurants in the vicinity, so you don't have to spend time in the hotel bar that is dominated by the above mentioned business clients.Above all very disappointed and don't be fooled by the hotel website...reality paints a very different picture."
16,2099,Sep 25 2009 	Great value and wonderful location.	Only thing missing from the room was coffee. Complimentary coffee service is in the lobby.
17,2099,Sep 13 2009 	Great location and value	Fantastic hotel whose web site does not do its rooms justice. We were upgraded to a fantastic room facing the Bay Bridge. Much better location being near the Ferry Building than inland or near Fishermans wharf.
18,2099,"Aug 20 2009 	Perfection!!!	The first thing that caught my eye about this hotel with that it was the same as my surname. We paid top dollar and stayed in the second best room available and were not dissapointed. The spectacular 180 degree view of the harbour and the amazing bed and views from the bath combined with every comfort imagineable. The service was exemplary, my girlfriend and I joked that the staff were ninjas because we never once noticed them yet every time we left the room and room was serviced and cleaned. The little things appeal too, such as a weather card each night, the fruit platter on arrival, free bottles of water and sweets at night. The hotel staff were more than happy to accommodate any request including DVDs, a umbrella for the rain, room service. This hotel is the best hotel I have stayed at from the many 5 star hotels abroad and Australia which I have visited. I would highly recommend it to anyone and I cannot wait to revisit San Francisco in order to stay at Hotel Vitale once more."
19,2099,"Aug 11 2009	Faultless	We walked in off the street, having unexpectedly checked out of the DREADFUL Clift Hotel and our spirits were low. We'd endured almost a week of being exploited by the Clift's overpriced and lazy pretentions, which pretty much ruined our trip to San Francisco. On the spur of the moment we brought our stay there to an abrupt end and decided to try out the Vitale which we'd passed by on our way to the wonderful Ferry Building. What a difference; world's apart.The staff practically bent over backwards to make us welcome and did their utmost to make sure we had everything we needed.The room was fabulous. Having suffered too long trying to negotiate a bathroom the size of a broom cupboard at the Clift, I hardly wanted to leave the luxury of the one at the Vitale - sheer indulgence.It cost us less to stay at the Vitale than the rip-off Clift, and I'm just sorry we didn't know then what we do now. The Vitale renewed our faith in San Francisco at a time where the Clift had all but destroyed it."
20,2099,"Aug 11 2009 	Convenient and Comfortable	We stayed at this hotel for the San Francisco Marathon weekend, and the location could not be better. The hotel is easily accessible from SFO as it is located approximately 2 blocks away from the BART Embarcadero station. The Ferry Building is literally across the street, which made it very convenient to go to the Farmer's Market on Saturday mornings. We stayed in one of the rooms that were probably not considered the best because we were on the second floor and did not have a view, but it didn't matter to us at all. The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet even though the bus stop was located right outside our window, and in-room Internet is included in the price of the room. We enjoyed the music from their CD selection, the jellyfish video that loops in the elevator, and the light scent of lavender in the hallways. It was a wonderful stay, and we would definitely come again."
21,2099,"Aug 4 2009 	Excellent destination!!!	This hotel rocks!!! Staff was ultra friendly, every amenity you could imagine in =cluding the private baths on the roof!! Very cool!! Room service was friendly and efficient, centrally located with great views...Can't go wrong...."
22,2099,"Aug 3 2009 	Awesome	I got a great expedia deal on this--under $200/night before tax. Stayed here for the San Francisco Marathon, which starts literally right outside the doors of the hotel. But there's a lot else right outside this hotel's doors--Ferry Building, Farmers Market, Whatever The Name of The Giants Stadium This Year...the entire Embarcadero is right there.Room was fantastic, even though the &quot;city view&quot; is little more than an office across the street. Needing an early night's sleep, silence was crucial to me and the construction of this place didn't let me down.The BEST aspect of this hotel, as you'll see from my photos, are the multiple outdoor sitting/drinking/dining terraces on all the higher levels. Great in the afternoon which tends to be sunny and warmer in this SF microclimate.The restaurant is above average, but certainly don't hesitate to go out to eat. Lot of great dining spots in SF.Finally, they may have the friendliest hotel staff I've ever encountered. Just outstanding service!I've stayed at half a dozen hotels in SF and this has been the best, hands down. I was always a Harbor Court fan, but this place has that beaten, and at a better price."
23,2099,"Jul 26 2009 	perfect hotel location staff	We stayed here as our first destination from our Honeymoon. It sits right opposite the Embarcadero which is a lovely walk down to Pier 39. There are regular trams that run from right outside the hotel uptown and to the Castro and other areas. The hotel staff were exceptionally attentive, very accommodating - we got a bottle of Verve clique from the reception after they found out we were recently married. We have a view of the embarcadero from our room which was exceptionally comfortable and of high quality. The perfect destination/base for any visitor to San Fran"
24,2099,Jul 15 2009 	A Perfect Romantic Getaway	HOTEL. A beautiful and luxurious boutique hotel with a romantic ambiance. STAFF. Professional and welcoming. We were suppose to have a bottle of champagne delivered to our room and they forgot but was gracious enough to ship it to us. I dont dock points for honest mistakes. ROOM. Small yet cozy. We had a great view of the waterfront and bay.SHOWER. Surprisingly nice and big. LOCATION. On the waterfront in Embarcadero.ATTRACTION. Directly across the Ferry buildinggreat for a stroll on Saturday when theres a Farmers market.TIP(S). Americano is an Italian restaurant. Its good but San Francisco has so much more to offer. The waterfront alone has a few great name restaurants worth seeking out. Americano is however convenient if you dont want to venture away from the hotel.
25,2099,"Jul 14 2009 	I Loved This Place	This is exactly what you want in a hotel. Great location and service. A great restaurant and bar. Big, clean rooms. Beautiful views from the hotel terraces. Everyone seems dedicated to making your stay a memorable one, and it was."
26,2099,"Jul 8 2009 	Special	Thank you for a delightful stay. The hotel staff is exceptional in every way. They are gracious &amp; knowledgeable. The maintenance and cleanliness of the hotel is exceptional. Of course, the location is the best in the city. You are to be commended on the success of making your guests feel welcome, safe, and eager to return to SF. Keep up the outstanding work."
27,2099,"Jul 6 2009 	Nothing Less Than Perfect	I can't think of a single thing I would change about Hotel Vitale. The staff is courteous and professional, the rooms are comfortable with so many nice amenities (the shower alone makes it worth it!) and it could not be in a better location. It's close to everything but it also feels quiet and remote when you need to get away from the crowds. The restaurant patio is awesome for late afternoon drinks and snacks. We wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else from now on."
28,2099,"Jul 6 2009 	Great Hotel. Deleivered everything it promised	I have just returned from a 6 night stay at the Vitale, and loved it. What I expected was a boutique upscale Hotel, and I got that and more. I payed for a queen bed internal view room, but signed up to the Hotels loyalty programme beforehand. The rates were great. I was pleasantly surprised to have a bay view room. It was very spacious, with full amenities of a 4* Hotel. The bathroom products are Aveda, so I'm not sure what the last poster got.I found the staff to be excellent. Yes there are lots of things you can pay extra for, in terms of mini bar, extras, room service etc. But its a consumer market. Don't buy if you don't like the prices. I found the staff to be excellent. Went out of their way to engage with you. A young female member of the bell staff was excellent, friendly, and really should be a concierge with her knowledge and manner with guests.The Hotel appears to get a lot of business clientelle, but there was no attitude with us who were far more casual.The bar is excellent, with great cocktails, and a very popular happy hour. We didn't eat at the hotel apart from some bar snacks which were decent. The general food prices didn't encourage me to try more, but there are so many other options. We also did'nt avail of the Spa services. The outdoor space is lovely overlooking the bay on a balmy summers evening. I also thought the location was excellent, providing a great base to explore San Fran. I would return in a minute."
29,2099,"Jul 4 2009 	The perfect weekend	I can whole-heartedly give a rating of &quot;excellent&quot; for each of the catergories listed. We arrived at the hotel and were immediately made to feel welcome. The staff was efficient, professional and friendly. The door staff, bell staff, front desk, concierge and housekeeping staff greeted us like returning friends during our entire stay. I was impressed that the staff was able to give us such personalized attention even though the hotel was sold out and San Francisco was overflowing with visitors for Gay Pride Weekend Our room was designed with our comfort and tranquility in mind. I was impressed with the lighting throughout the hotel. It is obvious the designers gave much thought to the colors, fabrics and mood in the public and private spaces. After spending each day exploring San Francisco on foot, it was a pleasure to come back to our quiet, comfortable location with its scenic view of the Ferry Building and Bay Bridge. We visited the Spa and were impressed again by the tone and quality. It was relaxing just being in the space.I would recommend Hotel Vitale to anyone who wants to visit San Francisco and enjoy the comfort and elegance that is provided there."
30,2099,"Jun 29 2009 	extraordinary	I wish I could keep this hotel a secret! I had lived in San Francisco 30 years &amp; went back for a visit. In the past I've enjoyed this boutique chain Joie de Vivre, before, but this was a new one on their list. The area is perfect, near public transportation, great restaurants, right across from all the colorful activities at the Ferry building. My room was cleaner than spotless --it even had a canister of oxygen: very &quot;new agey&quot;. The bed was a dream to sleep on, and the outdoor terraces giving a view of SF bay were great. They have thought of everything to make one's stay comfortable, and at a great price for a major city."
31,2099,"Jun 26 2009	Hotel Vitale: A Modern Fairytale	After a long and fairly harrowing flight from Melbourne, Australia and being stranded in LAX for eight hours, just making it to any hotel would have been good enough for us. We just wanted to put our heads down and get on with our holiday.I wouldn't have thought it possible that after what we suffered we would actually be revived, revitalised and jumping out of our skin with delight, but that's what our welcome and four day stay at Hotel Vitale did for us.At any luxury hotel, you expect excellent decor, wonderful linen, a great bathroom and brilliant service. It's all there at Hotel Vitale, but we were also soothed, coccooned, pampered and uplifted by our whole experience. We especially loved our gorgeous, massive room overlooking the Bay Bridge and the friendly, well-mannered, highly efficient staff.All the little details, the ones that really matter to me, were just perfect. From the soothing sound generator by the bedside, to the excellent CDs provided in the room, no effort had been spared to make this a fairytale experience well beyond our expectations.A special mention of the concierge, Keith, the smoothest, most competent concierge I have ever met.What a great staff, what a great hotel!"
32,2099,Jun 24 2009 	Great location and beautiful hotel	Loved - would recemmend it to anyone visiting San Fran - we enjoyed the location across from the ferry terminal (which had great places to eat and explore)
33,2099,"Jun 15 2009 	Snotty and Overpriced; arrogant staff	I've stayed at Vitale 3 times. The usual decline in service and experience after the first year post-opening is happening here too.The aromatheraphy bath products that made the shower seem so luxurious in days gone by are no longer from Fresh Corp....they're now generic flavorless gels from some innofensive and unknown maker...clearly cutting costs.The port cochere where you enter the lobby is now home to 20 flies mating.I didn't enjoy waiting 10 minutes for the valet to get my car. But I really didn't enjoy listening to the remaining 2 valets (one of which seemed to be the lead) share stories about the hot girls they wanted to bed and showing each other pictures of these girls on their iPhones.There's a feeling like you'd better not touch anything in the room or else a charge would apply to your account....for instance, a personal oxygen can placed in the bathroom discreetly advises you that there will be a $16 charge. If you turn on the TV, you have to dig through the 7 major menu sections of pay content ($20 for a movie) before you can get out to the local news (last option on the menu) and I never did find CNN, MSNBC, or MTV...rooms don't seem to have full cable.And then there's the lovely matter of the small card folded discretely in the envelope with the extra room key which states that they are honored to charge your room account an extra dollar to support some local state funded/run park...unless you get down to the front desk and opt out of their scheme. Very sneaky, very tacky...and this on top of a nearly $300 per night rate. Felt very much like a poor person was nickle and diming me to death and that I should pay attention to every piece of written matter in my room lest I inadvertently miss a fee clause in my interaction with it and be levied a surcharge for not bringing my lawyer with me to protect me from the hotel's sad revenue generating sneakiness. This last bit with the $1 that you had to opt-out really ruined my sense that the hotel was a hospitality experience...felt like I was just there to be pumped.Also, don't get the Bay view rooms...they're mostly views of a building across the street and there's a 20-something's lounge on that whole side of the building whose music and drunken expense account partyers you can hear until 1AM. Vitale is located at one of the lowest elevations in San Fran...the sewer drains outside the building often smell of stale sewer. Unfortunately or coincidentally, my bathroom smelled of the same stale sewer, but this may have been a mold problem from the cutout in the glass shower wall intended for turning on the shower, which however also allows a good rain shower on the whole toilet by the end of your shower....go potty before you shower or you'll need to towel off again after using the toilet...which explains the funky smell in there.Oh, and $45 a night for parking....Watch your back with these people...they'll try to charge for more things that you'd think."
34,2099,"Jun 13 2009 	Excellent service location and very accommodating with my young kids	We were originally booked in a room with one bed. I called their reservations department and explained I was travelling with 4 year old twins. The agent owned the situation and immediately upgraded me to a suite with curtains to seperate the sleeping areas. This is a semi-typical boutique, city, hip hotel. Not the place you would expect the staff to want to deal with 4 year old twins. Everyone there could not have been better. Arrival was good, door staff and front desk were very friendly and accommodating. Room was great. Room service was good throughout our stay. I requested my coffee and breakfast at 5:45 am each day (an hour before listed times) and they had no problem filling that request. They have seating and lounge type areas on all the roofs and they are spectacular. The furniture is showing some signs of fatigue but the setting and views make up for that. Good location in SF for kids as well. The trolley loops all start directly behind the hotel. You can take the trolley to the Wharf or up California and connect with North Beach, etc...very convenient. Parking is a block or two away but that is expected with the location. Overall, fantastic place."
35,2099,"May 21 2009 	Good location and comfortable hotel with buzzing bar	Good location near the Ferry Port building and 5 minutes walk from one of the main tram lines. It's a comfortable and stylish hotel with generally very friendly staff. The room was spacious and comfortable and we had a great view of the Bay Bridge (although if you get a view you also get quite a lot of noise drifting up from the bar which opens out to a paved area).There were a couple of minor down points. We had to ask for a coffee machine. I object to paying that much for a room and not being provided with an occasional free cup of coffee in my room. To be fair they placed a coffee machine in the room straight away but we had to ask for it to be replenished.Valet parking was quite pricey (and they tried to charge for 5 nights instead of one so check your bill when you check out).The other downside was the poor restaurant food. The Americano bar and restaurant is very stylish and obviously a cool place to hang out, but the food we had was distinctly average and the service was a bit unfriendly."
36,2099,"May 19 2009 	Excellent location and great staff.	Was there to see a Giants game at AT&amp;T park. Arrived early and they honored our package, which included valet parking, even before we got the room. This is a very modern hotel with modern decor. Staff is very friendly and helpful with everything. The location is superb with easy walking distance to everything on the Embarcadaro. (Ferry Bldg, ATT Park, etc)."
37,2099,"May 18 2009 	Primo San Francisco Location	To provide a little background - I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and work four blocks from this hotel. It would be fair to say I know the area very well. I stayed at the Vitale a couple of times three years ago, once in an &quot;inner courtyard&quot; room (not so great) and once in a Superior King room overlooking the Embarcadero and bay (very nice). Happened to hit on an unbelieveable rate one day for the Panoramic Suite - nearly 40% off. The Panoramic Suite I would call &quot;the round room&quot;. These rooms are on the corner of the hotel overlooking Embarcadero and the Bay Bridge, with the infamous bathtub in the bedroom itself. First off, I don't know how you can beat this location while visiting San Francisco unless you are big into shopping and the theater, in which case a room in the Union Square area would be better. The Vitale is right on Embarcadero, and about 1/4 of a block from the Ferry Building which is sort of our local temple of foodie worship. On Saturdays there is a large Farmer's Market as well. A room on the &quot;water&quot; side of the hotel makes for some pretty great people watching up and down Embarcadero. No television required.First the good - the room is large, spacious, with very tall ceilings and beautiful picture windows. One would not feel cramped here even after a four or five day stay. The bed is soft and very comfortable - linens luscious. The bathtub in the room, while a very simple tub without the fancy jets etc., is to DIE FOR. I walk by the Vitale all the time and wondered about the privacy issue and when you're up in the room looking out you realize .... no one's looking up from the street! No one cares - they are busy admiring the view of the bay. Once I got in the tub, I followed suit.As noted here in other reviews, shower in the bath is an overhead rainfall type with simple and clean partial glass enclosure. Very classy. Room service - blindingly fast. Breakfast arrived in under 15 minutes. Now the negatives. The noise from the street is pretty intense. Unless you're from NYC or live in the city, this might get to you after a while. This is NOT a quiet and peaceful location. Expect bus and intersection noise to be a factor as early as 6:00 a.m. There was no in room coffee, and I had to call room service for two wine glasses. The toilet was one of the water saver models and simply didn't work. I would stay at the Vitale again but next time would opt for a city view room or there's a side of the hotel that overlooks a small park. The Panoramic Suite is very pretty and almost warrants a room rate most of us think twice about."
38,2099,"May 16 2009 	Excellent hotel location service views - just fantastic!	We stayed here for 2 weeks and the service did not falter once. We upgraded our original internal view booking (made via Expedia) for a water view and enjoyed fantastic views of the Bay Bridge, Ferry Building and Treasure Island. The room was very clean and spacious, the bathroom had a large &quot;rain&quot; shower and the bed linens, especially the pillows were devine.The staff were were nice and cheerful, the restaurant was also pretty good - it took advantage of the two Farmer's Market days over the road at the ferry building (Tuesdays and Saturday's) extending a special dish on those evenings. The bar seemed to be the place to go throughout the week so it could get noisy (Saturday and Sunday were much quieter) but the double glazed windows in the room blocked out most of the noise so we didn't find it a problem.If you don't have a room with a view you can easily get up to the hotel rooftop, to admire the sunrise and sunsets or even take a picnic. The hotel has a free yoga class in the morning and a small gym but guests also enjoy free access to the YMCA just a 2 minute walk away. Rooms had free internet provision (wireless and cable), a safe, minibar and very nice toiletries. Possibly the only thing to be aware of is that there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room (I had a travel kettle with me so it wasn't a problem).I think it would be hard to beat this hotel. I'm giving it 10 out of 10 !"
39,2099,"May 11 2009 	Awesome Hotel	This place is expensive, but awesome. Our room had a view of the bay, &amp; the ferry building. The modern decor looked like something out of a magazine. If I had enough money I would stay here every time I am in the city."
40,2099,"May 6 2009 	Charged me twice for one night - refused to credit	While this was a nice hotel to stay in it hit a new low in customer service: I discovered the same night charged on two different credit cards, the corporate one used for holding the room and the personal one I used to pay. When I asked for a credit Megan in reservations informed me that they had held a second room for me so they would not credit. Care to put that in writing, Megan? They made an error in their booking system and the customer has to pay? Good thing this was business travel and I have the muscle of a company account behind me. If you are considering this hotel for personal travel buyer beware."
41,2099,"Apr 28 2009 	Great hotel but service can be sketchy if they get too busy.	The boyfriend and I stayed here for one night on Vday weekend. When booking through their website, I got the Deluxe Waterfront King with the romance package which includes champagne on arrival and rose petal turndown service. The lobby is decorated beautifully and had a peaceful, serene feel to it. The people working at the concierge were also great and was able to get me a room on the 8th floor (highest floor).The room had an awesome view of the Bay Bridge and the water. Also cant complain about the rainforest shower and Fresh products, loooved the Lemon scented lotion and took all of them home. :) Location was great as well since it is right across the Ferry Building. The bf and I also got a couples massage which was only ok for me. Ok, here are my complaints. Since it was a busy Vday weekend, the service was only ok. The champagne was not in my room when we arrived like it was supposed to as described on their website. I had to call housekeeping about it which pretty much ruined the surprise I planned for my BF. When checking out thru their in-room checkout service, there were so many people trying to do the same thing at the same time that the service was overloaded. When I went downstairs to checkout, there was a long line which made a 10 minute task into a 30 minute process.Overall, I really liked the hotel and had a great weekend getaway. Would definitely come back, maybe on a less busy weekend."
42,2099,"Apr 24 2009 	Fab location	We stayed in one of the 180 degree Panoramic suites on the last night of our Honeymoon and it was the perfect finish.The view was amazing taking in most of the bay from the Bay Bridge past The Ferry Building and almost to Alcatraz. The only problem was that the Embarcadero was quite noisy. We live in London so were used to it but it might disturb some people.Service was great and the Valet and Bellboys did not appear to expect to be tipped for every little thing they did which was a welcome change.The bar looked very cool but we arrived at about 1800 on a Friday night so it was packed with local office workers.My wife really enjoyed the free hour of yoga in the morning.I would definitely recommend splashing out on the Panoramic suite. Bobby Tang (reservationist) was particularly helpful in booking the room.As other reviewers have said join the JDV club for points, discounts and upgrades."
43,2099,Apr 1 2009 	We love this hotel but....................	You have no idea where they are putting you-We have stayed at the Vitale before. This stay I called reservations directly. I knew exactly the room type I wanted and was willing to pay the extra $$$. The rooms in the hotel make a big difference to the quality of your stay. I was told we would be on 6-8th floor with water view. Got to hotel and told there is no such quarentee and was given a room on 3 with view a patch of water and wall. Went back said i would rather have a room like we prior stayed in- city view and was given the choice of the same room we had before- I was told they would adjust price- well when we got to check out after a 4 day stay my city view room and deluxe water view reservation came to a difference of 9 dollars a night- I overheard many problems at the front desk while sitting in the lobby.One couple I talked to said the front desk told them they shouldn't book thru the hotel but expedia or some other service. I was totally confused checking in and checking out. Maybe that is how they break you down to spend top dollar for whatever room you finally wind up with. Its too bad since the hotel is lovely- great location. Beware coming off the elevator at restaurant's happy hour time- the noise coming from the bar sounds like a wind tunnel!!
44,2099,"Mar 24 2009 	My new favorite hotel in San Francisco!	This is a great small hotel, with an unbeatable location right on the Embarcadero. Our room had a view of the Bay Bridge, Ferry Island, and Treasure Island, and on the 7th floor was very quiet. (The bar is a noisy scene, so I'd recommend getting a room away from that and as far up as you can)The concierge and front desk staff are very helpful, the appointments in the rooms are outstanding, and the large bathrooms with walk in shower and overhead &quot;rain&quot; showerhead are great. This is the first hotel I remember that had a small sauna bench in the shower, and another one by the mirror to use the dressing table.The restaurant is good although pricey for what you get. I found that room service food had too big a quantity - we could easily share a breakfast entree.You should be able to negotiate a bit on price, although it is expensive. But worth it!"
45,2099,"Mar 12 2009 	My new Favorite....	It was perfect from start to finish. We checked in and we were offered a warm towel to wash the travel off - I loved it! The staff was sincere and very professional. Couldn't have been nicer. Front desk, conceirge, restaurant personel, bell captains, housekeeping etc. We and two other couples were impressed. In fact one couple we were with came back the following weekend. Perfect location and a great expirence. Hotel Vitale is our new favorite. We will be back! Thank you Vitale..."
46,2099,"Mar 8 2009 	Nice but overrated	Owned and operated by some San Francisco hotel guy how owns many different hotels in the city.Hotel is nice, well located and service is good. Especially the consierge, Brian, was fantastic and helped us a lot. One of the best!!!The bar gets pretty crowded at night and is a nice place to get a drink before going out.Rooms are modern and clean. They come with many small goodies like the soho grand - oxygen, jelly candy, intimacy set etc.. fun! However, at USD 275 it also comes at a price.BEWARE - you can get cheaper deals booking this hotel on orbiz than other places. Their own webpage claims to be cheapest but it comes with a drop down menu where you can choose between 'BEST RATE', 'best rate' etc etc. Only one of the options is cheap - very confusing. This ended up costing us around USD 130 more then it should which the hotel would not refund us despite their money back guarantee.Will not be back."
47,2099,"Mar 6 2009 	I wanted to like this hotel	I used to live in SF and know that the bar at Hotel Vitale rocks! That said, the rooms do not rock. The cityview rooms are small and I saw a bunch of them.... since the first room I got was a floor above the valet parking and you could hear the bar and the parking lot. I was showed three other rooms and they were all small. Finally, the room service was not impressive. A $30 chicken breast was tiny and I got 5 vegetables when I ordered a side of veggies. Good location, bar, etc."
48,2099,"Feb 10 2009	Basically very goo.	Hotel Vitale, San Franciso 12/31/08-1/5/09It was a real treat to spend 5 nights at Hotel Vitale. The location was delightful: on The Embarcadero, opposite The Ferry Building, a couple of blocks from the California St. cable car and a 15 minute walk to Union Square, There were also many fine restaurants we could walk to in addition to Americano, the excellent restaurant in the hotel.The room we had was a notch or two larger than I expected. The dcor was very boutique-hotel, with restful pale blue added to the usual beiges and browns. A long wooden unit contained generous desk space, the mini bar, some storage and an extensive selection of snacks, candies etc. for sale. (I always immediately put these in a drawer or the closet shelf. I dont like the clutter or the temptation.) A chaise longue near the window was a great place to watch the constant traffic of ships gliding under the Bay Bridge just outside. The bathroom was rather lame for such a deluxe hotelPainted sheetrock wall, a nondescript (well, it was squarish) counter sink, not great lighting. Actually it wasnt deluxe at all. I had major internet issues that could not be fixed even after long conversations with the tech crew in Georgia. If good internet connection is important to you, sign up for the costly premium connection when you first arrive. It was impossible for me to switch once I had signed up for five days. Definitely a flaw. If it had been a working trip, I probably would have had to go to another hotel. Joie de Vivre should offer acceptable free internet serviceOr not bother with free service.That said, the staff did their best. We had a note and wine and lots of sympathy from the front desk crew. Its a wonderful hotel that I can enthusiastically recommend with that one craveat."
49,2099,"Feb 3 2009 	So Perfect!	We checked in for the weekend and loved every minute. Fantastic location, great staff."
50,2099,"Feb 1 2009 	We like Vitale a lot	We were very impressed with Hotel Vitale. I'll give you a quick summary.First, we booked the week of our stay, requesting a Deluxe City View, which is one step up from a standard room. Since we contacted the hotel directly by phone, we expressed our concerns about noise and they honored that request with a higher-up room facing south (which meant that we had a partial Bay View and could see some of the bridge). The rate was heavily discounted because of the season. After booking, we found a better rate on travelzoo.com and the hotel honored it.The front desk staff, both at check in, and the concierge, are totally on top of their game. At check in the manager on duty who handled our check-in noted our request for a quiet room and gave us the best thing he had, and we were pleased. During our stay, the concierge gave us great advice on nearly restaurants. The housekeeping service pays attention to small details. For example, we brought some bottled water, and they took the extra effort to put it on ice for us.The hotel is clean, modern and updated. It offers free wi-fi in the rooms (at a slower bit rate; faster datastreams cost $10). I'd say it's nicer than a W, but hip in a similar vein.There are multiple roof-top patios with great views -- don't miss them.Things to note: Request a higher floor to avoid noise. Bay View rooms are noisier due to the Embarcadero. City View Rooms don't have much view. Best option is to request north or south facing rooms. The bar is loud and very &quot;happening&quot;. Don't expect a lot of big hotel amenities --- the gym is small, there is no pool, and there is no cafe (although there is a restaurant, and plenty of food at the Ferry Building across the street.)Parking is really tough in the area. The hotel charges $45 + tax, but you can find nearby garages for less (we kept our car at the Rincon Center a block away). Remember, parking meters start at 7am-6pm, M-Sat. Sunday is free.The Ferry Building across the street has lots to see and eat, but can be overwhelming on Saturdays. Still, it's worth spending time there. If you want to go to the Slanted Door (a hot, pan-Asian restaurant), book ahead.All in all, I'd highly recommend Hotel Vitale. -Robert"
51,2099,Jan 29 2009 	Loved the Hotel Vitale	The location is excellent for business in the Financial District but also for general sightseeing as it is very close to the Embarcadero BART station. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and well decorated. I'm a stickler for nice bedding and towels and I was not disappointed.Also of note is the hotel bar and restaurant. I almost never dine in hotel restaurants but I did try the one in this hotel and thought it was very good. The bar is quite the happening spot and may even be a bit too loud and crowded for some people.I will be in San Francisco for business often over the next five months and plan to stay at the Hotel Vitale every time.
52,2099,"Jan 24 2009 	Fantastic experience at Hotel Vitale	I went to a conference in San Francisco and tried to stay at the hotel where the conference was being held. On the day before the conference, the other hotel raised their rates almost $80, so I looked around for a better deal and a nicer hotel. i found both at the Hotel Vitale. While usually more expensive than I care to spend, Hotel Vitale offers discounts for last minute reservations and for local Bay Area residents. The staff were amazing friendly and helpful and the facilities were spectacular in their cleanliness and tasteful amenities. The outdoor terraces are beautiful, especially at night and even in the rain. My room was quiet, although I was awoken at about 5 in the morning by a garbage truck picking up recycling on the street below. I've stayed i many hotels in SF for business, so this is not an unusual occurrence in my experience. If I can afford it or find a special deal, I'll definitely stay at the Hotel Vitale again!"
53,2099,Dec 1 2008	Spectacular Views	What a great experience! We came over from the East Bay for a wedding and get away weekend. We lucked into unusually warm fall weather and we were upgraded to one of the corner rooms with wrap around window view of San Francisco Bay and the Bay Bridge. Does it get any better? The room and staff were great and the views were spectacular. Great location for walking along the Embarcadero and lunch outside along the Bay.
54,2099,"Nov 22 2008 	Great Location	This was the last stop of our honeymoon and we wished we could have stayed longer.The hotel is set on one of the main streets near to the Bay Bridge and also next to the bay.The staff were very friendly and professional upon our arrival and soon had us settled in our room. This was located on the second flor over the entrance with the view of the main street and the bay bridge. We personally loved this and didn't experience any noise or problems. The room was small but comfortable, with every available amenity and luxurious bedding.There was an internet room available right near our room which was great to keep in contact with friends and family. We did not eat in the hotel, so can't comment on the food. However, there is a fab place opposite called the Boulevard, very expensive but the food is of excellent quality.Our only criticism of the hotel was that out of all the hotels we stopped in on our honeymoon, this was the most expensive and didn't make us feel special. As mentioned in other reviews, we received some kind of gift at other places i.e. wine but not in this hotel.Other than the above, the hotel is a great place to stop, right near the main front and not far from pier 39!"
55,2099,"Nov 18 2008 	What A Gem!!	Our 7 night stay at the Vitale was wonderful from start to finish. We had a deluxe bay front room on the 7th floor which was lovely. The view from the wall-to-wall window of the bay bridge was awesome. All off the staff were wonderful and accommodating, including the front desk, the concierge, bellmen and especially housekeeping. Our rooms were always cleaned as soon as we left in the morning. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant twice which we enjoyed. Boulettes Larder in the Ferry Building across the street served a great breakfast. (don't miss it) The hotel's lounge and outdoor bar/patio was open late and got very crowded. Despite this we never had any problem with noise. The hotel was in a great location away from all the hustle and bustle of Fisherman's Wharf. If we were to return to SF, we would definitely stay here again."
56,2099,"Nov 12 2008 	best location for people in the know	just got back from a 3 week trip in america and stayed at the vitale for 4 nights. From the outside it seems quite unassuming but once inside its a lovely hotel and the rooms are full of high end fixtures and fittings.The staff were all very helpful and friendly.As the other reviews have said the bar does get busy with the city boys after 5 but its quieter on sat and sun evenings.we were in the top floor and had a great view of the bay bridge.worth the extra money.We walked all over the centre,from fishermans wharf to lombard st,the italian quarter and union square.Fishermans wharf really is a tourist trap and tacky and union square is just dept stores,but the rest of the city is great.tip..go to shanghai 1930 restaurant,its 50 yards away,the food is great and the live jazz bands set the mood perfectly in the cocktail lounge.There are lots of other great bars and restaurants within 300m but 1930 was our favourite.We would stay at the vitale again without hesitation.A+"
57,2099,"Nov 6 2008 	Very nice and clean great location BUT VERY NOISY ROOMS!!!	I don't normally stay at hotels this nice, but my business paid for it. The rooms are nice and feature a lot of extras, like free shoe polishing, water bottle, a little card with the next day's temperature, etc. The room was clean and I wasn't afraid to walk around with bare feet or touch the bedspread. However, the one major fault I have with this hotel was its noise. I have stayed on both the 5th and 7th floors, bay view rooms, and have been able to hear the following: the elevator doors opening and closing, the maid's closet door opening and closing numerous times, music and talking from other rooms, and cars honking outside.The view from the room is magnificent and its location can't be beat. I've run along the Embarcadero each morning and all you have to do is cross the street. The staff is excellent and will find a taxi for you anytime, but I just couldn't get over how loud my room was for the price my firm paid."
58,2099,"Nov 4 2008 	Sparkling fresh and new.	I stayed in the Vitale for three nights when I was in town for a convention at the Moscone Center which is a brisk 20 minute walk up Mission Street. The hotel was only built 3 1/2 years ago and it is still looking fresh and new. I liked the location next to the Oakland Bay Bridge and the Embarcadero. In my view its preferable to a hotel right in the city center. In any case, you can catch a cab to just about anywhere in 5 - 10 minutes.I loved the modern decor of the lobby, bar and bedrooms which are all spacious and bright. The hotel is low rise so you don't have to wait any time for the elevators. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous.A couple of minor gripes. The service at breakfast was sluggish and I could have done with a coffee maker in my bedroom although room service did offer to bring one up to me.All in all I'd be very happy to return to the Vitale and recommend it to others."
59,2099,"Oct 29 2008 	Who gets the good rooms?	Traveling to San Francisco a few times a year for business, we are still trying to find the right hotel. This was our second try for Hotel Vitale, and we are not sure whether we'll give it another. We were arriving in SF from overseas, and requested a quiet room. Our flight was 8 hours late, so we arrived exhausted. At the front desk we asked if the room was quiet, and was assured that it was. Well, when we opened the door to the room, we were assalted by the bass from the bar downstairs...not even close to quiet. We called downstairs and they showed us a room in the back corner, where it was quiet, but dirty, broken closet doors. The third room we were shown was right on Mission street, and the valet assured us that it would be quite noisy in the morning. Choosing sleep, we opted for the quiet room.The next morning we asked for a better room and for $60 extra (making the room charge over $400) we were moved to a room on a higher floor, remarkably cleaner and with a great view of the Bay.Our take on this hotel is that if you pay the big dollars, the rooms are quiet and clean. If you choose a more inexpensive room, expect it to be noisy and not as clean as you would like it to be. San Francisco is very expensive, but there has to be a hotel where if you pay $300/night, you can expect a clean room and a good nights sleep. Unfortunately, Hotel Vitale is not it.The positives for this hotel are its location and friendly staff."
60,2099,"Oct 25 2008 	A little gem perfectly located with awesome views	In celebrating my husband's birthday, we wanted a quiet get-away weekend while checking out the Fleet Week in San Francisco. Great little modern boutique hotel situated perfectly right across the Embarcadero building and awesome eateries everywhere including the hotel's own Americano. After taking the night time Alcatrez tour getting back to the hotel past 10pm - we were famished and ordered the short ribs and &quot;mac n cheese&quot; which were &quot;to die for&quot; comfort food.When we got back to the hotel, they surprised us with two cupcakes and a happy birthday wish - which really made me look good - since I was rushed to plan the weekend and didn't think about some of the details.We ended the weekend with messages in their spa - which capable masseuse made up for the somewhat surprising small facility. Combined with beautiful weather, and gorgeous views - I'd recommend staying at this little gem on your next stay in SF."
61,2099,"Oct 10 2008 	Wonderful hotel great location	I stayed in the Vitale in June on a solo trip to San Francisco in June. It really was the perfect choice:- The rooms are lovely  very relaxing with comfortable bed. I moved half way through my stay to an urban studio  wonderful relaxing bathroom. - The beds are very comfortable  and the room was always spotless.- The location is fantastic  I wandered down to the Ferry Building for breakfast every day. The best thing there was Boulettes larder  dont miss it. Also the hotel gives complementary access to the nearby YMCA  great to take a spinning class for an early morning pick me up  and you can workout with a view of the bay bridge.- Its easy to walk to everywhere you need to go  but also right by the Embarcadero BART for the airport (and subway for elsewhere) plus the mini and cable car. - The views of the bay are great  and I had a meal in the restaurant too which was good.As well as being beautiful, the location isnt touristy like Fishermans Wharf, nor edgy like some others areas. The staff are fantastic too  great recommendations and always with a smile."
62,2099,"Oct 8 2008 	A Perfect Stay	We have stayed at other JDV hotels which is one reason I picked Hotel Vitale. We completed the last days of our Honeymoon in San Francisco and decided to try Vitale due to their location and their excellent reviews on trip advisor. We were not disappointed in any way. Megan was great in making our reservations and noting it was our Honeymoon. First off, our room was upgraded to waterfront view. Since it was not ready on arrival, Daniel offered us drinks in Americano's bar. We had two drinks each which the hotel picked up. We were then shown to our room which had an amazing view of the East Bay bridge. Off we went for dinner and upon our return, Champagne and chocolates were left at our bedside. Romantic is the only word I can think of due to the soft music and low lights left on for us. It was a little noisy due to the bar downstairs, but we just kept the soft music on until the bar closed. The noise was not something you could really hear unless you focused on it. We slept VERY soundly during our stay there, yes the beds are perfect too.There was a running race I decided to run Sunday morning and again, they help to direct me to the place to sign up and gave me some bandaids prior to my run. Little things that convey their committment to customer service. We didn't try Americano only because we have our favorite places to eat in SF. We loved our stay at this hotel that modestly claims to be a three star hotel. It was a perfect stay and we plan on staying here many more times."
63,2099,"Oct 6 2008 	my favorite hotel in San Francisco	I frequently travel to San Francisco and this is my favorite place to stay. They do everything right here, from the service at the front door to the amendities. I appreciate getting the New York Times, Fresh products and a gym pass to the YMCA down the block. Also, I love the short walk to the Ferry Building."
64,2099,"Oct 5 2008 	What a view from the room !	This is third visit to San Francisco and this time, we actively took the decision to stay in a completely different areas and get off the beaten track a little bit and not stay near Union Square (2 years ago we stayed at The Clift). The views from the room was the reason we booked this hotel. Well we did splash out and get bay bridge room and it was worth it - it was a suite and the view from the room was fantastic. Would definitely recommend this hotel and if you can stretch to the bat bridge room, you wont regret it and it is well worth every penny !!!"
65,2099,"Sep 18 2008 	Loved the Vitale	Nice, clean, NEW!!. We were in a basic room with 2 beds, a chair and a nice view of the Ferry Building. The room was not large, but was adequate and well designed.Bath was very nice. Good showerhead. Wonderful bath amenities. Loved the soaps and shampoo. The brand was &quot;Fresh&quot;.The bed was TDF (to die for). This had to be one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. Very nice sheets, lots of pillows. Very restful sleep.One negative: The Vitale seems to be following the current hotel craze in giving you a flatscreen HDTV, but then having no HD programming. That was very irritating. The staff was very nice and accomodating. As we were leaving, we were attempting to severely overpack a rented SUV. The bellmen were extremely helpful in jockeying/jamming all our stuff and our bodies in the vehicle. At that point, I think they were glad to see us go!Finally, the location of the Vitale is EXCELLENT!Hotel Vitale: THUMBS UP!!"
66,2099,"Sep 16 2008 	Fell in love with SF 	Our stay at the Vitale was wonderful from start to finish. We arrived on a Friday evening and it was exciting to see such a vibrant and happening scene at the hotel. The noise was not an issue for us during any part of the stay. The hotel staff was very gracious and accomodating. We were impressed by the complimentary bottle of sparkly in honor of our anniversary, along with cards from the hotel and housekeeping. It was a wonderful gesture by the hotel and made our first trip to SF all the more memorable.The location is, in my opinion, the best in the city. The Sat. morning Farmers Market is not to be missed and it was very easy to access public trans. to other parts of the city. What I liked the most was coming back to the serene decor and ambiance of the hotel after a busy day of shopping and exploring the city. The rooftop patios are a haven - one of the best spots to take it all in.For the leisure traveler, Hotel Vitale is a wonderful place. If you're a true spa-goer or business traveler though, it may not suit you."
67,2099,"Sep 13 2008 	Great Location but Terrible Internet Policy	My husband and I spent a pleasant weekend at the Hotel Vitale in May.What we liked:1. Fabulous location on Embarcadero across from the Ferry Building2. Amazing (and underused) roof deck with views onto the Bay3. Comfortable rooms. We had one of the oddly shaped Urban Studio rooms (they're concave, believe it or not), which was good value for the size. The spacious bath area was particularly appreciated.4. Wonderful toiletries from Fresh cosmeticsWhat we didn't like:1. Their Internet policy. Yes, wireless Internet was free, but that was only the lower speed wireless Internet. Higher speed Internet involved a charge. I thought this was misleading and hope that other hotels do not follow this horrible example. If it weren't for this, I would have awarded the Vitale five stars.2. The decor. The beige and ice blue color scheme was soothing, but had something of the feel of a chain hotel. And did the room art come from a yard sale? Or was it high end art pretending to come from a yard sale? Too complicated for me. . ."
68,2099,"Sep 10 2008 	Incredible view; wonderful concierge	Arriving at Hotel Vitale after 27 hours in transit was a seamless entry into a serene world of pampering luxury. The circular suite on the sixth floor provided sweeping views of the Bay Bridge, while the room itself was tastefully appointed with comfortable furnishings and luxe Fresh bath products.Vitale's location is excellent for the pedestrian guest. The adjacent Ferry Building boasts a Saturday morning farmers' market that is second to none, and the heart of downtown is within easy walking distance.Perhaps best of all was the incredibly personable concierge, Jackie, who assisted with reservations at outstanding restaurants across the city and ensured that all five nights spent at her property were memorable."
69,2099,Aug 29 2008 	Beware of noise!!!	Not as wonderful as we had hoped. Waterfront view was gorgeous but only through a small window; the staff was gracious and helpful. But the bar scene was noisy every night-- well into the night-- rendering the bar and the lobby useless and keeping us awake in our 6th floor room. The spa was tiny and the outdoor tubs were depressing- with no view and set in a corner of the roof. Room service was slow and expensive.So- we enjoyed our stay but were disappointed in the hotel. Definitely not the restful getaway we were anticipating.
70,2099,Aug 26 2008 	loved the vitale	we loved this hotel - though the bar is very popular and loud in the evening although they're the 'after work crew' and disapear by 9.30pm. Very helpful staff and great location.
71,2099,"Aug 25 2008 	In the middle of so many restaurants	The hotel staff were very personable. We dropped off our luggage while the room was being prepared. We had arrived two or three hours before check in. When we came back at 3:00PM, there were no delays. The room overlooked the Bay Bridge and is directly across the street from the Ferry building at Embarcadero. The walk towards South of Market area is very reasonable. The bedding was nice. The sitting area and room sizes were also spacious for this location. We ate dinner here on Friday night because the restaurant across the street had an emergency and was shut down. I would recommend the restaurant for non-guests and the outside patio / bar area was packed from rush hour til 9 or 10 every night.The rooftop areas on the live roof and the spa areas were also very nice and clean. I would highly recommend staying here. Especially if you do not mind the extra five or six block walk to areas outside of the Embarcadero area."
72,2099,"Aug 2 2008 	Excellent Hotel Staff not Amazing	We stayed at Hotel Vitale for two nights, weekend in July '08. We were in town for a family event. The hotel is beautiful, with modern chic decor, very enjoyable. The check-in process was quick, though unfriendly. The reception lady said the hotel is fully booked and did not offer a selection of floor or bed type. I was given a room on the second floor, right above the hotel entrance which was extremely loud. When I called to complain they wanted $20/night extra to move me to a quieter room which faces the inner yard. The new room was exactly the same (actually a bit smaller), only two floors up. I guess you have to pay for peace and quiet nowadays.Aside from that, the room was great with all the amenities (too bad about no HDTV) and wonderful shower/water pressure. The hotel has two terraces that overlook the bay bridge which are amazing. Overall, great hotel, would come back despite the poor treatment by the staff."
73,2099,"Jul 28 2008 	Home away from Home	We drove from Santa Barbara to the Hotel, very easy to get location.Turned the car over to Valet and enjoyed the city. The staff were very helpful from the curb to the room. We had room # 614 great view of the water &amp; the bridge. Comfortable bed with lots of pillows. Big bathroom w/ walk-in shower, lots of towels and my favorite, a dimmer on one of the lights. Very good food and fast for room service, great coffee in the morning only 5-10 mins. Breakfast was also very quick &amp; fresh. The terrace on the roof is a wonderful place to get away. Would stay here again in a minute! Only problem was wi-fi on my iPhone was very painfully slow."
74,2099,"Jul 24 2008 	Good service convenient location	I stayed at the Hotel Vitale for the second time for a business trip. The front desk was very helpful. The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are aesthetically very pleasing. I also got a massage in the hotel's spa. Initially we were disappointed because the hotel doesn't offer services like manicures and pedicures, but the massage I got from Jimmy quickly made up for all of that. He did an excellent job, using totally different techniques. I still feel relaxed days later."
75,2099,"Jul 21 2008 	Great Service	This hotel is amazing. We felt like royalty. The staff attends to your every need - whatever paper you want, whatever temperature you like... We had a great view of the bay bridge and could walk to Chinatown, the Embarcadero, Union Square and cable cars. It is a longer walk or a quick bus ride to Fishermans Wharf but that was fine with us since it was so crowded. We had better restaurants near us including the hotel restaurant. I thought this type of personalized attention only came in $1000 a night rooms. makes for a very special visit."
76,2099,"Jul 16 2008 	Hotel that can't shoot straight	The Vitale was a total, total disappointment. The location is very good and the facilities are fine. But service was just bad, very bad. They try hard, and are personally nice, but really cant get it right. For the price they charge, the level of service delivered is unacceptable. I have stayed here for 11 nights (tonight is the last night, I am actually posting this from the hotel), so I believe my view is based on a good sample of what happens there, and not on some fluke (positive or negative). Here is a list of what went wrong. You judge for yourself.Day 1: I arrive with my son on July 4th for a 12 day stay. Upon check in I ask whether there is any place in the property where we could see the fireworks and are told no. Next day we go to the 8th floor and see that indeed there was a terrace from where one could see the fireworks. But maybe it was taken for some event. So, we understand. I also notice that despite the fact that we are staying for 12 days, our room has no view (note a bad view, but no view  windows into a tiny courtyard/service area). Fine, I think, it corresponds to wat I was paying. None of these two events constitute bad service, but they did not build any goodwill with me. Not a problem if things run smoothly. We will see.Day 2: We go for breakfast at Americano, the Hotels restaurant and arrive at about 8 am, there are two tables already eating and we are the third. We are told to seat wherever we wanted. Service is horrible. It took 10 minutes to get a menu. My sons order arrives after 10, and mine (two eggs and toast) never come. After he finishes eating, I ask for the check (and then my eggs arrive). I leave without breakfast and decide not to use the restaurant again.In the afternoon we decide to take a cab from the hotel to go to a Jazz Festival. We walk out and I ask the bellman for a cab. He is moving cars, which are parked in front of the hotel. I look at my watch and realize that after standing there for 6 minutes, nobody has even called a cab. So, we walk out, and find a cab for ourselves.Day 3: I call at 6:15am or so and order breakfast in the room, to avoid the restaurant service and to see the Wimbledon final on TV. They say it would be in my room by 6:50. At 6:35 I get a call from Penny saying they are having problems in the kitchen and it will take longer for the breakfast to be ready and that it will be in my room at 7:15. Fine, I say. It does not arrive by 7:15. So, I call the guest service line at 7:20 and Tania  without checking  tells me it is on its way. I ask her to check and she says she will call me back. Penny calls me back and says the order will be in my room by 7:30. It arrives at 7:35am. The nice woman who brought it either was not trained to deliver room service (did not offer to open the water bottle, put tray on desk in the wrong way, did not leave cart/table in the room to serve as a table for the two of us to be able to eat, etc) or was in a hurry to do something else. We did not get what we ordered (some toast was missing), but we ate it anyway, as we were starving.Day 4: We order breakfast in the room for two people. They come and deliver a tray without a cart. So, one of us has to have breakfast standing. The person who brought the breakfast told me he could not leave the cart in the room, did not offer to open the bottle of water for me (at this point I dont expect this level of service anymore), and did not notice that there was only one glass. I called to complain about it, but the second glass arrived 20 min later (we already had eaten breakfast)Day 6: I have to stay a bit later working in the room. At 11 I leave the room, stop by reception and ask them to get my room cleaned. I come back by 2:15 and the room is still not clean. Day 7-Day 11: We basically did not use any hotel services and got used to lousy, sub-standard in room service for breakfast. It is pretty clear that the people delivering the service are just not trained to deliver service corresponding to the hotel rates.Day 11 at night: I knew I might have to take a later flight after checking out, so I went to the front desk during my stay and asked if I could check out at 4 pm (I would be willing to extend my stay for a day if that were not possible). I am told there will be no problem, just to confirm with the front desk the night before departing. So, I just went downstairs and asked if I could have a late check out. They said they are fully committed and I cant. I then ask if I can stay one more day, and they say that I cant (but they would store my luggage for me  arent they nice?). Anyway, for the price they change this is certainly a sub-standard hotel. I will not come back and do not recommend it. If you will stay in the hotel for one or two nights as part of a leisure trip it is probably OK, but if you will stay for longer or will be in town for business and need good levels of service, probable best to stay away."
77,2099,"Jul 9 2008 	contemporary and stylish	This was our second stay at the Hotel Vitale and will certainly not be the last. The hotel enjoys an excellent location across from the ferry building. Public transportation is easily accessible whether by streetcar (which travels along market as well as to fisherman's wharf), buses, cable cars, BART and the muni. We use BART from the airport and are dropped off 2 blocks from the hotel. The rooms are contemporary and comfortably furnished. We have stayed in both a waterfront room as well as the urban studio room. The spa is compact but features excellent therapists. We used the hotel restaurant only for breakfast which was efficient and delicious. We typically dine at Boulevard (located across the street) and Slanted Door which is located in the Ferry building. San Francisco is a city of neighborhoods and in picking a hotel, you must decide on a surrounding ambience whether it is by the water (which we like), high up on one the hills, in the middle of shopping like union square or in a more residential area like the marina district. Overall our stays at the Vitale have been relaxing and enjoyable and we certainly plan to return."
78,2099,"Jul 1 2008	Hotel Vitale -- very relaxing	My wife and I periodically stay in SF and have really enjoyed the Vitale. The location is excellent -- right on the water next to the Bay bridge. What's more on Saturday's you are then right across the street from the fantastic farmer's market -- you can cruise through and get a great and quick breakfast from one of the vendors with some really great coffee.Meanwhile, the hotel is set up in sort of a green, spa sort of vibe. Muted colors and soothing settings all over.Be sure to try the soak tubs on the roof, as well as the view rooms looking right at the bridge."
79,2099,"Jun 25 2008 	Trendy and Friendly	A lovely hotel. Very trendy and friendly!Great location, it is worth going to the 7th floor and onto the terrace for the view of the Oakland Bridge.Be warned, on a weekend the bar is very popular with the locals and gets very busy!"
80,2099,"Jun 19 2008 	Disappointed by Hotel Vitale	My sister and I stayed at the hotel to celebrate her birthday. Celebration also included the treatment at the hotel spa and dinner at a hotel recommended restaurant. I chose the hotel primarily because of the great reviews it had received here at TripAdvisor. The room was great. We were upgraded at check in so the room had great view of the water. The bathroom as well stock with excellent toiletries and the oxygen can was an interesting touch. Room had a nice HDTV, although the TV would benefit from HD signal.Hotel staff was polite but not particularly friendly. Id have been nice to get a smile. The check-in process didnt go smoothly as we were given the wrong key, so we had to head back to the front desk.We were late for the spa so ended up getting charged for the full process for half the treatment time. Which is fine but I would have preferred it if they had explained this as oppose to just presenting the bill. Better communication would help here.The concierge recommended the Asian fusion restaurant which was very disappointing. Drinks were undrinkable, my napkin and silverware were dirty.During checkout we didnt even receive a farewell. I had written an extensive feedback to the hotel on how they could improve but they never acknowledged it. Again, our overall experience was disappointing."
81,2099,"Jun 14 2008 	Excellent choice	Overall, the stay at Vitale was excellent.Friend and I stayed there from June 1st to June 5th. Location is really good, rooms are clean, comfortable and nice. Nice feature is the roof top terraces. Good restaurants nearby, and the light rail station is just around the corner of the hotel. Very convienent to take as it goes down market street, or to the warf. I would definitely stay here again."
82,2099,"May 28 2008 	Everything you want from a city hotel	This place is somewhat of a hidden gem - or at least that's the impression I got.It's in all the guide books etc but just appears totally unfussy and just what you need in SF; relaxing, friendly, comfy.The location gets some stick but I think it's perfect. Firstly, getting there from the airport is so easy. You can of course take a cab but I would advise anyone travelling light or in a small group to take the BART from the Intl Airport to Embarcedaro station (then just 5mins walk down the hill). It's a fraction of the cost and takes just as long as a taxi. It's also at the far end of the Embarcadero from Fisherman's Wharf - meaning there is amazing walk along the bay (passed some great sites: Coit Tower and the Alcatraz departure quay) to the tourist hell (but a must!) that is FW. It's also smack across the street from the Ferry Building. This is a gem - worth getting up early (courtesy of jetlag) and wondering over to for coffee from Peets - while watching the commuters come of the ferries. That has to be one the single most enjoyable things to do. The Ferry Building also has some the best restaurants in the area (Taylors/Slanted Door) and of course the actual ferries to Tiburon etc. The hotel is at the bottom of the hill from SF proper (think Union Square, shops etc) but this is easy to solve via the cable car, street cars or a healthy walk up the hill (20mins?).So the actual hotel...is great. The rooms as large, super clean, soothing and quiet. There is some fuss made over the city and bay views. But to be honest how much time are you spending looking out of the window? We had a city view room - which actually meant staring at an empty office block. But if you want a view - they've got it. The bed was astonishingly comfy. The bathroom was stocked with Fresh toiletries which will forever evoke memories of SF. The only issue was with the bathroom door. A slider, with poor closure. So depending on who you are travelling with.....you may want to run the taps....The facilities aren't extensive, but just enough to sort on-line check in (business centre) and run a few miles (gym) - but shouldn't you be walking everywhere? The terraces are a huge asset, over looking the bay and Ferry Building. Although when we did sit out on them, security came up and asked if we were staying at the hotel - is that a good thing?The vibe the hotel tries to creates one of serenity and calm; all lavender aromas and earth tones. It totally works. And after a days of sightseeing, walking and burning the credit card...the minute you step into the lift playing soothing music and images....it's all miles away.The staff leave you alone - unless you need them. Which is the only way it should be.One note, the inhouse restaurant (Americano) gets crazy...it's a hot ticket in SF. So if you want a quiet meal, or drink on the patio - head over to the FB."
83,2099,"May 25 2008 	Fantastic hip special place!	We stayed at the Hotel Vitale for the weekend, staying in a Panoramic Suite. Try to request the highest floor available. We overlooked the Bay Bridge and the farmers market on Saturday morning at the Ferry Plaza. It was absolutely wonderful!The location was perfect for us, we could walk Market St and the Embarcadero. Boulevard, my favorite restaurant in the City is across the street. Yank Sing, the best Dim Sum in the City is around the corner. Again, the Ferry Plaza has incredible food too. The Slanted Door is infamous and Taylor's hamburgers are a must. Don't scoff, you must try one...Western Bacon Blue Ring is the best hangover cure around.There is a wine shop, cheese shop and a couple of deli style markets that are full time in the plaza. On the weekends, befitting to the epicurian loving locals that flood the market, these places are very busy. You don't need to get into the car during the day, everything is there within walking distance. At night, it is quiet, but it is easy to get a cab to go out to party if that is your scene. We arrived early Friday night and found the patio outside packed with the beautiful people. We assumed right away it was a private party. It ended up that it was just another Friday night at the stylin' bar downstairs. Cool... We didn't hang, but it would have been a great time forsure. We also didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, although the menu did look great. We did have fantastic, fast room service at three in the morning.We had massages together that were outstanding. Before that we did the outdoor bath that was nice. In hindsight though, we spent enough time in our amazing bathtub that we probably could have skipped it. The tub is on the rooftop and is completely private. It was very relaxing with killer strawberries, rose petals and a very relaxing atmosphere.The room was gorgeous. The bathtub is huge with amazing products. In the bathroom there is a dual shower, one with the rain showerhead and the other traditional. The toilet is in a separate private room. This is an incredible floor plan. We felt spoiled and didn't want to leave. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about Hotel Vitale and I am a tough critic. The staff was wonderful. I can't say enough positive words about this place, you must see it for yourself..."
84,2099,"May 24 2008 	Great location	My brother lives in S.F and recommended this place. The location is fantastic, located across the street from the Ferry Building, which is full of great local food vendors and a farmers market on Saturdays. The hotel was what we expected when paying $350+ a night. We had a 2nd floor room that looked out onto Mission St. and the Bay Bridge. My only real complaint was the housekeeping on day one. We were out of the room from 7:30am to 4:30pm, but the room still hadn't been made up when we got back. We put the &quot;Privacy&quot; tag on the door to take a quick nap and in that time, missed housekeeping and turn down service all within an hour. We would go back - the location can't be beat. And the rooftop terrace is a nice addition."
85,2099,"May 13 2008 	Simply relaxing!	Stayed at Vitale at Urban Studio room and from the moment I entered hotel till the moment I left I really enjoyed this hotel! The room has a different layout, great deep soaking tub, separate shower and great cosmetic products. The hotel has a really relaxing atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and welcoming! No arrogancy or attitude, just true hospitality. I will definately return to this hotel! Thanks for great service!"
86,2099,"May 9 2008 	Great Hotel; Lousy Valet	We stayed there on May 7 for just one night. Great location near the Embarcadero and Fisherman's Wharf. We arrived early (10:30 a.m.), intending to drop off our bags and check out the Wharf, but were pleasantly surprised to be taken right up to our room. The hotel was stylish, and the front desk and housekeeping staff were friendly and professional. Our room (deluxe w/Bay view) was clean and well-appointed. The only negative was their valet parking. First of all, they require 20-30 minutes to get your car. Excessive, but considering all of the one way streets in SFO and the fact that their parking lot is at least a block away, I guess that's the best they can do. However, I have a huge problem when I called down for my car 30 minutes in advance of checking out (headed to the airport), and 50 minutes later, the valet shows up with THE WRONG CAR!!! Then, he tried to convince me that it was ours! When we wouldn't take the wrong vehicle, he went back to the garage and came back with the right one. He was apologetic and said they would take the parking charge off our bill. At that point, all we were cared about was getting to the airport on time, so we didn't bother to check on whether he actually did it or not. I suppose I'll find out when I get my credit card statement . . ."
87,2099,"May 5 2008 	Excellent Choice Right on the Embarcadero	I stayed at the Hotel Vitale for two nights in late April on a business trip.The hotel is warm and welcoming, with comfortable wood finishes throughout. My room had a very comfortable bed, a usable desk, ample storage space and was very quiet, despite being located in a very busy area, Mission between the Embarcadero and Steuart.The hotel's locaiton is ideal for anyone in SF on business downtown. When you walk out the front door, you're greeted by a picture-postcard view of the Bay Bridge and if you walk a few steps, the renovated Ferry Building and it's handy gourmet food stalls. It's also adjacent to the streetcar that can take you down Market all the way to Castro, and along the Embarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf. The Embarcadero Muni Metro/BART station is only about two blocks away.I didn't eat at the restaurant, but I did have a drink at the very comfortable bar. There's also a beautiful outside dining area with great views.All in all, the Vitale is an oasis in the heart of the city."
88,2099,"May 4 2008 	We were very pleased with this lovely hotel	We spent a week at Hotel Vitale. The service was friendly and helpful. The rooms and decor were upscale, contemporary, sleek and lovely. We were there as a family of three, and room was a little dangerous for a toddler based on the sophisticated furnishings. (The huge wall length mirror with ledge perfect size for climbing made us very nervous.) However, hotel made a very good effort to accomodate us, bringing a highchair to our room as well as a pack and play for our baby's sleeping. The concierge was very approachable, helpful and full of ideas. My husband and I would definitely stay here again, though not sure we would return with our 18 mo. old child."
89,2099,May 1 2008	almost great	Lots of nice features. Great free available business center. 2 free morning newspapers. Excellent concierge (Brian). Comfortable room. Good location. Two small problems: no hot water for two consecutive mornings and I left the car with valet around midnight and was told I would probably be charged for only half a day when I left earlyl the next morning. The next morning when I checked out they charged me the full ($49-) valet even though I was led to believe otherwise and wasn't able to take a shower that morning because of lack of hot water.
90,2099,"Apr 10 2008 	Had a Wonderful Stay	I stayed at the Hotel Vitale for 5 days in late February and recommend it highly. The design of the hotel is perfect for a relaxing getaway in one of the best cities in the world. From the front door to the roof decks, everything is spa-like. (There is also an actual spa at the hotel, but I did not try it.) Our room (a king size, bay view) featured soothing colors, natural materials, and even smelled good (not that usual stale hotel smell). The bed had a pristine, white duvet cover. Bedside table has a CD player (with new age-y CD collection) but you can plug your iPod into it. We had a loveseat and arm chair over in the window nook. The bathroom was large, with a glassed-in shower with rainforest shower head. Best of all, the toiletries were made by Fresh and were lovely. The hotel also has 2 roof decks for guest use and a fun restaurant in the lobby - it has an indoor lounge and outdoor terrace that seem to be extremely popular with young businesspeople. The restaurant isn't cheap, but it's worth checking out. We found every staff person we interacted with to be friendly and helpful. In addition to turndown service, a manager came by in the evening to make sure everything was to our liking - a pleasant touch. The location was great for us - right across the street from the Ferry Terminal, where we found a few good restaurants, lots of great snacks (including Cowgirl Creamery for cheese, a great bread store and a wine shop), and an incredible outdoor Farmer's Market twice a week (Tuesday and Saturday). If you're not a walker, the hotel is about 2 blocks from one end of the cablecar line as well as the Embarcadero BART station, and the streetcars go past the hotel as well. We found it a convenient walk to Union Square, the SF Moma, etc., but we really like walking. The only thing we didn't like about the hotel was the supposedly high-speed internet. The free internet service moved at a crawl, whether you were wireless or plugged in. There was also a paid option. But for the amount the room cost, and how little internet costs, they really should provide genuinely high speed connections for free (as they advertise). You may not have any need for internet, but if you are traveling on business be aware that connecting to the office won't be easy. However, in all, it's a really fabulous place and I completely recommend it."
91,2099,"Apr 1 2008	A different side of San Fran....	I was hesitant about booking this hotel as it was not in a central location, however after having stayed in many San Fran hotels even the 5 star seemed to be a bit lackluster/old and this place seemed fresh/new.I loved the room it was fabulous, modern, clean, relaxing. I could not have asked for more. The hallways are also very quiet, dimly lit, pleasing to the eye. The staff are really pleasant from the concierge to the maids, check-inThe hotel is a few blocks down from Union Sq which you may think a disadvantage but for us we discovered a whole new side of San Fran. We spent our mornings well luchtime actually at The Ferry Building which is across the street and has great casual dining and our evenings in the same area. 'Slanted Door' fab vietnemese/fusion food, 'Boulevard' across the street ranked as one of San Frans' best restaurants.We went to Union Sq one day and I was so glad to get back to the hotel, the water....so relaxing.I did think by the website that this hotel was a spa resort directly on the water it's not, there isn't a spa just one treatment room. I will advise you that there isn't much of a downstairs lobby area to hang out in either and the only disappointment I had was the bar/restaurant area. I went their one evening after dinner and it was full of drunken kids, I guess they also open their doors to the main street so anyone can walk in. Otherwise super city hotel."
92,2099,"Mar 30 2008 	Our new favorite place to stay in San Francisco	We absolutely loved our stay at Hotel Vitale. Besides the hotel being in a prime location close to one of our favorite spots, the Ferry Building, the service was excellent. The staff was cheerful and incredibily helpful and we experienced no snobbery even though we had too small children with us in such a chic hotel. We loved the modern design of the rooms, and the extra touches like CD's with a CD player, a great book in the bedside table about dining in San Francisco, and the mini-bar stocked with gourmet edibles (not your usual Snickers bars and Lays potoato chips). We will definitely be staying here on our next trip to San Francisco."
93,2099,"Mar 21 2008 	Prime location	Great hotel. Contemporary, friendly, very stylish. Excellent location with everything close by and some amazing views of the bridge. Only downside was that the bar closes early. Everything else great."
94,2099,"Feb 18 2008 	Comfort...	I am always a bit skeptical reading reviews even though most had great things to say about this Hotel. I am so glad I took the chance! This Hotel is all about comfort with an Excellent staff, Friendly and Professional. We felt very special staying at Hotel Vitale even if it were just for one night. It's in a great location, close to everything...though you may just feel like staying in for the night. Romance is sure to be in the air, the rooms are beautiful with spectacular views to match. We couldn't ask for a nicer Hotel. Book it, you won't be disappointed. Thanks Hotel Vitale, you're our new home away from home &lt;3"
95,2099,"Jan 28 2008	***** Star Service	SO much has been said about this property already, but I am happy to report The Hotel Vitale is my new found fave in San Francisco. I'm usually a creature of habit, but decided to give Hotel Vitale a try. I always love walking along the water, visiting the Ferry Building and Farmers Market, Dining, Shopping, Exploring-and this property makes a great base to experience the best of San Francisco. The service was incredible from the moment I arrived. I felt genuinely welcomed by the Valet &amp; Bell staff, Front Desk etc. The Concierges are !!outstanding!! and every recommendation was spot on. The Vitale attracts a nice diverse all ages mix of people (singles, families, couples) and is such a comfortable place to stay and relax. I was truly surprised at the quality of staff, quality of food, and water view/s at reasonable prices. The Vitale has a cozy Lounge and stylish Restaurant offering some truly delectable food and delightful service, and let us not forget about the simple comfortable rooms complete with every amenity."
96,2099,"Jan 21 2008 	Best service I've ever gotten	After seeing their lovely website, I had high expectations for the Hotel Vitale, and my expectations were surpassed. The room (an Urban Suite) was large and flanked with a full curving wall of windows that afforded city views. The decor is lovely and calming (if a little trendy), and all the materials used are high-quality. The bedding was beautiful and comfortable; towels and robes big and soft; iPod stereo a nice touch. (I would have liked a DVD player for the TV, but that's a minor thing.) The deep soaking tub, placed to have views of the night sky, was heavenly. Room service, ordered at 11pm, was fast and tasty.But where the Hotel Vitale really impressed me was with the service of the staff. They were unobtrusive but friendly and accommodating. My suitcase had broken, and after I had checked out, they stored my things until I could get another suitcase, then guided me to a private area to change out my bags and offered to dispose of the old one. Then they fetched me a cab and even gave me a bottle of water to take to the airport with me. I felt comfortable and well taken care of."
97,2099,"Jan 18 2008 	Very solid choice	Hotel Vitale is a beautiful hotel if you like modern architecture and fittings. We chose it for New Year's Eve specifically because it has a rooftop location overlooking the fireworks on the Embarcadero. We also chose it because we were travelling with 4 kids, and we needed 2 queen beds per room. Vitale fit the bill, plus it had good reviews.The bad:1. Our check in did not go smoothly. We had asked for rooms near each other, if not connecting. When we arrived, the girl at the front desk was completely clueless, first telling us that nothing like that was available, snapping at me when I asked if we could upgrade to make it available, and finally giving us precisely what we had asked for and arranged for in advance. It was very odd. 2. To make matters worse, once our kids went to their room, they discovered that someone else was already in that room. Nice shock for our children. I tried calling from our room to tell them the problem, but no one answered the phone - twice. I then went down to the front desk to tell them, and there was no apology - again strange. Just a response that &quot;there must have been a computer glich.&quot; Duh. The kids ended up being on an entirely different floor from us - and no compensation for the aggravation, etc.3. The rooms are SMALL!!!! The smallest on our California trip (we stayed in 5 different places). That might be standard for California, but the last time - many many moons ago - we stayed at the Clift and our room was enormous. So if you want roominess, you may want to look elsewhere.4. Location was perfect for us, but may not work for most tourist's needs. It's right across from the Embarcadero and the market, which is fun. It's near the financial district, but it's not at all naer Union Square, etc. But we love walking, and we walked a ton.The good:1. Other than that one person at check-in, service was very nice. They had a lot to deal with considering it was New Year's and the hotel was mobbed, as was the outside areas. They did a great job of keeping the hotel festive but not insane - e.g. noise had to stop by 1:00 a.m. 2. There is no better place from where to watch the fireworks. The roof was absolutely great, for teens and adults alike.3. The rooms are very nice, beds are comfortable, finishes are nice (TV, faucets, etc.).4. Valet parking was exremely prompt.5. Housekeeping was great - turndown service was nice at night, and they were very accomodating (giving extra for our 4 kids, e.g.)"
98,2099,"Jan 6 2008 	Good Hotel	I stayed at the Hotel Vitale the first Thursday night of 2008 as part of a quick business trip. I arrived at Oakland International and rode Bart to get to the hotel. I was checked into the room less than one hour after stepping off the plane. Bart cost $6.55 including the $3.00 for the bus transfer from airport to Colosseum Bart Station. The hotel was about three blocks from the Embarcadero Bart Station and is in a modern building.Walking in, the doorman opened the sturdy wooden front door for me and I found my self at the front desk. Check in took about 5 minutes. Halls were moderately dim but tastefully decorated. Rooms are well marked. I was in a King room on the 2nd floor (242) facing Steuart St. The room has commercial grade carpet, a long desk, one office chair, one lounge chair and the king bed. There is an in-room bar and snack tray with unmarked prices that I did not sample. The television is a flat panel above the desk and is about 24 inches with a standard remote and cable. There is a closet that had two bathrobes (soft linen, comfy). A small alcove hid the iron and ironing board.The internet access was both wired and wireless. Either choice was free, just agree to pay $0.00 online, and you were in with pretty speedy web access. I chose wired access as the wireless was unencrypted. There was a much appreciated row of power plugs at the desk level for computer, cell phone etc. The night stand had a stereo-clock radio-MP3-CD player with a docking station probably for an Ipod and a remote control. There was a selection of 5 CD's of music. It mysteriously came on twice by itself during my evening there and required a few minutes of twiddling to turn off. It was on when I came back from dinner, but that time probably from the turn-down service.The bed was comfortable with 4 enormous down pillows. The linens were fine, but the bed was curiously short sheeted--nothing that couldn't be remedied by undoing the meticulous job the maid did before my arrival. Towels were many in the bathroom that had a combination tub shower with shower curtain, sink with reasonably sized counter and toilet. The floor and walls were tiled. There was a can of 90% oxygen in the bathroom. The price for breaking the seal was $69.95!Walls and windows did not keep out the traffic noises either on the street or in the hallway, but I did not hear any neighbors. Twice after 10 PM, I heard trucks doing trash dumpster collecting. Both occasions were loud and lasted about 5-10 minutes.There was a small business center down the hall with three computer stations and a printer, no charge. The fitness center contained three or four machines with individual small TV's.Breakfast in the restaurant was quite good. The prices ranged from about $9 to $19. There was no free option.Check out was painless. My breakfast charge did not make it to the final bill by my checkout, but the clerk promised to email the final bill to me. I have not yet received it after 36 hours, but I am sure that they won't forget to bill me. I would stay here again."
99,2099,"Dec 29 2007 	Perfect For My Short Stay in S.F.	I recently spent four nights at the Hotel Vitale and can echo all of the positive comments in the Trip Advisor reviews. This would be my first choice for a business trip or vacation. A few points that I thought were significant. First, location. The Vitale is very easy to get to by car, cab, bus or BART (from the airport). If you're driving, you can avoid many of the hills by driving around the peripheral routes to the Embarcadero (just across from the hotel). This is a real plus. Also, the hotel is just across the road from the Market Building, a great destination for weekend shopping and dining out on the water.The rooms were of good size, well appointed and extremely comfortable. I had a Bay Bridge view room and think it was worth the extra money: you get a wonderful view of the bridge (illuminated by night) and water front from a couch in a window nook. It was perfect for sitting, reading and just looking out the window.The hotel staff were extremely helpful and the neighborhood has many interesting restaurants: my favorite was dim sum at Yank Sing just a block away."
100,2099,"Dec 27 2007 	Great Place to stay when visiting San Fran	This hotel is all that I hoped for and more! Great views, friendly service and awesome location. The hotel staff couldn't do enough for me. They made me feel comfortable immediately and that anything I needed would be at my fingertips. It was difficult to find a con but if I had to choose one it would be the noise level of the bar that can heard in the lobby. Really it wasn't that loud. This hotel is wonderful and romantic....did I mention a great view and great location? Will definitely stay here again!"
101,2099,"Dec 19 2007	Have found my ""San Francisco Hotel""	I chose the Hotel Vitale for its location - across the street from the Ferry Building and the open air farmer's market. Location is reason enough to return.The bonus is the hotel itself - welcoming and friendly, yet professional and detail focused. During check-in the front desk volunteered to move me to a higher floor and a spectacular view the next day when a sixth floor room became available. From the second day on the valets remembered my car. A bellman showed me where the ice machine was hidden so I wouldn't have to call for ice. Everyone was determined to provide service above and beyond... and they did.My room was impeccable. The rain-shower in the bathroom, awesome. My one room service order served promptly, hot and well prepared.A minor complaint that I hope the Hotel Vitale management will consider. The hotel offers free internet service and free it is. Also slow. They offer an upgrade to high speed for $9.95 a day. Charge a little more for the room and throw in the high speed internet and I won't complain. Offer me free internet and then nickel dime me for decent speed internet and I take issue. One other nit - a hip hotel like this and no Comedy Channel on the cable line-up for the Daily Show or Cobert Report? Hopefully there will be a new internet policy when I return next spring. Either way I will be returning on a regular basis."
102,2099,"Nov 22 2007 	A Great Relaxing Hotel 	We stayed at Hotel Vitale on our way to our honeymoon in Hawaii. This place was a great stop to get us relaxed and ready to go!Room - Very zen and calm feeling. Loved the 'Fresh' lemon sugar body lotions, soaps, soy shampoo, pomegranate conditioner. Complimentary terry robes, slipper, water &amp; chocolates at turndown. The bed is super comfy, used the iPod dock/alarm clock - which was a nice touch. We also received a free bottle of sparkling wine (from Napa of course) and rose petals scattered into heart from housekeeping, along with a card and a complimentary cold eye mask - since we would be travelling on to Hawaii. The place is really clean and the building is only a couple years old. Very hip, but more relaxed - reminds me a bit of the W. Seems like a lot of business travellers, the place is pretty empty during the day. They also had a free downtown car service, but it was booked when we tried to use it.Business Centre - Free computers &amp; internet usage with 3 workstations! I always like this.Green Roof - What a fantastic initiative! Grass on the roof with sleek outdoor lounge furniture to watch the sunset or to have a drink. I truly felt relaxed up here.Service - Didn't have any major problem with the service, no complimentary hot towel upon check-in...they missed us. As well, someone was going to call when our room was ready - since we were early and never did. Breakfast/Room Service - Absolutely delicious! Order the Eggs Benedict w/ Proscuitto and you won't be disappointed. Quick &amp; courteous, not particularily overpriced.Location - Fantastic! Head to the Ferry Building upon arrival for a late lunch or a snack. Highly recommend Dim Sum @ Yank Sing in the Rinocon Centre (5 mins. away). We are from Toronto and were blown away by the quality/service here - a local favourite. If you fly in from SFO - take the BART train to Embracadero station for $5.15. It takes 30 minutes and you can walk from the stop to the hotel. I loved this because I hate to sit in traffic...the BART was very efficient.All in all a great experience, I'm also surprised that this place doesn't have a higher ranking. We would definitely stay here again!"
103,2099,"Nov 12 2007 	Not A Good Value!	We spent a night last weekend at the Hotel Vitale. The location is great -- across the street from the Embarcadero &amp; the Ferry Building/farmer's market. We took long walks -- to North Beach and Coit Tower in the morning, and to Union Square in the afternoon. The hotel has a hipster feel, and nice design -- although the bar was crowded with a large tour group of some sort on Saturday afternoon. The rooms are stocked with soap, shampoo, and lotion by Fresh, which we loved. Overall, however, we were not very impressed with the service and feel of the hotel. Most glaringly, we were awakened in the middle of the night by two telephone calls -- both times the line went dead when we picked up the phone. When we called the front desk to find out what was going on, the manager haughtily told us he was trying to check another party into our room and they had no record of us ever checking in. &quot;What is your name?&quot; he demanded. When we told him, he said he had no record of us signing the check-in card. Again, he told us that other people were trying to check into our room, but that the hotel computer would not allow him to check them in. Sleepily, we tried to make sense of all this -- and were finally able to disengage, but it was upsetting in the middle of the night. We had a hard time getting back to sleep! The next morning, when we asked for an extra half hour after check-out, we were given a firm &quot;no.&quot; I wouldn't stay here again, and for the price, one might expect a nicer attitude."
104,2099,"Nov 11 2007	Adored the Hotel Vitale!!	We started our 1st anniversary vacation trip to California in San Francisco and decided to stay at Hotel Vitale because of its excellent reviews on Trip Advisor and its selection as a top hotel in Conde Nast Traveler. We couldn't have begun our trip in a better way. We were extremely impressed with all aspects of the Hotel Vitale. The welcome staff, including the valet, bell services and front desk, were friendly and knowledgeable, and treated us like VIPs. We were welcomed in our room with champagne and a lovely note from the hotel staff congratulating us on our anniversary - this was a wonderful surprise and a very thoughtful gesture. When we returned after exploring the city, the housekeeping staff had turned down our room, scattered rose petals on our (incredibly comfortable) bed and also left us an anniversary card! The knowledgeable concierge provided us with dinner recommendations and arranged for our excursion to Alcatraz. We also learned from friends who lived in the city that Hotel Vitale was one of their favorites and that they would heartily recommend it to out of town visitors - this only confirmed what we had already experienced at Hotel Vitale, that it is one of the best hotels that we have stayed at anywhere in the world. Our only regret was that we could not have stayed longer to continue to be treated with such warmth and professionalism. Thank you so much for a truly memorable stay!"
105,2099,"Nov 6 2007	Set the standards high for the rest of the hotels we stayed at	We started a 14-day vacation with 5 days in San Francisco at this fantastic hotel. From the minute we entered the hotel lobby we recieved a friendly welcome from the Bell men to the Front Desk where we were upgraded (without even asking) to an unbeliveable room with a panaramic view of the ocean and the Bay Bridge. Our room had a soaking tub, a separate room with a spacious glass encased shower with a rain spout and double sinks and another spacious separate room with the toilet and another sink. Our king bed was extremely comfortable and the room came with a flat screen tv/bose sound system and soothing cd's were left by the bed. There were two sets of Robes and slippers awaiting us and the turn down service at night always left a supply of complimentary water with chocolates on the pillow and an update of the next day's weather. The hotel had a media room with complimentary use of computers for the guests. There was always complimentary fresh coffee waiting for us in the lobby in the morning. The workout room was very clean and a nice size and we enjoyed massages at the spa. We enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant downstairs and their outdoor dining with the firepit was a nice touch. The location of the hotel to the ferry building and the sunrises from the balcony were fabulous. The concierge Jackie was extremely helpful in getting us into a romantic restaurant at the last minute and we have to give a special THANKS to Lucky Sanabria who took the time to notice the wine we were drinking at the &quot;Wine'd Down Hour&quot; that the hotel offered and sent a complimentary bottle to our room. This would have to be my favorite hotel and we travel a lot. I look forward to coming back to San Francisco and staying at the Hotel Vitale where the service is friendly yet professional!"
106,2099,"Oct 19 2007 	Best Hotel in San Francisco	Stayed at the Vitale for 3 nightsafter a couple of other hotels we wanted to stay in were full, it was a blessing in disguise. It was fleet week with beautiful weather so the whole city was packed to the rafters. The location is perfect opposite the marketplace. Fantastic bar which is always buzzing and very reasonably priced for a hotel bar.Photos of the room don't do them justice, the colours and materials used are top quality. Fantastic bed and linen, plus lovely tolietries. Rooms are a fantastic size by SFO standards, plus a great turndown service. Have eaten here on a previous stay and the food was very good, although it is noisy as its attached to the very busy bar area.Only criticism was not squuezing in a small lap pool which would have been amazing on the roof. Can't wait to stay here again."
107,2099,"Oct 10 2007 	Great Stay at the Vitale	Just got back from a great weekend in san fran &amp; napa valley. We stayed at the Hotel Vitale for our San Fran portion of the trip. It was our anniversary so they decorated the bed and floor with rose petals, had a bottle of champagne waiting on ice, as well as 2 separate anniversary cards wishing us well from the staff. The room was spacious, extremely well kept and clean. Bathroom was large with GREAT amenities---all &quot;Fresh&quot; brand products. We loved the sleek decorations of the hotel and the lavender smell all thoughout.Hotel is in great area of san fran, lots of good restaurants are close by in walking distance which is nice. Great views of the bay bridge. We got couples massages which were amazing, probably the best massage I've ever gotten (and I've gotten alot). We also took advantage of the roof top deep soak tub which was a great experience. They decorated the tub with rose petals, candles, gave you hot tea/water/ chilled fruit and cucumbers. The hotel also has 2 other rooftop areas where you can go and hang out which is nice and open to the whole hotel. The only downside I would say is the valet ---- very slow in getting your car even when you call ahead the day before to put a request in. Other than that, our stay was terrific at the hotel and I would highly recommend it"
108,2099,"Oct 7 2007	Hotel Vitale the perfect place for our 30th anniversary!	We didn't know anything about Hotel Vitale, other than a few reviews I read online, when we made the reservations through Expedia.com . In the past when I visited San Francisco on business trips, I always stayed at the Fairmont Hotel on the Nob Hill. Although I enjoyed the Fairmont, I was ready to experience something different for our 30th wedding anniversary, and the location of the hotel, more than anything else, intrigued me. And I am happy to report that the decision was a good one.Unlike myself who has visited San Francisco regularly over the past 28 years after living there for three years in the late 1970s, my husband had not been back since 1993. But even I was surprised at the transformation of the Embarcadero district. We loved the Port of San Francisco (POSF) Farmers' Market on Saturday morning and all the shops inside the POSF building. The morning coffee and a croissant on Saturday morning overlooking the bay and with a view of the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge was priceless!There are many new restaurants in the area that are highly rated. Thursday night when we first arrived at the hotel, we were told that there was 1 to 1.5 hours wait at all these places so I recommend an advance reservation.The hotel is very new with clean, modern design. Liked the way it has the business center and fitness center on each floor. The view from our hotel room on the 2nd floor was beautiful. The clock tower of the POSF and a section of Bay Bridge were so close, I felt as if I could reach out and touch them. The turn down service was excellent and the Concierge was helpful with our dinner reservations.We walked from the hotel to Pier 39 and then to the Ghiradelli Square before riding a cable car into downtown. San Francisco is still my favorite city in the world and Hotel Vitale made it even better. Viva, Hotel Vitale!"
109,2099,"Oct 7 2007 	top service gorgeous modern hip and stylish yet relaxing hotel	This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.My husband and I stayed at the Vitale for four nights for the first part of our honeymoon last month.The service is amazing, they treat you like royalty! the hotel is clean, hip, decor is gorg, it's relaxing, yet has a busy bar, amazing open top baths on the hotel roof and fantastic views of the bay bridge.We checked in after a long flight from London and the staff at reception were very kind and welcoming. There was a bottle of champagne, a card and flowers for our honeymoon in the room and they had scattered rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart!reception then phoned us to make sure we were ok and booked dinner for us at a lovely restaurant across the road. it was a lovely touch and saved us having to find a place to eat.our room had a gorg view of the bay bridge and a really comfy lounger chair you could lie on and enjoy the view.the mini bar is fully stocked and there's a whole tray of goodies and snacks including chocolate , little cakes and mints.there's a turn down service every night where they bring you chilled water, turn down your bed and bring you little chocolates. and a little weather chart for the next day.we didn't go to the bar, we ate out most days, but it's always packed and is obviously the place to go!we had massages in the lovely spa on the eight floor, which is so relaxing and luxurious. we had open top baths on the roof top where you lie in hot water overflowing from the bath, surrounded by bamboo with little candles around you, cucumber for your eyes, herbal tea and fresh fruit.the hotel is just ten mins walk from union square (some great places for breakfast - go to the world famous sears and the american diner across the road on the corner) the shops there are fantastic. it's about 20 mins walk to pier 39 and the bars, cafes etc. we strolled along there a few times and cycled across the goldengate bridge, sailed out to alcatraz and ate food and had beer on the pier.it's about 15 mins the other direction along the water to the baseball, another fab night out!overall loved san fran and loved the vitale - will definitely be back"
110,2099,Sep 26 2007	Really really nice hotel	Can't believe that this hotel is so low on the list it is really really nice. Very much a boutique hotel but with good sized room and amazing service - could not do enough for you. Also free WiFi. Go here - enjoy it is a great great place
111,2099,Sep 23 2007	Great Experience	What a great hotel experience. The restaurant had very good food and a happening bar scene around happy hour. Great breakfast! The concierge was extremely helpful!!!!!!! The room was modest yet hip. They even had free champaigne and 10 min massages in the lobby one night. How can you beat that. I highly recommend this hotel and we will definately stay there again on our next trip to sf.
112,2099,"Sep 23 2007 	Great hotel and location	Hotel Vitale was the perfect start to our California holiday. We stayed there for 5 nights at the beginning of Sept 07. Everything was great from the friendly welcome at checkin to the fab room with views of the Embarcadero and the Bay bridge. We were in SF over the Labor Day weekend and the hotel was an oasis of calm from the hustle and bustle of downtown on a holiday weekend. Some details: very comfy bed, nice choccies at turndown, lovely spacious bathroom (altho no bath), nice quality toiletries although a bit too lemony for me. Hotel restaurant and bar are good but there's also several other good restaurants within 5mins walk of hotel.If you're in SF over a w/e, be sure to check out the farmers' market at the Ferry Building on saturday mornings - great for breakfast!"
113,2099,"Sep 13 2007 	Perfect choice to explore SF	We stayed for 4 nights at the start of our honeymoon and it was the perfect choice. The staff, surroundings, facilities and location allowed us to relax and get on with the enjoyable task of exploring San Fran. We took advantage of Keith and Jackie's advice from the concierge desk and pretty much shaped our stay around their recommendations. Restaurants, baseball tickets, ferry trips away from the tourists etc all turned out to be perfect. Keith even gave us loads of great recommendations for our 4 nights in Napa.Internet access with printing was handy, views of the Bay Bridge stunning, comfortable bed and massive bathroom.... All top notch. Only downer was not having a bath - but hey, you can't have it all! The chaps on the bell desk were utterly helpful and took all the stress out of taxis, parking hire car and so on. Bar and restaurant were lively and the breakie was delicious. Really -don't book anywhere else."
114,2099,"Sep 9 2007 	Decent hotel but have stayed at many better 'hip hotels'	Stayed here for the first 3 nights of a two week stay in California. Check in was efficient, although it was a Friday night and the Americano is somewhat of a night club on Friday, Saturday nights so it was very loud (difficult to hear what the receptionist was saying 2 feet in front of me at the front desk). No problem though  the room was quiet enough (quieter would have been nicer though).Although the room was fine, it was not outstanding at all (from other reviews there are clearly nicer rooms).The bed was very good.Had a good massage at the spa  which was also not bad value for a hotel. Had lunch at the restaurant (Americano) which was fine  lots of better places in the city to eat of course.Had a few drinks on Saturday night in the Bar/Patio outside  not overly impressed by the waitress service. Did not think much of the scene/vibe or whatever you want to call it either. Seemed it did not quite know what it wants to be  cool/hip, family/touristy, office parties, weddingsHaving lived in the states and ravelled throughout, this comes in pretty average on all counts."
115,2099,Aug 28 2007 	A Slice of Heaven!	This is one of the best experiences I have had with a hotel. The attention to detail was fantastic!! I don't think there is a bad room in the place!! The staff was accomodating and pleasant. The decore is wonderful and the linens are so comfortable. I wonderful place to stay!
116,2099,"Aug 21 2007 	AMAZING!!	This hotel was brilliant - really was an excellent 4 star. The location was perfect to get around san fran, the views of the bay were excellent, and the general atmosphere in the hotel was so relaxing. Highly recommend this hotel when in san fran - we'll be staying there again!"
117,2099,"Aug 14 2007 	Room with a View	I've never stayed in the same San Francisco hotel twice (I've stayed in over a dozen different hotels at this point), but I do plan to return to the Vitale. While other hotels in San Francisco boast more luxuries, the Vitale has a good price to amenities ratio. It's modern with free WiFi that actually works; the location is excellent, and the views are stunning. I had a large enough corner room with a delightful view of the Ferry Building and the Bay Bridge. A few things worth mentioning if you are considering staying here: many rooms, even the more expensive ones (I had a waterfront room at over $400/night) do NOT have bathtubs. The room service breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, and the Fresh bathroom products (sugar lemon) left me feeling like I'd been working too long at a children's lemonade stand. The staff are very nice, although they don't always get things that count right (check in and out has it's glitches). Also unless you are interested in a pick up scene, the downstairs bar is not for you. That being said, the mini bar is excellent and with the sofa and view from my room, as well as the private terraces for guests, there are plenty of places for that quite beverage with a view."
118,2099,"Aug 13 2007	discrimination	The mistreatment of the prolific professor Ngugi Wa Thiong'o at Hotel Vitale in San Francisco, California. This incident occurred on November 10, 2006. The hotel worker in question still works at Vitale, where he continues his racist behaviors towards Black guests under the support of Hotel managers.By Ngugi Wa Thiong'o I checked into Hotel Vitale on Thursday, 9th November in room 640. The following morning, Friday 10th, I went for a brunch and a walk at the water front and then came back into the hotel, at around 1pm, lunch time, took a newspaper, San Francisco Chronicle, at Concierge's desk and went into a nice porch in the Americano, the hotel's restraunt, where I sat and read while also enjoying a nice view of the ferry and waterfrontfrom the window. I was all alone in the porch. A white man, about 5' 4&quot;, dressed in a gray suit stood in front of me.&quot;This place is for guests of the hotel. You have to leave, &quot; he said.At first I was intrigued by his words: how did he arrive at the conclusion that I was Not aguest of the hotel? So I asked him: &quot;How do you know that I am not a guest of the hotel?&quot;&quot;You have to leave. This is for guests of the hotel.&quot;&quot;But how do you know that I am not a guest?&quot; I asked him again.&quot;You have to leave.&quot;&quot;But you have not even asked me if I am staying in the hotel&quot;'Okay. Are you staying at the hotel?'The tone and demeanor was of a man who had made up his mind that I could not have beena guest.&quot;Let's us go to the reception desk,&quot; I told him.&quot;It is not necessary,&quot; he said. &quot;Just leave.&quot;&quot;Who are you? What is your name?&quot; I now asked remembering that the man had not even identified himself.&quot;It is not necessary,&quot; He replied curtly. &quot;Just leave.&quot;&quot;This is sheer harassment. You find me reading a newspaper peacefully. You don't identifyyourself. You don't ask if I am a guest. And you refuse to identify yourself. And now you afraid of going to the Reception desk?Why?After a few more exchanges, repeating the things, he says: &quot;Okay, let's go.&quot;By this time, I am fuming with rage, The man strides towards the reception desk. I also getthere and ask the staff to check whether or not I was the occupant of room 640. Even before any of the aghast staff had said anything, the man had started apologizing. But I kept on asking him: How could he do what he did? Find me reading a newspaper that the Concierge had given me, and proceed with such emotional violence on my person?The lobby manager, a David (?) recognized me as the Random House guest, and started apologizing for the behaviour of the man, whom I assumed by now to be the Restaurant Manager, and who by then had had left the scene. No explanation about his conduct. The Lobby manager went to get the Hotel Manager who came down and apologized for what he termed as some misunderstanding.&quot;But it was not a misunderstanding,&quot; I said. &quot;I was quietly reading a newspaper when he accosted me.&quot;&quot;Okay, for his behaviour. David will get you a room,&quot;&quot;But I have got a room. Room 640. I checked in last night.&quot;&quot;Oh! I am sorry! Is there anything we can do to make up?&quot;&quot;You need to talk to your man, not me.&quot;&quot;Yes, I shall, but are you sure there is nothing we can do to make up? A massage? A whiskey?&quot;It was clear to me that even the Hotel Manager did not understand the depth of the emotional violence on me by a member of his staff.I went back to my room called Katherine Freeman and asked to change the hotel. I moved to St Francis Westin.Words alone cannot describe the horror of the occasion, the emotional violation I experienced but time will heal it."
119,2099,"Aug 8 2007 	Loved it!	I stayed in Vitale per one week and I've to say I loved every minute of it. The room isn't very large but it's very comfortable, especially the bed sheets.The only thing I have to object about the room, is the lack of 2 chairs in which 2 people can sit to have breakfast (I ordered room service) together.The room was not at all noisy, I think we might have gotten the &quot;partial bay view rooms&quot;.When we arrived the room wasn't ready yet and they told us that you would be ready at 3 o'clock. We came in at 3.30 pm but the room was still not ready. However they offered us a drink at the bar until the room was ready (took about half an hour).I especially apreciated the hotel internet service: it has 4 computers with free internet access and a printer, so if you dont't have your laptop with you, you're still able to access internet.The location was great for me has it was close to the financial center and near the BART/muni station. ~However if you plan to shop and you're looking for a more lively area at night you should stay near Union Square (lots of hotels there)."
120,2099,"Aug 6 2007 	Hip Comfort in the heart of the Embarcadero	We met up in San Francisco with some other out-of-town family members at the Hotel Vitale who were also in town for business. I did some research and wound up choosing this hotel as a great location that would be pleasing to all the varying tastes of all those involved... a motley crew of varied ages, ethnicities, genders, budgets and interests. Surprisingly EVERYONE WAS SATISFIED!!The location was absolutely perfect for getting around the Embarcadero on foot. Several wonderful restaurants were just steps away (particularly the pricey, but OH, so worth it! One Market). If its raining or you just dont feel like straying too far from the comfort of the hotel, the on-site restaurant Americano is an excellent choice for great food, too. In fact rolling out of bed and grabbing a decent breakfast in the area is quite difficult so I would strongly recommend doing so at Americano. Just make sure you get there before they stop serving it (at 10:30AM). Americano is also a great location for lunch &amp; dinner. Anyone looking to have an intimate conversation or trying to bring together a group of people should know that this place gets LOUD, crowded, and sceney as the night gets going. Apparently reservations are strongly recommended too, as this is a quite the HIP LOCALE for locals as well. So dont be surprised to come down from your room on any given night and find a virtual night-club scene going on. And those who are waiting to get in tend to linger in the lobby. This was not a nuisance to me as a guest, but it could be to some. Also the noise didnt affect my stay there at all either, so no worries there.The room was beautiful stunning really. Even the concave window added to the uniqueness of the room. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the staff turned on soothing ambient music with the Turn-Down service each night, leaving a little quote or poem on our pillow.And now the reason I chose our Urban Studio room THE DEEP SOAKING TUB! Wow! So worth the experience! I absolutely looked forward to my evening soaks, and made sure to let them last as long as possible. After all with a tub that deep, the water seems to stay warm forever, and why get out at all unless necessary? I should caution against the Privacy Factor, as there really is none. The tub is practically in the room. Its actually sort of just around the corner and not in a separate bathroom. So I do hope you are really close with your fellow traveler (i.e. LOVER/SPOUSE/SIGNIFICANT OTHER  CLOSE).Did I love it? Yes! And I even got kudos from each of my other family members for the choice. Would I or any of them stay there again? You betcha!! Great dcor, superb comfort &amp; pampering, amazing food, and very personable and friendly costumer service, all for a surprisingly budget-friendly price and in one of the most beautiful cities in the U.S who could ask for anything more??!!"
121,2099,"Aug 1 2007 	Nice but I don't know about 5 stars	We just stayed at the hotel vitale on July 28th for one night. It is a very nice property but please do not confuse this with the Ritz or Four Seasons. The service was good not great. The rooms were well appointed, we stayed on a room overlooking the bay and the bridge, very beautiful but definitely noisy and we were on the 6th floor! They give you a noise machine to block it out, but at this price point should you really need a noise machine? You are facing the Embarcadero and motorcycles drive up and down this all night ...yes even at 3am! The decor is earthy and trendy... minimilistic. Beware of the parking charge $42.00! And the occupancy tax on top of the other taxes! It pushed the cost to well over $400 a night! I think for that price I would rather just stay at the Ritz or Four Seasons. The location of this hotel is very good as you are close to a lot as long as you like to walk a bit. Overall nice, good experience, not great."
122,2099,"Jul 28 2007 	Ab Fab	What a place. Its trendy and hip, even for forty somethings with a teenager in tow. Some confusion about the room, not the hotels fault, we were offered free drinks, and two free breakfasts in compensation. Great location, just off the Embarcadero. 30 mins walk to Fisherman's Wharf, if you can't catch a streetcar.Recommend Boulevard restaurant across the road, but not cheap"
123,2099,"Jul 10 2007 	Great Hotel be careful about the location of your room	We recently stayed at Hotel Vitale over July 4th. Fabulous hotel, new, hip, chic....Very similar in feel to a &quot;W Hotel,&quot; only nicer. If you are looking for a mid priced hotel looking at the bay and near the Ferry Building, look no farther. The only negative I would warn travelers about is the noise potential based on the location of your room. The front desk pushed what they call their &quot;Bay View&quot; rooms, but what they don't tell you is that some are directly over their outdoor restaurant and bar. The night we were there turned out to be extremely busy for the outdoor bar, and the noise was almost unbearable. Even the &quot;noise machine&quot; located by the bed couldn't drown out the noise. Upon checkout the front desk said their partial &quot;bay view&quot; rooms and city view rooms were the most quiet. If you do choose to opt for the full bay view, I would recommend you stay on floor 5 or higher."
124,2099,"Jul 2 2007 	Hip Well Located Friendly	Stayed at Hotel Vitale in June for Father's day. My wife, myself and my two kids (age 12 and 14) aren't really hip enough for this hotel, but we went anyway. We weren't disapointed. We took one of the family suites (one on each floor with two queen beds). Although this place is mostly for the late night see and be seen crowd everyone at the hotel treated us like we were their favorite guests. Special thanks go to the desk clerks who gave us big &quot;we're happy to see you again&quot; greetings every time we walked through the lobby. The bathtub was big and comfortable (one of my pet issues in hotels) and the amenities provides were more than we expected. Our room was quiet and comfortable. CD's in the room with different kinds of music were a nice touch."
125,2099,"Jun 12 2007 	Believe the reviews!	Hotel Vitale really is a cut above. The rooms are beautifully furnished, and ours had a spectacular view of the Bay Bridge and Ferry Building. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Often you might expect the staff at high-end &quot;chic&quot; hotels to be snooty or elitist- the staff here could not have been more helpful and pleasant. The bathrooms are a real treat- waterfall showers, glass walled shower, clean and attractive. However, there is little privacy to be had- the bathroom has an industrial-style sliding door (not a pocket door) with 2&quot; gaps on either side between the wall and door. Anyone passing by the bathroom will be able to see you in the shower!Skip the Americano restaurant unless you're visiting for drinks during the very popular after-work social hours. The menu is very pricey, and while the food is good the restaurant does not live up to its cost. The upholstery was in surprisingly bad shape and the wait staff was so-so. I would highly recommend this hotel to any San Francisco visitors. Be aware that it is a 20-30 minute walk to the touristy Union Square and Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf areas. The location, however, is adjacent to the financial district and the recently renovated Ferry Building with its many celebrated restaurants."
126,2099,"Jun 9 2007 	Left My Heart In San Francisco	San Francisco has never really been on my radar as a must visit place. How wrong I was. Without doubt this is now my favourite city on the planet.The warmth and diversity of the people. All filled with civic pride and useful what to see tips. The charm and individuality of the neighbourhoods. The vibrancy of the bars and restaurants  I could go on but this review is really about the hotel.Hotel Vitale is top class. Located in the Mission district right on the Embarcadero it is the perfect start point for exploring the key SF attractions. I booked 2 advance seats on a shared van ride (supershuttle) to get to/from the airport. Reasonable rate at $70 for 2 roundtrip (including tip). This is a first come first served basis but we only had to wait 5 mins. At the airport you have to look for a representative in a green jacket. It is not possible to just deal with the driver. From memory it took about 20 mins in bust traffic.On arrival at the Vitale the bell staff are super friendly and will unload your cases and wait patiently while you check in.Hot towels are offered in the super chic reception area. Front desk staff were very welcoming and offered a free upgrade right from the start. Answered all questions efficiently and provided a city map for orientation.Really nice bell guy showed us to our room and explained that he had only move to SF a year ago and was still experiencing the city like a tourist. He engaged us in a easy conversation about our interests and made various recommendations including a trip to Sausaltio from the ferry building almost directly opposite (do this it is a beautiful place). Would also recommend the evening Alcatraaz trip (book well in advance).This guys helpfulness was only surpassed by the concierge who came up with the perfect options for whatever we requested.Room was immaculate and bathroom was a dream. Walk in rainfall shower and brimming with expensive toiletries. Excellent furnishings and super comfy bed/pillows. CD player with a selection of compilations. Ambient noise maker (whales, running water etc  nice touch). LCD TV and a well stocked mini bar including a Lovers kit ?. 2nd floor Room with bay view directly over the bar. Agree with all the other comments about the huge happy hour crowds and noise. We didnt manage to get an evening drink in the bar but the noise wasnt an issue for us as we were generally out late. If you dont like noise and like an early night  book a higher floor if you are on the bay side. The room seemed a bit small after coming from our five room suite in The Hotel at The Mandalay Bay (but what wouldnt)We had mentioned it was our anniversary. 10 minutes after arrival there was a knock on the door with a bottle of complimentary champagne and a card from the front desk staff. The first glass hadnt been emptied before there was another knock which was the housekeeping manager who presented us with a picture frame and another hand written anniversary card. It didnt stop there  The second night saw a fresh bunch of Daffs with another card. The last night it was rose petals on the bed. Housekeeping was perfect. Free office / internet service on the second floor. Free yoga class in the gym. Amazing room service.Having stayed in top hotels all over the world I can say that I have never experienced this level of service.You must visit this hotel."
127,2099,"May 29 2007	Book the Hotel Vitale it is worth it	My husband and I just spent two lovely days at the Hotel Vitale for a get away to San Francisco. What stands out to me is the service and friendliness of the staff. Never a grumpy face, anything we asked for was done with quickness and an &quot;of course we can&quot; attitude. Truly delightful.The location is my favorite in the city, right on the Embarcadero. We had a Superior King view room on the 7th floor and it was perfect. Just enough of a view to keep me at the window watching the ships on the bay and of course people watching.Friday night did have a huge after work crowd at the bar, but Saturday night was very light.We drank champaigne up on the terrace overlooking the Ferry Building and loved the quiet of the city.We caught a movie that was out in limited release at the Embarcadero center just a short walk away. there are many places to eat, try Delancey Street Restaurant, it is run by recovering addicts and the food is great for a very reasonable price. Yes, hotels in the city can be expensive, but you feel like you are getting your money's worth at the Vitale. From the unigue design of the rooms, to the service and the location."
128,2099,"May 25 2007 	Awesome place	I love this hotel! Arrived off the Virgin flight into SFO and into the cool and calm lobby, which has a great feel, and checked in to the first surprise, they had upgraded us to a panoramic suite and then on showing us up, on a beautiful day, we had to stop and take in the view. It's awesome, as was the suite itself. Very spacious, great fixtures and fittings, loads of space to play, work, relax - you could have a cocktail party in it.I liked the amenities, particularly the Bose Soundock to plug the iPod into (and charge it, which is now just a basic requirement that so many places don't get), the very well stocked mini bar (and not a rip off either), the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom and shower were lovely (though a little more water pressure would be cool), the lobby area a little oddly shaped and not really enough wardrobe space for a long stay, but this was a minor negative.We found the staff charming and attractive. All our requests were efficiently and politely handled. I particularly liked the explanation on check-in of the charges they would apply to my card, I wish many more hotels would be that honest and up front.The views really do make it however, I would strongly advise a waterfront room, when the fog clears and sun comes out, you get a great sense of wellbeing with karma of the place and the light!A week later I came back this time to a deluxe waterfront king, no Soundock but still a great room nonetheless.One thing to be aware of, the bar and outside deck are extremely popular in the early evening, do not bank on getting a table!"
129,2099,"May 15 2007 	My favorite hotel in SF	This way my first visit to this hotel, and certainly won't be my last. I booked it based primarily on what a friend described as her &quot;favorite place to stay in SF,&quot; which pretty much describes it for me too.The hotel is in a great location, at least in my opinion, along the Embarcadero area, and at night, I found it to be quieter and safer than other areas I've stayed. The staff were all helpful and incredibly courteous. I asked for a toothbrush, and they called me two minutes later to say the valet was outside my door but wouldn't knock because I had a &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the outside. I opened the door and found him with 2 toothbrushes.I stayed in one of the panoramic suites and found the room to be well appointed with a bit of a modern touch. I loved the rainfall shower and the bathroom in general, and the soaking tub is great for a romantic getaway (I've taken probably 3 baths in the last 10 years of my life, two of which were at Hotel Vitale). The views from the panoramic suite were stunning.Breakfast in the Americano Restaurant was a bit disappointing and overpriced, but even still, I do not hesitate to give this hotel 5 stars. I'll be back, for sure."
130,2099,"May 13 2007 	Simply Awesome!!!!!	All I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!! I booked a circular suite (7th floor - the highest one available) because of a) a king bed, b) the view and c) the soaking tub. The hotel is extremely calm and peaceful, and it smells good everywhere you go. What really sets it apart, though, is the service. My husband and I are here celebrating our anniversary. I mentioned this when booking the room. We arrived 3 hours before check in, and the woman at the front desk was extremely friendly and polite. As it turned out, our room was ready (we were expecting to have to store our luggage). The view of the bay bridge is absolutely incredible. Around 10 minutes after we got into our room, (the luggage was brought up immediately following), a bellhop arrived with a bottle of sparkling wine, glasses, a plate with strawberries, grapes, dates, a fresh apricot and apple and a card that said how much the hotel appreciated our staying there. We (of course!) drank and ate, and then wandered out to the ferry building and down the Embarcadero. We returned a few hours later to find a vase filled with fresh flowers, roses and stargazer lilies (I think...I'm no flower expert but they smell really good) and a handwritten hallmark card wishing us a happy anniversary and signed from the housekeeping staff. We felt incredibly well taken care of and are so impressed at how far everyone went out of their way to make us feel special. As all of the previous reviews have stated, the bath products smell better than anything, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The automatic shades are awesome too - the sun would have woken us waaaay to early if not for those. One last note - we do not regularly spend $700. on a hotel room - this was a splurge for our anniversary. We will be returning to SF after a conference and staying at thbe 4 Seasons (also a splurge for us). I have doubts that they could ever beat our experience here....but we'll see! By the way....I'm writing this from the hotel as we wait for our massage appointments at 11 am."
131,2099,"May 10 2007	Mostly Great	I've stayed at this hotel 3 times so far this year for business. Overall I'm extremely pleased with this hotel. The valet and front desk folks are very pleasant and helpful. The rooms (standard) are very comfortable with nice bedding, very clean bathrooms and a nice layout. I very much appreciate the free in-room internet access. I should know how the gym is, but I'm apparently too lazy to walk down the hall.Couple of places for improvement:1.) The wait for room service can sometimes be 45 minutes or more. Even on weeknights. Even for just a salad and a dessert.2.) The towels in the bathroom are awful. Very thin and very scratchy. I can never understand why I can get towels at Target for cheap that are 10x better and hotels rarely have soft towels. At $200+ per night I expect nice towels.And something that I don't fault the hotel for, but FYI - the bar at the onsite restaurant is this yuppy singles spot starting right after work. Makes me disinterested in eating there for dinner - after a long day of trying to impress people at the office the last thing I want to worry about is impressing strangers. But there are plenty of food options in the neighborhood, and the food via room service (once it gets to you) is great, so not a big deal.I've never stayed anywhere else in SF so can't really compare it to anything. But overall am very pleased with it."
132,2099,"May 9 2007	Great Location and Views but......	My husband and I checked into the Hotel Vitale for a getaway weekend to San Francisco. We had heard that the hotel was terrific and certainly well located...right across from the Ferry Building at the Embarcadero. As we pulled up to the valet, I got the impression that this was another one of these &quot;chic, hip hotels&quot; when I saw lots of 20 and 30 somethings in head to toe black. Our room was exactly as promised....lovely view, nice king bed and modern bathroom with Fresh amenities. As I began to look a little closer, however, I noticed a fairly heavily stained carpet, and a rather austere look to the room. I sat in a comfy chair near the window while my husband was connecting our laptop. While reading, I realized that I was hearing lots of conversation and chatter. I looked out the window and there was the 20 something crowd just a few floors down enjoying a very busy happy hour. The noise was disturbing, so we called downstairs to request a room on a higher floor. We were told that there were no other rooms similar to the one we had booked, but the front desk was suggesting that we take a room without a view and that we would be credited for the difference in price. We decided at that point that we did not want to stay at the hotel anyway....it just seemed like it might not fit our style. We're a well traveled couple in our early 50's and we've stayed at lots of different style hotels...but this was not exactly the kind of warm, inviting hotel that we usually stay at. True, the views are lovely and the location superb.....but at these prices, I want a quiet, clean room that is really catering to my needs. Next time, I'll opt for the non-trendy hotel. We were lucky to be reimbursed for our deposit and moved elsewhere."
133,2099,"Apr 29 2007 	Great stay during our honeymoon	My partner and I booked a suite for a 2 night stay during our honeymoon in Jan 07, and had the most amazing time. We were put in a suite on the 7th (top) floor, and the 270' view really is as amazing as the website indicates. So many staff members congratulated us on our civil union, in a friendly-but-not-intrusive kind of way. We were given a complimentary bottle of champagne, rose petals were scattered on our bed -- all in, we were made to feel special.Breakfast in the room is served elegantly, and is super high quality. We very rarely take baths, instead preferring the shower, but we couldn't resist this one, with its view of the Bay Bridge.Absolutely recommended."
134,2099,"Apr 26 2007	Best Hotel in S.F.	My wife and I stayed at the Vitale at the end of March. We had the best stay. The staff were very helpful. The hot towels at check-in were a great touch. Our room was spacious with a killer view of the Bay Bridge. The bathroom was luxurious with the RainForest shower and premium FRESH bath products were amazing. The Friday happy hour was packed (almost too packed to get a drink, but oh well!). We didn't eat at the Americano restaurant but I heard from another guest it wasn't that good. Everything else was perfect. The location of the hotel can't be beat. You are right across from the Ferry Building and 2 blocks to the F-Line or BART. We will definetly stay here again."
135,2099,"Apr 24 2007 	Hotel = Wonderful; Bartenders = the worst...ever	While I am a resdent of San Francisco, my company's local office frequently hosts events for associates from around the world. We recently hosted one such event and I was put up in the hotel--to my wife's changrin. It was a nice stay. The room was great, the atmosphere was wonderful and the location superb. My only complaint is the service in the restaurant. At the end of each day, everyone would meet downstairs for a couple of cocktails before going out to eat. For an entire week, we all had the worst bar service...ever. Slow, unresponsive with a lackluster approach to customer service that borders on maligned. I find it astounding that Hotel Vitale is unable/unaware to rectify this problem. Waiting for service while the bartenders talk it up with each other and the general waitstaff at the expense of paying customers is just wrong--every day for 6 days straight is astounding really.WMHSan Francisco"
136,2099,"Apr 24 2007 	Fantastic in many ways	The Hotel Vitale is amazing for many reasons. It has about as perfect a location as you could desire as it is super close to almost all the public transport in SF and is right on the Embarcadero. Its location directly across from the Ferry Building is a huge bonus for people who love delicious restaurants and beautiful food-related shops.Staying at the Vitale is a relaxing experience from the minute you walk in the door. The hotel lobby is modern and beautiful, and the entire hotel has a delicate spa-like smell. The rooms are well-appointed with a comfortable bed, flat-screen TV and lovely bathroom. The rooms are modern and very clean. If you don't mind paying a premium, get a room with Bay views. I didn't try the spa, but if the hotel itself is anything to go by, I am sure it is great.The staff are professional and friendly and you feel like they are really happy that you are staying with them. There are a lot of hotels to choose from in San Francisco, and this is definitely one to consider."
137,2099,"Apr 22 2007 	Wish I could move in!!!	I booked this hotel based on the past reviews and I can say the past travelers did not lie!I booked this room for one night on the way out of SF. We went to Napa Valley and spent one night at the end of our trip in SF. It was for my husband's birthday so I booked the nicer King room, which I believe is the King Deluxe Waterview room. When we arrived, they upgraded us (for no reason) to the King Circular Suite. This room was AWESOME!!!! I hope that some of you are lucky enough to enjoy this room!!! The room was very big and spacious, it had 6 picture windows overlooking the Bay Bridge and the Ferry Building. Aside from the great views, these rooms have great features such as the rainshower, a Bose stereo, flat panel TV, remote control window shades (this may be particular to this room), high quality linens....The list goes on! The location is great and close to everything - we had a car but I can't imagine anyone having problems seeing the sites from this location. The staff was very friendly and welcoming upon our arrival and anytime we had a question.I wouldn't hestitate to recommend this hotel to anyone!!!"
138,2099,"Apr 19 2007 	Excellent Hotel	In our 16 days trip in US we have stayed in 7 different hotels and Vital was by far the best one.Because: a) the general atmosphere and energy of the hotel was superb. b) the service was excellent; personnel has been very attentive and at the same time simple, gentle and efficient c) decoration was very nice both in the room and the public areas of the hotel d) location very convenientWe stayed (three nights) in a room facing the back of the building and a roof with ventilators etc. We wanted a very quiet room and after checking two other rooms ended in this room without view but cozy and indeed very quiet and (we preferred that over a room facing Mission Street with window from floor to ceiling which we felt less cosy and more exposed).Room was spacious and very clean, the bed very good (but not excellent), nice bathroom, all the standard amenities plus free wireless internet and flat TV. (rooms looks better in reality then in the hotels website.We had breakfast in Americano which was ok (nothing special) but lacked fresh orange juice, cheese, ham etc that we usually eat in Europe.We are very happy to have discover this excellent hotel."
139,2099,"Apr 11 2007 	Great Experience at the Vitale	While planning a quick two night trip to SF I was impressed with the Hotel Vitale's web sight and after talking to a friend who lives in the Bay area, I decided to book a room.I was not disappointed one time during my stay...I found the staff professioinal and courteous. Had a great room on the 8th floor over looking the bridge. The room was comfortable yet stylish .....recently some of the hotel rooms have taken on an almost cookie cutter appearance....all the W's, Ritz etc. have the same general appearance regardless of the city. This was not the case at the Vitale.Previously I have stayed at the Campton and the Clift among others....although they were not an unpleasant experience, there was also nothing memorable about them. Enjoyed the energy of the hotel and will be going back soon."
140,2099,"Mar 31 2007 	Best hotel in San Francisco	We booked the hotel primarily for it's location across from the Ferry Building so we could roll out of bed, go for a run then SHOP the Saturday farmers' market. Also right across the street from a great restaurant, Boulevard. It turned out to be the best hotel (out of about 30) that I have stayed at ever in SF. Beautiful room with a view of the Bay Bridge lights at night and the boats on the bay. Whisper quiet room on the 7th floor (very rare in SF). Excellent friendly staff. Reasonably priced 1 hour massage. Will be back over and over.Spend the extra $100 for a bay view room, well worth it."
141,2099,"Mar 26 2007 	Perfect stay for our 5 year anniversary	My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Vitale for three nights to celebrate our 5th anniversary, and it was absolutely wonderful. The rooms were gorgeous - modern but comfortable and sparkling clean. We stayed in a river view king and had an amazing view of the Bay Bridge, and the newly refurbished Ferry Building. The bathroom was large and had a rainfall shower. The room had nice touches like coffeetable books and a cd player with some ambiance cds that we liked. Also, really nice bathrobes and slippers.We ate one breakfast in the Americano restaurant and one by room service - for both, the food was delicious and the service prompt and courteous. All of the staff - the valet, bell captain, front desk staff, and concierge were all friendly and knowledgeable. They even sprinkled our bed with rose petals and gave us a free bottle of champagne and gourmet chocolates, just because we mentioned our anniversary!The location was perfect - directly on the Embarcadero - not the touristy Fisherman's Wharf part, but the picturesque part with the newly refurbished Ferry Building which has gourmet food stalls and cute shops and hosts a farmer's market on a few mornings. Only a few blocks of walking to reach either the must-do-once trolleys or the very convenient mass transit which will take you anywhere in the city in a matter of minutes.I just can't say enough good things about this hotel. We do a lot of travelling, and I have to say this one makes my top 10 list. Probably our favorite hotel in the US. Can't wait to go back...Outstanding!!!!"
142,2099,"Mar 24 2007	Best Hotel in the USA	The Hotel Vitale in San Francisco was amazing. We hesitated over the price ,100 dollars more than we had in mind, but it was well worth the extra. Fabulous style, brilliant service, lavish hotel feel in what is a small waterside ultra modern minimalist hotel. Just fabulous aesthetic and cool cool surroundings. The restaurant was out of this world in terms of food and ambience and all bang across the road from the Ferry building full of interesting shops and bars, and on the side of the Bay. I was so glad we hadn't gone for the more crowded ambience of Union Square when I did get round to seeing it, as the Hotel Vitale just embodies everything you want from a few days in San Francisco. I thought the Spa was a bit pricey but it was booked up so coudn't get a go in there, but the rest of it, gorgeous beds, divine linen, lovely people was superb. We travelled from here up the West Coast and then to Texas and on to New York and we didn't hit a hotel like this one."
143,2099,"Mar 19 2007 	Lovely but possibly overrated?	This is a beautiful boutique hotel. That being said, I was a little down about my stay there. We booked a waterfront deluxe room, which was very , very nice. The problem we encountered was the noise from Americano Bar right below us. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is quite the bar scene outside. And if you are young, single and beautiful, it's a great place to be. If you are older, tired and sleep lightly, a third floor room above the bar is a very bad idea. You can practically hear individual conversations, with the window closed and the drapes pulled. However, the front desk staff were very gracious and moved us to another room, on a higher floor. Kudo's to them. Unfortunately, we left behind a more deluxe bathroom, the waters given to us at turndown, one less chair and no paper in the morning. I guess they forgot they moved us. I can't help but wonder how often people request a move from the third or fourth floors. To be fair, it was a Thursday night and the weather had been absolutely beautiful. However, hotel staff told us that this happens every Thursday/Friday/Saturday night. If you are going to stay here and you want a deluxe water view room, ask for a room above the 5th floor.My only other quibble; almost $50.00 charged for Valet Parking...WOW! I've stayed in fine hotels all over the world and never paid almost $50.00 for less than 24 hours of parking. I guess my expectations were much higher than this hotel could meet. I would not stay here again. If you are a design devotee, love a hip atmosphere and are under 40, and have the money, this is the place for you. Otherwise, be warned."
144,2099,"Mar 19 2007 	Will definitely return!	I loved Hotel Vitale! I went on a much needed mom-of-3-kids get-away by myself, and I picked a great place to spend 24 hours. The service was excellent, the room was beautiful and clean...the linens to die for!...the restaurant was fantastic! I have zero complaints. I did the bath on the rooftop under the stars...what a treat! Went for a run along the waterfront, shopped at Union Square...had a great weekend. I will definitely return to Hotel Vitale next time I need some R&amp;R."
145,2099,"Mar 17 2007 	Exceptional stay at the Vitale	I'd stayed at the Vitale on four previous business trips and had pleasant experiences marred only by the pretentious indifference of some staff members. Someone clearly is doing something right, because this visit (a combination of business and pleasure) was exceptional in every way. The young folks behind the reception desk were warm and welcoming. The concierge, Keith, was extremely helpful. The service in the hotel's restaurant was swift and solicitious, and the food (we had only breakfasts) was first-rate. Our well-appointed room was scrupulously clean,. My wife enjoyed an excellent massage and yoga classes (remarkably, the latter were free) in a beautiful spa/studio on the hotel's top floor. Our four-day visit was wonderfully restful. We will definitely be back!"
146,2099,"Mar 17 2007 	loved it	most amazing hotel such a comfy bed, spa wonderful and the hotel team very helpful.My only complaint would be the americano restaurant, thinks it is better than it is, ok it is upmarket but linked to this quality is a standoffishness and coldness of character. Remember to join the joie de vivre club before checking in. My partner is a member but because i was paying they would not give me the points. a bit unfair.go to the baghdad cafe in the castro if you want real food."
147,2099,"Mar 17 2007 	Love it!	The Vitale is a chic hotel that offers a luxurious, unique and pleasant stay. It truly caters to all of your senses with fresh lavender scent in the rooms and hallways, textured walls and special lighting. Its super relaxing. The bedrooms are very modern, comfortable and clean, decorated in light blues and warm beige. The beds and pillows are fluffy and cozy, you can definitely get a good nights sleep. The bathroom, with large marble tiles is spacious and extremely well equipped with a nice size shower stall. In the bathrooms they provide toiletry products from Fresh, which just adds on to that spa feeling. Its a great location near the bay. Youre walking distance to all the fine restaurants, cafes, shops and not too far from Fishermans Warf. Its great for business travelers and tourist. I highly recommend this to anyone."
148,2099,"Mar 14 2007 	Great hotel wonderful atmosphere	The zen-like atmosphere was very relaxing and the location absolutely perfect! Right across the street from the busy marketplace, where you can find anything and everything to eat or drink. Also convenient to the Sausalito ferry. Be sure to take in the market on Tuesdays or Saturdays when local farms bring in their items.The hotel staff was all very professional and helpful. Everyone wore a smile. The hotel bar and restaurant was really busy on Friday night with a major singles scene. The rest of our stay the hotel bar (Americana) was more subdued and more pleasant. Try their pomagranate martini--it was fantastic!!! They have a great outdoor patio with heat lamps for those cool evenings. We ate only one breakfast in the hotel restaurant but it was quite good and well presented. I had one of the best massages I've ever had in the spa. I'm pretty picky when it comes to massages and somewhat leary of hotel spas but this one was unbelievable! Very clean and very professional. They also advertise soaking tubs but we never had a chance to try them. You might want to check those out.I would definitely recommend this hotel for those that like to get away from the very large, very corporate-type hotels and prefer a more &quot;boutique&quot; style hotel. PS. The rooms are small and our view from the 3rd floor was disappointing but I'm sure you can ask for a larger, better view."
149,2099,Mar 13 2007	Bad Valet Service - they scratched my car	The rooms were nice. But the valet service was poor. They caused a 1 meter scratch on my passenger side door. I called them and they kept re-routing me to the different people who ended up doing nothing for the car. I would never stay there again.
150,2099,"Mar 6 2007 	Such a beautiful hotel!	I stayed at the Vitale for less than 24 hours, but left hoping I could stay longer. The front desk agent was so kind after finding out it took me almost 15 hrs to get to San Fran from NY because of bad weather. They put me in a beautiful Bridge view room that was bigger than I expected. They had great lounge music quietly playing as I walked in the room and some delicious chocolates and a water for me. I loved that they had all FRESH brand toiletries and my bed was so unbelievably comfortable. Robes, slippers and dinner was all I wanted, and that's what I got. The food from room service was GREAT! Get the pasta bolognese, amazing. It looked as if they had a pretty lively bar area downstairs, I wish I had enough energy to head down there, but my bed was calling me."
151,2099,"Feb 23 2007 	Fun hotel professional staff	My husband and I stayed at the Vitale over President's Day weekend for my birthday. I had mentioned that it was my birthday when I confirmed our reservation in hopes that all would go well with our booking. Room service was apparently put on notice, and they brought me a little chocolate cake w/a birthday card and a large bottle of mineral water on our first night. Nice touch. The next night at turn-down service, house keeping also brought me a birthday card. Very nice. The hotel is modern without being edgy. It is welcoming yet hip. The rooms are nice, though ours was a little small (maybe b/c I booked through expedia?) Very pleasant decor of pale blues and greens. Excellent &quot;fresh&quot; bath products. Enough work space at the desk, if need be. I liked the lounge chair by the window, cozy. The staff was completely professional from housekeeping to the concierge. All were very nice and helpful, even on that very busy weekend. The location is excellent - right across the street from the Ferry Building, within walking distance to some of the best SF restaurants, and a couple of blocks from the BART station."
152,2099,"Feb 18 2007 	If I too can live in a hotel.	Wow. Let me begin by saying that I expected it to be good, but not as good as it turned out to be. I was so very, happily surprised.I booked a king waterview suite which acutally had a better view of the Bay Bridge and some water. Valet were professional and nice. Check in was quick, actually, we checked in at 7pm on a saturday night. Anna at front desk, was nice. Americano was happening with corporate types and hipsters.The room. Wow. I mentioned on online reservations it would be an anniversary weekend for my boyfriend and I. They placed rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bedand a complimentary bottle of champagne in an ice bucket with two champagne flutes on the table, a 'happy anniversary' card, and a cd playing electronica (the more relaxing kind) on the beautifully lit bedisde table. Didn't cost me extra. It was all complimentary. We loved it. What an awesome staff.We had dinner reservations at Foreign Cinema, so we asked if they could call us a taxi. Actually, there is a shuttle car on site. It cost us $20 excluding tip. Better to take a cab if you want to save some cash, or are not going on a date. But in our case, we were on a date so we went with the Lincoln shuttle car instead.When we came back from dinner, we were actually still quite hungry. (Though tasty, yes, Foreign Cinema serves small portions).So we went downstairs to Americano. Unfortuantely they stop serving food at 11pm. The barback, Louie is a really cool person. We took our drinks outside on a small table near the heating lamp and enjoyed the ambiance on Embarcadero and the water.After that, we returned to our room at about 1 am, still a little hungry. Apparently, guests were ordering Pizza as there was a pizza delivery man going back and fourth from floor to floor delivering food.We're glad we ordered from Cable Car Pizza. Pretty darn good food for delivering at 1am. Good tiramisu too.We drank champagne, even in our beautiful rainfall shower, lol.I don't find this negative, but you can hear people in the halls. Muffled though. I even heard a sneeze. I didn't care, but what if they heard us? Oh well. lol!The Sugar Fresh products are so good. Smells light and lemony.I love love love the pillows! I will be calling the hotel to see what kind they are so I can buy a few!In the morning, Discovery Channel was taping a bike race outside our window on Embarcadero. We watched most of it while getting ready for the day. People were crowded around, taking pictures of the bikers and getting autographs. A cool thing to see.It was check out time, unfortunately. Anna, at front desk, offered to hold my bags til I got back from shopping around the city, even though I was already checked out. I still was able to leave my car with valet til 5pm too, not a problem.I will definitely be back. Definitely! Great staff, chic, modern relaxing decor, great services, great view! Loved the place from start to finish."
153,2099,"Feb 13 2007 	A fantastic hotel that you wont want to leave...	I spent a night here is September 2006. And it was a complete joy. We didn't have a view we had a wall, but we hadn't asked for one. The hotel was clean smart and funky. The room was big with a lovely bathroom continuing Fresh! Toiletries. Although I have noted some negative reviews on here about staff, I found them beyond helpful, just generally made us feel great making the service second to none. The bar is lively with what looked like a post work crowd and I liked that, it didn't feel like a traditional hotel bar. The situation on the quay by the lovely stores and restaurants was a real treat and being opposite the wonderful Boulevard gave the hotel what distance wise was pretty much a second dining option. If your looking for traditional glamour, in an old school Nob Hill hotel no this isn't for you. But if your looking for a boutique hotel with all the service of a 5star resort and very reasonable rates, you wont be disappointed. I would stay there again and again and look forward to my trip back.I stayed at the Lambourne for 4 nights prior to my stay at Vitale and was without doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I see that its no longer on the site? One can only hope the depressed staff got the help they needed and someone decided to put them out of their misery."
154,2099,"Feb 11 2007	Central and trendy. Great place to stay	Really cool contemporary design, excellent location. The service is a bit snoby.What modern hotels should be"
155,2099,"Feb 10 2007	Hotel Vitale	We found the Hotel Vitale wonderful. We had a corner room that was architecturally very modern and interesting with curved walls and nice windows. Our room looked out onto an SF street scene which was perfect. The tub was huge and the bathroom was decadent. We didn't eat at the hotel, but we walked to Rubicon which was wonderful. This is a great hotel in a great location but it is quite modern so be forewarned."
156,2099,"Jan 25 2007	If I could live in a hotel ...	We stayed at the Hotel Vitale for a special occasion and booked two different suites for our group. The family suite was roomy with a very comfortable king bed and comfy fold-out sofa in the living room area. I liked the gauzy curtains you could pull to separate the &quot;rooms.&quot; The bathroom was fantastic with lovely complimentary toiletries, and you could also purchase special bath products. Deep soaking tub was a dream. We had a lovely view of the bay and the Ferry Plaza, it was fun to watch the bustle of the farmer's market from above. Service was very attentive, we felt welcomed with the warm washcloths at check-in and the staff treated our birthday celebration very generously with a bottle of champagne in both rooms and personal notes from the manager. Room service breakfast was tasty and timely. When I booked the reservations for our special occasion I received very good service, thoughtful and thorough, not rushed through my decisions.The bar scene in the evening was quite happening with a great wine selection and tasty cocktails. I loved the decor. The lobby and rooms were beautifully decorated, eco-modern but warm and relaxing. I could be happy living in this hotel for an extended time, if only the bank account would allow it!"
157,2099,"Jan 21 2007 	Hotel Vitale - Pinch me! I must have been dreaming ...	Enjoyed a weekend at the Vitale this past December. It was everything I expected and more ... restful, gorgeous views of the bay, perhaps the best bed ever, great food at its restaurant Americano, warm and friendly service throughout, a rooftop tub, and best of all -- the perfect location. We woke up Saturday morning and strolled across the street to the Ferry Building and weekly Saturday Farmers Market. There we enjoyed fresh roasted coffee, breakfast pastries and sights of all kinds of interesting products. December was amazing ... I can only imagine how wonderful this market must be in summer in fall!We stayed in and dined at the hotel restaurant Americano on Saturday evening. Despite all the great restaurants we've enjoyed in San Francisco, we were delightfully pleased at the quality of food and service encountered ... and glad we opted to dine in and enjoy an evening of romance in this hotel.All in all ... GREAT PLACE! Thank you Vitale!"
158,2099,"Jan 16 2007 	Poor First Impression	We stayed here from the 10th January for 3 nights and the last leg of our Honeymoon.We had travelled from fiji to Auckland, sat in Auckland airport all day then had a 12 hour flight to San Francisco. We breezed through US immigration and our cases were there as we approached the carousel. Outside a cab was ready to take us to the Vitale, we arrived there within an hour of touching down, to be greated by a member of staff who clearly had more important customers than us, she simply told us that our room wasn't ready and that nothing could be guarenteed before 3.00pm, it was currently 12.30.After a long journey I expected a better welcome, afterall the hotel know which flight you're on and when to expect you. For a hotel which is aspiring to great things this attitude is something fundamental which needs to be addressed. In a country which is well known for it's customer focussed service we were a bit disappointed to be greeted by this attitude.I asked if we could wait with a drink in reception, the answer was no!Luckily another staff member intervened and, although he didn't tell us anything different his manner was more acceptable. We were offered a room a the 4th floor or, an hour later, our room on the 7th floor would ready, we waited the extra hour in the bar.Room was ok, a partial bridge view although I was expecting a habour front room, it was comfortable enough and the bed linen was excellent, the room wasn't as big as I was expecting either.After a long day we opted for room service in the evening which was very good. We ate in the Americano on our last evening which was buzzing with an afterwork crowd, the restuarant too was busy, the wine list was good and the food was very good. We ate in One Market the evening before and to be honest even though it is more expensive would probably opt to eat there again rather than the Americano, there's nothing wrong with the Americano just that One Market just gave that little bit more for your Dollar.We would stay there again as the hotel, bar and restuarant are all very good lively places, it's just a shame that in the last place of our Honeymoon we were greeted by such an abrasive staff member, maybe she should look for a career which isn't customer facing."
159,2099,"Jan 10 2007 	Perfect!	Stayed at the Vitale with my husband for 5 nights over the New Year period and loved it! This was my first visit to the city and I found the location of the hotel to be perfect. It's on the Embarcadero opposite the Ferry Building, which has some great restaurants and a Farmers' Market at the weekend. We had a lovely view of the Bay Bridge from our room.For some people the location may be a little quiet as it's not as bustling as the Union Square area etc - transport is easy though. Streetcars and also the Trolley stop right by the hotel.We didn't eat at the hotel (we bought breakfast in the Ferry Building) but did use the bar several times. It's quite lively in the early evening and cocktails are fab!! The staff were all very friendly and helpful as was the concierge. We had a problem with the bathtub and that was fixed promptly. On New Year's Eve a bottle of champagne was put in everyone's room (a nice touch!!). It was also my birthday and there was a cake waiting in the room on arrival! The room we were allocated was fairly small (though this wasn't a problem for us) but the bathroom was large. Tastefully decorated and very clean. Liked the turndown service with the CDs playing when you return to room. All in all, it was a perfect stay and I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone who likes the minimalist style but with professional service. Loved San Francisco too and would recommend the nearby Slanted Door restaurant as well as Asia de Cuba at the Clift hotel."
160,2099,"Jan 9 2007	A room shared with Claudia Schiffer	My husband booked a Bay view room for my birthday. When we arrived, we started off on the wrong foot with the front desk staff who insisted we had booked a city view room. My husband, after some polite coaxing, started to get more insistent (irritated)when the personality-less staff member hit a few buttons on her screen and realized she had been in someone else with the last name reservation. Non plussed, she found our room and informed us it would be ready in an hour or so.We took a walk, and returned to find the room ready. We encountered what was not a Bay view room, but a very partial Bay view room. Not wanting to find anything wrong with what my husband had arranged, I tried to not say anything about the HUGE GAP ad of Claudia Schiffer on the opposite building's wall which leered at me. I laid on the bed, and then thought, well I could pull the curtain over her face, and only see on the left, the Bay bridge. But alas, the curtain did not pull that way.So I laid back on the bed to accept the situation, when I looked to my left and reflected in the large mirror was Claudia Schiffer.I can't do it! I proclaimed, knowing we were dropping 3 bills on the room.So we tried to get a better room, but our only other option was Claudia eye level on the floor above.So we took a walk and found ecstacy at the Mandarin Oriental and the only positive aspect of Vitale was they did not charge us for the time our car was parked through all this. Gee.The staff were clearly inexperienced as we were not so problematic and could have been appeased with the right room. What should be known about this hotel was when I did tell them about the intrusive ad (which is lit at night so don't think you can have darkness help you), they informed me &quot;Gap owns this town and they all stay here.&quot; Ouch."
161,2099,"Jan 8 2007 	Bathroom Bloopers	We stayed at the Hotel Vitale on an overnight layover, and having been to San Francisco numerous times, we like to try different hotels and picked Hotel Vitale.The staff are 20-30 somethings; overall, they very friendly, professional, and accomodating. We stayed in suite that had a view of the Bay Bridge. The room is decorated in modern minimalism, but with touches of warmth, like the cozy bed with big duvet. The bed was a bit on the soft side, but we did have a restful sleep. Extra pillows and a blanket were neatly packaged in a canvas bag, sitting on the floor. A bit odd, considering there is a huge empty shelf in the closet.Overall, the hotel promotes relaxation and serenity, and we liked the new age music and white noise cd's that were stacked beside the cd player.The room service was prompt and the food was hot, well prepared, and our meals were awesome. The choc. chip cookies and milk dessert really hit the spot. I registered for the room, and my husband has a different surname than I. He was met with extreme suspicion when he ordered for us, as the person taking our order kept questioning our differing surnames. That is perhaps why we were made to pay for our food on arrival to the room; it being late at night, we decided not to pursue the issue. We just felt badly for the room service person, who was forced to make two trips: to deliver food then to run downstairs to process our credit card payment. Something to take note of if you are travelling with someone with a different surname.Ah, now to the bathroom. The bathroom has an amazing glassed-in rainfall shower, and a handy cut-out is in the glass wall to reach in and run the shower before you get in. However, I am 5'2&quot;, and found my arm did not reach the water faucets. Therefore, my husband had to run the shower for me. A minor thing, but not very convenient if I was by myself. Also, a major thing we did not appreciate was the sliding door of the bathroom which sits about an inch above the door opening. You better be travelling with an extremely good friend or your spouse as .... every little sound carries into the room if you know what I mean. And, some things should just remain private between two people.Overall, we had a nice stay at Hotel Vitale, but would not return as the bathroom door was the deal breaker for us. If you don't care about that, the hotel is in a great location and the staff are wonderful, plus the best-tasting room service we've had yet."
162,2099,"Jan 1 2007 	Good but not 5*...	Booked this hotel for a 3 day stay over Christmas following the reviews here on Tripadvisor. We wanted something a bit more up-market than the usual motel style places we've previously stayed at in SF. The room and hotel itself didn't disappoint - very luxurious, stylish and exceptionally quiet rooms. Really liked the location - easy to get around with good access to public transport and even within walking distance of the main shopping areas.The only negative comments I have were regarding the pricing - the room itself was great value, but then they charged a fortune for extras such as breakfast and parking (eg $4.50 for an americano coffee, $49 for the valet parking) - it was only because we were there on Christmas Day and everywhere else was closed that we had to pay these prices - the rest of our trip we went elsewhere and paid much less - all within easy walking distance of the hotel. Overall, would definitely stay here again."
163,2099,Dec 27 2006 	Loved the Vitale...	This is long overdue... My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Vitale on our Honeymoon in June 2005. We stayed in a Deluxe I belive. It had a corner view with an amazing view of the Embarcidaro (spelling?) and of the Oakland bridge. I can't begin to say how awesome the hotel was. It was my first time to San Fran and I have recommended to everyone that they stay there ever since.
164,2099,"Dec 17 2006 	Quite Good	I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past six months. The rooms are very comfortable/modern: great beds, large bathrooms (with good toiletries), incredible water views (above the 4th floor). Nicer than the W and almost as luxurious as the Four Seasons. The service is generally professional; I've never used the concierge. The location cuts two ways--it's at the very end of Mission St., but that's what gives it great views, and you're across the street from the Ferry Building marketplace. Two of SF's best restaurants are within a block: Boulevard &amp; The Slanted Door. One egregious fault: $40/night for parking. Overall it's my go-to choice in SF for under $300/night."
165,2099,"Dec 5 2006 	Beautiful Hotel	We travelled to the Hotel Vitale as part of our honeymoon and really enjoyed our stay there. On arrival we found the staff friendly and when we got into our room we found a bottle of Champagne on ice, a box of chocolates and a card congratulating us. We also found that we had been upgraded to a corner room which had two floor to ceiling windows looking across the Bay Bridge and the Embarcadero. The room was lovely and relaxing with plenty of room and there was a relaxing christmas CD playing on arrival which was a nice touch. There was no bath in the bathroom however I think other rooms do have baths and there was a huge shower with lots of lovely smelling toiletries. There were complimentary yoga session on the roof every morning (I never got up in time to attend!) and the overall feel of the hotel is trendy and laid back. We ate/drank in the hotel bar on Thanksgiving day and the service and quality was excellent. Location wise I really liked the hotel but it might not be for everyone as it's in the financial district and not in the tourist end. We found it easy to walk to most places and the sightseeing buses actually drop off/pick up quite near to the hotel so that would be a good option to get around. If we could change anything I would have liked to have had tea and coffee making facilities (though there are plenty of coffee houses around) but altogether we really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Vitale."
166,2099,"Nov 26 2006 	We'll be back! Loved the Vitale!	After a lot of research, we decided to stay at the Hotel Vitale for our San Francisco trip. Let me just say, we were not disappointed. It was fantastic!We arrived from the airport around 10:00 am and they had a room for us! We had only paid for the courtyard view, but they upgraded us to a Bay View because that room was ready. It was fabulous. The view really just added to the atmosphere and I highly recommend it. The room itself was a bit small, but the space was utilized very well in my opinion. The bathroom was spacious. The tub in the room was huge. Definitely one of the best hotel tubs ever. Fresh bath products were a very nice and appreciated touch.The hotel did nightly turn down service and left bottled water and chocolates. They also turned on a nice CD. It was always a great thing to come back to.The Vitale offers a complimentary Town Car service within a mile of the hotel, which is very nice. We used it a few times. If the car is unavailable, it's still very easy to get around. Buses and street cars stop right next to the hotel and the California Street cable car is only about 2 blocks away. The location is a bit off the typical tourist path(s) of Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf, but it was not an issue for us.We travel to San Francisco at least 3 times a year and since we know our way around, being slightly removed from the &quot;main&quot; tourist drag was really a non-issue and overall, we preferred it. I highly recommend the Hotel Vitale. We will definitely stay here again."
167,2099,"Nov 24 2006 	average	Room was below average. Location is OK, far from tourist activities-if that is what you are looking for. A LOT of locals hang out at the restaurant. The price is not too bad, but I was not impressed with the decor, location, or service."
168,2099,"Nov 19 2006 	A nice San Francisco getaway	My wife went to the Hotel Vitale in September 06 for a getaway week-end and a visit with family. The hotel is a little hard to find, but not to worry if you have GPS. Otherwise, it might be best to make a map. Check in was slow, and we did make the people responsible uncomfortable by sitting and staring at them, but we had no place else to go and it was past their given time. The room was very nice, modern and clean and, if you pay a little extra, a view of the Bay Bridge. The service was all around very superior and the staff quite nice. The room comes with nice amenities and if you like them, you can buy some more at their spa. On a nice day, you can sit out on the rooftops and enjoy the view of the bay and the ferry building (which on Saturday has an excellent farmer`s market.) Not a place for children and quite expensive, but the city and it`s excellent restaurants are nearby or just a trolley ride away. We enjoyed our stay very much."
169,2099,"Nov 18 2006 	Ups and downs at Hotel Vitale	My entire family met in San Francisco for my little brother's 21st birthday. We decided on staying at Hotel Vitale since my parents had stayed there and were really treated well on a prior trip to SF. We booked four rooms for the entire weekend far in advance for the trip. The hotel is very chic and has a great atmosphere, but after checking in we realized that we were put in rooms that looked onto another fold in the building directly next to the entire air conditioning unit for the hotel. We were unsure about whether we would need an additional room for our stay and at check-in the receptionists mentioned that it would be easy to book another room. However when we asked whether any other rooms were available with a better view, we were told that the hotel was completely full. As my entire family was arriving at different times, we figured that we would check back when everyone arrived to see if the hotel was able to accomodate our request. When my parents arrived, the hotel checked them into one of the rooms we had already checked in to and noted that it would be impossible to switch any of the rooms.After finally checking into all the rooms and a little more convincing, the hotel was able to locate nicer rooms for our stay. Despite the hassle, it was nice to switch rooms. All in all, the hotel is very nice, with a pretty hip bar connected to the lobby. The hotel is in perfect location to check out the Ferry building, walk to Union Square, or explore Chinatown. The rooms are nice and the beds are extremely comfortable. Additionally, the hotel has a very relaxed feeling and the staff is extremely polite. Without the headache upon check in my entire family enjoyed the stay. The only other issue was the bellman's insistance that we take a hotel car instead of hailing a cab. We needed two cabs and we only going about 10 blocks, but the bellman seemed hesitant to hailing a cab with the sedans parked in the entrance way. The best offer the cars could manage was $20 per car. After hailing our own cabs, the fare was $6. There seemed to be some collusion between the hotel and the car company. Hotel Vitale may want to follow Le Meridien's lead of offering free hotel car service with advance notice."
170,2099,"Nov 10 2006 	The best hotel in San Francisco!	This hotel was incredible! The rooms were very modern and clean. The bathroom was spotless. The soaps and shampoos smell so great. The flatscreen TV and the CD player were awesome. And the view - we had a room facing the bay and the Bay Bridge which was outstanding. In the elevators, you hear relaxing music while watching relaxing video on a flat screen above the door. We rented a car through the consierge which was easy and efficient. The location being near the port and baseball field was the best - everything was in walking distance. We didn't have a chance to take advantage of the Sunday Yoga morning class but next time we plan on doing that."
171,2099,Oct 11 2006 	Loved the Lemon Soap :-)	This hotel is ideally situated within walking distance of every attraction. The hotel is of a very high standard and rooms are excellent.... I would recomend (and have done many times) this hotel to anyone visiting San Fran. The bar downstairs gets very busy when the everyone finishes work. The restaurant is fantastic and the food is great....
172,2099,"Oct 9 2006	Excellent!!!	Everytime I stay in a nice hotel i keep comparing it to Vitale in SF. It was really nice place to stay. Spacious room (king), nice and clean. Comfy bed and linens. Free water in the room, every night a little chocolate on your pillow - i find this as a really nice touch and attention to detail form the hotel owners. Great location, rooftop terrace with nice chairs, views of The Embarcadero and Oakland bridge....simply great stay. Can't wait to stay there again!"
173,2099,"Oct 9 2006 	Overdelivers!	It was our 5th wedding anniversary and my Husband surprised me by booking a room at Hotel Vitale for the weekend. He mentioned the occasion when he booked the room and when we checked in (room 622) we had a bottle of champagne in our room - along with a note wishing us a Happy Anniversary!Everyone on the staff is very professional and accomadating. When we checked out at noon I saw some people checking in and even though check in isn't until 3 pm, they accomdated everyone. The room is calming, very quiet, and luxurious. The room is also quite spacious and you can see the attention to detail throughout. We had a &quot;city view room&quot; but it had a nice view of the Bay Bridge and water. The sheets on the bed have to be close to 1,000 thread count, and the mattress is very comfortable. We used to live in SF, and the area the hotel is in has to be my favorite because you are right on the Embarcadero which is parallel to the water and great for walking or running. You are also a short walk from the Ferry Building, shops at Embarcardero, and great restaurants.This hotel has really thought of everything and it shows. They have an in room CD player...along with great CD's that we enjoyed throughout the weekend. They also have wonderful robes and slippers you can take home with you.We did the couples bath ritual in the hotel spa ($60 per person). They have outdoor bathtubs, and it was neat to soak on top of a hotel in downtown SF.We went to dinner at Restaurant Bix (15 minute walk) and it was EXCELLENT. We have high standards because we are spoiled by SF restaurants and it exceeded our expectations. When we got back to the room the turn down service had come and sprinkled rose petals all over our bed! The maid had also turned on a CD. Again, my Husband didn't request this...they just did it. The next morning we had brunch in the Americano (hotel restaurant). The food was great. At night the Amercicano turns into a major hot spot. I went recently on a Friday night for happy hour and there was an hour wait to get in. They have a great outdoor patio with comfortable chairs and bamboo plants that is right on the Embarcadero...so great for people watching.The hotel has a relationship with the YMCA and Bay Club which are both very close. It's free to workout at the Y so we did that. It's actually a very nice Y, and half a block away. Working out at the Bay Club will cost you $10. The hotel has complimentary yoga classes each morning.We will recommend this to everyone and look forward to staying again!"
174,2099,"Oct 3 2006 	Sunday Night Locals Special - Great Deal and Great Property!	Last weekend, my husband and I spent Sunday night at the Hotel Vitale to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The experience was nearly perfect in every way. I definitely recommend this property!Our room was a &quot;Partial Ocean View&quot; room for $219+tax for one night, parking included. This was at least a 30% discount off posted rates. Definitely a terrific price for the overnight, close-to-home get away we had in mind.The room itself (Room 449) was well-appointed, spacious (unlike a lot of other hotels in the area), and the view was pretty good. We could see the ferry building and part of the bay and enjoyed lounging on the chaise and looking out the window.I really enjoyed the little touches like the VERY nice products in larger size containers, extra cushy robe and slippers, and the flat screen tv located the perfect viewing distance from the bed.We went to the Spa on Monday and did the &quot;Go and Glow&quot; special, $85 for 50 minutes. Also a good deal - also very worth it. I've been to a lot of spas, but haven't had an experience quite like the outdoor, rooftop soaking tubs! Definitely recommend that.My only (minor) complaint is over the prices of the room service and the fact that there is no in-room coffee service. So if you're a coffee-head, pack your own setup or get ready to trek to Peet's at the Ferry Building. $18++ for a room service pot is definitely not worth it!"
175,2099,Sep 15 2006 	Great	Stayed at Hotel Vitale for one night this month with my mother. We thought it was absolutely great. We arrived very early (at around 11 a.m.) and they gave us a room very promptly despite our premature arrival. Beds were very comfortable and the location was perfect. Bar downstairs was perfect for an evening cocktail to enjoy the lovely weather. Will definitely return.
176,2099,"Sep 13 2006 	Hotel Vitale is Fabulous	We stayed at the Hotel Vitale for three nights for my husband's birthday. I noted the occasion when making the online reservation and we were greeted with a bottle of champagne, chocolate cake and a handwritten birthday note in our room when we arrived. The room offered a beautiful view of the bay bridge. The design of the hotel and rooms is clean, soft and modern with high quality furnishings, Fresh bath products, flat screen TV, etc. The service was exceptional. The location was excellent. One of the best hotel experiences we've ever had."
177,2099,"Aug 31 2006 	Hotel Vitale is a winner!!!	While I live in SoCal now, I am a NorCal native and long-time resident. My partner and I decided to stay in the city for her birthday, and I wanted to find a hotel that wasn't the standard cookie-cutter major-chain type (although I am a rewards member of many). I don't even remember how I landed on the Hotel Vitale site, but I was instantly hooked. Reason: The Ferry Building. If you are a foodie, you KNOW already you're going to SF, you KNOW where you want to be on a Saturday morning, and this hotel is right across the street, poised in perfect striking distance. So I browsed the site, and was amazed that this little hidden gem was to be found. I booked one of the better rooms with a TERRIFIC view (room 606) and spa shower, and took the plunge with an open mind and high hopes.The Hotel Vitale did not disappoint. From the moment we got there, the modern elegance of the property was wonderful. My partner was a little recalcitrant at first (as she put it, she could not think of a hotel that, on first sight, was LESS &quot;her type&quot;) but when we got to the room... I had advised the hotel that it was my partner's birthday. When we got in (very late Fri night), there awaited a bottle of champagne on ice...and not Cook's or something cheap, either! It was a very impressive bottle of Chandon Brut. accompanied by a personalized card for me from the manager, as well as a personalized card for my partner (from the housekeeping staff at turndown). We were worried about the minbar, because we intended to purchase food at the farmer's market/Ferry Building on Sat, and nosh on it throughout the weekend. Not to worry -- the minibar was NOT one of those electronic-sensor ones that charges your room if you just breathe on something...we were able to remove items to make room for our purchases, and then replace them when we were done. Housekeeping seemed to dig this immediately, as nothing was moved or touched in that regard. We ended up purchasing a lot of nibbles at the farmer's market/ ferry building, and spent one night watching in-room movies while having a luxurious feast in a room that did it justice. These superior rooms do have a closet type armoire with a couple of drawers, as well as a small curtained off area for the ironing board and iron. The closet included two robes, and two COMPLIMENTARY pairs of slippers. Our bellman quickly rustled up two additional suitcase racks and set them up, so space was not a problem. The window-seat couch had a cashmere throw, and the bedding --- well, it was the best sleep of our lives, and I didn't want to leave... We received a card inviting us to a free yoga session if we so desired. There are complimentary &quot;Fresh&quot; toiletries as well as overpriced 'honor bar' ones, which didn't impress us enough to try them. The in-room honor bar also includes Dean &amp; Deluca treats, Scharffenberger chocolates, airplane booze, etc., and a clever &quot;intimacy kit&quot; package of *ahem* items in case you forgot something... They will give you either the NY Times, SF Chronicle or both, if you just ask. The papers arrive in a clever canvas sack hanging on your door daily. If you're worried about clanging maid carts or ice machines, forget it. This hotel is very retro euro-styled, in that you call down to the front desk for ice. The hotel is QUIET. We were overlooking the Embarcadero, right over the outdoor bar area, and noise never bothered us even late-night. We WERE able to open our windows to some degree.The concierge was wonderful. If you ask, he will give you a canvas hotel logo shopping bag for your purchases at the ferry building. Something people haven't mentioned -- go around the back corner from the hotel bar, and you're at an F-line trolley stop, which gets you on board before the huddled masses at the Embarcadero/Ferry building sites. So if you are using the F-line, it is literally door-to-door service, you need to walk maybe 1/2 block. We did not dine at Americano, but enjoyed several drinks outdoors. We did not use the spa, but the rooftop space looks wonderful. This hotel is not by any real means kid-friendly in and of itself, but they do have a nice kid's program for family travelers called &quot;Kids are VIP&quot;, where the child will have a personalized ID card on a lanyard given to him/her on check-in, and the child is the one who handles all the check-in procedures, and they will make a kid feel special and important. I think the ONLY con about this hotel is that there are no bathtubs in the super-deluxe view rooms (you have to go to the highest-end room for that). I am a shower fiend (and the spa shower is GREAT but can be slippery after product use-- they do not have stall mats) and was quite happy with the rainforest-style shower.Would I go again? Already booked for a convention next year!"
178,2099,"Aug 28 2006 	Great Hotel for the Bachelorette Party!	I stayed at Hotel Vitale for a bachelorette weekend and it was wonderful. The service, decor and beds were awesome. The staff was at our beckon call and we loved sleeping in the beds!! The hotel was kind enough to give us a bottle of champagne and a tray of gourmet cupcakes for the group which was super sweet. We loved the rooftop terrace (what a view!) and overall the hotel was great. Overnight parking was $$ at $40/night but that was my only complaint....we went to the bar in the hotel and had a lot of fun there as well. Next time I go to this hotel, I am going to do a more romantic trip as the hotel is good for both scenarios...great stay overall. Thanks Hotel Vitale! (more specifically Nicole Muller)"
179,2099,"Aug 22 2006 	Very Good Experience	My wife and I stayed in room 455 (superior water view room) at the Vitale for five nights in August of 2006. This was our first trip to SF. We are both 48 years young and live in Denver. Overall we had a very good experience at the Vitale.Plusses -The hotel was very quiet. There were rare execeptions, such as the reving of a motorcycle on the Embarcadero at midnight, or a room service cart being tipped-over, but these exceptions were very few and far between. The rooms on either side of us were occupied during our stay, and we never heard any noise from our neighbors. We never heard any &quot;normal&quot; traffic from the Embarcadero (or Market or Mission streets).Being new, the hotel was also very clean.As most reviewers have noted, the beds are extremely comfortable.The room thermostat worked efficiently.The computer room on the second floor had three computers, all of which were connected to a printer. VERY fast internet connection. I visited the computer room several times and there was always at least one available machine.Maid service seemed to visit the room twice per day.LOCATION! We loved the location on the Embarcadero. The Ferry Building is right across the street, and many restaurants are also within a block or two. TIP: for those wanting a cheap but good breakfast, there is a food court in the office building directly south of the hotel, across Steuart Street. We ate breakfast at Yes Burger and Malts (yes (no pun), they serve breakfast until 10:30am). However, this food court is closed on the weekend. Another Tip: some of the restaurants in this area, and in the Financial District, are closed on Sunday. Plan accordingly.The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful.The hotel offers a limo service to SFO for $45. Our taxi ride from SFO was $42. Question: do they offer this limo service from SFO to the hotel? This might be a good question to ask before arriving, as the limo was obviously much more comfortable than the taxi, for about the same price.The view from our room was as advertised: the Bay Bridge, the bay, and the Ferry Building were all right there. The Bay Bridge, lit at night, was quite nice. I did not want to close the drapes at night. That being said, the drapes when closed do block out all light.There are plenty of electical outlets just above the desk. Very handy for cell phone chargers and laptops.Minuses - As previous reviewers have noted, there are no dressers or other drawers in the room. Only a closet (approx 3-feet wide), but with plenty of hangers. (There is a small drawer below the closet.) One must definitely live out of one's suitcase.Other comments - The roof-top areas at this hotel are amazing. I did not see too many guests using it, and we under-utilized it. Besides tables and chairs, they have propane heating devices on the roof areas to keep one warm and, as above, the views are quite nice. I suspect a hotel employee would be best to start one of the propane heaters. I wish we had taken advantage and used the roof more, and the heaters at least once.The windows in the rooms cannot be opened.The mini-bar and sale of toiletries have been comment on by other reviewers. While silly and overpriced, this was a non-issue to us. We never opened the mini-bar.The plasma TV was quite nice. Besides the usual local channels, ESPN, CNN, Fox, USA, TBS, TNT, etc, there were pay-per-view movies available, including first-run and adult themes....&quot;Free&quot; tolitries included the standard shampoo, lotion, etc. There was a hair dryer in the bathroom (located in a bag underneath the sink).Check-out time is noon. We asked for and received a 1:00 check out.We did not visit the Americano Restaurant. On weekday evenings it seemed to be very crowded. I have read and heard they do good business from the fincancial district crowd after work days. This seems to be true.The chimes on the Ferry Building clock tower begin ringing at 8:00am, and every thirty minutes thereafter.I understand there is complimentary coffee in the lobby at certain times, but I did not even bother. Each morning I walked across the street to the Ferry Building and went to Peet's Coffee. This short walk was also very enjoyable; seeing the city come to life. The aforementioned food court also has several places to buy coffee.This is a pricey hotel, but the plusses, especially the location, make it worth the price, in our opinion. We noted hordes of tourists in the Union Square and Wharf areas. To not have to deal constantly with these crowds seems to be worth any premium.We enjoyed out stay and would gladly return to the Vitale."
180,2099,"Aug 6 2006 	Form and Function and function loses	Not bad, but not geat either.I basically agree with the post from 8/2, but I reach a different conclusion: the hotel definately is a cut above the norm, but its just not practical.Theres no coffee in the room, for example, and the coffee in the lobby was out 3 of the 5 times i wanted a cup (between 7 and 8).The ice bucket is edgy, but about one third the size of the normal plastic one you get everywhere else. For this price, the place should have a frige and not require us to empty the honor bar to store milk and water (in addition to the lack of coffee, theres also no continental breakfast).On the positive side, the location is great. While its not AT anything, its close to everything. All of San Franciscos transportation (BART, streetcar, cablecars, and buses -- good luck figuring it out!) come together at Market and Embarcad.ero, so is very easy to get anywhere. We didn't rent a car, and that seemed to be the right decision -- getting around on public transit was easy and fun.The room itself ws OK; not quite as nice as the virtual tour on the web, but not materially diferent either."
181,2099,"Aug 2 2006 	Feng Shui meets modern Danish	Oddly, this hotel pulls off a curious mixture of new age, feng shui and modern Danish. The hotel manages to incorporate minimalism with maximum comfort (the beds were fantastic). Early morning yoga classes and flat screen TVs in the elevator with nature images (and earth music) enforced this unique experience. We stayed on the second floor and had to strain to hear any street noise. We loved the rooftop garden, which encompasses several floors connected by stairs and was great exploring with a three and a half year old. We played I-Spy from the rooftop while picking points along the Embarcadero.what a view! The staff was wonderful and the location ideal. There was easy access to all public transportation. You can catch a cable car to China Town within a five minute walk; street cars and the Muni are even closer. Yank Sing, possibly the best dim sum restaurant in San Francisco, is across the street in the Rincon Center. The Ferry building, across the street on the Embarcadero, sells three day Muni passes (a great deal for $18.00, especially if you plan to explore!). These passes are good for street cars, cable cars and the Muni, but you will need to purchase your BART tickets separately. We visit San Francisco about every 8 months or so and have stayed at the Clift Hotel, Galleria Park Hotel and the Argent. From now on, this will be my first pick."

Loved everything about the room - the comfy bed, plasma TV, towels, seating/lounge area. And tiny touches like the ambient music playing when I entered the room, and the Fresh toilettries provided. Great location. Highly recommend. Note: I had a corporate rate of $220 so this was good value."
183,2099,"Jul 25 2006 	Wonderful place to celebrate.	We spent 2 nights at the Vitale for my sweetie's birthday. We had a deluxe water view room the first night, and moved to one of the circular suites the next. Both rooms were beautiful and comfortable (and surprisingly quiet considering they overlook the Embarcadero) with great views and lots of amenities. When making the reservation, I mentioned to the hotel that this was a very special birthday celebration. They delivered free of charge, a bottle of champagne, plus a small Scharfenberger cake and birthday card to our room both nights. What a nice surprise! The staff was very friendly, attentive, and responsive. Pricey, yes, but for those special occasions, well worth it when compared with other high end places in SF. We felt very pampered and well taken care of. The only complaint I have is about the service at the Americano cafe in the hotel. We went there for breakfast and the food was very good, but service was slow and indifferent - a big change from the hotel staff. We decided not to go back since there are so many great restaurants in walking distance from the hotel. We had a great time at the Vitale and will definitely go back next time we have a special occasion to celebrate."
184,2099,"Jul 18 2006	Pampered but paid for it	The location of the Vitale and the quality of service was excellent. While the staff was young, they were helpful, energetic and plentiful.We needed some peace and quiet and sleep (and escape from the Cenral Valley heat) in luxurious surroundings and found it. We had a circular room on the 5th floor and enjoyed the view of the bay and the Bay Bridge both during the day and at night. Waking up to the view (assuming you had the remote control, electric blinds open) was a treat. Weather was SF classic.The rooms are contemporary but comfortable--we both slept well. The perks like Bose CD player and Ipod dock (Bose), flat screen TV (with HD), rainforest shower head are super.Room service was very good and prompt and brunch at the restaurant was good. Plenty of food at Ferry Building across the street as well. Apparently, hotel restaurant is real hang out on Friday nights but settled down at reasonable hour.I agree with other comments. While their room service coffee is very good, I would prefer the convenience and savings of in room coffee.I also agree, a little too much marketing given the room rate--bath amenities, room service coffee, etc.However, a wonderfully relaxing and comforable weekend with attentive staff.The onlty question regarding this hotel is your subjective opinion of value. We paid a hefty price for 2 nights in the circular room. But for us on this particular weekend it was worth it. Whether that would be the case next time is uncertain."
185,2099,"Jul 18 2006	Looking forward to our next stay at Hotel Vitale	My fiance and I stayed at Hotel Vitale for the first 3 nights of a 7-night vacation in December 2005. I chose Vitale after reading reviews and getting personal recommendations from other Trip Advisor members. For those planning a trip ANYWHERE, remember that there are &quot;Local Experts&quot; available on the forums who can give you personalized recommendations based on what type of trip you are going on, be it a business trip, shopping adventure, romantic get-away or family vacation. My needs and wants may not be the same as yours so use this website to it's fullest extent! That said, here is a rundown of our vacation:We arrived at Vitale in one piece after a hair-raising shuttle van ride from the airport and were greeted warmly by the bellman, Stephen. He took care of our numerous HEAVY suitcases while we made our way to the front desk. The check-in process went smoothly and everyone was very polite and attentive.Stephen escorted us to our room on the fourth floor. I neglected to write down the room number (411 maybe?) but as you exit the elevators, it is right in front of you to the right of the corner room. It was a &quot;partial water view&quot; facing Mission St. One of the first things you notice upon exiting the elevators is the fresh lemony smell. As another reviewer mentioned, it does not have the usual &quot;hotel smell&quot; and the entire hotel is non-smoking. Stephen brought our luggage in and showed us around the room. At first glance we felt it was a rather small room but when you consider the premium on space in SF I would guess that it was average sized. It actually came to feel very cozy when we would come back from a long day of sightseeing. And after all, it's not like we were spending much time in the room! A reviewer from a while back commented on the lack of storage space and I was afraid that might be an issue but we found the corner closet and the wardrobe with a deep drawer underneath to be more than adequate for 3 days worth of clothing for 2. As most everyone has said, the bed was fabulously comfortable. The flat screen TV mounted on the wall keeps from using up precious space. At first I was disappointed that &quot;partial water view&quot; means that if you look straight out the window you DO NOT see water. However, when lying in bed or lounging on the chaise by the window, you have a great view of the Bay Bridge. I spent an hour or so just sitting there watching the traffic on the bridge and even spent a rainy afternoon writing out Christmas cards while looking out at the Bay. The bathroom was nicely appointed but again is not enormous. We would have liked to peek into a room with a &quot;rainforest shower&quot; to see if they are bigger but never did ask. The complimentary soap and shampoo are lemony and are so good that I stashed each day's refills in my bag for future travels. I was tempted to try the additional items offered for sale but they were too pricey for me. The nightstands are cool and you get a CD player/alarm clock combo. At turndown housekeeping put on a mellow, jazzy Christmas CD that we enjoyed returning to. Other nice touches are the complimentary slippers that you get to take home to remember your stay, decadent bathrobes (sorry they are not free but are available for purchase) and bottles of water and a weather forecast left at turndown. Another small but appreciated touch was a light in the shower. Some showers feel so dark!Every time we passed through the lobby, Stephen greeted us warmly by name, making us feel like true guests instead of just a number. The hotel has a courtesy car which will bring you anywhere within a mile of the hotel but be aware that you must find your own way back. Oh, and the Vitale's driver is NOT your typical SF driver! He was courteous and drove sanely. We left for dinner one rainy evening and the valet gave us loaner umbrellas. Be sure to check out the rooftop patio areas both during the day and at night. Unfortunately for us, a front passed through while we were there so it was too cool and windy to stay out there for long. There is also a small business center on the second floor where you can get on the internet. Back to the public transportation issue, the F-line trolley stop (takes you to Fisherman's Wharf) is just behind Vitale and the BART station is a short walk up Market so you can get just about anywhere once you know the routes. Being from a small Southern town we were not familiar with public transportation but a friendly native gave us the basics.We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, choosing instead to try some of the &quot;Bests&quot; while in SF. Check out my reviews of Yank Sing, Scoma's and John's Grill for details of these amazing establishments! We did the obligatory Alcatraz tour which was pretty cool and spent a bit of time browsing the shops at Pier 39. For us, the location was superb. After seeing the Fisherman's Wharf area, I'm glad we decided not to stay there. It may be close to the action but it was just too &quot;touristy&quot;. Since our travel goal was sightseeing and not shopping we had no desire to go to Union Square. The only negatives I can think of are, as mentioned by other guests, no in-room coffeemaker (and the coffee in the lobby goes fast!) and the high valet fee. We rented a car Sat evening to drive to Tahoe Sunday and had to park it overnight. Again, I know there is a lack of space in SF so even parking is a premium but $46 per night seems extremely high. The only other problem was that Vitale set such a high standard that the hotels in Tahoe and Reno seemed like dumps by comparison! We would like to visit SF again one summer and cant imagine staying anywhere else but Hotel Vitale!"
