194,1258,"Jul 2 2007 	Loved the Park Lane	I quite recently stayed at the Parklane Hotel for 1 week. My experience was excellent. The hotel staff couldn't do enough for me. The location was perfect, it was in walking distance of all main attractions. We had several meals at the hotel, including high tea. The food and service was fabulous. I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone who was travelling to London. Debbie in Ontario, Canada"
195,1258,"Jun 29 2007 	These Reviews are all wrong Park Lane was Lovely.	After reading the reviews I was scared about what to expect from this hotel. Well I thought it was wonderful. We stayed at the preferred level due to my starpoints. We had a beautiful suite, with a great view of Big Ben and the London Eye. The staff was lovely. We had an afternoon tea and breakfast in the hotel both were great. The conceirage was very helpful. The hotel has an old charm. Like I said in the beginning I am very shocked at the harsh reviews of this hotel . I typically stay in only the best hotels and this hotel was lovely. I can not complain about it."
196,1258,"Jun 25 2007 	Had a great time at The Park Lane Sheraton Hotel	I got this hotel through Priceline.com and was worried after reading all the terrible reviews. We stayed May 27-30 2007.Surprisingly enough...we had a great time there. The room was great for London if not new and the service was always polite and helpful. The bathroom was clean and so was the room. I really can't think of one bad thing to say of the place.It was also very close to Green Park tube station which is very convenient.We payed with AMEX and maybe that's why we got a really good room, but I'm not sure (American express has some dort of affiliation with Sheraton Hotels).All in all a good experience."
197,1258,"Jun 20 2007 	Awful Experience	Upon arrival, I was placed in a smoke-filled non-smoking room. The room had been cleaned, so the hotel had to be aware and placed me in the room anyway. I guess hoping that I would not need to inhale while there.I requested a move and landed in the room with the creature. Yes, a portable air conditioner with a huge tube tail that had to be placed out the window during operation. The first night, I awoke in a sweat, and found the creature's tail was dismembered, leaving the creature in a puddle of it's own excretions.Next, I attempted to approach the shower in the hole, where the bathtub extended behind the lavoratory wall.The floor and walls were sadly dirty and stained.To top it all off, when leaving the hotel one day early, I was told I had to pay a full extra night's fee because I left early. Imagine that.Sheraton should strip their name from this sad little nightmare on Picadilly Lane.Please see photo of the creature below."
198,1258,"Jun 14 2007 	Worst Hotel Room I have ever stayed in!	We booked a London Five Star Hotel with Last Minute.com for a soecial price of 100 per night and were allocated the Park Lane Sheraton Hotel in Piccadilly. On entering the Hotel we were impressed with the Art Deco Public rooms and Foyer. However on entering our room we promptly crashed back down to no better than back street doss house accommodation. The carpet was stained, cracked and missing tiles in the bathroom, drawers with no handles on them and walls that had not seen paint since probably the Art Deco period. The window looked onto an internal enclosed void with accompanying din from air con units etc. On the good side the bed sheets looked clean but we did not dare look at the mattress in case it matched the room decor and put us off sleeping in it.On complaining to the receptionist, who spoke little English, I was met with no sympathy at all and reminded that we were on a special deal after all!I later complained to LastMinute.com who initially refused any responsibility and passed my complaint on to the Hotel. I reminded tLastMinute that I had paid them the 100 and that I was therefore entitled to satisfaction from them. They made some feeble excuses about the Hotel not replying back to them about my complaint and credited me with 50 on my credit card."
199,1258,"Jun 8 2007	Great Hotel for Point Rewards Stay	First and foremost, please note that I stayed at this property on Starwood Reward Points and, therefore, did not price shop London hotels prior to the stay. Thus, please don't view this evaluation as a comment on relative value compared to other luxury properties in London.The hotel is located in a beautiful area across from Hyde Park and with walking distance to Piccadilly Circus and the West End Theatre District. It also has very convenient Tube access (and, with rolling luggage, you can take the tube from Heathrow to the hotel). The area also hosts some nice breakfast spots (if you are converting from USD, plan on spending about $40 for a decent breakfast for 2!).The front desk staff was quite nice and on par for a hotel of this quality level. Upon request, I was upgraded to a junior suite with no hassle.The lobby was objectively beautiful. It appears to be a business hotel, but the property maintains a romantic feel. There is a large and quite fancy bar/sitting area directly past the front entrance of the hotel. The drink prices are steep.The room that I was provided was great. The bathroom was enormous and lovely, with a steam-driven towel warmer and a strong shower.The sleeping chamber was, likewise, quite large and comfortable: very nice furnishings and large bed. With the windows closed, my room, which was facing the street, was quiet and peaceful. The suite contained a study that was adequate to serve as a second bedroom for a short stay, with a cot or the pull-out sofa-bed.If booking a rewards stay, this hotel is a winner."
200,1258,"Jun 2 2007 	Great location but...	Stayed at Park Lane Hotel 31 May and 1 June 2007. It was a little odd to arrive at the rear of the hotel but there are attractive art deco features. A highlight is the Palm Court, which is worth a visit although food/drinks expensive. We were informed by reception we had been allocated a lovely room on the first floor. Yes, the king sized bed was lovely but it was too big for the room. The room was an odd shape - the TV was located on a unit to the side of the bed and the interior of the wardrobe looked like cheap 1980s wallcoverings had been used - and had probably not been decorated since the 1980s. These small details now matter. There was no trouser press.The carpet was stained. The dresser had a label on one of the drawers saying &quot;hairdryer&quot;. The air conditioning had no instructions and when we phoned for instructions to get some heat, an old fashioned convector heater was brought to the room - extraordinary. The TV was old. The bathroom was very spacious and well equiped if a little old fashioned, and the public area around first floor level was distinctly tired. The lighting in the room was eccentric.The cooked breakfast was steep at 21 - the service was excellent - but, again, the decoration was tired.The location of the hotel is excellent - a redeeeming feature, but the hotel needs a complete overhaul."
201,1258,"May 30 2007 	Nice staff poor food dirty rooms	As an SPG member I get to stay in quite a few Sheratons around the world. This was one of the most poorly maintained Starwood properties I've come across in the past 11 years. While you get all the standard Sheraton benefits, such as a clean bed and helpful staff, the rooms and the hotel itself are just in a very poor condition, not for the lack of cleaning, but for a dire need of a revamp. It appears the rooms weren't repaired in quite a number of years. Dirty spotty worn out carpets, layers and layers of chipping paint in the corners, cracked floor moldings, a stale smell out the rickety sounding A/C and heating system. I was quite surprised to not only observe mouse droppings in the hallway, but also fleeing rodents after helping themselves to the room service leftovers set outside room doors for collection. And... wait for it... bed bugs, my first ever!I just finished a 6-night stay there. After half my stay I placed a &quot;Please change my linnens&quot; card on my bed to have the linens replaced, but ended up having to call housekeeping to do it a day later, because the card was somehow overlooked.The cleaning was ok, but not great. Bathroom was cleaned well. But dirty glasses weren't replaced. Dust and crumbs from a minibar Twix that I had remained on the desk for a few days. The blank breakfast order forms weren't provided after the first night. Not a big deal but setting aside an extra 5 minutes in the morning is 5 min I could have slept. To be fair, the breakfast was delivered within 15 min after calling in the order. Food was average, but quite pricey.When I enumerated the issues with service on checkout, I got a fairly blank stare and an &quot;Our apologies&quot; from a clerk.Won't stay at this hotel again, for the price I can find much better places in central London."
202,1258,"May 28 2007 	Would happily eat here - but sleep somewhere else.	On arriving the Concierge staff were very helpful. However on gettingto reception there were 8 people in the queue and only one person booking guests in. We headed for the bar to wait as we were booking into 11 rooms!The lounge really does live up to its art deco 1920's design it gives a real feel of luxury..The staff here were friendly and efficient but it is expensive.Then the big let down. My room was on the second floor and on leavingthe lift there was a smell of what I can only describe as stale urine. My room was small and in need of refurbishment. The carpet wasclearly showing age and was very dark in colour around the edges. The bathroom was again in stark need of refurbishment, I could not bring myself to use the bath. I did request an upgrade which I was prepared to pay for. However the hotel was full so I had no choices.The room was also very hot and a large air conditioning unit was in the room without instructions on use. As the room was small so usingthe aircon in such a small area was not practical as it was too noisy.I felt let down and very disapointed for my friends that I had convinced to stay at this hotel also. In my opinion the star rating for the rooms is too high and more a 3 than 4 starBreakfast the service in the restaurant was excellent but as it costsin the region of 25 for cooked breakfast I would expect this. However in their favour it was freshly cooked and of an excellent standard. Boiled eggs cooked by the minute as requested and they were perfect.On trying to check out, the queue now had 16 people in it including our party, with only one member of staff to carry out checkouts. WhenI approached another member of staff in the area to ask them to assist they were very rude and unhelpful. Also one member of staff insisted that we all had to book out separtly whilst her collegue who eventually came to assist allowed us to put multiple rooms on one bill making it faster and efficient. We felt very uncomfortable keeping the other guests waiting whilst we all checked out.But on leaving again the door staff were wonderful."
203,1258,"May 28 2007 	My Brother's Wedding	We attended my brother's wedding at The Park Lane Hotel. This afforded us the opportunity of sampling a lot of what the hotel has to offer.Despite living in London, we decided to stay at the hotel with the rest of the wedding party. The standard double room rate was 187. It was impossible for us to secure any sort of discount despite booking 12 rooms and hiring the ballroom for the evening.The hotel has an entrance on Piccadilly but main access if from the rear - as is the car park. There is no point in bringing your car to the hotel. The tube station is a few minutes away and a return cab fare within central London will cost the same as a 4 hour carpark charge.The hotel seems cramped. It lacks the spacious opulence that one would expect of a 5* hotel on one of London's premium thoroughfares. The entrance is full of Art Deco features and marble, which could be impressive, if only the lighting was designed to show it off. The same could be said of the bar area, which leaves you feeling that you are in a cavern, with its dark stone, high ceilings and subdued lighting. The corridors are also dark and you could be forgiven for thinking that you were in a 3* hotel in Eastern Europe. I remember staying in an Art Deco hotel in Manhattan that had the same feel but, it cost half the price. This running theme does, however, work extremely well in the ballroom. It is two floors underground with a balcony circling it on three sides. It is a lovely area, well proprotioned and fitting for a special event. The only odd part is that you can actually hear the Piccadilly Line trains running beneath you.The suite that my brother hired was beautiful. I don't know how much it cost but, it was full of the overstuffed opulence that one deserves on their wedding night.The &quot;classic&quot; room was a totally different experience. Sheraton are promoting their new sweetsleeper beds. These are about 6' wide and leave the rest of the room cramped. You can just about walk around the bed and that is it. The bed is fantastic for sleeping in. The bathroom was full white mable, which also had a tired feel to it. The usual spread of international TV channels + pay movie + expensive wifi access was provided.The Breakfast room is a small restaurant off the side of the bar. It has the feel of an old English guest house - quite twee and not designed for the modern European marked. Breakfast was not included and commanded a 21 fee for the buffet and &quot;Full English&quot;. Full English didn't include black pudding or beans and others at our table left half full.I wouldn't have chosen this hotel to stay in if were were not going to be there for a function. I have read numerous reviews of adjacent hotels that have a much higher rating in Tripadvisor.Would I stay here again? Only if I had too. Sometimes you want to treat yourself to a hotel room after attending a special function and we happily did that on this occasion but I would suggest others look elswhere in Mayfair for their 5* hotel."
204,1258,"May 26 2007 	Get on the preferred floor!	I had planned a trip to London and was to meet a friend coming from Switzerland. She booked the room using her husband's Sheraton points. She was not able to make it after all, so I used the room by myself. I had no problem checking in, and was happy to find myself on the preferred floor (after reading the terrible reviews.) In fact, I was going to stay a third night but would have had to pay nearly $400 us dollars. I decided against it, as staying near the airport my last night at a great hotel for $75 via hotwire was a great option.Anyway -- this hotel was a treat as it was free to me. The room was old English, clean spacious, great bed and linens and nice bathroom. The terry cloth robes are so heavy and luxurious. The concierge was very helpful each day as I went sight seeing by myself (36 year old female that I am).I could not have asked for a better location -- beautifully situatied by the park and so near the palace.So - if you don't mind the $300-400 a night, AND can get on the preferred floor. Go for it. I didn't have the food as I was not wanting to spend that much. A great option was the Pret A Manger down the street which is like an organic cafe where you can get a &quot;to go&quot; or &quot;take away&quot; piece of fruit, water, sandwhich for cheap."
205,1258,"May 19 2007	Very Pleased with the Park Lane	After reading all the negative reviews, I was really apprehensive about this hotel, which we received through a Priceline bid. We stayed for four nights in April, arriving late on a Saturday evening. We were put into room 514 on a Sheraton Preferred Guest floor. I don't know if that made the difference but we had very few if any complaints about our room. It was large, the beds were very comfortable, linens fresh and crisp, and there was a huge walk in closet with shelves. The bathroom was nice, not modern by any means but not shabby at all. There was a window with a ledge and the window could be opened. The shower was powerful and I did not see any evidence of dirty, cracking tiles or any of the other unsavory things said about this hotel. The location is absolutely fabulous and the room was very quiet. We did not face on Picadilly or the park, which was fine with me as it meant there was no traffic noise (no view either but that was ok). The staff was friendly. There were a few stains on the carpeting, which is the only negative I can think of. If you book this hotel, join the Sheraton preferred club and ask for a room on one of the preferred floors. I actually think our room was a smoking room but I did not notice any smoky smell in the room or the corridors."
206,1258,May 12 2007 	Very unsafe: Money stolen from my room	This hotel has a good location however it needs a lot of brushing up. They have a serious security breach. Safe boxes are not provided in the rooms and double locks for many of the rooms are broken. Somebody stole all my cash from the room while I was gone for 10 minutes. Hotel did not take any responsibility for it although it was a confirmed theft from the hotel. Apart from that rooms are too small and in shabby condition. Room service is incredibly expensive. Something as simple as tea is 7 pounds.Dont stay at this hotel even if its the last one on the earth.
207,1258,"May 8 2007	Quintessentially English	I booked this hotel as a long weekend away with my wife and three daughters using Star Alliance points. Having read some of the reviews on here, I was geared up and ready to demand room changes, hotel changes etc.....But actually it isn't that bad if you don't mind old and quirky hotels and are looking for something with character. Ok it's a little dated and the round the back entrance is hardly the most inspiring (as have most of the old hotels on Park Lane the entrance has been moved from the front to the back). The reception is pure art deco marble and wood, service was great. We arrived at noon expecting to store our luggage until the 3pm check in time, however they apologised that both rooms were not ready and gave us a complimentary coffee voucher for the fabulous Palm room whilst we waited the necessary 20 mins. The rooms themselves were on the 7th floor and had good and bad points. Good - huge spacious rooms, original 'Edwardian?' tiling and units in the bathroom (monster bath), vast comfortable 'sweet sleeper' beds, well stocked mini bar, desk.Bad - If you like your bathroom antiseptic and shiny then you would hate it. Shower an obvious late addition that hung over the bath with one of those curtains that stick to you. Basin a little cramped. Tiles a little cracked here and there. No natural light from the viewless windows, furniture a little dated.The location is fantastic a mere 200 metres across green from the Palace, the Palm room is awesome and if you like olde world tea in the afternoon then there can't be many better places. Live harpist in the early eveningBreakfast in both the Restaurant (21) and the Palm Room (12.00) is a tad on the pricey side and we breakfasted at Henrys Bar, 100 metres up the road for around 7.00 - great value for the full english.Overall, it's not a bland hotel, if you want to stay in a modern Hiltonesque room then don't stay here, but if you don't mind the quirks and the genuine antiquities then this isn't a bad place to stay in Central London"
208,1258,"May 3 2007	5 Stars for location but 3 1/2 star hotel room	The hotel is in a Great location. It's 7 minutes from Buckingham Palace (through Green Park, right across the street). It's 10-15 minutes--very pleasant walk, to Covent Garden and/or Picadilly Square and/or Trafalgar Square. Like I said, the location is fantastic!!The hotel room is not Sheraton level. It doesn't have a hot water pot for coffee or tea. The king bed is actually 2 beds placed together.The Brits are a great bunch of people and very helpful. The exchange rate is absolutely terrible for us USA folks. Here's some useful info.Currency--We had no currency when arriving in London. The train takescredit cards. When you get into town, go to a bank and get change at the most favorable rateTransportation--Heathrow airport is at zone 6 and most of the sightseeing stuff is zone 1-2. From the airport, buy a one day Zone 1-6 pass. It's 6,50 euros and you can use it all day and to get you to the Park Lane hotel. Kids are free upto 11 years old. Take the Picadilly line to Green Park station. Exit at the Picadilly North exit. Make a Right and go about 100 yards. Hotel is on right side. Sightseeing-- Instead of buying those bus tours, we bought a one day travel card for zone 1-2 and rode the city bus and Tube around to sightsee. Stay on the #11, #12 and #15 and it will take you to all the famous sites. Hop on, hop off. The Zone 1-2 pass costs about 4.75 euros. Children free."
209,1258,"Apr 12 2007	Not a 5 star Hotel	This 5 star Hotel is not 5 star service. Breakfast only average, cooked price 21. Corridor rooms smell of sewage , talking to the manager, they know about it but can not do anything ! The rooms for 199 per night are of 3 star quality all very old fittings and none matching furniture. The position near the Ritz and garage parking is the only value we could see in this hotel."
210,1258,"Mar 26 2007 	Don't let these fraudsters have your credit card number!	I stayed in this hotel over a year ago and vowed to myself never to come back. The hotel is in a great location and the public areas actually have a certain amount of nostalgic charm, but the bedrooms are in dire need of renovation and are not even clean, and the bathrooms are simply terrible. This is not a five star hotel; not even four.How surprised was I recently to get a whopping charge on my American Express bill from them, more than a year after my stay. I had prepaid my stay through Orbitz. As it turns out they think they didn't get paid by Orbitz (something Orbitz denies) and finding my credit card number on file, simply helped themselves to a payment. They refuse to talk to Orbitz or do anything at all -- my problem.Steer a wide berth! If you insist on staying there, pay cash!"
211,1258,"Mar 5 2007 	Not very much satisfied	I stayed at this hotel on the last week of February for three nights.Rooms are dated and the bathrooms are just okay. There seems to be some problems in the water system since though I changed my first room and switched to another one I had a difficulty in balancing the hot water and cold water. Some rooms do not have AC, some rooms overlook an odd dam of anothre building. The best thing about this hotel is the location. FYI, the walls are very thin and you can easily waken up by the slamming doors of other rooms."
212,1258,"Mar 3 2007	Good location.	Located just a 3 min walk to the underground, overlooking Green Park in a rather well to do area, so expectations are high. On entry the lounge and downstairs area did not disappoint, however, my 6th floor two roomed suite, although very spacious, was looking tired and in need of a make-over. Sofa bed was broken but noise level was very low so had a good night sleep. Gym was a disappointment being rather small and the equipment lacking. Starwood Platinum Guest complimentary bowl of fruit turned out to be a well matured large bunch of grapes. Did not try the restaurants as there are various alternatives within walking distance. All in all below expectations but my guess is there are better rooms."
213,1258,"Feb 20 2007 	Worst Sheraton I've Stayed In	This hotel is in serious need of refurbishment of the bedrooms. Yes I know it's an old building and yes it's a great location but this doesn't mitigate the fact that the rooms are well past their best. Very dated decor in both the bedrooms and the bathrooms (1970's at best in the beathrooms) rooms looked grubby with cracked tiles in the bathroom, stained carpets etc. Overheated rooms with no way of changing the temperature nor being able to open the windows meant an uncomfortable night. Good front desk staff, but overall would not stay here again. Stayed the previous week at the Holiday Inn Kensington which was in a much better condition and much better value."
214,1258,"Feb 18 2007 	Fabulous Wedding Venue In The Ballroom But Bedrooms Dated	We got married last May in the ballroom which is simply stunning. We searched many hotels as a venue and this beat both the grosvenor , Mayfair and Carlton - In fact it was the best in London. The food and service was top class and really had the wow factor. The night before I stayed in a deluxe room which was very nice but a little dated. It was also noisy ( think it was near the generator). We had the bridal suite the following night which was beautifuly traditional with big oak doors, a massive bathroom, four poster bed, large lounge area and beautiful views over the park. For the cost however the rooms were dated and overpriced. The staff were pleasant but language barrier a problem , very few had english as their first language. Top location , prestigious and a super wedding venue but perhaps not the standard you expect if you are just booking a room to stay in for a visit. The onsite restaurant was informal and pleasant and not too pricey"
215,1258,"Feb 12 2007 	One of the Worst Central London Properties	It was my worst stay ever in London. I make at least one trip a year to this great city and usually stay within the West End of London. As a recent SPG member I thought of staying here considering the great location. But, right from the word go it was quite bad. The day I arrived after a very long and delayed flight, the weather in London was extremely stormy. The taxi from Paddington dropped me on the main road, i.e., Piccadilly. I did not find any doorman to welcome me. Nor there was any proper reception within the hotel through the front entrance. Instead to my utter dismay I found myself into a casual dining area where people were having drinks and eats, some of them stared at me while I was struggling with a suitcase, laptop and a hand bag. After sometime a hotel staff came forward and guided me to the reception at the back of the ground floor. I then discovered that the main entrance was in a small lane off the main road where there was no arrow or sign showing the right way. I booked an executive room with high expectations. But, I was allotted a room without a view and very stuffy. When asked for a change I was refused. Afterwards I spoke to the Duty Manager and insisted in a change of room as I found it to be absolutely suffocating. Hence, it would not be possible to spend two full days and night there. Anyway, after much insistence he obliged and allocated a better room with good view. However, I found hotel staff in every area were quite stiff and unfriendly. The hotel was not of Sheraton class or standard and appeared highly neglected. The front entrance area leading to the dining hall stinks. The aircon controls in room did not work at all, hence, I had to keep my window open throughout the night. Even the towels in the bathroom did not have the desired freshness. All in all nightmarish experience, and never again at Sheraton Park Lane."
216,1258,"Feb 9 2007 	Great Location could use some sprucing up	This hotel has a great location, but it didn't seem to have the same quality as other Sheraton properties I've been to. It felt a little run down, hallways were dark and dreary. Overall, if you can get a good price then this hotel is not bad, but the ownership could stand to spruce it up a bit.Rooms &amp; Bathrooms were pretty standard. They did have a nice looking lounge &amp; restaurant in the lobby, but we didn't eat there. Very close to the subway...really a great location."
217,1258,"Jan 15 2007	Can do better	Stayed here January 2007 for 3 days, was a top-secret hotel off of lastminute.co.uk &quot;picadilly hotel overlooking green park 5*&quot;, paid 109GBP per night inclusive of VATThe location was great, few minutes walk from Green Park closest tube station. Warning letter of radiation being found there to do with the Litvinenko case was a bit disconcerting at check-in, if that kind of thing would stay on your mind best stay elsewhere.Rooms were fairly small, king-size bed was just two twins pushed together which was fairly uncomfortable. Staff insisted that they have no other type of kings available at the hotel, not sure if that is true or not. Bathroom was cramped, and shower was a bit hard to handle with the jet not staying still. Room looked dated, in need of a renovation. View was very drab of a gray building right across the way.Generally the hotel was nice, the Citrus restaurant in the lobby was good, there was a jazz band in the evening in the elegant palm court. Elevator was broken one evening leaving a bit of a hike up to the 6th floor.Cleaning staff was very noisy slamming doors throughout the morning on the weekdays, can make it quite difficult to sleep in. Dated doors and building I think leaves the soundproofing lacking.Overall would probably not stay there again although the area certainly is nice, it is a bit polluted-feeling and I preferred staying closer to gloucester road or some such area."
218,1258,Jan 1 2007 	Not my favorite hotel	We stayed one night in a suite. Very hard to reach their front desk by phone; for 2 hours couldn't get through to them. Some concierges were better than others. Service was fairly good. Food and beverage tasted OK but my wife got very stomach sick right after eating breakfast there and it may have been the food. Room size was decent and the bathroom was large but these old English tubs are quite dangerous to get in and out of and the room itself had poor air conditioning and heating and we slept all night without clothes on because we couldn't open the windows and couldn't control the room temperature. Engineering might have solved the problem but it was after midnight and my baby was sleeping so we just lived with it. Hotel needs a major HVAC overhaul and modernizing of its bathrooms.
219,1258,"Dec 18 2006	Nice location	We ended up enjoying our stay at the Park Lane. The location was great. My wife enjoyed the tea, and the family really enjoyed the English breakfasts. We were able to experience the two-faces of the Park Lane. We checked in and were told they had no connecting rooms in their hotel. We were given two very small rooms that were without a doubt the worst hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. The bathrooms were so antiquated and unkept that it was ridiculous. I told the night manager we need to change rooms, but no help. The next day I told the day manager that I would be departing early from our 4 night stay and would be searching for a new hotel. He asked if I could pay an additional 40gbp per night per room, and he could get us two suites. I agreed, and we went from staying in the likes of a homeless shelter to two nice hotel suites. Amazing. The fitness center was the best--it looked like they got some equipment from a torture chamber from the Spanish Inquisition."
220,1258,"Dec 2 2006	overall o.k. but best avoided	The Park Lane Sheraton has had its best days in the 1930s and does not appear to have been refurbished since then. You could say its charming, but you could also say it's a rip-off. A hotel of this category and price range should at least have clean carpets and wallpapers and contemporary sanitary faciltiies. The Park Lane Sheraton does not, at least not the room I was staying in. I won't try it again."
221,1258,"Nov 27 2006	Not that bad...	After reading some of the posts, I contacted the hotel directly to voice some concern about my reservation. The hotel returned my email and assured me that the hotel was absolutely up to standards. As a Starwood member and frequent visitor to other Starwood properties, I had traded in points for this trip - so I didn't want them wasted!Overall, not a bad experience. The hotel is older, but not in bad shape. My only complaint would be the noise of the hotel staff. Our room was on a Starwood level next to the service area. We were abruptly awakened at 7 am each morning to very noisey staff. Besides that however, we found our room clean and large, by European standards. The twin beds were a bit of a challenge, but we made do.I have to admit, for the price, it's a bit of a stretch. But you can't beat the central location and generally the hotel offers a pleasant experience."
222,1258,"Nov 27 2006 	Not Luxurious but adequate	We stayed in this hotel for a week towards the end of November. Upon arriving at 8:30 a.m. from an overnight flight and fearing a long wait until check in, we were told to our pleasant surprise that our room would be ready in 20 minutes. The room was nice, somewhat large, but oddly, it had no dresser. The large bathroom was nice and had plenty of towels. Anyway, it overlooked Green Park and was three blocks from either the Green Park or Hyde Park Corner underground/subway station. While the view was great, it faced east and the rising sun would quickly brighten the room forcing us awake. The staff of the hotel was generally friendly, but the concierge assured us that we could arrive 30 minutes early for the changing of the guard and still get a good view. He was wrong. Get there 45 minutes to an hour early."
223,1258,Nov 5 2006 	Our favorite London hotel	We have stayed at the Park Lane numerous times for the past 6 years. We have always had clean comfortable rooms and beds. We love coming back from the theatre and sitting in the beautiful elegant Palm Court for tea or snacks with excellent service. There is no other setting like this in London. Breakfast buffet is great too.Great service is received from all staff routinely. Excellent location as well. Don't hesitate to stay here.
224,1258,"Oct 29 2006 	Great Stay	As an SPG Gold member, we got a large room on the 8th floor.Immaculate and roomy. No bugs, stains, smells.The concierge was most helpful, and the other staff was courteous and attentive.Wonderful location. A short walk to Green Park tube station. An easy walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace.I sure didn't see the &quot;other hotel&quot; that some people describe."
225,1258,"Oct 24 2006 	New carpet and a little paint would help tremendously.	After reading prior reviews, I was most apprehensive about staying at the hotel. I decided to contact Sheraton directly before our arrival and received an email from the assistant manager at The Park Lane. He assured us we had nothing to worry about. We checked into a wonderful room with a huge marble bath and confortable king size bed. The staff was gracious and helpful. We enjoyed our continental breakfast each morning. And, you just can't beat the location. It is absolutely fabulous. But. Bottom line. The hotel is well worn and needs fresh paint and carpet. Desperately. Bath towels and complimentary robes were almost ratty. In European hotels, the quietest rooms are those that do not face a street where a guest can hear the traffic outside. While our view was less than desirable being on the backside of the hotel, it was quiet and we were never disturbed. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would choose the hotel again. I am fairly confident management is aware of the comments circulating about the hotel and, hopefully, will continue to bring the hotel up to 5 star standards."
226,1258,"Oct 23 2006 	Not too bad	Booked this through lastminute.com TopSecret hotel offers and were slightly worried by some of the other reports. However, had a pleasant Saturday and Sunday night. The room on the 6th floor (a Starwood preferred traveller floor) was about average sized for a London hotel, with a very comfy King bed and a slightly tired but functional bathroom. The hotel seemed pretty quiet so obviously mainly a business hotel -confirmed by the mini-bar and room service inflated prices (3 for a can of coke, 2 for a kit-kat), but there were plenty of food places between Green Park and the hotel. Ate a fantastic meal on Sunday evening at Tamarind [&quot;&quot;] only 2 minutes walk away."
227,1258,"Oct 23 2006 	Stinky biz hotel.	Yucky, this hotel is awful. It's a business hotel and really is awful. This was a big disappointment."
228,1258,"Oct 22 2006 	Ok	We got this hotel from Priceline so it was a good deal but if you pay full price stay somewhere else. We first checked in and went to our room, opened the door and there was someone elses luggage in the room! Went straight back to checkin and told them what I found, they immediate gave me a new room (upgraded too) without me asking for one or checking why luggage was in the room they gave me. I thought this was the correct response but was not sure I would get this since it was a Pirceline room.The room we had was and Executive w/ King bed. It was a great size (see pics) with large bathroom and walk in closet! But did feel like it was not updated in 20 years. The bed was new, super comfortable. Nice hotel but in need of any upgrade for sure.Bathroom was very large, double sink, large shower and a tub. No power outlet for a hairdryer but they did provide one that could be used in room itself.Walk to tube was about 5 min (Green Park) so fairly close.Internet was super slow. They have T-Mobile UK which is a pay service and it was horribly slow, could not upload our photos from the trip.I am giving it 3 stars but I feel like if I did not get an upgrade it would be 2-stars."
229,1258,Oct 21 2006	Gracious hotel in the centre of it all	I love the sprawling old rooms with the amazing bathrooms. Possibly Londons best location for theatre and shopping without the needless pretension of other nearby venues . We'll stay again .
230,1258,"Oct 20 2006 	Overall positive experience	I am rating this hotel above average because it tends to be more modestly priced than others in the area, and because of its great location. As pointed out by other reviewers, it is faded. And many rooms do face interior walls or ducts. But open windows provide fresh air. The air conditioning works once you figure it out. The staff is generall helpful. Their food prices were not bad while we were there...a special of 20 pounds for 2 courses, or 13 pounds for one course. And a 25% discount on drinks. But beware mini-bars or room service unless you just don't care what it costs. Breakfast in the dining room is a terrible value. But the same continental breakfast they offer for 20 pounds in the dining room is available in the lobby for 7.50. Its listed on the lobby bar menu. They seemed not to want to serve it to us at first, but eventually they did. The largely eastern european staff can be a bit authoritarian, but insisting (and a smile at the same time) seems to get the job done.The public rooms are very pretty, left over from the 30s I would guess. Great location. If you can get a deal I would stay there again."
231,1258,"Oct 16 2006 	You Need An Upgrade	We booked a tour through British Airways that included flight and hotel. We picked the Park Lane because it was a 5star hotel. We knew going in that we were getting a standard room, but figured a 5star standard would be fine. We were wrong. We were given Room 331. It smelled, the carpet was stained, there was a lack of drawer space, and the bathroom was sub-par. The toilet seat was broken, as was the door handle to the bathroom. The shower looked like something out of the 1940's. There was no place to put our toiletries. We went right back down to the front desk and asked to be upgraded. To their credit, they were very nice. Because one of us had a Starwood account, we were given a free upgrade to the Starwood Preferred Traveler floor, Room 739. It was lovely. Beautiful marble bath with separate shower stall with glass doors and a marble floor and large vanity. Overall, we enjoyed our stay there. The room was kept immaculate, the continental breakfast was good, and you cannot beat the location. I would stay there again if I knew I had an upgraded room."
232,1258,"Oct 10 2006 	Believe what you read it's awful	Needs a complete refurb, i complained twice until on the third occasion i got a decent room, admitedly i booked the hotel on a very cheap deal through Lastminute top secret hotels but regardless of that the rooms were very dated, the bathroom could have been used by Winston Churchill it was that old.The location is good, but if your going to stay get a room with a view otherwise you will be looking at bricks and air con units.There are much much better hotels in central london such as the Melia whitehouse in regents park or No1 Aldwych.Oh and if you want a tip for a great meal then try the Oxo Tower bookable through the Harvey Nicols web site"
233,1258,"Oct 6 2006	Vile	I cannont for one second understand a single good review on this website, this is by far the most vile hotel i've stayed in. I had better encounters in Texas Motel's when i was a teenager. and i assure you it didn't cost me GBP 200+.Checked out within 20 mins, after finding a member of staff that could actually string together a sentence in english.DO NOT STAY HERE. EVEN IF ITS FREE."
234,1258,"Oct 3 2006	Roaches the size of small rats	We got to hotel two days ago and check out tomorrow. Spacious but chipped paint and very weak internet signal. Last night and this morning saw two black roaches about four inches long. One crawled onto the bed and over my foot. We called downstairs and complained but to no avail - &quot;a maintenance man would be by shortly&quot; but no one did.I guess when you think about it, there isn't much a hotel can do when it has a roach infestation. I say it's an infestation because there was zero attempt for the hotel to follow up on the incident this morning. No maintenance man to come by, no call in the morning, nothing. So you figure that this probably wasn't the first time or second time such a thing has occured - hence, an infestation.Let's be honest. Roaches aren't the worst thing in the world. And really, you're supposed to be out on the town in London, not in your hotel room writing an email on tripadvisor.com. But it's sort of disgusting for a hotel to charge as much as this place did and then not react at all. I'm sure other people would have flipped their lid about the roach, and demanded another room. For us, we were too busy from recuperating after working all day. So we named him Casey. Because when you have a vermin infestation, and there's nothing that can be done and you leave tomorrow, maybe the best thing to do is to reclassify it from vermin to Casey."
235,1258,"Sep 27 2006 	Faded hotel in great location	Booked one night on spg points, with upgrade to small suite.Very old fashioned, 80s style room and furniture. room was a bit stuffy, I don't know if the AC was working or not......ordered room service brandy a large VSOP remy - and was presented with a bill for 40 - arounf 70US. Price of two bottles in an off licence. I expect hotels to charge a margin, but this was a bit too much! I asked for it to be sent back - and we settled on 20 with some negotiation at the door. Room service breakfast was OK, on time and as ordered.Not a 5 star hotel - I guess an average 3 star hotel with top end 4 star prices and a great location."
236,1258,"Sep 26 2006 	Bed Bugs	The hotel is old and some rooms are small and dark. We were shown three rooms before we selected room 720 which we discovered too late had bed bugs. The management wasn't too reseptive in compensating for this inconvience, and unpleasant experience, The location was great, and the staff in general were quite friendly and efficient. I would not stay there again when in London."
237,1258,"Sep 8 2006 	A pleasant suprise	I booked this hotel for a very reasonable rate through lastminute.com. At 119.00 for a 5* Hotel I thought was wonderful. However, after reading the bad reviews on trip advisor I began having second thoughts. We decided to chance it anyway as we were having tea at the Ritz and this hotel is only a few minutes down the road. I have to say, our experience was wonderful. Beautiful hotel, lovely clean spacious room and very helpful staff. The bathroom was dated but very clean and with the most powerful shower I've ever experienced. We would definately visit this hotel again."
238,1258,"Sep 7 2006	It did get better	Stayed here having booked direct through SPG. Advised the hotel it was my husbands birthday but that was ignored. Anyway arrived early (1230) no rooms available but did not mind - we went to lunch in Citrus attached to the hotel which was very good with pleasant service. Were able to check in around 2pm - the second floor room was small, faced an inner courtyard but that did not bother us as it seemed quiet; however we should have rumbled the portable AC unit as a clue to something not quite right. It became clear the AC did not work, the portable machine was fused, phone line was dea, bathroom door lock faulty etc etc. The phone was the biggest issue for us as we were expecting calls all trip. To be fair reception were very quick to move us to another room which was nicer - bigger bathroom and to call up later to check all was OK. We ate again later on our 2 night trip in Citrus which we enjoyed again. We did not have breakfast in the hotel - too expensive, but went to the hotel coffee shop next door one day and brought some pastries and coffee to the room (you can charge them to the room) the second day we went to Starbucks which is on the way to the tube station anyway. There are not a lot of good eating places very near, but the Tube trip to Leicester Square is only 2 stops and you are in Chinatown. The nearby tube (Green Park) is ideal as it has three lines going through it so you get a real good choice.So the location is good, the hotel was not the best value you can get in London and it does seem to be hit or miss whether you get an OK room or not. Some investment in the fabric could make all the difference if Sheraton intend to keep this hotel in their portfolio - you just get the feel they are undecided here so are saving their cash for the time being"
239,1258,"Aug 27 2006 	Don't let the Lobby fool you!	The main lobby is quite nice and you think you have stumbled upon a real winner in a great location, but don't let the lobby fool you! Once you exit the main lobby and enter the check-in area in the back, which is nothing special, you realize you may not be in for such a nice stay. Most people enter and check-in to the hotel from the back, as the front of the hotel sits on a very busy main street, so one would think that it would also be quite nice and luxurious. Not quite.The first problem we had was that our room was on the first floor, was the size of a closet, and overlooked a plethora of plumbing pipes and rusty AC units. There was also some sort of dryer vent type piping that you placed outside your window to suck in all the fresh, clean air--apparently this was supposed to serve as your air conditioning. Not what we were expecting to see for the exhorbitant price we paid. Needless to say, we tried to change rooms and thought we had succeeded, until we arrived back at the hotel that night only to be greeted to the neighboring room on that same floor with the same &quot;charming&quot; view, AC set-up, etc. We complained again, much harsher this time, and finally got the big room on one of the higher floors. This was a decent room with decent air conditioning, but there were plumbing problems in the bathroom. The sink was leaking out the bottom. In general, the bathrooms are nothing to write home about.Overall, the hotel is quite dingy and needs a serious renovation, especially for what you pay! It is in a nice, swanky location, but that is all the more reason to update. I would not recommend staying here ever until you know for sure that they have had a serious overhaul. There are other just as expensive hotels nearby, so go with those instead."
240,1258,"Jul 16 2006	Fabulous location beautiful hotel	I stayed at this hotel for two nights (6/18 &amp; 6/19) with my mother and my two young boys (ages 6 &amp; 3). This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel within 6 months. The location cannot be beat. It is just fabulous. The hotel is on the older side but it is very charming. I did not encounter any smells either stay and rather liked the hotel. The staff bent over backwards to accomodate me. I felt that the room I was given was too small (but had a beautiful view) for all of us and they immediately moved us to a much larger room. The bellmen were great, housekeeping was great. Everyone I encountered in the hotel was wonderful. We all had a comfortable stay and would absolutely go back... and will soon. Don't hesitate to stay here. It's a wonderful hotel."
241,1258,"Jul 14 2006	Great Disappointment	We have been a Sheraton member and exchanged our Sheraton points for one night accommodation at Park Lane Sheraton on July 8. It was not an acceptable experience at all. We checked in at 10:30PM (already informed them about the late arrival). The reception desk was friendly, but gave us a room, #231, which was ALREADY OCCUPIED! You can imagine how surprised when we heard someone talking in the room and saw the dinners plates left in front of the room before we even tried to open the door! We did not want to disturb the people in #231 so we went back to the reception desk. They apologized and gave us another room #345. #345 is in a terrible shape. Problem 1, the carpet. The carpet on the hallway, which is highly trafficked, is much much clearner than the carpet in the guest room. I don't even know whether they have done any effort to clean the stains on the carpet at all. I decided to put my shoes on. Problem 2, the closet. We turned the doorknob several times but the door just refused to budge, so we thought that it might be a dummy door for no reason. Later when we couldn't find the hairdryer, we did our best to open that closet door. It is much more difficult than getting into Naria! Problem 3, dirty bathrobe. There were two in the room. One was clean and the other was with yellow stains. Even though we exchanged our points for a free accommodation , but a room with a price tag of GBP169 per night and a dirty bathrobe? Think again!Room is small. Bathroom is small and with a early 20th century deco. The bed is good, at least it is up to Sheraton's standard. Location is good. Will I ever return to this hotel? No!"
242,1258,"Jul 13 2006	Very Comfortable Room	I stayed at the Park Lane with my two children (ages 13 and 15) on June 23 for one night. We arrived at 8am and they let us have a room by 9:30am, which we appreciated since we had flown all night from the States.We had a twin room (and they put an additional cot in the room for my son) for 149 Pounds per night, taxes and breakfast not included. All beds (including the cot) were made up in the Sheraton &quot;sweet sleeper&quot; style and we were very comfortable. The room had the usual high-end amenities: TV, AC, phone, Mini-bar, hairdryer, and shampoos, lotion, etc. Our room didn't have a view of anything other than the side of another building, but since I had selected one of the lower rates offerred by the hotel, I was not expecting a view. The room was fairly large and very quiet (never heard any neighbors). The bathroom was long and narrow with a full tub, but it was covered in marble and just lovely (very clean as well).I noticed the prior reviews of smells and such, we didn't encounter anything negative here, smells or otherwise. It is an old hotel, but I agree that I would have been unhappy if I had had the same issues on my stay. I have never had these problems at the Park Lane; my experiences at this hotel, for the past 8 years or so, have always been postiive like this one.We didn't eat at the hotel, as the restaurant is pretty pricey, but for breakfast on the first day, we went to &quot;Pret a Manger&quot; (about 2 blocks away on Picadilly) and picked up croissants, pastries and drinks. The second morning, we went to a little grocery store by Marks &amp; Spencer (about 2-3 short blocks away on Picadilly) for fresh fruit, croissants, yogurt drinks and then to Starbucks for coffee. Both much less expensive options than breakfast at the hotel, and a better fit for what my kids wanted to eat.The staff were very kind, gracious and accomodating; the housekeeping staff were very efficient. I have stayed at the Park Lane over the years many times, always picking one of the least expensive rooms offered, and I would definitely stay there again. The location cannot be beat. It is a few blocks from the Green Park tube, a few blocks to Hyde Park, a couple tube stops to Knightsbridge (Harrods, etc) and Sloane Square. In the past I have stayed at the Park Lane alone and I found the area quite safe for a woman alone. Not far away is shopping, Leicester square (half-off tickets for theater) and loads of great restaurants and pubs. This isn't a budget traveler's hotel, as the tax brought my rate closer to 190 pounds (about $350), but it is a reliable, safe, pleasant and very comfortable place to stay. I would definintely recommend the Park Lane Sheraton."
243,1258,"Jul 7 2006	don't understand all the complaining	I stayed at the Sheraton Park Lane with my wife and 8 year old daughter in one room and my in-laws had a junior suite. My in-laws were given a lovely suite. I failed to mention that my daughter was staying in the room with us since I was expecting a king size bed where we could all fit. Unfortunately, I was given a smallish room with a queen bed and since the hotel was fully booked they could not change our room that night. They were quick to accomodate us by putting a cot in the room for the first night and then moving us to a nice executive room with king size bed the next night. It probably helped that I was a gold-level frequent traveler of this hotel chain, but I found them very accomodating.The rooms and lobby were immaculately clean and there were no odors as suggested by earlier reviewers. This hotel is a grand old dame and you have to expect some difficulties with hotels of this age, but in general I found the hotel and service very good. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, especially the Citrus Restaurant. And if you want to avoid a VERY expensive breakfast, there is a great coffee shop attached to the hotel serving top quality coffee + cappucino and baked goods. The location is perfect with Green Park sprawled out across the street and a 200 meter walk to Buckingham Palace. In addition, the cozy Shepards Market area is tucked in behind the hotel with GREAT bars and restaurants. The Spanish tapas restaurant around the corner in the back of the hotel is good and reasonable (especially for Mayfair). The only thing one could quibble about is the cost. At $350-400 per room it is a bit pricey, but again it is London. If you are on a budget this is not for you. But if you want convenience and comfort I found the hotel very acceptable. There are probably better places in London for the money, but this is not a bad hotel. If the cost doesn't bother you, or if you can get a good deal, enjoy. We did!"
244,1258,"Jul 6 2006	Very Disappointing	I stay regularly at Sheraton hotels and have not normally been disappointed - they are usually a safe option and some of them have been great. I have stayed in the this hotel before as well and had a great room and a great experience although it was some years ago now.However, it is really showing its age and the quality of the service was very poor. The room was really too small for this class of hotel, it was dirty and very noisy. We were over charged after we had left and had to really chase around to get it sorted. Luckily in the end we found a duty manager who was willing to get something done - very good reponse from her.Overall, not a Sheraton quality and I would not go back again."
245,1258,"Jun 14 2006 	Hotel has gone south	I have stayed at this hotel many times because it is located close to our London office and has been fairly solid. This time, I arrived at 5:00 am and had to book a room so I could have a $500 shower before work. Fine. That's how its played, I understand.However, I get the smallest dirtiest room I've ever been a part of...they even have a winowless air conditioner. AWEFUL.. the room is crazy small. The window looks out into a cement wall. I call them saying that I am (was) a frequent customer and that I have never gotten a small and dirty room from them before. They said they'd upgrade me but not unti the afternoon...so I had to pack up everythng that I laid out and get it ready for a move before work.When I get back from work, The nice lady at the front desk says that they have a better room for me and sends me on my way. 618.. It looks great until I get into the bathroom. It smells like raw sewage. In the tub there is what appears to be fecal matter and vomit. Pictures attached.I call downstairs and ask what they can do. They say that I have to stay in that room and maybe they can offer me another room tomorrow for another 40 quid a night. (the Supervisor is talking here)I am not sure what I am going to do - I have never seen anything like this. This was at one pont a 5 star hotel but has obviously decayed dramatically. I would give it 2 stars not even considering the festering fecal matter in my tub that I HAVE to deal with.I will update again soon"
246,1258,"Jun 11 2006 	No Good!	the hotel is trying but there are many problems.the first one is the strong &quot;sewer line smell&quot; on the entire main floor.also: i can speak few lenguages including spanish, one of the waitress at the hotel &quot;citrus&quot; restaurante was from spain and while I was enjoying holding a conversation in spanish with her, another &quot;blond&quot; hair waitress came to the table to take our order...I asked her &quot;do you also speak spanish?&quot;, she answer with an attitude &quot;of course not!&quot;...because I was in the fun side I responded to her &quot;oohhh, you are really missing a lot of fun!&quot;, and again with a bad attitude thse answered back &quot;i don't think so&quot;!!! and she continued cleaning the other tables with ungry....I will never return to a hotel like that, I cannot accept this kind of discrimination in europe, where &quot;lenguages&quot; are abruptally changed just taking a flight of 30 minutes or less!...sorry Park Lane you are missing the english traditional class!"
247,1258,"Jun 4 2006	Great Location- Small Room	I stayed in the Park Lane Sheraton for one night in May. While the hotel location was excellent- right near Buckingham Palace and the tube- as well as many good restaurants, the room size was very small for what I paid. I basically tripped over the bed right as I walked into the room and barely had enough room to open the bathroom door. And as opposed to central airconditioning, there was only a freestanding air conditioner in the room- that did not seem to even work. On my return to London I would try and stay in a similar location, but at a different hotel."
248,1258,"Jun 3 2006 	Quality Service at a Graceful but Ageing Star	I stay here most months when working in London and choose this as my base over and above many hotels. Other reviews may be based on a single stay, my opinion is based on dozens of nights! If you read other reviews you may ask why stay here, let me tell you:* The location is just fantastic, just a short ride into the heart of the West End but if you prefer a stroll then Green and Hyde Park are just a few minutes away. Mayfair provides excellent eating and shopping.* Easy access from Green Park tube, providing three tube lines across London* Rooms are quiet. The design of the hotel keeps you away from the 4 lane highway that is Picadilly providing a comfortable and peacful night. Not true of many City Hotels.* The staff are excellent without exception. There is never any delay on arrival or departure and nothing is too much trouble.* Want to stay in? Well the in room dining provides quality food at a reasonable price.* Yes the bathhrooms are old style, but they are clean and the water is plentiful and hot unlike some other 4 star hotels I stay in* Yes the hotel reception is at the back, but so what? I dont stay in the reception!* Yes the lifts are old, but they always work efficiently* Palm court bar is atmospheric and quite original* Beds are most comfortableThe hotel is in need of a make over but it provides qood quality accomodation at a reasonable price in the heart of Europes leading city. What more could you want?"
249,1258,"Jun 1 2006	Great Location..Poor Quality Hotel	I booked this trip online for a 3 night stay in London...Was not able to check in until after 5pm....had to go to 3 rooms to get one that was acceptable..The 3rd room was large, clean, but dumpy..and the hallways remind you of an old hotel from the 60's...musty and worn..and unless you book a suite, forget the windows facing the street...you will have a horrid view of other roofs or other windows, even in an &quot;executive&quot; room. The Air Conditioning that they advertise was a joke...you will need to open the windows..and for these rates and calling themselves a 5 star hotel, that was unacceptable. I complained upon returning home, and after several days, I recieved an attempt at an apology letter, basically just brushing me off, inviting me to call if I was returning to the hotel, and they would work to make me comfortable...they need not worry, I will not be returning to this hotel..for the money that this hotel charges, you can book a nice hotel...I will give them credit for a great location."
250,1258,"May 21 2006	A great disappointment	This is not a 5 star hotel. Our small room, sold as a double, was clearly a single as evidenced by the single bed head. Dirty carpets and chairs. Antiquated bathroom. No tea making facilities. No trouser press. Poor breakfast service. The light continental breakfast eventually appeared after three requests and a half hour wait."
251,1258,May 1 2006	a perfectly fine stay	I stayed there twice in April as part of a vacation. The first time had an outstanding room...the second time I felt i had a perfectly fine but not great room. Will stay there again because I love the location. Both times room did not face Picadilly which I think was a plus...room was super quiet. Staff was alway very accomodating. While dated in some parts--it is a very comfortable hotel. I always take the Tube into London from Heathrow...and it was a very easy walk to the hotel.
252,1258,"Apr 28 2006	This hotel is highly underrated!	After reading some of the reviews, we had some hesitations about this property. We were very pleased with our stay here. The rooms were large and well decorated. The bathrooms were very spacious. The bed linens were very nice and the bed was extremely comfortable. The concierge staff were all very helpful. We had cocktails two evenings in the lobby bar and were very pleased with the quality and service. The location of this hotel is great - close to Green Park tube station, close to Shepard's Market area where we ate most of our meals. We would definitely stay here again."
253,1258,"Apr 24 2006	better than expected	After reading the negative reviews on here I was braced for the worst. The hotel, while in need of some upgrading, was a pleasent experience. We had two rooms on the same floor. One had been remodeled, one was not. The remodeled room had a new bath and was a bit brighter.What was lacking in the rooms was made up in service. The staff was courteous and extremely helpful. The buffet breakfast was always fresh and ample. The staff could not have been more attentive.The location was excelent, just beyond the fringe of the hectic Picadilly Circus. Many restaurants just seconds away in Shepherd Market.The high tea in the Palm Court is one of the highest rated in London.My kids loved the Original Hard Rock Cafe, which is 1 block away. The concierge at the hotel provided us with a card that gave us priority seating and shortened our wait considerably.A Marks &amp; Spencer market nearby on Picadilly had a great selection of snacks, drinks and ready to go meals, a real moneysaver when traveling with teens in $$$London."
254,1258,"Feb 14 2006	See beyond the obvious	Having stayed at Sheraton Park Lane just over a year ago, I fully expected that it would now be undergoing its transformation to a 'W' by now. However it is still going strong and I feel it is somewhat maligned by alot of the criticism it receives, although I feel sympathy with some of the comments. We stayed for three nights from the 10th of February and found the treatment from all staff we encountered was friendly and enthusiastic. We ate in 'Citrus' restaurant and had excellent meals with interesting and reasonably priced wines,(an unusual but very tasty Mexican syrah at 20 a bottle) the total cost of the meal for two with pre meal drinks around 70. Breakfasts are also a treat as they are all cooked fresh as standard, no hard bacon or congealed scrambled egg from the warmer trays that you get in most other Starwood Hotels, also a large pot of coffee is left on your table and plenty of hot toast. The rooms, while in need of a spruce up, are comfortable with very restful and spacious beds, the bathrooms are adequate for their purpose - but when the transformation is complete I hope I still get copious towels and jets of hot water I get now! At the end of the day it is still a fine hotel in an excellent location with friendly staff, true, the lifts clank and are scratched, true, the main entrance round the back has to be one of the most drab and uninspiring of any Sheraton and true, the overall feel is of a hotel well past its sell by date. I get the feeling that positive comments come from its regular clientele who know its obvious failings, while most negative reviews come from those who visit it for a first and seemingly only time and I can fully see their point of view. I think this must be my last visit to Park Lane as a Sheraton, although I thought that last year. Its transformation to a 'W' will alter it out of all proportions (a swimming pool deck built over the Palm Court lounge!), the tapestries and the panelling will probably disappear, as will its very English quaintness. If you want to experience a piece of old English tradition, albeit with its stated drawbacks I should grab it soon."
255,1258,"Jan 30 2006	Don't know what you're all complaining about	I'm on my third of three nights here now.I can't for the life of me figure out what all the complaints are about (well most of them anyway). I had three free nights coming to me from a Starwood promotion and I used them here because when I come to London I prefer to stay in Mayfair. Based on the reviews my expectations were that I would have no more then a place to sleep and the location. So I was quite surprised when it far exceeded the low expectations indicated by the reviews.The staff at check in were courteous and helpful and offered an upgrade (without my asking) despite the fact that my room was free. Ok most of them do not have English as their mother tongue, but this is London afterall and that's pretty common especially in the hotel industry. Nonetheless they all spoke colloqual English.My room on the 4th floor is spacious, clean and comfortable even if it doesn't have much of a view. My one gripe is that there is no safe in the room. None of the smells described by other reviewers were present. The bathroom and plumbing are old, but work well and the towel warmer is a nice touch. Room service breakfast arrived on time, hot, and exactly as ordered. It was actually quite good, not just good for room service. Again staff were polite and efficient. Service carts were removed promptly when left in the hallway.As for the entrance in the back on Brick Street, remember this: This hotel was built in the days when cars, servants, and luggage entered through the mews and guests entered through the lobby. There are other hotels in London like this.Yeah this place could do with an overhaul, but I really have no serious complaints and I'd stay here again even if I had to pay for it. London hotels are generally not fantastic except for the very top places such as Claridge's."
256,1258,"Jan 21 2006	Stayed for free=that is what it is worth.	This hotel has great potential-and that is all. I had to reject three rooms to get one to stick. Our first room was in the corner beind two smelly elevators. Went to the front desk to hear &quot;sorry-fully booked&quot; finally after waiting four hours got an acceptable room, A vacuum cleaner spent three days in the hallway unused as was dirty dishes for hours. The room was clean but the hallways looked sixty years old, Spend some money and revive this fine all property!!!"
257,1258,"Jan 21 2006	A balanced review--lets stick to the facts	I stayed here for 10 days in early January, 2006. I booked through British Airways, since I flew with them from the USA, and they had what I knew to be a good discount price. I had already compared prices by looking online through Starwood/Sheraton website, and by calling to the hotel directly on the phone and consulting the Guide Michelin. I got a free night (special deal) and a generally reduced rate overall. I also made sure to join the Starwood Preferred Guest program (free). Now, let's go over why there is/was a discount, what I got for the $$$$, and some other facts. Prior reviews have noted the inconveninet back street reception entrance on Brick Street, and the even worse idea of arriving at the Piccadilly entrance and having to drag your bags through the Palm Court to the rear of the hotel and up and down two small flights of stairs and through 3 sets of doors to reach the lifts. But, if you have read the reviews here and done your research as you should..you should know about the layout and be easily able to avoid it. The taxi drivers (all) knew about this entrance problem and they do NOT drop you at the Piccadilly entrance unless you insist. Do NOT arrive via the Underground at Green Park, as you must walk approximately 4 blocks and then negotiate the (narrow) Brick Street to reach the reception entrance. Arrive via Taxi, and best to use the Heathrow Express from the airport to Paddington Station. Much more convenient to use than the Tube.  As to the room, the discount I got reflected some deterioration in the room condition. I had a &quot;preferred room&quot; , at least I was TOLD so...However, the room did have a large crack in the ceiling plaster, and some peeling and cracked paint in two relatively small locations in the bathroom, in the spots where you would expect paint to crack first in any bathroom. There were also 3 extensively cracked faux marble floor tiles in the bathroom with one small piece missing in one spot. All the appliances and etc worked and were in good order, though the provided hair dryer located on the bathroom wall seemed to be an antique type that was not very effective. Another, hand-held, more modern type hair dryer was in the closet however, if you preferred to use that. The bed was very comfortable. The heat worked well and never experienced any cold. The doors of the other rooms do close loudly, as other reviews have said. But, they are old style, heavy wooden things and if the other guests just were to CLOSE them, rather than SLAM them..it would not be a real problem.  The hotel is remodeling NOW. I could see the work going on in other rooms. So, it seems the peeling paint problems and tiles may soon be fixed. There was no view from this room. It looked onto a fire escape. It was not the largest room, nor the smallest, room on the floor. I read the &quot;fire plan layout&quot; on the room door to learn this. the hotel location is excellent, and very convenient to manay things/places. But it is an older hotel that needs manitenance in the rooms and the lifts. These problems can be corrected fairly easily and SOME are being done now.Is it 5 stars? No...its a 3 now...but it could be a 4 soon. Actually, if you paid more than I did for an Executive Room or a Suite you'd likely say it was a 4 star now. Get a discount, join the Preferred Guest thing and shop around. There are better hotels sure, but this one is not too bad."
258,1258,"Jan 10 2006	Location the biggest strength.	I was able to take the Piccadilly Line and disembark at Green Park, literaly walk 2 blocks west on Piccadilly and walk into the hotel. Traveling as a lone female, the ease of finding the hotel was a major plus for me. However, it's decidedly unsexy to have to wheel your suitcases in through the Palm Court, disrupting everyone that's having their lunch or tea. I may be American but I try not to draw attention to that fact, and the hotel's layout, with the concierge at the back side of the hotel was no help. Once you are familiar with the hotel and know the back street entrance, obviously, you can avoid this scenario, but it is annoying to have to make that accomodation.If you are on the upper floors you might have a great view of Green Park. Unfortunately, the room I stayed in faced into an interior courtyard, courtyard being a generous word for more bizarre design. There was some kerfuffle about another guest having reserved our room, because he stays in the same room every year. The room was by no means awful, but it was definitely not worth making a pilgrimage for.The concierge's desk was ridiculously not helpful in negotiating when we were supposed to move to the other room and also in checking out. We were doing them a favor, and no one would answer questions like, &quot;When will the new room be ready, etc.&quot;For our trouble in moving we were upgraded to a much larger suite...but decided to just bag it and go stay at their sister hotel, the Sheraton Park Tower in Knightsbridge...a bit pricier, but a much better experience. Although I did prefer the Mayfair location."
259,1258,"Jan 3 2006	Pathetic - Stay Away Until Re-fit and price review	I spent around 20 minutes in this hotel, of which 35 seconds were in my room at the Park Lane Sheraton before getting into the noisey drab and worn out lift back down to the back street style reception for a full refund and check-out. My &quot;double&quot; room costing 175+vat+parking+breakfast was smaller than the room i had at university, not to mention dirtier and darker. I didn't see the bathroom but as my partner came out with a look of disgust i took her word that it was rubbish.To continue my complaints, I had to park (and quickly collect) my own car, admitidly it's 15 feet away but i had to go around the block just to get to the entrance, and after squeezing through the hobbit style filthy door out of the garage i had a dirty jacket and bag. And on... The staff have the most basic grasp of English i have encountered in a London hotel, this is just not cricket, the capital of the UK in an American owned hotel and no one could understand me, especially when i went to complain.There was a bar/dining room in the front of the hotel which was very very busy so i asume this is a consession and nothing to do with the actual hotel as it looked popular. To stay here, well i wouldn't.. but if you want to make sure you get a very very good deal, this hotel is 50 a night standards yet charging 3-4 times as much.. Try the De Vere Cavindish on Jerymn St instead, it's cheaper, infinitly nicer, and a better location and you won't feel like you've been mugged when you hand over your money.And if you are thinking &quot;Oh but the view, it's opposite St James Park&quot;.. get that thought out of your head my c 240 stay would have had me in a room looking onto a fire escape at the rear of the building. take a photo.. stay somewhere else."
260,1258,"Dec 12 2005	Run-down and noisy	We stayed for a Saturday night at the hotel. Similar to other reviewers, we found the layout of the hotel entrance difficult to navigate in terms of finding the Reception. We stayed on the 3rd floor in a small, slightly over-cluttered room.The hotel appears to be passed its prime with a general spruce-up of the hallways and rooms badly needed.The doors of the rooms all slam automatically which negates the need of setting any alarm clocks or wake-up calls, as the continuous door-slams echo throughout the hotel from way too early.The walls are paper-thin so be prepared to unintentionally eaves-drop on your neighbors-for better or worse.The ''breakfast'' priced at  19.95 was very poor. We were left standing unattended for far too long before being seated and subsequently left unattended again. The quality of the delayed food was low and although the server did try to apologize, we were happy to depart and notch this hotel down as one to avoid in the future''"
261,1258,"Dec 5 2005	Down the Slippery Slope...	Like the reviewer before, we were upgraded to a nicer room because of my Starwood frequent guest membership. Actually, we were 'upgraded' twice. Our first 'upgraded' room scared us so bad, they moved us to another. I've stayed at the Park Lane many times over the years and agree with comments that the hotel is in need of attention. The great hall was nice, service there was very warm, as always. Business center is good. Location across from Green Park/St. James Park and proximity to nice restaurants, theatre, and shopping keeps returning us to the Park Lane. But it gets gruffer each time. With the price of London hotels what they are, the Starwood folks would be advised to put some money back into this property. Even loyal guests like ourselves may soon bolt."
262,1258,"Oct 12 2005	A bit past its prime but nice	We got an upgrade as Sheraton gold members, so no complaints about the room. It was a bit tired, as mentioned in a prior review, but incredibly roomy and nice. The Park Lane has a lovely bar, service was decent (althought the a.m. doorman has a bit to learn about how to treat guests), and is in a fantastic location. Not sure I would pay the prices to stay there (we used points), but it made for a great trip. Definitely a location that I'd stay in again."
263,1258,"Sep 28 2005	Great Location a little expensive	My wife and I recently returned from our first vacation to London. The Park Lane hotel was in a perfect location - not too far from the tube, which conveniently shares an entrance with the Marks and Spenser Store. From there, the Green Park station is on 3 different lines, so you can get almost anywhere fairly easily. For example, the trip from Green Park Station to Parliament was only one stop and took about five minutes. For those interested in walking, Buckingham or St James palaces are only about a ten-fifteen minute walk though the park. The hotel itself is one of those landmark hotels whose exterior looks a bit better than the interior. The front of the hotel also certainly looks more impressive than the back, which has a loading dock feel to it. The service was fairly friendly, although the staff were a little rushed and didn't pay particular attention to what customers were saying.We had an &quot;executive&quot; room with a king bed, which was fairly small by North American standards, but adequate. The bed was comfortable and was indeed king size. The bathroom had both a bath tub and a stand up shower, which was something we specifically had to ask for. Everything else functioned as expected. Overall, the room was clean and nice, but you're paying a premium for the location."
264,1258,"Sep 23 2005 	Great location but a little tired	I stayed at the Park Lane for 4 nights in late September. Overall I was quite happy with the hotel. The room was of typical size for a large city and included a new (but small) single bed, which offered a decent nights sleep. The bathroom was tired with a sink that blocked up regularly and a shower curtain that didn't quite close, but generally nice and clean. If you get dropped at the front of the hotel, you'll have to drag your bags through the lounge area and up a number of stairs to get to the reception area strategically hidden towards the back of the hotel. The staff were quite friendly and helpful. A request for an ironing board was accomplished in 5 minutes. Although I didn't eat at the restaurants I did grab some appetizers in the lounge area one morning and was amazed at the prices. I would recommend grabing a bite to eat at one of the many great restuarants a couple of streets behind the hotel or the yummy tapas bar around the corner on Down St (Pirata). Be careful if you order a mini-cab to get to the airport. I asked the night porter to arrange a cab for the following morning, but was told by the doorman when I went to check out that they don't do such a thing and that I must have been mistaken. Miraculously, he was able to summon a black cab at short notice and negotiate a deal with the driver which was 10 pounds more than the night porter had quoted. Overall a good hotel and a great location close to Buckingham Palace and Green Park tube - which is on the Jubilee line and handy if you need to get down to Canary wharf."
265,1258,"Sep 16 2005	Could not have been better!	We spent a week at the Sheraton Park Lane Hotel from the 5th to the 11th. We were extremely pleased with our choice. Our room was on the 7th floor overlooking Green Park, it was very spacious with high ceilings, a seating area, large marble bathroom with heated towel racks, and a mini bar. We have relatives in London and met them over tea every day in the Palm Court which is the hub of the hotel. We usually finished our day at the Palm Court with a drink and a snack, it is a very beautiful room but still very comfortable and relaxing. The service in all of the restaurants could not have been better. All of the waitstaff were attentive but not pushy. All of the help from the maids, concierge, front desk, bellhop, and doormen could not do enough for us and with great attitudes. The location is very convenient to everything with all kinds of transportation practically at your door. There is a great maze of pubs, restaurants and shops right behind the hotel in Shepards Market. We could not have enjoyed our trip more and will stay at the Sheraton Park Lane on all return trips!B Panzano"
266,1258,"Aug 26 2005	Tired but convenient location	Location is everything about this hotel- just a short walk from knightbridge and picadilly, and located right in front of green park, its great to stay here if you're merely using the room as a pit stop between tourist sites. Whats great is pret and starbucks is right around the corner, as is marks and spencers' grocery store. The rooms are a bit tired, and most of them face other buildings, so they're dark and dreary. The beds, however, are quite comfortable and I had a good night's rest each night. The breakfast is quite good as well."
267,1258,"Aug 20 2005	Charming hotel	We stayed at the Park Lane twice during a 3 week visit to England and France. We requested a triple, and I believe were upgraded to a junior suite. The front desk staff were uniformly friendly, and remembered us when we returned for our 2nd stay. We arrived early in the morning after a red-eye flight. We expected to leave our luggage and check in later in the day, but were told that the previous guest had just left, and that the room would be ready in an hour. We had breakfast and a wander around Hyde Park, and returned to check-in around noon.Our room was on the 7th floor, on the rear of the hotel. We had a rooftop view, and windows on two sides, facing west and north. Never checked for AC, as even though it was warm, the cross ventilation kept the room cool.We had a king bed, nice sitting area, a loveseat that was a sofa bed for our daughter, a desk area, two walk-in closets, and tons of room to stretch out. The bathroom was recently renovated, with a separate shower, deep soaking tub, bidet, two sinks and heated towel rack. Our only problem was the lack of a hairdryer. The solution was an extention cord. I realize the British electrical code is not the Sheraton's fault, but a plug to accomodate the hairdryer near the desk would have been a good idea!The location is great. We love taking the bus when we can in London, and could get almost anywhere either on the bus that ran on Piccadilly in front of the hotel, or on buses about a three minute walk on Park Lane. Green Park and Hyde Park Corner Tube stops are an easy walk, too. The Park Lane is an older property, so the rooms can vary in size. Remember, if you're not happy with yours, it doesn't hurt to politely explain to the front desk exactly what's wrong with it, and give them a chance to change your room."
268,1258,"Aug 16 2005	Not quite as good as you want it to be...	Here for an indulgent weekend stay in a five-star hotel. The Sheraton Park Lane suffers from having almost no rooms with anything equating to a view: the room they gave me, at the end of a dog-leg off a main corridor looked out onto a brick wall... Well, I suppose you don't necessarily go for the view....Reasonable size room, okay decor, as throughout the hotel, which gets away from the standard international hotel 'how many fabrics can we place in one room?' school of interior design. Think of it as 'period' rather than 'shabby' or 'in need of a make-over'.Great bathroom (marble-lined) with lots of hot water and (thank heavens) a separate shower cubicle rather than the usual shower-in-the-bath. Lousy reception on every TV channel, and last week's 'Time Out' doesn't over-inspire confidence, but lots of towel, toiletries and hot water, and the bed has to be one of teh most comfortable I've slept in....WiFi Internet access at extra cost via T-Mobile (standard T-Mobile rates), a change from other Sheratons I've stayed in where access comes free, in a hotel where the extras add up (3 for a mineral water that costs 50p in the nearby Marks and Spencer?). A great breakfast (the low-carb) at extra cost, even if the coffee pots don't keep the coffee hot for long, a small gym (cycles, treads and a couple of weights machines) helps work off even more pounds.Comfortable lounge areas add to the ambience, and you can't but feel a thrill when walking off Piccadilly into the Palm Court (taxis drop you round the less conspicuous back), but it's just that little bet less good than you want it to be: there's a habit of leaving odd pieces of crockery in the corridors which is particularly annoying (especially when the neighbours bring in Big Macs and a trolley-load of smelly wrappings stays outside their room for the best part of a day)."
269,1258,"Jul 25 2005	Good Locale Not 4 star service	I brought my family (husband, parents and 6 year old daughter) to London for the first time. I chose this hotel in particular for location and the fact that it was advertised as having air conditioning. It did but during the worse heat wave for years, the air conditioning failed. While this was not the fault of the hotel, their dealing with the situation left much to be desired. They made no effort to compensate us in anyway, an ice bucket and cold water were sent up to the room only after multiple complaints, no new fans were purchased and provided. As this situation went on for days, the staff had ample time to provide relief to clients and address the inconvenience proactively. In addition, I agree with other comments that the concierge was not very helpful nor had a good attitude. There was often no door man to help with getting a cab. We noted him only one time, on the weekend. The rooms are small in the European style, which was ok. Except that one of the rooms was supposed to be a triple (for two adults and a child) but they simply wheeled in a cot and fit it by the double bed. Now it was a regular size double room with very little walking space. There were two wonderful parts to the hotel. One, the location was excellent. Two, the Palm Court was an island of service pleasure. The Citrus restaurant was good and very friendly as well. I felt very welcome at the hotel with my young child. Indeed, her experience of having herbal tea in The Palm Court was something I will remember a long time.If I had visited with just my husband during a cooler week, I am sure that my reflections on the stay would have been much more positive. However, it is during times of difficulty that good service shines through and for this property, it simply did not."
270,1258,"Jul 25 2005	so so	The Park Lane Hotel clearly has seen better days, and we found it somewhat tired and in need of a refurbishment.On the plus side, the location is very central, and convenient for Buckingham Palace, the Victoria &amp; Albert and Natural History Museums, and Knightsbridge. The building has a good deal of character, particularly the lounge area, featuring huge comfortable sofas, and beautiful stained glass windows.Unfortunately, someone has taken their eye of the ball in looking after the hotel. The entrance foyer features some bizarre historical costumes, and outdated luxury goods mounted in display cases. I've never seen this in a hotel before, and as a first impression it makes you feel as if you're on a trip to Madame Tussaudes! The Reception is hidden away and somewhat hard to reach. Our room was quite small, and marred by an enormous mobile air conditioning unit which had been jammed in next to the bed, with a bulky hose venting air out of the open window. The weekend we went was very hot, however having this in the room seemed really out of place and took away from the ambience of the room.Needless to say it stopped working in the evening, and despite a lot of fiddling with the buttons we failed to breathe life into it. I think we should have complained really, but we couldn't be bothered.We also noticed a foldaway bed pushed up against a corridor wall that stayed there for two days running. This just reinforced the impression that a lack of care was being shown in running the hotel.On returning from a meal out on Saturday night, we relaxed with a cup of tea in the lounge. The tea service was superb, with silver plated utensils and ample quantities of red hot tea. We were very impressed with the antique silver strainer which was good fun! The service was also faultless.However, the ambience was marred by the house music that they were playing. It jarred against the setting, was too loud and too fast, and wholly inappropriate for such an austere old-fashioned hotel. I actually liked the music that they were playing, but some slow relaxed songs on a piano would have set the tone so much better. To sum up, this hotel has got the raw ingredients to be a landmark hotel, but at present, has clearly seen better days. It really needs a sympathetic refurbishment and a complete makeover to recapture it's past success."
271,1258,"Jul 19 2005 	Not too bad	Husband, 9 month old son and I had a ceremony to attend at Buckingham Palace and hubby gave me the task of booking a hotel. I spent many, many hours cross referencing various hotels to this website. Initially, I booked the Cavendish St James Hotel when I got a very good rate through precisionreservations website but a few days later I was informed that the room was not available. At the last minute (the day before checking in), I booked a room at a 'secret hotel' through lastminute.com. It wasn't really a secret as I did a google search based on the hotel description and location and knew it was the Park Lane. Although the reviews were so-so, I decided to go for this hotel because of the location. Following the London bombings, we decided to use as little of the tube as possible and we did walk everywhere in the end. We stayed for 2 nights - 12th and 13th July. Check-in was smooth and relatively quick. The room itself - a standard double which I got for 99 a night, looked classy but small. Basically a double bed with bedside table on either side, an armchair, a writing desk with chair. There was also a little portable A/C with a big hose hanging out the window. My husband said it was to suck the hot air out of the room. I switched that off before going to bed as I wanted to close the window to keep out the traffic noise. There was also proper A/C which kept the room at just the right temperature. I loved the closet. It was one you could walk into, had some shelves with a mini safe, and hangers to hang your clothes. There were also bathrobes. The bathroom was small but had a bathtub with a shower hose, toilet which hadn't been flushed properly, a sink with mirror, and a small magnifiying mirror.We didn't dine in the hotel. The nice lounge which we had to walk through to get to the main street (opp. Green Park) did smell of cigar. Overall, for the price we paid we were happy with the hotel."
272,1258,"Jul 19 2005	This place is AWESOME!	This hotel was superb. The facilities were excellent, and the hotel is located in the heart of London, the perfect place to be. From the welcoming agents at the front desk, to the housekeeping staff, to the room service staff, everything was perfect. The fluffy white bathrobes were more than inviting, and the towel warming rack was so welcomed after a long day touring.You can't go wrong staying at this A++++++++ hotel!"
273,1258,"Jul 5 2005	Not up to Starwood or Sheraton quality	June 23-25, 2005We were very disappointed with the service and the overall hotel. Our stay there was to be for 4 days. We changed locations for the last night. First we were given a room on the first floor and then changed two more times to finally a room on the Starwood Preferred floor-no view,just roof tops. We were without hot water for 2 days and the A/C was not very good. The prices were really out of sight, even in the bar. The concierge was not knowlegable or helpful. It was extremely difficult to get a cab at that location due to the other hotels getting all the cabs ahead of us down the street. The doorman would not even go out on the curb to try to flag a cab as the doorman at the Millennium Hotel next door did for his patrons. The metro station, even though it was just a few blocks away, seemed to be a very long walk at the end of the day. The main entrance to the hotel section is on Brick Street so you either had to walk around the block, or if you entered from Piccadilly(the main street) you had to walk through the lounge and bar to get to your room. The waiters in the lounge were rude if you were just sitting and not ordering. The one positive thing was the beds;they were the most comfotable beds. The hotel did refund one night's stay so that was a plus."
274,1258,"Jul 4 2005	Very Disaponting	We stayed at the Park Lane from June 17 - June 22. Having been to London for many years, I was looking forward to staying at a 5* hotel and great service. To my complete dismay my stay was anything but this. The service was terrible! The maid service barley makes the bed and if you are looking for more than your first morning cup of coffe using the coffee service in your room you will be disapointed. You must call constantly to get clean coffee cups and to have the coffee service re-filled. On our second day there, the air conditioning went out. I can understand mechanical problems but what is not appropriate is to be told by the Hotel staff and Management that it had been repaired and would be on in the next fifeteen minutes (for three days)Being a Starwood preferred guest I did not appreciate the run around and poor service received."
275,1258,"Jun 23 2005	The Hot Park Lane	Just got back from London and staying at the Park Lane Hotel in Green Park. The location of the hotel was awesome, across the street from Green Park, easy walk to Buckingham Palace, close to the underground, Piccadilly etc. The hotel was very nice too, except for the problem of no air conditioning for two of the 4 nights. The first room they gave us was an executive room - great on the 8th floor, even a slight view of the park but the A/C did not work so we went through about 2 more rooms before finding one that was relatively cool (an hour later). The manager was nice about it, gave us complimentary bottle of champagne for our trouble and the air worked the first night but then not the next two and it was very hot indeed. Manager was super nice but the concierge left ALOT to be desired. Besides attitude, the two different ones on duty were of very little help when it came to good places to eat, getting show tickets and when we inquired about the movie premiere (War of the Worlds) they told us it was not that night...we went to the theater anyway hoping to find it when it was going to be and stumbled upon the premiere - Tom Cruise and all! So, I did not think the cconcierge were very knowledgeable, helpful or friendly. The hotel definitely needs a facelift - which I think it is going to get - has a lot of character and charm - and again the location was awesome. Also, the maid service was not very good - our bathroom was barely cleaned every day -"
276,1258,"Jun 12 2005	Disappointed in service	I had booked an executive room, and was very pleased to see that is was a good size room, and well furnished, but with a very small TV for the size of the room. On checking in I noticed the windows were open, and had a blower with a large tube attached to it and with the other end placed outside the window, and cool air was coming in so I anticipated that the room was being vented for the time being. Upon my return later that night, the room was stuffy, and the unit was off, and the central air was not working. I notified the front desk, and they said that this unit in some of the rooms was the aircondition, and it was nothing more than a water cooler. I told them that this was not acceptable for a 4 star property not to have aircondition, and to have to have the windows open and allowing the street sounds to come in. A service man was sent up, and he was able to get the airconditon repaired, but it did not operate quite as well, as the air even at high was not as cold as well functioning aircondition. He informed me that his dept was not notified that anything was wrong with the aircondition, and on the other hand the front desk informed me that they were told the room was ready to be rented out, but was not told by house keeping that the aircondition was not working, and had brought in the water cooler. This service is not in keeping with the expectations of a Sheraton or a 4 star property as the closet door, and the bath room door had to be place touching each other or we could not keep it open.The room was clean, and the lobby small, but the bar area should have a non smoking area, as it smelled smoke all over."
277,1258,"May 31 2005 	Lovely room and comfortable bed!	My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Park Lane hotel for 3 nights in January. We paid 165 pounds per night. It was quite lovely and elegant and in a great location. We were upgraded to a renovated executive room, which was huge, with an extremely comfortable bed, his &amp; hers closets, a sitting area, and spacious bathroom with bidet, tub, and separate shower. Our room was right next to the elevator, but was very quiet. We were on the back side of the hotel, not facing Picadilly. Staff were very friendly and the concierge quite helpful with theatre bookings and train station/schedule information. We loved the very British character of the hotel. Tea is quite expensive at 20 pounds per person, no matter what you eat, but we chalked it up to the experience. We would definitely stay there again when it is just the two of us, but it would be a very pricey place to stay with kids. The Green Park tube station is only about three blocks away."
278,1258,"May 28 2005	Great Value - Smokey Lobby	This hotel is in a great location. The rooms are good sized - I sprang for a larger room and it was worth the money. I got a very good weekend rate. The beds and the bathroom were really clean and comfy. I would stay here again. The room was quiet and not a mile from the lift. Very nice.I would not have tea in the lobby again. My two femaile guest were disgusted when our tea was overwhelmed by cigar smoke - even though I had asked for a non-smoking table, I didn't get one and wasn't told. The tea was just as pricey as tea at other hotels in the area. We were eventually moved after complaining. But afternoon tea at a place like this should come with no hassles - period. Lovely room. OK food. OK service. Smoke almost everywhere. Tea and tension don't mix. Mom and the lady friend were highly annoyed."
279,1258,"May 22 2005	Park Lane London - Above Average	Stayed 5 days in April 2005. Like others, worried about the negative reviews. As a Starwood Gold, I called Starwood and requested a renovated room. No problems at check in. Just reminded them that I had requested a renovated room. Good room. Ave. sized for a London hotel. Great bed. Robe. No tea setup. Bath a little small with shower/tub combo, but just fine for one. Helpful, friendly doorman who suggested breakfast at Shephard's Market around the corner. Concierge very good. Called him from a cab twice for lunch reservations at different restaurants in London for business lunches and he came through just fine. Safe deposit boxes available. Be certain on check in that the cab drops you at the main entrance (which is not on Picadilly), especially if you have luggage. 2 blk easy walk to Green Park tube. T-Mobile wireless available throughout the hotel. It pays to get your T-Mobile account before you leave the US and then ask them how to access from the UK or elsewhere abroad. Much cheaper that way. Also T-Mobile available at all Starbucks, which seem to be on every other block in the UK. When my converter didn't work, they delivered one. It weighed about 10 lbs and was the size of a shoebox, but it worked. Would stay there again."
280,1258,"May 19 2005	High point of the trip	I enjoyed the hotel very much. We stayed in a suite on the first floor with a balcony and a view of Green Park. Although the hotel is old it is quite charming, well maintained and decorated and we found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The hotel is located right in the middle of everything, only a half-mile from Buckingham Palace and although it is probably a little pricey it should be noted that it is located in one of the most expensive neighborhoods on the planet. I consider our stay at the Park Lane to be the high point of our European vacation."
281,1258,"Apr 27 2005	Not really a 5* ...	I stayed in the Park Lane Sheraton Hotel from the 22nd to the 25th of April. I was expecting a real 5* hotel according to the Sheraton label it had. From the outside it just seemed like a typical London &quot;grand&quot; hotel. The first impression came from the fact that upon enterring there was no reception area, but rather a big hall. Then we had to cross a sitting room/bar and then after another door, we reached a small area and found the reception on the right. Apparently the &quot;main&quot; entrance was in a back street and not on Picadilly itself. After the (very) multinational staff handled some discussions with angry customers in front of us, we were assigned a room on the 1st floor. Upon reaching it, we discovered that the room was so tiny we could bearily open both our suitcases, and the &quot;view&quot; was to a very tiny courtyard. We went back to receptin and this time we had a room on the last floor with park view. That was the good thing. But the room was of the same size, but this time the bathroom was even smaller then the previous. Two adults couldn't be both inside, unless one was in the bath tub...The bed was small (and I'm a small guy...) but very confortable.I know it was supposed to be a standard room but I think Sheraton's standards went to low in this hotel.Anyway, if I had payed this room (which I actually didn't...) I would considered it a VERY bad deal, regarding the relation quality/price shown.For someone that knows Sheraton hotels in Portugal, this particular one was very disapointing. There surelly must have better hotels in the same price range in London. Look for them !"
282,1258,"Apr 14 2005	Would never go back again	Someone broke into my hotel room the first day of my stay. We carried all our valuable belongings with us so nothing was stolen, but it was still a very unpleasant thing to get after paying so much for the room.But credit goes to the staff for handling the situation well. Great location and excellent continental breakfast."
283,1258,"Apr 10 2005	Wonderful service and old charm!	After reading all bad reviews I was a little hesitant to book the hotel..however: me and my daughter spent 3 wonderful days at Park Lane Hotel. The room was oversized and we had a view over Green Park. The bed was the best hotelbed I ever slept in and I have stayed at hundreds of hotels worldwide. The hotel is old and it is not it perfect shape BUT it has charm and the staff was extremely helpful and nice and the location could not be better! The continental breakfast was very nice, but quite expensive, as it is in most hotels in London. Mrs. Camilla Lejon, Sweden."
284,1258,Apr 6 2005 	Not worth the money!!	Very dissapointing for the price and Sheraton quality. Bed was awful and old. AC vent was squeky and had to call for fixing. Bathroom heated floor was on despite the summer heat. Room looks faded and hallways smells a bit. Business center has nothing working. Poor value.
285,1258,"Mar 29 2005	Not worth the money!	Location was great and that was all that was good about this hotel. The room we stayed in was weird, old and not up the hype. The a/c didnt work and the entire floor was heated when it was already 75F outside. We were disapointed with the service staff who told you only what they thought you wanted to hear (not the truth)."
286,1258,"Mar 24 2005	Enjoyed our stay	My wife and I just returned from a fabulous vacation to London. I was nervous about staying at the Park Lane after reading many of the reviews on this site. However, we found our stay to be wonderful. The room we were in was what I would call an &quot;oversized king&quot;. They called it a suite. But, still, it was very spacious. It had a huge bathroom with marble countertops, a huge enclosed shower stall, and separate tub. The room overlooked Green Park. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The heated towel rack was a welcome bonus during a frigid February.We stayed six nights and got to know the ins and outs of the hotel. The staff was always friendly and helpful.The best part of the hotel, though, was it's location. It was ideal to be centered in London. You are two blocks from the Green Park tube stop. You can catch one of three tube lines there and be anywhere in Central London in a matter of minutes. Overall, I would give this hotel a huge &quot;thumbs up&quot;. Our final night in London was at the Rennaissance Gatwick (our flight was early the next morning). One night at that Rennaissance made us appreciate the Park Lane Sheraton even more."
287,1258,"Mar 22 2005	Nice tea rooms shame about the kettles	The Park Lane Sheraton is not a bad hotel. It has a lovely Palm Court for afternoon teas and late night drinks and it is very convenient. I had to stay at the last minute and I quite like collecting Starwoods points. The trouble was the reception staff were a little brusque and there were a few things that made it not quite as good as it could be - not least they were going to charge me 5 just to have a kettle in my room (they didn't charge me in the end because I pointed out that I'd got my own teabags!), but at that cost, you'd think it would be better. The faucets (taps) in the bathroom were stiff, the light bulb had blown, not major I know, but again, a little disappointing. The concierge was very helpful and all round it was an okay experience."
288,1258,"Mar 13 2005	Really nice London hotel	I just came back from the most comfortable five night stay at the Park Lane Hotel on Pickadilly. Don't listen to the complainers on this site, as I almost did. This hotel does not deserve the bum rap given it. This is a lovely, well located hotel with a staff that is anxious to please. All of the concierges were very helpful, they went way out of their way to help us. You can't beat its beds, they are by Sheraton, so are Sweet Sleepers and sooooo welcome after a long flight. Our room was very spacious, fresh and clean with a lovely luxurious feel to it. It slept three full sized people easily with one on a comfy pull out couch. We had no problems with room temperatures even though it was freezing outside. I was pleased to find that the hotel really was within easy walking distance of fabuous shopping, dining and the Green Park tube station. Walking to the legendary shopping around Mayfair and Bond Street was a pleasure and we even found walking to some theatres a possibility. Hop on/ hop off bus tours start at the Green Park tube station so joining a tour was simple.We were able to stroll over to Fortnum and Mason's for breakfast or tea before stopping in at Hatchard's, the peerless old bookstore next door to it. The Burlington Arcade and the Ritz are also nearby as is Buckingham Palace. Sometimes we ate at one of the charming places in the old Shepard's Market area which is tucked directly behind the Park Lane. It's a delightful warren of old, old buildings with interesting shops, restaurants and period pubs. The Park Lane is next door to the very pricey Atheneum Hotel and just down from the Japanese Embassy. It overlooks Green Park though I would suggest a room a bit back rather than overlooking the park, simply for peace and quiet as Picadilly is a main road for all its elegance. Even the best hotels can not silence sirens going by in the middle of the night.I would have no hesitation going back. My teenage son declared that he &quot;loved it&quot; and I would agree. My mother, age 85 who was with us, and I have stayed at some fabulous hotels in our times, in New York, London and elsewhere. This is a very nice hotel."
289,1258,"Mar 1 2005	Sheraton Park Lane Wanted to Charge Me for a Tea Maker	Stayed at this hotel last weekend for a two night stay. I noticed that the room did not have a tea maker. I called room service and was told that the cost for room service to provide a tea maker would be 5 pounds plus a delivery charge plus VAT. In addition if I needed the tea bags restocked the next day there would be an additional charge of something like 4 pounds. I had to talk to a manager to get this outreageous charge dropped. He actually tried to say that no London hotels provide tea makers anymore.The room itself was small and dim (60 watt bulbs, very difficult to read with them). The bed was comfortable and the location is nice but it is hard to recommend it."
290,1258,"Jan 29 2005	loved the park lane	My daughter and I have just returned from London and it was our pleasure to stay at the Park Lane. I had mixed feelings about whether I had done the right thing booking this hotel as only read the poor reviews after booking and paying as travel agent had said it would be very nice. We stayed for a total of four nights beforepicking up our tour to Europe and it was excellent in every way, comfy beds, beautifully appointed(standard room), great breakfast and close to the centre of london(10 minutes to Picadilly!!"
291,1258,"Jan 26 2005	Great location some great room/some tired	I stayed 4 nights in August 2004. The hotel location is great -- a few blocks from the Tube and walking distance to Piccadilly Circus and theatres.The staff is friendly and typically English.We spent 2 nights in a room that was quite tired and in need of renovation, though clean. It was of average size by English standards. We had some very noisy neighbors and were then switched to a really super room -- nice and newly decorated, and big and comfortable. This was frustrating for us since we are Starwood Gold and should have been upgraded to a better room from the start (the hotel was not full that week)."
292,1258,"Jan 25 2005	great location rooms are a mixed bag	just got back from 3 days there. When we arrived, the hotel was full and we were placed in a room that really smelled moldy, however, the personnel did a good job trying to fix the problem. The bathroom was very small and cramped. My husband is Starwood Platinum, so luckily the next day (when there was room in the hotel) we were able to be upgraded to a suite - which we were very happy with.Overall, as many people have stated, the hotel is in need of a renovation. But some of the fun is its art deco feel. The location is great and convenient to many things. One thing, if you want some quiet, ask to be placed on the back side (non park side) of the hotel - you might get an earful around pub closing time (that is unless they change it to the proposed 24 hr rule)....."
293,1258,"Jan 1 2005	The Good the Bad...and the Odd!	Just returned from four nights at the Park Lane. The GOOD I would say is the staff who we found to be very friendly and helpful and the fact that the location is fantastic. The BAD would be the rooms. Our room stayed unbelievably hot and the temperature control in the room did not work. We solved that problem by leaving our windows open. The bathroom was so small it was hard to maneuver in and the sink constantly backed up and took a long time to drain. The carpet was in need of replacement but the beds did have white down comforters which appeared to be new. As posted by others, the ODD part is that the back door is the front door which is quite strange but you CAN enter thru the main street entrance (if you are walking, not driving or riding) although you have to walk through the bar/restaurant area to get to the lobby and &quot;lifts&quot;. The hotel is very old and these problems exist because of of that so if you like old hotels and don't mind being without the best of &quot;modern conveniences&quot; then I can recommend this hotel. However, if you're looking for a four or five star hotel by American standards, I would look elsewhere."
294,1258,"Jan 1 2005	Wonderful staff - nice traditional hotel	After staying at the Park Lane on several occasions I feel that the hotel has received many unfair reviews and I feel obliged to provide my comments. I have found the staff at the Park Lane to be very helpful and friendly overall and, although some of the rooms are not up to the standard of some of the top 5 star hotels in London, I have found the Reception staff to be helpful when I was not totally happy the room assigned to me. The new Sweet Sleeper beds have greatly improved the quality of the hotel's beds and I am aware that there is a room by room renovation taking place which will hopefully help to erase some of the problem rooms other trip advisor readers have encountered. If you are expecting a brand new, modern 5 star hotel then I believe that the Park Lane might not be for you. On the other hand if you enjoy the atmosphere of traditional hotels with a comfortable and relaxed feel then I would recommend that you give the Park Lane a chance."
295,1258,"Dec 28 2004	Very disappointing	The Park Lane is in a beautiful location but once you enter the front door (which is oddly in the back) things go down hill. I was in a junior suite and the room bordered on dirty -- it was certainly dank. The bathroom was nice but otherwise the room was disappointing -- the bed was not as comfortable as to be expected for the price. Further, on one night the fire alarm went off in the hotel every twenty minutes or so. While a one-time technical problem is going to happen on occassion, what was unacceptable was the staff's reaction -- indifference. (No explanation or apology ever came!)I would not stay here again despite my loyalty to the Starwood program."
296,1258,"Oct 31 2004	Suites great standard rooms mediocre	One of the grand old London hotels, which still has its charm - a good location, the lovely oak room for drinks... But a small reception, surprisingly at the back of the hotel (so you have to carry your own bags through the hotel from the main entrance on the main road, Piccadilly, as there's no-one there to help) unless you take a cab and arrive down the tiny back street.I first stayed here in Sept as an 'ordinary' guest. Well, Starwood Gold status, but that didn't seem to count for anything - no upgrades offered. The room was mediocre - the shower didn't work, neither did the plug in the basin; the room itself was comfortable enough, but everything was on the old and faded side, and there was no view.And then I reached Starwood Platinum status, and my following two stays have seen me upgraded to suites. Both huge, beautiful, incredily comfortable - absolutely fantastic rooms.Overall, feels like the place needs some investment."
297,1258,"Oct 28 2004	Outstanding Hotel	During the last week of March 04, we (me, my wife, and my sister) stayed 6 nights in one of Sheraton Park Lane Hotels triple rooms. The accommodations were outstanding. Matter of fact, everything about this hotel was outstanding. Full breakfast was included with the cost of the room. The entire staff were extremely polite and friendly. The hotel is located on Picaddilly Street just across from Green Park. We were within walking distance of many locations (10 minutes to the nearest metro stop; 15 minutes to Picaddilly Square; 15 minutes to Buckingham Palace; 25 minutes to Westminster Abbey; and 3 minutes to the Hard Rock Cafe). We would definitely recommend staying at the Sheraton Park Lane Hotel."
298,1258,"Oct 22 2004	At best this is a 3 star hotel	I stayed at the Park Lane Sheraton for 3 nights in October. This is one of the worst Sheraton hotels I've ever stayed at. My room was a large executive corner room but it looked and was furnished more like a hospital room than a &quot;5-star luxury&quot; as it is advertised! The carpet was old and dirty, air-conditioning was not working, some of the tiles in the bathroom were dirty and broken, the TV set was small, and the furniture looked right out of a Days Inn! There is no lobby to talk about, only an old dark dingy bar with very expensive menu items!This is at best a 3-star hotel and not worth the price (I got a 3 for 2 deal at the Starwood but still end up paying about $300/night)"
299,1258,"Oct 22 2004	The worst 5 star hotel in london	One of my ambitions whilst on this mortal coil is to stay at least one night in every 5 star hotel in london.It was my great misfortune to choose 3 nights in this one.The room was stale,shabby,shoddy and some other word begining with an s.When the check out staff ask if I enjoyed my stay I would normally be quite neutral if I wasent happy(a very british trait) but on this occasion I just told the truth.The answer I got was that the staff had been told that a refurb was to take place next year.In all just not good enough.Sheraton should be bold enough to downgrade this place to a three star untill said refurb happens."
300,1258,"Oct 19 2004	Sheraton should be ashamed	My wife stayed here for 3 days - we had prebooked/prepaid on the starwood site - wish we hadnt - she looked at 3 different rooms all were awful, dirty and dingy - in the end realised we had thrown away the money so she choose to stay. The final room at least didnt have mould in it!! nor did it have a fridge just a hole where it should have been - what on earth is Sheraton doing with this piece of rubbish it reflects very badly on their brand - we gather from staff comments that sheraton is fighting with the actual owner/landlord so probably zero money being spent and boy does it show"
301,1258,"Oct 5 2004	Park Lane Home for the Infirm !!	I had the misfortune of staying at the Park Lane, but thank goodness it was for one night only. Wandering about the hallways of the fifth floor I was struck by a pungent stench that one would normally associate with the aftermath of a fire.The smell had permeated into my room and I suspect, everyone else's. The room !! how can I describe it... furnished like a council-run nursing home, except nursing homes probably have standards of basic cleanliness to adhere to.Filthy, Smelly, Shabby and Very Basic, a succcinct summary I'd say."
302,1258,"Sep 24 2004	perfect location and professional staff	perfect location for travels around london. lot of food and nightlife within blocks and the hotel is very nice. the staff was very attentive and warm. being a starwood platinum, my room was exceptional . It is a bargain compared to some of the hotels around the area, after all you are in the mayfair!!!..kudos to the staff and cheers"
303,1258,"Sep 19 2004	Great location lousy room	Stayed here on a weekend night in September. Can't beat the location but the room, oh, the room. Dingy, dank, drab and downright awful. Had a lovely view of the hotel's flat roof chock full of machinery and ventilation equipment making an awful racket, which dissipated -- along with any chance of fresh air -- only when I closed the double-glazed window. Bed was too soft and very uncomfortable. Carpet was stained beyond belief. I had an &quot;Endless Weekend&quot; package with a 10 p.m. late checkout. Reception disavowed any knowledge of the late checkout until I threatened to flash my confirmation notice. Watch out for surcharge on toll-free numbers from the room. It's 50 pence a minute! Sheraton should be ashamed to lend its name to this establishment."
304,1258,"Sep 18 2004	Better at B	Just finishing up a one week stay at Park Lane. Chose to stay here because this is my parents first and probably only visit to London, and desired the central location, and moreover, wanted the comforts expected from a paying 200 pounds or more per night.Very dissappointed. First off, Mattresses were horrible. They are apparently in the process of replacing, and we requested a different room and got one with a much better bed, but don't expect to need to do that.Further dissapointments insued. Promised included full breakfast was *not* included, because we had taken advantage of a sale on the Sheraton website. What a rip-off, the sale said nothing about reductions in normal accomodations!Heat control is completely broken off in our room. Doesn't work at all. In my parents room, they had to request a service person plane off the edge of their door, as they couldn't get it shut without slamming it. Carpets in room are very old and dirty. Our bed cover has cigarette burns. Numerous problems with bath/plumbing functionality. Overall, I've had much better experiences in London for half the price or less."
305,1258,"Sep 15 2004	Large room but dark and dingy	Stayed at the Park Lane Sheraton for three nights in May 2004. Although my room was quite large, especially for London, it was dark and dingy with the only window facing another wall of the hotel. Very poor lighting in the room, carpeting and bed covers appeared old and worn. No phone line at the only desk in the room, so had to sit on the bed to use dial-up for my computer. The front desk informed me that there was a flat fee for using dial-up, but it turned out that applied only when the access number to the ISP was a toll-free number. As mine was a local (London) number, imagine my surprise when I was hit with over 100 pounds in charges for internet access. Many better choices in London."
306,1258,"Sep 14 2004	Worst Sheraton Hotel	Can't believe Sheraton has this hotel. It's the worst hotel I ever stay at the Sheraton. Don't get fool by the outside, it should be rated less than 3 stars!!! Never again"
307,1258,"Sep 14 2004	an adequate choice	Our family of 3 stayed here Sept 3-8. I was quite pleasantly surprised, after such negative reviews, to find such a decent hotel. Overall I'd rate it adequate, not extraordinary, and we had very few problems.We stayed free on Starpoints. Oherwise I don't know what we would have done. London is EXTREMELY expensive, so I'm glad we didn't have to look into finding someplace cheaper. I tried to reserve for 3 and found out late that our reservation was for 2. To get a larger room which would accomodate a cot cost an upgrade 1,000 points and an additional 45 pounds. But it was certainly worth it. The confusion was my fault, not the hotel's.I was ready for the worst when I saw a huge stain in the rug in the reception area, but that was the last I saw of wear and tear. Our room was on the northwest corner so no view. But it was blissfully quiet, while the rooms facing Green Park probably are noisy all night, due to lots of motorcycles in town. The room and halls and common rooms seemed clean and well maintained. The housekeeping staff are all young Russiians. Even the machines in the exercise room all worked. Our room had central airconditioning, which we kept on. It was quite sunny and warm and very humid all the time we were there, and the A/C let us sleep well at night. A/C was very easy to adjust. My wife and son are allergic to mold, but there was not the least trace of it, even in the heat and humidity.The room was large enough that we could move around easily even with the cot in place. The bathroom was large and brilliant, with a huge shower separate from the bath. Lots of closet space, but not quite enough drawer space for the 3 of us.The location as noted is fabulous. The Green Park underground station is about 200 yards east, and the station is on the Picadilly line, which runs straight from the airport. We hauled our heavy suitcases on the train and up the stairs and escalators in the tube stations, and then it was an easy downhill roll along a wide sidewalk to the hotel. But the reception area of the hotel is in the back on Brick Street, which they don't tell you until you have lugged your suitcases up and down stairs and through the Palm Court. A simple sign at the front door would have been helpful.I choked at prices for small purchases through London, so we tried not to eat at the hotel. A continental buffet at 14 pounds and full breakfast at 18 pounds ruined my appetite. So we took a short stroll a few blacks east with all the well dressed young Londoners to the Starbucks and had a good breakfast for about 6 pounds. I actually preferred the Pret-a-Manger store right next to it, where there is a lot more choice. Right at the Green Park station in a large Marks and Spencer food shop, with a huge selection of lunch munchies and keep in your room goodies. One of the best features of the hotel location in its proximity to Shepard Market, an area of winding little streets packed with small international restaurants and pubs. We ate there 3 times, the Turkish being the best. There's even a Polish/Mexican place. That's London. An easy way into the maze is to walk north on White Horse Street, 2 blocks east of the hotel.All in all a decent place to stay."
308,1258,"Sep 3 2004	Pleasantly surprised...	Visited July 17-20, first time in London. I work in the hotel/hospitality industry and can be very picky. Booked our room and then stumbled across this website. Saw the previous reviews and was a bit hesitant, but stayed anyway. Upon arrival to the hotel at 8am, they pleasantly checked us in (we expected having to wait until later.) Our room was a bit small (and after seeing the fire escape floor plan on the back of the door - we were in the smallest room on that floor). However, still very manageable. The room was clean, nicely decorated, and the bed and its linens perfect. Bathroom was clean and stark (not a whole lot of decor.) Water pressure amazing. The bath robes &amp; towels were super thick and luxurious. We had a portable AC unit in the room that worked great, however, we ended up keeping the window open most of the time since it was pleasant weather. The view - non-existant. The location - THE BEST. Close to the Metro so you can be anywhere, anytime. Had afternoon tea in the Palm Court...server was incredibly courteous and the food great. It is an old building - so floors may creak, etc. - but I think that adds to the charm. Ultimately we enjoyed our stay and would go back."
309,1258,"Aug 24 2004	Still a good choice.	On my first night there was a power cut,[national grid failed] and then at 4.30 am all the fire alarms went off and this repeated every hour till breakfast. After this nightmare start the management refunded our room for that night and sent up fruit etc.As a frequent visitor to London i would recommend this hotel, it is in a perfect location, has lots of friendly staff and has clean and well presented rooms. The only downsides are the poor AC and the fact that not all rooms have a park view. Forget about the expense, this applies to every other hotel in the city;both the Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental are better but twice the price.A final note on our first night, on leaving our mini bar charge was waived and we received a letter when we got home explaining about the nature of the power failure. I thought the management did everything they could to make our stay pleasant and would stay here again."
310,1258,"Aug 8 2004	never again	i read the bad reviews but still stayed there a mistake! the un-view thru our window was a dead end courtyard with a mass of pipes and ventilation units. We were there in very late summer and it was warm . there was no a/c, with the windows open to the nasty courtyard no way of getting air from the outside in.We immediatly tired to switch our room the hotel was sold out and were exhausted wrom a long flight so were basically stuck. The location was very good but the Dickensian room for the $$$ we paid was not worth it."
311,1258,"Aug 4 2004	exists on past reputation	stayed 19, 20 july 2004. very disappointed. room dank, food in hallway for hours, lost our luggage,air cond barely worked, rug in room soiled. friendly staff, but could not get near front desk for check-out.this hotel needs new upgrades and managementIF you decide to stay here, see the room first. GREAT LOCATION........."
312,1258,"Jul 26 2004	Treated Royally	To be able to walk across the street to St James Park, stroll through the park and arrive at Buckingham Place...what a great location.Walking through the Palm Court made you feel &quot;regal&quot; yet comfortably at home. Breakfast at Bracewells offered wide variety with excellent service. Anne Mitchell was a delight, who upon seeing you for the second time, made you feel as if you were talking to an old friend.Our room was very comfortable, many amenities...from the spaciousness of the room to the heated bath towel rack and the luxuriously enveloping bathrobes. When calling room service, the phone was answered addressing you by name, making you truly feel as if the entire hotel staff was there to only service you.From reservations to checkout, thank you to the staff of the Park Lane for making my 15 year old's debut &quot;across the pond&quot; so special and memorable!"
313,1258,"Jul 24 2004	If it's free (with points) it's a good choice	After reading the reviews, we were concerned about our stay at the Park Lane, using Sheraton points. But we were given a nice size room with enough space for an extra bed and a good sized bathroom. All the criticisms about the hotel are valid -- but it all depends on whether you are paying for the room or not -- ours was free and it was well air conditioned and ventilated so we were luckier than a number of the reviewers. The hotel does need some refurbishment on the guest floors. The staff was prompt and helpful -- placing an extra bed (and linens) in the room immediately. The front desk was helpful but a little slow on the uptake; concierge was helpful. Location is terrific; food at hotel incredibly overpriced and not worth it....if you don't; care about being served, go 2 blocks north to the &quot;pret a manger&quot; chain and get a good breakfast for a fraction of the cost. Lobby (Palm Court) is NOT welcoming at all unless you are going to order drinks and smoke. CONCLUSION: great for a free stay; needs improvement if you're paying the high rack rate."
314,1258,"Jul 23 2004	Great stay and great way to use starpoints	We stayed here in April-2004 and had a great time. The trick to exchange Starpoints for expensive locations and pay money for inexpensive hotels (during promotional periods to earn extra starpoints). This is a category 4 hotel so we need 10k points a night for a regular room, but only 11.5k a night for a suite, which I gladly did. Starwood only require 1500 points to upgrade. Since I'm a platinum member, they upgraded us to a very nice suite overlooking green park and Buckingham Palace.This suite is one of the best rooms we've ever stayed at and we stay around 50 nights a year in hotels. The Park Lane's location is unbeatable. A short walking distance to Buckingham Palace and just 15 minutes leisurely stroll to Big Ben and London Eye. Rode the double-decker bus to Picadilly Circus and walked back to the hotel from there. No need for a car if you stay here. The regular rooms are kinda small but my friend did not experience anything negative. We came with small children and had no problems getting in and out with our strollers. You must request a park view room, if not the view of an alley could be depressing.The Park Lane is also a short walk to Nobu restaurant in the Metropolitan hotel. This is the best sushi restaurant in London by the most famous sushi chef in America, Nobu Matsuhisa.London is an expensive city and you get what you pay for. In this case we exchanged our 11.5k points for a room worth over $1000 usd. If you were to use 10k points for example The Westin Cancun, your exchange would've only been for $80 usd. That's what I call a smart way to use points."
315,1258,"Jul 19 2004	Great Location Bad for US $	We stayed here in early July and had a great time! Once we figured out that taking the Tube from Heathrow was fun, but a problem pulling luggage up Green Park underground stairs, we found the hotel a short downhill roll of the baggage. Only a 5 minute walk from Buckingham palace. (For some reason the Queen forgot to leave my name at the door for High Tea.) Beds, room, cleanliness, and service just fine. The bathroom was very clean, and the showers above average. There was a rather funny dehumidifier type of air cooling that was a portable unit that had to be used with the window open. It shut off automatically every 2 hours thru the night when it filled with water.By the second night I had it figured out so that I could empty the tray in the toilet so airconditioning would start again. Rather funny, but a small price to pay for the location.The price, however, is a shock to Americans. The room quality would have been 75 to 100$ or so in USA , but in London it cost $300/night with a 50% off coupon!The staff was excellent and we were able to walk a block for great sandwiches and coffee. The Tube makes travel around London very easy.We were prepared for the worst after reading the reviews, but were very happy with the hotel. I would gladly stay there again ( If we get Democrats back in the White House to improve the Dollar to Pound exchange.)"
316,1258,"Jun 3 2004	Not worth the $$	I stayed at the Park Lane Sheraton in February, 2004, and thought that the hotel was very overpriced for the room and service provided. Our room was tiny, the bathroom was drafty and the staff was rude and unhelpful. The location is great, but in the future I would rather stay at a more charming hotel, even if it is a few minutes farther from a tube stop."
317,1258,May 25 2004	Kept an open mind after reading reviews	I read all the reviews and still booked a room for our stay in early April. Our room the first night was just as bad as some people had written. No ventilation (there was a portable self contained ventilation unit) and the shower was not really a shower at all with no place to hang the hand held nozzle and only half a shower curtain. The staff was very accomodating and did give us a better room for the remaining 4 nights of our stay. A room with a real shower and bedspreads that were newer and a normal ventilation unit. After that we had no complaints. It was a good location and we were able to use Starwood points for a free night. We paid 132 pounds which included breakfast. I wouldn't stay there again unless I had a very good deal. Be careful on the free night. Breakfast wasn't included on our last free night using Starwood points and we got stuck paying $70 for a cold continental breakfast. Very expensive city. Harrods souvenirs are cheaper at the duty free shop at Heathrow than they are at the store. Wish I had waited.
318,1258,"May 1 2004	Sad that such a beautiful hotel has such horrid rooms!	I am a Starwood Platinum member and travel frequently. This hotel is in a great location and has beautiful common/public areas, but the rooms are HUGELY disappointing. First, they put me in a &quot;suite&quot; because I am platinum. Evidentally, they think bigger is better. The entire hotel needs a new HVAC system because it smells musty and moldy... which is terrible for me because I have allergies and asthma. Anyway the suite had nice square footage, but was in dreadful condition... wallpaper peeling off, paint chipped off on all the doorways, A/C in the living area was broken (they brought-up a fan, the bedding I swear was from 1984...dusty drapes, dusty, dirty! The whole room seemed dirty. I didn't sleep a wink. The next night (after begging for something which didn't smell musty!) they moved me to an &quot;Executive&quot; room which they claim had been renovated. Turns out, it still smelled bad and and had the same old dirty bedding and curtains, but the furntiture was newer. I guess renovation means newer furniture! I left after three nights with almost a full-blown cold...sneezing, coughing etc. Now, I am happily at another hotel. To me if you are on business in London, you want a decent place to be in the evenings and you need GOOD sleep! This place is old and dirty. I have one word for them ... RENOVATE!!! The location is fabulous though, with all the Shepherd's Market restuarants and Pubs around the corner."
319,1258,"Apr 16 2004	Overall OK	We stayed at the Park Lane Hotel in early April. First of all, the hotel is in a great location if you are there to sightsee. It is within very close walking distance from Hyde Park, Green Park, Buckingham Palace, and the Westminster (Big Ben) area. There is also a tube stop (Green Park) a few blocks away so getting to areas such as the Tower of London, Notting Hill, or Kensington is not a problem at all. Frankly, that is the most important to me, since I was not there to hang out in the hotel bar and spend hours upon hours in my room. Secondly, the staff is overall very friendly, especially the concierge and the bellhops. They knew the city well and were able to provide good recommendations and advice. The hotel inside is attractive, but didn't seem to be very busy. The lobby is somewhat smoky (to be expected in Europe I suppose), but seems to be popular for afternoon tea (albeit very pricey, especially for those spending the equivalent of American dollars). Our room was good, nothing spectacular, it was a bit stuffy, but that was easily solved by opening a window, it was small by American standards, but as long as I can sleep there and open my suitcase, who cares how big the room is? I didn't see any peeling paint, our furniture seemed good enough. So overall, a 4, as nothing really wowed me and perhaps it was expensive for what you get, but nothing was overly bad and the location was tough to beat."
320,1258,"Apr 7 2004	look elsewhere	stayed here at the end of march 2004. i was expecting more from this hotel and was not impressed with it at all. the entrance is in an alleyway behind the main drag, and when we did go in to the hotel from the main street, we had to pass through the lounge area. not very convenient for us. the room was overlooking green park, which was nice...but inside, the carpet right outside the bathroom was soaking wet, and the bathtub veneer was peeling. not so nice.this hotel is ok, but not for the price, and it shouldn't be considered a 5 star property. i've stayed in nicer 3-star ones."
321,1258,"Apr 6 2004	What a dump.	Normally I love Sheraton Hotels. That's how I accumulated the Starwood points I redeemed to stay at the Park Lane Hotel on a recent vacation to London. I was, however, extremely disappointed in this hotel. The lobby is gorgeous (although very smoky), and the service was exceptional, but our room was simply disgusting. It was dark, it smelled musty, the carpet looked old and dirty, and the furniture reminded me of the Fayetteville, NC Four Points Hotel in which I stayed 3 years ago. The bathroom was a joke. The paint around the pipes was peeling off. There was nowhere to put anything and there was nowhere to hang towels by the single sink. The shower had good water pressure, but the water temperature kept fluctuating (picture scalding hot water whenever someone flushed the toilet). The room had a relatively large closet - too bad we couldn't see anything inside it because the light was so dim. There were dead flies in the ceiling light, and live ones flying around the room waiting to join them. The only good things about the room were the towels and bedding. The sheets were obviously very high quality sheets, the blanket was 100% wool, and the pillows were soft down-filled and huge. Too bad the bed was as hard as a door, and our &quot;double&quot; bed consisted of two twin beds pushed together and covered with a sheet. The join of the two mattresses made it feel like we were sleeping on a pull out sofa bed. All this, and the rack rate of 330 GBP (well over $600 at the current exchange rate), or 10,000 starwood points a night. What an absolute insult."
322,1258,"Apr 6 2004	Not a 5 star hotel !!!!!!!!	The hotel was nothing like a 5 star hotel. The service was terrible, and the facilities were in poor repair (only 1 elevator was working for the entire hotel much of the time). Considering I paid over $13K for a standard room for the 3 weeks I was there I was not at all impressed! If this is a 5 star hotel I do not want to stay at a 3 star!"
323,1258,"Apr 2 2004	5-stars???	This hotel is good, but I would not consider it a 5-star hotel. Its location in Mayfair is absolutely great. However, don't be deceived by the hotel's name...it is actually not located on Park Lane. The hotel's entrance is 2 small blocks from Park Lane (on Piccadilly, right in front of Green Park). The rooms are a bit dated and not as clean as you would expect a Sheraton room to be. In short, I don't think this hotel is worth the regular rack rates!!"
324,1258,"Mar 23 2004	great location room not so great	Visited London in February. The hotel appeared very nice upon arrrival. Very friendly staff. Went up to the room and was very disappointed with it. We had a package deal through Virgin Atlantic and it was apparent that we were given an inferior room. The room had not been modernized in many years. Torn wall paper, paint on the curtains, caulk missing around tub, very old carpeting, damaged furniture etc. For our first experience at a 5 star hotel I can tell you this room was no better than a 3 star. The hotel staff was nice and breakfast was great. I would not stay there if visiting again. I am sure I could find a nicer place for the money. I would suspect those who have given a favorable response stayed in the rooms shown on their web site. I can assure you my room did not resemble any of those rooms in the slightest and I suspect that all of us who travelled with a so called discount group were relegated to the worst rooms.The best thing about the hotel was location."
325,1258,"Mar 13 2004	A ""historic"" hotel	Historic hotel in a good location 400 m from Buckingham Palace. Last renovation of rooms probably 20, 30 years ago. If you would like to know how they lived here 30 years a go, this is rthe place to go. The bed was unbelievable short and unsuitable for anybody taller than 1,7 m. Hard to believe that the rooms meet the quality criteria of Starwoods."
326,1258,"Mar 8 2004	Christmas in London	Just around Christmas, my husband and I took our two small children on a trip to London, and we thoroughly enjoyed the Sheraton Park Lane and received very special attentions as guests. We were allowed to look at a couple rooms to see if they would be acceptable becauseour initial room was smoky. In addition to that, the conceirge wasextremely helpful. I cannot even to expalin how wonderful Full English Breakfast was (which was included) each morning. Very excellent service in the dining room. This is an overall excellent hotel which is beautiful and well maintained. It is in a superb location, and I would certainly return there for any future visits to London. I must admit that I was a little bit nervous given the reviews on Trip Advisor, but I was pleasantly surprised by this historic and lovely property."
327,1258,"Feb 16 2004	Beautiful historic hotel	This is a beautiful hotel. It is quite historic and has a great location. I was a little worried from some of the reviews, but people who understand other cultures realize standards (size of rooms, styles) are different. The service we received was excellent, the room overlooking the park spacious for a large city and the staff was very helpful. We enjoyed our stay tremendously due to the quality and location of the Sheraton Park Lane. We highly recommend it."
328,1258,"Jan 31 2004	Perfect location excellent place to stay!!	We spent 8 nights at this hotel in mid January 2004 and we couldn't have been happier with the service we received. We were surprised when we arrived to see that they had set up an extra bed in the room for my toddler because we hadn't requested it since their website stated they would charge extra per night for the extra bed. We were not charged extra and my daughter was thrilled to have her own special bed. The concierges were fabulously helpful with all of our needs from giving us directions to setting up a babysitter. By the way, the babysitting service they provide is above and beyond what we expected. They use people who work in the hotel (who they obviously trust) to babysit and they don't overcharge for the service! Our room was kept spotless during our entire stay and while in the room we were thrilled to realize that we couldn't hear a peep from the other rooms. Once during our stay we decided to *experience* afternoon tea at the hotel and even though we didn't have reservations we were cordially shown to a comfortable table in the middle of the room so we could admire our surroundings. We would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this hotel to other vacationers."
329,1258,"Jan 26 2004	NOT a Five Star Hotel	I stayed in this hotel in January 2004 and was not at all impressed. I booked it on expedia for about $200/night. Expedia claimed that this was a five star hotel. I was most definitely not a five star hotel. The lobby was nice and the staff a bit stuffy but pleasant, but the room was pretty darn awful. If the ratings went by the room alone, this would have been a three star hotel at best. The room always felt damp (even though it was the middle of January). I think it is beacuse there is no ventilation system at all. In addition, the carpet was old, worn, and dirty. Same with the walpaper. It just had a very old look and the whole room desperately needed a deep cleaning. Bedding was old as well. It just didn't feel clean. I have stayed at another hotel in London that claimed to be five stars (the Howard--Swissotel), and that hotel was MUCH cleaner and newer. It was a bit more expensive but worth it. The only good thing about the Sheraton Park Lane is the location. It is very close to the tube (I would say three blocks). It is also close to a grocery store and a Starbucks. The location is very safe. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the place unless they renovate all the rooms."
330,1258,"Jan 17 2004	Bad!	We spent 5 nights here. I would not ever go back. Very disappointing. Lousy hotel. Needs to be totally renovated. Uncaring staff, lousy unfriendly concierges. The only thing nice was the location. Next time I'll stay in another hotel in the same area. Stay elsewhere!"
331,1258,Dec 11 2003	Not what we expected	The hotel was OK... nothing special. Glad we used our Starpoints for a hefty discount otherwise we would have been quite disappointed by the hotel and the service. Reasonably convenient - although we will not be going back again.
332,1258,"Dec 2 2003	had to upgrade	great location (walking distance to many of the major sights &amp; hot spots) overlooking a beautiful park with nice, helpful staff. we got a discounted rate on the standard room but had to upgrade to an executive room for an extra $75/night. the upgrade was absolutely worth it, but the total price was not (definately not worth the rack rate). the original standard room we checked into was old and smelled of mold. the bathroom had cracked tiles, moldy shower curtains, a chipped sink, and a dirty floor. the sleeping area was nice with a large walk-in closet but the bathroom made it necessary to leave. the executive room was spacious, well lit, with better furnishings and had a nice, modern, and clean bathoom (separate shower and tub and dual sink countertop). this room also had a safe which came in handy."
333,1258,"Nov 23 2003	OK Hotel not worth Rack Rate	Upon Arrival I was shown my room and was not impressed. The Room was old and smelled stale. (not antique but old--chips in the bathroom tile, rips in bedspread) The management was kind and tried to find me a better room but the hotel was fully booked. The Concierge on the other hand was very helpful. He lined up some great tours for me and found some great restauraunts in Sheperds Mareket for me."
334,1258,"Oct 4 2003	Not worth it	First - let me say that I am a Starwood Platinum member and stay at Starwood Resorts over 60 nights a year (US and international). This is by far the worst one I stayed at.To start - the room was a large suit consisting of two rooms - both were very worn and smelled stale. I mean - it was ok for a 3 star or so, but that's about it. The AC was basically a very light fan that only worked in one room - I know other rooms didn't have AC or it just didn't work at all. I will give very high marks to the bathroom though - which was huge, modern and worked great.The location is Great ! in very safe place, very close to tube (like 3 blocks) and we just walked to a lot of shopping and sights.The Staff is really bad - very unhelpful. I see a lot of other reviews here that say the same thing - it was very true. The conceirge was almost funny in how unhelpful he was - no effort or care - and other staff members were not much better. The common areas are very stately and very nice however - I just had very bad experiences with the staff in these areas.I guess I would say that if you are actually paying full rates - it's just not worth it - you can get nicer places with nicer staff. If you are using points or a very discounted rate - it may be worth the chance. However I know I won't use my money or points here again."
335,1258,"Sep 20 2003	Great Stay in early September	My husband and I stayed at the Park Lane for five nights after winning a bid on Priceline. It was my first time using Priceline and it worked great. We were given a nice room on the 4th floor with twin beds (we requested twin or king) and nonsmoking. Although we didn't have a view of anything other than a courtyard--it was nice and quiet and the window opened for fresh air. There was air-conditioning contrary to what other reviews said. Each room was comfortable and quite large. The bathroom was quite large, the shower good, and the hot water plentiful. The room came with an honor bar but i called down and asked them if I could use it for personal items and they sent housekeeping up and cleaned it out. I was able to use it all week that waywhich is nice with the little market down the street. it was an excellent location across from the park and close to the Green Park tube. Housekeeping was great and the room condition was quite acceptable. I would stay here again and recommend this hotel to others."

1,1264,Scammed by the Front Desk	When we asked at the front desk for a restaurant recommendation we were sent to a place that overcharged us and was completely shady. When we told the manager what had happened he was not apologetic or sympathetic. There was some kind of kick back or connection going on.
2,1264,"excellent location	Stayed for one night only. Location is perfect, just 300 meters from Harrods and all the nice restaurants and shops nearby. It is also close to the underground so it is easy to get around.Breakfast is superb, only complain is the elevator. We had to wait for a very long time, so we used the stairs. The bed is nice because of the matress and duvet. Woud definately go back."
3,1264,"Nov 10 2009 	Good location and good breakfast	Good location, close to South Kensingston tube station and directly opposite the V&amp;A museum. Breakfast very good. Had evening meal on our first night, which was a carvery, no other choice offered on any evening. Stayed for 6 nights, after 2 sleepless nights due to noise from the airconditioning we asked to be moved from Room 645. Still heard noise in Room 668 but was acceptable. Would stay in this hotel again but not on the 6 Floor."
4,1264,"Nov 1 2009 	wonderful room and great location	This was our first stay here and we found the room to be excellent, bath spacious and clean. The full English breakfast was wonderful. I would certainly stay again and recommend it to all others!"
5,1264,"Nov 1 2009 	Fantastic in places	Room was beautiful and there was a even a surprise in the room. Check in was swift so was check out.Breakfast head of tables is arrogant and the waiting staff rushed off their feet, when I asked for a pot of coffee i got a cup full slopped in front of me, when I asked for an actual pot of coffee and some cutlery I was given a how dare you look which made me &amp; my friend uncomfortable. Would recomend the hotel to friends but they need to sort their staff out as their customer service is shocking..."
6,1264,"Oct 31 2009 	Could do better	I have stayed several times at the Rembrandt over the years and its a bit hit and miss with the rooms. This time it was a bit of both, the room was OK with the exception of the bed it was just too small and neither my wife or myself are large people. She slept fine but I felt like I was on the edge of a cliff and kept waking up. They also do not seem to be able to fix the heating its either on full or not at all, this time we had to have the air conditioning on in October. Service was good but would help if the staff could try to smile. Food was OK. I do like the bar/lounge area it does have a comfy feel to it. My tip is if you are staying ask for a room with a large queen the double beds or at least in my room were too small. The location is ideal with South Kensington tube station only a five minute walk away and the V&amp;A museum across the road."
7,1264,"Oct 15 2009 	Good Value Excellent Location	I was searching for a hotel that was well placed for business and lesiure as I was travelleing with my partner. I find it impossible to find a hotel on TripAdvisor that has great reviews all the way and is still inexpensive. But, the Rembrandt is different. True, the rooms are not enormous, but that is the case with London hotels. I had room 474 at the back and it was very quiet - if noise bothers you, make sure you ask for the rear/central facing rooms. The bathroom was new and in excellent condition - Grohe taps/shower and Roco fittings all make for a luxury feel. The location is perfect - RIGHT opposite the V&amp;A, close to shops like Harrods/Harvey Nicks etc and 5 mins from the tube and Natural History/Science Museums and access to the park sof London less than 15 mins walk. The room was 130 including breakfast. We ate breakfast which was a buffet and had a wide range of options. I also had lunch which was well attended too. Internet access is now included for most bookings - so the hotel is listening to the comments of the past.Really, no complaints and I'd return again."
8,1264,"Oct 12 2009 	An excellent hotel great location very good price for London	I stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend for three nights as part of a sight seeing trip to London. We booked an Executive Room on Expedia for 135 per night including breakfast. Upon arrival we were checked in quickly and then went to our room which was very nice indeed. I had stayed at this hotel a few years earlier and can honestly say that the refurbishment has transformed the rooms to being very modern and very cosy. Some of the Executive rooms have jacuzzi bath so if you want one, drop them an email and they'll do all they can to reserve one for you (they did with me!)Breakfast was a solid affair with everything under the sun you could possibly want! We never went hungry and food was of a high quality. Overall, highly recommended and a one that I shall definately return to."
9,1264,"Oct 10 2009 	Good Hotel in a Great Location	This hotel has a great location in South Kensington. It is a 5 min walk to the Tube and to Harrods.The updated bathroom was the highlight of the room. Good breakfast buffet, but coffee was a little slow in coming in the morning.A 1 am fire alarm provided a bit of an unwelcome distraction one evening, but they had us back in our rooms within 30 min."

11,1264,"Oct 5 2009 	Great Location	Stayed here 4 nights. Very quiet, room updated, clean, comfortable. The rooms were large and spacious---a big bonus in Europe. Breakfast was excellent---good variety and the food was fresh. Staff was helpful and attentive. The location was perfect for touring London---a few minutes walking distance from the Tube station. Directly across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum. We enjoyed our stay and would chose to stay here again."
12,1264,Oct 1 2009 	Great location and good hotel	Good destination in knightsbridge. Hotel well presented - stayed here many years ago and the whole place has been upgraded substantially.
13,1264,"Sep 29 2009 	What a pleasant surprise-it was just as advertised and more	What a pleasant surprise-it was just as advertised, and moreWe spent 7 nights at the Rembrandt was loved it. Our upgraded room was comfortable, stylish and spotless. We were in the front on the 5th floor and there was almost no street noise and NO hotel noises-was amazingly quiet. The bed was fantastic, linens quality and the bathroom (with Jacuzzi) was a wonderful place to return to after a long day of urban hiking. The breakfast was of excellent quality and plentiful. This was important since the exchange rate in the UK was not in our favor and we ate so well for breakfast that lunch was a smaller affair. Everything at this hotel was with a full hand from the apples in the lobby, to the breakfast waiter to watched to make sure I poured from the correct (decaf) carafe to the concierge who printed our boarding passes. We felt taken care of-it was truly a vacation.What a surprise, something that not only looks like it does on the internet, but is even better. This is only the second time that's happened to us."
14,1264,"Sep 24 2009 	Great hotel	We found The Rembrandt an excellent hotel. The buffet breakfast (included in the price of the room even though we had the lower priced room) was outstanding. The staff was very cordial and efficient. The concierge was helpful with directions and with scheduling tours. The room was clean, comfortable, bright and ideal. The location was convenient to The Tube (about a 10 minute walk), bus stops across the street, and other sites we planned to visit. We would recommend this hotel for a business stay or vacation."
15,1264,"Sep 23 2009 	Excellent Hotel with Great Location	This is an outstanding hotel within easy walking distance to Harrods Department store and Bunch of Grapes Pub, one of the best Pubs in London. The staff is friendly and helpful. The place rates four stars. The breakfast buffet was excellent with multiple choices from lite to full (sausage was wonderful:) ) The bar area and lite eating area was spacious although the service was spotty. The cold draft beer was excellent (try the blonde 1664). The room we had was small and the definition of queen defines the American double bed with little room to roll around without bumping into your partner. I would ask to see the available rooms,but this hotel was fully booked when we were there and this may not be possible. This was originally Harrods luxury hotel. I recommend this for a delightful stay in London"
16,1264,"Sep 15 2009 	Convenient and comfortable	Across the Road from the Victoria and Albert Museum, and close to the other South Kensington Museums and Knightsbridge shopping, this hotel is 5 minutes walk west to South Kensington underground station and then 20-30 minutes to the centre of London and the City. Rooms are comfortable and air conditioned, but the bathrooms are tiny. Rooms at the back are quiet. A good breakfast buffet is offered. For dinner, it is close to a range of restaurants around South Kensington, or - going east - Knightsbridge. Somewhat pricey, like most London hotels."
17,1264,Sep 12 2009 	London Visit	The rooms are really not very clean looking although the bathrooms are not bad. But it is really small. It is a hotel only good for a night if you are just passing by London or last minute reservations.The carpet is really dirty makes you feel not comfortable in the room. They have a pool but they have a charge for the hotel guest. This really suprised me because there is no mention of it in the internet.
18,1264,"Sep 8 2009 	A very good choice	We stayed at the Rembrandt one night between coming off a cruise ship and flying home to Atlanta the next day, The location is excellent, across the street from the V&amp;A, and a short walk to the Natural History Museum, the Albert Hall, and South Kensington Tube. Good restaurants within 5 minutes walk are too many to count. Check-in was easy, and the concierge arranged for our transportation to Heathrow the next day before we went up to our room.We had splurged and booked a Grand room, with a nice advance booking discount: The room was immense by London standards, with a king-sized bed, a seating area with a a sofa, 2 armchairs and a coffee table, a full-sized desk, and large wardrobe. Immense bathroom, fully appointed, including very thick terry bathrobes. Bed extremely comfortable. Rooms at the front of the hotel may have traffic noise from Thurloe Pl/Cromwell Rd, but our room at the back of the hotel did not. There wasn't much of a view, but we prefer quiet to a nice view. Internet access worked fine in the room, and the hotel had satellite television in at least six languages.The Rembrandt's Palette restaurant serves an excellent buffet breakfast in the mornings, which is included in the room tariff, and operates as a carvery for lunch and supper. While we did not eat supper there on this trip, another couple we met during the cruise are quite familiar with the Rembrant and cited the Palette as offering excellent value for lunch or supper in London. The quality of the food and service at breakfast was high, and I would expect something similar obtains at lunch and supper. While we did not make use of the Rembrandt's lounge bar, it is elegant and roomy and would be a good place for a comfortable round of cocktails with friends.On the whole, we were quite satisfied with our stay at the Rembrandt, and will almost certainly stay at this hotel again on future trips to London."
19,1264,"Aug 15 2009 	Something of a dump	Through a BA deal, stayed here for two nights free. The hotel was worth what we paid for it. Rooms are rather small, though not tiny, but badly in need of renovation. Carpet looked like it hadn't been replaced in 40 years, very dirty at the base of the walls where a vacuum cleaner couldn't reach, and the furniture was battered by similar decades of use. The room was airless -- no a/c and a window that could be opened a couple of inches kept the room unpleasantly hot at night even when the outside temperature was in the 60's. The breakfast was poor to mediocre. Most people staying at the hotel appeared to be young or with small children, tourists looking for relatively inexpensive accomodations. On the plus side, the hotel offers free internet which worked very well, and it is well located directly across the street from the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and only a couple of blocks from the South Kensington tube stop. To be fair, we probably got a bad room because of the BA deal but I have to assume that many other rooms are in similarly poor condition. Wouldn't stay again even for free."
20,1264,"Aug 13 2009 	perfect location	I had a nice stay in this hotel with my wife + children (11,12) at the start of August and found the hotel a perfect location. Within a 15 minutes walk of the hotel you have the science museum, Victoria and Albert museum, National history museum and Hyde Park which are all great and free (kids loved them all). The Royal Albert Hall is also in this radius and is 5 for a tour per head also good value. Harrods and Harvey Nichols are also a 10 minute walk in the opposite direction. Nearest tube station is South Kensington which is a 5 minute walk.The rooms are very clean and tidy with all modern features &amp; flat screen televisions. The rooms that we were in 669 + 671 were adjoining and both had whirlpool baths which great for relaxing in after pounding the streets.Breakfast was also very good with more than enough for selection. only small fault was cereal; area was hidden away with no signs to show where it was.Staff were excellent as was the manager - sylwester - who we had to see about a small problem with our room which he dealt with very well.This Hotel is excellent value and we will definitely be staying there on our next visit to London.We actually stayed in another hotel which was more Central and expensive for 2 Nights but it wasn't as good as the Rembrandt.. I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in London for all age groups"
21,1264,"Aug 10 2009 	Good value excellent location not so great breakfast	The Rembrandt is a nice hotel, in a great location in South Kensington close to Harrod's and Knightbrige and with a tube stop nearby for everything else. The rooms are large, with nice beds, toiletries and free w-fi. The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly. It is impossible to book a service at the spa . The pool is next door but you have to pay to use it. The hotel does not have enough tables at breakfast and we often had to wait, whatever time we came down. Staff did not replenish breakfast food regularly and seemed overwhelmed with serving tea/coffee."
22,1264,"Aug 9 2009	Wonderful Location Great Stay	To reiterate what has already been written, the location is wonderful. Close to the underground (about 10 min walk with my mother) and a 15 minutes walk to Harrods. Many restaurants, shops, museums, grocery, and chemist within a short walking distance. Plus for those taking the double-decker tour bus (Big Red Bus) stops very close to the hotel. The room was comfortable, Executive Twin. The view was terrible, but we didn't travel to London to look out the window - correct? There's tea/coffee service in room and an iron and pant press. There is also an in-room safe and free internet service in the rooms. Our plane arrived at 7:30am and we were at the hotel at 8:30am. They graciously held our luggage and told us to come back at noon for a room. When we walked back in at 12 the room was ready. Great! The breakfast was nice, a lot of selection (meat, eggs, potatoes, fruit, bread, cereals, and vegetables). It was a nice way to start each morning off touring. Overall, the friendliness of the front desk was good - not overly nice but not rude. The hotel felt comfortable and extremely safe - which is important when traveling with your mother. I will defiantly stay at here on my next visit to London!"
23,1264,"Jul 31 2009 	Excellent value for money for central hotel clean with pleasant staff	This hotel was excellent value for money. Situated opposite the Victoria and Albert Museum. We stayed for one night whilst attending the Proms, walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall. Executive room was very large and clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Were able to leave our bags after we checked out for safe keeping which enabled us to visit other places the next day.Would definately stay there again and recommend it to others. Only hope they manage to keep it the way it is and do not start putting the prices up due to the excellent ratings it appears to be getting!!"
24,1264,"Jul 24 2009 	Brilliant hotel and good location !	Room clean and tidy. plenty of sockets and iron plus ironing board in large wardrobe.Bathroom had whirlpool bath! (great!) and the usual shampoos and soaps. We only ate the buffet breakfast which was okay as well although the toasting machine was a weird contraption, cereal hidden by the entrance. Staff attentive even when breakfast room was busy. Didnt dine in Palette Restaurant but asked staff if i could view the menu and i was taken into dining room where the chef happend to come out and told me about the carvery which was roast beef or pork. Looked lovely although we decided to eat elsewhere.The bar served a wide variety of drinks and cocktails, a good few of the cocktails were sampled and all good!The location was the best if you wanted to shop or even just window shop.5 min stroll to Harrods and a couple more to Harvey nichols. Harrods is lit up at night - nice pictures. We ate at Khans near S.kensingtion tube and a small italian near the hotel - cant remember its name but next to an old dusty bookshop.Also, theres lots of museums near-by the Natural History Museum is free .Next to that is the Science Museum and the V&amp;A is practically opposite the hotel. For the money we paid this was a definate winner ."
25,1264,"Jul 22 2009 	clean courteous staff and worth a return visit.	we had this booked for three nights including breakfast in a superior double. on arrival we were informed we had been upgraded to executive at no extra charge. the hotel was 5 -7 mins walk away from south kensington tube station (with luggage) and about 5 mins walk from harrods and directly opposite the V&amp;A. the staff were always very friendly and courteous. the room, although a small executive, was clean and quiet and the bed was comfortable. the usual selection of beverages but water was extra from the minibar in the room. also in the room was an iron and ironing board, room safe, freeview tv (with the usual pay channels) strangely no radio, that was in the bathroom which was well appointed with bathrobes and good quality toilet paper and toiletries. breakfast was a buffet affair and a slight let down, toast you did yourself, thin bread which had to be put in twice to give it any colour despite my wife fiddling with the controls. the fried eggs were either underdone or over done and the porridge tasted as if it had been made using water instead of milk, however, there was a good selection of fruit, yoghurts, bread rolls and croissants as well as fruit juices and cereals. you could help yourself to as much or as little as you liked and coffee or tea was served to you at your table. the hotel has an adjoining health spa and fitness suite. the bar serves a good menu up until 11 pm after which there are just sandwiches and for some strange reason chicken tikka masalla and rice. food and beer is a little pricey (beer 3.90 a pint and a portion of chips 3.50) but no worse than any other reasonable London hotel."
26,1264,"Jul 7 2009 	Couldn't Ask for More	My husband and I stayed at the Rembrandt for 6 nights from June 29 to July 5 and we were totally pleased. The staff at reception were very friendly and most helpful. Our room was always spotless. Just know that to make the lights work in the room that you have to put your room card into a small slot right by the door. Then all the switches work. That was new to us. Breakfast each morning was included and almost everything you would want to eat in the morning was there. We ate enough to keep us going to a late lunch. The staff were right there to offer tea or coffee as soon as you sat down and cleared away used plates when you got up to help yourself a secondtime. They have excellent croissants and pastries. The location is great - right across the street from the V &amp; A, and about a 5 minute walk to the South Kensington tube station. Buses 74, 14, and two others stop right nearby. #74 takes you to Oxford Street and #14 takes you to Piccadilly Circus. The prices on their own website are probably the best you will find. They supply soap, shampoo and shower gel. You cannot go wrong by staying at this hotel and we will be back next time we are in London."
27,1264,"Jul 5 2009 	Very Nice Place to Stay	Trip to Wimbledon tennis matches London was full of tennis fans, hotels quite full. This was a Very great Hotel . Front Desk personnel very professional and helpful. Great location for Tube stations, Restaurants, Shopping. The included English breakfast was great best we ever had in Europe or in the USA . The room was large compaired to some 4 star hotels in Europe. Very clean. Everything in the room worked. Bar and Lounge were great. Would go here again without a second thought. Try it.you wont be disappointed."
28,1264,"Jun 20 2009 	Excellent Hotel!	Stayed at the Rembrandt with my wife from 6 - 9 june 09, and i must say i was pleasantly surprised as we booked a standard double but were upgraded on arrival to a superior double room. We found the hotel to be very nice and clean with exceptionally helpful staff especially Tina at reception and celio at concierge. Its in a Perfect Location, offers excellent Service and its a very clean Hotel!"
29,1264,"Jun 18 2009 	No bells and whistles but worth coming back to ...	Nice service from the get-go. Not British based staff, but very welcoming and well spoken. Judging from their accents you would be able to communicate in multiple languages. Hotel should advertise that. They were very responsive, and even printed some reservations for me, free of charge.If you arrive early, they will look after your luggage, while you go explore around Kensington. Room was TINY for what I am used to, but comfortably fit 2 adults and we didn't have to fight for space. Room had all basic amenities, plus &quot;trouser press&quot; :-) Nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing missing. Free internet was great. Mind that Wi-Fi is only available in the lobby, and in your room you have RJ-45 network cable provided in the desk area. US T-Mobile users, your uma service WILL NOT work on your Wi-Fi enabled devices!Location was great, just minutes from South Kensington tube station, and great shopping area. If you turn right from the hotel, you can find ATM within 100 feet and nice stores until Knightsbridge tube station. Chef Ramsey's Boxwood Cafe is only 2 minute walk from Knightsbrige station - delicious food, great ambiance and terrific dining experience for $150 for 2 people 3 course meal. There is nice, French brasserie &quot;Paul&quot; across the street from S. Kensington Tube Station - I recommend it!McD's is only 3 blocks to the right from the hotel. Cab to soho will run you ~ 9L and to Victoria Coach station ~ 5.5L Get Oyster card in the tube, and don't forget to return it before you leave, to get your deposit back. You will save loads of money on transportation. I liked the hotel, and the staff. Nice price for a nice hotel in London. AC tends to make room a little wet, but 5 minutes of open window fixes the issue. if you get the street room, opening the window will give you a headache. Shower head was broken when we got there. I used theproblem envelope from the desk, and gave it to the staff. When came back from my meal, everything was fixed. I recommend this hotel for you London stay."
30,1264,"Jun 18 2009 	Fourth Stay - Each One Gets Better	This was a two-part stay. Part 1Spent three days here before heading off for a couple of days in Paris via Eurostar. Room booked through a great deal from British Airways. Room was small, clean and you gotta love the free internet connection and air conditioning. They held our bags for us until our return three days later.The return room was booked through Hotel and NOT BA. Upon return we were happy to get a free upgrade to a Grand Room. (Photos attached). Lots of space, also very clean. Not much to add to what everybody else including myself has posted. The staff is excellent. One of the concierge's (sp) has been there 17 years. I think that says something about the way the hotel is run. In fact we saw quite a few people that we have recognized over the past 5 years or so. Hotel is close to V&amp;A (Yaaa we finally went..it was starting to be a bad joke.) Also went to the science museum to see Wallace and Grommit. There is a ton of cool stuff in there; and it is a short walk from the hotel. And you dont have to be a kid to enjoy.Breakfast had large variety and large crowds at times. You could eat healthy or go for the full English. I do not know what they put in the scrambled eggs but both the wife and I have spent hours speculating. I need that recipe. Plenty of places to eat n the area. We went to the pub (Bunch of Grapes) right down the road. Go upstairs for a better selection. We ate at two places twice. Both near the south Ken Tube station. First was Pirienos Italian. Service is indifferent however haven never been disappointed in a meal here. The second and more interesting is the Polish Resto called Daquise. Atmosphere is fascinating. I lioked the food. Home style comfort food. Nothing fancy. MY wife was worried she would get &quot;yelled at&quot; for not eating her vegetables. I loved this food. Let's summarize: Good clean rooms. Free internet (hardwired) in every room. Great staff. The Concierge printed last minue event tickets for us as well as boarding passes...Don't forget to &quot;thank them&quot;. I maybe could find a cheaper place or a newer place, or a more upscale place,,,but I like it here and here I shall return. Oh and yes I have recommended to friends and foe alike.Thanks,Jeff"
31,1264,"Jun 10 2009 	Excellent Service 	Stayed at the Rembrandt with a friend to celebrate her birthday and had a very enjoyable experience from the time we checked in, which was swift and efficient (also parked our car - which was a major plus and its discounted) the rooms were imaculate, not huge but very good for London and had a whirlpool bath which was fab, flat screen tv and robes - not a great view but you dont spend your time looking out of the window. The lounge bar was very good for a snack and a drink mid afternoon and service there was excellent - breakfast was very good and even though very busy when we went down the service was exceptional and a great buffet with everything you could want for a great breakfast - could not fault the Rembrandt and will definitely return when next in London...Very close to Harrods and lots of shops and bars - also the Spa which adjoins the hotel looks very good and had a tour - well worth the money and you get a discount on treatments.Look forward to going back.."
32,1264,"Jun 9 2009 	Pretty much as stated here	Walls are somewhat thin, a bit of street noise that drowns out nicely with the a/c. Big LCD TV, but gave me problems. Clean, comfortable, well appointed. Free internet is very nice."
33,1264,"May 28 2009 	Excellent Location - Excellent Value for Money	After ringing round a number of hotels in London, we were struggling to find a reasonable hotel with a pool, a good location, and room for two adults and our five year old daughter, at a reasonable price. The Rembrant was showing a price on the tinterweb of 250 for a double room including breakfast for two nights, which was pretty reasonable for a 4 start hotel in such a good location. When we rang them to ask if they had a room for the three of us they offered a family room at the same price, which I thought was fantastic value.Room was easily big enough for the three of us, very clean, facilities excellent. Although we didn't eat in the hotel in the evening, we did have breakfast which was very nice. The bar prices were not at all expensive for London. My only gripe is that the staff were generally not that warm, although they were efficient. Maybe I am being picky here, but in a 4 star hotel bar when I am in a group I expect the waiter to come and take a drinks order, whereas everytime we had to go to the bar and then wait 10 to 20 minutes for our drinks, but heh it kept me sober. A nice smile and a hello is free and goes a long way!All in all would really recommend this place and we will definately use it for our family weekends in London again."
34,1264,May 14 2009 	Good Value and more	In my never ending quest for value for money hotels in London I believe I have found a Gem.On my way from Brussels to London by train I found an offer for the Rembrandt at 95 pounds which I tried to book. Before it happened my Laptop ran out of battery so on arrival at the station I called them and spoke to reservations who surprisingly offered the same room rate. On arrival at the hotel I found out that for 20 pounds extra I could get a superior room which I opted to do. Front desk staff are friendly in that mechanical have a nice day fashion. Location is fantastic and the Lobby is good looking and well laid out.Room was great spacious with large warmly decorated bathroom with a pretty good Jacuzzi. Lots of towels soaps shampoo's. Furnishings looked good no worn corners on wall paper linen on bed was great and nice pillows. My room was at the back of the hotel so quiet and I had 2 windows that fully opened which I loved. Room for London standards was large. In addition all usual extras i.e. iron minibar internet connection. Could not really have asked for more.Breakfast buffet which was included was very nice and staff friendly and efficient even though the place was packed with 15 people waiting to get in. Could not fault it.The Bar located just before the restaurant looks very good and for someone who spends as many days a year in hotels as I do feels right.Now heres the downside. Room service (cleaning) during my 3 days never made up my room until very late afternoon except one morning when they came in without knocking at 08:00. Chap who refreshes the minibar came in twice at 15:00 in the afternoon without knocking. He claims due to the please make up my room sign on the door.Staff in the bar are friendly in as much as they feel they have to. This is reflected at reception too. Tried to get a coffee at 09:45 in the bar and was told in no uncertain terms we are closed even though staff where standing around. I was advised to go to the restaurant where breakfast was still being served. As I was having a meeting didn't feel that was the right place.Bottom line very nice place good value for money and with a little staff encouragement -v- customer satisfaction could be a great place.This Hotel in it's amazing location with fresh decor would I believe be in the top 10 if staff would go that extra 10 percent and take the mechanics out of trying to be nice. Saying that there where some exceptions. Both concierges I dealt with where 5 star.
35,1264,"May 13 2009 	Excellent stay location and service	We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The location is excellent as it is down the street from Harrods, accross the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum and really close to the South Kensington subway station. We were in a large executive room with a lovely view from our window. The room had self coffee and tea service and an iron and pants press. Excellent and generous English breakfast buffet in the mornings. The roast beef sandwiches available in the lounge were wonderful as well. The concierge was very helpful in providing directions, information and booking us transportation to the airport. I highly recommend this hotel."
36,1264,"May 7 2009 	We would stay here again and recommend it to others without hesitation.	I chose this hotel specifically for its closeness to the V&amp;A, Natural History and Science museums, to the tube/Picadilly Line and good reviews on Trip Advisor, but of of all the hotels I've stayed in, I found this to be one of the most efficient. All staff were friendly and helpful, and were quick to respond to any queries we had. The only drawbacks were that the bed was a double rather than a king which meant that my partner's feet were hanging off the end of the bed (he being 6 foot 4!). They were willing to move us for a charge, but it was a small issue. The view from the room was also nothing to write home about (a roof), but I guess that's the luck of the draw! A few touches we noticed - free internet access in the foyer, prompt servicing of rooms in the morning, proper hairdryers, magazines in the room, fresh flowers by the lifts, robes, big mugs for coffee at breakfast and real scambled eggs!The hotel in general was very well maintained - we didn't spot anything which looked tired or 'out of order'. The ambiance was relaxed and positive. We didn't hear anyone complaining at reception which is a rare event in some of the hotels I've stayed in! A good indicator we thought.Good value for money given the high standards the hotel clearly has. We would stay here again and recommend it to others without hesitation."
37,1264,Apr 30 2009 	Pleasant hotel needs to upgrade rooms	Excellent location and typical London hotel. Good reception and bar. Room was spacious and comfortable but could do with some paint and brighter colours. Free Internet in room. The bathroom was small and could do with a new tub/shower. Breakfast was a good and traditional buffet in their rather small restaurant. The atmosphere throughout is good and I would gladly stay at his hotel again.
38,1264,"Apr 27 2009 	Very good choice-would definitely return to this hotel.	Recently stayed at The Rembrandt with my wife for 3 nights.Reception staff were very friendly and hospitable. We were given an upgrade when we booked in without any request by us.Room was very comfortable and clean.Plenty of room for a london hotel.Great location right in heart of london and right near South Kensington Tube station.Bus stop right outside front door was also a big help.Breakfast was excellent and typically British with all the trimmings and as much as you liked.All good quality and fresh.The hotel lounge is a great spot for afternoon tea or a drink after a day sightseeing. Very comfortable and inexpensive. Also try the small Italian restaurant, Orsini, just 100 metres down from the hotel.Turn right as you exit the hotel.Terrific quality and value italian food. Salvatore, the owner, will probably give you some of his home made limoncella with dessert."
39,1264,"Apr 23 2009 	Great hotel! *****	I loved this hotel - it was clean,spacious and the location was amazing.It's located near the underground,and its only about a 10 minute walk to Harrods.The V&amp;A and natural history museum is literally right across the road.We had a small room as only 2 of us were staying but it was lovely - big TV, clean bathroom and extremely comfortable beds! I didnt really want to come home to be honest!We never had dinner or lunch in the hotels restaurant but breakfast was very good. Staff were helpful and pleasant. The bar and lounge was stylish and comfortable with an overall nice enviroment.I couldnt fault anything at the Rembrandt and i would definitely stay there again."
40,1264,"Apr 23 2009 	The Rembrandt - THANKS BRIT AIR!!!!	We stayed here for two free days on the Brit Air promotion, and must say we were very happy. The room was HUGE, and SPOTLESS. The bathroom (sink/toilet/shower) all worked very well. Elevators in good working condition. As others mention, you can't beat the tube stop - it is really close by and is the direct line to the airport. Breakfast had a huge spread (we are vegetarians), and very delicious. The lobby is beautiful, but more importantly we were HAPPY with our room. The bed and the pillows were very comfortable as well. I've already recommended it to friends. Nice view outside, but no problem with noise. We usually stay in budget hotels, so it was a real treat."
41,1264,"Apr 22 2009 	A real surprise	I booked a trip to London in January with BA - which included one night free in a London hotel. I chose the Rembrandt - and a very good choice at that. My room was not ready when I arrived so they let me use the facilities at the adjoining fitness center, where I was able to shower and change. My room was clean -- 2 twin beds -- and not too small. Easy access to the the South Ken underground - and across the street from the V&amp;A. A good choice for the free breakfast as well. The room was clean with amenties ... a working, strong shower, for example. I stayed only one night as I moved to my usual hotel. However, I would consider this a good choice as a backup hotel. It was a good and pleasant surprise for an overnight stay."
42,1264,"Apr 21 2009 	A nice hotel well located.	We found this a good hotel, at least the lobby, dining room and the rooms. The hallways were a disaster, dirty, stained carpet, marred doors. It was a relief to get into the nice room. The staff was great, food good, and this place is incredibly well located, right across from the V&amp;A Museum and about 3 blocks from a tube station. We got a deal through British Airways, otherwise, I think the prices are high. It's considered 4 star but that's a European 4 star, not a North American rating. I'd place this as a good 3 star by NA standards."
43,1264,"Apr 20 2009 	Nice hotel in lovely area	I stayed here with my mother for four days and thoroughly enjoyed it. We paid extra for early check-in after an overnight flight, which was worth it. We had a single executive room, which was perfect. The room had a loveseat, desk with chair, and a chair with end table. The bathroom was spacious with plenty of water pressure and hot water. The buffet breakfast, which was included with our room, was filling and had a large variety from cereal to eggs to fruit. The hotel bar is nice, but the service could be slow. Overall though, the staff was very friendly and we would go back again.Also close to the South Kensington tube stop, which is a direct line from the airport."
44,1264,"Mar 25 2009 	BA Special Deal trip	We just returned from a special offer trip from British Airlines, including two nights at The Rembrandt, in Knightsbridge (closer to South Kensington). We had other options (staying with friends) for our other nights, but planned our last 2 nights here - partly for easy access to Heathrow the final morning as well as a good sightseeing location. We had seen some &quot;not so good&quot; reviews for the hotel, but we felt that this hotel was quite nice - the deal included a continental breakfast, which was actually a full breakfast buffet with hot &quot;English Breakfast&quot; items included. I'd definitely stay here again with a good deal came up."
45,1264,"Mar 23 2009 	A pleasant FREE surprise	We took advantage of the British Airways cheap airfare plus 2 free nights of hotel and chose the Rembrandt after researching all of the options. We read some negative trip advisor ratings, but we really liked the location, so we went for it. At 9:30 a.m. upon check-in, they had a room ready for us - total surprise! Not only was it clean, but it was spacious and modern - also a surprise! The bathroom was large for Euro hotels. It is literally across the street from the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, and a 8-10 min. walk to Harrod's. The South Kensington tube stop is 5 min. away. The staff was super nice. The breakfast buffet was lovely - beautiful room, lots of offerings, fresh. The bar was also nice for a nightcap. Great neighborhood - cheese shop (Cave au Fromage), Indian restaurant, etc."
46,1264,"Mar 19 2009 	We'd stay here again	We stayed here for 3 nights. Were lucky to have a large end-of-corridor room at rear of hotel which was quiet, clean and comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly. Particularly appreciated the comfortable lounge bar, but not the spirits prices they charged - way over the top, even for London. Excellent position near the museums, tube and good choice of local restaurants in the nearby streets."
47,1264,"Mar 5 2009 	4 Star Hotel - I think not.	We stayed at The Rembrandt as an incentive with flying with British Airways. The bonus of this hotel is that its close to the Natural History Museum, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Science Museum, Harrods. The local pub is Hoop &amp; Toy and shi shi frou frou member's only nightclub Boujis. Apparently the stars and the royals go there. The rejects go to Hoop &amp; Toy. lolThe hotel lobby and dining area is renovated and modern though does not reflect the rest of the hotel. The rooms were quite the disappointment.The corridors were dim and dated and the wallpaper was coming off in some areas.Our hotel room would have been spectacular if we were still living in the 70's. Not sure how to explain - it had everything that a hotel should have including the high end amenities, however we could not get over the outdated decor. You could feel the spring in the bed and you could hear your neighbours flushing the toilet or walking above your head. The room had a safe as well as a trouser press! Overall our hotel experience was bizarre. I would expect more from this hotel as it is located in South Kensington...."
48,1264,"Feb 25 2009 	large clean room but slightly overpriced.	we stayed in the grand room (supposed to be the best room in the hotel) which had a really huge, comfortable bed, the bathroom was okay but wasnt impressed with the 'jacuzzi' bath and rusty shower head?!?! The view from our room was dark, bleak and depressing! expected a little more for our money. The room service was good but the food took a rather long time to be delivered and didnt meet expectations. The food and the drinks in the minibar were highly overpriced.overall the room was lovely but we wouldnt pay to there again"
49,1264,"Feb 24 2009 	Fantastic location	We stayed 2 nights here free as part of a British Airways deal. It's right across from the Victoria and Albert Museum and a short walk to wonderful restaurants in South Kensington (Bibendum, Racine, Kwality India). The staff was very friendly, there was free internet access, a terrific breakfast and a health club adjoining (available for a slight fee.) Our room wasn't huge or fancy but had a powerful shower and was quite clean if somewhat dowdy and worn. (The mattresses were firm, though) We then paid for some additional nights because our daughter is living nearby and the location was so convenient. Again, we booked through British Airways and got a wonderful promotional deal - I think it amounted to about $145 a night! In London!! This isn't a &quot;romantic&quot; getaway but if you don't plan on being in the room much and just want a nice place to stay with lovely staff, I would highly recommend The Rembrandt."
50,1264,"Jan 7 2009 	Never again!	Myself and my son stayed over the christmas, it was only a two night break. I find the staff overall quite rude, Maids knocked at your room and shouting through the door to come in and clean on boxing day morning at 9am, they also refused to let me use the toilet the day before as they were cleaning when I entered my room. A booked wake up call was not given so I missed the serpentine swim at hyde park . The kettle in the room was filthy and full of limescale. They promised a gift (which was also advertised in their brouchure) for children, my son did not get one!! Overall quite sharp toned, perhaps because I was a women travelling alone with my son? Food on christmas day average nothing exceptional, all in all a complete waste of 450 and a ruined christmas, Bad show rembrandt, only good thing about the hotel, is the location."
51,1264,"Jan 2 2009	Great Location	I have stayed at this hotel 3 times. The location is good, central but not noisy. It is very close to South Kensington tube station, probably less than 5 minutes walk, there is also a bus stop opposite. It is within walking distance of the Knightsbridge shops, and to the galleries/museums in the area and it is opposite the V&amp;A. The rooms are comfortable and spacious, I was once given a small room but was moved after I told reception it was far too small for the price I had paid. It was handled quickly and efficiently. The breakfast is a choice of continental or cooked, with a wide selection. I have not dined in the evening although did have a light lunch upon arrival once which was very nice. The bar area, and restaurant, foyer etc, are well furnished."
52,1264,"Dec 17 2008 	Great Hotel Great Location	I stayed at this hotel from 11/29-12/13/2008. This is the third time I have stayed here. I discovered the hotel 2 years ago loved it and have come back. The staff is great from the front desk to Housekeeping and the restaurant staff. Polite and helpful at every turn. The room was a good size and had everything you could possibly need. The TV even had American Football on Sunday night. The breakfast is standard hotel buffet fare, but, plentifull and anything you could possibly want. The location is great. Five minute walk to South Kensington Tube station and lots of buses stop across the street. Pleasant walk to Kensington Palace and of course just 10 minutes to Harrods. All in all, a very nice hotel that I will be visiting again. (Economy permitting)"
53,1264,"Dec 5 2008 	Good location great breakfast average room very expensive stay	The hotel is located near the south kensington tube station and very close to the museum area. The access is easy by tube and bus (bus no 14). The room was small, the heating system made some weird noises during our stay. Breakfast is rich and covers a wide variety of dishes. You have to pay 7 pounds in order to use the swimming pool. All in all, an average london hotel, easy accessible but very expensive."
54,1264,"Nov 24 2008 	Comfortable but not luxurious	I stayed at the Rembrandt from the 7th through the 17th of November, 2008, in a superior queen room. Rooms at the Rembrandt are not large, but are newly refurbished, and have a fair amount of storage space, and the usual amenities (iron, ironing board, safe, minibar). The bathroom was small, but quite functional, with good water pressure for the shower (and a rubber anti-skid mat for the tub bottom - a necessary amenity, as the tub surface itself was rather slick, and is elevated several inches above the level of the bathroom floor, as is common in European hotels). The climate control worked well - I was able to cool the room, even though it was November (but quite mild). Conversely, the heating unit worked well when needed. The buffet breakfast downstairs was standard hotel fare (steam table with eggs/sausages/potatoes, etc. and stations for cold cereal, toast, pastries, juice, and some fruit). Service was variable, depending on the number of guests being served. At peak times, there were short waits for available space. I had few dealings with the front desk, after check-in, but those dealings were fine."
55,1264,Nov 12 2008 	Good Location	This hotel is across the street from the museum and close to Kensington Palace and Harrods. I only stayed one night so I did not get to go to the museum or see the whole neighborhood but how can you go wrong in Knightsbridge/South Kensington. The room was okay but I agree with the other reviewers that the breakfast is not that good. I enjoyed the Kensington Palace Tour and the gardens are beautiful.
56,1264,"Nov 8 2008 	Hotel great food awful!	My daughter and I stayed at the Rembrandt for a 4 day break a couple of weeks ago. The hotel was very nice, pleasant surroundings, friendly staff, clean rooms but the food was pretty awful! We only had one evening meal. There was very little choice of all of the courses and the staff had no idea what the choice of two sweets were! The meal cost us over 100 including one drink each. Fortunately there was a nice pub near by that we ate at the other three nights. The breakfasts had an average choice BUT they were not hot! The cooked breakfast was actually quite cold hence I had just toast and marmalade for two days. Summing up, I would not stay at the Rembrandt again."
57,1264,"Oct 2 2008 	Peace and tranquility in Kensington	I spent six nights in an Executive Room (a step above &quot;Superior&quot;) during September. Initial contact with the hotel was plagued with self-inflicted problems - mainly because I was in a different timezone and work demands meant the dates of my stay kept changing - but staff handled my contacts so well that I felt in safe hands before I had even arrived in the country. My first impressions of the competence and friendliness of staff only improved through-out the visit. I had asked for a quiet room and found myself in a back room without much of a view. It was exceptionally quiet though. The only noise annoyance came from the air-conditioning - which I eventually turned off at night despite the warm weather.The room was not spacious, but I never felt cramped despite the length of my stay. It was also clean, modern and the facilities all worked like they are supposed to.I had breakfast at the hotel each morning and found it to be fine - although the coffee was truly dire (like it is in most of London). Stick to the tea! I also had dinner twice. Dinner was a help-yourself cavery and certainly wasn't bad, in fact it was much better than most of the over-priced restaurants nearby, but it wasn't outstanding. One place I really can recommend is the creperie near the South Kensington tube station - the food there was excellent and pretty cheap given the location.The only real problem I experienced on my whole visit was with my laundry. As far as I could discover, there was only one laundrette within walking distance - and that was never open. I ended up having to use the hotel laundry which was stingingly expensive.Overall my experience at the Rembrandt was really positive. The facilities are excellent, the location is brilliant and the staff were genuine and helpful. I will definitely stay there again."
58,1264,"Sep 13 2008	Great Location very clean and excellent service	Stayed at the Rembrandt for five nights last week. Overall, the stay was excellent.We were on the sixth floor, generous sized room and fantastic bath.Room very clean and the housekeeping service fantastic.Our rate included a continental breakfast which was fine, I'm not a big breakfast eater but I did notice that some packages included a full english breakfast if that's of interest to anyone.Very close to the tube, buses and taxis were parked directly in front of the hotel.Will definitely stay there again in the future."
59,1264,"Aug 20 2008	Eat Breakfast somewhere else	it had been a few years since I stayed at the Rembrandt Hotel. The location is convenient, but you pay the price for the location. The room came with breakfast. I use to look forward to their food, but the breakfast has gone very downhill. Watery scrambled eggs, canned fruit, fatty bacon and little else worth eating except for the cereal. For such an expensive hotel, they sure have let their food go to the dogs."
60,1264,"Aug 3 2008	Locaton great everything else needs work	Good - Location of hotel is brilliant, close to south kensington station and Harrods. Bad - Rooms are old and in need of refurbishment but then again we got what we paid for, prices are cheap for london and we were out all day sightseeing so it suited us. Breakfast is nice. Overall, don't expect much from the hotel but then again locaton makes up for it"
61,1264,"Jul 30 2008 	A comfortable reasonable well-located hotel	The Rembrandt is reasonably-priced, quiet and centrally located. The breakfast which is included in the room price is good with a large choice. I didn't try the restaurant for other meals. The hotel is furnished in a very conservative style, not very contemporary or very luxurious, but very comfortable. My bedroom was air-conditioned with double-glazed windows so that I didn't hear the heavy traffic on the street outside. My only criticism is that when i checked in, they took a 50 deposit charge on my credit card to cover any possible expenses. This deposit was cancelled when I left, but even so I found it very unpleasant to be treated as a potential thief. Except for this, i recommend this hotel very highly to people who want an agreeable stay in London."
62,1264,"Jul 28 2008 	Poor for a 4 Star Hotel	This hotel should not be listed as a 4 Star ! I was booked into a Superior room which is rated as a &quot;posher room&quot;.The bed linen was dirty and smelt of body odour, even the curtains smelt stale ! The carpets where thread bare, the bathrooms old, rusty the overall room was like a 1 star travel lodge ! I would have been happy to pay 45 per night to stay at this hotel but paying 191-00 to stay in a tarted up DUMP is a joke ! The wallpaper, doors and just the general look of the hotel is tired and unkept ! The leasure club attached to the hotel was in a very poor state, the jacuzzi didnt work, the pool was slimey, there as plasters floating in the pool and to top it all off there was chewing gum on the steps.DONT STAY THERE IF YOUR AFTER A DECENT NIGHTS SLEEP IN A LUXURY ROOM - IT WONT HAPPEN"
63,1264,"Jul 17 2008 	GOOD LOCATION BUT TINY ROOMS	My husband and I stayed 1 night at this hotel on business. On first impressions the reception and lobby area was small and not as plush as some other hotels. We were allocated a room on the 5th floor. The corridor carpet was shabby in places and the wall scuffed. The room and bathroom were tiny.. The small queen size bed was in an alcove so to get out of bed you virtually had to climb over the bed. The room was noisy. The decor and furniture were ok and the breakfast was fine. The location was very good and we had no issues with staff. Overall I think the hotel was ok, but it was the smallest bedroom I have encounted in London and the hotel did not feel like a luxury hotel."
64,1264,"Jul 17 2008 	Pleasant Stay at the Rembrandt	Spent 5 nights in early July. I found the staff to be very helpful and pleasant (if somewhat difficult to understand with heavy accents for most personnel). Our group was made up of 1 couple and a grandmother/grandaughter - so we had the opportunity to see both a twin bedded room and a gueen size room. The twin room was beautiful, on the second floor facing the V&amp;A museum. It had the most delightful little balcony. It had been updated fairly recently, I would say, with a very nice bathroom. The queen room was towards the back of the hotel, nowhere near as nice and cost more - substantially more! However, the room towards the rear was very quiet while the room facing the museum had a lot of street noise.Breakfast buffet was quite good with a nice selection and the best scrambled eggs we encountered on a 14 day trip that included Paris and parts of Scotland. Our breakfasts were included in our room rates, but we did eat there for dinner one night as well. They offer a 25% discount for early dinners, so we gave them a try. Dinner is also a buffet and while acceptable, was not anything great. Rather limited choices. Beware if you are paying by credit card and are from the States....they will attempt to do the conversion for you, running the charge in dollars and not pounds, and won't bother to ask you first. I had repeatedly read that if asked, you should always have the charges run in pounds as it will be a higher conversion fee, if run in dollars, than your own credit card company would charge you. There are 2 computers in the lobby for internet. At check in, I was told that you could purchase a password to allow you to access the internet. However, if you just sat down to use the computers, you could get right online without any password. Not sure what was going on, but was able to check weather and email with no problem and at no cost! As other posters have pointed out, the location is superb. I would certainly consider staying here on future trips to London"
65,1264,"Jul 15 2008 	Very good all things considered	OK. So twice a year my wife and I treat ourselves to an overnighter in London without the kids and this was one of thise nights.Great room at a great rate, the only problem was no air-con, so waking up sweating in teh night after several drinks may be the norm, but in 25 degrees, yuck.The restaurant doesn't really do much if you're on a special occasion, we made the right choice to eat out and just take breakfast. That said, we had a beautiful cheeseburger in the bar on arrival. One of the best ever...I'd recommend this place to anyone wanting a bit more space for under 200.00. The Westbury in Mayfair and Le Meridien in Piccadily were our last two venues, but The Rembrandt wins it. DOes anyone know if there's cheaper parking nearby as the car park behind the hotel was 30 for 24 hours..."
66,1264,"Jul 15 2008 	Fab location for this hotel	I stayed at this hotel for 1 night (saturday) in July. Check in staff were really helpful. We arrived early and had a lunch appointment to go to. We really wanted to check into our room before lunch but thought it wouldn't be possible. They called housekeeping and asked for the room to be finished ASAP so we could refresh ourselves and head off to lunch. We'd booked a Superior room also which was very spacious and had a sofa so you don't have to sit around on the beds. Location is great. Right opposite the Victoria and Albert museum. Great for exploring the west end. Also close enough on picadilly/district lines if you want to park outside of london and come in by Tube. You would think that the rooms would be noisy too - because of being in such a busy area, but we didn't hear a sound all night. Must have great triple-glazing!!Breakfast was very nice, lots of choice...and they even had soya milk for me, which can be difficult to find in hotels!"
67,1264,"Jul 8 2008 	So Much Potential	I'll start with what was good about this hotel. The location is terrific. The South Kensington tube station is a block and a half away, Harrods, etc. are about 3-4 blocks the other direction. The V&amp;A museum is literally across the street, so it was nice to walk over for the day. Knightsbridge / Kensington are two of the nicest areas in the Center of London. The music academy is a block away, so there are always great performances to attend without having to travel very far. It's a great neighborhood.From the moment we checked into the Rembrandt, it seemed as though the desk staff had something more important to do (and we had just spent the previous 3 weeks in Italy, so our tolerance for 'abrupt' treatment from hotel staff was pretty high). Aside from one nice man who loaned us an extension cord and some of his tools to fix a suitcase, the staff was just plain rude.Our room had once been beautiful. It was large and had a nice sitting area that overlooked the V&amp;A Museum. The condition of the room, however was a far cry from 'shabby chic'. The carpet was worn and stained, the furniture was worn nearly through in many places, and both the furniture and the feather mattress pad and duvet had a musty smell. There was so much deferred maintenance that I can't list it all, but the main thing that stands out in my mind is that the mini-bar fridge hadn't been cleaned in a long time, and with the key-card system the hotel uses to shut down electricity in the room having turned off the power, smelled slightly of wet cat. The bathroom sink drain was slow, the ironing board wouldn't stand up. You get the idea. Once a hotel experience turns, as this one did, the list of things one notices gets longer and longer :)After the first breakfast, we vowed to walk to other food. The buffet reflected the same lack of care as the rest of the presentation. We just kept asking ourselves, &quot;does anybody care that things are like this?&quot;. The answer is that if someone did, they wouldn't be. When we went to the front desk to express a few concerns, the young lady (without realizing that I could see what she was writing) while listening to my partner describe our concern, smiled and wrote down a completely different number (while repeating it back). When I repeated the number, she realized I was standing where I could see her notepad, blushed, scribbled it out and wrote the number down. It spoke to the lack of concern for us or any customer, and we weren't going on like I am right now, it was something as simple as a request for a room key because housekeeping had taken ours out of the key-card slot.This hotel could be a great find, with just a little TLC and a tightening of the managerial reigns. Location is one thing, but an absence of pride is another. While it wasn't the worst hotel room we have seen, we will definitely seek other accommodations in the future."
68,1264,Jul 1 2008 	Location location location	Location wise the hotel is situated around 10 minutes walking distance from the famous harrods shopping centre and knightsbridge. the single room was pretty compact and small but clean. nice and affordable hotel for short term business stays. friendly front desk staff. do not expect a five star ammenities though.
69,1264,"Jun 29 2008 	Bed with a duvet!	Stayed at this hotel four nights in the end of June. Having read good reviews at this page, I was looking very much forward to my stay. And I was nor disappointed.Check-in was friendly and efficient. Luggage brought up to my room, which was at a quiet street at the back of the hotel.Queen bed with a light duvet! What a treat for one that cannot stand those sheets and blankets that tend to end up in a mix in the morning. The best bed ever in a London hotel!The size of the room plenty for me, and room and bath had all I needed. The door to the corridor could, however, been more soundproof. You could hear every single person walking by, so one of the nights I woke up by someone passing by talking. Normal talking, but it was almost as they were in the room!The breakfast was very good, with a good selection of warm and cold food. I always turned up at 7, and there was always plenty of tables available until I had finished at 8. I did not feel that I had to leave the table for others. One had to get through The Daily Telegraph provided, and enjoy the meal. (Good choice of newspaper!)The concierges were very helpful, and always recogniced you. The location is very convinient for the tube. 5 min. walk from South Kensington Station, and about 10 from Kensington.I had a very nice stay, felt very welcome, and would definitely stay again."
70,1264,"Jun 18 2008 	A pleasant experience	I stayed at the Rembrandt for 2 very pleasant nights.The room was nicely furnished, comfortable bed &amp; had a nice bathroom. I was at the rear of the hotel so it was very quiet. The location was convenient, a short walk from the tube station, bus stop right outside &amp; tour bus stop just done the street.The staff were friendly and arranged everything requested without any problems."
71,1264,"Jun 13 2008	Tried to stay at Rembrandt but ........	I booked a stay at the Rembrandt for one night (12 June) through the British Airways website, at the same time as booking my flight. There was a good room rate, comparatively speaking (130 B&amp;B), and the reviews of the hotel seemed good. This was a brief business trip to London.Anyway when I arrived at the hotel around 2.30 pm, the hotel manager told me that they had had problems, apparently of their own making, which had meant the hotel was heavily overbooked and that they didn't have a room for me. He had booked me in a hotel close by (&quot;also a 4 star&quot;, he stated) and they would pay for a taxi to take me straight there. Given that I had a meeting to attend at 4 pm I didn't make a fuss and accepted mistakes can happen. So I was then despatched to the Regency Hotel close by. It is pretty tired it has to be said, not a four star but rather a three star, and while the basics of my stay were delivered i.e. I managed to get a decent night's sleep in a comfy bed, it was not a four star experience.So while the hotel manager at the Rembrandt was very apologetic and assured me I'd get an upgrade if I returned , I don't think I'll be going back. If I was to go again, I would certainly make a point of calling a day or two before arriving to receive an assurance there was no problem. The thing which irritated me was the misrepresentation, which I accept may have been innocent, that the hotel I was being offered in substitution was equivalent class or standard . So this may have been a complete one-off for them, never to be repeated, but be careful........"
72,1264,"Jun 4 2008 	Excellent Service	I have stayed at this hotel for years and usually stay there 4 times a year. My last trip was last month and I will be returning in September. The staff are cordial and helpful and very welcoming. I am always given the same room and everything is in perfect order. I have stayed in both the remodelled rooms and the more traditional. They seem to remember from one trip to another how you like your coffee at breakfast, which I find amazing. The breakfast is excellent and the concierge staff and front desk staff, maintenance and cleaning staff are very helpful. The area is so convenient and safe and so easy to get around on the bus outside the door and the various restaurants around the South Kensington Tube station are very good. It is a very comfortable hotel for woman travelling on their own. I would definately refer this hotel to anything wishing to visti London. Everyone is so helpful. I look foward to my next visit in September/08."
73,1264,"May 25 2008 	Great City Break	We selected the Rembrandt primarily on location. We wanted to be able to reach the main areas easily and was a good choiceThe reception and public areas were clean and brightly appointed, the room we had was on the 1st floor and was very pleasant, all the features you would expectOur friends were on a higher floor and their room was much smaller, but adequate.I was also impressed with the cleanlinessWe took in a show and dined out on each evening.Breakfast was a bit of a &quot;Cattle Market&quot; to begin with, but the food quality was ok.Some of the staff were a bit indifferent, but overall the service was goodA good visit and will be back"
74,1264,"May 23 2008 	Wonderful Hotel	We booked our first three night stay in an executive twin room through the on-line hotel website as they did have the best prices. We were allocated Room 375 one of the refurbished rooms on a quiet back street. Check in was quick enough and the reception staff were polite and efficient. A swipe of our credit card was taken to cover any minibar items that we would use but there was no amount charged as such and we paid by travelers cheques when we checked out.On our second day of stay we decided to book another three night stay which we booked through reception  we would be coming back in 10 days time and we were able to leave a suitcase with them free of charge until we returned.When we arrived back for our second three night stay we were told that our credit card would be charged 50GBP for each night of our stay as well as the price of our three night stay - 540GBP, a total of 690GBP (even though I was going to be paying with travelers cheques), oh the receptionist said, well your credit card will be reimbursed with the whole amount when you pay with travelers cheques on check-out. Needless to say I paid there and then up-front with travelers cheques for the whole stay. I was told that it was hotel policy to charge this way because I had NOT booked through the internet !!!!!! Anyway our room was wonderful, quite large and we had a lovely outlook to a back street with terrace houses. There were two large full length windows which opened onto a tiny balcony as well as another double window, these windows had wonderful blackout curtains. Our room had two very comfortable beds, a small sitting area, a desk area and plasma/lcd tv, a safe, hairdryer and airconditioning. We had 25 degree celcius and 27 degree celcius days so the airconditioner was used and was very efficient. The bathroom was very modern with a shower over the spa bath. The only complaints I would have are the very thin walls and extremely creaky floor boards, meaning we could hear the people in the next rooms conversation and people walking in the room above us. We did have noisy neighbours who were yelling and screaming at 11.30 p.m. so we moved the next day for our last nights stay to Room 546. This was an unfurbished room right next to the lifts but we didnt hear the lifts at all. We really liked this room, it was much bigger and had a wonderful couch and two chairs, plasma/lcd tv, pull down hatch with tea and coffe making facilities, minibar, safe and hairdryer. This room must have had concrete floors covered by carpet as there was no 'creaking'. I think we were extremely lucky to have this room as it was so much nicer than the refurbished room and we appreciated the reception staff organizing the move for us. The bathroom was older but we didnt mind at all. I have attached photos of both rooms to my review.The breakfast was fabulous with everything imaginable on offer. There was fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereals, juices, muffins, croissants, toast, cheese, scrambled eggs, poached eggs, sausages, bacon, black pudding and baked beans. We were offered tea or coffee and my daughter asked for and was given hot chocolate every morning. The male waiters in the restaurant were wonderful, very attentive and extremely pleasant to talk to.We enjoyed our stay at the Rembrandt but the creaky floorboards did really annoy us.A couple of tips: If you come out the South Kensington Station and up the steps, turn right and you come out at Thurloe Square where there are loads of restaurants  Pizza/Pasta, Japanese, Asian, Pancakes and lots of small convenience type stores. To your left just on the corner is a great internet/phone store which charge 1GHP for  hour internet use and 1GBP for a 5 minute telephone call to Australia."
75,1264,"Apr 24 2008	Highly recommend this hotel	This was a repeat visit to the hotel after initially staying on a friend's recommendation last autumn. The hotel is well placed for the various museums - the V&amp;A, the Natural History, the Science Museum. It is a short walk to Hyde Park, the Albert Hall and down to Harrods and a good 30 mins walk along to Oxford Street. The rooms are all being refurbished and are well presented with excellent bathroom facilities and flat screen TV's, tea/coffee trays and the quiet rooms at the back overlook some gardens and some small mews houses/Embassy buildings.We have stayed in a both a 'standard' room and an 'Executive King', and both were really good sizes. Breakfast is a serve-yourself buffet with the usual choices. We ate in one evening (25% discount for meals in the restaurant before 6.30pm) and it was an excellent 'as much as you want' carvery. 18.50 for two courses - before discount- and for London hotel prices, and the quality of the food - excellent value. However, there are many options for eating out just 4/5 minutes walking up to the underground station. I had been arranging a surprise honeymoon package for a relative before my own March stay with the Rembrandt - and the hotel's guests service manager has been tremendous. Nothing was too much trouble and the hotel even upgraded their room and provided complimentary wine on arrival.In my experience, sadly, it is becoming rarer and rarer to find an hotel that offers VFM, clean and good quality furniture and fittings, quiet rooms with good soundproofing and comfortable beds, and that has staff who are friendly and competent these days - and the Rembrandt offers all this."
76,1264,Apr 24 2008 	Linda Campbell Alabama USA	We traveled to London for a girl trip this month 04/08. We were very pleased with The Rembrandt..the breakfast was good and the staff friendly. We plan to stay at this hotel again in the future. The location is excellent. The area is very safe. The hotel was very helpful in helping us with directions. It is easy to find your way around London. Finding a place to eat around the hotel is not a problem. Check out all the pastries. We are looking forward to our next trip.
77,1264,"Apr 11 2008 	Perfect location and nice hotel	I wanted to spend a few days in London before I came back to the States and got a great deal from British Airways. The hotel is in just a perfect location, just across from the V&amp;A and Museum of Natural History. The neighborhood is kinda upscale, but there were plenty of affordable restaurants, bistros, and cafes to choose from. The room was small, but this is London! Comfortable bed, quiet, plenty of space for my stuff. Breakfast was included and it was quite filling enough each day so that I could lighten up on lunch. Friendly staff, very helpful."
78,1264,"Mar 30 2008 	Much better than expected	London hotel rooms are well known to be small and overpriced, but we were pleasantly surprised during our week long visit recently. The room was nicely sized with comfortable beds and pillows. Our room faced the rear courtyard and was very quiet. If traveling from the US, request a room with US outlets which means you won't require voltage adapters. The outlet is by the desk and there was a master switch behind the desk that needed to be turned on for the outlet to have power. It took the concierge a few minutes to figure out why the outlet had no power. Bring an ethernet cable if you want to use your computer in your room. Wireless access is available in the lounge only. Breakfast was very adequate and dining room staff was pleasant and helpful. The location was excellent if you want to see the museums and shop in Knightsbridge. The South Kensington tube station is a short walk away. We didn't find the wonderful array of cafes near Thurloe Square until our trip was almost over. Harrods is a 10 minute walk away, very convenient. The hotel has two lifts, fantastic shower and bathroom facilities which include a US outlet in the bathroom. The hairdryer was in the desk drawer. Room also had a mini fridge and electric tea pot with everything you need to brew a spot of tea in your room. I will stay here again when I return to London."
79,1264,"Mar 24 2008 	Well placed for Museums	Stayed here for a long weekend when visiting London. Well placed for Nat. Hist. and Vic and Al Museums. The indoor poll is nice, but a bit pricey (you pay 16 extra per day) considering the Hotel was'nt cheap!"
80,1264,"Mar 23 2008 	Very Nice	The hotel is nice , located in knights bridge walking distance from harrods an upscale area , very freindly good breakfast and rooms are very small but adequate excellent Interaactive TV"
81,1264,"Mar 21 2008 	great hotel	Hotel reception very friendly and helpful, room was decent size and very clean. breakfast was great. Couldn't fault the hotel at all.location was good - approx 10 minute walk to harrods, 5 minutes from south kensington tube and a stones throw from the natural history museum. recommended."
82,1264,"Jan 21 2008 	Good Value	We stayed from December 28th to January 3rd. British Airways had a hotel and airfare package, which was a terrific value. A full English breakfast is included. Our room was nicely decorated and clean. The towels were oversized with a nice quality. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The location was excellent with a short walk to So. Kensington tube on the Picadilly line so we had an easy commute from Heathrow. You can catch the Big Bus city tour right outside the hotel. And, if you are so inclined, the bartender makes a very dirty martini."
83,1264,"Jan 20 2008 	Noisy tatty room but decent breakfast	We were expecting a kingsize bed and a fridge - but the room had a std double bed and no fridge. The hotel was vey busy, &amp; when we checked-in we heard another guest being told he could not have the grand room he had booked and he was offered a smaller room instead, so it suggests you may not get the room you have booked. The room was OK, but very noisy as it overlooked the main road, and the windows did not fit properly. The flush on the toilet frequently did not work - it had to be pumped up &amp; down. The room was small and the TV was fixed on the wall at the bottom of the bed. And, as there was only about 2ft between the bottom of the bed and the wall, the TV stuck out - with the result that I banged my head on the TV, when I got up in the night!The breakfast was very good - apart from the coffee, which was very stewed and weak- don't be fooled by the wonderful aroma of freshly roast coffee, as you walk into the dining room at breakfast-time.The hotel was very convenient for the V&amp;A, Science Museum etc - or for Harrods and the shops of Knightsbridge."
84,1264,"Jan 5 2008 	Good hotel but shame about the food	I stayed at the Rembrandt for four nights last month. I was travelling on business and wanted to choose a hotel that was close to Kensington. In terms of the location of this hotel, it is excellent. You are close to Harrods, Kensington and Knightsbridge, and Victoria is only a short taxi ride or a couple of tube stops away. As such, I was perfectly located for business and could walk to all meetings. The room itself was on the small side, but it was perfectly comfortable. There was a good internet/communications package in the room, and it was decorated quite tastefully and had the usual features you would expect from a corporate hotel. While there was no &quot;wow&quot; factor about the place, it was perfectly fine. The aspect which lets this hotel down is the restaurant. While breakfasts were excellent, the restaurant only puts on basic pub grub at lunch and in the evening. This is expensive for what it is and should really be avoided. I arrived late on my first evening and did not want to venture out as it was nearly 10pm. Dinner was served until 10, but I was the only person in the dining room. The staff were surly and unhelpful as if by ordering close to finishing time I was giving them too much work....I ordered a simple pasta dish which came back cold, mushy and worse than I ever cooked as a student. One glass of wine took 15 minutes to arrive, and that too was tasteless and expensive. Suffice it to say that I never went back to the restaurant, and nor did anyone else by the look of the place on subsequent nights. Would I return to this hotel? Possibly, but only if I needed to be around Kensington and everywhere else was full....."
85,1264,"Jan 4 2008 	Deceptive Website	When booking with this Hotel, do not expect to get what you see on their website. The room we were expecting was a spacious room with modern luxuries, the room we got was barely big enough for the bed.The bathroom was also rather dated and not particularly clean, especially around the taps.We were also the only English people in the Hotel (including staff), which can lead to misunderstandings. Such as prices.We were told repeatedly by Hotel staff that car parking would cost us 27 for 24 hours, instead it was 37 for 24 hours. Also, if you want a hot breakfast, you will have to pay an extra 5 per head.The location of the hotel is ok though (near South Kensington Tube) and the Bar in the hotel looks nice.Overal, this hotel was a bit disappointing and not worth it's price-tag, unless you can get a room last minute for about 40."
86,1264,"Jan 3 2008 	Wonderful hotel	Enjoyed an excellent stay in The Rembrandt between Christmas and New Year. Hotel was first class. Absolutely no complaints. Well appointed, spacious bedrooms, friendly, helpful staff and splendid breakfasts. The location is ideal being less than 5 minutes walk to South Kensington Underground Station and the same distance from Harrods and surrounding shops. If you're looking for a top class hotel in London look no further."
87,1264,"Dec 30 2007 	Lovely Hotel for under 100 GBP	The Rembrandt, Knightsbridge, a Savora Hotel, was recommended to me by a colleague for a centrally located hotel for a reasonable price, not that many of those exist in London if you are American and the dollar is in the toilet. The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from Kensington Station and about 5-10 minutes from Harrod's on the same major roadway. The hotel web site says they've undergone renovations recently; the lobby, hallways and rooms were very elegant, contemporary and clean. I booked a single room bed (twin bed) since I was traveling solo on business; the room was still very large with a big desk, flat screen TV, internet access, armoire for clothes, large bath and tub. Tough to find hairdryer in desk drawer but finally did. Also hard to find the safety switch on the clothes iron but did. Very comfortable bed and bed linens. It did seem like a high price in terms of U.S. dollars at almost $200, but this is London, and the dollar is crap. If I go to London again for business, I would definitely stay here. Great front desk and bell stand service too. The taxi driver recommended going over to the green building in the middle of the road in front of the hotel and ordering a bacon sandwhich. I never got the chance, but the little green sandwich shop (TO GO orders only) looked fun."
88,1264,Dec 15 2007 	Fabulous Value	Stayed for 7 nights in October '07. Room was European small but well laid out and efficient. Newly decorated and immaculate. Good bed and linens. Buffet meals were very good. Room service was great and on time. Bar was inviting and friendly. Concierge was over the top helpful. Location close to Harrod's and walk-to Chelsea shopping. Also very close to So Kens Tube. Bus stop and taxi ranks immediately outside. Excellent value.
89,1264,"Dec 4 2007 	Great Hotel Great Location	I booked this hotel as a package through british airways along with my flight and got a very reasonable price for it. We travelled on the gatwick express to Victoria Station which is a 5 minute taxi or tube ride from the hotel - great way to beat the traffic! On arrival at the hotel we were checked in very quickly. Allocated a room on the second floor. Room was clean and new looking (must be one of the upgraded ones) plasma tv, jacuzzi bath and plenty of room for two woman with lots of shopping and two suitcases. Safe easy to work. Room view was disappointing but isn't high on my priorities list, it was very quiet and didn't feel like you were sleeping in the middle of a city! Didn't use minibar but well stocked. Breakfast is served in a gorgeous room, plently to eat and well stocked, it's a buffett so you can have as much or as little as you like. Staff are helpful. My advise is to buy a daily railcard for the tube and walk to south kensington tube station (two minutesto the right of the hotel on leaving) which has trains running on 3 main lines. Only 5 a day and you can pretty much travel anywhere. Harrods is very close (you can see if from the hotel) along with many of the museums. At the back of the hotel you can walk to sloane street and lots of independent chelsea shops - worth a browse! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay again."
90,1264,"Nov 19 2007 	One more noteworthy hotel in London	Spacious and clean room. Furniture and decor not very new. Stuff tried to be helpfull, but not always could manage to do it.Breakfast was nothing special, but enough to fill full.Great location, between South Kensington and Knightsbridge tube stations. Traditional pab and chinese restaurant near the hotel.Sure, 170 GBP (340 USD) per night is very expensice, but it's London..."
91,1264,"Nov 9 2007	Loved the hotel	Okay after reading the other reviews I wonder if I was in the same hotel!! I loved the Rembrandt... My room was brand new and wonderful. I had a huge room, whirlpool tub and was on the 6th floor. I really think all the rooms on the 6th floor are renovated so maybe ask for one of the rooms on that floor.I was in room #674. I found the front desk to be very nice and helpful and always spoke to us. But I am always nice to everyone and maybe they sense that , After England we went to Italy and I had the same good luck with all the rooms I checked into.The breakfast at the Rembrandt was great I thought, I did not not try the dining room in the evening but I can tell you there is a great Italian place right next door. Don't miss it.Rembrandt is in a great location to everything, Tube is 1 block away. I love the tube so east to travel everywhere. Be sure and get a oyster card just put 20 pounds on it that should be enough for 5 t0 7days.Please see my other reviews of my trip to hotels in Italy Hotel Minerva in Florence, Grand Hotel Continental in Siena and Hotel Metropole in Venice. If you want to ask any questions please e-mail me at donatravel@aol.com"
92,1264,"Nov 3 2007 	Average hotel--high price	This hotel was in a great location, but the carpet was tattered, bed linens were a bit scary and staff kept giving me conflicting information. I was there for 3 nights in an old room with very little natural light. The breakfast was nice and the dining area was obviously updated a couple of decades after my room. On the plus side, it was in a good neighborhood and I felt comfortable walking around by myself at night. The front desk personnel would tell me one thing and the consierge would tell me the opposite, so they were not very helpful. For the price I expected much better. I would probably check around for another hotel on my next stay in London."
93,1264,"Oct 29 2007 	Great Location Fawlty Towers uncaring staff - over priced Room 453	Stayed here for two nights during a business trip in room 453. Room ok - tattered carpeting, beat up woodwork and frayed bathrobe aside, once I called the general manager's office (after three calls with no response to hotel front desk) to get the TV and in room safe fixed. Also front desk gave me a key that never worked in the first place. Request to have contents removed from mini bar was never responded to. Towels were brand new (never washed) so ended up covered with white lint for two days - thankfully my business associates had a sense of humor. Meals - buffet breakfast competent, but lounge area meals were dull and service was appalling. Eastern European waiter's reply was a Soviet-surly &quot;I have no idea&quot; regarding availability of wines, cider and how the fish and chips dish was. The bar man stood in plain view of guests picking his nose and his teeth - GROSS. Requests for towels that had been washed and extra toilet paper were met with rolls placed on bathroom counter (I had to install them myself, and towels placed on side of tub, with dirty towels on floor left there in place. Only bright spot were concierge team members who were harried but at least helpful regarding maps, directions, etc.To sum it up - even the location cannot overcome sullen, uncaring staff to justify the prices. Stay over at the Thistle Charring Cross instead and take the bus/tube where you are going (three tube lines underneath).F&amp;B - the Moti Mahal has good and reasonable Indian a few blocks away toward the South Kensington Tube Stop on Glendowner Place. Great Lamb Bhuna, rice, poppa dums and a lager for under 20 pounds for dinner."
94,1264,"Oct 23 2007 	mini bar police	Wonderful location,staff very unhelpful,we left a deposit of fifty pounds at check in during the following day we were summoned to reception to be told we had over exceeded that limit so we paid the outstanding amount only to find the mini bar police arriving at our door to take out the minibar.The whole experiance of a weekend away with my wife(first time in god knows how many years)was completly ruined thanks to the stupid person that thinks procedure is correct and treats paying customers like potential thiefs.Great hotel pathetic staff."
95,1264,"Oct 6 2007 	Practically perfect ...	Having stayed in many different hotels in Central London over the past decade or so, unless there are strong reasons to do otherwise, the Kensington area is always my place of choice from which to use as my base. With this in mind &amp; having looked at everything on offer, The Rembrandt looked a good option at 120 mid-week using a friend's discount &amp; it turned out to be an excellent choice.The location is perfect. Sure, some may prefer to stay right within the bustle of Piccadily &amp; it's immediate vicinity but you just know room sizes and rates wont make it worthwhile so for somewhere that's just a few tube stops away but has plenty of top-class amenities I think the Rembrandt is superb. It's directly across from the V&amp;A Museum which means its a 2 minute walk to the Natural History &amp; Science Museums, 5 minutes to Harrods &amp; 10 minutes to the Royal Albert Hall &amp; Hyde Park. The second you step out of the lobby you can see 3 of the above-mentioned landmarks depending on whether you look left, straigh-ahead or right.The public areas are clean, tasteful &amp; classy, nothing huge but perfectly sized to enjoy a quiet drink or meal &amp; the check-in desk was pleasant &amp; adequately staffed. Our rate included Continental Breakfast although several of us took Full English as there didn't seem to be any policy to differentiate between the two, in all honesty I wish I hadn't bothered as it was probably the only negative of our stay - the food was below average, I've had much nicer in Holiday Inn's, Jury's, etc this year in London. The pastries, juices, etc that would be classed as Continental were fine however - should have stuck to what we'd paid for !Our party contained six people staying in three rooms and of these one room was compact but modern, comfortable &amp; very well equipped, another of the same style &amp; decor but quite a bit more spacey &amp; one &quot;older&quot; room that was easily the best of the three. When asked if the hotel had any more rooms of this style available I was told it was due for refurbishment and classed as a standard room. It's a good sign of any hotel when a room is due for a refurb when it really doesn't need it. It was easily the nicest and largest &quot;standard&quot; hotel room I've seen in Central London, in fact far nicer than any of the times I've stayed in upgraded rooms.All 3 rooms had very new Samsung flat-panel tv's with a full selection of Sky TV channels (including Sports !), superb bathrooms with high-quality fittings &amp; everything else you could ask for. One room had a great view overlooking the V&amp;A Museum whilst the largest room overlooked a scene straight ouf ot &quot;Mary Poppins or Peter Pan&quot;. Very niceTo summarise, the Rembrandt will be the first place I will look for future stays in London. It goes without saying that the price of a night's stay is paramount to any decision when it come to hotel choice but I'd happily pay approx 20/30 per night more to stay here than many of the other chain hotels nearby."
96,1264,"Oct 2 2007 	Great Hotel	Check in and out very swift. Very spacious and modern room - very airy and light with 3 windows. The bed was very comfortable and the large flat screen TV, whirlpool bath and heated towel rails were 'nice' touches. The room facilities were excellent overall, although I did find the aircon a little noisy, but not enough to bother to work out how to switch it off! Lots of choice for breakfast, which was tasty. The Hotel Bar had a real sense of ambience. All in all, a great hotel - would definitely stay again."
97,1264,"Sep 29 2007 	A great hotel and an even greater location	Do not let the negative reviews scare you away. Unless your expecting a five star hotel, this hotel is wonderful. It's not the Ritz but it's not a Motel6 either. First , my background. We are a midwest working class couple in our early 40's. No kids, first time in London. The location of this hotel cannot be beat. We stayed here for 12 nights. Flying into Heathrow you take the tube( Piccadilly line ) to the South Kensington stop, walk 5 minutes and your there.It is a direct train with no changes. It takes about 45 minutes to get from the airport to the hotel. Simple and very, very convenient! The only problem we had was we booked the airfare and hotel thru British Airways about 3 months before we left home and requested a early check in. When we arrived at the hotel around 10am they told us they had no room available yet. Fortunately there is so much to see in this area. We headed RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET to the Victoria and Albert museum. This place is great and we spent our time there until a room became available. Also across the street is the Natural History museum, the Science museum and a great old Catholic church called the Brompton Oratory. About 5 blocks behind the museums are Hyde Park, the Albert memorial, Kensington Palace and Albert Hall. The neighborhood is great. Safe and close to Harrods and tons of restaurants and pubs, We even walked to the Hard Rock Cafe from the hotel which is about 1 easy mile away. We had a UN-REFURBISHED room at the hotel. Well the room was perfect. It was warm and inviting. It had two twin beds pushed together which made it like a king bed. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows were perfect.The sheets were crisp and clean. In fact sometimes I didn't even want to get out of bed in the morning. The room was not cramped whatsoever and it even had doors that opened to a balcony that overlooked the museums across the street. The a/c was a digital thermostat and worked great everyday. The room also included a hair dryer,a 27 inch flat screen television, coffee and tea,an in room safe and even a pants press. It didn't have a mini fridge which would of been nice. The were plenty of drawers for clothes. The bathroom had plenty of counter space and upscale toiletries. The shower was very powerful, even better then my home shower. The shower/tub did have a straight curtain rod instead of the newer curved ones to keep the curtain off of you. Breakfast was included everyday in their restaurant from 7am until 10am. It was a full buffet breakfast which just some of the items were eggs ( two different ways ) two kinds of sausage, ham, assorted cereals, juices, toast, etc. It kept us full most of the day and saved us money. We didn't try the bar or restaurant since there are so many choices in this neighborhood to choose from. They also have a pool in their lower floor but it cost's an extra 7 1/2 pounds a day, plus who goes swimming in London? The staff was friendly and helpful and our room was kept spotless everyday. What we want in a hotel is a clean room with a comfortable bed. We got it here and even more. If you looking for the same with a great location to explore London from, then this is it. If you are looking for door greeters, bellhops, room service, spas to be pampered and like to nit pick then the Ritz might be better for you. Hope this info helps you decide if this place is for you."
98,1264,"Sep 25 2007 	Loved this location	We stayed at this hotel three times over 5 weeks as we came and went from London as a base. We found this hotel to be in an excellent location, easy to get to from Heathrow as you just stay on the Picadilly line and don't need to change and as this was our first time in London it made things easier. Just have to lug suitcases up stairs though at the South Kensington Station. Rembrandt is very close to the station, a mere five minute walk. Also close to many wonderful museums, the lovely Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Close to lovely restaurants and a lovely old pub called The Bunch of Grapes where we had a couple of great nights.The beds were comfy, nice fresh linen and towels. We had an executive room, I saw the superior rooms which were quite small which would be ok for one night but for longer as we had 7 days, then 3 days and then 4 days I am glad we had the larger room. We also had one of the refurbished rooms, I believe you have to request one of these, the refurbishment of the hotel is not complete.Breakfast was nice enough,plenty of choices. The area of Knightsbridge and South Kensington is really nice,many beautiful buildings. I would recommend this hotel very highly."
99,1264,"Sep 23 2007 	wonderful location	We couldnt have wished for a better location , room very average but bed comfortable enough, breakfast very nice but little things like table clothes wouldnt go a miss! On the whole would recommend for its location alone , walking in kensington gardens after breakfast was wonderful."
100,1264,"Sep 9 2007 	Loved The Rembrandt	We have a 10 yr old and like to stay in kid-friendly hotels. This hotel not only has exellent location but has very friendly staff. We arrived about 6 hours before the check-in time. They found us a room and put our luggage in there and then when our assigned room was avaialble they moved the luggage. This hotel is probably has one of the most convenient locations for a tourist. This hotel is close to the tube station, bus-stop that can take right away to the theater district and on and on...... We had the option of free breakfast and free dinner at the hotel. Short walk to Harrods is nice. Overall a great experience!!!!!"
101,1264,"Aug 26 2007 	A great find	My husband and I typically prefer smaller hotels, but travelling with two teens(15 &amp; 18), we picked the Rembrandt for it's very competitive price, location and amenities. Location is wonderful. As others have mentioned, it is 5 minutes from the S. Kensington tube station, 8-10 minutes from the Albert memorial, Albert Hall, Science museum, Victoria and Albert museum and Harrods(although why anyone would want to battle the Harrods' crowds I can't imagine!). In front of the hotel are bus stops for buses that can take you anywhere in central London. You can also pick up one of the &quot;Big Bus&quot; open-top buses that provide narrated tours around the city. We stayed at the Rembrandt for 6 days. We enjoyed it thoroughly. We had one executive double room and one standard. Both were clean, comfortable and attractively arrranged. The bathrooms were modern, with upscale fixtures. The executive was larger and more luxurious. Both rooms were air conditioned adequately (remember this is Europe, a/c is rarely like the states). The hotel staff was polite and helpful. Service was consistent with a three-star hotel. A malfunctioning a/c was fixed while we were out one day. A broken door lock proved a little more of a challenge, but was eventually resolved. The desk staff were happy to be able to accomodate our early check-in request. In answer to those reviewers who complained about small shabby rooms, we noticed that there is rennovation going on in the hotel, so I would reccommend requesting a recently updated room. Also, make sure breakfast is included in your rate, we paid for the breakfast buffet the morning we arrived and it was well over $100 for 4 of us!! Breakfast buffet was fine although hot food was quite greasy and overcooked. We would definately return to the Rembrandt."
102,1264,"Jul 18 2007 	Good but could improve	Stayed for 4 nights with wife, 2 yr old and another couple for sightseeing and visiting in London. First the bad - the hotel is right in downtown London but not really close to sights - a long 5 blocks to Harrods, or 4 blocks to a tube station with a toddler in a stroller - not that easy. We took taxis everywhere which worked fine for us and there are always some going by the front door. Our room was in the front of the hotel - the old origional part of the hotel and had a very squeaky floor under the carpets which was very annoying and a hassle trying to walk lightly enough to not wake up our little one. Our companions had a room in the rear of the hotel - newer part of hotel that had no such problem. No internet connection or wireless in our room but they do have two computer stations in the lobby with internet access that worked very well. Now the good - service from all the personnel was excellent and all were very friendly and eagar to help. The included breakast buffet was very nice but ends a 10:00am a little early for us, but OK. The rooms were clean and functional and the baths were very nice. Overall a pretty good value in downtown London and we would recommend."
103,1264,"Jul 8 2007 	Favorite London Hotel	Given a choice and enough advance notice, this is my favorite place to stay in London on business and even when I am in town to sightsee. It is close to Harrods, a huge plus in my mind. It also has a great health club located in the hotel that lets me keep up my daily routine of exercise, including swimming and a great spa area to end the day in.The rooms aren't exceptional, but they are highly functional and the beds are great. This is one hotel I never have a hard time falling asleep in.There is only one restaurant here, but given that it is in Knightsbridge, that hardly matters, there are many great ones within a half mile of walking."
104,1264,Jul 5 2007 	Smallest room we have ever stayed in	The staff provided no assistance and were very offhanded.We were not given the type of room we were guaranteed even though I personally visited the hotel 2 weeks before to confirm our reservation.Four times the check in staff provided wrong advice and we were put in the smallest room that we have ever stayed in-anywhere.Definitely not 4 star.Would not stay there again.
105,1264,Jun 30 2007 	Anadequate Knightsbridge hotel!	Our stay was quite comfortable and we enjoyed the large spacious ' deluxe room' with bathroom. The hotel is well located within walking distance of Harrods and the Underground. It is surrounded by many good restaurants of all price ranges.Hotel service is best described as off hand for a hotel of this professed standard and assistance on the sidewalk on arrival and with baggage is missing. There is no doorman.Breakfast is institutional and disappointing. Better value is available outside the hotel.Decor and ambience is aged and some new colours and modernisation would be appropriate to lift what could be a fine property.
106,1264,"Jun 24 2007 	Not a 4star!	We have just returned from our stay at the Rembrandt and have to say that I was vey disappointed.The reviews on Tripadvisor gave me the impression this would be a great place to take my girlfriend for her birthday. What we did discover was a very basic hotel, our room was very basic and in desperate need of decoration. The bathroon was even worse, looking like it was last re-fitted in the late 70's!To add insult to injury we booked a queen room and ended up with a twin!Location is great, yes. The Victoria and Albert museum is just across the road and the Royal Albert Hall a short taxi ride away.Not worth 150 a night, more like 70,"
107,1264,"Jun 21 2007	Perfect location	An earlier reviewer mentioned his shabby room and questioned if other rooms had been renovated. I believe indeed they had. My wife and I stayed at the Rembrandt for three nights and booked an &quot;Executive&quot; room. After a long oversees flight, we were assigned to a first floor room, which was very cramped, dark, and dingy . Worst of all, it was a smoking room and smelled the part. We then requested another room and you'd think we stepped into another hotel. The new room on the 4th floor was was absolutely beautiful and spacious. In fact, another room on our floor was being renovated during our stay (not noisy). SO YES! Make sure you get a renovated room. Once we were settled, we loved this hotel. Very good staff. Excellent health club facility. Clean. Great breakfast buffet each morning. Guests include a lot of business travelers.But best of all, I think, is the location. Situated in a very nice ,leafy part of London, it's close to beautiful parks, shopping (Harrods!) , museums, and the tube for convenient travel anywhere in London. We will definitely stay at the Rembrandt next time in London."
108,1264,"Jun 17 2007 	A nice surprise	The Rembrandt turned out to be a nice surprise. Had some concerns initially but a very good experience. Very close to S Kensington Tube Station. Oyster Card easy to purchase and useHotel staff all helpful, though not terribly knowledgable. They get high marks for good attitude. The room was comfortable and clean...with safe and minibar. Good breakfast buffet..something for everyone. Several restaurant choices nearby...but Racine (french) an excellent choice."
109,1264,"Jun 17 2007 	Slightly disappointing	In 2000 I stayed at this hotel and, at the time, it was fabulous. It was well maintained; the breakfast buffet was excellent; and the overall appearance of the hotel was impressive. I was slightly disappointed when I arrived there with three colleagues and found that, although the lobby had been remodeled and there was free internet service there, things just weren't the same. Upon my arrival, I was placed in a first-floor room with no air conditioning. (I asked to be moved to a higher floor the next day.) The decor hadn't changed since the early 1990s, I think. I was looking forward to the breakfast buffet and found only a skimpy, low-quality assortment of English breakfast standards. The rooms were clean. But the linens and the furniture are in need of an update. I'm assuming that the hotel chain just bank s on the fact that the hotel is in a prime spot in Knightsbridge (across from the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum)."
110,1264,"Jun 5 2007 	grim	Did we stay in a different hotel... the name and address are the same so perhaps not, but I cannot believe the good reviews. We stayed one night in April, the room and bathroom was so dated, shabby, grubby, dingy and depressing that we asked to be moved before we unpacked. The dirty window overlooked a dank shaft containing various plant/pipes/cigarette butts etc. We were willing to pay more to change rooms but none were available and it was too late to arrange another hotel. I felt robbed and had to complain but nothing could be done. I have stayed in four London hotels so far this year and this is the only one I am dissatisfied with.I imagine - from reading other reviews - some of the hotel rooms must have been refurbished, so my advice is if you do choose to stay here, you must check you will have an updated room. Or check in early enough to check out again before you have to sleep there."
111,1264,"Jun 2 2007 	Pleasant convenient reasonable--what else can you want?	We stayed five nights at the Rembrandt and we were well pleased with every element of our stay. Although not large (it's London, after all), the room was well arranged and had everything clean, comfortable, and in working order. (Hair dryer is in a desk drawer, but luckily I found it before I needed to use it.) The staff were all pleasant and helpful. We did not find one who could not speak English and understand our Southern American accents. The concierge was especially capable.The full English breakfast was quite good. We ate one dinner in the restaurant and enjoyed that, too. Like most English food, and also like food from a buffet, none of it is amazing, but it met our expectations.Location can't be beat. Taxis are plentiful, perhaps because a cute little green house in the middle of the street directly in front of the hotel serves as a tea-and-snack stand for taxi drivers.We want to stay at the Rembrandt again. Just hope all these nice reviews won't cause them to push up the prices!"
112,1264,"Jun 2 2007 	The Rembrandt superb location at Thurloe Place beside Brompton Road	We stayed here for 3 nights in June. 145 per night for 2 people with breakfast.The location is perfect, it is right across the road from the front of the V&amp;A Musuem and only 5 mins walk from South Kensington Tube Station. The Brompton Road is 1 minute away, Harrods is 10 mins very pleasant stroll and Hyde Park is about 15 mins lovely walk. Our trip included a concert at Royal Albert Hall, and this hotel is a very pleasant 15 minutes also.Check in was easy, friendly and efficient. We had requested a room on a high floor (there are 5 floors), we got a room on the second floor, but as it turned out it was perfect so we were not disappointed that our request was not met. However I do think that on check in we should have been given a reason why it was not met. The foyer is stylish and welcoming.We had room 267 - perfect for a great nights sleep as it overlooks a private mews with no through traffic. Two full length french doors overlook this mews and allow access onto a narrow balcony (which we only found out about on our last day!) I slept like a baby. The room is a nice size, has everything you will need for a pleasant stay. The Bathroom in this room, while well appointed (including Jacuzzi bath) and spotlessly clean is small but perfectly adequate. The mini bar was annoying from the point of view that we never purchase from a mini bar and there was no room for our shop bought bottled water which we needed in the warm weather. The hotel should provide some space in their mini bar for this. In fact a mini bar should be an option for residents.Breakfast in the Masters restaurant was very well presented. My travelling partner was not impressed but I tucked into the generous helpings of fruit, juices, hot food, pastries etc. It is self service, so there is a lot of to'ing and fro'ing. The tea came in a pot while the coffee came by the cup which meant you had to keep beckoning the waiting staff for refills, that was annoying for someone who likes at least two cups in the morning. I would suggest the hotel also serve the coffee in individual pots.We dined one night in the Conservatory Lounge bar which is spacious and very comfortable. The staff there were attentive. Two mains and 4 beers cost 46 including tip. The food was very pleasant and I would recommend it.One slight disappointment was the leisure centre (Aquilla Health club) which was charging 7.50 for a swim. This is described by the hotel as a nominal fee. Not so. The pool is not designed for lane swimming, so I went to the nearby Chelsea Leisure Centre where a proper swim cost me 3.30. Checkout was as efficient as Check in but there was a mini bar charge which I asked them to remove and they did so without question. We did not use the mini bar, or so we thought until we had a think about it later on and realised that in fact we might well have, but that's another story altogether.The Rembrandt comes well recommended if it is in your price range. I would definitely return."
113,1264,"May 29 2007 	Very nice hotel in a great location.	We booked this hotel as it is walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall. With mixed reviews from previous visitors we really didn't know what to expect. I must say I was very impressed with this place!! The desk staff were particulary attentive and nothing was to much trouble, the rooms were large and clean and the breakfast was more than adequate. Saying that we had it included and would not have been happy to pay 17 on top.All in all a good hotel in a good location, clean &amp; friendly."
114,1264,"May 4 2007 	Great choice!	My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Rembrandt and thouroughly enjoyed it. The location was fantastic. The underground was across the street and the restaurants were excellent. The hotel was clean and the room was exactly what we had asked for. The staff dealt with any problems immediately and the concierge was very helpful. The breakfast was good, but the wait staff were not very friendly or helpful. Otherwise, a good experience and would definitely stay there again."
115,1264,"May 3 2007 	You won't be disappointed at the Rembrandt	We spent one full week here. and because of a nightmare 2 day flight from CA, we checked in at 2:00 am with no problems at all. My sister and I chose this hotel because of it's wonderful location; directly across from the V&amp;A museum; a stone's throw to Harrod's food halls; many choices for casual restaurants and pubs a block or two away; and a lovely 5 minute stroll on tree lined streets to the tube (which sits in the middle of one might think is a small village with grocery, drug, and boutique stores). Rooms were perfectly fine for a European room, clean, nicely furnished, super clean baths with tub and showers. Front desk and concierge especially helpful when Eurostar cancelled all travel for 24 hours to Paris. The concierge spent at least one hour on two different telephones trying to find us a flight out - unbelievable! They couldn't have been more accommodating. The breakfast room was unlike any I had been in before - not some dark corner room, but a sun filled large dining room with plenty of tables, no waiting ever, serving a large buffet of hot and cold items with table service for beverages. The lounge was quite large, with a full bar serving light fare or anything from the dinner menu. It also had a woodburning fireplace with comfy sofas and chairs. All of these amenities came at a price that I would have expected to pay almost double for. You won't be disappointed in London with this hotel."
116,1264,"Apr 17 2007 	Very good hotel. Superb location.	We stayed for one night only. The hotel is situated right opposite the V &amp; A museum and very close to the Science Museums, Harrods and the Albert Hall. Very friendly staff, quick check-in and out and nice clean bedroom. Double room was on the fourth floor with views over the rooftops of London, interesting but not to everybody's taste (see photo).Reasonably priced (125) which included full English breakfast for both of us. Drinks are not cheap, typical London prices. You can park under the hotel, with 10 off for staying there (Congestion charge applies).We had a very pleasant stay, and I recommend this hotel most highly."
117,1264,"Apr 10 2007 	Average hotel great location	We spent two nights at the Rembrandt at the beginning of April. We had booked a 'superior' room, but the room was smaller than expected. However, it was clean and everything worked including the jacuzzi bath. It was around the corner from the lift and although this concerned me we were not disturbed by any noise from it.The breakfast room is lovely and bright. The hot and cold breakfast selection is good but a number of items were not 'fresh' e.g. the fruit selection included tinned pears, plums as well as the usual grapefruit. Juices were all from concentrates and even some of the breads seemed to be of the 'long life' variety. Only the sliced melon was actually fresh apart from a bowl of apples.Service in the hotel was friendly and efficient. It is really the hotel's location that makes it worth returning to. It is across the road from the V&amp;A museum, convenient to the South Kensington tube station, a few blocks from Harrods and surrounded by nice coffee shops and interesting looking pubs."
118,1264,"Apr 6 2007 	Great location Good not perfect hotel	We were at The Rembrandt for five nights in late March. I booked this hotel based mostly on location, but splurged for the &quot;double executive&quot; room. We arrived at the hotel at 9:30 am after a redeye, planning on stowing luggage until check-in. But the desk clerk called housekeeping and they readied our room in about 25 minutes while we decompressed in the lounge. The room was lovely, tho' the view out the window was the drab air and light shaft down the middle of the building. That wasn't a big deal--the room was probably quieter as a result. Huge, comfy bed with nice linens and comforter. Separate seating area with sofa, two chairs and writing desk. Credenza dividing the two areas, with TV on a lazy susan (with limited channels and pay movies). Hot pot and teas, and a small (not stocked) refrigerator in the credenza. Large, clean bath has jetted tub with a good-pressure, wall-mounted shower head. Full range of toiletries provided. Housekeeping was attentive on weekdays. We noticed the weekend staff didn't seem as meticulous. Not much noise through the walls or ceiling. Our biggest complaint regards noise from the hall. Voices carry. The doors are on automatic closers, and when they bang shut the noise is loud! At all hours, the banging doors were jarring and even woke us up. It's my biggest reservation about recommending this hotel.The breakfast buffet did have a decent selection for both the continental and English options, tho there was no variation day to day. Find a booking site that includes breakfast. Many don't, and you won't want to spend 14.95 Continental or 17.95 English--that's pounds sterling--for this buffet. The breakfast staff was basically efficient, but at busy times getting a pot of tea was difficult, and one morning never arrived. The lounge is very attractive, but the smoking and non-smoking areas are separate in name only. The haze and odor drift throughout.The front desk clerks and concierges were always friendly and helpful. The 14 bus out front goes straight through Picadilly and near Leicester Square. The Victoria &amp; Albert across the street is free, so when the spouse needs a nap but you don't, pop in there for an hour or so. Definitely get an Oyster card for travel. Our 7 day pass cost about 23(?) pounds each, and covered buses, Tube and the Docklands light rail, plus a third off a Thames boat trip."
119,1264,"Apr 2 2007 	Very nice hotel!	My family and I stayed in the Rembrandt for 9 nights and enjoyed every minute of it. We booked three rooms and the staff was able to get all the rooms near each other so I didn't have to worry too much about the kids. The location of the hotel is great. It is a short walk away from the South Kensington underground station and three different buses lines stop almost in front of the hotel doors. Harrods is right down the street and there are many small local shops nearby. A short walk from the hotel (in the direction of Harrods) is a very nice pastry shop with wonderful pastries and tea for an evening snack.The staff was very nice and helpful, especially Celio and Pablo. They were able to give us directions to all the sights we visited and even made last minute dinner reservations at a local restaurant. Breakfast was nice and there was something for everyone, even my three kids. Usually my kids are picky eaters but they managed to eat a full breakfast from the choices on the buffet. My only complaint about the hotel is the pool. Yes, there is a charge to use the pool and we did use it three nights. But children cannot be in the pool after 7 pm on weeknights. We spent most of the day out in the city visiting the tourist sights and by the time we returned back to the hotel after having dinner it was usually past 6 pm and it wasn't worth spending all that money to use the pool for only 30-45 minutes. I did take the kids to the pool one night at 6:30 pm only because they were very good all day and really wanted to go swimming. They got to spend 30 minutes swimming and were very disappointed having to get out.All in all, if I were to ever go back to London, I would stay at the Rembrandt again. I feel that the hotel was worth the price and my family had a great time."
120,1264,"Mar 31 2007 	great location big room good value	My husband and I stayed here 4 nights in late March 07 for vacation. The location is excellent--right across the street from Victoria and Albert museum, two minute walk from the South Kensington tube station (the underground is VERY easy to figure out and use, especially with an Oyster card), and on excellent bus routes. Pleasant walk to Harrod's, plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby, very safe, not overly busy neighborhood. Of course, we weren't visiting in high season. The room was large by European standards, clean, with a brand new and quite nice bathroom-excellent water pressure. Other rooms were being renovated in the hotel but we never heard construction--probably because we were out and about as much as possible! The A/C is loud if you turn it up (good for drowning out noise if you want to sleep in), but can be adjusted. The excellent breakfast buffet, with all kinds of hot and cold options, was included. Nice bar/lounge area where you can get a late drink in front of the fire, served with 'biscuits' (cookies). Staff was professional, but we didn't have much interaction with them. I would stay here again, and hope to next year with our 3 children. Connecting rooms are available. Never even looked at the spa and pool, but I'd go to Arizona for that sort of thing, not London. Got good rate through aboutrooms.com linked through tripadvisor."
121,1264,"Mar 27 2007 	OK except for noisy aircon pay extra to use Spa and Internet	I booked this hotel for a one night stay prior to a course in London. I was drawn by the pool facility and the area. It was an OK enough stay but, like so many UK hotels, I thought it was little more than average and I was dissappointed that one had to pay extra to use the Spa and pool as well as the internet.The reader may wish to take note that I do not generally like hotels in the UK anyway, especially London hotels, but why should one not expect that bit more for the price you pay?I booked over the internet, by the hotel website, the day before but got to the hotel to find there was no record of my booking. The reception staff were efficient enough to find me a room anyway but I could not help think that this could have been disasterous at a very busy time of year. I did have my laptop with me with the relavent email proving my booking.The first room I was shown was quite spacious and very clean but it had a lovely view into the centre of the hotel and the workings of the hotel heating system (why do hotels do this or why do they charge the same for rooms with a poor view?). It was a bit dark but would have stood for one night. However, I could not find the socket to attach the cable for internet connection (no wireless internet connection here) and so I asked for a change of room. The second room, the one I settled on, had a lovely westerly view over the V and A and across the rooftops of Kensington. It was smaller but better appointed. It was also very clean. There was an impressive size safe big enough to take a laptop.I used room service to order a salad with tuna mayonaise. The sald was very freshly cut although did arrive without the dressing that was stated on the menu; I was a bit pushed for time so I did not pursue this. The person whom I ordered from did not understand what a bitter beer was; he only thought that the hotel had lager and Guiness. He did phone me back though to say they had Tetleys and was that OK!I though I would have more time than I did and so I would have used the pool. I was put off, however, at having to pay 7-50 (&quot;reduced rate for hotel guests for 24 hour access&quot;) for what would have been less than an hour's use. WHY ON EARTH should hotel customers have to pay extra for the pool? I was dissappointed not to be able to book a massage as the bookings were full; this is an experience that I have had elsewhere. Hotels advertise such facilities but pitch up and the bookings are full; what's the point?Internet access was by Mycloud and so I had to pay, again, for that. I think that The Rembrandt Hotel should catch up with other simular hotels in London and UK and offer complimentary wireless internet access in ALL rooms.Staff were friendly and helpful.The aircon was very noisy but I was very tired and so slept well (I should have taken notice of this from another review. It would have been very tryng for more than one or two nights.In summary, if The Rembrandt Hotel 1. Had complimentary wireless internet access2. Did not charge extra for the pool or Spa.3. Sorted out the noisy heating,it would be great, otherwise I doubt that I would stay there again.The area is lovely and better than the very centre of London.I was amused to see the Kazakhstan embassy next door but I did not see Borat hanging around!"
122,1264,"Mar 5 2007 	Fantastic value for area - No complaints.	A perfectly located 4 star hotel.ROOM: We booked a 'Grand Room' directly with the hotel for the weekend (Fri - Sun) for 2 adults, 1 child. Breakfast and access to Leisure centre was included in our rate. The room was quite spacious &amp; the bed enormous (so enormous that our 11 year old decided to get into our very comfy bed to sleep and still left loads of room for us... consequently the made up sofabed was returned to its sofa status. See pics) Room facilities included a standard tv (not plasma in this room, though I believe some have) with the usual selection of English speaking TV channels + some pay per view movies etc. There's a minibar, stocked at your request, so you can use it as a private fridge (very handy!, I DO hope they keep on this facility), tea/coffee making facilities, iron and ironing board, room safe and hairdryer. Decor was reasonable &amp; a nice note welcomed us with a selection of fresh fruit on our arrival.AIRCON: Bit noisy. You may need to mess around with it to make sure you're getting cold air and not warm as it's not clear from the dials which way to turn it!. We boiled initially, but worked it out in the end.BATHROOM: The bathroom was huge with a large frosted window giving lots of natural light. The spa bath looked fine, though we didn't actually switch it on as we used the leisure centre instead, and showered in room after. The shower is over the bath.. Supplies incude dental kit, shaving kit and Gilchrist and Soames toiletries. The floor was marble effect. It's all nice and clean. Plenty of towels, 2 bathrobes and slippers included. VIEW: The view was poor from our sleeping room (366) - The window in this room is smallish and the natural light was further reduced as we faced an interior square showing the rather drab back of buildings - when we go again, I'll be a bit more picky about which side of the hotel I'm on... the front of the hotel definitely gets lots of sun, but there's lots of traffic that side. However, in the scheme of things it didn't really matter.BREAKFAST: Fine... buffet selection of Full English Breakfast, stewed fruits/yoghurts, breads, continental style hams/cheese, juices, cereals, pastries. Tea/coffee. Tea wasn't great, but I think that's the London water, coffee I was told was good.STAFF: Excellent - no complaints at all. Helpful and pleasant. This is not a 'snobbish' hotel, and has a relaxing balance between formal and casual. You'll feel at ease.BAR AREA: Nice and comfy. Can't wait till they ban public area smoking in England though!. They do have non-smoking areas.LEISURE CENTRE: Good facility - Pool is smallish with 1.5m depth, so don't expect to do laps - but after a long day walking it's all very welcome, and there's a hot jacuzzi off the pool - Kids are most welcome with unlimited access time on Sat/Sun and up till 7pm in the week. Sauna and Steam rooms are in the changing rooms (not mixed sex). There's also a Gym, with the usual selection of machines, plus normal array of spa treatments on offer. Take a 1 coin with you for the lockers. LOCATION: This area is just the best in my view. Located where Thurloe Place meets Cromwell Gardens. Having lived in London for many years, I'd actually choose this area to live in if I return. Hotel is just PERFECTLY placed for visiting the museums (great for rainy day/kids...!)... simply cross the road to enter the V&amp;A Museum, &amp; when you've had your fill, go out the side door, straight over the road into the Natural History Museum and on from there it's a teeny walk into the Science Museum. 5 -8 mins sees you to Harrods, Armani and Hyde Park.... For your snack supply, there's a small M&amp;S and Sainsbury's on opposite sides of the road just before you hit Harrods. It's also not too far from the Kings Road either - easily walkable - we ate at the Big Easy on Kings Road, which has a live band and great crab shack style food, but whatever your tastes are there's a huge choice of restaurants at hand.TRANSPORT: Excellent. It's a 4 - 5 mins walk to South Kensington Tube Station from/to the hotel, which gives you access to the District, Circle and Piccadilly Lines. Whatever London airport you use (we came in from Stanstead this time) you can get to the hotel fairly simply. It's only a short direct tube trip to the West End (4 stops to Piccadilly Circus).EXTRA INFO: We did a great walking trip from hotel which I recommend on a nice day - Walk down to Harrods - do a bit of shopping - then continue on a short while until you see the Mandarin Oriental Hotel opposite, cross over to Hyde Park behind this hotel, and take a right through Hyde Park. When you get to the end of the park, you reach Wellington arch, buy an Ice-cream under the arch, and then cross the road continuing on to Buckingham Palace. Opposite the palace, follow the lake towards Horse Guards Parade through St James' Park (bring some monkey nuts with you for the squirrels - they'll take them out your hand, and bread for the birds), let the kids play in the small playground whilst you have a coffee from the stand. At Horse Guards, follow on left and round the corner to Trafalgar Square and finally up into Piccadilly Circus - get the tube back to hotel. There are so many points of interest to stop off at on this walk. Look it up on mapquest or multimap.* Small warning * When we arrived, there was fairly constant banging from the 4th floor (apparently they were putting in more spa baths) - which I was not informed of when booking - When I asked about the noise, they thought it was going to go on from 9am - 5pm over the whole weekend - but thank heavens it actually it didn't and only lasted until 5pm Friday! They did offer to move us to an 'Executive room' at reduced cost as they had no more Grands available - but when I went to see the room its size was a good bit smaller, so we decided to stay put. Whatever happened, we probably wouldn't be in for most of the 'building/banging' time anyway.I just love London... so much to see and do... can't wait to go back!!. My Favourite City."
123,1264,"Mar 5 2007	Too expensive for Travel Lodge quality	My partner and I stayed at the Rembrandt Hotel on March 3rd for one night. To start with I am not one to complain but was thoroughly dissapointed with so many aspect of my stay. We checked in and went to our room, we opened the door and the room stunk of smoke...after requesting a non-smoking room, the room was a real dissapointment, it was no better than a Travel Lodge. We requested a spa bath when we booked which we did have in our room on arrival but one of the function knobs was broken and it didn't really work properly. Also, the radio in the bathroom did not work. The only good aspect about the room was the huge bed which was comfortable. After a dissapointing start, later that evening we wanted to use the pool, which was the main reason I chose that hotel, we found out that the use of the pool was not included in the price of our stay (170.00) and it would cost 15 to use the pool for one day! That evening we went down to eat in the resturant to find that we were unable to due to a wedding reception being held in there. We were so angry that we had not been informed of this when booking or on arrival to the hotel. In the morning the brekfast was cold and not what you would expect from a suposed luxury hotel. This is just some of the many things that made our stay at the hotel an awful one. To top it all off the staff were rude and not helpful at all. I won't be recommending this hotel that's for sure!"
124,1264,"Mar 3 2007 	Perfect Location	We stayed for two nights at the Rembrandt - booking directly with them after shopping around in the internet.When we arrived at lunchtime, we were seen to immediately and asked if we would like a room at the front or the back. We chose a room at the front and this was immeditely across from the beautiful V and A Museum. The room (superior twin) was absolutely lovely and fnished to perfection. The bath was a jacuzzi bath which was very nice and also had a powerful shower if you preferred. It was very clean and modern with nothing out of place or in need of repair - unusual for most hotel rooms really.The hotel is approx 300 metres from Harrods and when you come out of the entrance on an evening, you can see it all lit up in its glory! It's also across the road from the Science and History Museums - faultless for its location. Used both the Sth Kensington and Knightsbridge Tube Stations.Really, it is what one expect from a 4 star hotel - the only meal we had was breakfast but there was lots to chose from - from cooked english to fresh fruit, muffins, pastries, cereals etc etc.Would definitely stay here again, there are some lovely restaurants and shops nearby - you could walk to most places. The Patisserie Valerie just between the hotel and Harrods is fab with amazing food and pastries and not expensive for a treat!! The hotel bar is also excellent if you want a glass of wine and a few nibbles before going out and again, pretty reasonable to say it is a hotel bar - same prices as a pub.All in all, very happy and pleasantly surprised by our stay at The Rembrandt."
125,1264,"Mar 1 2007 	fine hotel	Stayed three nights Feb 2007 in one of the executive doubles. Room was spacious,clean and quiet (we had a room at the back of the hotel). Breakfast was a bit chaotic at times but the food was fine.All in all a decent four star hotel - in an excellent location."
126,1264,"Feb 26 2007	watch the phone charges!!!!	We stayed for several days last summer. The property was fine, and the location great, but we were intensely dissatisfied with the service. On checking out, we found a charge of over 33 pounds (!) for a 13 minute call to a local mobile phone. The hotel manager told us that the card in our room warned us calls to mobiles might be very expensive, and would go no farther than to reduce the charge by half-- still around $30 for a short local call!! As it turned out, the card in the room said 1 pound is typical for a 3 minute local call, and said NOTHING about higher rates for calls to mobile phones.The moral: even in these days of nearly free phone calls, hotel calls can still be unbelievably expensive, and if you are staying at the Rembrandt, don't expect to be treated honestly or fairly about the charges!"
127,1264,Feb 25 2007 	Loved the rembrandt	Stayed for five nights.booked through BA holidays for 88 GPB per night + continental breakfast.Very good hotel in excellent location! Bus stop right outside. Bus 74 to Marble Arch + baker street.Bus 14 to Picadilly circus and Charring cross road (very near to covent garden!) Night buses also.500 m from south kensington station (Picadilly line to Heathrow terminals) and also district and circle lines.Hotel staff very helpfulRooms very clean and spacious.Breakfast very good both continental and EnglishWhat else can we sayWill try and stay there again!Philip &amp; Irsa Cyprus
128,1264,"Feb 24 2007 	Really Liked the Rembrandt	We just came back from a 5 night stay in London at the Rembrandt. We booked through BA and got a pretty good deal. We found the hotel to be excellent in most ways; Clean, comfortable, warm and modernized rooms. Efficient, helpful and friendly staffs at the front desk and for the cleaning . Within 5 minute walk to the South Kensington Tube station and the wonderful and some reasonable restaurants near there. Our stay came with a continental breakfast - which was upgraded to full English for free, although we didn't realize it was free until checkout. The food was uninspired, but since eating out in London is exorbitant, any meal for free was more than welcome. Our only complaint was with the restaurant staff, they were uniformly unhelpful and slow. We would stay at the Rembrandt again."
129,1264,"Feb 20 2007	Exceeded expectations - June 16-18 2006	I had a wonderful stay at the Rembrandt Hotel on June 16-18. The two-night stay at the hotel was free with airfare on British Airways and so I didnt expect much, but was really pleasantly surprised. The hotel is located across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum in the stylish South Kensington/Knightsbridge area close to Harrods. It is convenient to two Tube stations  South Kensington and Knightsbridge. I only used the South Kensington station. For those arriving from Heathrow, the Piccadily line travels from Heathrow to the South Kensington station. Unfortunately, to exit the station, one must go up a flight of stairs to get to street level. There are very few Tube stations which are truly accessible, so as with the rest of Europe, its probably a good idea to pack light. The exits from the South Kensington station are a bit confusing as the streets around the station are not in a grid pattern. To get to the Underground exit closest to the hotel, go past the turnstiles and then head to the sign Subway to Museums. This subway (underpass) has limited hours  roughly open when the museums are open. The first exit from the subway is Brompton Rd. and this is the exit that is just a few steps away from the hotel. Other attractions close to the hotel include the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. I had emailed the hotel in advance, informing them that I was staying on my honeymoon and asked for a newer executive room. Upon check-in, I was told that the room was pre-paid and that I had been upgraded to a newer executive room. Breakfast was daily in the restaurant until 9:30am, except on Sundays when it was extended to 10:00am. One could use the Aquilla spa facilities next door to the hotel but there would be an additional charge. At one end of the check-in counter, there were apples every morning, which was great to take away as a nutritious snack. The concierge was helpful in providing me with a good map.Room 363 was in the newer wing and looked extremely new. It was facing the back street and was quiet with the windows closed. It was tiny, though, with a small double bed and just enough room to walk around it. When the bathroom door was open, there was practically no way to move around. The bathroom itself had Gilchrest and Soames conditioning shampoo and bath gel. There was only one bar of soap for the bathroom. There was one face cloth, two fluffy bath towels and two hand towels. There was a nice towel warmer which was activated by turning on the taps that resultedin hot water running through the rack. The countertops and flooring were made of granite. The tub was a Jacuzzi tub with strong jets. Inside the room, the television was the standard small European size. It had very limited channels and about four pay-per-view channels. It did have guest services features (such as checking ones bill) but the checkout feature was not working when I tried it. The television also had a convenient digital clock, and served also as an alarm. In the closet was an electronic safe, small ironing board, and iron. The desk, which had a small mirror, had the hairdryer (with excellent power) in the top drawer. Underneath the television were a mini-fridge (empty, with instructions to call the front desk to have it stocked if required) and an electric tea kettle with teabags and instant coffee. All drawers and cupboards were clearly marked with labels. The air conditioning worked extremely well. There was no ice machine as far as I could tell, although there was a tiny ice cube tray in the mini-fridge.There was a letter on the desk from the hotel management indicating that the hotel was undergoing some renovations and to expect some noise from 8:00am  6:00pm. The renovations include adding air conditioning to all rooms, changing CRT televisions to plasma televisions and adding video-on-demand, and adding wireless Internet to all areas of the hotel. These changes will undoubtedly make the hotel all that much better! Speaking of Internet, as the back of the hotel faces residential dwellings, I was able to find an unsecured Linksys and Belkin network with adequate signal to use the Internet from the room. WiFi access is currently available in the hotel lobby, but at a charge.The breakfast buffet can be either Continental or American. Continental (cold) items included hard-boiled eggs, two varieties of cold cuts, yogurt (fruit or plain), fresh fruits (whole apples, plums, oranges or sliced up oranges or grapefruits), some canned and dried fruits, cereals, pastries (croissants, mini-muffins, danishes, turnovers), toasted breads, and juices (apple, orange, or grapefruit). Hot items for the American breakfast included scrambled eggs, fried eggs, sausages, back bacon, beans, sauted mushrooms, broiled tomatoes, and an odd deep-fried toast. The manager asked for our room number at the entrance and he crossed out our room number of a printed list in his hand each morning. There were about eight rooms with Continental breakfasts and about two pages of rooms with American breakfasts. In all honesty, there is no clear demarcation of what is considered Continental and what is considered American as all the items are more or less mixed together on the buffet line. As other reviewers have posted, the employees didnt explain what items were included in your breakfast and simply said to help yourself to the buffet. Check-out was smooth and there were no surprise charges. In summary, I really enjoyed my stay at the Rembrandt Hotel and would not hesitate to recommend this London hotel to others wishing to stay in the Kensington area."

Opposite the V&amp;A museum. 10 minutes walk to Harrods and the Royal Albert Hall. Plenty of buses.Lovely room. On the top floor at the rear of the hotel. Nice and quiet and full sun all day. Excellent air con and heating. Room was of a good size and the amenities and draperies were excellent. Some noise from late night revllers, but that's not unusual in any hotel.Staff.Didn't see much of them - as it should be. When we did see them they were courteopus, attentive and polite.Eating.Only had the breakfasts. These were excellent - a very large choice suitable for most tastes. The sausuages wer excellent.Recommendation.We only stayed 2 nights and wished we had stayed longer. Will definitely go back as it was excellent value for money in a quality hotel."
131,1264,"Feb 1 2007	Loved the hotel!	We stayed at the Rembrandt for 2 nights in Dec 06. Loved the hotel! Location. The location cannot be beat. It is located right across from the Victoria-Alberts museum. The London tour bus stop is in a short walking distance. Harrods is a few blocks away. Next door to the hotel, there is an awesome sports club/spa that gives the hotel guests a discount. In a walking distance, there is a cool area with Creperie, japanese restaurant, chinese restaurant and a tea room. Rooms. Room was very large (for London standards) and well appointed (beatiful drapes and wallpaper, comfortable bed). Our room was facing the quiet back side of the building. Service.Service was great from bellman services to a concierge who helped us a great deal. Breakfast was deliscious and plentiful. There was a little glitch with the Internet connection. The hotel's server was down and the Internet was unavailable, so we couldn't do an online check-in for our international flight. We had to go to an Internet cafe nearby to do that. Overall, staying at the Rembrant was a delight and we highly recommend this hotel."
132,1264,"Jan 24 2007 	A+ Location and Room	I stayed at the Rembrandt for 10 nights (January 12-22nd) and found my stay to be most enjoyable. The location is perfect--directly across the street from the V&amp;A and a short walk from Harrods and Harvey Nichols. The South Kensington and Knightsbridge tube stations are a short walk away and bus #14 (which will take you by Picadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and a few blocks from Trafalgar Square) stops virtually right outside the hotel. I had a double ensuite room and found the size to be perfect. Plenty of space to move around with places for my two suitcases. Great hairdryer. Lots of closet and drawer space. I think the bathroom must have been a refurbished one as the tub had all sorts of jets, which feel so good on tired and sore feet. There were two downsides to my room (#232)--it was right next to the stairwell, so I'd hear the doors slam every time someone used the stairs, and there was some sort of vent outside the window that was noisy at times. To be fair, I didn't ask them to change my room when I realized the situation as I was already comfortably ensconsced in my room. I'd stay here again but in a different room--perhaps on a higher floor as that would have solved both problems. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful whenever I had a query. The person who helped me with my luggage didn't even stay around long enough for me to give him a tip. The only part of the stay I wished had been better were the eggs. On the plus side the scrambled eggs weren't greasy, but on the downside they tasted as though they were powdered eggs. There was plenty of other food to choose from though. All in all, my favorite hotel of the 4 hotels I've stayed in when I've been to London."
133,1264,"Jan 19 2007 	No Oil Painting	This is not a good hotel, not even up to 3 star. On arrival we, a couple, were allocated a smoking room with 2 single beds although we had specified double on booking and non-smoking. The re-allocated room was below Travelodge standard and in need of upgrade with broken bed frame and depressing colour scheme.We tried the bar meal and chose the steak. The wrong order was delivered and I had to send mine back as not cooked to request. The food was awful and service poor. the breakfast was also cold.We hastily re-arranged our 2nd night in london to stay elsehwre, it was that bad."
134,1264,"Jan 17 2007	Really good value	Stayed one night whilst visiting London to see a show at the Royal Albert Hall. Could not have been more convenient (walking distance). But also very convenient for Tube (Circle Line for main-line connections, Piccadily for central areas) and for the V&amp;A and Museums; all a couple of minutes walk. And not forgetting Harrods of course, also walking distance.We found the staff to be extremely pleasant and helpful, and the room was very smart, refurbished and with a first-rate bathroom including jetted tub, and very comfortable bed.The rate we paid via Otel.com was 115 which included breakfast; for London this is very good value, and the breakfast quality was excellent.They were advertising a 'special' evening buffet at a discounted rate before 6.30pm (25% off) which was good value. On arrival at the restaurant we discovered that the buffet was not operating that evening. Not happy with that - but the meal they did provide was still good, and at the same price as the buffet - and also discounted before 6.30!Only complaint was the room was very warm, and the aircon system did not really want to cool it down, even on lowest cool setting.But overall, a very good hotel - we will definitely use again when visiting London."
135,1264,"Jan 4 2007	As convenient as you would want in London	We stayed at the Rembrandt in 2004 for a week. The room was clean, serviced thoroughly, comfortable and had nice views. Staff were friendly and breakfast was superb. The real plus with this hotel is location. Close to Harrods, V&amp;A and museums and round the corner from a number of reswtaurants and the tube.We enjoyed our stay and will go back again."
136,1264,"Jan 3 2007 	Unhelpful Staff	I stayed in the Rembrandt with my partner for 5 nights in December and was extremely disappointed with the attitude of the hotel staff. We arrived in the hotel at 12 midday and were told our room was not ready. We were asked to come back between 12.30 - 1pm. When we returned at 1pm our room was STILL not ready. The staff made no apologies nor did they offer us an alternative room to change in. This was fairly inconvenient for us as we were attending an event in North London which started at 3pm and we would have liked to check in our bags &amp; freshen up before we left. When we arrived back at the hotel at 7pm that evening we eventually got to check in to what was the smallest hotel room i have ever seen. It was literally smaller than a regular house bedroom. There was a small double bed pushed against the wall at one side so my partner &amp; I had to get in &amp; out of the same side of the bed. The bed was also right next to the door so we could reluctantly hear everyones comings &amp; goings. Our room was directly across the hall from the inventory room where the cleaning equipment &amp; vaccum cleaners were kept so we were woken up at the crack of dawn every morning by the extremely loud maids. Maybe it was just bad luck that we happened to be placed in the worst room in the hotel, but seriously, they need to stop placing two people in what is very obviously a single room. Anyway we tried not to let it bother us too much and had a lovely stay in London. Good points about the hotel are its location, down the street from Harrods &amp; some other great stores, a short walk from South Kensington tube station, the buffet breakfast is quite good and the bar area is very comfortable. The next time i travel to London i will not book the Rembrandt. Its a nice enough hotel but the staff really need some customer service training and also need to learn how to smile."
137,1264,"Dec 2 2006 	Our London Base by Helen 	My husband &amp; I stayed at the Rembrandt for one night on Nov 29th 2006. This was our 3rd stay at this hotel. I was surprised to read reviews about unfriendly staff, as we found everyone to be very pleasant. I guess if you are nice to people, they are nice back! I have certainly seen some guests treating staff like something on the bottom of their shoe!We had a room on the 4th floor; I was hoping for an upgrade (we got one when we stayed in December 2004) but it was not to be. I'm surprised that the hotel still has smoking rooms, in light of the modern thinking &amp; bans. The only gripes I have about the room are the rather hard bed &amp; the fact that there wasn't much milk provided with the tea-making things. It was quite warm in the room, but the weather was unseasonably mild. Next time we will ask for a room away from the lifts, as we were disturbed by guests returning at unearthly hours! The room &amp; bathroom were spotlessly clean. We didn't use the lounge or bar, but I'm sure they would be well - kept. Full English breakfast was very good. Being picky, I would have preferred fresh mushrooms to tinned. Contrary to another review, I thought the fried eggs were spot on! There was also fried bread, which often gets missed out. The tea was very weak, but that was the first time we've had a problem. We didn't eat at any other time during our stay, but have previously had sandwiches in the lounge &amp; were very impressed, both with the presentation &amp; price. The evening meal in 2004 was good quality but very ordinary; that could be different now, of course.Everyone says this, but the Rembrandt's location is pretty hard to beat! I also think it's pretty good value for money - we paid 135 for the room. We are already planning our next trip to London for Spring 2007 &amp; will definitely return to this hotel."
138,1264,"Dec 1 2006 	Eureka!	I travel to London once or twice a year and am always looking for just the right hotel: well-located for my interests and pleasantly comfortable without being overly expensive. I've finally found it! The Rembrandt is very close to the South Kensington Tube, in an area of nice shops and restaurants, and just across the street from one of my favorite museums--the Victoria and Albert. The staff was very courteous, the public areas are quite nice, and the dining room and breakfast rate an excellent. The size of the room--by London standards--was adequate, and the wonderfully comfortable bed was made up with quality linens. Although the hotel is on a busy street, the double paned windows made it perfectly quiet. All that keeps the Rembrandt from earning an &quot;excellent&quot; rating is that the room's furnishings were a little tired; but the hotel was undergoing renovation, and I expect that negative will be remedied when I stay there again. I've recommended this hotel to an acquaintance--something I'm hesitant to do--and she agreed with my assessment."
139,1264,"Nov 25 2006 	Mixed bag...but I would stay here again	This is just one of those places where there in nothing specifically deficient, but you can't help but think, if the front desk just went the extra mile, or if they fixed up the lobby, etc., it could be so much nicer. Check in was a nightmare even though we had booked months in advance. It is always dissappointing when you have to insist on a hotel providing you with the level of room that you booked and paid for. Eventually we nearly got we had booked and requested, but frankly, we were worn down after being directed to yet a third room. Maybe that was the strategy. During the whole stay we found the front desk staff completely indefferent. Lack of eye contact, and generally made us feel uncomfortable in requesting anything, especially after the check in fiasco. This is really meant to be constructive criticism.Having said that, Yes I would still stay there again and think all in all it is still a great value. The room we ended up in was very nice though it had a dismal view. I also saw a refurbished room during our involuntary tour of the hotel and it was very nice as well.The location was great for transportation and attractions. Easy tube access and walking to shopping, tourist sites and restaurants. The hotel has a spa/gym attached to it which may or may not be inculded in your room rate depending the package that you choose. If you are a workout junkie, there should be enough to keep you occupied even if it is not what you are used to at home. Nice pool and spa as well.The dining area is beautiful and the buffet breakfast more than adequate. The lobby and hallways could use some updating but then again i didnt hang out in the lobby. I could not get a strong enough signal for the wireless internet in my room, even if i was willing to pay for it. They have 2 terminals for internet access in the lobby but they should post time limits as there were several people who I observed litrerally spending hours monopolizing those 2 computers even though other people were clearly waiting for them.So, if you feel the price is right, I would not feel worried about booking here. The location is great. Unfortunately, for not a whole lot of effort, the hotel could really make this an even better experience."
140,1264,"Nov 24 2006 	Perfectly fine...	I just got back from London, and The Rembrandt was a great choice for a five-day stay for both business and pleasure. Location was perfect -- right across the street from the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and only five minutes walk from the South Kensington tube station. I asked for a quiet room and early check-in and got both. In fact, the room was one of the quietest I've ever had -- the only sounds were the occasional closing of other doors (and I am very, very noise-sensitive). The room overlooked a charming garden so there were no cars, motorcycles, or garbage trucks below. My friend and I shared a twin room which was small but larger than many I have had in Europe, and perfectly fine. We both had enough room for our clothes and suitcases and weren't tripping over each other. The shower was strong and the water temperature also just fine. The room was neither too hot nor too cold since we learned from housekeeping how to control the heat. My friend loved the soft featherbed, but it was too much for me and , when I asked, the maid gave me a normal sheet and blanket right away. We were pleased to find that a full English breakfast was included (unlike many other hotels we had considered) and It was a good or better than what I've had in other English and European hotels. (I thoroughly enjoyed the fried eggs, sausages, tomatoes and slices of bacon. Skip the scrambled eggs.) Also, in contrast to some of the comments I've read about the Rembrandt, the front desk staff were very helpful and courteous, albeit somewhat reserved. (You just have to understand that English is not their first language. ) A few cautionary remarks: 1) Our room (445) was perfectly fine, but I don't think it was one of the renovated rooms. The decor was quaint and old-fashioned (which is what I want in London). 2) The &quot;hair dryer&quot; was hooked into the desk in the room and the outlet in the bathroom could only handle a razor. Bring a good hair dryer and plan on using it in the room, not the bathroom. 3) There was no Internet connection in our room. When we got to the hotel, we learned that the only Internet connections are in the Executive rooms, and that if you want to connect to the Internet, you have to go to the lobby and pay for a connection either on your computer or their machines. By the way, the &quot;business center&quot; is two computers and a printer in the lobby. 4)The only other drawback was the false fire alarm at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, but I blame some thoughtless guests for triggering it, not the hotel."
141,1264,"Nov 21 2006 	decent hotel-wonderful location	Hotel was built at turn of the century for Harrods-it is about 4 blocks away. It had the Victorian charm--but needed some updating. The continental breakfast was very good. The staff was friendly and attentive. I would definitely stay there again-especially for the location. Several blocks from South Kensington Tube, across the street from VIctoria and Albert Museum, Also near Natural History museum and Kensington Palace. All in all my London experience was perfect."
142,1264,"Nov 2 2006 	Good and Bad	This is the third hotel I have stayed at in London in the past few months. This was the least favorite.Good points: We were able to get an early check-in and the front desk attendant was friendly. The Concierge was very helpful. The room was immaculate, probably the cleanest hotel room I have been in for years. The location is good.Negatives: We asked three days in a row for our refrigerator to be fixed with no luck. The hotel is so hot we had to have the a/c on constantly. It was incredibly noisy and very ineffectual. The breakfast was awful. The first day the eggs were so hard that they could not be pierced with a fork. All remaining days, the eggs were raw on top. The sausage had some sort of mystery substance in it, the fruit was nasty etc. etc. In five days we were offered coffee only once. We had a room with a 'garden view'. Anyone who has been in one of these rooms can attest that the 'garden' is like something out of a Monty Python skit. We howled."
143,1264,"Oct 31 2006 	Really Good value/choice location	Located halfway between the South Kensington and Knightsbridge tube stop, and a short walk to Harrods, can't imagine a better location. Despite being on busy Brompton Road, room was always quiet for sleeping. Very spacious room by American standards, and umongous by European standards, we had a top floor room, away from elevators (our request, nicely granted) for what appears to be affordable London rates. Bed appeared to be actually larger then a traditional king, and pillows were plentiful and very comfortable. Bathtub very narrow; would not have even attempted a bath, and shower curtain was affixed to body during showers (Yuck!), but a very comfortable room, all in all. Value enhanced even further when wife informed me that breakfast buffet (hot, extensive, with really top quality bangers) was included in price. At least I hope so, cause I certainly didn't pay. As good as the breakfast was, I would steer clear of the evening carvery buffet. Mundane roast beef, not prime rib,and equally mundane sides, even if you qualify for the early bird discount price. For a great value pasta meal, and great ambiance, check out Frankies, a few blocks east of the hotel.Only real negative was the KGB attitude of the front desk. Although focused on ruthless efficiency, they all exhibited the warmth, friendliness, and helpfulness of a Siberian gulag. We met many Eastern European servers in area restaurants who were fluent in cordiality, so I refuse to allow this as an excuse. The 4.95 pounds per hour charge to use the internet is a rip off, and you can probably sneak your use on the computers with leftover minutes from previous users. British staff in the dining room appropriately charming and pleasant.Would definitely stay here again without blinking, if similar rates were available."
144,1264,"Oct 23 2006 	The Rembrandt was great	The Rembrandt was great. It was immaculate. The breakfast was sumptous. The staff was very helpful. The location is so convenient, right on the Picadilly line. It's a 50 minute trip to Heathrow. We had a very short stay - only two nights, so the convenience was very important to us. I would definitely stay again. Cathy"
145,1264,"Oct 17 2006	Average Hotel...	Probably when you are on a business trip you become more demanding, but this hotel is just avrage. The Rooms are big, but noisy and cold, at least mine one. The bathroom is small and not fancy at all, the breakfast is not what you're looking for in a 4 stars hotel in knitsbridge.I'll not come back, or at least not during my business trip!"
146,1264,"Oct 15 2006 	WONDERFUL hotel	Hi...This is the third time I've stayed at The Rembrandt and reading a few of the reviews below I just don't get it...this hotel is tremendous...if you had a bad stay here, it's probably your fault...reviewers below complained that they had stayed in 'friendlier' hotels...then why didn't you stay in them this time? You probably got a cheap package deal from British Air...The staff at The Rembrandt, as seen in a bunch of other reviews, is teriffic...yes, they're renovating, but you know what? ASK QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU BOOK. A bunch of earlier reviews talked of renovation, so having read them, why didn't you call and ask where the renovation would be and request a room elsewhere? They'll accomodate you, same as they did us, and same as they did you when you brought it ti thier attention.And this is Europe, so if you get a cheap package deal for a standard room it's not going to be like the US. Air Conditioning is not a standard feature in almost all of Europe. ASK FIRST.And if you're cleaning bill was high, that's your fault. The prices are right there...it cost over $100, which means 50L...the Hilton in Houston charged $22 for a pair of jeans and $18 for a shirt, right on par with most hotels, and we didn't use them either...Call and ask...do some legwork. This hotel does not deserve bad reviews by high maintenance, spoiled vacationers. What right do I have to say this? We stayed on our honeymoon, and I knew the hotel was under renovation. But I called, and asked to be placed away from the renovation work, and they, in a VERY friendly manner, accomdated us. And we spent the extra $50 a night and got a superior room and the view of the V&amp;A was spectacular.I cannot thank the hotel and staff for how good they were to us during our stay. We were delayed, got in 3 hours late, the GSM phone I rented didn't work and I was pretty wound up when I got there...no problem...our room was ready, perfect, and a nice card from the staff congratulating us...at 11 at night they had suggestions on where to grab a good bite...Pizza and a live band in a basement on Brompton Road...the food was great, the band was lousy but we had fun with all the people there...and it cost $100!!!!! Because the pound is so strong...you have to know you can't stay in London as an American and not go broke...but so what, skimp when you get back...have some fun...And The Rembrandt is fun, and the people are friendly, and if your rooms not ready at 7 in the morning, well, how many hotels have rooms that are??? Mostly one's held for big corporate clients...I know they have a baggage room and then you can explore till 2...ok, enough preaching...the honest review...This is a good hotel, in a great spot, at a teriffic price, with a friendly and attentive staff...for this price, in this neighborhood, there is no better...stay in Bayswater next time for the same price and see what you get...and then wander around that neighborhood at two in the morning after the bell rings...I will stay in The Rembrandt every time. But I will call and ask questions and be certain we all know what I'm looking for. Lastly...thanks to all the staff who signed the lovely card in our room, it was a great way to begin our European honeymoon. And the Bunch of Grapes is still great too...Thanks again for everything, we'll see you next time...travellors...stay at this lovely hotel, but ask questions FIRST!!!!!!!!"
147,1264,"Oct 13 2006	Unfriendly staff and worst service in London	I had stayed at the Rembrandt some years ago and though I didn't find the hotel superb, I found it nice and with a good location. That's why I decided to book it again in my recent trip to London. I had booked a standard double room for 130 GBP with breakfast.When I arrived at the hotel I was told there was no smoking room available in rude and unfriendly manners by the girl at the front desk whose name was Juliane. I told here I had booked a smoking room but she returned I had requsted one, it didn't mean I would get one. After much conversation and no help from her to attend my request I told her I would pay for an executive room if she had one. There was one available which would be more 40 GPB, that is 170 GBP. I accepted to pay it convinced I would get a great room.In the meantime no one came to collect my luggage, 2 large suitcases, so me and my daughter took them to the room.The executive room was tiny, dated and was no different from the standard room I had stayed some years before. I was also told we had wireless conection but the internet wasn't wireless, we had to ask the concierge for a cable and leave a deposit of 10GBP for it! Anyway we weren't able to get conection and no one made any effort to help us! Every time I went to the concierge or the front desk I was treated with ice cold unfriendly manners, as if they were doing me a favour.The buffet breakfast was dull, the choices weren't plenty and the quality was bad, the croissants were dry, they seemed to have a few days already. The only good thing about the hotel was its location but I will never stay in this place again nor do I recommend it to anyone. It's expensive, dated and unfriendly with the worst service you can get in London. Stay away from here!"
148,1264,"Oct 2 2006 	Good Location	The best thing about the Rembrandt was the location. Just around the corner from the South Kensington tube station and a few blocks from Harrod's. Several good cafes are nearby too...we especially liked the Creperie where main dish and dessert crepes are to die for! Good shopping nearby too on Brompton Road.The room was small and, as others have noted, the hotel is under renovation. We heard banging &amp; other noises from our room on the fifth floor but always after a decent time in the morning. The weather was warmer than the 60 degrees we expected and was more like 80 degrees and our room was not air-conditioned. Open windows to traffic and a fan going made sleeping a challenge...not to mention showering in the heat. The room was clean and the bath was too.The breakfast buffet was fine;plenty of choices and good. We did not eat lunch or dinner there opting for the local cafes.Would we stay there again? Doubtful...but the location may bring us back.Staff was not super friendly...we arrived at 7am but absolutely could not check-in until 2pm even with several requests made.Staff got us a car to Heathrow and told us it would be 30GBP...but the driver charged us 50GBP at the airport. Beware.We've stayed at hotels in London that were far more friendly than the Rembrandt. If location and price are important then this hotel is fine."
149,1264,"Sep 28 2006 	Very Comfortable	Trip Advisor review led us to The Rembrandt as we wanted to be in the Knightsbridge-Kensington area. We upgraded to a superior room @ 96GBP and were very pleased with that decision.The room was very ample as was the bath. It was clean and in good condition. We faced the V&amp;A and the very busy Brompton Rd. Despite the traffic, the room noise was non-existent.Best feature? THE BED. It was huge and piled with 6 pillows of varying firmness. Heavenly!Worse feature? One of those light-weight cloth shower curtains that attacks you. Aaaahhh!The hotel is under renovation in the lobby and bar areas but the disruptions were handled well and not a problem. It's likely completed by now. The buffet breakfast (included) was typical English and ample, however not particularly distinguished.Buffet lunch was average at best.Harrod's up the street, V&amp;A across the street, S Kensington tube station about 50 yds away. Very convenient location with some good pubs nearby. Victoria Station was about a 10 min cab ride."
150,1264,"Sep 27 2006 	The Rembrandt; A Roll Of The Dice Really	If you are like me, you have spent a ridiculous amount of hours poring over hotel reviews in an effort to pick the right hotel to ensure that your inevitabaly expensive stay in London will be a pleasant one. I would love to give The Rembrandt a completely glowing review, but my experience would seem to indicate that it's not necessarily which hotel you stay in, but which room you are assigned in any given hotel. When I first got to my fifth floor room of the Rembrandt, I would say that my feeling was of resigned, but mild disappointment. The room was badly dated, a bit tattered, smelled weird, and had unsightly stains on the ceiling. I was ok with it though, because despite all that, the bathroom and the sheets seemed reasonably clean and the hotel is in a good location. Then, on my first morning there, I was woken up at about 7:00 am by loud, jocular conversation in the room next to mine. I figured that this was just a couple of guys packing up to leave, but then there were more voices, and louder talking. At about 8:00 am, someone started a circular saw that sounded like it was literally inches from my head. A few moments later there was hammering so loud that it really sounded as though they were coming through the wall. This was obviously intolerable. I sometimes like to stay out a bit late when I am on vacation and I occasionally like to have the luxury of sleeping until 10:00. When I complained at the front desk, the staff couldn't have been any more accommodating. They offered a genuine apology, and upgraded me to a Superior room. This room was fresh, clean, quiet and comfortable.Although I must say that if I had been paying the Superior price I may have been a bit disappointed. They describe these rooms as &quot;garden view&quot;, but they really look out on the back of the hotel. So if you are considering a stay at this hotel in the near future, I would recommend that you insist on a room that has already been rennovated, which probably means a room on one of the lower floors. If you have a decent room, this hotel is a pretty good value: good location , professional staff, nice breakfast buffet, and reasonably priced by London standards. You should be aware that the hotel attracts an older crowd. I am forty, and seemed to be one of the younger guests. Also, unless you are independently wealthy, do not use the hotel dry cleaning service- 2 pairs of jeans, four dress shirts and a pair of socks were over $100.00 !!!!!!!- a somewhat unpleasant surprise on my departure."
151,1264,"Sep 15 2006	great hotel	Based on the reviews from others, we booked our room at the The Rembrandt between Sep 2 to 5 for 3 nights. we booked through shortbreak direct (based in England i believe). 99 pounds per night. it was a great deal. we got upgraded to the executive room. bathroom was huge compared to London Bridge hotel where we also stayed later in our trip. Great location. less than 5 minutes walk from South Kingsington Station. We took the Tube from the airport and no problem at all. (we were a little confused on which exit to get out in the subway) When we checked in, we were also told that we have been upgraded to full English breakfast. we ate very well each morning. the room size was adequate (we had a double) and very comfortable. the staff were very courteous. we had some problem with the room safe but they were able to fix it right away. i highly recommend it. The supermarket Marks and Spencer is about 5 minutes walk east of the hotel. there is a mini fridge in our room and is not stocked with mini bar stuff which was great to store our water and fruit,etc.We took the Tube everywhere. got the day pass and went to Covent Garden every night. the only thing is that the Tube station close at 10 pm. so we had to take a taxi one night that costed about 12 pounds.highly recommend it. if we go back to London, we would stay there again."
152,1264,"Aug 7 2006	safe and comfortable	Have stayed there twice and my college age sons also twice by themselves. Safe for solo women travelers; staff very helpful; rooms comfortable but if you want a city view, request it. Food and bar good.Excellent location; easy to get to from Heathrow; a bit of a trek to Covent Garden but tube is easily accessible."
153,1264,"Aug 5 2006	A Great Hotel	We stayed at the Rembrandt in early July for two nights as part of a promotion put on by British Airways. We had a fully airconditioned, large, and nicely decorated room for two nights. The breakfasts were excellent and included in our rate. The location is wonderful and you can easily get to any major attraction with a quick ride on the tube. I would stay here again!"
154,1264,"Aug 3 2006	Very nice hotel	Our travel agent chose this hotel for us, and we were not disappointed. We went in the middle of summer and so we had to upgrade to an air-conditioned room, but the whole hotel will have this upgrade in the future. The room was very nice, clean, and modern. The bathroom was spectacular with a whirlpool tub. The location was great- 2 short blocks to the South Kensington tube stop. We would definitely return to this hotel."
155,1264,"Jul 23 2006	Our favorite hotel	This was our fourth time staying at the Rembrandt., We love the location, across from the Victoria and Albert museum, a short walk to Harrods, the tube station is a short walk around the corner, and lots of restaurants and shopping in the area. The staff are always very freindly and helpful. We stayed in an executive king room on the 5th floor. The executive rooms have a/c which was needed during the recent heat wave. A lot of the rooms are under renovation at this time, but that was not a problem on our floor. The room had tv, small fridge which we had requested, and a safe in the closet. Our room included the full english breakfast which is served buffet style, Very plentiful and good. We enjoyed a drink in the evening in the lounge area where they have a big screen, and we watched Wimbleton and highlights of the World Cup Soccer games. It is still our favorite home away from home when we visit London! Just a hint: if you don't like your room, just tell them, they will be happy to show you others."
156,1264,"Jul 19 2006	Good Room/Bad Food	Last minute booking with shortbreaksdirect, first choice not available, Rembrandt was offered via telephone call. Email confirmation backed up by postal confirmation. It was here we notice that we had a room upgrade. Rather sceptical at 99 per night for 2 with breakfast in Knightsbridge over the road from the V&amp;A. Arrived in a heat wave, the hotel was cool, reception was efficient and the room was an upgrade. At the back with nice views over some splendid Georgian houses, very very quiet. Fanstastic air con, very comfortable bed, splendid bathroom with jacuzzi bath, very clean and fairly spacious.Although the restaurant was a nice place to be (and totally non smoking as was the room) the food was really terrible. We had the Sunday night (and every night I think) carvery which was either a really dried out Turkey or Beef. Hardly any vegatables and the Yorkshire pudding was like, well! All the food was tepid apart from the hot satly gravy.Breakfast was passable, had worse but also had much much better. Rubber eggs and hard bacon terrible tea and awful coffee. Having said, would return again and again, for the hotel and the location, plenty of good cafes nearby, Harrods (foodhall!) 5 mins away, South Ken station 5 mins away and museums on the doorstep. A very nice historic hotel."
157,1264,"Jul 7 2006	You should stay at this hotel	We stayed at The Rembrandt Hotel in the Knightsbridge section of London 5/21 - 5/28/2006. We reserved an Executive Room at 170 British pounds which is around $300 USD. The room faced the back of the hotel which is the back of flats with no balconies so there was no street noise, no noise at all. The room was very large and the bathroom was huge. It was extremely clean, coffee/tea maker. The room rate included a Full English Breakfast which is not all that tasty but you can get orange juice, croissants and rice crispies to fill your stomach! This hotel is 1 1/2 blocks from the South Kensington tube and about 3 blocks from Harrods and the Knightsbridge tube, it is directly across from the Victoria &amp; Albert museum. Many restaurants and &quot;7-11&quot; or convenience stores nearby for you to get snacks, liquor, newspapers, etc. I made our reservation on the internet and all was as agreed upon when we arrived. There are no ice machines for us Americans but room service delivered at no charge. The room rate also included the 17.5% Value Added Tax and some hotels added this on as an extra charge. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. You won't go wrong in this neighborhood."
158,1264,"Jun 27 2006	Another Rembrandt fan	Came as a freebie with a British Air flight special so we were a little suspicious. To our surprise, the hotel was charming. our room was a good size, with a nice sitting area. we enjoyed the lounge and bar and breakfast was impressive. best of all, the location was spectacular. we were stopping in London for only two days, to visit friends, and continuing on to France and we spent one of our precious days simply crossing the street and enjoying the fabulous V &amp; A museum. While you can't beat &quot;free&quot; we'd actually pay to stay here."
159,1264,"Jun 27 2006	Loved the Rembrandt	My daughter and I stayed at the Rembrandt for six nights and loved it. We had the king executive room with air conditioning and it was great. We were right by the elevators and there was never any noise at all. Room service was great food and great service. The conceirge was wonderful, the gave directions, helped with taxis and helped with all my tour needs. The location was wonderul, a short walk to Harrods and across the street from the Victoria and Albert museum. We would stay there over and over again.Travelers from Houston, Texas"
160,1264,"Jun 13 2006	Would highly recommend	As first time travelers to London, we were extremely pleased with the Rembrandt Hotel and give it an enthusiastic &quot;thumbs up&quot;. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and spacious (however, regulating the room temperature was very tricky), and the location was convenient and in a FABULOUS part of town. We'll definitely return."
161,1264,"Jun 5 2006	Good hotel with charm	I stayed with my wife and 9 year old son a week here and were satisfyed. Very good location, large room for London. Our room on upper floor had old fashioned window, which we could open to get fresh air and nice view."
162,1264,"Jun 5 2006	Fantastic Location	If you're looking for a decent hotel with access to museums and shopping, the Rembrandt Hotel is perfect! I just got back from staying there for 6 days and had a great time. The standard double room is spacious and a view of the V&amp;A museum right across the street. The superior double room is a bit bigger, and has more posh decorations. more comfortable chairs, bigger closet and desk.The breakfast is a generous buffet with either an English breakfast or continental options. (Get there before 10am, it gets a bit hectic) The concierge and staff were helpful, but don't expect them to help much in terms of the Internet access. Internet Access is only available in the Lounge/Lobby area. You really want to use the wireless internet from the Lounge near the bar. Much better signal. If you login from near the front lobby, the signal will drop and your session cannot be used for 3 hours. We ended up having to purchase two 24-hour tickets because the signal dropped a couple times. My biggest gripe is that the internet access is not available in each room and isn't Free. I thought that was the standard nowadays.Besides my picky-ness on the internet access, the Rembrandt was a great hotel to stay in and has some great restaurants near the South Kensington tube station."
163,1264,"Jun 4 2006	a very nice stay at the Rembrandt	My husband, college-aged daughter &amp; I stayed at the Rembrandt for two nights in March 2006. The staff was friendly and very helpful and helped book several tours as well as line up transportation for us. The bathroom was very spacious and the double bed was comfortable. There were no rooms available for 3 so they brought in a sofa bed which was not all that comfortable. We enjoyed the wonderful breakfast buffet in their lovely dining room."
164,1264,"May 30 2006	Terrific Location!	We stayed at the Rembrandt for two days at the end of May. Travelled with my husband, two children (ages 5 and7) and my mother-in-law. Due to a BA promotion offering two free nights at the hotel when flights booked with them, we decided to splurge and upgrade our free &quot;standard&quot; rooms to &quot;executive&quot; rooms (after hearing that the hotel is located on a main road and that standard rooms do not come with air-conditioning). That was a very good move since the weather was quite humid and we were able to sleep comfortably without traffic noise.Our rooms were on the 4th floor, nicely appointed, with a king size bed and a small sitting room which converted a sofa to a bed for the boys. Grandma was next door. The view wasn't all that nice : roof air conditoining compressors etc, and the back of other buildings. But for 40 pounds upgrade per night, one can't really complain.Breakfast was nice enough. Cold continental breakfast (meats, cheeses, yoghurt, granola, cereals, coffe and tea) or a hot breakfast for an additoinal 5 or 6 pounds offering bacon, eggs, fried toast, mushrooms, baked beans (God help us all at that hour . . .) and the like. With both of my children having severe food allergies, I was pleasantly surprised that the breakfast staff were really very helpful - some even went to find the original boxes that items came in so I could read the ingredient labels.The Hotel is conveniently located about 3 or 4 blocks from Harrods, a 5 minute walk from South Kensignton tube station, across from the V&amp;A Musuem, and down the street from the Natural Hsitory Musuem. BEST OF ALL: they are conveniently located on the BIG BUS COMPANY route. With a ticket that is valid for 24 hours (buses run from about 9:00 and the last stop ends at 8:00 p.m.) we were able to see all of London on the double decker tour the first afternoon. Then the following morning we used the bus route to plan where we would get off and back on to go inside and explore some the sights. The price of the bus ticket included a lovely River Thames cruise that we took from the Tower of London and dropped us back at the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, and the London Eye. We then got back on the bus and took it to Buckingham Palace and then back to the Hotel. We could never have seen as much as we did had we not taken the bus (I was born and bred in London and saw more in 2 days with my family than I had ever seen in the 20 years I lived there).I spoke with Concierge and they were able to arrange for a mini van to pick us all up from the airport for about 65 pounds (we would have needed 2 black taxis and it would have been far more than that) and again arranged for another car service to take us all to another destination after that. The concierge staff was friendly and knowledgable. We also bought the Big Bus Company tickets from the Concierge desk.However, if you plan to visit more than 1 or two of the paying sights (lots of the musuems are free) then look into the &quot;London Pass&quot; which for a flat fee will get you into many of the sights and will be cheaper than shelling money out at each of the places (there's express entry with it too)Overall, I would go back. The hotel was certainly comfortable and clean and the staff went out of their way to accommodate and assist my family during our stay."
165,1264,"May 30 2006	Superb location comfortable room!	Like many others, we booked the Rembrandt as part of a British Airways promotion but extended our stay by one extra night to emcompass our anniversary. The hotel thoughtfully had a bottle of red wine and two glasses in our executive room upon arrival. The room itself was on the top floor, in the back of the hotel with a stellar view of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the adjacent private green space. It was quiet, had windows that opened out and was generally roomy and comfortable.The hotel also featured wonderful common rooms. The lobby and adjacent sitting area as well as the breakfast room were all open and welcoming. Thurloe is great street adjacent to much of South Ken's best features and a quick walk into the parks. The nearby Oratory restaurant is one to check out.The staff at the Rembrandt were very helpful during our stay, the breakfast was a nice bonus in the morning. All in all, we had a splendid stay and would recommend this hotel for it's tidy rooms and wonderful London location."
166,1264,"May 20 2006	Excellent value for money opposite the V 	We chose the Rembrandt on the recommendation of a British Air clerk which airline had it on special. If you are fans of the V &amp; A, directly across the street, you cannot be better located. It's convenient to the Knightsbridge tube stop and a quick taxi ride from the theater district [outside of rush hour.] Harrods is a few blocks away but we found it much reduced in quality.The hotel is large but well run; it does not have an institutional feel. The staff was especially helpful. We were able to discuss room alternatives with a desk clerk who took us on a tour of rooms available. We requested and were given a room in the rear away from the very busy street. Our first choice was in the lower area in the process of re-decoration and had a tricky level change. We moved the next night, our second of three, further up which was quieter albeit smaller requiring some adjustments for accessing our luggage. We would have preferred fewer chairs  we werent going to entertain guests  and more floor space. Our room was clean and comfortable. A continental breakfast was included with our package but the maitre d told us to go ahead and eat what we wished. The food was tasty and ample, from cereals and fresh fruits through the customary pork products, baked beans, eggs, baked tomatoes, mushrooms, cheese Enough to last until dinner. An excellent value for money."
167,1264,"May 15 2006	Fair deal but noisy	I've spent a couple of nights in a first floor room on the back. The room was quite spacious (compared to London's standards) and fairly decorated,but the only window was facing the air conditioning compressors and kitchen's air outlet. This made quite impossible to open the window because of the noise &amp; smell. Moreover the room was really noisy all night long (air conditioning, bathrooms, doors slammed etc.)."
168,1264,"May 4 2006	Boutique Hotel feeling	My husband, 12 year old son and I stayed at the Rembrandt over Easter this year and were thrilled with the Hotel. Our executive sized triple room was large and airy, with all the amenities one would expect from a 4 star hotel, (in London, anyway). It was superbly located, friendly and felt like a little boutique hotel. The public rooms were charming and breakfast was excellent. The only gripe I have is the swimming pool advertised on their web site actually belongs to the health club next door and you have to pay a health club fee to use it."
169,1264,"May 1 2006	I would definitely stay here again	My wife and I spent eight nights here, and I can recommend the Rembrandt highly. We stayed in an executive room on the fourth floor with a king-size bed, and were pleasantly suprised by the size of the room for the price we paid (we got a special deal from the website because we stayed more than six nights). The location is perfect -- a great neighbohood for exploring, and also quite convenient to the Tube for getting around to the rest of London. We had a couple of minor glitches (the tea kettle stopped working and our key cards did not work one time), but the staff promptly fixed these minor problems. The staff was friendly and helpful (particularly the Concierage desk), and the breakfast (included in our room rate) was more than sufficient. In sum, I would recommend it highly to tourists (I cannot speak to the convenience of its location for business travelers)."
170,1264,"Apr 30 2006	Nice if you want to visit the museums and Harrods	My daughter and I stayed at The Rembrandt Hotel April 26-28 during a short stay in London. The room was free due to a British Air promotion, and included continental breakfast. I paid a grand total of 1.40 for my entire stay (cost of the morning newspapers). We had requested two twin beds in a non-smoking room. We received our choice of beds but had to make do with a smoking room - a minor inconvenience for a free stay.If you are interested in visiting a couple of museums and Harrods, then this is a good location. The hotel was located across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is next to the Natural History Museum. Harrods is just a four block walk down the street. There are loads of shops, restaurants, and small markets nearby. The South Kensington tube stop was a few minutes' walk from the hotel, and the Green Line service (to Windsor) was about a 10 minute walk.We were greeted at the door, promptly and courteously checked in, and offered help with our bags. The room was very clean, with an in-room safe and small terrace. They are refurbishing all of the rooms, and will be adding air conditioning. This is definitely to their advantage, since our room faced the very busy street and is very loud with the windows open. The room was a bit warm, but we couldn't keep the windows open for any length of time due to the street noise. The bathroom was clean, but the toilet took several attempts each time to flush it. The shower had just one very flimsy curtain, so that it clung to me during my shower. Hopefully they'll replace this with a glass partition during the refurbishment.The complimentary continental breakfast was adequate - a selection of cereals, breads, fruit, juices, ham, cheese, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs. For an extra 5 or 6 we could've upgraded to the hot breakfast, which included about 6 or 8 different items.We enjoyed our stay the The Rembrandt, and would recommend it with one caveat - if your room has not yet been refurbished, you will need a good pair of earplugs if you enjoy sleeping with the windows open."
171,1264,"Apr 23 2006	Fantastic Rooms Even Better Location!	Our family spent 10 days at the Rembrandt and had a wonderful experience. The hotel was recommended by a friend who takes his family there regularly. We also read the reviews on tripadvisor.com. After much thought, we booked ajoining Executive Rooms (hotel has several different types of rooms, the executive being the most expensive). These are some of the nicest hotel rooms we've stayed in. The Executive rooms and bathrooms were huge. The bathrooms had marble and granite throughout. The tubs were deep and the shower pressure strong. Everything was exceptionally clean. The rooms also have a mini-fridge which came in handy. Our rooms were recently upgraded and the hotel was in the process of doing other rooms during our stay. As we were a family travelling, we enjoyed having the two rooms ajoining. We were on the 6th floor, facing away from the street, so we heard almost no noise whatsoever. The rooms were a bit warm, but we could open the windows which adjusted the temperature just fine. I must mention the location--the Rembrandt is situated between two tube stops and within walking distance of parks, museums, and Harrods! We often would stop at Harrods on the way home just to pick up some snack at the Food Court. The South Ken. neighborhood is posh, to say the least, and we had a lot of fun just walking around the neighborhoods. We found the hotel staff very nice and helpful. Our breakfast was included and was more than adequate. The breakfast room is large, with tall windows looking out onto the beautiful S. Ken neighborhood. The buffet offered many choices for US and european travelers. Hot tea and coffee were offered immediately and we leisurely ate our breakfast every morning while planning our daily activities. We only had a few minor issues during our 10 day stay. Our check-in didn't go as smoothly as we had hoped--our original rooms were not available when we we arrived (11:30am), nor at checked in (3:00), as a guest decided to stay an extra day. So for the first night we stayed in different rooms (Superior room-- nice, but smaller than the Executive) and then we moved to our Executive rooms the next night. The hotel compensated us for this inconvenience. Also, it was important to put the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door if you wished to sleep past 8:00 am, as the maids were anxious to clean rooms as soon as possible (maids were very sweet &amp; nice). We did not rely upon hotel staff for travel information, reservations, etc. so we cannot report on their abilities in these areas. We can't wait to go back &amp; stay in our same rooms. Really beautiful, comfortable, huge, lots of storage, etc."
172,1264,"Apr 11 2006	Not what it used to be	My family and I stayed at the Rembrandt hotel many times in the late 1980's and early 90's and were delighted with the hotel at the time. We expected to experience the same good service and lovely rooms that we had once experienced when we visited in December 2005.It was however one problem after another from the moment we arrived. We experienced several problems checking in, mostly due to a lack of knowledge of the hotel rooms by the desk staff as well an inability to understand and communicate efficiently in English. We were shown into a room that was already occupied, had to switch rooms due to construction that the front desk was unaware of and then were given a master key to the hotel (we found out when we accidentally opened the wrong room). We also did not receive phone messages for several days and were given incorrect information by the concierge. We were also treated rudely by a maid who was annoyed that she could not make up our room at 9:00am. We received a response to our complaints after our visit by the head of Sarova hotels which contained many careless spelling mistakes and only offered us a VERY slight upgrade for a future stay. Very disappointing and indicative of the sloppy manner in which this hotel is managed! The only plus is the great location."
173,1264,"Mar 22 2006	Wonderful Experience	We just returned from a family Spring Break Vacation in London. We found the Rembrandt and the staff highly accommodating. The hotel is in a great location, not only centralized but safe. You are in walking distance to Harrods (very important to teenage shoppers)as well as across the street from 2 museums that are free! I was concerned about having a connecting, non-smoking room, because of our children. Even though I booked this through British Airways, I called the hotel myself to be sure we could work this out. (Which I suggest for anyone to do if you have questions, do not rely totally on British Airways). The rooms were clean and neat and had everything we needed. I found the Concierge service to be quite helpful. We had an issue with a tour we booked and they are working on trying to help us get our money back. The continental breakfast was in our package and I felt it was quite adequate.The rooms have 3 locks on the door as well as a safe for money and passports. I really liked this hotel and knowing that they are renovating their rooms I can't wait to take my family back!!!!!!"
174,1264,"Mar 20 2006	Unfriendly atmosphere	The hotel itself is very impressive, however the actual rooms are not as special as I was hoping! We did actually ask to move rooms once as the first room we were put in was two single beds pushed together, had a really noisey air conditioning unit and had no bath. The second room was much better although I think the bed was broken and sloped down at the bottom as every morning we woke up half way down the bed!The Rembrandt is full of business types and I found that the atmosphere was quite unfriendly. None of the staff made an effort to get to know us and I did feel a little bit out of place. We were told we would get free access to the fitness suite but when we tried to get in were turned away and left feeling a little embarrassed. The venue of the hotel is very good right in the centre of Knightsbridge in close proximity to a lot of the famous London landmarks and in walking distance to Leicester Square.I personally wouldn't go again and didn't think that it was worth the high prices."
175,1264,"Mar 9 2006 	Mixed	Basically this hotel was OK.On the positive side the public rooms are bright and very spacious and the staff were nice, polite and tried to be helpful. The rooom was a very good size for London, clean and comfortable. Maid service was first class.Breakfast was a fairly standard affair. Room Service was a little slow but the food was excellent and cheap for the area - despite what others have said in reviews.Location is ideal, directly opposite the Victoria and Albert Museum and near the Natural History Museum. It is also 5 - 10 Mins level walk from South Kensington Tube station. The downside is that it is on the main route to/from the M4 Motorway so expect 4 lanes of commuter traffic past the hotel from around 7am each morning - noisy if you have a room at the frontSo why didnt I really like it? Well, it was the little things. The decor in the corridors on my floor looked tired (they are about to refurbish it). On the first night my room smelled of fried food as the windows were open and I was at the back of the building- I assume over the kitchens. Great view. awful smell.In booking an early morning call, there was the member of staff who could not understand the term '6.15am'....and I mean could not understand it. I had to repeat it 5 times before he understoodAbove all, perhaps it was the copy of Saga Magazine on the bedside table that made me feel it really wasn't for me!If you want a comfortable reasonably priced hotel as a good base for exploring London this one should be OK - but I doubt that it will inspire you."
176,1264,"Mar 7 2006	im lovin it lovin it lovin it!!	We stayed here for one night, booked off the hotel website which included breakfast. The breakfast was yummy! good selection of hot food, as well as cereals, fruit, muffins etc. We stayed in the executive double and the room was nice and big, bathroom was spotless with jacuzzi bath, nice huge comfy bed. The view from our room wasn't all that great but that wasn't so much of a problem. The staff were decent and very helpful when we realised that my boyfriend had left his Ipod in the room after we had checked out. All in all... a BRILLIANT hotel, cant wait to stay there again!"
177,1264,"Feb 28 2006	A wonderful stay	We (3 women) stayed here for 5 nights from Feb 15-20 and found the hotel very friendly with excellent service. When we arrived at 9am our room was not ready but they gave us another room to stay in and rest after the long flight until our room was ready. Our room was spacious and very clean. The location is great, near many different restaurants, shopping including Harrods and the tube station. There is even a Spa next door. We never had a problem with security and felt very safe at all times. The concierge got us great seats to Mary Poppins, a must-see musical. It was a very enjoyable stay."
178,1264,"Feb 17 2006	Very Nice Stay	My wife and I stayed at the Rembrant Hotel Feb 4-11, 2006. We were in London for vacation and got a very favorable rate on airfare and hotel through British Air.Because it was low season, we were given an upgrade on the room. The first couple of rooms we were shown were in need of updating. The last room (#463) was recently redone in bright colors and was quite nice. We were very happy in that room. However, there are some things to keep in mind. The room had no a/c. This was not a problem for us being wintertime but the weather during our stay was unseasonably warm. We didn't use the heater and on several occasions had to open the window at night. So, if you are there in the warmer times of year, insist on a room with a/c.The staff was overall warm and helpful. The public spaces in the hotel were attractive and accomodating. The breakfast (included with the package) was very nice. We liked the location very much. The neighborhood is upscale. The buses to &quot;town&quot; were across the street, in front of the V&amp;A (also a real plus) and the tube was 5 minutes away.We would certainly stay there again."
179,1264,Feb 13 2006 	Guest Safety and Security At Risk	Someone entered our room between 12 am and 3.30 am and stole our passport and credit cards. The hotel's response was minimal. They would not even provide us an extended check-out so that we could go to the Embassy and get things in order. There was no concern for guest welfare. There are no CCTV's within the hotel. The hotel manager declined to meet with us and didn't even give the courtesy to check-in with us. Stay AWAY!
180,1264,"Feb 7 2006	please be careful before booking this hotel	We had the fright of our lives in the middle of the night as we found our hotel room door propped open with our clothes, and my wallet, passport and credit cards were stolen while we slept.Clothing was recovered on back steps though all documents were gone.The police were called and ascertained that this was probably an inside job as there was no sign of forced entry and there was no sign that the thief entered or exited through the back entrences. Naturally the hotel management disagreed. The final insult came as we didn't receive the courtesy of a phone call from the hotel's management after to see if there was anything they could do to make us more comfortable. Unbelievably, We weren't even offered a late check-out time to arrange ourselves after our morning at the embassy.Please be carefull before booking this hotel."
181,1264,"Feb 4 2006	Good choice of hotel	For our honeymoon, we went to London for five days this January. We really were plesanantly surprised with the Rembrandt. Through the British Airways website, we were able to get 2 direction flights from Atlanta and 5 nights at the Rembrandt for $2000 - and that's with us upgrading from coach to their &quot;World Traveller Plus&quot; seats that give you more room, a foot rest, etc. We would not have been able to afford a hotel like the Rembrandt without the BA deal. The hotel was in a great location - a couple easy walking blocks to Harrod's, the Tube Stop, a Boots Pharmacy, and across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum. There are restaurants and Pubs all along the street for you to eat at also.From all that we read about London hotels, we were expecting to find a microscopic room and bathroom - we found a very nice sized room as well as a good sized bathroom. My only warning is for those of you are mobility challenged: the Rembrandts tub wall is at least 3 inches higher than normal American tubs and it may be a challenge for you to step in the tub. The heated towel bar was a nice bonus. The hotel has a free continental breakfast that is decent - cereals, toasts, muffins, croissants, or you can upgrade to the hot breakfast for 5 pounds (we tried it once - wasn't really worth it). Skip having the dinner buffet in the hotel's restaurant - it was just OK. The room was a little hot and no thermostat to turn down the heat - but it was also decently mild the days we were there. We just cracked the window a bit to let the room cool off when returning from a day of sight-seeing. Pros: great location, nice sized rooms (with hairdryers)Cons: hot room, hotel food just average, wait staff very slowHope this helps! And definitely look into package deals through Airlines - that's how we were able to save a ton of money!"
182,1264,"Dec 27 2005	Lived up to Good Reviews	I selected this hotel based on the reviews - and they were right! Best hotel I've stayed in within London. Our room was quite large (for London), with tall windows and classic curtains framing the room. There was a tea service to make tea in our room - which we loved. The bathroom was clean, modern and my 6'3'' hubby could fit in it. The included breakfast was delicious and was provided in an elegant dinning room. (Hot breakfast was extra for our package) We booked through BA and the room was part of a promotion. V&amp;A is right across the street, and the Natural Science museum next door a plus for us. I switch between budget and nicer traveling; this was a treat."
183,1264,"Dec 16 2005	fab location	stayed one night prior to taking a day trip on the orient express.Booked two days prior to visit direct with hotel ,we had a superior room with full breakfast for 114 pounds which for london is pretty good.Hotel clean,staff helpful and food plentiful.Location is fab,right opposite is the V and A museum and harrods is less than five minutes away.The whole area is suberb ,with little classy shops,pubs and restaurants.By the way,if you ever get the chance take a xmas lunch trip on the orient express ,it is the best!."
184,1264,"Nov 8 2005	Pleasant Stay	My husband and I stayed at the Rembrant on the recommendation of friends who had stayed there previously. The hotel is in a good location within walking distance to Harrods, museums and Hyde Park and the tube station is just a couple of blocks away. I felt very safe in the neighborhood. The hotel staff is very accommodating and the lobby and public areas were comfortable and welcoming. Our room was an &quot;executive room&quot; with king bed (two beds put together) and was clean and comfortable but on the small side. We had a lovely view of a home garden from our window. The bathroom was marble and large enough to manage. I found the tub slightly on the small side especially if you are a large person but the shower was great. The only complaint we had was we could never get the air conditioner to work and it got rather stuffy in the room at night even with the windows open. The breakfast was included and was plentiful and the wait staff was excellent. All in all a very pleasant experience and I would probably return."
185,1264,"Oct 20 2005	Very Average	My husband and I recently stayed in the hotel for 3 nights.First Impression - The lobby, bar and public areas are in excellent shape, but small. Staff - I cannot say enough about how wonderful the staff was. Definitely the highlight of this hotel. Restaurant - Breakfast is a buffet each morning with a very wide selection. Everything was very good. We never had lunch or dinner there. Location - We felt the neighborhood was very safe. We were within walking distance to Harrods, a few museums and many restaurants. The tube station is a 5 minute walk and the stop for the &quot;Big Bus&quot; is a 2 minute walk. However, for the sights that we wanted to see this was not the most ideal location. Rooms - Unfortunately we were very disappointed in our room. The rooms are small and dark. The furnishings and bedding are very worn. We booked the Executive Level and I am honestly not sure whether or not we actually received it as the rooms we saw looked nothing like the picture on the website. After check-in and seeing our room we did go back to the front desk to see if we had been given the right room and 3 rooms later we were still in the same type of room. The room was kept clean, but I found it disappointing compared to the rest of the hotel."
186,1264,"Oct 3 2005	Loved the Rembrandt!	We stayed here 4 times and absolutely loved the Rembrandt. I found the staff courteous even before we arrived with prompt return of emails and they answered all of my questions quickly.Our first stay was in an executive room. The room was reasonably sized with plenty of space around the beds, and a desk area and table and chairs. A mini fridge was set up for us upon request and was great to store snacks and those things that I didn't want to stop eating because I was away from home. Beds were comfortable, pillows flat but we found that everywhere and an extra one sorted that out easily. The airconditioner was well used as London was pretty hot when we arrived in early September. The bathroom was marble, great tub with jacuzzi settings (excellent after a long day out). We loved the choices at breakfast which was a buffet with cold cheeses and meats, yogurts and tin fruits, and a hot section with various egg dishes, bacon, sausages, mushrooms tomatoes etc.Our second stay was upgraded from a superior room to another one- but I dont know what it was called. This room was much much bigger than the executive! It had enough space for a settee to watch telly from. All the finishings were as above- no problems at all, and they even set up the mini fridge again with out asking! Each time I love this place even more!Finally, my last 2 stays at this hotel were in standard rooms, which didnt have as much space but enough room to house 3 medium suitcases etc. No aircon, but a fan provided but by the end of Sept we didnt really need it. The bathrooms were more compact, both rooms had the toilet sandwiched between the bath tub and counter, but it was perfectly fine. No jacuzzi though :)What really made our stays here lovely was the staff, every one from the reception to concierge were simply lovely and helpful, remembered our names from previous stays and were quick to do anything to make our stay a great one. Upon checking in after our short break in Italy I had the embarrassment of all of my credit cards being declined at reception (my bank froze my linked accounts after suspicious activity in Italy). I only had a few notes on me as I dont carry alot of cash and was having visions of sleeping outside---when the management kindly accepted my only 50 pounds as a guarantee and checked us in without delay and suggested that we phoned the bank the next day to find out what happened. The hotel normally takes out the entire amount of your stay plus extra for any items you might purchase- so I think we were very lucky that they accepted this.The location is great- only a few minutes to Harrods, great Italian cafe Orsini next door and the museums across the road. The website has good deals and I would try to book a room that states that an upgrade will be offered in available- it made a difference. Will definitely return! Will post some photos later if I can."
187,1264,"Sep 13 2005	Good Hotel: Great Location	Arrived at the Rembrandt on July 8 for a three week stay and had an executive room with a great view, clean, air conditioning, large bathroom, and mini-refrigerator. The staff was helpful and as friendly as I needed them to be. The breakfast had a wide variety of choices and there are several nice restaurants in the area, O'Fado (Portuguese), Daquise (Polish), The Oratory (English), and Bunch of Grapes (Pub). Great location and the South Kennsington tube station is just around the corner. My wife and I had a great stay in the Rembrandt and would return again."
188,1264,"Aug 25 2005	Definitely a good choice when staying in London	My flight arrived at Heathrow at 4am and it was only 6am when we arrived at the Rembrandt. As I was travelling with my wife and a 3-yr old kid, I had asked for the earliest possible check-in when I made the booking thru' ba. Actually I did not expect my room to be ready until at least 10 or 11am. I was really grateful to the staff because they had a triple room ready for us by 8am. Also from 6 to 8am they allowed us to use another double room free of charge; so we could get some rest without the need of sitting in the lobby. For the triple room we only paid the price of a double room, and free continental breakfast was provided also for my kid. The rooms are rather spacious for the standard in London, both for our triple room and also the double room that we stayed for a couple of hours. The furniture is a bit worn out but overall the rooms are clean and beds are comfortable. The washroom is not big but adequate. Water pressure with temperature control for the shower is good. However, I don't think there is any air-conditioning in the room. It can be fairly hot if you are staying in London in June/July. Also there is no mini-bar or fridge in the room, which is rather inconvenient to us.Overall we were quite happy with the Rembrandt and would definitely consider staying there if we visited London again."
189,1264,"Aug 15 2005	Perfect	Have just spent 6 days at the Rembrandt and it was absolutely perfect. I couldn't find a bad word to say about the place.We had a superior room which was huge, about 3 times the size of any other room I have stayed in in London before. There was even a radio, phone and heated towel rail in the bathroom which was also spotlessly clean. Room had fridge and tea-making facilities, hairdryer and phone and a bed big enough for four people!! Most of the staff were very nice but the girls on reception could have done with being a bit more pleasant. On checkout our room cards were taken from us and not a word was said to us, like 'hello' or 'did you enjoy your stay'. The breakfast was quite nice as well with plenty to choose from and the room was lovely as well. Harrods is a 4 minute walk away and the V&amp;A, Natural History Museum and Science Museum. Theres a McDonalds and M&amp;S Food on the way to Harrods as well which are very handy for bits and pieces. Loved the Pizza Express as well which is on the way to Harrods and just turn down the street to the right which has all the shops on it (its the only non-residential street on the way). Also highly reccomend the Bunch of Grapes pub on the corner nearby. Can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!"
190,1264,"Aug 9 2005	Appalled	I can't even begin to tell you how appalled I am with the customer service in this hotel. My son and his girlfriend stayed here in July of this year and were dealt with by the staff with a lack of concern and consideration which left them in London, on the 21st July (day of second wave of bombings) with no money, their train out of London cancelled and nowhere to stay. I have written to the General Manager and emailed every member of the management team asking for an explanation but haven't had a single reply. When staying at this hotel make sure you know exactly how they are going to take payment and how long it will be before you get your deposit back as they will not offer this information without prompting.In addition to the above the rooms were tiny and the hotel generally very shabby and in need of updating."
191,1264,"Jul 14 2005	Great hotel and neighborhood	After much research on here and other places, we chose The Rembrandt and we were very happy with all aspects of it. We arrived in Heathrow the moment the Underground/bus bombs occurred so we were pretty freaked out. We made our way into London via 2 buses and a 3 mile walk from Hammersmith. Our room was ready for us and what a welcome sight it was. Spotlessly clean, comfortable beds, great bathroom with a shower that had better water pressure than at home! The breakfast was great with a huge selection of food. We could find no fault with this hotel. Our room looked out on the V&amp;A and although we only used the Underground to go back to Heathrow, it was a short walk. We ate at Orsini's next door twice, Pizza Express a few blocks away and the delicious Oratory around the corner. Very nice experience considering London was not quite as relaxed as usual."
192,1264,Jun 23 2005	Small rooms	We stayed here in May 2005 Rooms tiny had to climb over bed to get in - we had 2 suitcases and hardly had room to put them down anywhere.Great Location though 5 minutes to Harrods and also good restaurants.The hotel lost our laundry - but eventually at 11.15pm found it in another room
193,1264,Jun 8 2005	Good Hotel - Great Location!	We stayed at The Rembrant in May of this year and loved the location and the friendliness of the staff. We booked directly with the hotel and the reservationist was more than helpful in answering all of my questions. We requested a smoking room and got a choice of rooms either in the front of the hotel or in the back overlooking a wonderful garden. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms could use some redecoration but otherwise the hotel had a unique charm. We got breakfast included in our room rate and had a wonderful choice of a buffet breakfast each morning. We will stay at this hotel the next time we are in London!
194,1264,"Apr 7 2005	Make sure you call!!!	The hotel and room was lovely. We got a great rate, however, I had to book through their website (----) and could not book a triple. Called the hotel and had a verbal arrangement, confirmed twice. Arrived and the triple king I booked was not available. We got a triple twin which was fine but disappointing. The clerk offer to throw in the child breakfast for free, we gladly accepted. Well, we never got the free breakfast for the third. We explained to the restaurant host, and the desk clerk 3 times the situation and finally gave up. The hotel is worth staying in but please call a few days before your arrival to confirm again all that you understand you are getting for your hard earned money. Again, the hotel is lovely and the rooms a very spacious. The staff was friendly and helpful. Restaurant was beautiful, English breakfast was wonderful (came with the room for two of us!). The bathrooms were big with big, deep tubs and a shower. They supply washcloths. 4 blocks from Harrods, across the street from V&amp;A, Natural History Museum, Science Museum, Royal Albert Hall. Two blocks from South Kensington tube stop (3 lines; Circle,District, &amp; Picadilly) tons of restaurants.We would stay there again!!!"
195,1264,"Mar 22 2005	Liked our stay	We have stayed in the Rembrandt for the first time. All the others times we were in London we always had to complain about the hotels. This time we did not have to. The hotel has a great location, a very friendly staff, a good breakfast and a normal price. This hotel excells also in cleanlyness, both for the room and for the restaurant and lounges. For us a good reason to come back when we visit Londen again. Nevertheless we advise the management of the hotel to refurbish some of the rooms. Not a problem yet, but within a couple of years this might be nessesary."
196,1264,"Mar 17 2005	We loved the Rembrandt	We just returned from a 6 night stay at the Rembrandt. I can't say enough about the staff. Everyone was polite and more than helpful. Everyone was always friendly. The housekeeping staff was great. You couldn't ask for a better concierge staff. Book through British airways or somewhere that will include the breakfast. The conntinental breakfast is more than enough, but it is expensive if you would have to pay for it. Some people have said they could stand to remodel, I agree some things could be replaced or updated, but everything was very clean.  The neighborhood is great. The tube station is very close. Don't hesitate to use the tube, it couldn't be simpler.  There are so many restaurants within just minutes walk. The cuisine and prices vary greatly, so you can find one to match your wallet and tastes. Might I suggest a great little Italian place just 2 bolcks up to the west, called Pierino Pizza &amp; Pasta. It was our favorite, we ate there more than once. The Victoriea &amp; Albert Museum is right across the street. The Natural History Museum is right next to that. Harrods is also right down the street in the other direction.  I would definately stay there again, and hopefully I will."
197,1264,"Feb 5 2005	very co-operative as to face flannels	I like the Rembrandt. I like it because the staff is excellent; the location great; the rooms better than some hotels given a higher rating. The location is in an excellent shopping/residential mix with easy access to the subway. I really liked it because I could get a wash cloth. I knew I needed to bring my own wash cloths to England, but, forgot them, anyway. After 1 week of improvisation I found the Rembrandt had my beloved face flannels, wash cloths! I hate to recommend it too highly everyone will want to stay there and no room for me. RJW"
198,1264,"Feb 4 2005	Worth the Upgrade	Stayed at this hotel a few times when the agent i used stopped offering the Grange Holborn. Fortunately back to using the Holborn now as i prefer the location and standard rooms there but this is a reasonable hotel.The public areas of this hotel are lovely. The bar is particularly cosy on a cold winter night and the windows of the restaurant look out onto a cute looking, traditional, residential street. Definitely one of the best inclusive breakfasts i've had in London.We've only ever stayed in the standard twin room and though clean these rooms are small, unimpressive and a bit dated. We took my parents and booked them into an executive king room - well worth the extra! The room was huge, king size bed, pleasant sitting area with sofa, large dressing table, a bigger bathroom with jacuzzi bathtub and shower and generally better decor.I would recommend anyone staying here to pay that bit extra for a much better room - i'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as my old dears!You get what u pay for and i found this to be a fairly decent hotel for the price."
199,1264,Jan 18 2005	A bit worn - but good location 	The room was on the small side of average and the bed/bedding seemed a bit old. The tub was also rather slippery and tall. Otherwise just a standard hotel with very very good breakfast which was included in our rate. The hotel is across the street from the Victoria and Albert museum and near several places to eat and a subway stop. We found it convenient and the staff were helpful.
200,1264,"Jan 3 2005	Great time over Christmas at the Rembrandt	My husband and I stayed here for nine nights in December of 2004. We were thrilled with the location - it is one of the nicest areas in all of London, very safe, close to the S. Kensington tube stop and Hyde Park. We got a $160 USD rate (including tax) through British Air, which included breakfast.The negatives first: The staff is mostly E. European and very surly; at least it will seem that way to Americans. They will not offer you anything or offer to help you unless you flag them down. But I think this is just par for the course in London. (This excludes the housekeeping staff, who kept our room spotless and were always very nice). Also, the rooms are VERY small by American standards. (We had a double bed and requested non-smoking, which was honored at check-in with no problem) I was prepared for this but my husband is tall and was annoyed at first. Again, this is just typical of London, and it actually forces you to keep your stuff neat. We weren't in the room much anyway, so this was not a big deal to us. The Positives: Everything else. Yes, the hallways and furniture are a little worn, but you can't expect the Dorchester at these prices. The room had a closet with a programmable safe (no extra charge) and tea-making things. It was spotless. CNN etc. on TV. I am very picky about the cleanliness of bathrooms and this one looked brand new, with plenty of counter space. It is still small, but better than I expected. As I've said, the location can't be beat. We felt very safe at all hours, and there are enough shops open close by for snacks and water etc. I even went running in Hyde park a few times by myself very early in the morning and never felt unsafe. This is a great area to stay - the S. Kensington tube stop has three different lines and from there you will be able to get anywhere in London with a minimum of train-changing. This is huge. Breakfast will run about $24 USD, $30 if you get the hot &quot;English&quot; breakfast, which is not worth it unless you have it included in your room rate. We just had the &quot;cold&quot; breakfast included, and it was fine for us. It was a huge buffet assortment of breads and pastries, juices, cheeses, fruits and cereals. We chowed every morning. Also, it goes from 7am to 10 am, which is nice since a lot of museums don't open until 9:30. The hot breakfast is assorted fatty garbage and not worth the damage to your arteries or wallet! As I've said, you do have to wave down the staff for your coffee, but we are ex-New Yorkers and not shy about doing this.The Gym next door is about $12 USD per day; we didn't use it, so I can't comment except to say don't expect it to be free! The hotel has a nice large lounge area with couches and a fireplace - people smoke a lot, which is a bummer, but they have a full bar and food, and free newspapers every morning. It's a good option for dinner if you have theatre tickets and don't need the hassle of finding a restaurant after a long day of sightseeing. The final MAJOR plus is that you can get from Heathrow airport to the S. Kensington tube stop! It is really easy if you can deal with schlepping your stuff, and takes 1 hr door-to-door. Considering that a taxi will easily cost $100 USD from Heathrow, the $5 USD or so tube ticket is a steal.We were there over Christmas (when NOTHING is open on Christmas Day), so we ponied up for their $75 USD Christmas Day feast in the dining room. It was awesome and, like the rest of the hotel, far exceeded our expectations.In summary, we would stay here again in a second. I have stayed in a lot of completely awful places in London, so I know how bad it can get if you're on a tight budget. Just be aware that the room will be small and the staff isn't as cheesy-happy as we're used to in the States, and you should really enjoy your stay!"
201,1264,"Dec 19 2004	wonderful hotel	We had three rooms for three different families over Thanksgiving, and the Rembrandt was an ideal location for our reunion. Comfortable lobby and bar/tea area to gather. Very accommodating for the 2 year old and for jet lag recovery, including holding the restaurant open for us very late. Fabulous breakfast. The public areas were smokey, but that's Europe. Rooms were quiet and spacious. Internet access and CNN made my husband happy. Please note that Children can only swim 9 am- 5 pm, no matter how much they and you beg.Don't forget that the Victoria/Albert Museum directly across the street stays open till 10 pm on Wedn."
202,1264,"Dec 9 2004	Noisy noisy noisy	Room was noisy, bathrobe smelt of smoke. Won't return"
203,1264,"Dec 7 2004	Thoroughly enjoyed my stay	Reserved my twin room through baholidays and neither my 80-year old mother nor I were ever disappointed with the service, our room, the continental breakfast, nor the location. I've stayed in no fewer than 15 hotels in London and for the price ($144.00) I would definitely return here. I always try to shop for hotels in neighborhoods that are safe after dark, that won't break the bank, and whose amenities satisfy my needs. I am sorry that others submitting their reviews were not pleased with this hotel. Our continental breakfast included 4 juices, a variety of breads, cold cuts, cheese, fresh sliced watermelon and casaba melon (this was mid-November), other stewed/canned fruits, hard-boiled eggs, fresh whole tomatoes, coffee, or tea. We ate heartily each morning and compared our offerings to continental breakfasts elsewhere in the world--a step up!"
204,1264,"Dec 5 2004	Good location worn pricey	I stayed in a single room, November 12-14. The room was about the size of a dorm room single and kind of spartan, but it and the bathroom were clean. What disappointed me were the common areas, the staff, and the breakfast. At check-in you had to get someone's attention as nobody seemed to want to take the next person in line. It was hard to understand the staff - English must be their second or third language. The elevators were grubby, the lobby smelled of stale smoke and really needed vacuuming the whole time I was there. Do yourself a favor and pass on the breakfast. There are so many other places to eat it doesn't make any sense to pay 12 pounds for coffee, toast, and a yogurt, which were the only halfway appetizing items they had. The hot breakfast looked nasty. By the way, the V&amp;A across the street has a great cafeteria with tasty sandwiches, hot meals, desserts... I wish I had found it sooner. The Rembrandt is an okay place, but I am trying somewhere else next time."
205,1264,"Dec 4 2004	Terrible Staff nice location	We booked a room here for 179 (room 666) and it smelled of stale smoke and looked out onto the air conditioning vents. The room was large with a good sized bed but had air conditioning humming all night. The bathroom was very large with a b-day and toiletries. Breakfast was self-service, undercooked (sausages were pink and the fried eggs were runny) and bitter undrinkable coffee was served by half asleep waiters who kept trying to take your plates away when you weren't finished. It was not up to the standard of a greasy spoon, never mind a London hotel. When checking out we had a slight problem with the bill but instead of being polite the manager used words to us such as &quot;anyone with half a brain&quot; and &quot;tough&quot; which made us leave the hotel feeling cheated by the whole experience. The location is great and if you don't have to interact with any of the staff and smoke like a chimney, you will be fine."
206,1264,"Dec 4 2004	Good family hotel	Just returned from a 5-day stay with our kid. We booked a triple and therefore got a fairly large room with a single-sized sofa bed. Hotels here generally count kids as room occupants, unlike U.S. where kids stay free. The hotel is older and has a classic, but somewhat worn feel to it. They have floors of non-smoking rooms. Our queen-sized bed was quite springy - but turned out to be comfortable. Sheets are medium/good quality. The fold-out sofa bed was one of those awful, uneven springy kinds, but any kid will be happy with it (mine was). The bathroom was tiny - tight for even one person. But it was recently fully tiled and therefore felt antiseptically clean. Fixtures (faucets, shower head) were high quality Friedriche Grohe, much better than you get in U.S. hotels. It had a large, deep bathtub. Room furniture was cheap, light-weight quality. No drawer space. Ours had trousers press, iron/board, hot water kettle with tea bags and instant coffee, large electronic in-room safe; no mini-bar but we just put drinks out on the balcony to chill! We were on the back side overlooking a small residential street so there wasn't much noise - however, it was clear that the double-paned windows provide virtually no soundproofing. I would stay away from the front of the hotel which overlooks a busy street. One nice thing about the rooms is that they have large floor-to-ceiling windows in high-ceiling rooms, so you get lots of light. Rooms were well cleaned while we were away during the day but the maid usually forgot to replenish some small item like the coffee or washcloth. The staff is entirely comprised of immigrants - friendly but not well trained. The concierges were not only incompetent but misleading. Both concierges had not only never heard about the Golden Hinde sailing ship of the 16th century, but they also had no clue who Sir Francis Drake was. He got a phone number and called but there was no answer so he said it was closed. I got the number from him and when I called later, it was the Golden Hinde Restaurant. The actual ship had been open all day. They also said the swimming pool at the adjacent health club was open 7am-5pm for kids but when we showed up they said it was closed until 12:30 due to classes. By the way, the pool is fantastic, like a Roman spa; the water is very warm, and the dressing rooms/showers are clean, friendly and during midday you get them all to yourself. But as is typical for London, there is an additional charge: pounds 7.5/2.5 for adult/kid per day. Breakfast is pretty basic quality. No unusually good items, except maybe the fresh melons. The scrambled eggs appear to be from a powder mix, the hash browns are in breaded patties like you get frozen and the fruits are from cans (like canned peaches). Get it? The coffee is reasonable - strong. I thought the service was fairly good. The hotel restaurant holds about a third of the guests so if you're late getting there on a crowded weekend there might be a wait. There is a large lounge with fireplace that is comfortable but usually people are smoking. The hotel charges 35p per minute for local calls but you should buy a phone card from a nearby store and dial out to the 0800 number - there's no hotel phone charge for that. We bought America 1st cards - calls to the U.S. were only 5p per minute! There's supposed to be wireless internet in the common areas but it costs a lot. Local internet cafes charge a pound for 15-20 minutes - I recommend the one next to the Lamborghini auto dealership (does this say something about the neighborhood?) across the street from the tube station which has a fast connection and LCD monitors (open 9am-9pm).The Rembrandt is across the street from the V&amp;A Museum, which is convenient to pop over just for an hour browse. Next door are the Natural History and Science Museums - the latter has an IMAX. All have free admission and interactive activities for the kiddies - my kid even liked the V&amp;A (go to the British Rooms). The South Kensington tube stop is about 3 blocks away. This is a very convenient station since it's on the green/yellow lines as well as the Piccadilly line which takes you direct to the theater district around Covent Garden. Families can get family day passes from the ticket vending machine - one of the few good values in town. The station's in a neighborhood with shops, covenience stores, internet cafes and restaurants. I recommend Carluccio's (Italian - informal, friendly, great food, not expensive - for desert try the affagato or vanilla gelato with thick Fiorentina chocolate), Crepes de Hampstead for a late night snack, or the Thai Square. Harrod's is a 5-minute walk down the street from the hotel. The surrounding neighborhood is very upscale. We felt safe walking the streets at night. In general, this is not the well-run luxury hotel but it's a good value (by London's expensive standards) especially for families."
207,1264,"Nov 29 2004	Thumbs Down	Pros: The lobby and reading rooms were very spacious and nice. The concierge was very kind in holding our luggage for a couple of days while we flew to Scotland. The location was AWESOME, with so much to do within walking distance.Cons: The room was too small to hold our luggage and us comfortably (two of us w/one suitcase a piece). The prices of food were outrageously high. Innapropriate materials were being advertised in the room, especially if you were to have a family staying there. The swimming pool was in the NEXT building, you had to go outside to access it, and you had to pay extra. On the website it appeared to be very much a part of the hotel. It was March when we went, so no way we were going outside wet to get back to our room. Very dissapointing. Overall, I would not stay here again."
208,1264,"Nov 29 2004	rembrant	I thought the location was great. The museum across the street is top notch, and Harrods is just up the street. The tube is about a half a mile away, and there's a handy little tea stand out front. But, the rooms are pitifully small, and expensive, for what you get, which is basically a balcony overlooking the street. We had to put half ouf our suitcases on the floor for lack of room, and we only had two suitcases. The breakfast is so outrageously priced it's not even a consideration. It's about 30 dollars per person American money. Um. . . no thanks. The staff is freindly enough, and held our bags for a few days while we ran off to Scotland. That was nice. The lobby is nice.Overall it's a nice place, if you don't plan to spend much time in your walk in closet. . . er. . . room.It's just a bit pricey. I ordered a pizza and two beers from room service and it was over 40 pounds.It won't be my first choice when I go back to London."
209,1264,"Nov 6 2004	loved it!	I have just returned from a two night stay in The Rembrandt. We were in a superior double room which was spacious and comfortable. The bed was huge! The bathroom was on the small side but then we did not go to spend time in the bathroom! We found it to be a great location within easy walking distance to Harrods and Sloane St and for reasonable cab fares to many other places.(even though the South Kensington and Knightsbridge tube stations are close by,we were being lazy!)The English breakfast was tasty and more than adequate to 'set you up' for the day and the staff were polite and attentive. I would definitely stay at The Rembrandt again and I would recommend to others."
210,1264,"Nov 1 2004	Great Hotel! Great Location!	I stayed in room 349 on October 23, 2004. Unfortunately, I only had one night in London, but when I go back, I would definitely stay at this hotel. The hotel couldn't be in a better location. Very posh London neighborhood and less than 5 minutes walk to Harrods.The hotel was extremely clean! There was even a Jacuzzi in the bathroom. The staff could have been friendlier and more knowledgeable about the area and the attractions and tours, but the overall experience of the hotel is what counts. The breakfast had plenty to choose from and the room service was delicious!When I got back to London, I will definitely stay at The Rembrandt Hotel again! :-)"
211,1264,"Oct 28 2004 	The worst hotel experience ever	I am a Front Office Manager in a 5 diamond establishment and this hotel is just dreadful. We arrived at 5pm and had to wait for our room which wasn't ready!! We arrive in the room - standard of cleanliness disgusting. Service at breakfast was a joke, we had to ask for tea and coffee (which was tepid in temperature) and toast. The most ridiculous thing of all is that you have to pay to use the leisure facilities!!!!! Over all this hotel is the worst that I have ever stayed in and I would not recommend it to anyone...quite shocking really!"
212,1264,"Oct 5 2004	We shall return!	We stayed 10 days in late September, having received an excellent deal through British Airways. We had heard all kinds of horror stories about lousy but expensive hotels in London, but I must say the Rembrandt put our fears to rest. Everything about this hotel met or exceeded our expectations. The included continental breakfast was sumptuous and the wait staff very attentive and friendly. Our room was clean and large. We would recommend this hotel unreservedly and will stay there again the next time we come to London."
213,1264,"Sep 27 2004	2nd time there and we'll go back	My wife and I recently completed our second stay at the Rembrandt in London; 9-6-04 to 9-10-04. The rooms are above average, with the usual amenities, room safe, hairdryer, but also a trouser press, a small tea and coffee locker, as well as a whirlpool tub.Service and concierge are top notch, they quickly booked us a Tower of London tour at a reasonable price. The location is outstanding, walking close to Harrods, the V&amp;A museum, Natural History musum, and Buckingham Palace. Kensington Square and Tube stops are literally outside the door.Best of all the full breakfast in the dining room, with eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, etc, included with the room was super. We got a great promotional rate from their website. This place is a winner."
214,1264,"Aug 30 2004	A Favorite- For the Money that is.	I stay in standard rooms when I stay here; it is affordable and a free huge great full english makes it a bargain. It's not as charming or english feeling as hotels in the same area/star range (raddisson edwardian vanderbilt for example) But you can't beat it at this price range. Honestly, I've stayed in blander dirtier louder places at the same price. If you are looking for something special in London, pay extra. But if you can handle a little dingy but clean decor, good for you:) Ask for extra pillows as they are thin! the staff is friendly enough to handle requests like this. The neighborhood is nice and quiet too. and the rooms arn't as small as some london hotels; you can easily have friends over."
215,1264,"Aug 10 2004	The Rembrandt is a very good value	I just returned from a week at The Rembrandt. Previous notes on this site convinced me that it had many more positive than negative points and my mother and I really did enjoy our stay (thanks to all!!!).Our room was a little small, but totally charming -- with two floor-to-ceiling windows that do open along with nice, white, guauzy curtains. We did not have A/C in our room either, but the fan (combined with low humidity outside) largely made up for the loss. But I love getting lots of sun and the hotel was full of it, from our room, to the large lobby,and the lovely and very spacious dining area. We had continental buffet breakfast included with our British Airways package and it is more than enough and quite tasty! Another pleasant surprise is that management-looking people checked on the cleanliness of the rooms and public spaces EVERY day!True, service at in the bar/lounge area outside of the dining room was spotty at best (a &quot;twist of lemon&quot; might as well have been a long, lost language phrase to the bartenders and I could have served myself much quicker), and the concierge assistance quality depended upon who was manning the desk. But the excellent front desk help, the convenience of two tube stations, a 10-minute walk to Harrod's, and a delightful neighborhood more than make up for the few short-comings. If you want a good deal for your money, don't hesitate to consider The Rembrandt."
216,1264,"Jul 20 2004	We are going back	My wife and I stayed at the Rembrandt in August 2002 for four nights. The location is superb, across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum, very close to Harrods, Buckingham Palace, and tube stops.The rooms are nicely done, older, but well cared for. The staff is very attentive, and the breakfasts are great in a very comfortable dining room.We are going back in September for four more nights. Highly recommended."
217,1264,"Jul 19 2004 	Thumbs up for The Rembrandt Hotel!	I recently spent two weeks at the Rembrandt Hotel in Knightsbridge. I shared a spacious standard double room with a friend and we enjoyed being walking distance from Harrods, Hyde Park, and Piccadily--never mind being minutes from two tube stations (South Kensington and Knightsbridge). The staff was friendly and the breakfast included was great. I especially enjoyed having discounted fees at the adjoining fitness center which provided salon and spa services (swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room). My only complaint would be that the bathroom pipes were a bit noisy at times and the room decor could use some minor upgrading. Beyond this, it was a great place to stay and I would definitely stay there again."
218,1264,Jul 17 2004	Choose another Hotel! Don't Bother with the Rembrandt	Stayed in the Rembrandt in Sept of 03. Weather was unseasonably warm and beautiful and my room had no A/C-although they provided a standing fan (can you believe it?). In addition to this my room was on the sunny side of the street which would heat the room! I think that some rooms have AC and others don't b/c my travel partner had A/C!The breakfast was less than mediocre so I would suggest a local McDonalds instead! The proximity to shopping is the ONLY thing that that this hotel can offer! Try another!
219,1264,"Jun 30 2004	Lovely Hotel	We loved the Rembrandt! Excellent location, across from the V&amp;A, many delightful restaurants nearby. Our room was clean and large (esp. by London standards) and our marvelous bathroom had a tub in which I could sink up to my neck in bubbles. The staff was friendly and helpful. Only a couple blocks to Harrod's and the neighborhood is wonderful. The only downfall was the street noise. It was a beautiful summer day so we wanted our big huge windows open, but the noise and fumes from the vehicles below was both deafening and nauseating. However, it was well worth the view of a beautiful London street. We loved it and plan to return next spring."
220,1264,"Jun 14 2004	I dont recommend this hotel	I dont recommend this hotel for 161+ a night. It should have A/C and the room where never clean properly. Would you believe that if you leave a dirty glass it would be pickup? I have to call management because for two days we had 4 dirty glasses and two buckets of ice not pickup. I guess for a hotel that they charge 5+ pounds to upgrade your breakfast of scramble eggs and hot links and that they charge 25+ pounds for cleaning a dress, it should have better rooms. Find another hotel. We stay from June 5 to June 10 and we where not able to get a phone service card in order to have room service, I had to call operator for everything, Even the room service never show up. I had to go to the bar to get ice myself and clean glasses. They even refuse to give you a bill at the end of your stay if you pre-paid your hotel. So you dont have any record you stay there, they have your credit card number......"
221,1264,"Jun 8 2004	A Very Comfortable stay	This hotel is easy to find, being almost opposite the V&amp;A museum. It is on a busy road, so ask for a quiet room not facing the front of the hotel (we could see the V&amp;A side on from our window). We had an Executive room, which had a huge bed, pillows which have seen better days, but were usable, tv/ironing board/trouser press etc. The bathroom was adequate, with a whirl pool bath to relax you after a hard days sightseeing. Air conditioning was efficient, but noticed a constant &quot;humming&quot; noise even when turned off in the room (this could be just the room we stayed in (room 653). Staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is self service, even down to the toast, which is unusual for a 4* in London, but it does set you up nicely for the day. 10 minutes walk from Harrods/Harvey Nicholls. All in all, a nice stay!"
222,1264,"May 13 2004	Lovely Hotel	Loved this Hotel! First trip to England and found our best location in The Rembrandt. Walk to the Big Bus Tour, Harrods and the V&amp;A. Friendly staff, fantastic concierge. Loved the breakfast room. Only one word of warning, the fire doors are so loud at night. Try to get a room far away from the other guests slamming these doors."
223,1264,"Apr 29 2004	Quiet location. Very nice hotel	We used to stay at the Rembrandt all the time and only switched when the Airport bus no longer stopped in front. Ask for a room overlooking the Victoria and Albert Museum...fabulous!Very cozy lounge and good food. Very good value.If you are going to the West End theatres, you'll have to take the Underground or a cab. You can walk to Harrod's though and you might be able to see it all lit up at night from your room if you stick your head out the window!I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet location who is interested in the museums. The hop-on-off tour bus also stops right near it which is a plus!"
224,1264,"Apr 14 2004	What a delight!!	Let me preface my comments by saying the only other time I have stayed in London was in a private residence that you rent by the week (found thru 'In The English Manner') and it was dynamite. So this is a first for hotel living and I found it extremely pleasant. Stayed from March 30 thru April 2. Found the price per night of $144.00 US to be a great price. The hotel upgraded us (without charge)from a 'standard twin room' to an 'executive twin room' that had a sitting area and whirlpool tub. The hotel is charming, has character, is located in a favorable area...near Harrods, across from V&amp;A close to South Kennsington tube station. The staff is helpful, congenial, welcoming. I plan to stay their again."
225,1264,"Apr 13 2004	Rembrandt	I found this to be an excellent small hotel in a great location. The lounge is very inviting, the rooms were just what a weary tourist needs &amp; it is located close to a great restaurant &amp; other facilities. The staff is excellent. A suburb bargain &amp; will probably always make it my London headquarters."
226,1264,"Mar 5 2004	Rembrandt Relaxation	We returned March 2 from 6 nights at Rembrandt Hotel. Excellent Knightsbridge location, about 3 blocks from Harrod's and Harvey Nichols. 5 minute walk to South Kensington underground. Nicely decorated, some redone rooms. We started with a smallish twin but were allowed to transfer at no charge to double bed room, a bit larger. All very quiet and clean. Excellent staff members, friendly and knowledgable. Great concierges. Good breakfasts, excellent quality dinner buffets, also alacarte items and cozy bar with fireplace. Free newspapers daily. Adjacent to a health spa with discounts for Hotel guests. Can't rate as &quot;excellent&quot; as compared to very high-end properties ie Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park which is 4 blocks away, but a wonderful price value esp. if booked through BritishAirways. We would return gladly!"
227,1264,"Feb 3 2004	Traditional and Excellent	I went to Rembrandt for my second trip to London, and my stay was as enjoyable as the first! The food was fantastic, the staff were friendly and helpful and the hotels decor was lovely! It was very warm and cosy and a joy to stay here!"
228,1264,"Jan 30 2004	Disappointing experience	Our 3-night stay at the Rembrandt was a bit disappointing.Disturbed by the guests next to our room due to poorly soundproved wall, we didn't sleep well as they watched TV until midnight and set their TV timer to wake up at 5:45am! Although we asked them to turn down the volume, we could still hear their TV distinctly.At the checkout, the cashier charged my credit card directly in USD instead of Pound using the hotel exchange rate (3% higher than the bank rate) without notifying me in advance. I noticed it afterwards on my way to the airport but it was too late.Their English breakfast is not worth spending your money. It only offers very limited variety of food.For the price I paid, I won't stay there again."
229,1264,"Jan 5 2004	Convenient location	We stayed at the Rembrandt between Christmas &amp; New Year's as part of a British Airways package. The location was fantastic but the hotel itself a bit worn around the edges.Save for one charming and helpful desk person, most staff were not particularly welcoming. It might have been the effect of the holidays and associated increased visitor volume.The hotel is quite adequate but nothing to rave about."
230,1264,"Nov 28 2003	Found Our London Home!	I found this hotel through a lot of internet searching because I was looking for a very central location, close to tubes and busses and near museums, stores and restaurants. This was perfect. When we had a London friend scope it out for us, she said that she thought it was excellent but she didn't realize that we wanted something so &quot;upscale&quot;. She was staggered at the price we were offered. We visited in November so we got upgraded; a little larger than other rooms we saw being cleaned. But the beds were good, armoire, tea cabinet, luggage rack, desk with chair, in room safe, table with two chairs and a sofa! Plenty of light which is unusual in English hotels and B&amp;B's. Bathroom had terry robes, usual amenities, marble floors and a Jacuzzi. Public rooms are nice and the staff is very friendly and anxious to serve. Amazing full English breakfast. Ambience is a little shabby around the edges (which we liked) but the brass was polished brightly and we felt warm and welcomed. And, did I mention, they have non-smoking floors! No real view because we asked for a very quiet room, but the windows opened. Can't wait to go back!"
231,1264,"Nov 14 2003	Rembrandt Hotel	I booked a room at the Rembrandt through a great website called wotif, which I discovered through recommendations by some mates from Oz, and the website offered discounted hotels all over the world, all quite cheap...and I chose the Rembrandt as it was central and close to Knightsbridge shops and the Natural History Museum. The room I had was clean and had all the necessary amenities and room service if you were feeling particulary flush! Service was good and staff were helpful, and the breakfast was nice and fresh. Overall, a great stay at a bargain price, and I would definately recommend you all to use wotif for last minute rooms on the cheap!"
232,1264,"Nov 14 2003	Everything it advertised	I stayed at the Rembrandt for 3 nights in July, 2003 and was very pleased. My room was large and clean. I loved the location; quiet enough but a block away from a metro stop and walking distance to shoppping and Buckingham Palace (it was a 20 minute walk to the Palace). The weather was gorgeous while I was there so I was very comfortable with the room temperature. It was nice to have a spa next door, although I was too busy seeing the sites to use it! I'd stay here again."
233,1264,"Nov 5 2003	Just perfect and good value too	A friend and I spent 4 nights in the Rembrandt just now (November, 2003) in a Twin Executive room, and we'd go back in a heartbeat. The room was a decent size, the bathroom very fresh and up-to-date; we loved the location right near the V &amp; A &amp; the South Kensington tube station. I was delighted with the availability of the heatlh club and spa in the building, and had a wonderful and restorative massage that improved my whole experience of London. The breakfast room is large and bright, the breakfast a standard English breakfast (hot, plentiful, with the usual weird sausages &amp; nice grilled tomatoes, and imitaiton coffe) -- we were very happy with it, and with its being included in the price. There is also a lovely lounge in the lobby, with lots of sofas and a fireplace, which we liked for a nightcap. We booked through hotel-assist for L139 in a fairly busy week in London."
234,1264,"Sep 29 2003	Staff is wonderful	The Rembrandt staff was friendly and helpful and the room was very nice and had a warm ambience to it. We had an executive king room with AC and I would recommend the rooms with AC. Heard several complain about the heat and stuffy feeling in the rooms with no AC. The upper portion of our room windows opened for fresh air. The included breakfast was generous but somewhat plain. Housekeeping was excellent. Ice had to be ordered from room service, somewhat inconvenient. Overall, a wonderful hotel and I would stay again."
235,1264,"Sep 17 2003	Would stay again	Went to London with 2 friends over Labor Day weekend. We had an executive room, the only ones with air conditioning. We were a little skeptical due to the price to stay, which included breakfast. But, thankfully, everything was great. The hotel is in a great location, close to a few tube and bus stops. The staff was nice and friendly. I would recommend this hotel for your stay."
236,1264,"Sep 16 2003	Location is great--except we may not return there	We were unfortunately in London during the great HOT spell in early August. The location for the Rembrandt is great, just a short walk from Harrods with the subway and bus stops conveniently located. BUT, the hotel is not all air-conditioned and the first night we spent in a miserably hot room with just a circulating fan which just proved to be impossible for both myself and my husband.The next day we requested and was moved UP to an air-conditioned room but the manager initially would not honor the rate we had been quoted when we reserved on the Internet. When we were ready to check out and I had the confirmation at the Internet rate, the manager on board credited me with the additional 20 pounds we had paid. Imagine my chagrin and disappointment when the credit card bill arrived and The Rembrandt had again billed us the additional 20 pounds! With management like that, we would not readily return to The Rembrandt but would look probably at Harrington Hall. We had a chance to go there during our trip and was impressed, the rate was cheaper and the rooms were air-conditioned. signed me disappointed with The Rembrandt"

1,1268,"Nov 18 2009 	Fantastic location	Stayed in this hotel for a long weekend in London and would return. The location is brilliant-between Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square. The room was lovely, the bathroom in need of a bit of work but that wasn't a big deal. We had no major dealings with the staff but they seemed nice. Got a great deal off the londontown.com website."
2,1268,"Oct 12 2009 	Excellent location	This hotel is in an excellent central location for sightseeing and theatre visits in London. Theatres are in walking distance as are many bars and restaurants. With the central location comes noise however! We were glad we took earplugs! The room was fine, bathroom a bit jaded and scruffy. The reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly and very efficient. I would certainly stay in this hotel again although I would not really describe it as 4 star."
3,1268,"Sep 14 2009 	Excellent hotel in top location	I can honestly say that this is the best hotel I have stayed in in London for sightseeing purposes. The location is superb, perfect for a theatre trip, and we found we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. The room and bed were enormous and the facilities in there pretty good, just slightly let down by a very small bathroom. Breakfast was excellent and the bar made a very pleasant setting for post-theatre dinks. Al in all, a very good experience"
4,1268,"Sep 6 2009 	Lovely hotel and great location	Absolutely lovely hotel between Picadilly Circus and Liecester Square, but on a quiet street so little street noise. Beautiful and comfortable rooms, lovely full English breakfast FANTASTIC location for London sightseeing. National Gallery and Portrait Gallery are right next store - theatre district 2 blocks away. Wonderful experience."
5,1268,"Aug 28 2009 	Unbeatable location and excellent for the money	Thought twice about booking this hotel (in a theatre deal with lastminute) after some of the older reviews here, but glad I did! Amazing location just off Trafalgar Square next to National Gallery, but remarkably quiet. We had a good-sized room on sixth floor, clean with good sound-proofing. Helpful and friendly staff too. While it hasn't got any particularly special 'character', it was perfect for a good-value short break right in the heart of the West-End."
6,1268,"Jun 13 2009 	Great location and quiet	I stayed here on a visit to see The Phantom of the Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre and this hotel was an excellent choice as it was only a few minutes walk to the theatre. The hotel is currently undergoing some exterior work but this didnt inconvenience my stay at all.My room was clean, tidy and very comfortable. Check in/out and breakfast were all fine but most importantly the hotel was very quiet which for the location was amasing."
7,1268,"May 22 2009 	loved it	The location is really nice. It is in the centre, yet it is very quite and you don't hear the buss of the Leicester square and Pic?adily as you might from some other hotels in the area. It is situated close to Pic?adily Circus and Charing Cross, so getting there is very easy from wherever in London. The rooms are nice and clean, though tiny (which is common for British hotels). I have to say that whoever was taking care of my room had a very strange idea on the use of shower caps- I got one on the first day and that was it, however, they did put in extra soap-but this is just a small thing to smile about. The breakfast was ok. The staff was friendly and helpful."
8,1268,"Mar 21 2009 	Refreshing anti-stress experience!	We stayed in this hotel for one night due to a congress in London and we were very pleased. I didn't check the reviews on Tripadvisor before this time because the hotel was booked by our secretary. However I was surprised to read such bad reviews! We noticed nothing of the sorts. The room was clean and very large, the bathroom was nice, breakfast might have been a bit more in choices but was fine otherwise (though no-one came to ask if we wanted coffee or tea). The hotel bar was nice after an evening's travel. I can't commend on the price though as we didn't have to pay it ourselves."
9,1268,Mar 10 2009 	A bit tired and in need of a refurb	Stayed here for one night whilst in London on business. Queued behind an American lady to book in and she was complaining about some of the bedrooms and I think she had been in 2 or 3 already. When I got to my room it was small with 2 single beds as my husband was joining me I rang down to reception and asked for a double which they let me change to with no problems.Breakfast was nothing special and additional but they did give you a 5 off voucher. Had a drink in the bar but not much atmosphere and a large flat screen tv had sport on. Ideally situated at the back of the National Gallery and very mnear Leicester Square so very easy to get to some of the main locations.
10,1268,"Mar 3 2009 	Fantastic 1st Experience	Well, I also was slighty cautious of this hotel due to previous reviews! Well I needn't have worried. I booked a hotel and show package with last minute.com for a surprise Birthday present for my Husband, I chose this hotel due to the fact that dinner and breakfast was included, I did upgrade the room to a suite which I had already planned to do prior to arriving as it was just 50 and well worth it. The room was huge, light and clean. The staff were top class, dinner was hot, well presented and very tasty, breakfast was equally nice, good variety and pleasent waiting staff... So we had: Hotel (upgraded room), 3 course meal, show (Blood Brothers) and breakfast, for a total of 255.86. Wow!!! We had a brilliant time,we don't often go to hotels but would definatly go back.."
11,1268,"Feb 17 2009 	Excellent spot	I was so apprehensive about staying here having read some bad reviews but I was very pleasantly surprised. Maybe it's a case of you get what you pay for.I don't know if it made any difference but I booked directly through the Thistle website. Also, I booked a 'deluxe' room which was upgraded on arrival (without asking) to a 'junior suite'. It was fabulous. Spotlessly clean and spacious. Aircon, tea-making, ironing, hair dryer, satellite tv (just in case you had time to watch tv in this fabulous city) and of course the king-sized bed. You name it, the Royal Trafalgar had it.The service throughout our stay was excellent and the staff could not have been more helpful and polite.It is a little expensive but it boasts one of the best locations in the heart of London.Saving up already for my next trip and definitely staying here."
12,1268,"Jan 26 2009 	Overbooked - Overpriced - Great location	A bad start to the trip. We arrived at around 8.00pm to be told that The Royal Trafalgar was over booked (reading other reviews I now wonder if this is a Thistle policy) and we were transferred by taxi (at the Hotel's expense) to The Thistle Bloomsbury. The taxi left us at the wrong hotel which meant a 10 minute walk with luggage to The Thistle Bloomsbury. The following day we returned (on foot although a free taxi was offered) to The Royal Trafalgar for the second night of our stay. Reception staff were helpful, the room was really very nice and spotlessly clean. The location is about as convenient as you can get for the West End (located just off Leicester Square) and yet remarkably quiet. There is an expensive multi storey car park nearby. Breakfast was good (so much better than at The Thistle Bloomsbury where we had spent the previous night). Our room rate included breakfast. Had it not, we would have dodged the 14 price tag. A very nice hotel but frankly an awful lot of money just to get a central location and over booking is unforgivable."
13,1268,"Oct 30 2008 	Royal Trafalgar - clean and comfortable hotel in amazing location	We booked this hotel through lastminute.com and got a good deal for one night that included breakfast and theatre tickets (210 for 2 people). We live in London, but thought it would be fun to stay in the city centre for a night and see London through a tourist's eyes!Firstly, the location is fantastic - right behind Trafalgar Sq. We walked to the theatre in Covent Garden in less than 10 minutes. The exterior of the building is not pretty - basically a 1960s lump of concrete and windows - but as soon as you hit reception it is bright and inviting, and the rest of the inside is equally well presented (though the air freshener smell was not to our taste and a little overpowering!). The room and bathroom were very pleasing; nothing fancy - but comfortable, clean, spacious enough and in good condition. The only negative was that the 'double' bed was in fact two twins pushed together - bit cheeky we thought.Staff were all friendly, polite and helpful and made us feel welcome and well looked after. Breakfast was as you would expect but nothing special - croissants were a bit chewy and I personally would have liked a wider selection of fresh fruit.On the way out I looked at the official room tariffs and they are incredibly steep for what the hotel is - you are clearly just paying for the location. That said, we had a lovely time and there is certainly nothing wrong with the hotel. If you want a clean, comfortable, no frills stay, then go the Royal Trafalgar (but try to get a cheap deal!)"
14,1268,"Oct 3 2008 	Simply awful	The location of this hotel is its only redeeming feature - from the minute I arrived until check out, the whole stay was exceptionally unpleasant. Rooms were not available for check-in for several hours past the advertised time, and when they were, they were cramped (even by London standards), dingy, dirty stains on the carpets, frayed curtains, with a pervading smell of damp. Even basics such as a non-slip mat for the shower had to be requested from the reception.Staff were less than pleasant (especially those serving at breakfast, who seemed to trained to shout at all the customers), and the food in the restaurant downstairs is apalling and overpriced - if you must stay here, don't eat here.As I was leaving, the door handle fell off..........I think that pretty much sums up the condition of this hotel - don't be taken in by the glossy reception area, in reality it is shabby and falling apart at the seams."
15,1268,"Sep 23 2008 	Better than I thought	I was staying at this hotel for a friends Birthday/Hen Weekend. There were 10 of us altogether, all staying twin rooms for two nights. On arrival they had our booking wrong (only 1 night and not for the night we arrived.) They sorted it swiftly and we all good rooms. The room I was staying in was very 'petit and bijoux' as it were! Very comfortable. The bathroom was very clean. Massive telly!The hotel sent up a bottle of Champagne for my friend (the Birthday girl) who had arranged the booking, as an apologie for the mix up. They had also been given an upgrade, the room was huge! I was a bit apprehensive..as I read recent reviews...we visit London at least 3 or 4 times a year..chose this hotel for its great location. Even though its right in the centre, it wasn't noisey outside and in great walking distance to many of the london attractions. Overall I was impressed and would certainly stay there on my next weekend visit."
16,1268,"Aug 5 2008 	Pleasant suprise until valuables disappeared from our room	We got a reasonable price (at least comparing with the normal price levels on hotels in London) from an internet site, and were pleasantly surprised when we got there. We went for a &quot;book a table for dinner in our restaurant and get an upgrade&quot; deal, and got a large and newly renovated room. We were happy with everything until we came back to our room one afternoon and got a strange feeling someone had been looking through our things (seals had been broken on shopping bags etc). We just laughed it off and told ourselves we were being paranoid, but when we were packing to leave the next day we realized both our mp3 players as well as some other things were missing.If I had checked into a two star hotel I could maybe have expected it, but this just shouldn't happen at a four star hotel (that's what they claim to be anyway). Reception staff agreed it sounded dodgy and contacted housekeeping, but of course no one admitted to anything. Whether it was housekeeping or not, I don't know or care, but someone with access to a key went into our room and snatched things that weren't even lying out in the open (the things that got stolen were all located in our bags). Obviously I will never stay there again."
17,1268,"Jul 21 2008 	Right Royal Mess	Stayed one night at the 'Royal Trafalgar' Last week. Not by choice and would never stay there again. We were forced to stay here as the Thistle Piccadilly overbooked and shuffled us down the road at nearly midnight to this 'sister' hotel. We finally ended up with a room after lots of problem and the room we had was a dump. 2 * at best. Carpet threadbare, wallpaper coming off, windows and doors couldn't close. I will never stay at a Thistle hotel again because of this room and their overbooking fiasco. (see review on Piccadilly)Location was the only thing going for it."
18,1268,"Jul 14 2008 	Filthy	THIS SHOULD NOT BE CLASSED AS A 4 STAR! Stayed here for 2 days and was well cheesed off. First of all i booked a double Jnr suit, when i arrived at the room you couldn't swing a cat in it and had single beds.(not good when you are celebrating you 21st wedding aniv). They got us another room bit bigger. I then tried to have a bath i would have had to run it at least an hour before as the watter was so slow running. after 5 mins got fed up and changed my mind and thought a shower would be better.The watter wouldnt run away and to my horror found the reason why. the plug hole was full of thick black hair, and since am blonde i knew they didnt come from me."
19,1268,"Jun 30 2008 	Great location decent stay	Hotel has great location. Reception staff very friendly. Room I was allocated was huge and had double aspect views of the city from the 6th floor -very nice, but lower floors will not have such good views as with most big city hotels. Also little touches for the upgrade were worth it - bottles of water, a few chocolates, big flat tv, slippers and bath robe. The beds were extremely comfortable and there was plenty of extra seating, and work areas. Toiletries were very nice. On the downside, the bathroom was small but adequate. The shower was very hot and powerful. Breakfast was good and the staff were very attentive."
20,1268,"Jun 29 2008 	Great Value For Money	We chose this hotel as we had booked to see the musical Marguerite and it was near the theatre (a two minute walk away, in fact).The location was excellent and we could walk to all the places we wanted to go rather than rely on taking the tube everywhere. We checked in quickly and the staff were very pleasant indeed. The room didn't appear that big but then the bed was massive so took up quite a bit of space (but not a problem at all). A great flat screen tv was in the room, which was unexpected. Complimentary tea and coffee in the room also. And a hairdryer and an iron/ironing board were also provided.The bathroom was small, but who needs a large bathroom anyway? The shower was nice and powerful and the usual complimentary shampoo/conditioner/shower gel etc were all provided.Can't comment on the food as we didn't eat there. The bar was a nice relaxing place to finish the night off with the last drink of the evening.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a nice quiet location but still in the centre of the action."
21,1268,"Jun 22 2008 	Very Nice !!	The Thistle Trafalgar or Royal Trafalgar is in an excellent location, its a little tricky to find by car even with sat nav, but three times around the block and we got there.Reception staff were very curtious and efficient, especially when the four rooms we booked for a business trip were upgraded free of charge to four suites.The suite was very impressive,large, and clean.(See photos). The breakfast was fine, not a buffet but ordered at the table. Overall I would definately stay at the hotel again, there is an NCP carpark 30 yards up the road which is very convenient, making this an ideal Hotel with walking distance to all the attractions."
22,1268,"Jun 8 2008	Only if you must	If you have no other options, then I suppose that this hotel would be okay however, it is nothing more than a horrendously overpriced bed to sleep in. The carpeting in the room was threadbare, the wallpaper was peeling in spots, the towel rack fell off the wall when I removed the towel, and the shower was moldy. Stay there only if you have no other options. The only saving grace is the good location."
23,1268,"May 16 2008 	Unrivalled location	My wife and I stayed here for a couple of nights theatre and food in London. The hotel is behing the national portrait gallery but didn't suffer from any traffic noise (in our room at least.) It is smack in the middle of theatreland and is very handy for the tube to boot. You are a stone's throw from Trafalgar square, Piccadilly, Circus, Leicester Square and a couple of minutes walk from Covent garden, Big Ben and Embankment (ie Old county Hall, aquarium, London eye.We got a free upgrade on arrival, so can't comment on peoples' criticism of the basic twin rooms - our upgraded room was very nice. Plenty of room, clean, comfortable, good TV, safe, iron etc etc etc.We didn't have any main meals in the restaurant, but breakfast was very good, room service fine, and also quick and accurate (which you rarely get in London!).We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly, far and away the best we've encountered in London. We went through a rebooker for an overall package with train tickets, Theatre tickets etc so our value perceptions may be skewed by this, but taking the quality of service, unrivaled location and cleanliness into account, this is the hotel we'll be returning to en route to Paris in September."
24,1268,"Apr 26 2008 	Okay for what you pay	After booking and cancelling several London hotels, we settled on Thistle Trafalgar based primarily on price and location - and got about what we paid for. As long as you're planning on using the room as a base only, this is a pretty good place to be - however, I would NEVER recommend to anyone to book a standard twin room at this hotel. On arrival, despite booking (and paying for) the night prior based on a 7am check-in from a long haul flight, there was no room available except a smoking room. We were so tired and grotty we accepted - BIG mistake. Room really reaked and when we tried to open the windows and turn on the air conditioner, we found windows stuck and air conditioning on floor 4 - in this room at least - is non existent, which the maintenance man informed us when he came to &quot;fix&quot; it!! On complaining to reception that this was not what we'd booked or expected, they offered to upgrade us to a deluxe twin room - but not before 2pm. The upgraded room was significantly better than the first. New room was still very small, but the location of the hotel is so good you're really only in the room to sleep anyway.We left feeling we'd done okay, however had the upgrade and room change not have eventuated our 4 days in London would have been fairly miserable!!"
25,1268,"Mar 26 2008 	Nice hotel but watch out for 'included' meals!	I booked this hotel through work as I had a meeting the next day, but took my partner to see the sights and certainly wasn't disappointed when I arrived, as it was right in the heart of Trafalgar, on a road running parallel to the National Gallery and behind Leicester Square itself. Despite its location it was nice and quiet, and you're also 5 mins walk from about 5 different tube stations, so perfect for getting around town too.The room was very nice with a HUGE bed and flatscreen TV and plenty of wardrobe space. The bathroom wasn't that great but that's not the sort of thing that bothers me much.I would have said this hotel was excellent but I do think you should watch out for the 'included' breakfast and dinner which I think is a total scam:When my partner and I arrived I was told dinner and breakfast were included, although my travel agent with work had said it was room only. I thought this was great but was a little suspicious, as I noticed on the restaurant menu that dinner was around 30 a head for 2 courses without any drink, and I only paid 115 for the room. I did question them at the time and they assured me it was included. When we later went down for our 'free' dinner I was very suspicious and pushed for details, and it turned out that what they meant by 'included' was that the expense of our dinner and breakfast for two would be charged back to my work's travel agent, who would have subsequently called my office to ask for the payment. I'm quite sure this would have led to me being fired! I'm so glad I asked!!Anyway despite that this IS a nice hotel, the staff were extra friendly and the bar and restaurant were very good although why you would want to eat in the hotel when you're 5 mins walk from Chinatown / Covent Garden/ the whole of London I don't know! I would stay here again, mainly for the convenience of the location but it is a nice base too."
26,1268,"Mar 10 2008	Ideal Location Hotel Satisfactory	Me and my boyfriend have just returned from a two night stay at the Thistle Trafalgar Square (now called Royal Trafalgar). We chose this hotel due to the reasonable price and close proximity to the West End Theatres (we had booked to see a couple of shows beforehand for my birthday). The location was absolutely fantastic, it was set on a quiet street and was just a very short walk to the theatres, Chinatown and was located right between Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square. Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Mayfair are also just a short walk away. This is an ideal choice for a Theatre/Shopping Break or if you want to be in the centre of all the action! The hotel itself was extremely good value considering you are in the centre of London- there was no need for taxis or the underground throughout our stay as everything we wanted to see was right on our doorstep. We booked fairly last minute and were told we had a twin/double room on our booking confirmation, which was vague. When we arrived we were actually given a twin room as they were fully booked and had no double rooms left. This twin room was very small and cramped and the bathroom was also very small (the bathroom door hit the toilet due to lack of space). However it was light, airy, clean and modern with a huge widescreen T.V! Obviously, we would have preferred a double room, but this didn't spoil our stay too much as we didn't spend alot of time in our room really! One thing that did annoy me though was that we couldn't get into our room on the second day as they had changed the code for our key! I know this is for security but I was a bit confused as to why they didn't inform us that they do this when we initially checked in!! When we went down to investigate there were quite a few other people compaining that their key didn't work, so do bear this in mind!I can't comment on the food/restaurant as we didn't use these facilities (cheaper to eat out as there are so many places on your doorstep including Chinatown if you're a fan of Chinese Food like me) but the hotel bar is very nice and modern.Overall I would definately go back to this hotel again, purely for the excellent location. I would try and book a bigger/superior room (if possible) next time if going with my boyfriend or if going for more than one night as the Twin Room we had was quiet small and cramped. The staff were helpful and did try to get our room changed for us but unfortunately as they were fully booked there were no other rooms avaialble, so make sure you book in plenty of time if you require a bigger room."
27,1268,"Mar 10 2008 	Perfect Location	The Thistle Trafalgar Square is ideally located for all the major tourist spots - directly round the corner from the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, only two minutes walk to Leicester Square; five minutes from Piccadilly Circus.Reception staff were pleasant and stored our case whilst the room was being prepared - we arrived fairly early. Consierge gave clear directions and was extremely helpful.We were allocated a Junior Suite on the fifth floor (Room 502) which was extremely spacious, scupulously clean, with complimentary tea, coffee etc and a welcome plate of fruit. Noise was kept to a minimum with double glazing and thick curtains. The room was warm and welcoming (with pictures of Limone on Lake Garda - reminding us of a wonderful holiday we took there some years ago!)Breakfast was fine with a good selection of fruit, cheese, rolls and a full English breakfast on offer - which could set you up for a full days sight-seeing!I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - it is excellent value, ideally located, with pleasant and welcoming staff."
28,1268,"Feb 29 2008 	Functional	Although I booked the hotel for two rooms and specified my wife was staying with me, they gave my colleague the double on the 6th floor and me the tiny twin room on the 4th floor- but too late in evening to change!. All I can say its functional. Showers fine if your under 5 foot and make sure you turn it on way before you want a hot shower. I did ask for extra towels but never turned up so had to use the wet one my wife kindly left me. Avoid twin rooms, insist on extra towels. For 152 a night I thought it was way over priced for a chain like thistle. would look around a bit more next time.Very good and friendly staff at reception, easy check out."
29,1268,"Feb 24 2008 	For London - Adequate but what can you expect?	Booked for one night due to late business commitments in the Capital.Staff friendly and helpful. Shared areas were bright and modern as were corridors etc. I booked a single room but was allocated a room with a double bed which suited me.The room was small (very) I was on the forth floor and most of the rooms seemed to be this size from what I could discern - other floors are probably better sized(?). Essentially it had a double bed in it and ...basically that was it. I have seen other pictures on this site showing a twin room - my room was the same except the double bed replaced the two singles and is turned 90 degrees. The result is that you cannot get to the window apart from climbing over the bed. Also if you were sharing with someone, one person is trapped up against the wall and would need to climb over the other person to get to the bathroom during the night (as necessary). The TV was again OK but signal on most channels, of which I think there were 4 terrestrial feeds only, was pretty poor.The bathroom - small, tired and dated - shower didn't work too well and it smelled a tad but about acceptable.Bed as with most things was OK, would be snug for 2 particularly as it is up against the wall along one side.I paid a 116 which included a fine English breakfast in a nice dining area - again the staff were friendly and helpful."
30,1268,"Feb 23 2008 	So-so hotel terrific location	Don't know what's up with the Thistle hotels and their 'upgrade' policy. We traveled on business and my colleagues were 'upgraded' to a much better room than they'd booked primarily because they'd hung around the lobby waiting for a room (we'd arrived at 6 a.m.) whilst we were out and about until 2 p.m, w/c is supposedly when check-in is. Got back at 2, found our room to be infinitesimal (we'd booked a deluxe) and objected. Were shown to another room immediately, but had to pay an extra 20 for it. Meanwhile, my colleagues got the EXACT same room minus the extra 20. What gives? Management supplied me with a very lame excuse. Decided not to argue because we were just too tired. Most of the hotel staff do not speak english very well altho' the restaurant staff was very courteous and attentive. Front desk staff was mediocre. Central location. Perhaps that's why they think they can get away with shabby service."
31,1268,"Jan 11 2008	Bad surprise turned good!	We arrived in London on 29 December 2007 and were very skeptical about our choice of hotel having read horror reviews on the hotel after our booking. To our dismay, the 200 euros per night per room were far from justified for the stuffy, poky and dark room we were led to. The reviews were right!We then decided to call reception to tell them that the room was too hot to sleep in and they offered to upgrade us to a superior room. The new room was just as the travel brochure showed - spacious, bright and very comfortable. It was worth every penny.As for the location, you will never be disappointed regardless of your room rate!We highly recommend the breakfast that is hearty and served in nice surroundings."
32,1268,"Jan 2 2008	Don't trust a confirmed booking here!	Confirmed and pre-paid booking for a double room through e-bookers. Requested non smoking double-arriving after 4.30pm. Arrived 19.30 to be told that no rooms available at this hotel due to maintenance problems and for security reasons some of the rooms were out of use?? I asked which rooms and why - they couldn't give an explanation. They offered an alternative hotel near Regent Street, this was the one that had loads of availability because it is nowhere near the fireworks! or Trafalgar Square! and not within walking distance when you are recovering from a broken knee! There is also no transport available and the roads are closed on New Years Eve with 700,000 people there for the fireworks!! Anyway, the next day, they admitted to e-bookers that they had overbooked (so the duty manager lied to me)....and they had wrongly allocated their bookings. We had no choice but to settle for a mattress on the floor of a single room, or sleep in their foyer. The single room was a smoking room (disgusting odour), with wallpaper peeling off walls, carpet not attached to the floor and mouldy secondary double glazing in a 70's bathroom - they charged us 154.16 for the single room, although E-bookers had already paid 186 for a double. Response on check out was 'we strongly recommend you write to our manager - he is back 2/1/08'......... Don't rely on a confirmed booking at this hotel."
33,1268,"Nov 16 2007 	Great location dreadful hotel	I needed an overnight in London at the time of the World Trade Fair, so hotel rooms were difficult to find. Was charged 129 for the night and I left wishing I'd rather travelled home than stayed there (I would have got more sleep on the train).The staff at check-in were very friendly and I was optimistic about the hotel when I checked in as the public areas are really nice, modern and clean. I was given room 437, so needed to take the lift to the 4th floor. The lifts are tiny and the creaking sounds they made did not give me any confidence at all.I got to my room and was disappointed to find it was a twin room. It was a bright sunny day, but the room was really dark. The decor is very 70's and is in need of redocorating. The bathroom was dreadful, with a small dim light, which I guessed was there to hide the awful cracked tiles and the shower I refused to use. (I took some photos which are posted here).The room was over a side street and I had taxis and motorbikes in particular going past my window every 10-15 minutes during the night, so had no chance of sleep. (I live in the country so I suppose I may notice noise more).Overall if you want a good location ( 5 mins from everywhere on foot) and don't care where you stay then this is the hotel for you, if you can get a good price. If you are looking for somewhere nice to stay, keep looking!"
34,1268,"Oct 5 2007 	good location good value	Stayed for three nights.excellent location ,very quite(except for the loud Americans leaving at 6.00am who felt the need to tell everyone else about their travel plans). Unlike some of the other reviewers I found the staff pleasant and efficient,with a good command of English. Our room was large. Parts of the hotel are a little tired and the reception area is quite small,but at the price for a central London Hotel, this is excellent value. Will stay there again."
35,1268,"Oct 1 2007 	Great location - avoid twin rooms!	As other reviewers have said, the best thing about this hotel is the location. It's right next door to the National Gallery and Trafalgar Square. When shown to our room we were disappointed to have been given a twin room barely large enough to swing a cat, as they say! The reception staff were very helpful and gave us a large double room with plenty of space for cats to be swung in! The room was very clean and well appointed with all the stuff you would expect, TV, coffee and tea making facilities, safe, air con (not that you need it in London). The only negative point was that the shower was designed for someone under 5ft tall which I'm not! The hotel staff, although very friendly were almost exclusively foreign and some had quite poor english which made things difficult. If you want somewhere ideally located for the theatres and sightseeing then you can't go far wrong."
36,1268,"Sep 17 2007 	Excellent location nothing else	It was my fault that I didn't do my research properly and showed up at the Charing Cross Thistle by mistake. In retrospect, I should have stayed there.The T-Square Thistle has an excellent location, but that's about it. Not being English myself, communication at check-in with another foreigner was difficult. Finding housekeeping going around knocking on doors at 4 in the afternoon asking guests if their rooms had been cleaned was suspicious. But the upsided down painting in the room - that was just ghetto.The twin room was very tiny, we would have been better off staying at a B&amp;B for half the price. Had to catch an early flight the next morning so we weren't able to make use of any of the other amenities of the hotel."
37,1268,"Jul 31 2007 	Thistle TSq - Decent hotel; great location	We (my sister, brother and I) gave my mom a trip to London for her 75th birthday and she insisted the extended family stay here (she'd been here several times) which we did for several days this past July. Hotel is equidistant between Leiciester Square (with TKTS booth) and T-square. Right next to Portrait Gallery.Rooms w/twin beds are quite small but clean enough and some actually have a view of the London Eye (which changes colors at night!) The rooms with king beds are more spacious. Maids insisted on giving us one set of towels even though it was obvious two people were staying in the room. Desk staff was pleasant and helpful but automatically recoded all our room keys every day of our stay which was particularly annoying. Full English Breakfast was delicious and worthwhile since filling up and grabbing a croissant and &quot;banger&quot; for lunch would easily hold you till dinner. They even got my lactose-intolerant brother some soy milk. Didn't have any other meals there or visit the pub.Best thing about the place is its central location. Easy walk to every major west end theater, Soho, Covent Garden, Picadilly Circus, wherever. Pretty close to L-square tube stop."
38,1268,"Jul 25 2007 	Fantastic Stay	Stayed one night at The Thistle whilst catching a Eurostar train the next morning. From arrival with the helpful, friendly staff at check in (received an unasked for upgrade to an executive room) to the excellent room service, cooked to order breakfast and finally the swift and efficient check out the next morning (including flagging down a taxi) this short stay was memorable for all the right reasons. Will definitely be returning to stay for longer and make more use of the superb location."
39,1268,"Jun 19 2007 	Hated the Thistle Trafalgar Square	We stayed for 3 nights on a theatre break. The location was central and the hotel public areas were in reasonable condition but the double room we stayed in was shabby, not very clean and the whole decor was pretty poor, not what we expected from this chain or at this ptice. Communication with staff proved difficult due to their poor English and lack of knowledge."
40,1268,"May 15 2007	great location crap hotel	the hotel is situated in one of the best locations in London, next door to the National Gallery and a stone's throw from the West End.Rooms are cramped, service mediocre, decoration awful."
41,1268,"May 12 2007 	Great Location Below Average Hotel.	The location of the Thistle Trafalger Square is excellent - right next to Piccadilly and Leicester Square.The hotel itself however I found to be well below average. Rooms - at least the standard ones - are absolutely tiny - even for London standards, which says a lot. Once you entered the room you can do a 360 degree and that's about it. The desk was basically unusable with everything (TV, phone etc) cramped onto it. Furniture and room decor are old and tired with the bed beeing quite uncomfortable. Service at the front desk was slow and when we went for a drink at the bar at night we felt most unwelcome - like we added some extra burden to the staff.On a more positive note, one can say that everything was quite clean though."
42,1268,"Mar 27 2007 	Superb Location Nice Hotel too!	Me and my bfriend stayed at this hotel for one night, booked it thru asiarooms.com, who were the cheapest at the time of booking 119. Although on checking the Thistle's own website two days before - their price had dropped to 120, incl brekkie, but some may think this is a bit risky leaving it that late when trying to plan a weekend getaway?The location is superb. 5 mins walk to Trafalgar square, Piccadily Circus, and only around the corner from where we went to see Phantom ( Her Majesty theatre).Room was nice , although bathroom was a little dated.Breakfast was great - loads to choose from.Staff great and very friendly, always smiling.But overall the hotel's location is it's best asset ! Spot on !"
43,1268,"Mar 11 2007	Excellent Hotel 	We had booked tickets to see the show Mama Mia at the Prince of Wales Theatre In the West end.The Thisle was chosen as it seemed central.We were pleasantly surpised to find that it was 3 minutes walk to the theatre.It was the same the other way to Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery.The Hotel was very good.The room was warm and comfortable.Breakfast was excellent.The reception staff were efficient and very helpful and friendly.They are with you in a few seconds and at one time 3 asked if they could help.You have everything nearby just about 10 minutes stroll to Westminster Bridge therefore close to the London Eye,several theatres are close as you are close to Leicester Square and Piccadilly.A very good Hotel which We will stay at when in London again."
44,1268,"Aug 8 2006 	Completely lets down the Thistle brand	The first thing you notice about the hotel is the musty smell, it hits you as you walk through the doors. We paid extra for the &quot;deluxe&quot; room which was really cramped. I cant imagine what the standard rooms must have been like. The bathroom was in terrible condition and hadn't been updated for about 20 years. My head was touching the ceiling when in the bathtub for a shower.Staff were friendly enough but took half an hour to check out three guests when we were leaving - very frustrating !!Having stayed in many Thistles, I expected this hotel to offer a similar level of comfort but was very disappointed. Needless to say, will be looking elsewhere in future."
45,1268,"Jul 27 2006 	Not bad but don't do the Express Checkout !	Excellent location, as others have noted. Room was clean and usually quiet (walls a little on the thin side). Good sized rooms, nice big tub for soaking weary feet. Restaurant was average for breakfast. Dinner was much better. Staff were very helpful. However, DO NOT DO THE EXPRESS CHECKOUT, especially if you are a business traveller and need a receipt for your expense claim. They are supposed to mail you a copy. I waited four weeks and then sent an e-mail. No reply whatsoever. I then contacted their customer care people, who sent them another e-mail. That was a couple of weeks ago. Its been two months now and I am still waiting !!!"
46,1268,"Jul 6 2006	Excellent	I have stayed in this hotel twice now. Once 4 years ago for my 21st birthday and now 4 years later and it is still a lovely place to stay. The location is fantastic as Trafalgar Sq, Leicester Sq and Piccadilly are all within a few yards so no need for expensive taxis. The hotel is clean and friendly. We were told on arrival that we had been given a complimentary upgrade which was a very impressive room with windows all around making it light and airy. The only thing I would say is that a valance sheet would have looked better on the bed (that is really picky - i know!). I cannot fault the staff and was very impressed at how quiet it is on a morning (no clattering cleaners outside the door as there is at other hotels) I will most definitely book again"
47,1268,"Apr 24 2006	Great Location!	Stayed at this hotel in april for the second time, but this time a bit dissapointed, I booked a deluxe twin room but it was very small although newly refurbished! no other extras and differences between this and standard! I did complain but all the junior suites were booked up as it was half term! The location is excellent however just off leicester square and trafalgar square! Lots of lovely restaurnats nearby also. prob wouldnt stay here again, will stick to the five star hotels!! Did see Billy Elliot at the theatre which was brilliant!"
48,1268,Apr 17 2006	Fantastic Hotel Great Staff	Fantastic Hotel and a great location. Very good value from booking online. On arrival upgraded to a junior suite. Plenty big enough for our family of 4. Very clean and quiet and the staff were excellent. Breakfast in the morning was tasty and filling with a great selection of hot and cold items. Any people who are critical of this hotel are either picky or unlucky. On our next trip we will stay here.
49,1268,"Mar 31 2006	Location location location	This hotel gets 4 stars for the location. The hotel itself is fine, but the location is fantastic. You are steps from Trafalgar Square, Picadilly Circus, theatres, shopping and all the transportation options. The hotel is directly behind the National Gallery. It could use some updating. The carpets are worn and there is some chipped paint, but it is clean and the rooms are a decent size for London. The breakfast buffet is good if a little boring. The beds are comfortable and the staff is willing. This is my second stay here. I recommend it highly. Just remember, it is not the Ritz. It is not badly priced and they do have specials."
50,1268,"Mar 12 2006	Not luxurious but pleasant and clean...very good location...pricey.	Great bed and linen. Immaculate room and bath.Helpful staff. 2.5 blocks from Picadilly, so a great location. Room rates seem high, but it is London...and London is marvelous. We would stay in this hotel again."
51,1268,"Mar 9 2006	Great Location. Good if you can get a cheap deal.	We stayed here as part of a package that I won online so I cannot comment on price. The staff were not unfriendly but nor did they go out of their way to make us feel welcome. Room size was fine although it was an executive room so I wondered what the standard rooms were like.Overall, the room, sheets and towels were clean and the bathroom quite modern but the curtains needed mending and a valance sheet over the base of the bed would have made a world of difference. A mini bar as well as coffee in the tea- and coffee making tray would have been welcome. Breakfast was a bit of a let down. The food and drinks were a bit tasteless and the sausages overcooked but I did enjoy the croissants. We had a pleasant stay but I am glad I did not have to pay for it!"
52,1268,"Jan 23 2006	Great location very clean	We stayed at the Thistle Trafalger Square for one night on 21st January and were pleased with it. Check in was quick and efficient, our room (number 324) was very spacious and spotlessly clean. There were windows on two walls as it was on a corner which gave lots of natural light. Lots of fluffy towels but strangely only one bathrobe. As our room was at the end of the corridor, with only one other room adjacent to it, it was extremely quiet overnight as no-one had to pass our room to get to theirs. The heating was very easily adjusted so we had a comfortable night. Breakfast was the usual buffet style with good quality, hot food. The breakfast room is the hotel's restaurant and while fine for breakfast was a bit bland and characterless for dining, but let's face it there are hundreds of eateries in London so you don't need to eat dinner at the hotel anyway (Quaglino's is highly recommended!) We stay overnight in London quite regularly to save rushing for the last train home. We have stayed at the Selfridge before but were a little disappointed; we would stay at the Trafalgar Square again. All in all a very nice stay in a clean hotel in a great location."
53,1268,"Oct 31 2005 	Depending what you want	I stayed there for 3 nights. It has its pros and cons really depending on what you want. ProsExcellent location at the heart of West end with all theatres and good restaurants. Yet a block behind the noisy street to have a decent sleep. Room provided with tea pot with &quot;Twinnings&quot; and hot chocolate free. Nothing more to expect from a 3 star accomodation. The bed was comfortable and the rate of slightly more than a hundred pounds a night is a good deal.ConsThe hotel is very old and the maintenance is poor. My room had a faulty light and a shower with the temperature controlled out of order. With the not so clean tub, I prefer to use the shower and had to turn the water real slow to avoid burning myself with the unadjustable switch.If you just want a place to sleep which is cheap and convenient, it is okay. But certainly not a place that you enjoy to stay."
54,1268,"Oct 30 2005	Great Location - Quiet	Took my daughter to London in Oct. after taking my son in Feb. Stayed both times at Thistle Trafalgar Square.Location can't be beat; walking distance to most everthing in West End or an easy tube commute.Room was always clean and quiet (remember, though this is not the Savoy, and neither are you paying Savoy prices).Small language barrier with some of the staff, but James (consierge) was always very helful.Second time staying there and I'll use it again."
55,1268,"Oct 17 2005	Scruffy hole	My daughter and I have just come back from London after booking this hotel with 'Lastminute'. What a disappointment; their webiste gave it 8 out of 10, a joke surely. The hotel is scruffy, dirty and smelly. The room we were allocated (deluxe) was tiny, dark, and dinghy. Behind the net curtains the windows were rotten, flaking paint and a not too nice smell. We were patiently told at reception that they had 3 room types and for an extra 20 we could be upgraded to an executive room - hurray!! So on to room 623 it was. The only thing I could see any different to the Deluxe room (apart from the extra 20 coming out of my bank account) was a 'free' small bottle of water. Although all the staff were pleasant enough and the location great, I wouldn't waste my money here again."
56,1268,Jul 22 2005	allergy sufferers bypass this one	If you suffer from asthma or allergies this is not the hotel for you. This hotel is in bad need of an up dating. The carpets reek of smoke and years of neglect. The rooms are tiny and have your grandmas drapes and bedspreads. The hotel is on a small one way street but the noise at night makes it hard to have a sound sleep. The hot water was iffy and the bathrooms were moldy and very unattractive. There was no storage for luggage or even toiletries in the bathroom! The staff was a bit cool towards the guests but I suppose they get alot of complaints and are prepared for the worst. I was moved twice before I got a room I was satisfied with. They told me the third room was a newly remodeled room.... I wondered what it looked like before.
57,1268,"Apr 27 2005	No cold water!	I booked this hotel for a theatre break with my mother and must say I was extremely disappointed. The room was on the small side and the decor was old and scruffy. There were numerous rips in the curtains. There was no water coming out the cold water tap and when we complained to the staff we were told that nothing could be done as the maintenance staff do not work over the weekends. Finally, to top it all off, the room was very noisy during the night with a constant stream of police sirens and loud groups of people easily audible through the pathetic attempt at double glazing. Upon check out from the hotel I complained to the hotel manager who advised they could not offer me any refund as we had paid for the hotel in advance. The best he could offer was a discounted room on my next stay. I declined. All in all, this hotel is not up to 4 star standard and should be avoided if possible."
58,1268,"Apr 14 2005	very good hotel	My husband and i stayed here for a weekend and found this to be a great hotel.The rooms were large and well kept bathroom was larger than some other hotels' rooms. The breakfast was great, only thing is having to wait for a table.We would stay here again."
59,1268,"Apr 13 2005	Great quiet location!	We stayed here for 3 nights in mid March. I had previously stayed here last year and came back again. It did not disappoint. We had a deluxe suite, very spacious, twin beds and a double sofa bed. The bathroom was large and clean, as was the entire room. We backed onto the National Gallery so it was incredibly peaceful overnight despite being in the heart of Leicester Square. Staff were all friendly and polite. Close to several tube stations (Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus and Charing Cross) accessing all the major lines. Only down side is the small breakfast room- we had to wait one morning for a table to become available but apart from that I enjoyed another excellent stay."
60,1268,"Nov 3 2004	Terrible for a four star rating	This last weekend I stayed at Thistle Trafalgar Square. To begin with I decided to go for an executive twin to get a bigger room - the room I got was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in, in fact I have stayed in a couple of 3 star hotels and the rooms there were better. I asked for email confirmation of my booking and didn't receiveone. It was a noisy room due to the &quot;fan&quot; in the bathroom being loud and unable to be switched off. The sink plug was faulty so the water drained VERY slowly. My toast was served without a plate or butter. I was most disappointed in the hotel. I have stayed in numerous 4 and 5 star hotels all over the world and this was the worst ever."
61,1268,"Nov 2 2004	Best location	I and my friend and 2 nieces stayed at the Thistle for 3 nights at the end of the half term. He had a single room on the 4th floor which was tiny. The bed was up against the window and there was no air conditioning. He did suffer a bit but managed to open the window for some air but unfortunately he then had to put up with the noise from outside. He did say altough the room was small he was comfortable. Myself and nieces had a studio room on the 5th floor which was spacious. The massive king size bed was more than adequate for the girls to share and I had a very comfortable sofa bed. The lack of air conditioning was a problem and would only go down to 16 degrees and no less. We only used the restaurant for breakfast and this was o.k. On the 2nd night in the early hours the fire alarm went off and we all had to go outside. The fire brigade were there immediately. The only thing was, there was not a single member of staff that came out to reassure anybody. We all went back in like sheep but still no staff. I can only assume that the firemen gave the all clear. The location was great and we couldn't have wished for better. We walked easily to Leicester Square and Piccadilly with all the restaurants and shows etc. Trafalgar Square just round the corner and Chinatown a very short walk.We walked back to the hotel from Oxford St. after visiting Hamleys toy store etc and this was no problem for little legs! The hotel was very clean and staff were very polite and helpful. Being so central you do have to allow for the noise at night but this was not really a problem.I would recommend this hotel for the location without a doubt.We had very enjoyable time. The Thistle Piccadilly is only up the road 2 minutes so this would be another option which looks good from the outside."
62,1268,"Oct 14 2004	Great Location	This was my first trip to London and I was delighted with the location of this hotel. Our decision to stay here was based on the reviews we read on this website. It is truly centrally located and because it is on a small alley the noise is reduced, not as bad as other hotels in the area. We had some problems with our first room but staff could not have been nicer. Some rooms are quite big and others are very tiny. We had both. The bed was comfortable. I agree with others that the decor is tired but everything was always clean and it suited our needs. I don't spend much time in my room anyway when on a trip. We paid 96 pounds/night including breakfast. Not bad for London. The half off theater ticket booth in Leicester Sq. is only a block up the street. We walked to plays every night and were also able to walk to so many of the popular sights within minutes. The tube and bus (multiple lines) were right there if we didn't want to walk."
63,1268,"Oct 10 2004	A fantastic location...	Spent 7 nights at Thistle Trafalgar. Rates were quite good. As to be expected, room was rather small but clean and comfortable. Look at the diagram on back of door for fire exits and you can see the different room sizes. My friend upgraded to a family &quot;suite&quot; which is the one they like to picture on their website with windows all around. Very spacious. They even get better toiletries! Location...well, could not be better. Stone's throw from Leicester Square, where you will probably choose to eat. I only ate breakfast at this hotel but it was DIRE. I am familiar with full English breakfast and have had quite good food at other London hotels. This really is not good. But..despite this I do recommend the hotel. You just have to find somewhere else to have breakfast. Nice sandwich shops right across the narrow street in front. Right around corner is National Gallery and Trafalgar Square. I can't imagine a more convenient location for someone on holiday in London."
64,1268,"Sep 20 2004	Fine - location is great	The hotel is okay, the decor tired and rooms not spacious. But the staff were pleasant and the location is brillant."
65,1268,"Aug 19 2004	National Gallery next door!	For art lovers and sightseers, this is a great location. It is steps away from the incredible National Gallery and very conveniently located to multiple tube stops. Downside: the room was VERY small (we required a room with two beds. They were twin size and mattresses were uncomfortable. However, rooms with one queen bed are much more spacious). But with a hearty full English breakfast included in the very reasonable price I booked, it made up for the discomfort. Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square and many theatres are seconds away by foot. Note: if you're debating between the two, the Thistle Piccadilly is only about 100 yards away from the Thistle Trafalgar Square location."
