203,1778,"May 1 2007 	Perfect location - great for the price!	I was a bit worried about how the hotel would be but im glad i listened to all the positive reviews. It was absolutely fine! For one of the cheaper hotels in NY, we felt it had everything we needed and the location was perfect for seeing everything and a few minutes walk to the restaurants/shows in Times Square. Our Queen room on the 2nd floor was clean and spacious, with tea/coffee facilities, iron, hairdryer, and a good size bathroom. Air conditioning was a bit loud but it worked! Having free breakfast (if we wanted it) and free internet access was great! And the reception staff were very helpful and friendly (and happy to change peoples rooms if they wanted to). Couldnt really fault the place! Would definitely reccommend!"
204,1778,"Apr 25 2007	Big for a NY hotel room!	Fantastic location - just blocks from Broadway shows, Times Square. Quite reasonable for the location. Room was clean and larger than most NY hotel rooms. I will definitely stay here again!"
205,1778,"Apr 25 2007 	Budget hotel good location near Times Square	A block off Times Square, this is a great location for theatre goers. Plenty going on in the neighborhood. Lobby was not bad, with breakfast area, free internet and printer, exercise room. As a business traveler I was given a small bag with generous sample sizes of toiletries and snacks. Rooms were New York city small, with a small closet although a decent sized bathroom. Room had coffee maker, clock radio, and a TV that needed some adjustment. The air conditioning is supplied by a room unit that can be noisy for some, but the outflow was blocked by the drapes which were tricky to close. The staff were friendly, knowledgable. Reports of noise in other reviews did not materialize except for some door slamming. With prices sky high in Manhattan the Comfort Inn offers a reasonably priced stay although in other cities $250 would get you five star accommodations."
206,1778,"Apr 24 2007 	Great Location; Clean Hotel	I won't repeat what others have said about this hotel, but I highly recommend it for anyone who would like to stay near Times Square. It is a short 5 min walk from the closest subway station (both the Times Square one and the 42nd blue line which is a straight connect to the AirTrain Jamaica station). Although not a glamourous hotel, it met our basic needs. Clean room, clean bathroom, and a free continental breakfast. Really, you don't need much more when you're mostly wandering in NYC.Definitely will come back to this hotel the next time we visit NYC."
207,1778,"Apr 12 2007 	Really Enjoyed My Stay!	I just came back from a very nice experience at the Comfort Inn Midtown. I stayed in a standard room with a queen-size bed and had plenty of room. The room, bathroom, bed linens, et al were very clean. I was on the fourth floor in the front of the hotel, so I could hear some street noise at night, but it wasn't excessive and it didn't keep me awake.The location was FABULOUS...if you love Broadway shows, it's the best. It was right down the street from the TKTS stand and within easy walking distance of the shows.Best of all was the attitude of the staff. The check-in staff was friendly, there was a gentleman who was wonderful about little courtesies like opening the elevator when he saw you coming, and the desk staff was nice about answering questions, giving directions, etc. I loved being able to check my e-mail, and the continental breakfast in the morning was a simple but tasty way to start the day.This is a budget hotel, but I found the overall quality, services, and friendliness to be much better than other budget places where I've stayed. The Comfort Inn Midtown enhanced my trip to Manhattan, and I'll be back!"
208,1778,"Apr 11 2007	Review from Ireland	My wife and I stayed here for four nights in March 2007 and had a most pleasant experience. We have stayed in many Comfort Inns across the States and although the rooms here are smaller the double room we got was perfectly adequate, bed was comfortable and everything was spotless. Nice touch is the goody bag on arrival. Staff most pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was excellent with a good choice and plentiful. Also very nice clientelle. Approximately 100 yds. from Times Square-you won't get better location. Also felt very safe although could say this for anywhere we visited. For a nice drink Rosie O'Gradys is two doors away and open late. It's friendly and accommodating. O'Briens across the road is much smaller, wasn't to our taste and the drink prices were steep by comparison with most bars we visited. O'Flahertys on East 46th. Street is more of an old style bar, has music every night and is worth a visit if you don't mind a bit of a walk. For good food at reasonable prices, lunch specials and very reasonable drink prices (pint of Bud for $3) try McAnnas to the left as you exit the hotel- about two blocks. Excellent fish and chips for $7.95. We absolutely loved New York and and can't wait to visit again. Would have no hesitation in staying at the Comfort again and would recommend to anyone in particular first time visitors."
209,1778,"Mar 23 2007 	Awsome Location	This is seriously THE BEST location that money can buy in Midtown Manhattan. We paid around $170 per night for the hotel. They also will give you a AAA discount (10% off). The Comfort Inn Midtown is less than 1/2 block from the center of Times Square. Granted, it's not a luxury hotel, but it is a clean, decent place to sleep at night. And besides, that's what a hotel is for anyways. You don't spend that much time there. The room was small, as is expected for NY. The bed is decent. There was no view, but this is also expected since Manhattan is full of skyscrapers to block the views. The plus is that there's free continental breakfast in the morning and free internet. The front desk staff was very curtious and polite. The 1/2 price ticket booth (for musicals and plays) is 1/2 block away. The hotel is also about 1 block from 5th Avenue (with all the famous shopping). Manhattan has a great subway system. The subway stop is less than 1 block away from the hotel. It's within walking distance to most of the theaters, Rockefeller Center, Macy's, We saw Doubt (a play) and it was excellent. We took the subway everywhere and saw just about everything there was to see in Manhattan."
210,1778,"Mar 21 2007 	I Suggest You Reconsider	Myself and my three friends decided to go for four nights and five days to New York City for spring break. As University students, we don't exactly have a lot of cash to spend on accomodations or transportation, so we decided to stay somewhere affordable and close to Times Square. Those two aspects of this hotel is pretty much where the positives end.I may be a little bit biased as I am used to travelling with my family, and we tend to stay at luxury hotels when we go away. However, I have stayed with friends at Comfort Inns before, several times actually, and I have never been as unpleasantly surprised as I was with this particular one. The room was small. When I say it was small, I mean small even by New York City standards. The two double beds were practically touching and I couldn't even pull my suitcase from one side of the room to the other. The bathroom was a tub and a sink, and it was freezing cold. The heater was a very noisy window unit and the temperature did not stay consistent.The main hallway was nice, but it is decieving. We stayed on the fourth floor, and the rooms were so close to each other that we could hear everything that was going on in the room next to us VERY clearly. On the last two nights that we were there there was a couple across the hall that seemed to be filming rather innapropriate amateur movies quite unabashadly, and with the door to their room wide open. We called the front desk, but no one did anything and the nonsense went on until about 3AM, when they finally shut their door.Room service was fine. The pillows were quite lumpy, the beds were hard and the sheets were clean, but very old and faded. We didn't have any problems with our maid service. Due to our familiarity with luxury hotels, we often lef cash sitting on the desk and bedside tables by accident, but it was always there when we returned at night.Breakfast was wonderful. it was actually oddly out of place in the otherwise budget hotel. There was fresh coffee, a cappuccino machine, bagels, muffins, several types of cereal, waffles, a toaster and fresh fruit. They also provided Red Bull free of charge every morning, which I found quite nice. I'm not a breakfast eater, but I did find myself waking up specifically so I could go down for some in the mornings.I probably would have returned to stay if I hadn't been so insulted by the manager when we checked out. The staff had, up until this point been very very friendly. The breakfast attendant did not speak any english, but he was always smiling, the maids were friendly and very accomodating, the front desk attendant was very nice and I had a good chat with him almost every night. However, the manager, a woman whose name I can't remember, was very rude. When we were checking out we noticed that there was a long distance phone call on our bill for $10. We looked up the area code and it was a call to Quebec. None of us had made a phonecall from the room, we all used our cell phones. At one point we tried to order pizza, but couldn't even get the room phone to work. Despite our best efforts, we couldn't even get the manager to care or check into it. She just kept shrugging it off and telling us we had to pay. I mean, it was only $10. We insisted on talking to someone else, but she told us there simply was no one else, and then announced that she had to go home as her shift was over.If you want something cheap and in a good location and you don't mind cramped rooms, loud noises and pornographers, you should be fine. I recommend the breakfast."
211,1778,"Mar 17 2007 	Great value for NYC	I will be eternally grateful to the Comfort Inn Midtown for rescuing us from the horror of the Murray Hill Inn (where we had originally booked for five nights but left after two for various reasons - refer my review for that hotel).So, maybe I was wearing rose-coloured glasses but the CIM seemed like an oasis to us! Less than one minute's walk from Times Square, and just a couple of blocks from Fifth Avenue, the location is fantastic. The complimentary breakfast is basic but fresh (bagels, juice, tea/coffee/red bull, yoghurt, cereals), and it's great to have free access to the internet. The staff on the front desk take some prompting to get their attention.Our room was very spacious by NYC standards also with a large bathroom including a bath. All very clean and tidy. The lift is small, slow and there's just one, but better than none at all. (Murray Hill Inn take note.)Highly recommended!"
212,1778,"Mar 11 2007	Great Place to Stay!	A friend and I booked this hotel pretty last minute. We had searched for a few days to find a hotel that had a good price, a good location, and 2 double beds (most things you book online, you can't request this). I chanced upon this one, and am so glad!It's close enough to Broadway / Times Square that you can walk to all the shows, yet in enough off 6th Ave to be quiet at night. We (Two twenty-something women) felt very safe walking in the area, and to and from the hotel at night. It is also close to the subway, which we also used (though forgot a few times to watch for uptown/downtown direction...whoops!).The hotel was great. All staff were friendly and helpful, and check-in and out was done in a matter of minutes. I called the hotel directly to book and received the exact room I wanted. I then was able to recieve a 10% discount by presenting my AAA card upon arrival. This made it cheaper than anything we found online.  We stayed in room 608--request it if you are also looking for a 2 double bed room. The closet was on the small side, but we had no trouble with having enough space for the 2 of us. People complained in other reviews about having a room in the back, with a view of a building, but honestly, it was fine--we heard no noise outside! Even if you had a room at the front of the hotel, you'd only see the building across the street, and it would probably be noisy at night! You could hear people opening/closing doors in our section of the hall (7 or 8 rooms) but not so much that we were disturbed during the night.I guess if there were more than 2 people there, things could be a little tight, but it's doable. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The free breakfast was great (from 7 to 10 am), bagels, cereal, coffee, juice, yogurt, toast--helped us save a few bucks. The elevator is small, so you might have to wait to go up, but really, who cares? There are two computers, which were handy for checking show prices &amp; mapping places we wanted to go. You might have to wait a few minutes if other guests are there, but no big deal. Hallways are narrow, as they are in many hotels. Really, it was a very decent hotel for a fabulous price. We are highly recommending it to friends and family in the future...Just a side note, if you are going to a broadway show &amp; want cheap tickets: Many shows have last minute ticket lotteries a few hours ahead of show time. These tickets are under $30 each and are usually for the front row. You can hope your name is pulled and get 2 tix per name. However, lotteries are open for up to 30 min...and people come from nowhere to put their name in! Other shows have &quot;rush&quot; tickets where the first 30 or so people in line can get up to 2 tix per person. The Disney ones specify that these are for students, but others (Color Purple, Chicago, etc.) are just first come, first served; each person in line gets 2 tix. Just do a round of the ticket offices for shows you want to see; ask them what time to get there for lotteries/RUSH tix and try that first!WORTH IT TO CHECK OUT BEFORE GOING TO TKTS (which cost 60 - 100 dollars (though maybe better seats)."
213,1778,"Feb 20 2007 	Comfort inn review	Me and my family stayed here for 5 nights in a 2 double bedded room. The room was clean and fresh towels provided everyday. The room was fairly small for 4 people but was more than sufficient considering it was only used as a base. The bathroom was fairly cold but you only use it for a short time so no real problem once the shower was used. The breakfast was more than adequate with a selection of bagels, pastries, yogurts, cereal, fruit e.t.cThe location is great and if you want a drink in the evening there was a bar (rosie o'grady) just along the road that had no problem with our 2 sons being allowed in (ages 16 and 13)So all in all a decent room for the fairly inexpensive rate and i would use them again if I ever returned to NYC"
214,1778,"Feb 2 2007	Good experience nice people	Well, It was my first time not only in New York but in the USA and I have to say that the location of the hotel is great. Me and my boyfriend had a nice experience in this place; Its clean and the employees were really kind. We didnt had a room with a nice view, but a very quiet room (except by the heater, seems little old) We were little concerned about security, but nothing happened at the end. Basic breakfast its like that: basic, and its served in a small saloon, anyway it was clean and enough to start our walks throw New York. If I have to repeat, I will do it without doubts. The price related to the quality of the place its more than fair."
215,1778,"Jan 22 2007 	Loud Loud 	I stayed 3 nights at this hotel which was in a wonderful location and reasonably priced. I would never stay there again because of the noise though. The room doors are heavy and close loud and hard. I tried to respect my neighbors, but they didn't do the same for me. I was awakened constantly during the night. I stayed up until 12:30 a.m., but others around me were up later and every time someone closed their door it woke me up and shook the room. The noise would start up again around 6:30 a.m. as people left their rooms. I have never heard hotel room doors close so loudly. Waking up constantly because of this ruined this hotel for me. There were other negatives such as the room phone that worked the first day, but not the other two days. The weather was very cold while I was there, and at night I about froze in the bed. The blankets were tissue thin. I slept with a sweater over my pajamas. Unless I couldn't find it, I don't think there was any way to control the heat in the room. There was a window air conditioner, but for heat I was at the hotel's mercy. The room seemed clean until I pulled the bedsheets back at midnight on the first night and saw a semen stain. Despite all of this, I have to admit that the location was terrific and the staff that I encountered were delightful. They were all pleasant and very friendly. The bathroom was large and the water pressure great with plenty of hot water. I really liked the people that worked there, but I just wouldn't go back primarily because of the loud room doors."
216,1778,"Jan 22 2007 	Safe Clean and Convenient!!	My 9 year old daughter and I stayed here for 4 days last week. I was a little concerned about safety, but my mind was put at ease by the other reviews. The staff was so nice to us and really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We were even given a &quot;goody bag&quot; upon arrival, which was the coolest thing for my daughter! Our room was on the small side, but was large enough for 2 twin beds, a desk, entertainment center and our luggage. The bathroom was clean and even had a hair dryer, coffee maker and window shelf for all of things. The BEST thing about this hotel is the location. You are literally steps away from Times Square! We walked everywhere (Today Show, shopping on Fifth Ave. and all Broadway shows). For the price, you can not go wrong here. If you are going to New York to sit in a big expensive hotel room, then you are going for the wrong reasons!! We will stay at this location on all of our future trips and will highly recommend it to our family and friends."
217,1778,"Jan 9 2007 	Location Location.....	As so many of the reviews here will tell you, this hotel benefits from a superb location, just off Times Square in NYC. Literally steps away from the action and inside the New Year celebrations police cordon when we stayed there in 2006/7.Accomodation is, unfortunately, a little less glamorous. Think tired Travelodge and you'll have the idea. Our room was small (about 11 feet square) with a view of the next building. You could just about see the sky if you peered up between the buildings. Our room on the 3rd floor was quiet, even on New Years Eve, an important plus for a city centre hotel!Despite it's slightly tired appearance, the hotel had a good continental breakfast included and the desk staff were helpful and polite. Add that to complimentary gym and internet access (2 PCs) and you have a good budget package, considering the location.In short, don't expect too much and you won't be dissapointed."
218,1778,"Dec 19 2006 	You will enjoy value and location.	Four of us went to Manhattan in Dec of 2006. I checked Trip Advisor for reviews, and the ratings given were very reliable. The location of this hotel is perfect for Time Square area. The room was not overly small considering size of most NYC rooms. I felt that it was more than adequate for 2 people. Hotel Staff very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and comfortable. We had a room on the 7th floor front view. The other couple with us had a side room. Both rooms OK, but I believe the room with the front view had a little more room than the side room. Only one elevator in hotel, but it really was not a major problem. Breakfast room a little small, but my advice is don't be in a hurry, give yourself enough time, wait your turn for a seat and you will enjoy a typical continental breakfast for free. I have been in many hotels in NYC including Hilton New York, Rennaissance Time Square, Millenium Broadway, and rate this hotel as one I would definetely stay at again, because of value pricing."
219,1778,"Dec 10 2006 	Our Camera was stolen - Management Unresponsive	Based on the price we knew this would not be a luxury hotel but was just looking for something clean and safe. The room was very basic but clean. The day after we checked in my camera was stolen out of my suit case and my daughters coat pockets were gone through as well. We reported this to the manager who indicated our maid was only employed with them one week. The manager did not follow up with us as promised. We spoke with another occupant who had 2 cameras stolen from their room the same day. When they asked the hotel if any other cameras had been reported missing they were told no, which was not true. We were not advised to fill out an incident report and were discouraged from contacting the police. So for the rest of our stay we had no maid service because of concern about additional items being stolen. There is 1 ice machine and it was broken half the time we were there. Several of the hotel employees were very friendly and nice, unfortunately the theft and lack of candor and appropriate followup with the management really tainted our stay. I would not recommend staying here. The cost savings with this hotel will be spent to replace my camera that was stolen out of my suitcase."
220,1778,"Nov 26 2006 	More Than Just A Hotel	LOCATION! LOCATION! LOCATION! This is so important, but when it is coupled with great staff and excellent cleanliness it means so much more. Good continental selectional for breakfast. Our room on the 3rd floor faced a brick wall but we just kept the shades drawn , no problem as we were out all day!!Only 2 doors away from Rosie O Gradys, good food and craic (oh, by the way thats Irish for great conversation and laughter) Forgot to mention on arrival you get a welcome bag per person with lots of little goodies included, how many hotels do this??. If you book tickets for the Greyline bus at reception you get $3 off per person Will definately stay here again!!"
221,1778,Nov 15 2006 	Excellent location clean very comfortable professional staff	I have stayed at this hotel twice in the last 2 months. Five nights in October and four nights in November and was very impressed with this hotel. It is in a great location (steps to Times Square) and the staff are very helpful and friendly. The beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is excellent. The price and location are difficult to beat. The rooms are very clean. The staff also bend over backwards to arrange shuttles to the airport and to provide tourist information. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to NYC.
222,1778,"Nov 13 2006 	Nice simple friendly hotel with a great location	My wife and I stayed here for one night while we were in New York to see some shows. While we didn't have to pay full price for our room due to points earned on a credit card affinity program, we would nonetheless definetely consider staying here next time we're in New York City. This hotel isn't fancy, certainly, but it has everything you would want for a comfortable stay. The front desk staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful for an establishment of this sort. The room is small, and a &quot;real&quot; window with a view of something beside the ventilation shaft would have been nice, but everything was extremely clean and well maintained. The bathroom was large and well-supplied. The television set, air conditioning, coffee maker, and clock radio worked fine, and seemed quite new. Indeed, the whole room seems to have been updated and refurbished faily recently. There was even an extra pillow for both of us! There was a nice complimentary continental breakfast, and an excercise room and internet room (which we did not use). For a hotel at this level, you really couldn't expect more. A great location as well; I couldn't believe how close Times Square was! The $23 special rate for overnight parking (in a very modern garage across the street) was quite reasonablr, as well, for New York (about half what it would have cost otherwise)."
223,1778,"Nov 11 2006 	A Handy place for a visiting Manhatten	I really liked the place, abit dated in decor but it feels warm and doesnt have the sterile feel like alot of chain hotels have.The room service was good with comfy beds. Be warned of the Receptionist though, He's an anglophile - and loves all things British, constant refrences to the BBC's &quot;keeping up apperences&quot; made me laugh..... i would recommend this hotel."
224,1778,"Nov 2 2006 	Excellent location	We just returned from a five night stay at this hotel and while I was a little concerned whether it would be too basic, how wrong I was, yeah it is in need of some painting and modernisation but for that price and location you can;t go wrong. The staff were sooo nice and helpful, breakfast was plentiful, room was clean as was bathroom and of a fair size, the only concern I had was I overheard a few other guests complaining about the radiators in their room being noisy, we had no such problems thankfully. But what do you want for that price? Would stay again definitely if on a budget."
225,1778,Oct 29 2006 	Good Value and Great Location	We stayed at the Hotel from the 21st Oct to 26th we were on the 6th floor and had no problems with the lift. The rooms were clean the staff helpfull and what a great location only a few yards from Times Square and lots of bars and restaurants to choose from. I would certainly stay there again and cant wait to return to NY.
226,1778,"Oct 27 2006	What a location!	This hotel was simple. It provided an excellent location for sightseeing, just a few paces from Times Square.The room was small, and don't expect a view. But if all you want is a clean, safe place to sleep at night, it is an excellent choice for the budget-concious traveller.The breakfast was well-stocked, with the usual selection of cereal, fruit, bread and bagels, pastries and donughts, juice, tea and coffee. Free copies of USA Today and the NY Post were available by 7am every morning.The staff were friendly and helpful without being &quot;over the top&quot;.A great place to stay in a great location. Book it with confidence."
227,1778,"Oct 25 2006 	Great Location Excellent Value	We stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown from 21st-25th September this year. The location of the hotel is superb being only 1/2 a block from Times Square. Our room was on the 7th floor and was quite bright. The room was larger than I expected and both the room and the bathroom were spotless. There were coffee making facilities which were replenished daily and an ironing board and iron in the room. All of the staff I had dealings with were polite and friendly. The free buffet breakfast consisted of bagels, toast, pastries, doughnuts, cereal, fruit, coffee and juice, all of which was replenished constantly. There is a complimentary fitness room with 3 cardio machines and a business room with 2 computers which offer free internet and printing. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would be very happy to stay here again.Footnote: Rosie O'Grady's Steak house a couple of doors down serve excellent food in a nice atmosphere, and O'Briens Irish Bar across the road is a great place for pre dinner drinks or for a night cap - very friendly!"
228,1778,"Oct 21 2006 	So close to Times Square A must stay at!!!	This is a nice place and i would stay there again for sure, the elevator is broken alot and as long as you ask for a room on the highest floors available you will be able to see past the comfort inn sign they have on the from of the building!!!! also, ask for a room on the front of the hotel not the back, the back looks out onnto a alley and tltho not bad, its not fun to look out to a brick wall when you are in the CITY!!!! all the rooms on the front tho are one bed so our boys slept on the CLEAN NIC KEPT FLOOR!!! the hotel even offered us free extra blankets and pillows for us!!!! along with the room is a clean bath bigger then i planned on being in the city and all and the room was basic but great great location only 1/2 block from times square!!! check in is not overly friendly but you dont pay for that since the prices are pretty low for you where you are staying!!!!"
229,1778,"Oct 17 2006 	Highly recommend this hotel!	Myself, my mother and my sister stayed in this hotel for 5 nights while on a shopping trip. It is in an excellent location and terrific value for money. Everything is within walking distance, broadway, 5th Av, Macys, Port Authority etc... Breakfast was included in the price which included bagels, cereal, pastries etc.. and the guy looking after the breakfast was great and don't forget to tip him! There was free computer and internet access...very handy. The room and ensuite were clean and tidy, and cleaned every day!!! Great choice for a trip to NY, have stayed in other hotels on other trips and none of them come close....will definitely be back!"
230,1778,"Oct 5 2006 	Great Value	New York City: Comfort Inn MidtownDate: Sept. 26 - 30, 2006Reviewer: Trip Advisor Member, Burlington,CanadaThis hotel provides very good value for the money. The room was $162 per night. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was plenty large enough for 2 people. We did not spend a lot of time in the room. Most of our waking hours were spent sight seeing. The room was very clean. The only drawback was that the room faced 46th street and thus was quite noisey. My wife and I are fairly sound sleepers so this did not really bother us that much. Other rooms may be much quieter. The breakfast provided was typical of many hotels. We ate shotly after the breakfast room opened (7:00 am) and found everything satisfactory. The breakfast was as advertised. There was only on small elevator. We did not experience any long waits. We were on the 3rd floor and often walked down the stairs. The location is great. There are many restaurants nearby. Times Square is less than a block away. You can walk to many attractions such as Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Center, many theaters, Times Square and the bus tours (hop on/ hop off).This is a great place to stay. We would stay here again."
231,1778,"Oct 2 2006	Great Location for a room with no view :)	We stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown for 5 nights 9/26-10/1. We stayed here because we were on a budget and it was $179/night and the best we could find in the location. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel for the price. The hotel staff were very friendly. The continental breakfast was nice as well as the business center where we were able to check our emails and print our boarding passes for NO CHARGE! The room was pretty small but we were only there long enough to sleep so that didnt bother me. I also requsted a room away from the street so we didnt have any problems with noise. I did hear the slamming doors once in awhile but not enough to disrupt my sleep. Luckily we were on the 2nd floor, so we used the stairs the whole time. I did notice the elevator was very slow so I am glad we were on the 2nd floor. Overall, it was a fine hotel for the price and I would definitely stay here again. The location is excellent and you are close to subway stops."
232,1778,"Sep 26 2006	Value for money	We were staying in Comfort Inn Midtown, New York 4 nights before we went on a cruise. The hotel considering the price was above average, situated in the heart of Manhatten, the service in top, very friendly and I could go on praising the hotel. The only negative experience was the noise from the street, why I advice the owners to install windows with double glaser ."
233,1778,"Sep 17 2006 	I agree this is a very good option	Hi! When I was planning my first-ever trip to New York City I really did not know where to stay and I admit the reviews that I read in Trip Advisor where the key element in order to choose the Comfort Inn Midtown. After a four-night stay my conclusion is that I agree to previous reviews in the sense that this hotel is a very good option in New York City.I do not have new things to add to the many reviews posted here, but I would like to comment my agreement on the following advantages of the Comfort Inn Midtown:Price.- Very affordable considering the hotel is closely located to Times Square.Room/bathroom cleanliness.- They were spotless in my experience.Room amenities.- No luxuries here but you find adequate space for clothes (corner closet), iron, ironing board, hairdryer, coffee maker, radio alarm &amp; TV. Hotel amenities.- I found the free Internet access (two computers in a business room), complimentary breakfast, and free daily newspaper as a plus. There is also a fitness room but I did not use it; it seemed small but adequate.Location.- As it has been repeatedly noted, the hotel is close to Times Square and the Rockefeller subway station; the convenient location gives you the chance to walk and be part of many activities or to take the subway or a bus wherever you want to go.Staff.- In my experience, the maid and the breakfast room attendant were even friendlier than the front desk staff, but in general terms all of the employees are kind and attentive.On the other hand, some travelers have noticed weaknesses and noted them here; I have an opinion on the following:Slamming doors.- Yes, doors do slam, then it is a good idea to be careful when closing them.Elevator.- It is old and small indeed but no big deal; my room was in the sixth floor so I usually took the elevator and its service was functional enough.Room size.- I do not know other New York hotels room size, thus I lack a point of comparison; the room seemed small (I got a queen-size bed) but I do not need more space. Perhaps the rooms are too small if you travel with your family, but I did not have the chance to see a two-bed room to have an opinion on that.Temperature.- Other reviews complained of rooms being too hot no problem in my stay, since tropical storm Ernesto brought rainy days to the city.As a side note, throughout the almost 250 TripAdvisor Traveler Reviews about the Comfort Inn Midtown, there are some descriptions that are actually referring to the Comfort Inn Manhattan, which is located in 35th St and has a total of 12 floors; the Comfort Inn Midtown is a smaller hotel, with a total of 9 floors (new readers of these reviews, please take this into account any descriptions of a 12-floor hotel and two elevators are actually not referring to the Comfort Inn Midtown).Overall, I would stay in this hotel again."
234,1778,"Sep 9 2006	Good location Gruff but later helpful staff Great value	I booked a night here based on the reviews here. This one really rose to the top as the best hotel under $200/night.I wanted a clean room for a night after a red-eye and didn't want to pay the $300/night that most name brand hotels were charging.Upon arrival, they weren't able to give us a room. Understandable since it was 8am. We returned after breakfast at a local diner and were again told that we couldn't get a room until 12 or 1. This is better than the standard 3-4 pm check in times, but we figured that they'd have an early check out and be able to get us in sometime sooner.We ended up killing a little time in the lobby and our patience paid off. Probably 15 minutes after 9, they were able to get us a clean room that more than met our expectations. Sure the room was small, but not unreasonably small. I'd say comparable to rooms in San Francisco or Europe. I'd stay there again and definitely feel it's worth the $100 in savings."
235,1778,"Sep 7 2006	Great Hotel for a NYC Trip!!	My wife and I stayed at the hotel on September 3, 2006. Yes, the rooms are small, but when you are in NYC how much time do you actually stay in the room? The bathroom was small as well, but again, how much room do you really need in the bathroom. Both the room, bathroom, and lobby were CLEAN. The air conditioner was a window unit that provided adequate cooling power (we like our room cool). Room ammenities included: iron and ironing board, hairdryer, and coffee pot.The location is great because it is between time square and 6th avenue.The only suggestion I would make for a person who is staying at this hotel, is to call the hotel and ask if there are any festivals going on that would block the street. We happened to be arriving during Brazil day, and could not access the street by car which required us to park 7 blocks away instead of the parking garage across the street from the hotel.OVERALL: We would def. stay in this hotel again!"
236,1778,"Aug 23 2006	Great hotel and great location	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown in the middle of July. We had read the reviews posted here and were fairly certain it would be a nice place. Turns out everyone was right! The Comfort Inn is located 1/2 a block from Times Square so the location couldn't be any better. We were right in the middle of the action! Being in the middle of all this you'd expect a lot of noise but our room was perfectly quiet - slamming doors were a little loud as some had mentioned before but not enough to wake us up. The room was small but that was fine with us because who wants to spend a lot of time in the hotel anyway... The room was also very clean and the staff was always extremely nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to experience NY! Also, there's a subway station pretty close so getting around the city is no problem."
237,1778,"Aug 15 2006 	Clean with a great location	This hotel was better than expected. It was close to Times Square (1/2 a block away) and close to grand central station (3 blocks). The most important thing was that the rooms were clean. The bathroom was clean too! I know that other reviews said something about church bells, but we were right next to the church and didn't hear the bells. The only noisy thing was our child neighbor screaming at 11pm and then slamming the door to her room about 10 times. This is of course nothing that the hotel could have controlled. It was very convient to have free internet access (two computers) in the lobby. The free breakfast was also very nice. My fiance even used their fitness room which was very small but had a bike, treadmill, and stairmaster. The best part of this hotel was the unbeatable price of $110 per night! I would stay here again and reccommend it to my friends!Oh and we also stopped in Havanna central (right on 46th street a couple doors away from the hotel) for dinner and it was fantasitic especially the mojitos!"
238,1778,"Aug 14 2006 	building work!	Nice hotel, at this price. First room offered was a single (that claimed to be a double). I could not see two 200lb people getiing into the bed. They changed our room for a better one. Main problem was the buiding work going on inside the hotel. They had completed the restyling of first four or five floors, but the work was still going on as we could see every day. Men carrying plaster board in the lifts and old units out meaning that only one of the two lifts was available most of the time. Place was dusty desoite the constant effort of the staff. Should be OK soon, I hope,"
239,1778,"Jul 12 2006	Better than expected	We stayed here from June 10-17, 2006. We had booked a room with a King bed and sofabed in November 2005. Due to the other comments on this site I rang the day I was checking in to be told byu the hotel they do not have king size beds with a sofabed in the same room. This made for a very uncomfortable stay for my husband, our eight year old and me in one bed. My brother-in-law slept in the other bed. We have not yet had an apology from the hotel, although we booked through Choice Hotels. Anyway, we had a room on the twelth floor and had fantastic views of both the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. We walked the stairs most of the time, and it was great to walk the various staircases and to see the old building, including watching the mail go down the chute. Our room was always clean. The breakfast was very good each morning and the location was great for subways and walking.I would stay here again, but you need to ensure you are getting what you pay for."
240,1778,"Jun 28 2006	I agree heartily - this is a great Location!!!	I have just spent 7 nights at the Comfort Inn Midtown, New York City. I would agree that the location is one of the main selling points of this establishment. The Inn is situated a mere couple of minutes walk from Times Square and there are lots of local eateries (at various food prices and choices.) As well, it is close to the Hop On - Hop Off buses at Times Square and within walking distance to many of New York's vast sights and subway stations. The room my husband and I were allocated was very small, as was the bathroom (shower stall/toilet/washbasin). The room was clean - but do NOT expect 5 star accommodation. I rate this hotel as 2 1/2 to 3 stars. However, the hotel staff were very friendly and obliging. The room price included breakfast which was sufficient to start the day's activities (tea/coffee/juice + cereals/pastries etc/fruits). We enjoyed a great live theatre matinee show after waiting a relaltive short time for TDKT tickets (2 for the price of 1 !) The ticket selling booth was located closeby Times Square. Value for money, I think this was a most favourable hotel and we have stayed in this city 5 or 6 times previously. P.S. We showed our Australian Automobile Club Membership Card and got 10% off the daily rate. I booked the hotel over the web at hotels-and-discounts.com"
241,1778,"Jun 26 2006	good spot for a night or two	I stayed at this midtown location, on west 36th streeet, on june 9th. The location was pretty good, about a 5-10 minute walk to the subway. The cab ride home from the theater was $5 or$6. Our room was very small, with a single and a double bed, small armoire, desk and a standard comfort inn bathroom. It was all really clean, and the breakfast was better than expected. They served a few kinds of juice, coffee, cereals, toast, bagels, and fruit(apples, bananas, oranges).The staff was hard working and generally pleasant. I paid $179, for a thursday night, which seemed like a decent value, considering new york hotel prices!"
242,1778,"Jun 19 2006	Rooms are tiny hotel is clean staff are friendly	I turned to Trip Advisor for a weekend stay in November 2005 at the Comfort Inn. For what it's worth, here's my experience. The lobby is nicely lit, lots of shiny brass, and it's clean. The elevator up to the sixth floor was tight, the smallest I've ever ridden. It was a taste of things to come. The bed's headboard was two feet to the right of the doorway. A desk lay six feet straight ahead, then the wall. Walking in anywhere in the room meant circling the bed. But the place was clean, including the small bathroom with shower (no tub). There was ample closet space. I'd guess the room was 10' by 10' (3m x 3m).For November, which was bitterly cold, the room was quite warm. Too warm in fact; we left our window open during the day, as there's no thermostat (the whole hotel is heated to same temp. all winter, per agreement with utility company, front desk said.) Not a biig problem. The room was set back from the street and quiet enough. My sister-in-law, her husband and their 1-year-old shared a room next to us. It was about 1/3 bigger for the same price. The hotel's biggest asset is its location. You can't get much closer to Times Square. If you're a budget tourist, this is the place to stay. The continental breakfast was fine -- cereal, milk, coffee and donuts. (My Aussie in-laws thought this was a hoot, as no one in Australia eats donuts for *breakfast.* They'd only heard of such a thing on &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;) An attendant lingered in the breakfast room, making sure we had ample milk, coffee etc. He works on tips -- a buck is appreciated.Overall, I'd stay here again if I was on a budget. It's not luxurious. But it's modern and it's clean and it's in Times Square. If you don't plan on spending much time in your room, you'll be fine."
243,1778,"Jun 14 2006	Clean Comfortable Friendly Staff	Read all reviews before staying at this hotel. Was still reluctant because the room rate was so reasonable. We stayed for three nights. Would I return? Yes I would. The room was clean, small (it's New York!), location was great, breakfast was more than adequate, and the staff is very friendly. Thank you Comfort Inn for making our stay enjoyable."
244,1778,Jun 14 2006	Location location location	We loved this place! It's small and nothing fancy but what do you expect for the price? No view from the windows but within less than 100 steps out the front door you're in the center of Times Square! The air condtioner was loud which was nice bc we heard no one else around. So glad we found this place. We will ablsolutely be back!!!
245,1778,"Jun 13 2006	Avoid if you are a light sleeper...	Just came back from a long week-end in NYC. I agree with everybody. Almost everything was perfect about this hotel (location, cleanliness, friendly staff, small but workable room, decent breakfast, storage room). We got there at lunch time and our room was ready. Perfect! The only, but very important, problem is that I could hardly sleep in our room. The cause: the rooms are not soundproofed at all. We could hear the TV and the children speak in the room next to ours and everything that was going on in the hallway (a family was sharing multiple rooms and was constantly going from one room to the others, screaming, laughing and slamming doors; it was awful). In addition, its New York City; people were coming in and out at all hours, slamming doors and screaming in the small hallway. I had problems falling asleep because of all the noise and was constantly waken up afterwards. In the middle of the night, after 3 or 4, I was finally able to sleep. If you are like me a light sleeper, you better select another hotel. Since we are more experienced with the subway system now, next time we plan to stay away from Times Square. For about the same price, we will get a much better hotel. We may even be ready to pay a bit more to get a good night sleep."
246,1778,"Jun 6 2006	Would definitely stay there again	Just returned from staying at the Comfort Inn Midtown for 5 nights. Total price per night including taxes was $200. We usually stay at 3 or 4 star hotels but tried out a 2-star for a change (and price was much better). The hotel was small (in size and number of rooms) which was nice for a change. The elevator was big enough for about 8 people (or 3 with luggage). Warning - watch out for the elevator door! It slams FAST and HARD and I still have the bruise on my hand to prove it. The halls were very narrow. Our room was the smallest I have ever stayed in but was adequate. I called it a &quot;one-way room&quot; because only one person could walk around at a time! The window air conditioner was great and not loud at all - just a quiet hum. We were on the back facing the church next door and heard the church bells a lot which was nice. Actually, that was the only noise we heard the whole trip from our room. The bathroom was larger than I had expected. It even had a large frosted window in it and a large ledge to sit your stuff on. We only had the breakfast 2 mornings and it was fine - bagels, toast, boiled eggs, cereal, donuts, fruit, coffee, orange and apple juice, cappucino, coffee and tea. One person said there were only 4 tables in there, but there were 8 (I think). We did have to wait a couple of minutes one day. I think it would have been nice if the people who were finished would have left and given up their table instead of sitting there planning the day's itinerary while we stood there. The computer room (2 computers, free internet) was a nice plus because we could check on a few things while we were there. All the employees were friendly. One other thing - the doors really do SLAM when you leave your room. They usually started around 7 a.m. All you have to do is keep your hand on the handle and pull it shut and it won't slam. We couldn't figure out why people let them slam so much. Rude, I guess. Anyway, bottom line is this hotel was great for the money and location, I would highly recommend it if you wanted a nice place to sleep and shower, and we would definitely stay there again."
247,1778,"Jun 6 2006	excellent location excellent value	this is a small friendly hotel in a great location and offering excellent value for money, with breakfast included!. We would have no hesitation recommending it to friends and family.One small niggle was the fact that the double glazing did not have an airtight seal and therefore lets through more road noise that it should."
248,1778,"Jun 1 2006	A very nice hotel in the midst of Times Square	What a gem! We had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel. Given its Times Square location and its relatively inexpensive price, I was a bit apprehensive about what we would get. Our room, however, much surpassed our expectations. Although small, it was nicely furnished and the bathroom was clean and relatively spacious. In fact, the hotel looks as if it was recently refurbished. The entire staff were very accommodating and pleasant to boot! Parking is also a real bargain - just across the street and only $20 per 24 hours, about half of what the other hotels charge. The continental breakfast included bagels, doughnuts, coffee and milk, which is all one really needs. If you're adventurous and want something more for breakfast, try the Cuban restaurant immediately across the street - cheap eats and very good. A real experience. If heading back to midtown, we will stay there in an instant."
249,1778,"May 31 2006	Great Location	As all the other reviewers say this hotel is in a great location, so close to Times Square and of course the subway in Times Square. When we arrived we asked to see the room before we took the luggage up, our room was a good size, from what people had told me about NY hotels I thought we might get a shoe box but this wasn't the case. The room was at the front of the hotel and on the top floor, it was still noisy (street noise) but fine if you can use earplugs. Beds were very comfortable, room and bathroom clean, we always had a good supply of hot water for baths and showers. Breakfast was a plus, you get bagels, doughnuts, cereal, toast, fruit, orange juice, tea and coffee - you basically help yourself grab a table. We got a cab from the hotel to the airport and you pre-pay at reception and it cost $55.00."
250,1778,"May 29 2006	Enjoyed The Comfort In Mid Town NYC	My wife and I stayed at the Mid Town Comfort Inn for three nights and enjoyed it tremendously. A luxury hotel it is not, but it was more than adequate and the price was the least expensive that I could find. $170.00 per night with $20.00 per night validated parking fee at a nearby (across the street) parking garage. There is an added savings in the complimentary breakfast. The rooms are small, but adequate. The bed was comfortable and clean. The bath had a combination tub shower. Everything was very clean and was refreshed each day while we were out. The front desk was very cordial and helpful with any questions. I purchased the tickets for the &quot;Red Bus&quot; (Greylines) from the front desk clerk and was told that they could give me a discount. Another savings! I requested and received a room away from 46th St. side of the motel and did not experience any excessive outside noise.The Comfort Inn Mid Town's location should over ride the small room reports."
251,1778,"May 29 2006	Great location clean room helpful staff terrific price.	My friend and I stayed three nights at the Comfort Inn Midtown and we were very happy with everything about the hotel. It was my first visit to NYC and I chose this hotel because of reviews on TripAdvisor. I was a little nervous about it because there were a few negative comments in some of the reviews, but our experience was very positive. The staff went out of their way to be helpful to us and our room was very clean and comfortable. We were on the 5th floor and we asked for the front because we wanted the view. It was a bit noisy at times, but we just considered it &quot; the music of the city&quot;. It has great, authentic New York City atmosphere, and staying there was an important part of our experience of the city. The location and price make it a terrific deal. I will stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown anytime I can get back to New York."
252,1778,"May 27 2006	Location but a bot noisy	Nice hotel and a great location, the only down side was the noise in the morning. Our room overlooked the main street and was on the fifth floor. The delivery trucks and binmen start early about 4:15am and woke me up for every morning for the 4 nights we were there. but not my wife! The breakfast is basic but nice.But this is only a small inconvenience for a great location and in my opinion a well run clean hotel. If you do book and want a snack or a drink the bar across the road &quot;O'briens&quot; is ideal, great burgers and very friendly bar staff. Would I go back to the same hotel? Yes."
253,1778,"May 21 2006	Location location location	Stayed on the 12th floor on this hotel in April 2006. We were not expecting much as the cost of the 4 person room was competitive. We were pleasantly surprised!! A comfortable room, excellent location, free coffee (from the reception area), complimentary newspapers and a satisfactory buffet breakfast. Added to these were freindly, competent staff and free luggage storage after checking out.I would not however book private transfers on the return to your airport (as recommended by the hotel) - I would go with a yellow cab, just as easy and cheaper."
254,1778,"May 16 2006	Comfort Inn Midtown Great Value	Location, location, location. This hotel is less than a block from Times Square and within 4 blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. The rooms are basic but very clean. The thing that we liked about the room was that it was very quiet..no streetnoise at all..and we had a beautiful view. The deluxe continential breakfast was very nice and since it is included, it is a great value...We will stay here again."
255,1778,"May 15 2006	Fantastic hotel!	Location, Location, location! We were a bit concerned about our New York stay as many hotels had had terrible reviews on Trip Advisor. We turned up at the Comfort Inn Midtown and we were really surprised with the hotel. The location is fantasic, bathrooms clean, staff friendly, good breakfast and it was a great stay overall.The location is excellent - a stones throw to Times Square, subway, Macy's, Emipre State etc. Would definitely stay here again."
256,1778,"May 13 2006	Small but great location	Booked this hotel via the web for a 1 night stopover on my way back from CT. The location is awesome! Just a block from Times Square, 1/2 block from the Rockefeller Center subway station. The staff was very friendly, both at check in and later when I checked out. A Continental breakfast is offered and was very convenient. The hotel was very clean, even the basement where the ice machine is located. The room itself was very clean, had a coffee pot (which was nice) and.... well that's about all the good I can say about the room. I have never stayed in a room that small. Now don't get me wrong, for a quick one night or just 1 person, it was fine. I couldn't imagine spending a few days in the room with my wife. There just isn't enough room, especially the bathroom. The bathroom was nice and it seems to be recently redone so it is not one of those 30 year old NY bathrooms. The good part is you can do everything by standing in one place :) I could touch all the walls from standing in the middle of the bathroom. Cruise ships have bigger cabins and showers, no kidding.  As others have mentioned, the room was very hot even while it was cool outside. The have signs saying do not open the window so I turned on the window AC and it never got the room cold. The view was of a brick wall 2 feet away :) My friends were staying at the Pennsylvania on 34th street and I went down to meet them. Compared to the Comfort Inn the hotel was very dirty. The hallways were drab and in need of repair as was the room. I would never stay there. I take that back, I might stay there, but not with my wife. I can put up with a lot, including dirty, but she would have problems with it. The the room was twice the size of the room at the Comfort Inn but the room at the Comfort Inn wins hands down! I added this in just for comparison. Oh yea, the line to check in was about 30 minutes. The longest line I saw at the Comfort Inn was 1 person. Would I stay there again, you bet! If I was going by myself or with my wife for just 1 or 2 nights it would be perfect. The location, the cleanliness and the friendly staff make it a nice place to stay."
257,1778,"May 7 2006	Good Choice Excellent Value	We chose this hotel after much searching and reading the reviews of many many hotels in Manhattan.We are extremely fussy about cleanliness and can honestly say that the room was clean with a comfortable bed which was also very clean. The air conditioner was quite noisy but was necessary as the room was very warm. We had read that the rooms were small and we expected to be more cramped than we were and although our room was not large it was large enough for what we needed. It contained a double bed, wardrobe, table and chair, bedside table, television stand, iron, ironing board and coffee making facilities. Our room faced a brick wall but we were not in it long enough for this to bother us.The bathroom was a good size and that was also clean, the water pressure on the shower was good and there was a constant supply of hot water. The breakfast was good; being included in the price has to be a bonus in New York.We found all the staff that we came into contact with friendly and helpful.The location we feel could not have been better and the cost of the hotel very reasonable.If we ever return to Manhattan we will definitely choose this hotel again."
258,1778,"May 7 2006	locationlocationlocation	This hotel is one-half a block from time square.The staff are great,rooms were clean,the beakfast was good. Rooms on the small side but well maintained. Would return next trip. Canada loves New York City"
259,1778,"May 1 2006	no comfort but great location	For the theater district, the location is great. Our room was extremely tiny and uncomfortable, even by New York standards, and there was no means of circulating air. No fan or AC and the windows were right up against another building so they provided no relief (actually, we weren't supposed to open them but we had no choice). The heat was uncontrollable, making it impossible to sleep. They told us there was no other room available. Quite the disappointment after having booked months in advance. Rooms like ours are the type they should have saved till the very end for last minute walk-ins. Check your room first!"
260,1778,"Apr 24 2006	Good Value in Midtown	While not the swankiest hotel in the midtown area the Comfort Inn Midtown was reasonably priced (for NYC), with reasonably sized rooms (for NYC ) with friendly staff. The rooms and lobby were clean and the breakfast was adequate. However, the room was never at the right temperature and the air conditioner was very loud. Overall it was a positive stay and I would stay there again."
261,1778,"Apr 23 2006	Great value and location	We booked this hotel, after staying at the Muse Hotel the previous year and being impressed by the reviews and the obvious better-value rates. We were very impressed, much better value than the over-rated hotel across the street. Although this is not a boutique hotel, it is perfect for what we are looking for in a new york hotel - excellent location, good value, clean rooms and friendly staff.I was somewhat surprised to read a previous review, stating that the breakfast guy was a 'jobsworth'. The man could not do enough for you in the morning, he also works through the rest of the day in the hotel, so he has is work cut out for him. I wouldn't want to pick up bread if someone is sticking their hands in the container - that's what the tongs are there for!!Overall, probably the best value hotel around Times Square. This was our second visit to NYC and although we loved this hotel, we will probably stay around the Village on our next visit, as Times Square is just far too touristy after a first vist.If you want to stay in Times Square - book this hidden gem."
262,1778,"Apr 19 2006	Right in the middle of things	For our first trip we booked this hotel because of location and price. And we were not sorry!It is a nice little hotel half a block from Times Square. But it is on a guiet street and staying there you would never know the that you were that close to TS. There are several restaurants on the street and a deli, diner, nail salon and tapas bar.Breakfast is included in the price, it's not much, but all you need to get you started in the morning.Our room was of average size, not as cramped as I imagined. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice and clean. I'm very fussy about baths and toilets and was comfortable with what we got. The airconditioner makes a lot of noise, but you get used to it.The staff was ok, some very nice and helpful (doormen, &quot;breakfast guy&quot;, housekeeper) the people in reception so and so.I would stay here again and recommend it to everyone."
263,1778,"Apr 18 2006	Enjoyed the area	A great place to stay especially for the fair price, the convinence and close to Time Square, one block away. Continental breakfast a good plus. The room may be small but no problem. Staff courteous and very helpful. Only diassatisfaction was with my poor hearing close caption was not available on the TV. I do though highly recommend this hotel and I travel frequently with my daughter."
264,1778,"Apr 18 2006	Cozy and Comfortable Hotel	We spent four days in New York in March prior to a cruiseand I was SO glad I had chosen the Comfort Inn Midtown.It was extremely cold and windy while we were there and we were glad we could go to wonderful restaurants close by and a short walk to the Broadway shows. Also when we had to leave very early in the morning before the breakfast room opened to attend Regis and Kelly, we found the McDonald's right around the corner very convenient for a quick, hot breakfast before the ordeal of waiting outside the studio in the cold. If you want a beautiful view and various amenities, be prepared to spend about $400 to $500 a night in New York. If you're looking for a spotlessly clean, comfortable hotel in an excellent location, this is it."
265,1778,"Apr 12 2006	Everything I Look For	I made my reservations at the Comfort Inn after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. Believe the reviews - we were very pleased with this hotel. It met all of my travel requirements: CLEAN - one of the cleanest rooms I've stayed in, definitely the cleanest I've encountered in NYC.CONVENIENT - you really couldn'd ask for a better location for doing all the tourist-y stuff. It was a great &quot;home base&quot;.AFFORDABLE - our rate was $149 a night. Wow.Other notes: the shower pressure was great (hard to find in a hotel sometimes) and we always had hot water. The hotel was generally quiet, although we could hear water pipes at work through the walls at times. The room was a bit small, but I expect that in a large city in an affordable hotel. Our room was on the 2nd floor, so we were able to use the stairs and avoid waiting on the elevator.We definitely plan to stay at the Comfort Inn on our next visit!"
266,1778,"Apr 5 2006	Location Location Location	Location for Times Square you cannot beat. Hotel room was large enough and cleaned on a daily basis. Limited breakfast with a &quot;jobsworth&quot; attendant very curt and somewhat rude when people didnt use the bread tongues, and place holders in the correct place. To be honest we got some amusement watching his face when this happened.The hotel lift is very small so be aware when taking suitcases upto your room.Dont let these picky remarks put you off as we are going back again for New Year. Location is ideal, rooms clean and large enough. 3 Star hotel in a 5 Star location."
267,1778,"Apr 2 2006	Great Location.Very good value	Stayed here for one night and was very impressed with the hotel.The location is great.Very close to Times Square,Radio City,and Rockefeller Plaza.Parking across the street was $20 for 24 hrs.Easy check-in.The rooms were basic but clean.Couldn't beat the price of $150 for midtown Manhattan.Will be staying here again on my next trip to NYC."
268,1778,"Mar 31 2006	Bit of a Letdown...But	After reading the great reviews on this website, me and my boyfriend booked this hotel for a 4 night stay in New York. We stayed at the Milford Plaza 2 years ago and found it OK, but just decided to try somewhere different. However, we were slightly disappointed with this one. Yes it was clean and you really can't fault it for it's excellent location - literally just steps away from practically everything. So in that respect, the value for money was really good. And I'm not one of those people who whinges about ridiculous things like the air con being too loud, but I just found this hotel a bit shoddy. The staff weren't all that helpful and if you wanted something booking then you had to go and ring them yourself which was unusual for a hotel (after visiting hundreds) and little things like that just help you with your trip. The rooms were also unbearably hot and the only way to cool yourself was to use the fan which when we turned it on smelt like a mens urinal (and I'm really not exaggerating) so it made it uncomfortable to sleep (which is all we did in the room).The fabulous breakfast included that everyone talks about is just average - if that. You eat off of paper plates and with plastic knives and forks, which again I know may sound snobby but it just felt shabby. The man in the tiny breakfast room, which we had to wait outside for space at least 2 mornings (it only seated 4 tables) was good and kept the area clean though.All in all we had a good stay but it's nice to feel a bit special when visitng somewhere as great as New York, and this hotel just didn't do that. We travelled on a budget and never stay in posh hotels - as long as they're clean and in a good location I'm pleased enough. However, the strange bellman at this hotel didn't even help with our bags and when you pass all those lovely hotels and see what goes on in them it just makes you see how the Comfort Inn is a bit run down and needs better mannered staff."
269,1778,"Mar 31 2006	Can't complain with the comfort inn	This hotel has to be rated excellent for the following reasons;. So cheap especially if you book online, myself n my sis stayed for 5 days for 313 between us.The location is unbelievble, in the centre of times square.almost everything is in walking distance (we got the sub twice, to the statue of liberty, and central park). No need to pay for taxis.its right next to the times square info centre so buy ur tickets there for the statue of liberty n u save queing time.The staff are so friendly and helpful, they let our friend (from brooklyn) stay for free and brought us blankets, without us even asking can she stay. the free continental breakfast is beautiful with, toast, bagels, cereal, dognuts, juice, tea n coffee, and the guy who serves it keeps offering you more.the rooms are very clean but basic, it has cable tv to in ur room, the maid is lovely very trustworthyI want to go back next year and will deffo be staying here again. If you want a cheap stay in new york definatley stay here you'll save a fortune."
270,1778,"Mar 29 2006	Great value great location too much heat	Our room was located on the seventh floor facing a building. The gentleman that checked us in told us that he was going to put us on the quiet side of the hotel. Quiet meant facing a brick wall, which really didn't bother my husband and I. The main problem was the temperature of the room. It was uncomfortably warm and there was no way to turn the heat down. We voiced our concerns at the desk and the said that they would look intoit. Obviously there was ot much that anyone could do, since the heating system seems to be automatic. Even though there was a sign that said not to open the window, we did anyway. Unfortunately this did not help the temperature of the room. I'm not sure what the answer to the problem was. The morning breakfast was quite adequate and the location could not be beat. Maybe if it is cold outside itwould not be a problem. I should have tried plugging in the air conditioning unit to see if that would have cooled off the room."
271,1778,"Mar 16 2006	Best hotel I've ever stayed at!!!	Ok.. now i've stayed in hotels all over the world (from $$$ to $) and I must say for the price you pay, this is the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Stayed there my 1st &amp; 2nd times in NYC (both being a single female traveler). Hotel is a 1/2 block from Times Square &amp; Theatre District and 2 blocks from Rockerfella Center, NBC Studios, 5th Avenue Shopping. ALL hotel staff was more than helpful and extremely friendly. Hotel was very clean, and was not a bad size for a NY hotel room. Featured on a quiet side street with no traffic noise at night. Very secure &amp; safe would recommend it to any one! Hotel windows didn't have the best view, because you are on a side street, but who wants to stay in the hotel all day? Especially when you're so close to the action!"
272,1778,"Mar 7 2006	Great ""Value for Money"" Hotel!!!	Just returned from a trip to New York. Spent a week at the Comfort Inn, Midtown. I chose this hotel after much research on the Trip Advisor web site and can honestly say that I thought this hotel was excellent. The location of the hotel was great, just 2 mins walk and you are in Times Square. I went with my two daughters and we stayed in a room for 4 which had 2 queen sized beds in. The room was not big but was adequate. It was very clean and sheets and towels were changed every day. Our room was at the back of the hotel so we didn't have a &quot;view&quot; but this was not important as we didn't spend much time in the hotel room! The staff in the hotel were always very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was included in the price and this included toast, cereal, bagels, doughnuts, fresh fruit, tea, coffee and fruit juice. If I ever return to New York I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced hotel in an excellent location."
273,1778,"Mar 4 2006	What a deal	This hotel is perfectly situated and is the bargain of the century. For about $100 you stay on 46th St close to Times Square, free contintental breakfast and a clean room with pleasant staff. What more could you ask for? If you're looking for luxury this is not the place. If you want comfortable accomodations at a reasonable price it is the place for you."
274,1778,"Mar 4 2006	Still A Bargain	This was my second time staying two nights at this hotel in the past eight months. I got a great midweek rate with my Auto Club discount, $98.99. I arrived about 2 1/2 hours prior to check-in but was given a room anyway. Check-in was lengthy because I arrived on March 1st, the day a new computer system was introduced, so there were some glitches with it, but that was to be expected and I didn't mind, since I was early anyway. The room I had this time, while still a queen-size, was a bit larger than the last time I stayed there, as was the bathroom. However, it seemed a bit more worn down than before: the bedspread had seen better days, the carpet was shredded where it met the bathroom, the telephone cord was frayed, the phone books were outdated, and there was a strange dent in the wall. I was on the sixth floor on the church side (the hotel is adjacent to a Catholic Church) so I did hear the church bells regularly. The room was very hot. When I asked the cleaning lady how to adjust the heat she simply opened the window, in the middle of a snowstorm! And there's still the problem with the doors that close themselves and slam loudly while doing so. If you're a business traveler and needing to get up in the morning this might not bother you, but I was there on pleasure and didn't enjoy the slams at 6:30 in the morning. Overall, however, this is still a good deal and the location can't be beat. You're right between subway stops at Times Square and Rockefeller Center, and my favorite Cuban restaurant, Havana Central, is just down the street. (Check out their dulce de leche martinis.) In fact, just about anything you could possibly need is within walking distance, the staff is pleasant and helpful, and the free continental breakfast will save you a few bucks."
275,1778,"Feb 28 2006	Great Deal!	Trying to find a hotel in NY was harder than I expected, I didn't realize that just staying for one night was expensive almost everywhere I looked until I found the Comfort Inn Midtown. If you use your triple A card you recieve a discount of $99 a night (we stayed on a Sunday night). Yes the room was small, but for two people it was all we needed. Very clean, staff was very nice and there was free continental breakfast which was good. There is a deli only a few buildings down for a great lunch or snack. I would definetely reccomend this hotel."
276,1778,"Feb 24 2006	Wonderful!	This hotel exceeded my expectations. I arrived 3 hours before check-in but was given a room right away. Everybody at this hotel was helpful and pleasant. The room was small, but it was spotless, quiet, and featured all the amenities. And, as everbody says, the location can't be beat. I will definitely stay here again. It is a budget hotel in price only - a real New York City jewel."
277,1778,"Feb 22 2006	Location Location Location!	Similar to the last post, problems may occur if you check-in late at night.We were 2 couples, &amp; we booked this hotel after spending hours looking at other reviews &amp; prices etc. We booked the room over the telephone directly with Applecore Hotels in September 2005 &amp; I received a fax confirming our booking. It did state on the fax that if we were going to check-in after 10 pm to let the hotel know in advance. As our flight wasn't due to land until around 11 pm, I sent the hotel an e-mail a month ago to let them know. I never received an acknowledgement even though I requested one. The week before we went, I sent another e-mail, this time directly to Applecore Hotels, also requesting that they acknowledge this, but again, no response.When we finally arrived at the hotel, it was 1am &amp; as soon as we stepped into the lobby, the clerk looked up, knew our names but then proceeded to say that a slight problem had occurred &amp; that due to a 'medical emergency', the last guests who were in our room had to stay on for another night &amp; that he had made arrangements for us to stay at a hotel down the road for the same price for 1 night only. The other hotel was Super 8, again owned by Applecore. We didn't have a lot of choice at that time in the morning, especially as we knew that they already had our credit card details. We were bundled into a taxi &amp; given $5 to pay the fare, and we literally drove about 200 yards up the road to the other hotel.We didn't want to bother unpacking for 1 night &amp; thought about staying there for the rest of our trip, a further 3 nights, but it was around $50 more expensive per night. It was a good job we didn't! Our room was overlooking the street, &amp; the noise was unbearable all night long. The curtains didn't close &amp; the blinds were all tattered &amp; ripped, the lighting in both the bedroom &amp; the bathroom was dismal.The next morning we checked out, &amp; walked back to the Comfort Inn. I was pleasantly surprised at our rooms. They were so peaceful! No noise at all (no view either) but at least we could sleep OK. The bed was kingsize &amp; very comfortable. There was loads of space for clothes, iron, hairdryer, coffee making &amp; a large TV.The bedroom/bathroom was so much better than the other hotel, also very clean.There was also FREE internet access in the lobbyThe breakfast was the usual, cereal, toast, bagels &amp; choice of pastries &amp; fruit. They even had Tetley T-Bags! Couldn't complain about the facilities there.The main thing about this hotel is the location. You simply walk out of the lobby, turn right &amp; within 1 minute, you are standing outside TGI Fridays, right in Times Square. By the way, look out for the web cam directly outside of TGI's-It's great fun having a morning wave into the camera &amp; lots of people obviously had family/friends at home on the internet looking at www.earthcam.com where it's real time.On the way back to the hotel every night, we stopped at a Cuban bar a few doors up from the hotel for a nightcap. Brilliant atmosphere, great music &amp; lovely Cubre Libres!All in all, yes, it was great shame about the beginning of this trip, but once settled in, we were all happy to have chosen this hotel &amp; it would be my first choice when we return to New York.(We paid $109 Fri night $139 Sat &amp; Sun, this rate was per room &amp; included breakfast, but not taxes)Please feel free to ask any questions."
278,1778,"Feb 15 2006	Don't Check in at night	Hotel is a great deal- especially when you book far in advance. Unfortunately, don't expect your room to be there if you are coming in late at night. We arrived at 11:30pm and were told that they had given our 2 rooms away because they couldn't charge our card. 2 hours later and on the phone with credit card company who was telling us that we had been charged for the rooms that night, we had the night desk person offer us 2 rooms at 3 times the rate we booked. We had to walk around times square and find a small hotel for the night and had to come back the next day to deal with the manager. Not a good way to start your trip! Once the manager cleared everything up and apologized (we were still out an extra $300), things seemed to be looking up. On our 2nd night there, my friend caught one of the desk people going into our room to look for &quot;tape&quot;- we had not been told or called and so he went in and watched them while they moved a couple of things around and left.As much as it was a great deal initially, sometimes it's true that you get what you pay for."
279,1778,"Feb 12 2006	Great location	Was a little nervous about this hotel, but had read the reviews and reckoned it was worth a chance. The location is great - Times Square at the end of the road. The staff were friendly and helpful and the free breakfast was a bonus. The room was a little cramped - but who cares? It was nice and warm and very clean. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel, and even the pillows were great. I am recommending this to everyone I know - it is a real bargain."
280,1778,"Feb 12 2006	Compact Gem!	Great hotel in the middle of midtown. Great value and ok sized rooms. Continental breakfast in the best ive had in a budget inn! Look for Antonio doing breakfast, he will look after you. All in all a great place to stay in NYC. Would stay there again."
281,1778,"Feb 6 2006	Great Buy as Well as Friendly Staff	This small hotel just off Time Square is just what it is advertised plus you get a staff that genuinely makes you feel you are welcome. From instructions how to ride the subway to getting half price tickets for some shows, Ivonne and CDB were a wealth of information and also eager for out-of-towners, new to the city to enjoy themselves. Rooms are small but newly remodeled, clean, and very realistically priced. We will stay there again.S. Schenck - New Orleans"
282,1778,"Feb 3 2006	A midtown value miracle	This is a remarkable value in the heart of the theatre district. You`re literally a one minute walk to Times Square and not much further to Rockerfeller Center and Fifth Avenue shopping. Everything in this 79 room hotel is compact, including the welcoming mahogany and marble lobby. The staff greets you warmly and they are eager to respond to your questions and requests. There is a single elevator that will take you to your compact, but well thought out room. Everything seems new here. You`ll find very nice neo-shaker furnishings, floral patterned, valanced draperies and matching bedspreads. Our mattress was firm and extremely comfortable. The carpeting and colorfully bordered wallpaper are unblemished. There is also subtle recessed ceiling lighting and a small but adequate corner closet. We were on the top floor in room 904 with a queen sized bed. We were on the side of the building and didn`t hear a sound from the street or from neighboring guests. Rooms ending in 01 and 02 are directly on the 46th street side and will probably have street noise. The compact, sparkling bathroom is all new with floor to ceiling white tiles, marble floor, pedestal sink and gleaming fixtures....also Comfort Inns` signature curved shower bar. You`ll also find all of Comfort Inns` regular amenities here, including free local calls, iron/ironing board, newspaper, and available toiletries from housekeeping, just in case you`ve forgotten something. There is also a very good free expanded continental breakfast in the compact, but pleasant breakfast room off the lobby. This includes, pastries, bagels, breads, juices, yogurts, fruit, cereal, coffee and even cappucino. For all this we paid an unbelievable $89 per night. Housekeeping keeps everything spotless here and maintenance is also impressive. I challenge anyone to find a better rate for this kind of quality in New York. We met friends who were staying at a neighboring hotel and paying nearly 3 times as much for a shabby, dirty room, a rude staff, and no breakfast. We`ll definitely be making this our hotel home whenever we visit the city. Not to be missed!!"
283,1778,"Feb 1 2006	Another Successful Stay / Great Value	After reading several favourable reviews of this property, we stayed there for the 2nd time in the last 8 months. Once again, the rooms were clean and of ample size (especially for NYC). The location near Times Square is ideal to walk to many locations or to access the nearby subway lines. Staff are great to deal with and very helpful.We will definitely be returning to this hotel in the future."
284,1778,"Jan 20 2006	Great hotel even better value	We stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown for two nights, and our stay couldn't have been better!For us the LOCATION of this hotel, along with the fair price, sold us.The staff was also very helpful and pleasant. We arrived 3 hours before check-in, and they did allow us to check in early.We were on the 9th floor... room 903. It was small, but not as small as I thought it would be! The room was spotless, and the bathroom was fine. While there is no counter, there is a large windowsill that you can put your toiletries on. Our view looked out to another building, but we could also see some NY sights!This hotel is IN the theatre district, and is in walking distance to MANY attractions. You can get to the airport via a $28 cab ride, or take the train and bus, which only costs $4 per person.Overall, I don't think we'd stay anywhere else in NYC!"
285,1778,Jan 19 2006	Lovely Location and Friendly Staff	This hotel exceeded my expectations. The location was perfect and the staff from the front desk to the bellhop was friendly and nice. I felt welcome and the staff often went out of their way to accomodate. I was offered coffee so many times when walking thru the lobby. Great experience. An excellent place to spend my MLK weekend.
286,1778,"Jan 18 2006	Last-minute reservation first-rate stay!	When my son and I had an opportunity to stay an extra night in NY but hadn't made a hotel reservation, I read in the NY Times Guide to NY that the Comfort Inn Midtown was a reasonable choice for budget travelers like us. I called at the last minute and got a double room for $100, and I couldn't believe the value! The room was small, but clean and modern. No view to speak of, but very quiet on the back side of the hotel. Everything worked, beds were comfortable, and a fairly good continental breakfast was available beginning at 7 a.m. The location was extremely convenient, near theaters, subway, Midtown attractions. I am recommending this place to everyone I know and plan to stay there the next time we are visiting New York."
287,1778,"Jan 17 2006	perfect location great value	We have just returned from 7 nights at this hotel. It has been wonderful. The location couldn't be better. A few minutes walk from nearest metro station and Times Square. 10 to 15 minutes walk from bus station where we were dropped by shuttle bus from Newark Airport. Very pleasant check in with no question about not being able to have our room before check in time.2nd floor back room plenty big enough for city hotel. Deliciously comfy bed. Everything working in the bathroom and all spotlessly clean. View of concrete wall and quite dark but this was compensated by being completely quiet. No sound of traffic at any time. We thought this was a great bonus considering it is right in the centre. Why do people slam doors though? There's no need. With care they could be closed with a little click. This was the only noise we heard. Don't know how anybody can complain about the free breakfast. Juice, cereal, coffee, chocolate, bagels, bread, jam, philly etc, all looked after by a fastidious guy who kept it all spotlessly clean.Don't like to criticise this hotel at all but there was just one thing. Our room was never made up until about 3pm. This meant that it was a bit of a problem if we fancied going back to have a little rest in the afternoon - we usually went out about 7.15am. Only a small thing but that would have made it a perfect budget city hotel. As it is it is pretty damned near!!!! Would return again any time."
288,1778,"Jan 15 2006	Location location!!!!	The best thing about this hotel is the location - walk down the street and you are in the middle of Times Square - you can't fault that! The room was an ok size - a long time since it has been renovated though - we had to change rooms from a room at the front of the building - garbage trucks all night! But our room towards the back of the hotel was much better - the hotel has a very ancient lift - still works but feels very rickety - free breakfast included - basically donuts, toast, coffee and tea and juice - not much else - If you could pay the same rate and be in as good a location then I would look for somewhere else a bit more modern - but if it is all you can afford, and want to be in the middle of the manhattan action and do not have high expectations then this is the place for you - nothing wrong with it - just is very basic."
289,1778,"Jan 4 2006	No comfort at the Comfort Inn	My girldfriend and I (both in our early 20's) stayed at the Comfort Inn for 2 nights (January 1st and 2nd).We arrived at 1h30 PM on January the 1st and were told that no room were ready since everyone went to bed late the night before bla bla bla (room maid began their shift at 9h30 AM so...) by the rude receptionnist who told us that check-in was at 3h PM and not before. Coming from the Barclay Intercontinental where we had a room at 8H30AM, we felt kinda mad, but still, waited.We got our room at 2h45 PM. The room was on the 5th floor which was obviously on the small side. The AC unit wasn't working and the heating system was way to hot, so we had to sleep with the window open all night (but it wasn't that bad, not that noisy outside...well, that's before 7h AM when the nearby church rings it's bells.)The bathroom was discusting, hair (and pubic hair) rolling all over the floor. The location and the price however cannot be beat! The good thing about having a crappy room is that you definitly don't want to stay inside. Therefore, you spend more time in NY than in your room!"
290,1778,"Dec 28 2005	Great Location--no extra beds!!	This hotel has a terrific location--midway between Rockefeller Center and Broadway. Room was generous in size with a queen bed but no opportunity for a rollaway for an additional person, despite being assured that this was possible through Hotels.com. Price was very reasonable for date (Christmas week) and location. Climate control was not so great--room seemed warm and hard to turn the heat down and 1 towel looked to have hair on it (though appeared not to have been used). Positives include location, location, location, free use of computer with printer in lobby, small exercise facility and free generous breakfast including good bagels, donuts, cold cereal, coffee, juice, fresh apples and bananas and firm mattress. All in all a good value for the price and a discount of 10% if over age 50."
291,1778,"Dec 19 2005	Very nice hotel in excellent location	Just returned from a pleasant weekend trip to New York where we stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown. Cant say enough good things about a clean and attractive, reasonably priced hotel, conveniently located in the Times Square-Theater District. Our 6th floor room was recently renovated along with new furnishings.Although on the smaller side, the room was more than comfortable and accommodated a Queen size bed. The location couldnt be better with major attractions, such as Times Square, Empire State Building, St. Patricks Cathedral, Macys , Rockefeller Center, Radio City and Central Park, within easy walking distance. The hotel staff were all extremely pleasant and in the mornings, guests were provided a complimentary breakfast of pastries, bagels, fruit, coffee and juices. Definitely planning to stay here again on return visits to New York City!"
292,1778,"Dec 14 2005	Very Friendly Great Value but ""OK"" hotel	My husband, sons (ages 3 and 6) and I had stayed at The Hampton Inn for one night the first week of December. We wanted to extend our trip, but The Hampton was booked, so we chose the Comfort Inn Midtown for our second night. We chose this hotel because the price could not be beat, and the reviews on this website were favorable. We paid under $300 (total with tax)for one night ,while all the other rooms we had looked up online were $400 plus. The hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly, but the rooms are very small. The window in our room had a wall air conditioner in it, and the blinds above the AC were closed. When I peeked out the window, all I pretty much saw was another building or wall, very close. The room was a little dark because of this lack of outside light. The heating system is old; we had a radiator in our room, which had to be manually turned on.I was concerned that the room would get too hot, but it didn't.( There was cold air coming in the room from the window air condioner.) The radiator was enclosed behind a door (with a panel on it that allowed for the heat to escape.)Behind this door, in front of the radiator, was the largest rat trap I have ever seen.(I think it was maybe the only rat trap I have ever seen!) I suppose this is common in New York, but I would have preferred not to have seen it. Also, two of the pillows in our room were torn; you could see the stuffing inside of them. Maybe our expectations were a little high because we had just come from a hotel that had been recently upgraded, and had larger rooms. We're thankful that the price was right, and that everyone was friendly.(The bellhop was especially helpful, and kind to my kids.)However, we don't think this hotel will be our first choice when we return to New York."
293,1778,"Dec 9 2005	Will stay there again	We stayed here for 5 nights, from November 30 through December 5. I booked it because of all the good reviews on Tripadvisor, AND because it was probably the least expensive hotel in the area. What a gem it turned out to be. It is one half block from Times Square, yet our room was very quiet. Though small, the room was very clean and comfortable. We were on the 7th floor with a view of the roof of the church next door. (By the way, one of the other recent reviews here said that you can have a view of the Empire State Building: not true, they must have confused this Comfort Inn with a different one). One peculiarity was that it seemed that the radiator-type heat was always on, which is good because it was very cold in NYC, but the only way to reduce the heat to a comfortable level was to turn on the air conditioner. It worked, so no problem. The people at the front desk were extremely helpful and attentive. They found deals for us to various attractions, and booked a sedan for us back to the airport, as well as let us store our luggage until we left in the afternoon. When we return to New York City we will most definitely stay there again."
294,1778,"Dec 6 2005	Great Experience	After searching for a &quot;reasonably-priced&quot; place to stay in Midtown Manhattan, this is what we settled on. (There really is no such thing as a clean, nice place to stay that is truly reasonable in NYC.) At any rate, we were very pleasantly surprised. If you close the curtains (thereby eliminating the view of the brick wall) you might imagine yourself in a quaint country inn. The room was a bit small, but it was cozy, clean and really quite lovely. We didn't spend much time in the room, but that was not the point of this vacation.We would stay there again in a New York minute. :-)"
295,1778,"Nov 29 2005	A gem in the city	We stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown for five nights in November. It may not be the ritz but it is a very comfortable, clean hotel in a fantastic location (times square is one block away). The staff are very friendly and helpful - I wanted to change rooms after the first night as it was unseasonably warm in New York and the room was unbearably hot - we were given a new room no problem. All this with a free breakfast! I searched for weeks to find the perfect hotel but having read the reviews on tripadvisor I opted for a reasonably priced comfortable hotel and found a gem!"
296,1778,"Nov 19 2005	Great hotel!!	My husband and i stayed at the comfort inn midtown from 2 sep-9sep.We got a great rate at 149 dollars pr night and the location was just the best,espesially for us travelling to New York for the first time.The housekeeper kept it clean and we got fresh towels every day.And what a quiet hotel...i cant belive that i stayed a half block from times square.Minus for small room and our window facing a brick wall.Remember to tip the man in the breakfast room,he was so helpful and nice. He is also the man who`s vacuing the hallways,so he is working for his bucks :o).It`s in a such a great location that we didn`t take a taxi once...used the subway for long distances but walked almost everywhere.We had a great time and would defenetly stay there again."
297,1778,"Nov 18 2005	Fantastic Hotel	Stayed here last December, and it was a fantastic hotel to saty in. We were there for 4 nights. The room was non-smoking as requested, and imagine our joy when we got to the room (near the top of the hotel), flung back the curtains to see a fantatstic view of the empire state building, as it is just the block behind. When you book, try and book a room at the 'back left corner' of the hotel, to get the view. Waking up to the empire state building in the dawn and seeing it lit up at night was brilliant. Clean hotel, decor a little shabby in the room but hey. Clean towels daily. The concierge was lovely, very helpful, couldn't do enough for us. Great location as well, right by macys and fifth ave, subway on the corner of the block. We flew into Newark airport and took the airtrain to Penn station, this hotel is a couple of blocks walk away - no need for a cab.We're off to NYC in a couple of weeks, unfortunlaty left it too late to book in here again :( trying the new yorker instead this time, will see how it measures up!"
298,1778,"Nov 14 2005 	Comfort Inn Midtown: Not Bad at All	Hey, for under $200 bucks (since my husband is considered a &quot;mature traveler&quot; at age 51--we got a 10% discount)--this place isn't half bad.Here's what was good: The price, the adequate free breakast, and close to theaters &amp; shopping--we walked everywhere!! For under $200--the rooms were mildly spacious. We were four blocks from Jersey Boys (great show!! I highly recommend it), and the hotel arranged for a shuttle to take us back to the airport (23 bucks each)...The not so good: Two not so plush towels (asked for more, but never got them); no view; rather noisy all over, and not so good toiletries or lighting in the bathroom.I'd stay there again--not fancy, but bearable!"
299,1778,"Nov 2 2005 	excellent for the price	Great location and clean with wireless internet, coffeemaker, tv, iron and a one computer-printer business center. Linens seemed fresh and of decent quality. The room was tiny and had no view but was still a bargain. As to a former comment about loud door noise, my door wouldn't lock unless you slammed it. I mean that's what the staff told me to do to get my door to lock -- and didn't understand when I tried to explain that it would disturb the neighbors. They could work on that issue for sure...."
300,1778,"Oct 24 2005	Clean room Pleasant Staff Good Location for Theaters But..	My husband and I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown earlier this month. We arrived in NYC very early in the AM and they stored our luggage until our room was ready - shortly after 10:30 AM - hours before official check-in time! Throughout our 3 night stay we found staff to be very helpful and pleasant.This Comfort Inn is in a great location for attending the theater and not bad for exploring the city. And the price is certainly resonable for Manhattan. The room was clean, the bathroom was small but attractive, the shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water. The room was very small, however, and the mattress on our bed had seen better days - saggy in the middle. The bedspread was clean but very tired. The biggest problem was the noise from the hallway. Any time someone closed a door on the hall it reverberated in our room loudly enough to startle you out of a deep sleep. We turned on the AC fan to try and drown out the noise but it was not enough. The view from our window was of a brick wall about a foot away. This made the room dark and the lighting was not adequate enough to compensate for this. I would stay here again IF there was a room where the closing doors on the hall did not make me jump and the mattress was not sagging."
301,1778,"Oct 5 2005	We will definitely stay here again!	My husband and I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown from 23 - 25 September and couldn't have been happier. Before arrival I contacted the hotel to request a particular room and they couldn't have been more helpful. Our room was spacious, clean and looked like it had been recently refurbished. Yes, it was a little noisy at night but what do you expect when you are just a stones throw from Times Square! At least if you stay up late in Times Square you only have a couple of minutes walk back to your hotel!We are already planning a return trip to New York (which in my opinion is the best city in the world!) and will not hesitate in rebooking the hotel."
302,1778,"Oct 3 2005 	Nice Spot	I was in town for a two day seminar and the host hotel (Westin) was full, so I went searching for a place to stay. Settled on the Comfort Inn for it's location and value. (About half the price of the host hotel, even with the group rate) I obviously was going to give up a few luxuries, but what the heck, I saved the company a few bucks. Review: Negatives-Very small room (Maybe 12 feet by 12 feet) The plumbing from my neighbor was quite loud and woke me up both mornings at about 6 am. Positives-Great value. Outstanding location, just a block from the heart of Times Sqare. Computer office in the lobby for those who do not have a laptop. Continental breakfast. Friendly staff. For the sheer value and location, this is an excellent hotel. Just don't plan to throw a party in your room."
303,1778,"Sep 23 2005	For New York a great value	The Comfort is in an outstanding location if you like action and convenience. The hotel itself is about what you would expect in a budget accommodation. The hotel is located a block and a half from the Rockefeller Center subway station and is easily accessed. We were in 2 different rooms. We had a street facing room for the first night..a little more noisy since the trash pickups show up at 5 am in the front. We requested a room in the back and the staff was able to oblige. Unlike other reviews, we had no problem with the staff. Both rooms, particularly the first, needed to be remodeled....carpet worn and dirty looking....but the rest of the decor was fine and the bathrooms clean. The bottom line is that prices are outrageous in NYC and this is one of the better in the budget category"
304,1778,"Sep 2 2005	Beware of this hotel	Due to a family situation I had to cancel my reservation. The manager, Rajni Rikh, refused to give me a cancellation number. Even after I expressed concerns about having proof of cancellation, she became very irritated. I called the main Comfort Inn number and they too refused to provide a cancellation number. If you have to cancel at this hotel monitor your credit card carefully since you won't have proof you cancelled."
305,1778,"Aug 29 2005 	Great Value	The reason I give this hotel 5 circles is because of value. I only spent one night at the Comfort Inn Midtown for business. I was able to get a AAA rate that was very good for midtown Manhattan. The room was clean and the bed relatively comfortable. Location, location, location ... if you want a midtown address without the high rates, this is the choice. Service was good too."
306,1778,"Aug 27 2005	A great choice	My husband and I and our two sons stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown from August 22-25. I used this website and relied upon others' reviews when making the booking, as we had never been to NYC before. Everyone was basically right on in their reviews. I thought that since I had used this website to make my decision, I would contribute to it as well to help others. The hotel is not new, nor is it &quot;The Ritz&quot;, but it is very clean and the location is perfect. Times Square is such an exciting place to be, and we were steps away from it. We basically walked everywhere, as the hotel is centrally located. The room was small, but we were gone right after breakfast and didn't return until late in the evening, so it wasn't a big deal. The lighting in the room could have been better, the fan in the bathroom wasn't working, we couldn't open a window, and the air conditioner could have been quieter, but these weren't major things. The continental breakfast was okay - nothing spectacular - but it started us off in the morning and allowed us to get on with our day without first having to find a place to eat. There are some good restaurants in the area - we recommended Bubba Gump Shrimp (named for the movie Forrest Gump).Staying at the Comfort Inn Midtown allowed us to make NYC an affordable holiday. It is perfect if you are looking for something clean, well located and affordable at the same time. We loved NYC and had a terrific time. Hope you will, too."
307,1778,"Aug 23 2005	Loved the Comfort Inn Midtown	We spent 2 nights at the Comfort Inn Midtown 8/18/05-8/20/05. It was great. We got there on the 18th at 11:30am, asking to check our bags. Instead they handed us our room cards and said we could enjoy our room right then. The room was nice. We were on the 6th floor overlooking W 46th Street, and with the A/C on, we rarely heard the street noise. The woman who cleaned the room was very sweet, always wishing us a good morning and a safe trip when we left. The front desk staff was nothing special. They certainly didn't go out of their way to give us advice and were always on their cell phones. But whatever... We took a picture from the steps of the hotel. The red Bank of America sign down the street is in Times Square. If you stay here, do yourself a favor and walk over to Tony's DiNapoli at 147 West 43rd Street. The food was so good, we ate there twice. I highly recommend the caesar salad. And a friendly warning, the pitcher of sangria is huge!"
308,1778,"Aug 16 2005	Great location!	This hotel is in a great location. It is less than a block from Times Square and nearby everything a tourist would want to do.We got there early in the morning, and although we were not able to check in, we were able to drop our luggage off and they stored it in a locked room. The room was relatively small, but I was only there to sleep and shower. It was very clean and had an iron, ironing board, and extra pillows in the small closet. There was a window air conditioner in the room, which was relatively quite, and quickly cooled the room down, which was a relief being it was nearly 100 degrees and very humid in New York! The bathroom was a decent size and stocked w/ amenities. It also had a small coffee maker. My only complaint about the bathroom was the lack of water pressure in the shower.The staff was very freindly and helpful. We had gone to NYC to go to a Yankees game. We knew that we could easily take the subway into the Bronx, but not sure which one to go on. The lady at the front desk was very helpful in advising us what train to get on and told us exactly where the subway station was (about a block away). When we checked out, we had several hours before we had to be at the airport and again they held our luggage for us as we explored more of the city.The bellhop, was a very nice gentleman who offered to get us a car service to the airport for a flat rate. We took him up on this, as it was about the same price as the cab fare getting there was and we did not have to worry about hailing our own cab. I didn't have the free breakfast they offered, but it looked like there was plenty of food, bagels, danish, coffee etc. There are numerous restaurants right on the same block as the hotel, there is a very reasonably priced deli nearby, that had a phenomenal breakfast. I would definelty stay in this hotel again. It is in a great location. And the price can not be beat. For a 2 night stay, in a room with 2 twin beds for a weekend it only cost $360. I have been to NYC a few times before and have stayed at more expensive places, and I can tell you from experience the more expensive places, although they are bigger and have a more elegant lobby, this place can definetly compete with them. So, if you are going to NYC to have fun and explore the city and just need a clean and comfortable place to sleep and shower, this is the place."
309,1778,"Aug 14 2005	check the view from our room!! never we had such a view.	We did try to make a reservation directly to the hotel, but the man was very unfriendly and said the hotel was full for this period. When we did call choicehotels we made the reservation with no trouble.The location is good for broadway and theatervisits. The breakfast is simple but oke, only the breakfastroom has only about 5 little tables and the hotel has many rooms and there is a sign not to take breakfast items to your room - sometimes you just have to wait to sit down for breakfast.The view from the room was realy something else, I donot want to think what will happen if there is a fire - It will be impossible to get out through this window!!Also see the picture taken in the bathtub, yak -it is realy dirty -We only used the shower."
310,1778,"Aug 10 2005	Gem of a hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown in mid-June. It was our first time in NYC and we wanted to be centrally located without having to pay through the nose for a room we'd hardly be in.We got there early in the morning and were able to check in right away. The staff were all friendly - the porter was especially nice. Our room was larger than I expected (based on comments on this site). It was very bright and clean. We had a street view, but at night we didn't hear any noise since we had the A/C on - it was so hot when we were there.Breakfast was basic but hit the spot - bagels, cereal, fuit, yougurt, juice. We didn't use the gym since we were walking 12 hours a day, but it had a stationary bike, treadmill, etc. There is a computer if you need to check your home e-mail or your fave website.And the biggest bonus - it's 100% smoke-free. Beautiful!!The only thing that could concern some people would be the elevator. There is only one and sometimes, it could be busy. We were on the 8th floor, so a few times we took the stairs. Not a problem for us, but some may find it annoying. There is a little screen by the button, so you can see where the elevator is and which way it is going.Would we stay there again? Yes, if the price isn't more than what we paid, which was $169/night. We were pleased with our choice."
311,1778,"Aug 2 2005	Amazing Location!	I wanted to take the time to write on here about this hotel considering I read alot of reviews and based my stay upon them - so I thought I better add my two cents in as well! I stayed here for a week - we were greeted by a very UNFRIENDLY woman at the front desk, our toliet overflowed the second last day and flooded the bathroom, and while we were out they fixed it, but left a huge hair ball in the tub and a pile of 20 or so wet towels in the bathroom (I called front desk and they delt with this asap). The man who I assume in the bellhop - was friendly and super nice and offered much help. We never stayed for breakfast, but it looked like there were alot of food. More importantly, I would stay in this hotel again without hesitation because of the amazing location!!!!!!!!! It is so worth the tiny cramped rooms - your not there for the room and view anyways - atleast I wasnt - you are 1 min walk from times square and a 3 min walk from 5th ave. What more could a girl ask for!?!? Stay here if the price doesnt jump over $250.00 US - If it does you might be able to find a nicer looking hotel for the same price - but JUMP on it if its any cheaper - WELL WORTH IT! =)"
312,1778,"Aug 2 2005	Best Value	The Comfort Inn Midtown was perfect for us. We walked from Grand Central Station with two kids and carryon-type luggage in just about five minutes. It is located in Little Brazil right beside Broadway at Times Square. We couldn't have asked for a better location that was central to everything! There are restaurants of all sizes, ethnic tastes, and price ranges within sight. The staff was friendly and helpful. If you are going on the Gray Line bus tour, buy your tickets at the hotel for a discount. We are already planning a return trip and will definitely book our room at this hotel. I've stayed in four different hotels in the area. This is definitely the cleanest, safest, best staffed, and most convenient.Pam from WV"
313,1778,"Jul 27 2005	A great place to stay in Manhattan!!	We have remained to this comfortable Hotel for about 10 days in the first days of the new year. We had asked at reservation's time, to reserve one room up the sixth floor, couse we had read here that so was better. So, we had one excellent room with sunlight and sight of the skyline too! The room was large and cleaned up everyday, the airy bathroom with a comfortable tube and always changed cloths. The breakfast was really good and various, and the desk's people very kind! The location is ideal in order to move easy in Manhattan, just a block from Times Square, with all the metropolitan's line. If you want a truly comfortable place to a reasonable price, this is the perfect hotel! I definitively recommend it to everybody!"
314,1778,Jul 25 2005	Superb Location	For the money this is the businessThe location 1/2 block from Times Square is where you want to beWhilst the rooms are small everytning else is excellent even down to the breakfastThe 3 Open Top Bus Tours from Times Sq for $49 over 2 days is a great way to see the city
315,1778,"Jul 18 2005	You know how to take the reservation but not how to hold the reservation	Long review, but worth reading before you make your reservation...Back in April (2 1/2 months before our arrival date), we reserved two double rooms at the Comfort Inn Midtown for 3 adults and 3 children (reserved on ChoiceHotels). When we arrived at the hotel in July, we were told that there were no double rooms available because the hotel was undergoing renovations. (We didn't see any signs of renovations during our stay.)The front desk clerk offered to put us into two rooms, each with one Queen bed and a cot. We said this would be OK, but only if we were charged the rate that was advertised the previous evening on ChoiceHotels for this room type and date ($55 less per room than the rate we were quoted for our double rooms). He said he could only offer us a 10% discount ($14 less per room). He offered to walk us down the street to another hotel if we didn't want these rooms. We said this was unacceptable since we had to get ready to go see a show in a couple of hours. We then called Choice Hotels Customer Service (CHCS) using the front desk phone.I told the CHCS clerk about what had happened. He asked me if the hotel had offered to pay for our rooms at the other hotel. I told him that they hadn't. He then put my call on hold and contacted the hotel to get more information. The office manager told him that they had one double room available and that they had told us this. When the CHCS clerk came back to my call, he told me this and I informed him that this was not true. I told him I was fine with having only one double room, but only if the single room was at the same discounted rate as listed on the web site the previous evening. He put me on hold and contacted the hotel again and discussed this with the office manager. She spoke loudly and sounded very agitated. After their call, my call with the CHCS clerk was cut off. The office manager said it didn't matter, since the CHCS clerk would just tell me that there was only one double room available and the other room would be only $14 less.Again, I said this was unacceptable and asked her to reconnect me to CHCS. She then told me that they had two double rooms available. She said that we would need to pay $12 extra per person though. We said that we would not pay any extra charges than those on the printed copy of our reservation. She did not seem happy this response, but proceeded to check us in. She said something like &quot;I thought you would have been more understanding, but I guess you don't want to work with me&quot;. I thought it was very unprofessional for an office manager to behave this way while other customers were in the lobby, overhearing this entire fiasco.Because our check-in process was so disastrous (about 20 minutes), none of us enjoyed our stay at the hotel. We would definitely warn others not to stay at this hotel, based on our experience, plus other reviews we've read since then. Make sure to check out other reviews with low ratings. Several of them describe very similar stories. There are several other nice hotels in the same area and price range, so make sure to choose your hotel wisely.When we filed a formal complaint with CHCS, we were told that someone in upper management of the hotel would contact us within 7 days. It has been 2 weeks now and we still haven't received a call from anyone at the hotel."
316,1778,"Jul 18 2005	Excellent! Recommend to eveyone	Stayed in the comfort inn midtown, with my boyfriend. Being students we didn't have a great deal to spend on a hotel so we thought that the Comfort Inn sounded reasonable. I wasn't sure what to expect, but as we entered our room we were really pleased with what we saw. The room was sparkling and was cleaned everyday. The staff were really friendly and couldn't do enough to help. The situation of the hotel couldn't be better. Just a stones throw from Times Square, Empire State Building, Macy's and 5th Avenue all within short walking distance. Once we left I realised I had left my wash bag at the hotel, full of brand new and unused Clinique products and MAC makeup, which I never thought I would see again. The next day my cousin went to the hotel on my behalf to enquire about my bag, to our surprise had been handed in by the maid, containing the full contents. This alone is a reason to stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown. It really put the icing on the cake for my boyfriend and I and made our trip to the city a happy memory."
317,1778,"Jul 17 2005	STAY AT THIS HOTEL!	OK, I just returned from NYC and the very first thing I am doing is to let everyone know that the previous reviews were right on the mark. We spent three nights here and the place was far and away the best value you will find within miles of Times Square. We (me, wife, 19 y.o., 17 y.o.) stayed in one of their eight double-double rooms. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet, if you don't count the occasional bells of the beautiful church next door! The bathroom was much bigger than expected and the towels were great, despite some previous postings to the contrary. The staff was nothing short of fabulous, especially Dioris and Jovanni behind the counter, and Sidibi and Kenneth, the bellmen. We got there far too early to be checked in, so they took our luggage and stored it securely for us, while we went out and explored. They even pointed out that a festival was going on down on 6th Avenue (away from Times Square) and we should check it out. I know big hotels will do things such as this, but a budget hotel on Times Square? They also knew lots of little secrets and are more than willing to share with you, if you ask.The hallways are incredibly narrow, but also very well-lit. You never once felt as though the place was old and dingy. The elevator was indeed slower than it should be, but with only 80 rooms, we never waited more than a minute or two, and that was rarely. Be careful, though. The elevator door closes so fast that it can smack into you pretty hard if you are not paying attention. Make sure you are holding it with your hand or that someone has the button pushed for you. They have free continental breakfast, which was simply muffins, donuts, cereal, and fruit. But seriously, how much more do you need in NYC? You don't go there to have great breakfasts. We ate quickly and then went out and did what we wanted. The only thing that I will ask them to change when I send in my review to them is to adjust the pressure on the door closers in each room. If you are trying to sleep and the neighbors are not considerate when entering/exiting their room, the door slams shut loudly. The good news is that each hall is divided in half by the elevator shaft, so you really only have about six rooms in your half of the hallway to be disturbed by. They have a computer with internet access in the business center so that those of us who don't want to haul around one on vacation can still check email and weather reports, etc. You can even print out (for free) maps of todays destinations, subways, whatever. Parking was a relative bargain at $20 per day. It is just across the street, about 1/4 block away.I'll sum up by saying this: I will stay in this hotel again the next time I am in NYC. I will not look for a better deal because there is not one to be had."
318,1778,"Jul 14 2005	I would recommend this hotel for the value and service.	Although the front desk female attendant in the evening was talking on the phone with her friend while checking me into a room, the rest of the staff were very friendly particular the bell men. They were very helpful. In addition the maid and housekeeping were also attentive. The value of the room was also impressive. Marble bathroom floors, decorative furniture, right price, excellent locationa and a friendly staff...what else could you ask for.I will come back again to stay in this fine Hotel.A+++++++++"
319,1778,"Jul 12 2005	A pleasant surprise	My stay was for 2 nights--17th/18th March 2005.My room was clean with two single beds--booking was only for one person. Check in was quick, and a room was ready--even at 11 AM.The location is GREAT--so close to everywhere.The &quot;homely&quot; little breakfast room--just off the lobby--was nice, with plenty of everything, to start your day off well.If, this Australian traveller--ever gets back to New York City, again. I would NOT hesitate to book at the Comfort Inn, again. D.T. Brisbane Australia"
320,1778,"Jul 10 2005	Worked for us!	We had a very pleasant stay here. I chose this hotel based on the reviews on this site and write-ups in a couple of travel books. Everyone's comments proved to be very accurate. The hotel is 1/2 block east of Times Square directly across the street from the very hip looking Muse Hotel. The street is quiet and we did not have any problems with security. In short, the location can't be beat. Great access to several subway stations gets you wherever you want to go in minutes, theater district is just a few blocks away, Radio City right around the corner, MOMA a couple of blocks past that. Many restaurants are within walking distance. You could walk to Grand Central if you weren't lugging bags. The hotel is very clean, the staff quite pleasant. The wi-fi worked perfectly. Breakfast is included, served in a small room off the lobby, and it is simple (bagels, doughnuts, dry cereals, fruit), but plenty to get you on your way in the morning. This is a small homey-type hotel, the photos on the web site make it look larger than it is. There is a small sitting area and window seat in the lobby, the front desk, a small exercise room, computer room and meeting room. The lobby is very clean and nicely renovated. I believe there are only 8 guest floors, with maybe 12 or so rooms on each floor. There is only one elevator, but we did not experience the excessively long waits that other reviewers have described. Our room was on the 5th floor, and it was an easy walk to take the stairs instead if we wanted. The room itself was quite small, maybe 10x12 feet? with a Queen bed, nightstand, small desk, small armoire with TV. The view out the window was of the brick wall of the next building, it would probably be nicer to choose one of the front rooms if you can. Each room has a window-mounted A/C unit - and this was our biggest complaint, it was very loud when on hi speed, somewhat less noisy when on its lowest setting. The bathroom was relatively large considering the bedroom size, and very nice, tiled all around with a pedestal sink, toilet, tub/shower. The towels are rather thin. Soap and shampoo/conditioner combo are provided, other than that, you'll need to bring your own toiletries.At the end of our stay, we checked out in the morning and checked our bags with the doorman until we were ready to leave later in the afternoon. When we returned to collect the bags, one of the people at the front desk called to me and told me I had left something in my room. I was very pleasantly surprised that she knew me by sight and room number as she handed my camera charger to me.I am normally a more luxury-oriented traveler, so I was concerned about choosing a &quot;value&quot; hotel. If you're the same way, but are willing to forego some of the amenities, this is a great choice. When it came right down to it, we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. The breakfast was a nice bonus, the location was fantastic and you can't beat the price -- we were able to happily spend our money instead on fun things like show tickets, etc. -- all in all, it worked great for us. P.S. If you are a AAA member, show your card when you check in. We were given $10 additional off the rate I had already booked with a AAA discount."
321,1778,"Jul 7 2005	Fit all of our needs for a NYC hotel	Booked this hotel for 7 nights in June based on tripadvisor and couldn't be more pleased that we did. We were a little concerned that an inexpensive Manhattan hotel ($143 plus tax) might not be clean or well maintained but our concerns were swept away. The bathroom was spacious and modernized with a great shower/tub with good pressure, tile floors, upgraded faucets, hair dryer, and cleaned immaculately every day with fresh towels, soap, etc. The queen bed was comfortable, sheets changed daily, had a large TV but no time to watch, and an effective air conditioner. Large walkin closet and ample drawers. Small quibble-only one side of bed had a reading lamp. Window looked out onto a wall which was OK because who goes to NY to look out hotel window? Advantage as it also meant very quiet. I am a light sleeper but had no trouble having full night's sleep every night. Included breakfast featured bagels, donuts, two cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, two juices, toast, coffee, tea and even machine brewed espresso. This saved time and money finding a breakfast restaurant in expensive NYC. I thought I would use the small exercise room (treadmills, exercise bicycle), but because of the central location, we walked most places and didn't need the extra exercise. Highly recommended for budget travellers!"
322,1778,"Jul 4 2005	great value clean 	For the price, this was a super hotel. Not quite excellent, but I didn't expect excellent for ~240 (incl. tax) per night in NYC.Room was clean, bathroom was good-sized for NYC with a good shower. The hotel was quiet, surprising for midtown, and the service was pleasant. Absolutely no view and not much room to walk around in the room itself, but those are very minor quibbles.Location can't be beat. I booked the hotel on the recommendations of other posts here, and I wasn't disappointed. In fact, we're going to stay there again in August."
323,1778,"Jun 30 2005	Fabulous Budget Hotel	Booked this hotel for a week in June after reading other reviews on this site. It was exactly as we expected, and we were very satisfied. Not the Ritz, but who wants to pay for that when you're out sightseeing all day anyway? Would stay there again.Pros:-Perfect Location (close to: Times Sq., theatre dist, Rockefeller Ctr, metro stops)-Comfortable rooms (small, but adequate)-Very clean -Great customer service-Free continental breakfast was very good-Did I mention the location?Cons: (If you can call them that, they were *not* a big deal)-No onsite bar or restaurant (Lounge at hotel across the street is cool)-Slow elevator (So, take the stairs)-A/C a bit loud (At least there is air conditioning!)-No view (Only in the room at night to sleep anyway)"
324,1778,"Jun 30 2005	Excellent choice	I can easily rate the Comfort Inn as excellent on all fronts, however I know there is another level of Hotels in NYC, so I will stop at 4 stars. If the prices are in your budget, stay there.Service was great, the people were really nice. We arrived at 11:00 and got the room straight away, which was small, but very comfortable with a great bathroom (room 600). They helped with directions and some bandaids when we needed them. When we left they let us stay until 13:15 as our flights were not 'till 15:00. Works for me.You will be 1 block from Time Square and right in the middle of Manhatten so if you want to get uptown or downtown, you are half way there. If you need a good cheap lunch, turn left out of the hotel and it is five or six down on the right."
325,1778,"Jun 27 2005	Well worth checking out	What a find! In researching a hotel for a group attending a conference in Times Square, it was my mission to get the &quot;best bang for the buck&quot;. I went directly to tripadvisor &amp; locked into the Comfort Inn Midtown immediately. The location is excellent (1/2 block out of Times Square), the rooms are small...but spotless. The bedding was great, the bathroom was clean and well kept, and the noise (except for the air conditioner) was minimal. Breakfast room was clean, well stocked and had a nice variety of goodies. Listen, for $150/night in NYC - this hotel is a gem!!!!"
326,1778,"Jun 23 2005	Very Clean	This hotel is steps away from all the action of Time Square. To my convience this hotel is two blocks from the Belasco Theater. I paid about $179.00 a night, which is a wonderful deal for Midtown. The hotel rooms are very clean. The rooms are also very small; the rooms are big enough to fit a queen size bed, a nice size entertainment system, and a table with chair. Each room has a private bathroom with shower and tub. The room also had a head dryer, coffe maker, air, iron and ironing board; which is great for those that like to pack lite. There's nine floors to this hotel with only one elevator. I didn't fid this to be a problem at all, because the hotel is pretty small."
327,1778,"Jun 22 2005	Good bargain near Times Square	Stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown for the first time. I was a bit reluctant to book this hotel because of the awfully low price of $159, however was pleasantly surprised at the great location, hospitality and cleanliness the hotel has to offer. I would not recommend this hotel for families as the rooms are a bit small. Overall was a good experience and definitely would stay there again."
328,1778,Jun 17 2005	Great place to stay	Myself and 25year old son stayed at the comfort Inn on Jan 2005 for six nights. This hotel was excellent its in a great location just a short walk on to Times Square and handy for site seeing in New York. I asked for a queit room which l got no view looking onto a gable wall but l didnt care as long as you got a nights sleep and it was a queit room. Very clean and towels changed every day. Breakfast was a bonus too which was a good start to the day. Reasonablly priced for New York hotels. Would stay again at this hotel.
329,1778,"Jun 16 2005	Best Kept Secret	I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown for 5 days in June. I booked this hotel based on the reviews on this site and I'm happy that I did. This hotel is the best kept secret in Manhattan. The location is perfect as it's on a side street away from the hustle &amp; bustle of Times Square but close enough and within walking distance to everything. If you're traveling alone or with a partner this is a great hotel to stay. However, if you're traveling with children or large groups I would recommend staying at a hotel with much bigger rooms as the rooms are small here and they do not offer rollaways. The front desk staff were courteous and friendly and the bellman was terrific. Although there is only one elevator I never had to wait long. My room had a queen size bed and bath/shower so I must have lucked out and got one of the bigger rooms. The room was always neat and tidy. Although breakfast is offered between 7-10 if you miss it there are plenty of eateries close to the hotel. If you're arriving from JFK I would recommend taking one of the shuttles to the hotel this way you can see a little of NY and will only cost $17 instead of the $45 for a taxicab ride. Also, when I left for the airport I used the car service that the hotel provides. For about the same amount of money to take a cab I opted for the ride to JFK in a nice A/C luxury vehicle and it was worth every cent. Just ask the bellman or the front desk and they will set it up for you. I have to say my stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown was the best and I would highly recommend this to family and friends. I will definitely stay at this hotel again."
330,1778,"Jun 16 2005	TripAdvisor is right on the money!	Read reviews here before choosing Comfort Inn Midtown, and I am glad I did! We had a wonderful stay! The location and price cannot be beat! It is right across from the Muse Hotel, which I understand is pricier!Room we had was nice, clean and quiet. Room was smaller and narrower than what I'm accustomed to...so were the hallways and stairway, but I was mentally prepared for that.All the staff were very friendly....who said New Yorkers were rude?You are right on W46th which is called Little Brazil...and on the other side of Broadway, it's Restaurant Row! W 47th is Diamond Row, and all the theaters are all within nice walking distance. You can also walk to 5th Avenue from here and shop till you drop, and have access to other major tourist attractions (Grand Central station, Rockefeller center, etc.) You are also next to a church...and those church bells in the morning are actually quite comforting!Check out the little Cuban restaurant across the street! Oh, and there's a manicure/pedicure place a couple of doors down for a quick makeover before a show.Don't expect wide open spaces, swimming pools, etc. This is a nice place to come home to after a full day of exploring NYC."
331,1778,"Jun 14 2005	Great value and location	This was my first stay at the Comfort Inn (June 4-11) and I was very pleased. The hotel is clean, staff members are friendly and helpful, free high-speed internet is provided in the lobby, and the continental breakfast was excellent and food plentiful. In addition, the hotel is conveniently located about 1/2 block from Times Square. The room was rather small and plain, but very clean and well-maintained. I have stayed in &quot;budget&quot; hotels before in New York, and this one has been, by far, the best. For $139/night, I cannot think of a better bargain for your dollar. I will definitely stay at this hotel again the next time I am in New York."
332,1778,"Jun 7 2005	Very good hotel small but clean and close to all the action...	We stayed there for 4 nights and found it a very good hotel. Small but clean rooms, not a great view but very quiet. Elevator is slow, we took the stairs sometimes. The price was reasonable for NYC and the breakfast was free. Very close to Time Square and other attractions. We would definitely stay there again."
333,1778,"Jun 6 2005	A Great Little Hotel	After spending weeks on this site searching for good hotels for my first visit to NYC, I chose the Comfort Inn Midtown. I stayed here on 5/31 through 6/2. Yeah it's small, but it's quaint and cozy with Times Square just footsteps away. The room was very clean with no blemishes on the towels, carpeting or room/bathroom fixtures. I had a great time here and will definitely stay here again for my next trip to NYC."
334,1778,"Jun 5 2005	Did the job!	When travelling on a budget, particularly to somewhere like Manhattan, it is very easy to find most of your precious dollars swallowed up by accommodation. By staying at the Comfort Inn, my wife and I had more money in our pocket to go out and enjoy the city - which after all, is what it is all about! Our 7-night stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown in May, while having no outstanding features, was comfortable and trouble-free; in other words, it did the job we wanted of it, and it did it admirably!Our expectations of the hotel - and our reasons for choosing it - were based on the reviews here. I guess we expected something a little run-down (but not too much), somewhat noisy at the front, perhaps occasional problems with the cleanliness of the bathrooms or linen. A few reviews suggested that some people found staff to be a little unfriendly or brusque, and that the breakfast provided &quot;ran out&quot; if you weren't there early enough. So we figured that at worst the hotel may be a little unpleasant, but for $130 a night we could live with that.It was a pleasant surprise then, when even our minor apprehensions were proven to be dead wrong. The room was clean and seemed quite new. Despite the fact that we had a 5th floor room at the front (after a check-in request for &quot;something quieter&quot; than the 2nd floor room at the front we were booked in to), we slept soundly through each night without any problems. The towels and bathroom were clean and fresh each day. The breakfast, while a little bland by the 7th morning, was plentiful (though glazed doughnuts for breakfast?!) And most importantly, the staff were out-going and helpful at all times.Best Points:* THE PRICE!* The location - although given the efficiency of the subway, next time I'd be tempted to take an even-cheaper outer boroughs hotel that was next to a subway station.* Room size was much larger than expected - a good 80cm on either side of the queen bed, and at least 1.5m between the foot of the bed and the TV cabinet.* Free internet access - a nice bonus.* Free newspapers at breakfast (if early enough)Not so good points:* No fridge in the room - I guess we assumed there would be one, and had plans to get groceries for lunch and some of our dinners. A fridge can be arranged, but costs an extra $10 per night. No thanks: we ate out.* Slow lift - unless the lift was already at our floor, the only time we waited for it was for luggage. When going down 4 floors, the steps were often faster than the lift.* Toilet often required a couple of flushes, and even blocked once; but was promptly fixed after we asked at reception.But really, these are minor quibbles. None of them produced more than transitory annoyances. For where it was (and compared to the reviews of other Manhattan hotels in the price range), the Comfort Inn Midtown was wonderful.The bottom line: would I stay there again? As I mentioned earlier, better-than-expected public transport would have us looking a little further out next time; but if we stay in Manhattan in future (even when we have a little more to spend) we will be staying at the Comfort Inn Midtown!"
335,1778,"Jun 2 2005	Above Average	My husband and I stayed at the Comfort Inn, Midtown in New York City from May 16 through May 20, 2005. Although the hotel is very small, it was very neat and clean. The lobby was decorated beautifully, and the staff was very, very nice and accomodating. A short walk to the corner landed us right in the middle of Times Square which was in our opinion the right place to be to catch our tour busses, etc. I would recommend the Comfort Inn, Midtown to travelers who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars per day on a hotel room. We will definitely stay there again."
336,1778,"Jun 1 2005	Not a fan of the comfort inn midtown	My 2 girlfriends and I went to New York City for a shopping getaway. We wanted to stay close to Times Square and not pay too much, so we chose the comfort inn. Location was good. However, when we arrived, they had booked us with only 2 people, instead of 3, and informed us that there were only single/full size beds available and that they have no roll-away-beds! So, one of us had to sleep on the hard-as-a-rock floor in a tiny little room. We were informed that we would get extra blankets for the person sleeping on the floor, although we only received 2 extra (not enough to make the foor even somewhat comfortable!) Also, there is only one tiny elevator in the whole hotel making it somewhat difficult and long to get up or down, as sometimes you had to wait for several trips before you could get on the elevator. On a good note, the continental breakfast was great.As we were leaving to go back to the airport, we asked the concierge to call us a taxi, as we were waiting in the lobby, they told us our cab was &quot;here&quot; as they literally pushed us out the street and made us walk up to times square with our suit cases to hail a cab ourselves! It was very rude.Not sure I'll be back to the comfort inn on my next stay in NYC!!"
337,1778,"May 27 2005	Great Location clean and safe!	I read all the reviews before I went to this hotel and am happy to say that they were all accurate. The Midtown was clean, safe and a great budget hotel for those that just want a nice spot to sleep and shower. The lobby was clean and the front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast was also great, and just enough to start off your day!The location can't be beat and you are literally just steps away from Times Square and it's only a short walk to Rockerfeller Square and 5th avenue.We would definitely stay here again!!"
338,1778,"May 14 2005	Great value location and clean!	I stayed here for 4 nights in May and was very pleased with the results and am glad that I trusted the reviews on this site. Everything was great... location, cleanliness, staff, continental breakfast and for a great AAA price that you can't beat. If you are not looking for anything fancy and just want a clean, decent place to sleep and shower... this is your place. I would definitely stay here again."
339,1778,May 13 2005 	Great location ...beware if you are claiming AAA discount	This is the second I have stayed here - this time for 4 nights. The location is great and the rooms are tidy and clean. Just beware if you are claiming the AAA discount. I am a NRMA member and was entitled to the AAA discount and they refused to honour it despite numerous calls and faxes from NRMA and AAA. In the end we gave up despite having to pay an extra $160 US.
340,1778,"May 9 2005	Not so sure	The Comfort Inn was comfortable! We were not particularly sure about cleanliness in the lobby when we spotted a cockroach. It may have been a one off having come in from outside. The room felt clean enough but needed a bit of renovation. Also, there were steps up from outside which was really frustrating when arriving tired with threee heavy bags. There was no doorman around to help. Also the hotel is not particularly close to a subway station. We never had breakfast but noticed it was very busy - probably a good sign. Free internet access was a bonus."
341,1778,"May 7 2005	Immaculate and Convenient	My husband and I stayed here for 5 days in May and we would definately stay here again. The entrance is very modest, but the lobby was elegant. Our room was tiny, but in the rear of the building, so very quiet. You would never know you were one block from Times Square. Since our window faced a brick wall, we had to call our friends to actually find out what the weather was for the day. But who cares, we weren't in NY to stay in our room. Everything was immaculately clean, nothing was in disrepair, the bathroom had a tub and great shower. Breakfast donuts weighed a pound a piece, delicious and free. Everyone was friendly and the price was just right.We never did figure out the radiator heating system, but it wasn't cold, so it didn't matter. All in all, we were very happy with the Comfort Inn."
342,1778,May 3 2005	Great Hotel	My 11 year old daughter and I stayed here 3 nights in April. We came for a mother daughter getaway. I researched the hotels near time Square on trip Advisor before making a decision..and it proved to be very helpful. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. rooms were extremely clean. The 1st night we had a room with a view of the brick building next door. The room was relatively small but we expected that. the only downfall was no bathtub. On our way out that evening I asked if all the rooms only contained a shower. I was told no only 2 of them. I asked if it was possible to switch rooms as i knew the hotel was sold out. I also asked about a corner room as I had requested it originally. They offered to move me to one in a.m. With warning that it would be noisy as it was on the street side. my daughter prefeered it as she loves the noise of NY. We were moved to a room 2x the size of previous one. The rest of our stay proved just as enjoyable. looking forward to returning
343,1778,May 2 2005	Very Comfortable At Comfort Inn!!!	What a pleasant surprise this hotel was. Excellent location and a staff better than many found at pricier sites. Breakfast buffet was fresh-room was immaculate--and I had a tub-so what more do I need?! A few steps to the right and you are in Times Square-go to the left about a block down and 46th street becomes known as Brasil Row-fabulous restaurants-then walk a little further and you are on 5th avenue. I was never scared and as a female travelling alone in NYC-that is no small thing. The hotel stowed my bags and arranged for my ride to LGA in the late afternoon-effortless and I was able to squeeze in some last minute shopping. Don't pass up this gem whether on business or pleasure-your company will be glad you saved them $$ and if it is on your nickel-you will have more for shopping and EATING!@
344,1778,"May 1 2005	Good for the money	For the money this place can't be beat. It is far from perfect but it is clean and very convenient. The staff is friendly and the breakfast adequate (and free). They provide free internet access (if you can hook up). They have DSL, but it's so slow that in 6 days we were only able to access our email twice! It just times out before connecting, and unless you have a lot of time, it's worthless. The rooms are rather small and the bathroom was really dark - could have used some higher intensity lights. It's hard to do make up in a dark bathroom, believe me, I have stayed in a lot worse for a lot more! Can't complain for the price ($125.00 mid week) we didn't spend much time in the room anyway - I would definitely stay there again."
345,1778,"Apr 30 2005	Fantastico Location	I stayed here 11th Nov for 5 nights, i was in NY for a birthday treat with my mother, and after a lot of consideration we chose this hotel.I could not fault it on anything, the rooms were clean, the staff were friendly and the buffet breakfast was fab. Yes the room did get a bit overcrowded, but when you consider what a rare thing it is to get breakfast included in New York, is it that surprising??Yes the rooms were smaller than average, but its New York, why would you be in your room for long enough for the size to bother you??All in all i would stay here again without a doubt, and i would not hesitate to reccommend it to anyone - i thought it was fantastic, and the location could not have been more perfect."
346,1778,"Apr 17 2005	Great hotel	I checked trip advisor before booking this hotel for a week in the city. Really glad I did as the reviews are so honest and accurate. When we arrived we were told we would be in a front room and these rooms were generally quite noisy. We were offered another room straight away if we wanted or we could try it out and change the following day if we prefered. We took the 2nd option and yes, you could hear the noise from the street (even at 4am) but we thought the room itself was such a great size we were reluctant to move. I guess, we must be sound sleepers because the noise didn't bother us at all in the end although I'm sure it could really bother others. Everything else was great. Fantastic location, very clean bedrooms and bathrooms, comfy bed, great breakfasts and free internet. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and will hopefully be back someday."
347,1778,"Apr 13 2005	Great motel for the price	We stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown Apirl 8-11. We picked this location after reading reviews on this website and we were not disappointed. It's nothing fancy, but it's affordable and it's in the perfect location. We arrived at noon and they had our room ready so we could check in early. The room is the smallest thing I've ever stayed in, but from reading reviews I knew not to expect anything big. The bathroom was decent size so that was nice. Again...if you are looking for something affordable and in the perfect location, this is the place to stay. Remember they take AAA, so you get a nice discount on rooms by presenting your card!"
348,1778,"Apr 11 2005	Lives up to all the reviews!	We fully endorse all the positive reviews on this site. A great find - great location near Times Square, clean and bright room, all staff friendly and free Internet access and breakfast. Would certainly stay here again."
349,1778,"Apr 9 2005	Great Location/Non-smoking/Non-smelly	We generally stay at 3 star hotels now. After reading reviews on the more expensive hotels I was not ready to spend extra money on a hotel that I was barely going to stay in. Some of the reviews on the 3 stars were actually scary. I down graded to a two star with excellent ratings. We seemed to spend a little more than most people here at $160. a night. What I really enjoyed about this hotel was that it was a non-smoking hotel. So many times even if you stay in a non-smoking room the lobby and halls of older hotels have an off odor to them. This was not noted at this hotel, I think, because of this policy. We were located in the back on the 7th floor corner room. Did not notice any noise except when it rained one night it came down onto the air condition unit and was kind of loud. Not unbearable. The couch in the lobby was tattered. I think it was an antique. I wasn't sure what I would find in the rooms but found everything said on this forum to be true. Clean rooms. Clean white towels. Maid service everyday. Family used the breakfast room and was satisfied until lunch came. We were out of our rooms by 9 am every morning and back shortly after dinner to get ready to go out again for the evening. Everything was always put back together after our rush of showers.We had a room that had the bathroom tiled. It was a small 3 inch step that all of us tripped over a couple of times. Bathroom was clean, no mold visible and new soap put out everyday. Rooms weren't especially pretty, but location was great. Would stay here again. My sixteen year old could watch all the TV he wanted and they seemed to have the sports channels for games available.I used the down stairs computer to print out our boarding passes the night before we left. Also, the morning of I checked our flight to make sure it was on time. Some hotels will charge for this service at this hotel it was free. Could have checked our email as it never seemed to be occupied. But hey we were on vacation and all could wait for our return."
350,1778,"Apr 8 2005 	Be Careful	I stayed here for three nights the first week of April. Be careful of the prices they charge! When I made my reservation, I was quoted a price and then when I arrived they charged me $15 a night more because they claimed my discount was no good! After taxes, I ended up paying an extra $75 for the three nights. My room was on the 4th floor. It was tiny but clean when I arrived. The second day I was given towels with make-up on them. It was also noisy. I never had a good night's sleep. You can hear doors slamming all over and also personal hygiene noises from other rooms. The doorman was the only friendly staff member I encountered. I never ate the breakfast so I can't comment on that area. Elevators ran fine---I never had an issue with them---and location is nice. I don't need a fancy or upscale hotel, but I do like cleanliness and quiet.All in all----if you don't care about prices, room size and cleaniness---it would be a good place to stay. If you want to know you'll be charged the correct price, and that your towels will actually be clean---stay somewhere else.I will never stay here again, would never recommend the place, and have informed my company to not recommend it to other employees when they come to town."
351,1778,"Apr 5 2005	We'll Be Back	7 of us stayed here for St. Patricks day just....great stay....nice folks all around and helpful....nice clean rooms, decent continental buffet...Location, Location, Location: we walked to Lion King and Phantom Of The Opera, the parade, St.Patricks, Grand Central Station, most everything...we all agreed we'd stay here next time...even the legendary elevator seemed quite quick enough, thanks!!...And Thanks to Trip Advisor for the tip!!"
352,1778,"Apr 5 2005	you get what you pay for	Just returned from this hotel. Breakfast is great you can always sit in the window seats in the lobby and eat breakfast and watch the world go by if the dining room is full. The staff are excellent especially the lady who was incrediblky friendly and nice throughout the stay. We had a room at the front which was noisy til about 1130 and again at 8 in morning but when in new york was so busy would have slept through anything. Go to Spamalot, La CAge aux Falles, The Opera (there is a fabulous italian opposite the lincoln centre), Go see the knicks, go see jackie mason, book a helicopter ride, thefront desk will give you a discount on bus tours. Enjoy new york. This hotel is cheap, cheerful and incredibly well located."
353,1778,Mar 30 2005	Lovely warm hotel	I loved this hotel very much (in NEW YORK)It was very clean and the people were very lovely and warm We enjoyed it very muchThanks a lot
354,1778,"Mar 27 2005	Can't Say a Bad Thing	Well I feel that I owe this hotel and site a review since it was my main source of info on the hotel before my trip. I booked this hotel 3 months ago for a 3 night stay (march 17-20). I got a rate of $107 a night with AAA. I constantly looked at the site for new reviews to see how this hotel measured up as I thought at $107 a night, how nice could it really be. But after reading consistent good reviews, I decided to give it a shot. And let me say that I am glad that I did.My mother and I went to NYC and just wanted a place that was clean and in a safe neighborhood. We wanted something centrally located and this hotel couldn't have been in a better location. Just yards away from the heart of Times Square and located near theaters and subways, it couldn't have been better. I requested a room with 2 twin beds and on a corner since I heard they were bigger. I was told that they didn't have corner rooms with twin beds, but when we checked in our room seemed significantly bigger than the other rooms on our floor. We were in room 307 which was in the back side of the building. It was a bit hot in the room and we didn't want the heat on or that noisy ac unit, so we opened the window a crack which let in a cool breeze. Let me say that it was like we were in the country. No noise whatsoever...you would never imagine we were only yards from Times Square. The room was kept clean and tidy during our 3 days and everyone was super friendly, especially the breakfast man. (Don't forget to bring some money to tip him). We were lucky and got a table each morning for breakfast, but it seemed to be quite full at the busier times in the morning. There is only one elevator..the only problem I see. But being on the 3rd floor we often walked down the stairs which weren't too bad.All in all this hotel was great and I would definatley recommend it to anyone who is looking to be in the heart of the city, have a clean room, breakfast included and save the money on a room you are never in for the finer things NYC has to offer. Thank you Trip Advisor....may this review help someone else make an informed decision."
355,1778,"Mar 18 2005	Take earplugs!!!!	I have just come back from the Comfort Inn Midtown - I stayed there from 9th March - 16th March 05. Its a good hotel, clean and comfy beds. Goo breakfast, bagels, doughuts, toast, bananas, yoghurts, OJ etc and the man who looks after the breakfast room is so helpful, so dont forget to tip him!If you are unfortunute enough to get a room at the front, allthough it may be roomy, you will need earplugs.The noise at night is horrendous horrendous horrendous. At times I was woken in the night terrified of this loud thunderous noise! But this is also because the hotel is on Times Square which is a NY version of Leister Sqaure - tacky busy and awful. Avoid at all cost Bubb gump Shrimp on Times Square, the service is the worst, the food is in edible and you cant see out the windows for the dirt. A must however is a drink at the Marriot Marquis. The bar/restaurant &quot;The View&quot; is on the 48th Floor and the views are fantatsic. Do not have dinner here though. Its a buffet with the smallest plates and apalling service.The best restaurant is opposite the comfort inn called Le Tre Veneizie. Its the best Italian with excellent customer service - a very rare thing in NY.Sights:Empire State: A busy gift shop with a view. Huge let down.Sky ride: Dont do it. Statue of Liberty: Worth a lookCentral Park: Wonderful if sunny, the Zoo is brilliant, avoid the horse drawn ride, you get 20 mins around the front bit of park for $40, disapointing.Pier 17 &amp; South Street Sea Port: Stop and a have some clam chowder.Brooklyn bridge: A walk with a view - brilliant.New York public Library: Good for 10 mins to kill.Grand central: Loved it. A good affordable place for lunch.Macys: Busy and hot but good bargians: Go to the Visitor counter, show a passport and you get a card giving 11% everything in the store including sale items.For dinner get a cab to Greenwich Village or Little Italy. Overall, New York is an okay place to go for a trip but i would not go back. If you want to go somewhere for a romantic break and eat good food Do Not Go Here. Its a lot of money for an American version of London but without the culture."
356,1778,"Mar 16 2005	The Second Time Around	This is the second time I've stayed at this motel in Times Square. The value and location are terrific for NYC. The staff was again, very helpful and pleasant. The room, though small, was fine. Clean w/ the amenities of pricier motels. I still give it an Above Average rating."
357,1778,Mar 8 2005	OK but not great	Just came back from New York and stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown. Never been to New York before so it's hard to say how the hotel compares to other NY hotels. Everything else was OK but the heating made an irritating noise. I couldn't sleep through the night and woke up quite often. Stayed at the 9th floor.
358,1778,"Mar 5 2005	Wonderful hotel!	What a great place to stay, plain and simple!My girlfriend and I just got back from a 5-night vacation in New York City, and we had stayed at this location. We went there because of price and the positive reviews on this site. I knew that I wanted to minimize my costs in NY while staying at a decent hotel, so this place fit the bill. So, let's get on with this review, and I'll try to detail it as well as possible, since I just got back from there today (it's still fresh in my mind).The lobby area is elegant enough. Nice marble floors give way to the concierge and the dining room, which is used for the abundant breakfast items (nothing fancy, but there are bagels, doughnuts, apples, bananas, various cereals, strawberry yoghurt, and coffee... I'm not sure if I'm missing anything, since I ate there 2 of the 5 nights there only...) There is a small exercise room up the hall a bit, with a treadmill, a bicycle machine, and I believe a stairmaster. Overall, good lobby amenities. Nothing out of the ordinary, but what is there, it's done well.We stayed on the second floor in the back. The view was nothing to write home about, simply facing a brick wall. Beware, as very little light comes through the black-out curtains and the brick walls. We wanted to wake up early and go sight-seeing, but since no real amounts of light made it into the room, we had a hard time getting up, since we were so comfortable and lazy in our cozy bed. Of course, that does ensure that you get a good night's rest, as there is very little noise and light that comes into your room!The room ameneties are excellent for what they are. Quite a large, decent TV, with about 35 channels. A comfortable, queen-size bed. A nice chair and table. Drawers. A beautiful painting hung over the bed. Just little things that you can find in every hotel, and done well here as well. The furniture, as far as I can tell however, was not run down or did not seem that it would break in an instant, a good sign. The bathroom was excellent, having a shower stall and a modern-looking basin. There is a hair dryer in there as well. Water from the shower was good, cold and hot, and the pressure was good.The rooms were kept spotless, which I was thankful for. Clean towels every day. Clean sheets every day. Amenities replaced as needed, such as new soap bars. Vacuumed every day. It was wonderful, because I cannot live without cleanliness. I've heard horror stories about some other hotels, and I'm glad this isn't one of them.The cleaning lady was one of the sweetest lady I've ever met. You'll know her when you see her. She is so sweet, in that little accent of hers, telling us when our room would be ready again, and always greeting us warmly whenever she saw us. This was a nice touch, especially when you meet lots of people in the city who are too rushed or care too little for niceties. This warmthness also extended to some of the staff members, but she was definitely the person that stuck out in my head. Oh, and so is the guy who encourages you to eat breakfast heartily. He just keeps encouraging to take food! He was also a nice guy.Staff at the front were friendly and helpful for the one time I asked for help, and that was how to take the subway to get to the airport. So I can't really comment on that. They seemed generally friendly though, always ready to answer questions that you had.Overall, a great value hotel. Clean rooms are important to me, and this had them. Oh yes, and there was plenty of space to move freely around the room. It's not a big room, but it's a big-enough room to be comfortable enough. I loved it here, and will most definitely stay here again. Highly recommended."
359,1778,"Feb 28 2005	Excellent do not hesitate to book if you're budgeting!	I used this website for guidance before booking the hotel, so I feel that it's only fair to post my opinions here!Simple as this: If you're doing New York on a low to mid-size budget, you simply cannot go wrong with this hotel. The location is perfect - a 20 yard stroll and you're in Times Square. It's in a great position for all of the main attractions (Empire State, Guggenheim, Central Park and all the main shopping districts are within 10 minutes walk) and conveniently placed for the subway to other areas. There's an excellent choice of Deli's and restaraunts around the hotel (Check out the Guinness in the Irish bar next door!)As for the hotel....well, It's pretty good, even aside from the location. Yes, the rooms are small. But what do you expect for $99 per night - a butler?! The bed was very comfortable, the shower was hot and it was clean, tidy and pleasant. Internet access was free downstairs and there was a small selection of exercise machines downstairs (No-one mentioned this!!!)The breakfast is a big bonus. There are doughnuts, bagels, rolls, fruit, yogurt, cereals and tea\coffee, apple and orange juice. I don't know what people are complaining about - there's loads, I found the service friendly and it was the perfect way to start the day. Not many New York hotels offer breakfast, it's a real benefit.Staff are friendly, helpful and polite. We were able to check in an hour early, and they kept our bags for us on the day we checked out.Look, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel. If you want the lap of luxury - sure, there's much better hotels. But you will pay for them - and how!!! For the price, this is perfect, you will not go wrong.I scoured every review on here before I booked, and was naturally suspicious of all the praise being heaped on what was a very cheap hotel. There is no need to be. Everything people say is true, and you cannot go wrong with this place if you are budgeting!!!!Save $100 per night and spend it on shopping!!!!!!"
360,1778,"Feb 21 2005	Great location room was superb would stay again	I booked this hotel in July and watched the tripadvisor reviews constantly until we arrived. We stayed six nights, Feb 11-16th. This hotel was everything the reviews stated. Room was clean, spacious since we had a corner room. The view outside the window was not so exciting but who cares, we were seldom in our room. The bathroom was spacious for two and always clean towels, fresh soap, etc.Internet worked fine, no problems there. Television was great. The heat was somewhat warm but all you had to do was turn down the radiator.Desk staff were great. Rojo always had a smile and was willing to help. We never ate the continental breakfast, the tables were always full and we didn't want to wait around. So can't comment on that.Talk about close to Times Square, you couldn't ask for anything closer or more convenient.If we ever get the opportunity to go to NYC again, we'll stay at this hotel. We went into the Plaza Suite and didn't feel near as welcome as this hotel.Thanks tripadvisor!"
361,1778,"Feb 16 2005	Perfect for the Budget Conscience	Booked this hotel for our first trip to New York. Perfect location near Times Square and Subways. Clean rooms and plenty big... although we had a corner room which I read were bigger. Shower had great water pressure, and we never had problems with our heat, like other reviewers had mentioned. The free breakfast was great... bagels, doughnuts, apples, bananas, cereal, coffee, juice... I would definitely stay here again... You can't beat the price!"
362,1778,"Feb 15 2005	A Great Choice	I am almost reluctant to write this review, as I don't want this hotel to become too busy to accomodate in the great fashion that they do. The room was a corner room, plenty large for 2 people and nicely updated. Of course there was street noise, but we requested a room facing the street. There was a very sufficient computer and printer for customer use, along with a nice little exercise room, if you have energy left after enjoying New York City. We were always up and gone duing breakfast time, so I can't comment on that. The staff was more than helpful, and the ride they arranged to the JFK was $45 for 2 people! We will definitely stay again!"
363,1778,"Feb 15 2005	Perfect place to stay	Me and my daugther stayed here for four nights in February, and I must say this was a perfect choice. Not only for the location, but the hotel itself. I had read some nice reviews here on tripadvisor, so I expected it to be a good place to stay, but even so I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the hotel is really clean and with nice furniture, colors, nicely decorated etc. Looks very fresh and I believe its renovated not so long ago. We had a corner room which is a bit larger than the others so we we're lucky. The TV was a big one and right in front of the beds. The room was on 7th floor and not facing the street, so the noice was a minimum and sleeping was excellent (nice firm beds too). The room was big enough and also the bathroom. Even in cold february the room was warm, and we just put the (noisy) a/c machine on for a few minutes every morning to get some fresh (New York...) air. The cleaningwomen and the man in the breakfast room were very friendly to us, some of the staff at the desk could be more helpful though (we had to complain a few times about the Internet not working and the reaction was barely visible...)Breakfast was great, with bagels, cereals, donuts and lots of fresh fruit. Free coffee whenever we wanted all day. All in all, I think this hotel gives great value for the money (which for us was 100 dollar per night plus taxes) with of course unbeatable location really close to Times Square. I really can recommend this hotel to anyone coming to New York. I have stayed in other hotels in New York but this was by far the best value for money."
364,1778,"Feb 14 2005	great price and location	the hotel, while small, gives an european air upon arrival. We got there at 10 a.m. and just expected to leave our luggage since check in time was not til 3pm. they gave us a room right away. the staff was so friendly. the room was small but clean. the bed and pillows were outstanding. we had to turn on the a/c the room was so warm but it also helped drown out any noise from below.the location was the best. right outside was times square. we forgot our cord for the high speed interntet access and they loaned up one.the breakfast was more than adequate.this hotel is a find in nyc."
365,1778,"Feb 14 2005	Good value.....great price.....excellent location	Booked a room here based on Trip Advisor reviews, which proved to be quite accurate.The location is outstanding. You can't get any closer to all the great sights in NYC. The rooms are small, which is to be expected, but nicely furnished and extremely clean. I don't normally check for cleanliness if everything looks OK, but I lost the remote for the TV somewhere in the room, so I searched everywhere before finding it under the nightstand....the rooms are very, very clean.As previously posted, there is a sticker on the window saying not to open it. Well, I like fresh air, so I gave it a try, and it would fully open. I asked at the front desk about the sticker, and was told it is because pigeons tend to fly into the rooms with open windows, as there is no screening.About 99% of what has been written in other reviews is accurate...the breakfast, doors closing, etc. I will add that I was on the 7th floor, west side, which is right next to a church. For whatever reason, the church bells would go off during the day at strange times. Not as if it was an hourly event, but I could never understand why the bells were ringing....it was not a function of time. Perhaps church services or something, but never a problem.It is a 15 minute walk to the hotel from the airport express bus drop at Grand Central Station (the best way to get in from LGA or JFK). I would most definitely stay there again. Great price, great location, quality room, free wi-fi, free breakfast."
366,1778,"Feb 6 2005	A gem I'm glad I found	My first time at this hotel but it won't be the last. The satff were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean, comfortable and warm with a great bathroom fitted with a super shower. The noise insulation of the next room's plumbing could be improved and there was no view out of the window - but who goes to New York to sit in the hotel room and look at the view! There is only one lift which meant a short wait sometimes. The complimentary breakfast was first class and plenty of it. The hotel's location on 46th Street location couldn't be better - Times square and subway station at the end of the street, less than a minute's walk away. Restaurants aboud in the area. Value for money, this hotel can't be beaten and I'll certainly be using it again."
367,1778,"Jan 27 2005	Great Value for money.	I booked in to this hotel because of its reviews on Trip Advisor.We (boyf+I) for 10 nights, 11 jan to 21st Jan. Rooms spotlessly clean. Serviced every day with fresh towels, bins emptied etc. We had a room at a corner and it was definately bigger than the room beside us which wasnt. so ask for room on a corner. Oh Location location Location!! time square is only 10 door steps away. subway on 42nd or 49th! Breakfast was also a bonus. It was cereal, juice, toast, bagel, donut and friut. as much as you like. Staff were helpful when needed. A little noisey out side but ..it is the city that never sleeps after all.I wouldn't hesitate in reccomending this hotel to others."
368,1778,"Jan 26 2005	Comfort Inn great price...which counts for a lot.	Stayed for 3 nights this week just past. They allowed us an early check-in and the attendent was extrememly pleasant...we even got a smile despite what some other reviewers have written! The room was okay...nothing spectacular, but then what should we have been expecting?! The heating was terrible! Absolutely terrible! We had to get an employee to bring in a space heater for us which helped but was an eyesore and nuisance for the feet given the size of the room. We were at the front on the 3rd floor and were warned that it would be noisy...we had no trouble sleeping at all.The breakfast consisted of some not so fresh bread (may as well have been a brick), donuts and powdery fruit. But hey, it was free! Go elsewhere for breakfast, it's worth the investment.The location was awesome. The hotel is a stones throw from Times Square, the half price ticket booth, subway and Broadway. We probably will invest in a higher grade hotel next time. But if you are on a budget, this is a pretty sizable bang for your buck."
369,1778,"Jan 26 2005	Couldn't ask for more	Would highly recommend this hotel, stayed for 4 nights. We were lucky enough to get a corner room which was bigger than the others. Room was very comfortable, was like being in your own bedroom at home. Bathroom very clean also. Breakfast was more than adequate and we had no fault with any of the staff. But the thing that really sells this hotel is Location Location Location!!! Times Square it virtually on it's door step, with 5th Avenue and Rockerfeller Centre and Radio City a few blocks away. I would not recommend the TFI Fridays on the corner of Times Square but can highly recommend the Europa Cafe (at the door of the hotel, take a left and it's at the end of the street). It does great burritos and juices. The information centre in Times Square also sells reduced price theatre tickets if you don't want to queue at the TKTS booth.All in all can highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again without hesitation."
370,1778,"Jan 16 2005	Great value but with compromises	The location is superb. The rooms are clean, and spacious for NYC standards. I went with a group of 10, and everybody had issues with the temperature control in the rooms. We had a VERY noise a/c unit, that woke us up several times during the night. Others couldn't cool their room enough, another couple could not get any fresh air. Our room on the 7th floor was quiet (except for the a/c); no noise from the street. The breakfast was terrific, with yogurt, bagels,cereal and good coffee.We would stay here again, with some Tylenol PM...."
371,1778,"Jan 13 2005	above average	We spent seven nights at the Comfort Inn Midtown:Positives: Location (couple blocks from Times Square), clean, nice bathroom, continental breakfast included, excellent value for the price (AAA discount 89 + tax). One computer available for free internet usage on main floor.Negatives: our rooms view was a wall and you couldnt open the window (there was a sticker on the window that said: please dont open the window, if you need assistance call the front desk).The idea of lack of fresh air was unpleasant. The front desk staff may need a little training in how to smile, a very good exception was the man who helped at the breakfast, always polite and kind. We will definitely return to this hotel."
372,1778,"Jan 11 2005	Great Location 	We stayed at this hotel from January 5 to January 10, 2005. Overall, we found it to be a good place to stay in midtown Manhattan. Its major benefits were: a great location (only half a block from 7th Avenue and Times Square on one side and just three blocks from Rockefeller Center on the other), very clean rooms and bathrooms, an excellent price (we paid $80.99 a night before the myriad of taxes were added) and a good, free continental breakfast (including, cold cereals, bagels, toast, yogourt, donuts, coffee, milk and juice). The breakfast alone could easily cost you $10.00 each in a local eatery. (Try to get the breakfast table by the window to watch the action across the street on W. 46th St., including the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School and people coming and going from The Muse Hotel, where they are paying two or three times the amount you are. It makes the breakfast taste that much better.) There is only one elevator in this nine-floor building, which can be slow. But, if you are on one of the lower floors, the stairs are easy to navigate. Our only complaints related to: noise (surprisingly, from inside the hotel, not from the outside action - the rooms are not very well soundproofed and the room doors bang very loudly, especially at 2 a.m. when the nightclubbers return) and the layout of our room (as it was small, the television was against a side wall, resulting in a literal pain in the neck). Is this a five-star hotel? No. Did we find it to be excellent value in a city where you likely won't spend much time in your room? A definite yes. (If only they could fix those slamming doors!)"
373,1778,"Jan 10 2005	Good Location below average hotel	Chose this hotel because of great reviews on Tripadvisor. Location of hotel is excellent, just round the corner from Times Square. The quality of accommodation was below average and extremely overpriced for the sub-standard rooms and amenities offered.Was kept awake for 3 nights by a constant noise from the hot water tank which seemed to be shared by everyone on my floor and produced a loud gurgling noise whenever anyone in another room turned on their water supply.Also, it was advertised that there were tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms - my room had an antiquated coffee machine located in the bathroom!.Breakfast was awful and reminded me of a staff canteen with hotel staff watching my every move to check that I didn't take more than my fair share of the food. After trying this for one day, we opted to eat breakfast outside.I feel that this hotel has had over generous reviews on trip advisor and was distinctly average."
374,1778,"Jan 6 2005	Ok for a first time	My husband and I stayed here from Dec 27- Jan 3. Our first room was room # 702 which was very small. We did not stay on New Years eve and returned to room # 704 which was much bigger. Room 702 was very small and the window did not shut. We also could not figure out how to turn on the heat. One of the desk guys came up and helped us. He put a towel in the window. Room 704 was larger but more noisy because it was in the front of the hotel. 702 - the bathroom only had a shower stall and was cleaner than 704 which had a tub. It had a little mold here and there. Nothing shower sandals did not solve. On the 1st, my husband got into a fight with the guy at the front desk about us checking in early. One thing I can say, New Yorkers don't fold easy. He held his ground and they got into a shouting match. How is that for customer service? At any rate my husband was ------ and wanted to stay someplace else but we would have been charged. Plus, the guy had already promised us a larger room. So we stayed.Basicially, we discovered that New Yorkers are a tough bunch of folks. They always seem to be scaming someone or making sure they do not get scammed. Service sucked at most of the restaurants we when to. Most of the time we were treated like they were doing us a favor to serve us. Not much communication. If you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere is true"
375,1778,"Jan 4 2005	Go for it!	We stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown from Nov.28-Dec.2nd and were very satisfied overall. The location is AMAZING, it is very quiet in the hotel even though it is so close to the action. The breakfast was perfect for a quick start to our day. The rooms were small (max 2 people/room), but the bathroom was a nice size and was renovated nicely. Besides, if you are in NYC, you will not be spending much time in the room besides sleeping and showering. The elevator is slow but not such a big deal, an extra few minutes was nothing for the value being given by the hotel."
376,1778,"Jan 4 2005	Friendly staff 	After reading some of the previous reviews on here and seeing the downloadable brochure picture we were a little worried about what to expect when we got there. First of all, may I just say that the brochure picture doesn't do this hotel justice. The hotel was very clean and tidy. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were adequate in size considering this is New York. And it was in an ideal spot for us as it was in walking distance of Macy's and there were plenty of diners/pubs in walking distance as we fancied more of a fried breakfast as opposed to the free continental breakfast provided. Also nearby to Macy's is a multi-screen cinema called Loews screening all the big named films so we weren't short on things to do at night. As I say, we had an absolutely brilliant stay in NYC and we are hoping to go back again around the same time this year as there is so much more we wanted to see AND we'll be staying here again."
377,1778,"Jan 3 2005	Comfortable and clean.	The narrow entrance to the hotel fools you but the room, though small, had plenty of room to get around the bed without tripping over anything. All we wanted was a clean place to sleep at night. The bathroom was a good size with a warm tile floor. Very nice. Looking out the window gave a view of two very close buildings but it kept light from coming in and that gave for a good rest. A good cup of coffee or hot tea and a bagel or cereal gave you a good start to the day. We'd stay there again."
378,1778,"Dec 29 2004	Very clean great location good rate	This hotel provided more than we expected. The room was about 10 by 15, plenty large enough for sleeping, and was very clean. The shower was great--very hot water, great pressure. The continental breakfast had fresh donuts, bagels, and rolls, with real butter available, as well as cereals, fruit, juice, yogut, and coffee. The breakfast room has only about 8 tables and might get crowded if the hotel is very full--at least it was crowded on our last day. They ask you not to bring food back to your room--a good idea considering the challenge of keeping some creatures out of a Manhattan building. Do not expect great views: only 9 stories high and in the middle of long block, you'll not see much. Most room windows are on the side of the building. But with the money you save you can go to one of the reataurants in a fancier hotel. There was no noise from other rooms and very little from the street. There is even a small exercise room with 3 machines. Parking, at only $20 a night, was a few doors down; again, a very good price for midtown Manhattan. Room temperature was good, although the outside temperature varied from 60 to 25. There is a window air conditioner, if that would bother you in the summer."
379,1778,"Dec 24 2004	Good deal	Positives: Location (couple blocks from Times Square), clean, nice bathroom, good lighting, continental breakfast included, excellent value for the price ($135 + $20 tax for 2 queen beds)Negatives: Small room, antiquated hot water heat (have to open the enclosure and turn the knob, no thermostat). It was very cold outside (5 degrees F), and it was cold in the room. There's a window A/C unit, and the cold air blew in thru the vents. The bellhop showed us his trick of stuffing the drapes around the window to block off the A/C vents."
380,1778,"Dec 22 2004 	Excellent value for the money	Stayed here for a conference instead of at the expensive conference hotel. Room was smallish, but very clean and well-appointed. I found the staff to be very helpful and responsive. The water pressure in my shower the first morning wasn't very good -- I let them know and by the next morning, it was fixed and strong. Breakfast was more hardy than the normal continental fare. Highly recommend this for people on a budget."
381,1778,"Dec 21 2004	Not too bad	My wife and I stayed here for one night in December. We had stayed at the Park Savoy (read my review) the four previous nights, but switched hotels for the last night (pre-planned, not because we were disappointed). Compaired to the PS, our room was immaculate and gigantic. I'm exaggerating, but the room was a decent size and the bathroom looked as if it was remodeled recently. Our only complaints were: the room was rathner warm and you cannot open the windows. We had the air conditioner on all night, but it wasn't very cool and the room stayed very warm. Our view consisted of a brick wall and other windows with air conditioners, but at least it was quiet. Finally, there is only one elevator and it was TINY. Overall, the Comfort Inn Midtown is in a great location (2 blocks from Times Square), the staff was very friendly, and the room was clean and you were able to actually move around. AAA rate after taxes was $165, which is pretty reasonable for the location. This is a great place if you are looking for a place to sleep, change and shower, not if you're looking to be pampered. I would probably look at trying a different hotel if I came back to NYC, but would definately stay here if I couldn't find something else that interested me."
382,1778,"Dec 20 2004	Would recommend to anyone	We were looking for a place to stay that is safe, clean and conveniet. That is exactly what we got. I do not have a single complaint about my stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a bargain near Times Square."
383,1778,"Dec 15 2004	we'll never stay here again	Well, first let me say that we knew we'd get what we paid for as far as room size. It was extremely small, but at least it was clean. We usually stay at nice hotels but were trying to save money this time. We have learned our lesson though and will always pay more for a quality stay.Don't even think about making a complaint to the manager. Our air conditioner froze over and we had a miserable night's sleep and not only did not care or offer compensation - she made US feel stupid in front of a lobby full of people for not knowing how to &quot;properly use a window unit.&quot; She was incredibly rude and we are currently going to the higher-ups to get this resolved.I'd pay more to stay somewhere where people actually care about their customers."
384,1778,"Dec 8 2004	Great - Definitely Recommended	We found this hotel brilliant although the front desk staff may need a little training in how to smile....but hey, that is just a little niggle! We had a room away from the street and we found this great - it was very quiet and the room was big enough and very clean. We stayed 3 nights and our room was serviced to a good standard every day. The complimentary brekkie was a bonus as well - quite basic (cereal, fruit, donuts, bagels) but sufficient. The location is superb!! Literally around the corner from Times Square. I would stay here again and would recommend it to my friends."
385,1778,Dec 7 2004	Friendly Hotel	We have just returned from our first trip to New York. We picked this hotel through Tripadvisor and were very pleased with it. The location was perfect The staff couldn't have been more helpful. When we first arrived the room we were offered was very hot so we asked to be moved which they did with no problems at all. The room was comfortable and clean. The buffet breakfast was good. We felt safe leaving our bags on the last day as a member of staff checked them in and out and they were happy for us to leave them until late afternoon. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
386,1778,"Dec 7 2004	Loved it! Would stay again in a minute!	It was a perfect hotel for what we needed it for. The rooms were small, but who spends a lot of time in their room when NYC is right outside?? The rooms were very clean, the bathroom was very clean as well, small, but cute. No complaints there. As far as the location, it could not be more perfect. Walk a 1/2 block and you are in Times Square, and can easily catch a taxi to go uptown or downtown. The staff was very friendly, eager to help in any way. The continental breakfast was a nice suprise, being that it was a small, inexpensive hotel. The price of the room was reasonable, even on a holiday weekend. I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family - it is a nice, basic hotel in a good location for a decent price. I plan on staying there again!"
387,1778,"Dec 5 2004	very good hotel	First visit in NY, stayed there for 4 nights with my fiancee in sept 2004. The hotel is clean, rooms are nice enough and the staff is very helpfull. The Location is simply ideal and prices are moderate.Would definitively go there again!"
388,1778,"Nov 30 2004	Right in the heart of Manhattan	Stayed here for three nights last month. Fantastic location, in a quiet street considering that its about 200 yards from Times Square. Clean, spacious rooms. Friendly, helpful staff and a great continental breakfast included.Within walking distance to heaps of major attractions. I highly recommend this hotel. Enjoy."
389,1778,"Nov 30 2004	Pleasant room but very noisy	I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown for twelve nights in October. The hotel is pleasant enough, in a perfect location, but I found my front-facing room looking on to 46th Street extremely noisy. At all hours of the day and night, garbage trucks would pull up a few doors down the street and stand there for up to an hour, grinding refuse. Fortunately I'd brought ear plugs, which came in very handy when I was regularly woken at 3 or 4 in the morning. There was also a permanent roaring, whooshing sound coming from outside - possibly from a big airconditioning unit on a building opposite. On the plus side, the room was spacious, and definitely nicer than the quieter but smaller and stuffier rooms at the back of the hotel, which look directly on to a brick wall, so I decided to rather put up with the noise.The breakfast that was included in the price was also a plus, as was the unlimited internet access available in the little computer room off the lobby. I also enjoyed having a coffee-maker and hairdryer in the room.However, on my next visit to NYC, I'll probably go back to the Portland Square Hotel where I've always stayed before. It's round the corner on 47th Street, so the location is just as perfect, and the price is far less - $105 for a standard double ensuite, compared with $162 at the Comfort Inn. I've always asked for a street-facing room there and have never had a probem with noise, and at least you can open the windows and get a breath of fresh air, which you can't do at the Comfort Inn. The rooms might be a bit more worn-looking, but are spotlessly clean with towels and linen being changed daily, and the bathroom pristine, with all the usual toiletries provided. There is also air-conditioning, cable TV and an in-room safe - very handy. No, breakfast is not included, but one can get a cheap, delicious breakfast at the Evergreen Diner right across the street, so that's not a problem. There is also no in-room coffee-maker, but I always carry my own little immersion heater, so once again, not a problem. All in all, I have yet to discover a better deal in New York City, than the Portland Square Hotel, for value for money"
390,1778,"Nov 29 2004	Best Time in NYC at Macy's Parade	Trip Advisor is the best! I started making plans in June for my daughter and I to visit the Macy's parade. I wasn't sure what to expect, but Trip Advisor was right on the money with everything I checked out. Comfort Inn Midtown was great - not too high priced, the people there were so nice and helpful. The rooms are a little small - but who spends much time in the room when you're in New York? The motel is within walking distance toalmost everything! We only walked ONE block to the parade at Times Square. Rockefeller Center, theater district, Macy's, Empire State building are all close too. We had a great time and hope to do it again some day!"
391,1778,"Nov 29 2004	Great wee hotel	What can i say? We booked this hotel because off the reviews on here, and we certainly were not disappointed. We had one off the front facing rooms on the top floor 9th, the room was really big,so ask for a tront facing room if possible. VERY CLEAN maid cleaned every day, new towels every day. Staff really helpful with advising us about the area. Really decent price considering you are 20 yards from times square. Breakfast included but we normally went to Evergreen 47th st. Would definetly use again 5 *******"
392,1778,"Nov 26 2004	Great Value!!!	Can't say enough about this hotel. The entrance might not be as grand as some of the other hotels but the cost more than makes up for it. We found the hotel to be clean, quiet and quite roomy (compared to Chicago hotels which I am used to staying at.) It is really at the center of everything and within easy walking distance to several subway stations and of course Times Square. I would highly recommend it to anyone, we will stay there again!"
393,1778,"Nov 25 2004	EXCELLENT CHOICE AND LOCATION	This hotel offered everything we were looking for:1. Economy rates under 190 per night2. comfortable queen size bed3. excellent shower &amp; good sized bathroom4. good sound proofing5. location - 1 minute to Times Square, walking distance to Broadway Shows, Macy's, etc.6. clean rooms7. everything worked in room (tv, clock, air)8. reasonable breakfast (however with the choices in Manhattan we ate out )9. free local phone calls / free safe box at front deskThey allowed us to check in early given the room was available. The only suggestion I could make to management is that a security system be added to the elevator in the evening hours as it seemed nobody looked at us whatever time we came or left our room. The room was small but exactly what I expected. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and if I should be so lucky to get back to NYC anytime soon I would not even bother to seach out other accomodations."
394,1778,"Nov 18 2004	Good value for NYC	Nice little hotel, very close to Time Square! I became a Choice priveleges member right before we left and they allowed us a 2pm checkout and also checked us in right when we arrived, about an hour early. Staff was pleasant, rooms were small but clean. Good free breakfast, but a deli down the street offered a bit more at a reasonable cost. I stayed at the Ameritania a few years ago...and this was soooo much better and more reasonable. I would stay here again"
395,1778,"Nov 17 2004	Location Location Location	Although the room was small, it was spotlessly clean. The bathroom appeared to be recently renovated with a shower, no bath, but in excellent condition. Staff were friendly and helpful. And all this a half a block from Times Square, within easy walking distance of all the theatres, Fifth Avenue shops, and excellent restaurants. Would definitely make this my hotel of choice for a week-end getaway."
396,1778,"Nov 16 2004	Excellent excellent excellent!!	My husband and I have just returned from 3 nights in the Comfort Inn and if we are ever booking a hotel in Manhattan again this will be the place.1. Excellent location - Just two minutes to the TKTS booth. Get there early Thursday to Sunday - LONG lines even at 2.20. Monday to Wedensday lines are short and better choice of shows. We saw The Producers on one night but being Irish it wasn't really our cup of tea - different humour! Lots of people said they enjoyed it and it has great reviews so maybe it's just us. Went to see Slava's Snow Show on our last night - absolutely brilliant! It's really different and if anyone has seen any of the Cirque du Soliel productions, this show is all about the 'clowns' in those shows. It's a real 'feel good show' and I was smiling for hours afterwards. GO SEE IT. It's off braodway (14th and Broadway Union Sq.) and is every bit as good if not better than some of the Broadway shows. Try to get tickets which are on the ground floor and not under the mezanine (you'll see why when you go!!!)- Subway just a couple of blocks away. Two stops to Macy's (came in EXTREMELY handy) and Toys R us etc. USE THE SUBWAY and buy a day travel ticket for $7 (compared to $2/ride). 2. Great breakfast.- No need to waste time looking for somewhere to eat early in the morning. It DOES get a bit busy just before 9am but it isn't a problem. We always got seats and the guy setting it up is VERY helpful. However, if you do feel like a fry-up or a big breakfast there is a great place on 47th st (It's called Evergreen or something like that). Also GREAT Indian place - Bombay something on 49th st.3. Clean roomsOK there a bit small but who cares. There not cramped or anything and I have stayed in smaller. If anything it made us keep everything tidy and theres a closet which has shelves where you can put all your purchases. Room was really hot but there is air- conditioning (just turn it to 10 for maximum NOT 1). The fan does make a little noise but it's nothing to really worry about.YES towels are fairly thin and small but they are fine.4. Other.We didn't ask for a corner room and maybe if we had the room might have been a bit bigger with a view (we were looking at a brick wall). The bonus of the brick wall - no noise! We got to check in at 10.30am with no problems even though official check in isnt until 3pm.They also stored our bags until 8pm no problem.STAY HERE !"
397,1778,"Nov 14 2004	no complaints!	We stayed five nights here early November. Excellent location, wonderful staff and pleasant room. Two women on a shopping trip, we felt perfectly safe here and in the streets around the hotel, we really experienced the best of New York from this accommodation. Even a mishap with our luggage failed to spoil our stay.This will be our first choice for any future stay."
398,1778,"Nov 13 2004	Great Location Friendly Staff Good Value	We spent 4 nights at this hotel in October and really enjoyed our stay. The staff are friendly and helpful and the location of the Hotel is perfect, only half a block from Times Square.We were staying in one of the larger corner rooms (802) and it was a good size. Our room was spotlessly clean. The free continental breakfast was great too, with a good choice of food, not just the usual danish pastries! There was fruit, toast, cereal, bagels, yoghurt, doughnuts and cakes. It can get busy if you are not there early, but we never had a problem getting a seat.We chose this hotel after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. A good value hotel for the price in a great location."
399,1778,"Nov 13 2004	Am I missing something here?	I am a frequent visitor to New York City, and I always stay in midtown Manhattan. I must say that the bulk of these reviews is somewhat surprising ... they're bordering on the gushing, which I find rather surprising for a hotel that offers rooms that are rather worn (at least mine was) and somewhat, um, dingy. I found the bathroom in particular to be sub-par. Maybe if you book at a special low rate (like I did), you will get one of the &quot;inferior&quot; rooms. Other than the price and the location, there is nothing particularly special about this hotel. If you are on a tight budget, I would recommend this place. But I find the Red Roof Inn on West 32nd St to be far superior for about the same price. P.S. I remember staying at the other Comfort Inn (Manhattan) on West 35th Street during the month of February -- there was no heat in my room as well as in others. And this hotel won a gold ribbon award -- can you believe it? Pack your sweaters!"
400,1778,"Nov 11 2004	Spotless 	WOW! Was I ever surprised. Booking this hotel for a group of 7+1 infant &amp; I was worried about it's location &amp; cleanliness. The reviews on Trip Advisor were right on. The hotel was 1/2 block from Times Square and so clean! The rooms are small, but when you are in NYC you are not hanging out in your room as the city is so fabulous. The front desk staff were extremely friendly, allowing us to check our baggage &amp; have something to eat prior to checking in. (It was early in the morning) Great coffee, bagels, yogurt... (all included in the price of the room.) I will definately be staying here on my future trips to NYC."
401,1778,"Nov 4 2004	best budget hotel in NYC	this is my second review and second stay. The last room I had was very big and faced the street. This time I booked last minute and got a fairly small room. Still amenities were there, bathroom was in excellent condition. Very clean and friendly staff. I like this place because they hold your bags after check-out. Breakfast has the essentials but if you walk to 42nd street, there are tons of breakfast places that offer a greater variety. Overall, the best place to stay. I will definitely stay here again."
402,1778,"Nov 3 2004	a great place	stayed in one room with my husband and 3 children(1,2,6). it couldn't have been better. very clean rooms, really friendly staff (especially Anthony in the Breakfast Room- such a nice man), fantastic location.we usually stay in upmarket places but this hotel is much better value and has everything you need. we will definitely stay here on our next trip. trust me, and i am very fussy, this is a wonderful hotel"
403,1778,"Oct 26 2004	Beware: Not easy to cancel	Would not recommend as the chain of hotels does not have a set policy on cancellations. It varies with the hotel and reservations person. It was impossible to cancel the hotel when not able to travel. When you call hotel they transfer you to another group who handles reservations which is independent from Comfort Inn and Choice (Kapil Care Hotels???) who said absolutely no refund under any circumstance. We called Choice Hotels again for help as we were not able to travel. They (we spoke to two different people) said they called the hotel (or Kapil_ and had no success, then when questioned they said they have a list of hotels which have no refund ever policies (okay, so why not just state that and not pretend to call the hotel to help???). Choice would not let us know how to tell which Choice Hotels did not allow cancellations. They said that is a list only they have so only they know which hotels never give refunds. Nice policy. Note, the airline gave a voucher for future travel with no fee."
404,1778,"Oct 20 2004	Very good value !!!!!!	This is a very good hotel, located centrally in Manhattan. The perfect starting point to discover Manhattan. Very cheap for what you get.Whenever we are back in NYC, we will definitely stat at this hotel."
405,1778,"Oct 17 2004	great location	Stayed here sat 9th Oct thru to tues 12th Oct. As others mentioned towels a bit small/thin but otherwise fine. location excellent for Times sq. and transport ( subway etc). Breakfast adequate and included in room rate. No in room safe but deposit boxes at reception (chargeable . Room tidy and clean, for NY a reasonable size. Bit noisy facing street - but then its the Big apple ! Excellent Deli in next street ( 115 W 45th about same position as Comfort Inn but in next street ) called Cranberry Deli . Self selection hot / cold meals and salads ( breakfast / lunch / dinner) , loads of fresh fruit , drinks etc. Upstairs dining as well as take out . Fantastic place ."
406,1778,"Oct 14 2004	Best Value in Manhattan	We sent an overnight in this midtown Manhattan spot--for NYC it was a great value (especially if one used AAA or AARP discounts)--our room was $125.99 including a pretty good continental breakfast of juice, cereal, bagels, doughnuts, yogurt, etc.The location is great, on 46th St.,between 6 and 7th Aves., about a block from the Times Square area.The hotel has an inviting small lobby area and the rooms, while somewhat small, but adequate, were nicely furnished with new paint, wallpaper, etc.The staff goes out of its way to be helpful--you can check luggage if you arrive early or if you check out and leave later.Towels are somewhat thin, but overall this is a great place to stay in NYC. Do not miss it!!"
407,1778,"Oct 10 2004	Great Value	This hotel is in a great, safe location. Staff is friendly. Rooms are a bit small (even by NY standards) but they are clean and have nice bathrooms. The price is excellent given the central location. I would definitely stay here again."
408,1778,"Sep 19 2004	Nice Place.	The Comfort Inn Midtown was a great place. Although the room was small, it had everything we needed. The Continental breakfast was great too. The staff was quite friendly and the hotel was clean. Well worth the money. The high speed wireless internet sucked though. Did not function properly."
409,1778,"Sep 17 2004	Excellent Standard 	This 79 room hotel provides excellent value. Very clean &amp; secure. Rooms have TV &amp; coffee maker. The complimentary breakfast, available 7 till 10 was a bonus. Ideal for a short visit as its close to Times Sq. for bus &amp; subway."
410,1778,"Sep 15 2004	Best bargain in NYC - really!	Truly the best bargain in NYC at present. We've stayed in several 3-4 star hotels in the upper $200+ range, and this hotel, for under $200 is clean, comfortable and in a terrific location! &quot;The Muse&quot; is right across the street and is $250 a nite! While they may have thicker towels, and plusher carpet, their rooms are no bigger.Re: other concerns: the people we met in the hotel were really nice, the staff friendly, efficient and courteous, the elevator, although only one, came quickly, and the shower had great water pressure.The ac had a timer setting, and the tv had cable. Other things like a coffee maker, ice bucket, etc., were all stock amenities in the room. The ONLY downside was the not-so-thick towels, but I could live with that!Also, parking down the street that the Comfort Inn recommends and stamps for, is a bargain in NYC.Don't forget to ask for your AAA discount!"
411,1778,"Sep 8 2004	Terrific Small Hotel	I read about the Comfort Inn Midtown on the Trip Advisor web site. It had received excellent reviews.We were not disappointed. It reminded me of anEnglish Bed and Breakfast Inn. The rooms were spotless, staff friendly and helpful, complimentary breadfast was all one could eat, the room was quiet, location of hotel near Times Square is perfect for theatre goers. The only noise we heard was the morning chiming of church bells next door.The room rate is reasonable. Also appreciated the in-room coffe-maker, hair dryer, iron and ironing board. The other guests were congenial.Yes, I will stay there on my next trip to New York City."
412,1778,"Aug 28 2004	Took a chance	I had checked and double checked all the tripadvisor comments and took the chance on this hotel. I had never stayed in a hotel in NYC before so I was not sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The rooms were small in comparison to what I have been used to in Chicago or Dallas, etc. but, that is what I had heard would be the case. I was very pleased with the cleanliness. My sheets were as white as snow and crisp. The bathroom was spotless. Oh, and our showerhead broke and was fixed immediately, the staff was very helpful with this glitch. This hotel is close to all the sights. We walked to The Empire State Blg., the shows, NBC, Fox and Friends, Rockafeller Center, Stores, St. Patrick's Cathederal. The breakfast offered from this hotel was a bonus each morning. Yes, the elevator is slow...and there is only one but if you are up for the stairs, they are clean and safe. I was with my 13 year old daughter and the room was sufficent in size for us (1 Q bed) but would not be for someone traveling with a family. I am not sure if they have larger accomodations in the hotel but what we had would not work for a family. Only two people would be comfortable in this size room. I would also suggest to any sight-seers to spend the money for the Hop on Hop Off Grayline New York Sight Seeing Double Decker Bus tours. We spent $72 for The Essential New York which gets you in to The Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, The Seaport Museum (where the Concord is on display), Ticket to the United Nations, and a night tour of Brooklyn via a safe bus ride. This was the best decision I have made. We went to the front of the line for all sites and we were able to SEE everything from a great vantage point on top of the double decker bus. The tour guides are very knowledgeable about NY from the Revolutionary War time to present. Jumping off when you want to visit Battery Park or grab a slice of pizza pie was wonderful. Another bus picks you up from the same dropoff point in twenty minutes to go somewhere else!I would stay at Midtown Comfort Inn again if I visited NY, the price was more than reasonable, the rooms were very, very clean, breakfast was great and we were in the heart of everything that makes NYC, New York! The Irish Pub next door was a fabulous establishment too, fabulous food and great Irish Cider!"
413,1778,"Aug 26 2004	You Can't Beat this Hotel	We spent 5 nights at the Comfort Inn Midtown. Very clean rooms and public areas. Helpful, courteous staff, great rates and location. Nice complementary breakfast. Have been to NYC several times and I have never been more satisfied with a hotel."
414,1778,"Aug 16 2004	Great value	Clean, spacious rooms with a helpful staff. I didn't expect much for under $100, but this place was perfect for a quick trip to the city when all we would do at the hotel was sleep. It's not fancy with lots of frills -- but is all that you need and in the heart of Midtown."
415,1778,"Aug 12 2004	Good reasonably priced hotel near Times Square	We stayed on the Comfort Inn (3  9 Aug) on recommendations found on this and other review sites. It was a good hotel at a reasonable price, but as we came from the UK we didn't qualify for any discounts. The check-in was quick and staff were generally friendly and helpful. On check-in we asked for a quiet room and were told that if we wanted a quiet room it would be small. It certainly was small, but as we were only 2 it was bearable. And it was quiet as long as you didnt switch on the air conditioning. I thought I might get used to it, but after 3 nights I still couldnt sleep well because of the noise. Luckily it wasnt too hot after that, so we just left it switched off at night. Otherwise the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. There was not much of a view, but I wasnt expecting any at this price. Bathroom was also small and clean. There was no safe in the room, but you can use one at reception at no extra cost. The lift was not fast, but Id seen slower. I didnt find it a big problem and we were staying on the 9th floor. The breakfast was o.k. (bagels, toast, donuts), but it was always busy in the tiny breakfast room. So you couldnt relax, we just ate quickly and got out. Location was great, if you want to stay near Times Square. It was also close to several subway stations, so getting around was no problem. Most restaurants in this area are overpriced and not very good. However, we liked Via Brasil and especially Trattoria Trecolori where we had one of the best Italian meals ever. I recommend this hotel to first time visitors to New York. However, the crowds of tourists in that area got on my nerves a bit after a few days, so I probably would stay in a different neighbourhood next time."
416,1778,"Aug 11 2004	Great room and location	I stayed here for several weekdays in June, 2004. I was very satisfied with the size of the room, cleanliness, and the friendliness of the staff. It has a wonderful location, close to Times Square, the diamond district and Broadway venues - but far enough not to get a lot of the noise. From my room, I didn't hear any bells ringing from the church next door. The only &quot;problem&quot; is that it has one slow elevator. If you have difficulty walking and you are impatient, this may not be the right hotel for you. I would gladly return here on a future trip to NYC."
417,1778,Aug 9 2004	Great hotel..will stay here again!	I did so much research before booking this hotel. I stayed for a weekend in June and I had a great time. It's located a half block away from Times Square. The subway station is 2 or 3 blocks away. The room was clean and big. Get a room in a corner because the corner rooms are bigger. I really loved it and it was great for the price. I would definitely stay here again!
418,1778,"Aug 9 2004	Great place to stay	Great location, just steps from theaters, restaurants and the subway. Very helpful staff, they found a place to park my full size truck that didn't require refinancing to pay for. Hotel is clean, modern, and while the room sizes were moderate, they weren't cramped by any definition. No problems with the elevator either. I've paid more for less in cities other than NY. I would stay here again without question."
419,1778,"Aug 9 2004	Great location - hard as a rock beds	Our first trip ever to NYC - 10 wonderful days! Just a warning though - yes, the Comfort Inn is all of those things you're reading in the 5 star reviews. It's has a great location, good staff, nice breakfast, and is a great economy choice for a vacation.The only warning is the beds - at least ours - are cheap and hard. They have to cut corners somewhere, right? Sheets are not cotton, some sort of slick feeling, thin, polyester I'd guess. And the bed? Practice with a couple of nights on your garage floor and you'll do fine."
420,1778,"Aug 9 2004	Clean Comfortable Great Staff Great Location.	Just got back from a 4 night stay. Excellent Staff, excellent location. Small rooms and a bit of trouble with the plumbing, but no big deal. Much better than the rooms we had in Venice and Rome. Would definitely stay here again! Very good continental breakfast, comfortable beds, location can't be beat, affordable, clean, GREAT value.Attitude is everything. If you are looking for master bedroom sized rooms, the Marriott Marquis is just 5 minutes away, but will cost you a bunch more.What makes this hotel special is the Staff. They will take care of you. We found the rooms comfortable, the a/c worked great. I'm recommending this property to everyone I know who is going to NY on vacation."
421,1778,"Aug 5 2004	Great location to stay and park	Just back from 2 nights at this hotel. The location is excellent, just steps away from Times Square and everything else mentioned here.Parking is just 5 doors down at a rate of $20. per 24 hours with validation. Front desk staff very helpful and pleasant (Jiovanni) and bellman (Sidibi) treated us like we were at the Plaza Hotel, very friendly and courteous.Bathroom is very spacious and found it and the bedroom to be very clean and well maintained.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking simply for location and a clean safe place to stay while visiting the city."
422,1778,"Aug 3 2004	Perfect place for your first trip to NY	My mom and I traveled to New York for the first time and found the Comfort Inn to be perfect for us. The previous reviews of this hotel helped me in making my decision to stay here, so I was extremely pleased to learn that all the reviews were right on. If you are looking for a great view and lots of extra services, skip this hotel. However, if you are like my mom and I and plan to spend very little time in your room and more time exploring NY this is the perfect spot. Hotel is within walking distance to Times Square, Broadway shows, Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building and Central Park. Rooms are quiet and comfortable and the bathroom is spacious. The breakfast is a nice bonus and saved us the hassle of trying to find a place to eat every morning. My mom and I would not hesitate to stay here again."
423,1778,"Jul 29 2004	Good People -Great Location!	Great hotel at a great location. The staff and service was excellent and the continental breakfast adequate. We asked for a quite room and recieved one (albeit a bit small). But, in short walking distance to most theatres and the TKTS booth. For the money I think it was a great value (non-smoking as well)."
424,1778,"Jul 29 2004	Small no-frills hotel--perfect location!	My wife and I stayed five nights here in last week of June, paying $125/night (U.S.) with AAA discount. The hotel is very small and has few amenities but its location more than makes up for it. It's a perfect launching pad for exploring the city, especially if youre up for walking and taking buses and trains. Its a 2-minute walk from Times square, a 10-minute walk from Rockefeller Center and about the same to the 42nd Street subway. (By the way, be prepared for a variety of added NYC taxes on your final hotel bill!)I was on my guard regarding what the hotel would be like, after reading all the various reviews of NYC hotels. But its all about expectations. Expect less and youll be satisfied with less. Check-in was fine. Hotel lobby was quite nice. Asked about a bigger room at the back and was given 606. Smallish elevator and only one. Room was smaller than most hotels weve stayed in North America, but was larger than the discount rooms we had in Rome and Venice. Bathroom was very small, shower quite small, and very limited counter space at sink. View? Brick walls, pigeons, air conditioners and an alley. (Only rooms on floors 7-9 get an actual view of any kind.) Room included TV, nice firm queen bed, desk, side table, small closet with some hangers, iron, ironing board, and bathroom hair dryer. There were a couple of cigarette burns on the bedspread/blanket. Air conditioner worked great for us with temps around 28C every day. No bugs, room was cleaned every morning, room service supplied extra towels when we asked. Room was very quiet at night.One computer available for free internet usage on main floor. Supposedly Wi-Fi was available in room as well as the high-speed line, but I wasnt able to make it work for my older Mac laptop and the staff weren't able to help. Ice is only available in basement, the biggest inconvenience we faced (which really wasnt a huge deal).Staff were relatively helpful. If you want to be pampered, this is not the hotel for you. They will help take care of you but they generally make guests feel independent. That part of it made me think of a hostel. The bellmen weren't highly enthusiastic but did their job.Simple but very sufficient free breakfast included bagels, donuts, toast, buns, yogurt, fruit, coffee, tea, milk, juice.Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it for budget-conscious couples who will spend most of their day away from the hotel."
425,1778,"Jul 22 2004	Good hotel in Midtown	Just came back from a 3-nite stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown. Completely satisfied! Hotel is clean, quiet. Staff attentive and responsive (got a bathroom problem fixed in 10 minutes after the call). Excellent location to explore Manhattan."
426,1778,"Jul 22 2004	What a great place for a honeymoon!	My wife and I went to the Comfort Inn for the last half of our honeymoon. We loved the staff. The gentleman who helped with the continental breakfast was very friendly, and even asked my wife where I was on the 2nd morning of our stay. The front desk was extremely helpful, giving us the lowdown on the city and restaurant choices in the area. Only a block from the middle of Times Square, but on a quieter street so it wasn't in the middle of everything, an excellent location! The business center and workout facilities were a nice touch for the room as well. We got the best rate by going straight to Comfort Inn's website. Parking was across the street. We kept our vehicle there for 72 hours, and it only cost a total of $60 with a hotel stamp. The room was small, but clean. And the bathroom was a great size compared to the size of the room. I would recommend anyone to stay there. May not be the fanciest, but it sure was friendly!"
427,1778,"Jul 22 2004	Average hotel fantastic location.	I stayed here for 5 nights in May. The room was small but clean and fairly comfortable. We were concerned that it would be a bit noisy with a location so close to Times Square, but we never heard a thing except for the next rooms plumbing (who has a shower at 4-30 in the morning, every day?).The location could hardly have been better, so close to Times Square and with great links to the rest of Manhattan.The only thing I would do differently next time is go for room only rather then bed and breakfast because the breakfasts were really not worth having."
428,1778,"Jul 21 2004	All you need!	Visited in July 2004, Location excellent, rooms clean, staff extremely attentive, hotel quiet. What else do you need? Will stay here again on next visit."
429,1778,"Jul 20 2004	Depends on your needs	I resided at this property a few weeks ago. for two days. I wanted a room close to Times Square that was reasonably priced and clean. I booked through the hotel website and found a rate of $125.00. This is the max I would have wanted to pay for this room. The room is very small (as most New York hotel rooms are) and very basic. Nothing fancy about the rooms at all. The location was excellent. Couldn't have been any better. Had a small issue with the toilet not being as clean as it should have been which pretty much ruined the confidence I had in the hotel. The disgusting picture never left my mind throughout the whole trip. I do understand that the housekeeping staff can not be PERFECT and I don't expect them to be BUT...........The staff are absolutely wonderful. Front desk and door people tried to be very helpful. Previously I stayed at the Super 8 which I later found out that this hotel is part of the same ACCOR hotel group. I met nice people here and would I stay again???? I'm not quite sure. I think I would say no UNLESS the rate is very low. There is no view as might be expected. I would say that the best part of the the Comfort Inn Midtown is the staff and the what needs improvement is the quality of the furniture, bedding, carpet etc. It would seem to me that because the rooms are small it would be not as expensive to furnish the rooms with some quality items. I think that people would not mind &quot;small&quot; if it was small but classy and decorated with a somewhat quality items. It would give the place a whole different air of quality which regrettfully it does not have. I'll mention housekeeping may need a little improvement but my toilet situation may have been an isolated thing. Hey, I'm not perfect on my job either but constructive criticism does not hurt.Please do NOT let me discourage you from trying this property. It's probably fine for some but I'm telling the experience I had. All in all...two days was enough for me. I was ready to leave. Was it awful - &quot;NO&quot;. Could it use improvement...&quot;YES&quot;"
430,1778,"Jul 20 2004	Great stay and staff at Comfort Inn	Have just returned from a five night stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown and found the hotel to be clean,comfortable and the staff helpful in every way. While the room was small it was clean and met our needs for two people. Everyone on the staff was friendly and the hotel is in an excellent location to Times Square, Theatres and Shopping. It is in walking distance to Rockefeller Center,NBC studios and David Letterman. Price is reasonable for Manhattan and we would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
431,1778,"Jul 13 2004	Great location and clean!	We stayed here over the Fourth of July weekend and it was wonderful! The location is absolutely perfect if you want to spend time wandering Times Square &amp; doing the Broadway circuit! The rooms were much bigger than I expected, plenty of room for my husband &amp; I and two large suitcases! The bathroom for roomy enough for two people at the same time and was very clean! We made a couple of requests to the staff and they responded quickly &amp; politely! Kenneth &amp; &quot;The Breakfast Gentleman&quot; were wonderful &amp; amazing employees! The free continential breakfast was very appealing (donuts, bagels, toast, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, beverages). The other reviews are correct in that the elevator is slow, but it never was an inconvience. I am very picky when it comes to hotel cleanliness and it was perfect! The air conditioner was great &amp; the bed was comfy! I would stay here again!"
432,1778,"Jul 4 2004	Clean and comfortable	I spent six nights at the Comfort Inn Midtown and guess what - it lived up to the positive reviews! The hotel was clean and well maintained. The bathroom was great - white tile and marble floors and pretty big. The room, while small, was well lit and the matress was comfortable - important points for me. The only minus was the view from the window, a narrow airshaft , but at least you can draw the blinds. I would definitely stay here again."
433,1778,"Jul 4 2004	first trip to New York	This was our first trip to the Big Apple. I read all the reviews on this hotel and thanks to you guys, we were very well pleased. The room was small but very neat and clean. The bathroom was a good size and the internet was a plus. The bed was comfty and I asked for extra pillows and the maid brought them right away. There was plenty of room for all the shopping bags in a large closet. The breakfast spread was impressive and more than enough to get us going in the mornings. Everyone working in the hotel was extremely nice and helpful. They gave good directions and cashed travelers cheques for me. The location was wonderful. Close to everything including the subway. I felt safe at all times and we were out at all hours. We paid $125 a night. We will definetely return to this hotel."
434,1778,"Jun 27 2004	Highly recommended!!	To add my thoughts to the many others on this little hotel...this was a marvelous find for me the first time I visited NYC in July 2001 with courteous staff, excellent location and rooms that were clean. Yes, they are small, but I don't come to NYC planning to spend much time in the hotel. The continental breakfast is a nice included bonus. I have stayed there on almost every trip since and have never been disappointed. As a female who travels solo to the city from time to time, I can definitely say that I always felt very safe with the location of the hotel."
435,1778,Jun 23 2004	Great Hotel - Great Rates - Great Location	This little hotel is awesome! It was under $110 a night with a continental breakfast included. How could you beat that along with $20 parking for 24 hours and only one safe block away from Times Square. We will definately be back!
436,1778,"Jun 22 2004	Great! Cheap! Good Location!	It stayed there at the end of may and it was great. Paid 120 Dollar per night and excepted not too much but was impressed. Rooms are clean and big enough, towels are changed every day, TV, Phone, Coffeemaker, Iron - all in the room. Great Hotel to stay, great location, just around the corner of Times Square!!! STAY THERE!"
437,1778,"Jun 20 2004	Convenient Clean 	I would highly recommend the Comfort Inn Midtown. One block to Times Square, with clean and comfortable rooms (the entire hotel is smoke-free). Friendly and accommodating staff. Superb continental breakfast. All this for less than $170 a night for two guests! I will definitely stay here during my next visit to NYC!"
438,1778,"Jun 17 2004	Great price clean room excellent location	The reviews on this page were helpful in making the decision to stay at this hotel. We booked online through Comfort Inn's web page and got a AAA discount at a great rate from midweek (June3-5).The rooms were tiny, although clean and quiet. The location made up for the small room. Being so close to Times Square and the subway were an added bonus.I would definately recommend this hotel if you are on a budget and want a room close to the action and in a safe location."
439,1778,"Jun 17 2004	Times Square Central!	Great place to stay. Times Square right down the block, great if you've been walking all day. You're not overwhelmed with people, traffic, &amp; noise as you are in the other &quot;bigger&quot; hotels right smack in the middle of Times Square. Room was small but pretty clean, looking newly refurbished including the bathroom. Not just the &quot;painted over &quot; look. Staff was courteous and helpful. Elevator was re-e-eally slow, avoid room next to it. HOT WATER CAUTION!! Hot water pipes have scalding hot water!!! Almost burned myself a couple of times when using the sink and shower when the water pressure dropped which was fairly consistent in the mornings and evenings. Price is reasonable especially for the location. Didn't pay outrageous &quot;bigger&quot; hotel rates. How much time does one really spend in their hotel room!? Would stay here again."
440,1778,"Jun 16 2004	Great Hotel	I just got back from staying one week at the mid-town comfort inn, great two star hotel rooms are nice and clean. Close by everything in New York. I will stay here again. Thanks to tripadvisor."
441,1778,"Jun 4 2004	A real find!	We just returned from a stay at Comfort-Midtown (May 29-June 2) and highly recommend it. The location is excellent. It was clean, quiet and smoke free! The continental breakfast is nice and the staff was very friendly. The rooms are small and plain, but I have stayed in the same for much more in New York. They give discounts for AAA/AARP and we were extremely pleased with our rate for Sunday-Tues. One small caveat is to avoid Sat. nights when the rate jumps (almost double). Another plus is that it is a small hotel. Many thanks to Giovanni at the front desk and to the gentleman who handled the continental breakfast each morning and was so pleasant. I honestly didn't think I could find anything (so close to Times Square) for such a reasonable price."
442,1778,"May 28 2004	Comfort Inn was Comfortable and More	Stayed there May 19 - 25, 2004. Wonderful place to stay. Inexpensive; comfortable; easy access to all forms of transportation; walking distance to all theatres and hundreds of restaurants. A half-block away from Times Square and you could not hear a single sound all night. Weather was in the high 80's with 80+% humidity and the little air conditioner in the room worked like a charm! Small room, but what do you want for $100/night? Staff was somewhat distracted and aloof, but Siddidi (?) the bell captain and the little foreign gentleman in the breakfast room were incredibly helpful and friendly. Only downsides: elevator was hopelessly slow (we were on the 9th floor) and the water pressure in the shower was erratic (water temperature was fine, however.) I will stay here every time I visit New York!"
443,1778,"May 27 2004	Great Place to Stay	We stayed at the hotel three nights in late April and loved it. My wife and I took my parents to New York for their first visit. The location, half block from Times Square, was perfect. My parents are very active and fit but still they are near seventy. It was an easy walk to many restaurants, the theaters, Rockefeller Center and the subway. The rooms and hallways are small and narrow, not unlike many hotels in New York. Yet everything was clean and in good repair. Staff was friendly and helpful. Tough to beat for the price. We are already planning another trip and will definitely stay here again."
444,1778,"May 26 2004	Great Value Great Location	The room was clean, the staff were helpful, the breakfast was good, the place is quiet, the price is reasonable and the location is great. What else could you want in a hotel in Manhattan? This is definitely where I will stay on future trips to New York City."
445,1778,"May 24 2004	A great hotel	I loved this hotel. The room was very reasonable and for the price was very nice. It was small, but it had everything you need and the bathroom was surprisingly large.It was extremely quiet and very clean. I like the hotel so much I will probably stay there again although in my opinion Times Square is not really the place to stay.One thing...hope for a room on a lower floor as the elevator is slow."
446,1778,"May 5 2004	Great Price and Location	Stayed here April 2004. Okay ... let's be realistic. This is a 2 star Comfort Inn. So, it's doesn't have the biggest room or nicest lobby. However ... it was less than $100 a night and half a block from Times Square. You can't beat this kind of deal!"
447,1778,"Apr 21 2004	great little hotel	stayed in this hotel dec 03 3 girls on first visit to new york great place as a base to explore n y would stay here again and would def go to new york again loved every hectic min of it brill , a visit to the shopping outlet is a must if you like designer at cheap prices and chinatown is a must if you love fake cant tell the diff with a lot of the bags tiffanys was a bit of a dissapointment but the fake tiffs in chinatown were great"
448,1778,"Apr 20 2004	Great Find	Stayed in the Comfort Inn Midtown for 5 nights the week of April 5th. Decided to stay here because of the reviews on this website. I was not disappointed. First, the location is excellent, in between Broadway and 6th Ave. This made for quick walks to all the theaters, Times Square, Rockefeller Center and 5th and Madison Avenue shopping. Also close to Subway stations making it easy to get anywhere in NYC. Second, the hotel itself is nice. Rooms are small, but this is NY. Very clean and staff is super nice. Also free breakfast. And finally, the price is right. $100 a night for the location and the ameneties, you can't beat it. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone."
449,1778,"Apr 12 2004	Great location at a great price	Last week I visited Manhattan and spent the night at the Comfort Inn Midtown. Before making the reservation, I looked on the tripadvisor website and noticed that it had received some great reviews. I wasn't disappointed. Located within minutes of Times Square and right in the middle of the theater district, we found it to be quite a find. Surprisingly, it is on a quiet block. The staff is friendly, a complimentary continental breakfast is included and the rooms (though small) are adequate and very clean. It is also a smoke free establishment. Once again, tripadvisor helped me make a terrific choice at a bargain price!"
450,1778,"Mar 31 2004	Oasis and a real Haven in manhattanin...!	We stayed at Comfort Inn..23 thru 30th March 04 Fabulous wee smart quiet hotel...staff genuinely friendly..if you make the effort also ! Rooms clean and functional....although you may face a wall !...however because of its superb location you will be out most of the times ..strolling around ! Watch out for your Air con Unit..ours needed 'fixed' as rooms built up quite a heat Some room doors can bang shut..so do think of other guests ! Breakfast room is a treat ..Antony'hovers' and makes sure everybody is serviced (with a genuine smile.. not the &quot;have a nice day&quot; insincere nonsense either) ...good selection of all you might need in a continental breakfast. 46th Street is a very mixed activity area..with a Church next door.Bells calling the faithful are quite pleasant..&amp; not loud We enjoyed our strolls morning and night....with no real worries Would defineatly go back.....saw the large 'lines', at other Hotel check in/outs..you wont get this here !!"
451,1778,"Mar 31 2004	Excellent Value for NYC	Stayed here from March 17 - 21. This is a great value for a hotel in NYC. We paid $107 per night, which included a fairly substantial continental breakfast. First - the room was a decent size. We did not feel cramped. Second - the bed was comfortable, as was the temperature of the room. Third - we barely heard any noise from neighboring rooms even though the hotel was sold out. Fourth - breakfast included coffee, capaccino, juice, cereal, good fresh donuts and bagels, apples, bananas, yogurt and jellies, cream cheese, etc. Many days we only snacked in the afternoon and ate our next full meal for dinner. Fifth - room was done beautifully each day, asked for extra pillows and they were there when we returned. Sixth - you could not ask for a better location - 1/2 block off of Times Square. Seventh - we felt safe in the neighborhood and in the hotel. Eighth - staff was very friendly and helpful.Only negative - our room faced 46th street. Needed ear plugs to block out the garbage truck noise each morning around 5 am. Believe me, it was loud. Ask for a room away from the street.We will definitely go back to this hotel."
452,1778,"Mar 23 2004	WOW what value!	Great experience in NYC, 11- 16 March at the Comfort Inn MIDTOWN. It's literally 1minute from Times Square - Yay. Was expecting a tiny room after reading the reviews but our room (801) was great! Queen bed &amp; heaps of room for all our shopping bags. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY... IT WAS WONDERFULLY CLEAN. As members of the NZ AA we receive receiprocal rights to AAA rates in the USA, so our rate at the Comfort Inn was $107:00!!! This included a really good continental breakfast - can not imagine anyone complaining about the quality or quantity of food. The staff were friendly (In fact did not get to meet any of the famed &quot;Rude New Yorkers&quot; we'd heard so much about). Loved New York ! Will be back, and will stay at the Comfort Inn MIDTOWN again."
453,1778,"Mar 19 2004	location is everything	Stayed at the comfort inn march 3-8 2004 after reading good reviews on this site.We were not disappointed, rooms were comfy very clean,towels changed daily.Free breakfast all that you needed to send you on your way. then theres the location 30 yards to the centre of times square,perfect location in the midtown area. and you dont suffer from any noise at night like some of the hotels on the main strip do. Great place to stay in a brilliant happening city. we would stay here again when hopefully we return to New York.And all this at a budget price."
454,1778,"Mar 12 2004	A good choice!	I would definitely recommend (and I already did it!) this hotel for a stay in NYC. I've been there in January 2004 following the Tripadvisor users' advices; I indeed found it relatively cheap, comfortable, clean, and the location is great.On the &quot;grey&quot; side I can possibly say that some peope of the staff seemed a bit cold sometimes. But perhaps it's the NY standard, and in any case we all can handle this!"
455,1778,"Mar 9 2004	What a bargain!	We spent a week here in February and were very happy with the hotel. The location is unbeatable, as others have noted, and was clean and comfortable at a very good price (especially for Manhattan). A number of bonuses - the free breakfast, free internet access and local calls and (much appreciated) the fact that the whole hotel is smoke-free! We would stay there again in that famous New York minute!"
456,1778,"Feb 26 2004	WE STAY HERE ON EVERY TRIP INTO NYC	We stay at this hotel whenever we go into the city for an overnight stay. Don't let the furniture in the lobby provide your first impression. You'd think they'd replace it. The rooms vary in size, but are always adequate. The bathrooms are kept spotless as well as the rooms. Beds are a bit hard, but adequate. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast saves having to find a place to eat early in the AM. Great hotel, a great price and great location."
457,1778,"Feb 13 2004	Excellent value for money	We enjoyed our stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown. The room was a good size &amp; was clean with comfy beds, the bathroom was spacious &amp; absolutely spotless. Staff were friendly &amp; helpful - we requested a replacement light bulb for the bedside lamp which was dealt with promptly (which has not always been my experience when staying in other more expensive hotels). Would stay here again as the room rates are excellent for what you get &amp; the hotel is in a great location on a quiet street but minutes away from Times Square."
458,1778,"Jan 15 2004	Great Hotel Great Price Fantastic Location	We stayed here the weekend before christmas and had a great stay. Its very convienient for strolling round times square. you can easily walk to Fifth Avenue, Saks etc, Central Park, Rockafella centre and even Macy's. The rooms and batrooms were well presented, with simple, but nice decoration and spotlessly clean. The beds were comfortable. The room were a good size, even by New York standards, but you dont go to New York to sit in your room! Within our party we had 3 rooms, all in different parts, all different and all came up above expectation. All the rooms were quiet, and i certainly didnt hear anyone in the next room. I dont think I have ever stayed in a hotel, where you cant here some noise from the corridor and even that was very minimal and didnt disturb us. Didnt really notice the elevator was slow. Would definately go back. only paid $116.00, which for the standard and the location was amazing."
459,1778,"Jan 13 2004	Don't Be Fooled By The Name	I was very pleased with our stay at the Comfort Inn. Although, not my usual hotel of choice, this was quite a bargain. The rooms were large (by New York standards) and clean. The location was unbeatable: a subway stop right outside your door, Macy's 1/2 block away, the Empire State Building on the next block, and walking distance to another dozen sights. Throw in a complentary continental breakfast and an Irish Pub, it was truly a delightful experience. You could do a lot worse for a lot more in The Big Apple."
460,1778,"Jan 12 2004	Pleasantly Surprised!	I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown during the Thanksgiving 2003 holiday. I'd never travelled to the New York area overnight before and was travelling with my mother; therefore, it was imparative to locate a decent and convenient hotel. I searched high and low at every hotel site attempting to find the best I could find at a reasonable rate and with availability. Of course every hotel ever reviewed has a bad review but when I read all of the reviews for this hotel, I felt that the overall comments weren't that bad. (And of course two people can stay at the same hotel at the same time and have two entirely different experiences or I could go to the same place twice and have two totally different experiences, but....)Anyway, we stayed there and it was excellent. We had the room with 2 twin beds which was larger than we expected. There was plenty of room to move around, nice and moderate bathroom and bedroom furniture. Our room was on one side of the hotel; therefore, we did not have the noisey elevator problems. The complementary continental breakfast was very nice along with the attendant that serviced it. The staff was quite helpful with turkey day dinner suggestions with connections so that we didn't have to wait in line, supplying coupons for local attractions, etc. It is an excellent location on 46th street and nice to be off the main street. Only had to walk to the end of our block to view the parade! Our experience was lovely and we plan to stay again this year with the hope and expectation that experience is just the same or better. For our experience, I think we got MORE than we paid for at $135/night with the room, service, location, and the breakfast. It is a 2-star hotel, what do you expect. But we were very pleasantly surprised. AND, yes, the one small, slow elevator took some patience as we once walked up to our 8th floor room!"
461,1778,"Jan 11 2004	Great place location rooms etc.	great location, 100 bucks only about 50 yards from the epicenter of times square. Rooms are extremely clean, desk people very polite. Stayed with a group, had 4 rooms for two nights, and everyone was very satisfied. When you reserve, ask for a room ending in 1,2 or 3... like room 802 for example...they tend to be bigger rooms. Join comfort inn membership club, free and quick to do at the Comfort Inn website. You then get 10% off your room and you get a room upgrade for free. One minor negative, elevator is slowwwwww!, but not a major inconvenience. Enjoy. I will def. stay there again vs paying nearly 2x as much across the street at the larger hotels. this place is a Gem!"
462,1778,"Jan 5 2004	Good and Bad	I have both good things and bad things to say about this hotel. Some of the good sides are... 1. Excellent location, extremely convenient 2. Cute and Clean 3. Good price 4. Offer breackfast with good capcino 5. Workers are not mean like normal NYkersSome of the bad things are... 1. So NOISY in the hotel. Noise is not from outside but from inside. Every door of the rooms gets slammed throughout the day, some doves come and stay at the window every morning around 7am and keep making lots of noises, The church next to the hotel has thier bell ring every 30 min. in the morning, people talk loudly in the very tiny hallway. 2. NO BATH TUB to bathe. we thought this woldn't be a problem, but you'll most likely want to take a bath after much walking, just to get rid of some fatigue. 3. Elevator is pretty slow and not convenient 4. Some workers are not helpful. A couple next to our room was having a terrible fight , with screaming, yelling and crying, for 3 hours from 1am. We called the front desk, but the guy did't do anything. We were so sleepless besides all other noises.If you decide to use this hotel, make sure to go to bed after 12 pm and wake up by 7am to avoid all the noises. Also, ask the front desk to change the room if you get one next to the elevator because the room is much smaller and the bed is right next to the door.This hotel is not terrible, but we will not use it again because we want to be able to realx when we come back to a hotel."
463,1778,"Dec 30 2003	You Get What you Pay For	After reading all of the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor for this hotel, I made reservations to stay there the weekend after Christmas. Upon arriving my wife and I were sorely disappointed by the size and quality of the rooms. The room was barely big enough to hold the queen bed and the bathroom was a sink and a tub. In addition the room seemed tired and worn.Worst of all, the elevator (one only) was breaking down and my wife (needing a cane) had to climb four flights of stairs. When discussed with hotel management, they stated &quot;Sorry, but live with it.&quot; As this was unacceptable, we had to move to another hotel.We should have known that, for the rates advertised and the hotel's location near Times Square, that we would be getting this type of room and ambiance but I did not get that feeling from reading the other reviews here. So, if you are looking only for location and a small room, go for it but be ready to accept the downside to the hotel."
464,1778,"Dec 26 2003	Hope To Return Here Again.... and Again.... and Again	Super place. I felt safe, the location was great, the rooms were clean and nice. The staff was exceptional !! The best $ rate I could find. My first trip to New York and the people at the hotel helped make it a wonderful experience."
465,1778,"Dec 21 2003	Great place to stay!	Stayed at the comfort inn from 12/19 to 12/20 for 125.00, after reading other reviews on this site. I have nothing but good things to say. The staff was very helpful, Giovanni was very pleasant and informative during check in. The room was very clean and well maintained. This place was right in the heart of Times Square. I will not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to all budget minded travellers to NYC"
466,1778,"Nov 19 2003	Fantastic Place	After reading reviews on many websites, we decided to stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown, the weekend of November 6-10. The hotel was everything we expected and much more. The location is great and the service is wonderful. They also allowed us to have late check out (2pm).After traveling to NYC many times before, this is now our number one pick for hotels. It's reasonable price, excellent location and friendly staff make it a great choice.You can't go wrong."
467,1778,"Nov 18 2003	Perfect choice!	After much research we selected the Comfort Inn Midtown and we were not disappointed. The rooms were very clean and the bathroom as spacious as your home bath. The marble floors were heated which was nice on cold mornings. This is a small hotel which to me is a feature..easy access to your room, no crowded lobby, individual attention from the front desk when you need it....just a few steps from the outside of your hotel to your room. Believe me after walking all over NYC you don't want to have to walk another block just to get to your room. The continental breakfast included in their rate was quite adequate. Very few hotels offer this in NYC and it is a nice feature to be able to grab a cup of coffee and a fresh pastry and hit the streets! Before coming to New York my second choice for a hotel was the Westin Times Square, so when I arrived I did check it out and I know I made the right decision selecting the Comfort Inn. The Westin is located in a very congested area and not easily accessible....The Comfort Inn is maybe a 1/2 block from Times Square - yet it is remarkably quiet and peaceful - which is very soothing after a long day of noise in NYC. I highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely stay there again."
468,1778,"Nov 12 2003	A Great Choice	This is an excellent choice for New York City. Stayed here on marathon weekend at less than half the price elsewhere in town. The room was very clean. The was staff extremely friendly and helpful. You can walk anywhere from the location. I would recommend this hotel to friends, family and even in-laws without worrying about how they would find the accommodations."

2,1785,"Oct 22 2009 	The Best Week Ever! :)	We (mom, dad, Sister and me) went to new york for 8 days in February to celebrate my dads 50th birthday. We stopped at this hotel and was very impressed from the very start, we had just had a horrendous airport transfer and was very jet lagged. As soon as we arrived at the hotel the doorman couldnt do enough for us, he carried the bags up to the hotel room and came and checked on us to make sure we had settled in well (obviously expecting a tip). The hotel staff were very friendly and couldnt do enough for you weather you wanted tickets booking or just random info. We had a family room x2 double beds, a tv, bathroom and a cupboard (the room was28 stories high!). it was very clean and the maids did a fantastic job! The location is excellent as you are situated right by a subway station and you are next to a supermarket and only a 20 minute slow walk to Times square and 10 minutes from 5th avenue! No where in New york is cheap and the breakfasts in the hotel really were'nt ($18 for breakfast!), theres a McDonalds 1 block down so thats where we ate every day. We were typical tourists and the people are very friendly in shops or just people that live there for some reason they kept on asking us how we felt about whats gong on in the world e.g. Barak Obama, the war, the financial crisis. I guess they just wanted to see how we felt. The atmosphere is awsome in and out of the hotel and would recommend this hotel to anyone, it wasnt cheap but what do you expect for staying in New York City! One last thing dont expcet it to be cheap the restaraunts are so expensive, even little cafe's and leave a tip!, we went into this one cafe near the world trade centre site and the waitress came up to us adn told us we hadnt tipped enough!!!!!"
3,1785,"Oct 9 2009 	Pleasant Clean	This was an impromptu weekend getaway to NYC that we booked the night before on Priceline (name your own price). Given the price we paid, and that it was only rated a 3 star hotel, it was a nice surprise. We asked for a king sized bedroom, which we were given, and it was around the corner from the gym which looked pretty good (but we didn't use it). Carpet, furniture, dresser, bathroom - everything was very clean. A/C worked well. No musty smell that you sometimes get. You can definitely hear the subway running underneath, but it wasn't loud enough to be a bother or rouse us from sleep (and I'm a light sleeper). People who checked us in/out were gracious to us even though we were about 10-15 minutes late in checking out. Right next to the subway station. Room was spacious, with a view toward the street below - nice at night with all the lights. Great place to stay - wouldn't mind staying here again for the same price (~$150/night)."
4,1785,"Oct 8 2009 	The perfect NYC hotel for us	After staying in an absolute dive on our last trip to NYC, the Marriot on 92nd was a palace. We were lucky enough to get an end room (be sure to request one) and it had a 2 windows, one with a view of the East River. It was bright and spacious (unlike many NYC hotels) and had a sofa, refrigerator, coffee maker, etc. It was a great place to return to after a day of touring and was quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful. For us the location was perfect because it was a half block away from our daughter, but it was about a 6 block walk to the nearest subway station. We didn't take the bus, but I imagine one runs close by. An advantage of the location, thought, is that it's only a 15 minute (30 in traffic) ride to LaGuardia. There were plenty of good and not outrageously expensive restaurants in the area within a few blocks as well as some corner markets. There's a coffeeshop type restaurant in the hotel where we went for a decent breakfast. We'll definitely go back!"
5,1785,"Sep 25 2009 	Solid Business Hotel Decent Location	I stayed here this summer since it had a preferred rate with a local hospital. The location is decent, although it is a bit far from the subway (10-15 minute walk). The room was clean and comfortable - actually pretty large for an NYC hotel. Our room had a weird, handicap-accessible bathroom which I assume was due to us getting the hospital rate. Staff was friendly and helpful. Quick tip, go for the $20/night parking at the end of the block rather than the $40/night valet parking. We almost made that mistake. Overall, I'd stay here again if in NYC on business but probably not for personal travel since I'd wanted to be closer to sites and transportation."
6,1785,"Sep 23 2009 	Great hotel wonderful location to move about the city	We were upgraded in advance by David of the front desk to a suite. Im thinking well invite people we know who live in NY over for drinks! No way. Although very nice, the suite did not have a separate living room. It was designed more like a studio apartment with everything in the same room separated by a sort of half wall divider. The room had two large corner windows with a nice view of the East River. The room included a small sofa, modern desk with chair and nice closet. This property had flat screen in the lobby, but not in the room. This hotel is on the Upper East Side at 92 and First Avenue close to good restaurants and public transportation including the Lexington Avenue subway at 86th. Although the photo gives the impression of a tall building, it is not a skyscraper. It is located near several high-rise apartments.This property is great if you need to travel by public transportation. We jumped on the subway to get to the US Open. We also hopped on the express train and rode just two stops to Times Square. We took a taxi one night from a jazz club for about $15 because we didnt feel like dealing with the subway.If you want something to eat, youll find many nice inexpensive good restaurants in the area on Second Avenue going southbound. You get good food by eating where the people who live in the area eat. However, do like the locals try to do, go to breakfast before 11 am. After that time they serve the same food, but raise the prices and dont give away free orange juice. Skip the restaurant coffee and go to the nearby Starbucks for espresso. The hotel included a restaurant and bar on the first floor. It looked sort of dark and sat off to the back area of the lobby. It didnt look interesting at all in terms of going there to eat. The lower level included a gym with a wonderful 50- foot swimming pool at 81 degree water temperature. If youre a swimmer, youll love this pool!"
7,1785,"Sep 23 2009 	Fantastic	I volunteer for a non-profit cervical cancer organization and we were recently in NY to hold our 2nd annual awareness walk. We stayed at a different Marriott last year but decided to try the Courtyard Marriott. I was not in charge of accommodations so I had no idea what to expect. The valet/bellhop was helpful and prompt. Check in was swift even though we had 10+ rooms to confirm. Like someone else mentioned, the elevators are rather slow so be prepared to wait if you are attempting to use during peak traffic times.We had to print some registration forms out for the walk the next day so I took my credit card with me into the business center. I was pleasantly surprised that not only was the use of the computer free, but I could print there for free as well! The hotel even offered free wireless in the rooms. I won't even tell you how much this cost us last year at the other hotel!!! The front desk was extremely helpful. There were certain odds and end items that we forgot and they were happy to let us use them.I did not use the pool nor the gym but they looked very clean and welcoming. I especially liked the view of the pool from the hotel lobby. One thing I wish they would update is that the only ice machine is on the lower level. The hotel is in a residential location so it is quiet (despite the typical horn honking) and safe. I didn't venture out on foot too much so I am unable to speak about any restaurants near the hotel. I ate appetizers at the hotel bar/lounge and had dinner in other locations (Melba's Restaurant was ok and Patsy's Pizza was ok).When we have our next board meeting, I will definitely recommend staying at this location again next year. We got a great rate and the amenities were fantastic."
8,1785,"Aug 21 2009 	Great hotel - wonderful staff	My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights during the last heat wave. Thankfully the air conditioning worked great. The rooms are a bit small but extremely clean and the price was very reasonable for a New York 3 star hotel. Very close to Central Park and Museum Mile. We have visited New York in the past but never had time to visit any of the museums or Central Park. If this type of trip interests you then this is a great location. We went to the Guggenheim, Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Natural History as well as a couple of visits to Central Park. To get anywhere downtown, take any bus across town to Lexington Avenue (about a 20 minute walk). Hop on the Lexington subway at either 86th or 96th and it will take you to the bottom of Manhatten and all places in between. Central Park West is where the great hotels overlooking the park are located including The Dakota. There are numerous deli's close to the hotel including several fine restaurants. If you like Italian then try out Pinnocios - just around the corner on first avenue two blocks south of the hotel. The food was amazing. The only problem we had with the hotel was the elevators - only two and sometimes slow. We stayed on the 15th floor and would recommend you stay at a lower floor if available. The pool and exercise room are fantastic and great for the kids. I would definately recommend this hotel. We got our great deal on Priceline.com. Check it out."
9,1785,"Aug 10 2009 	a wonderful friendly clean hotel	we stayed here after initially staying in a hotel in queens and were impressed with the service and cleanliness of the hotel . nothing was too much trouble, the bell boys were a mine of information so make sure you ask them for tips for seeing new york. it is within walking distance of central park and there are resturants and deli's within a block. the swimming pool and jacuzzi got well used by us with great opening times. the area is residential and quite and you fel perfectly safe walking around. if you want afamily room it is worth phoning the hotel directly because they are not always shown as available on line but as the staff are so accomodating it is worth asking in person ."
10,1785,"Jul 22 2009 	One night stop	Good clean hotel. The rooms were roomy, clean and quiet. A very clean Hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. A little far out of the centre of the city for sight seeing but taxis and bus serices were cheap and good. You could also walk if you wanted too. It felt safe to stay there and walk around day or night."
11,1785,"Jul 21 2009 	Price is Right! Staff is Wrong!!!!	For the price, the hotel is perfect, but the staff doesn't care or doesn't help. When we asked for the number for grand central station, they gave us directions to their business center so that we could google it. This is awful customer service, and I think with the beautiful location and great property that with an aligned staff they might actually be a great hotel. Unfortunately, not the case."
12,1785,"Jul 16 2009 	We made the BEST CHOICE	The Courtyard has been the best choice for us!!! After extensive reading of reviews at TripAdvisor and other sites...I felt we could not go wrong w/ this location. And we were right!!!It is convenient to get around Manhattan....on a pleasant street that is not too crowded or noisy. Right next door is a pharmacy/convenience store for drinks, snacks, etc!!!! And beyond that as well as across the street is a subway entrance......so very easy to get to Times Square, the theatres, Central Park, etc......I did my homework.....and it paid off!!! Booking our flight + this hotel really saved money!!! (I used Travelocity)The front desk staff is friendly...asking how our day was when we return each time. Our needs have all been met......and we have the room to spread out! We have three adults....my husband and I plus an 18 year old teen. The king room w/ a sofa bed was perfect!"
13,1785,"Jul 1 2009 	Not the kind of hotel I would book for my own vacation	I would call this a plain vanilla hotel. It had a variety of customers--business people, families. The lobby was usually busy if not chaotic. Only 2 elevators and you had to use your room key for security purposes to get to your floor. The room was quiet and clean. It was a chain so nothing unique about it but functional and was fine for a one night stay."
14,1785,"Jun 24 2009 	Friendly staff clean great choice on Upper East Side	My husband and I had a great weekend here. The front desk staff was extremely courteous and helpful. The room was very clean, and by Manhattan standards, it was quite spacious. And if you're a swimmer, bring your suit, because the indoor pool is actually shaped for lap swimming. For our needs, the location was perfect. But if you plan to be in midtown Manhattan during most of your stay, or have to be within a block of a subway stop, then you should probably think of a midtown hotel."
15,1785,"Jun 20 2009 	Decent hotel for a couple of nights but nothing special	Overall this was a clean, friendly hotel with excellent service. Reception were always happy to answer any of our questions and did so thoroughly. They were also very helpful to the point that when we went to get the key for the mini bar from reception, they advised us that the mini bar was expensive and that we would be better off going across the road to get some beers, and that they would provide us with a small fridge for our room which they did by the time we got back. The rooms were quite small with hardly any room to move around, however we did have two queen size beds.The hotel is within walking distance of Central Park and the underground lines, although it does take half an hour to an hour to get into town. All in all it was a pleasant stay but I am sure there are a number of hotels in the same category around New York."
16,1785,"Jun 19 2009 	Great location great staff great stay all together	My mother and daughter (11y.o) and I went on a &quot;girl trip&quot; to NYC. This hotel was in a perfect place with neighborhood surrounding it and MD offices. Also, it is VERY safe to walk out at night here to go to a local resturant for dinner. It is about 4 blocks up to Central Park and not that far from the Metropolitan. Good place on 2nd &amp; 92nd to get pizza (Delizia) The staff was excellent and attentive. They assisted us with forgotten items and a hotel car back to LGA. The hotel resturant offers a great breakfast at a reasonable price and it is huge so you can split an omlet if you want. I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay at the Courtyard."
17,1785,"Jun 1 2009 	Good place to stay for seeing the museums	Courtyard upper east side made my stay in my favorite city all that more enjoyable. For once I was not traveling for business and I picked this location purely because of it's proximity to museum mile.The courtyard is nestled on the northern end of the upper east side by east Harlem. It is a short distance from Central Park and from museum mile. It is also a reasonable cab fare from the airports; in my case LGA.The lobby was nice, nothing special. The staff was friendly.The rooms are small by North American standards, regular sized for NYC. Everything was very clean. The bathroom was good sized and had minimal toiletries. The bed was very comfortable. The view was fair. There is a weighted mini bar with snacks and drinks. No refrigerator or microwave. The desk included a free wired internet hook up with a cord that doesn't reach beyond the desk. The safe in the closet isn't big enough for regular sized laptops.In New York it's all about location and for me it was perfect and the price was fair for a major chain. If you are going to the common tourist attractions that are in lower Manhattan this hotel is quite a bit north for those activities.It was an average hotel for an average price so I gave it an average rating."
18,1785,"May 21 2009 	Would have rated higher but...	...they didn't respond to my concerns about safety. On the last day (of 4), my door stuck, and we were trapped in the room. We called down to the front desk, and they sent a security guard up. I was able to get the door open as he arrived, and he looked at and talked to me like I was idiot for not knowing how to use a lock, and said he'd have maintenance look at it. When we came back a few hours later to check out, the same thing happened. This time, we had to get the housekeepers to let us out through the adjoining room, and they mentioned that they knew that that room did that from time to time. When I talked to a manager about it, saying it was a major fire hazard, he apologized profusely, and said he'd look into it. After I got home, I wrote a review on another site, and only then got an e-mail from another manager at the hotel, who offered me another apology and said he'd refund a night's stay. Surprise, surprise... almost 1 year later, I still haven't seen that refund."
19,1785,May 19 2009 	A happy customer despite . . .	It was a pleasant stay for me (2 nights). The room is good size considering that it is in Manhattan. The subway is less than 10 mins (walk) away and there are numerous amenites nearby. It also provide free internet access in the room. The staff and service were good. The only shortcoming was the heating system in my room was malfunciton. I would recommed this hotel to visitors who are looking for value for money hotel.
20,1785,"May 17 2009 	Great Place To Stay	I surprised my daughter for her 18th Birthday with a weekend in NYC. We went to see the Broadway Show, Jersey Boys - which I recommend everyone to see - Phenomenal Show! We arrived and our room was available. Lovely view. We were on the 27th Floor. The cafe for breakfast was a bit pricey for their buffet. I wasn't impressed with the breakfast buffet for the price. The gym was nice. The bar was good. The computer area is good, as well. The convince of the transportation was excellent. Subway on the corner, bus stop a block away. Restaurants close by. Museum and other sightseeing sites close by. We walked everywhere and enjoyed the hotel and sites. I would definitely stay here again. Staff was great! Duane Reade next door. You had everything at your fingertips."
21,1785,"Feb 17 2009 	Obnoxious buzzing sound (from ventilation system) plagued stay - Management NO help	I stayed at this hotel this past weekend, and I was disappointed by what I found, however, my disappointment was tempered by the fact that I paid only $105 (Priceline) for my room. Had I paid the rack rate, I would have sobbed.The aesthetics and layout of the room were fine, and it was roomy by New York standards. The view was nothing special (7th floor, looking at adjacent building) - Im sure we got the Priceline special.There hotel did have some pluses, but, unfortunately, there were also several BIG flaws that would prevent me from staying here again.1. The fan controlling the heating and air conditioning periodically buzzed/alarmed LOUDLY every couple of hours. This made sleeping very difficult. The first night when it happened, I woke up in a half daze, first thinking it was my phone and later thinking it was a building alarm of some sort. It took me awhile to figure out where it was coming from. The next morning, I spoke to the management and was told that there was nothing that could be done  the owner of the building was cheap apparently and had installed shoddy ventilation. The buzzing sound was normal and to be expected. We would just have to deal with it. I was pretty disappointed with that response as being able to sleep through the night is something I value. 2. On another noise issue, the insulation in the walls is not very good. Our neighbors were loud and obnoxious and continued to enter/exit their room until the early hours of the morning. Again, not good for sleep and just plain annoying. I so wanted to go yell at them to make up their mind  are you in or out?!3. When we left our luggage after check out we came back to find it (as well as numerous others) just sitting in the lobby. The bellhop told us that they had run out of space and were just stacking it by the hotel entrance. This wasnt exactly comforting especially because he didnt ask for tags or ID when we took our luggage, so basically anyone could just walk in and take a bag.Also, not a big flaw, but a small one  the hotel didnt have any hand lotion or a shower cap. I kind of thought these things were standard in three star hotels?The general area of the hotel is okay and the subway is a bit of a hike. You can take the bus, but its unreliable. If youre not in a hurry the bus in an excellent way to get around. Otherwise, youre stuck with the overcrowded subway on Lexington. We found the hotel to be too much of a hike to go back and forth to during the day. Once we left were out until night. In retrospect, it would have been nicer to be a little closer in. Also, there is small market adjacent to the hotel that was an excellent place to get snacks and water. With a little bit more walking, you can easily reach a variety of dining establishments, drugstores and markets. I didnt find the area the most interesting or lively, but it was equipped with the basic things you would want."
22,1785,"Feb 17 2009 	Happy Stay	I decided to stay here after reading good reviews from Tripadvisor members. But after taking a taxi from Penn Station, I realized how far from downtown it was. Even the nearest subway station is far. When I checked in, I was given a room on the lowest floor, and when I saw the room, I felt claustrophobic. I was warned about the tiny rooms at this hotel, so I wasn't totally surprised. This is a Courtyard Marriott and most rooms at Courtyards are not this small. But this is New York. Though small, the room is actually quite nice. It's got everything you need. Free Internet, a safe for laptops, plenty of stores and restaurants around the hotel. I could even open the window slightly to let in the cool air. Since I was on the lowest floor, I didn't have to worry about making too much noise on the floor. Of course, there was no view, just the gym next door. I really picked this hotel to be close to Central Park, which is a couple blocks away. Even though it is far from downtown, I like the room and the area around the hotel. It's another area of New York City, which I can consider staying next time."
23,1785,"Jan 11 2009	An out-of-the-way treat	Let me start out by saying: if you really need to be near Times Square or tourist attractions, this won't be the hotel for you. But for those who are familiar with the city or who enjoy exploring non-touristy urban neighborhoods, this is a real find.We checked in for the second half of a business-pleasure trip after a poor experience at a 4-star in Times Square, where we'd been staying (without choice) for a convention. The Courtyard Upper East, while technically fewer stars, was so much better. The rooms are lovely -- super clean and I really liked the decor. Very comfy beds, plus the happy bonus of free (wired) internet access and free access to a fitness room, plus a handy coin-op washer-dryer on-site. But the real joy here was the service. The hotel has a friendly, outgoing, and dedicated staff. We had some minor requests (luggage rack, missing shower curtain hooks, stuck door on mini-fridge), which were fully handled each time in 10 minutes or less by friendly and efficient staff. When we encountered staff in the elevator, they introduced themselves by name and asked if we needed anything, as well as encouraging us to call on them for any needs during the stay. From the front desk, to the super housekeepers, to the maintenance and other staff -- everyone we encountered made us feel like we were staying in a family-run hotel instead of a chain.This neighborhood isn't going to be for everyone -- like much of upper Manhattan the rich and poor live closely together, with housing projects and fancy luxury high-rises literally next-door to each other -- but it worked well for us. It's definitely a long hike to the subway, but as former New Yorkers we were already familiar with the bus system (M31 and M86 almost at the door, the latter can take you to and from the 86th St stop on the Lexington line, or across town to the West Side), and taxis were abundant at all times except a.m. rush. Along with the Jersey City Hyatt, this will now be our &quot;go-to&quot; hotel choice in New York. Kudos and thanks for a terrific stay to everyone at the Courtyard Upper East Side. We'll be back!"
24,1785,"Jan 2 2009 	hated the Marriott	not the best hotel by any stretch. I hated my stay here.rooms v cramped, air con really noisy, Too noisy for window to be left open also as there a main road running opp the hotel. Those ridiculous mini bars which charge you if you even just open anything so you are unable to use it to store anything. shower and bathroom really old. no room service or restaurant or bar in hotel. restaurant adjacent to hotel where you can get breakfast which is ok. towels were horribly rough every day.not cheap considering how bad the hotel is. gym not good and sauna never on. On the upside, the staff were extremely nice and the beds were comfy. could have used some extra blankets though.Also within a few minutes walk to a subway which is good."
25,1785,"Jan 1 2009 	Excellent stay	Everything was excellent!!! Every single staff member we encountered were courteous and helpful. Rooms were very clean. Room was a little small...so much so that the 27&quot; TV seemed a little big for the room. However, the room was big enough to serve it's purpose. The breakfast at the restaurant downstairs was excellent. However, they do not serve alcohol at the bar...but no big deal. The nearest subway station is only a 15 minute walk away. This was the best hotel experience i've ever had. Will definately come back and recommend to anyone."
26,1785,Oct 30 2008 	Quiet and clean	Stayed here for 8 nights. The staff very friendly. Room comfortable. Free internet great. It was quiet which was good as I am a light sleeper. We were on the 12th floor and had quite a nice view. The only thing is that it is a 20 min walk to subway. Then quite a way to the main attractions. We don't mind walking but it would've been nice to be a bit more central. You can't really know until you are there and find out where everything is. We did get a weekly subway pass which was definately worthwhile and taxis are cheap compared to London!
27,1785,"Oct 21 2008 	Great stay on the Upper East Side	We stayed at this hotel for a girl's weekend when we couldn't get into the Marriott Marquis down in Times Square and had a great time. The hotel is very nice and looks fairly new. We didn't expect it to have a pool and wished we would have brought our suits. The rooms were very nice. The three of us stayed in a room with two double beds and had plenty of room to move around. There was no concierge but the front desk staff was very knowledgeable about the city and gave us great suggestions and directions. We would definitely stay here again. After seeing the craziness of Times Square, we were glad we chose the Courtyard."
28,1785,"Aug 29 2008 	Great place	Extremely courteous and helpful staff. Nice small restaurant attached to hotel is really an excellent value for NYC. Had a large omelette with sausage, cheese, and vegetables for $8.50, which included toast and hash browns. Mom had oatmeal with raisins and brown sugar for $3.50. Also had dinner there, with most items under $20.Staff provided a complimentary fridge on request.24hr. gym, swimming pool, and coffee/tea/hot chocolate service on lower level. Also washers and dryers."
29,1785,"Aug 19 2008 	Great hotel not great location	I stay here overnight just for fun. It was a beautiful hotel and actually pretty big. The staff was very nice and the overnight parking wasn't too expensive. The only thing is that it's very difficult to get to see broadway and the tourist scenes ( it's a nice walk over to central park) because this hotel is far away. So, if you're looking for a hotel in the upper east area, this one is great. If you want to explore nyc more, I'd stay in times square."
30,1785,"Aug 17 2008 	Great Area Very Good Hotel	Came here for a week on business with Cornell/Weill Medical Center on York and 68th, and this was by far a better location than where my colleagues stayed in Times Square. I agree with most the previous reviews - this is a nice inexpensive Courtyard ($279/nite) in a safe and very quiet (by NY standards) neighborhood that is walkable with lots of nice restaurants nearby and has easy access to bus service and 6 blocks to the subway. The room was small (my biggest complaint) by most standards but typical for NYC (about 15x15) - definitely not the typical Courtyard size and not made for more than 2 people. The bathroom (also small) was modern with good water pressure and the hot water was always hot. The bed was comfortable and the service was excellent. It was extremely clean. Front desk staff were always helpful and very courteous. My wife developed a rapport with our maid who was a sweetheart and a genuinely nice person. Always ate out for breakfast at one of the nearby restaurants or bagel shop, so cannot comment on restaurant. Had some dinners away and some nearby (Zebu Grill was excellent - one block away). After seeing what a mass of people and noise Times Square is, I am glad we stayed here and would do so again. P.S. the taxi ride from LaGuardia was only $18, and there was always a car service or taxi outside, sometimes many."
31,1785,"Aug 7 2008 	Great stay---but 1 glaring error.	Went for 4 days in late July.The staff was incredible---as usual for a Marriott.Special kudos to Diana who was in touch with me and communicating with me from about 4 days before I came to the check in---of which she was there.A more lovely and charming person, you will never find.The pool is fantastic when not packed with little kids and the whirpool is great. So is the steam room.On the down side---there was not the usual Marriott breakfast buffet. Was a regular restaurant type thing with paying for each entree. PLUS---amazingly, they do not have a liquor license and thus----no bar/lounge.That part bugged me.There's no better way to get the flavor of a city, then getting to know and talk to and share, with the bartender and it's customers from all over the world.The service and people were fine, especially the queen of that restaurant, Shell. She is a joy to see every breakfast.It is about a $20 cab ride to anything of note, (Circle Line, Times Square, etc...). Was too hot to always take the subway---tho we did for the Yankee;s game. Is only 4 stops from subway station.Rooms were spotless and great beds.Elevator system worked very well too for a hotel of 16 floors.Finally--- business center computers, were FREE! Were always in use tho.Was a nice place overall..Ren"
32,1785,"Aug 3 2008 	Great for the quiet neighborhood and overnite stay.	This was for an overnite stay with my sister/bro-inlaw for their anniversary. Due to the occasion, Mgmt upgraded them to a Suite, which is more spacious, better view and with a little LR area, with a bottle of wine. They loved it, and I was glad they did. Our room was small but OK, not a great view, but we weren't there for staying in. We went to B'way for the nite, and the hotel recommended Timothy's Restaurant around the corner for breakfast. Huge portions of food and great prices. It's a 5 minute leisurely walk, and definitely worth it. The staff is VERY pleasant, helpful, and I'd like to see them cloned for other Marriott properties - really nice folks. This is a quieter neighborhood than the B'Way area hotels, but so worth it, even with the taxi ride, which cost $7 each way.The lobby is minimalist, modern, and there's a pool and gym we didn't get to enjoy. For a clean, quiet place, you get your money's worth in the NYC area.I'd stay here again, even tho the local SPCA is next door - some doggies disembarked from their transportation and did their business in front of the SPCA; just be careful."
33,1785,"Jul 31 2008 	Good and not so good	My Grandson and I just stayed 3 days at the end of July to take in a Yankees game and do some sight seeing(never been there before), the complete staff there was very friendly from bell boys to room maids... Rooms were a little small but nice for two, any more then that get a suite...Pool/steam room/sauna and fitness center were great but closed way too early, 9PM sharp, no chance for adults to unwind from a long day of sight seeing. the hotel building is sort of sandwiched in by 30+ store high rises and being only 15 stories high itself there is not that great a view from any room .....Walked around the neighborhood and hit some restaurants with no problems at all, nice people and no one bothered us! The restaurant on the premises is a joke with a limited menu, I never saw anyone in there my whole stay but we went there for breakfast anyway, I just ordered eggs/waffles/coffee for two and with the tip was $35, I ordered wheat bread and I had to wait till someone ran to the store to buy a loaf...TVs were new 27&quot; flat screen but the cable only had around 20 channels, self parking in a rip off, the parking lot is a half a block away and everyone there speaks limited English, I left two hours before my 24 hours were up and yet they charged me an extra $20 and couldn't explain why to me, Everyone told me to take the train or subway around town, but I didn't have any problems driving/parking at Yankee Stadium, Coney Island or downtown Manhattan, it took about an hour getting into New York City over the GW bridge on Sunday but leaving we made it over and into NJ in less then 15 minutes(no toll) Tip, if your driving around town, taxi drivers are fearless and will cut you off in a moment's notice with no fear of hitting you just to get their next fare, looking at local cars in New York City most every car we saw new or old had a dent, I left unscathed...lol"

35,1785,"Jul 4 2008	Exceptional Service	On May 30th a friend of mine stayed in this hotel for one night after being evacuated from her apartment following a construction crane collapse in her neighborhood. While I didn't stay at the hotel, I did help her to check-in, and also got to explore the hotel a little. First and foremost, the front desk staff couldn't have been better. Even with an emergency in the neighborhood, they calmly and efficiently moved people from one room to another, and were kind and considerate to those who had been displaced. They never took advantage of the emergency situation by hiking up the price, and I thought for Manhattan the price was very reasonable. Special kudos to Daisy at the front desk who checked my friend in and was very helpful and accommodating. All in all, if the employees are even half as professional during a normal day and a normal check-in, then they are as professional as any hotel in Manhattan.The room and bathroom were very clean and while not big, was enough for one or two people. I didn't know what to expect from a Courtyard Marriott in NYC, but I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a clean, modern looking place to stay at a reasonable rate. This is not a full-service hotel, but you're in New York and within walking distance of many restaurants. It's also not the Four Seasons or the Gansevoort, but you're also not paying $600 a night (at least). The location is far from the subway, but there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel and has easy access to many of the Upper Eastside museums (the Met, the Frick, etc). It's one block from the East river and Gracie Mansion, which is good for joggers. All in all, it's a good choice if you want to pay a reasonable rate and don't mind not being in mid-town and instead being around real New Yorkers."
36,1785,"Jun 7 2008 	Great for business or a vacation	I stayed for almost a week at the Courtyard Marriott while in town on business and had a fairly spacious (for New York) room with two queen beds, looking out on Ninety-second Street. I needed to work while at the hotel and there was a reliable and fast Internet connection for my laptop. The bathroom was clean and pleasant, with a granite sink and mirrors galore. I had a moment of panic thinking there was no hair dryer, but it was hidden behind some towels. There were plenty of clean towels supplied daily, for once more than I needed. Beds were comfortable, and you are able to set your own temperature in the room, a definite plus. Really, the room was so up to date and functional you wouldn't believe you were in a New York hotel room. Free copies of the newspaper downstairs and a well-decorated lobby. The staff was fast, polite and efficient; I never had to wait at the front desk. Step out onto First Avenue and you'll find all kinds of restaurants. Down side? It is a hike to the subway, about 15 minutes on foot, and it can take awhile to hail a cab even on nearby First Avenue. There was no refrigerator in the room though it looked like there used to be, and for long stays you really, really want a refrigerator. The elevators tend to be slow and verrrrrrry crowded in the morning. Noise leaked through the windows from the street, and started early. All in all, though, I'd happily return, though I'd bring my comfortable shoes for walking to the subway."
37,1785,"May 13 2008 	Do not get stuck with a lower floor facing the back .	This is a new hotel if they only added two feet more per room it could be comfortable. The rooms are cramped, no space for your luggage. The rooms on the lower floors in the back of the hotel face a filthy courtyard and look right into apartments. You must keep the drapes closed for privacy. I would not accecpt this again. The front rooms face apts but you have plenty of privacy with a nice view of trees and sky. The beds are comfy with lots of pillows. The windows keep any noise out. Bathroom rooms sparkle.Good for museums but far from bway theater.,"
38,1785,"May 9 2008 	Extraordinary Service...!	Loved our seven day stay at this particular Courtyard. A little rocky start upon arrival, but thanks to an incredible young staff member, Matthew McNeil, he quickly addressed the room problem, gave us information about the area, restaurants, subway, buses,and theater tickets. His demeanor was fun but always professional, and always &quot;just enough&quot;. And he was there in the evening just when he was needed. The location was definitely apart from many of the places we planned to visit, but New York is such an incredible easy walking city, we quickly got where we needd to be. Subway a good 10-15 minute walk. Buses, however, to get you to the subway stop almost directly in front of the hotel.Rooms were just the right size for two and made up daily with no difficulty as to time. The rest of the staff was also very pleasant, but Mr. McNeil was to be commended for making this an extra special stay. Funny what personal contact does to make you feel at home.Take advantage of the nearby restaurants they recommend when you have no definite plans. Try not to stroll too late at night to the upper-upper east side as it tends to be less appealing for non-New Yorkers."
39,1785,"May 1 2008 	Excellent Family Stay!	All around - Great! We stayed here with our children, 5-7-9, and friends were shocked to hear we found a hotel in NYC, with a pool, that we could afford. The hotel was wonderfully maintained, the staff was very friendly, it was quiet, the subway was w/in 6 blocks, and there were plenty of restaurants to hop out for breakfast. As my son said, the room didn't need to be large because there was so much to do outside the hotel. Beds were comfortable, housekeeping was meticulous, and the location was just enough out of the fray. And hey - we parked the car for only $20/day! A terrific stay."
40,1785,"Apr 22 2008 	A nice place to stay in the big city	We spent only one night at the Courtyard by Marriott Upper East Side, but it was completely problem- and stress-free. Our room was immaculate, quiet and, by Manhattan standards, commodious. As others have noted, the bed was very comfortable and the water pressure excellent. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. Prior to our visit, we received an email with all kinds of useful information pertaining to hotel and neighborhood amenities. The hotel's location is very convenient for visiting the museums on the Upper East Side, which was the main reason for our visit. We liked the hotel's immediate neighborhood, too -- a little off the beaten track, but with every convenience nearby (restaurants, groceries, and, with the hotel's validation, reasonably priced parking). In fact -- again, by Manhattan standards -- our entire stay was reasonably priced for such a nice place, just under $300 for one night including all taxes. And when our stay was over, it was easy to &quot;escape&quot; the city, with an entrance onto FDR Drive just at the end of the street."
41,1785,"Apr 22 2008 	Affordable Comfortable NY	In a city where $300 will buy you small regrets, in the Upper Side of NY ,there is a Courtyard, where for $240 you can find a newly renovated, very comfortable king size bed in a room that by NY standards can be considered unbelievably large. You do have to accept the fact that you are in 92nd Street, not exactly in the center of the action, and just barely out of the fanciest part of town; of course that depends what you consider the action, because it is very close to the Metropolitan , Central Park and the subway.The bed is extemely comfortable, as is the room in general, and you can actually turn around in the bathroom, which is also very comfortable, another surprise in NY. There is a rather basic supply of toiletries, three little bottles, in fact, but plenty of towels and a coffee maker. Someone removed the fridge, or whatever was under that coffee maker.Parking is actually possible around there, and they even have self parking for $20.This is a great place to stay in NY , new, clean, pleasant ,and affordable."
42,1785,"Apr 6 2008 	Great hotel!	We had a wonderful stay. You feel welcome from the first moment. All the staff is really helpful, the rooms are clean, good in size and with comfortable beds and linen. Very nice pool and dont miss the gym! A lot of good restaurants in the neighborhood (best Mecixan ever!! not to forget the Italian...). For breakfast Madison Ave and 91st!The location is good, quiet, you are in the &quot;real&quot; NYC together with the NewYorkers, not with a bunch of tourist. Take the sub, a bus or a cab and your in downtown in a short time. We loved it and will be back."
43,1785,"Feb 29 2008 	Great location for visiting museums	I stayed at this hotel one night on business earlier this week and was very pleased with the hotel. A friend who lives in New York said she was surprised that there were hotels this far east, but I would certainly stay here again. The location of the hotel was very convenient for me and I was delighted to be so close to 'Museum Mile', about a 5-10 minute walk away and public transportation (buses and subway are not far). The lobby has a clean, modern look and was inviting. Check-in/check-out were very smooth and all the staff were helpful and courteous. The room was great -- again, furnished in a spare, modern look. What a relief to see that hotels are finally getting rid of the dreaded bedspreads that no one wants to go near! It would have been nice to have a fridge in the room though. That said, drinks and snacks are available for purchase in the lobby."
44,1785,"Feb 20 2008 	Great location for Upper East Side business	As small business owners with a customer in the upper east 90's we booked a room for a recent project. From a business trip standpoint everything was great! Very professional staff - everyone went out of their way to make you feel welcome. Local restaurants abound - however, since our trip was on Valentine's Day - the places I had found in Zagats were busy. The front desk started calling and secured a reservation at a newly opened local upscale diner. Timmy's Grill is a real find. They also deliver to the hotel. If you need to check email - bring your own laptop (the rooms have wired internet). There is a business center in the lobby - but only 1 terminal and it is a first come first serve."
45,1785,"Feb 4 2008 	Best Hotel Experience in NY @ GREAT Price!!!!!	I booked online and got a great rate. From my experience staying at NYC hotels in the past this hotel was a very pleasant surprise. I walked in and found that I was in a modern, hip lobby w/ plasma TV's and STYLE!The room was CLEAN, which is more than what I expected and looked very new. The colors were a nice change of pace too.They had a very inviting looking pool, spa and exercise area (not that I used it). I did utilize the sauna which was so relaxing after a day of walking around NYC.All in all, this was a great hotel with LOTS of modern conveniences and flair. If you want a NICE place in NYC at a good price, stay here!"
46,1785,"Jan 10 2008 	Love New York	We stayed at this hotel for a week in mid November, and it was great. The staff were friendly and helpful. They Yorkville bar next door served great brekkies and dinners. There is also a great Italian restaurant about 2 blocks up E92 street. The best Pasta ever. It was a little out of the way, but a quick cab ride was all it took for us (4) to get into Times Square and no more tham $20, except the night beforeThanksgiving. All in all a great place to stay and would recommend it to any traveller. Clean and comfortable rooms, even if they are small, but it is all you need."
47,1785,"Jan 1 2008 	Too small rooms	Our family (two parents and two teen-aged children) stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Upper East Side for three nights between Christmas and New Year's Day. The room was considerably smaller than expected. A roll-away bed had been requested at the time of the on-line booking but upon check-in, we were told that the rooms were too small to accommodate roll-aways. We would not have booked if that limitation was known--so why did Marriott offer that option on their web-site for this specific hotel? That is misleading the customer. Will not stay here again as a family."
48,1785,"Dec 29 2007 	Another wonderful stay.	Our second stay this year, would like to return again and again.Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms extremely clean and well equipped, with comfy bedding. Great shower and water pressure, luxury towels and soaps. Standard room with two queen is small like a typical NYC hotel room. Free computer with internet and laser printer in the lobby, wired internet available in room but no wireless.Good, reasonably priced food at Yorkville cafe and bar downstairs, but breakfast service during both stays was slow and inattentive. Good local restaurants abound.Health club, indoor pool and large hot tub spa in lower level of the hotel, continue to be a hit with our children and visiting cousins who live in NY area. One minor complaint was the air temperature around the pool. Our last stay was July 2007, and this was not a problem, but a bit chilly in Dec. Hotel would benefit from better concierge services for event and theatre tickets. We are attracted to the Courtyard partly for luxury at discount prices, we expect the same in entertainment value.If you don't mind being out of the city center, E92 at 1st Ave, this a great hotel in the city and the staff are truly wonderful."
49,1785,"Dec 13 2007 	Good ...but expensive for what it was when we stayed	We picked this hotel based upon the high Trip Advisor rating and the fact that it was family-friendly. I always find it difficult to give a hotel a rating because the criterion are relative depending upon where you are, with wide variations in quality and amenities across both countries and continents. Make no mistake however, this is a good hotel. Equally, this is no five star hotel. The location, being within a few blocks of Bloomingdales, Saks, Tiffany and the Chrysler building is excellent. The hotel is a fantastic choice for families. The beds are comfortable and the rooms spotlessly clean, bathrooms are functional if not luxurious The views are good (although no sign of the Chrysler Buidling from room 2508 where we were). As described previously, the staff are efficient although by no means exceptionally so.So what is the problem? Well none really aside from the fact that I was paying $600 (300) + tax per night for what is a mid-range chain hotel. Perhaps the comparison is unfair, particularly given the fact that we probably visited NYC on the busiest weekend of the year, but I couldn't help expecting more for the money. I have read gushing reviews but where people paid half of this rate or less for rooms here. That would be fair value but we could find nothing on Priceline, Hotwire etc that came close. Perhaps we have been spolied by what you get in Singapore or the Far East for 300 (true 5 star luxury).We too got the hotel car back to JFK at $55 inclusive of toll but excluding tip and this was a good choice after the world's smelliest cab on arrival! Also, for breakfast, the hotel kindly recommended Maddison's which is two blocks away on 1st Avenue. We ended up having breakfast there three times and it was a fantastic experience with great American breakfasts (bacon, two eggs and hash browns for $7 with unlimited coffee) and a real '50's ambiance.All in all, I would return to the Courtyard. It's a good hotel and our family enjoyed it but I would not pay $600 plus tax per night for it. If you can get it for a more reasonable rate, do not hesitate to stay there - particularly if you are a family with children."
50,1785,"Nov 29 2007 	OK but out of the action (business and tourist)	Picked this hotel for a business trip as it was $150 cheaper than mid-town hotels (still a not cheap $420/night) of similar quality (and even some of lower quality).Room was nice, but small. No complaints. My only complaint was the distance from mid-town, the subway, etc. On a rainy day the door man got me a car (as opposed to a taxi) which cost $30 to go to midtown. Another day the taxi was a more reasonable $17. On evening I took the subway, and would up walking for about 20 minutes. I would only recommend this hotel if you have a specific reason to be in this neighborhood as there is nothing &quot;special&quot; about it (except the cost savings)."
51,1785,"Nov 25 2007 	Great place to stay	We stayed at this Marriott over the Thanksgiving holiday and were very impressed. The front desk staff was courrteous and friendly, the rooms were comfortable and scrupulously clean. We've stayed at a wide variety of NYC hotels over the years and this one was the best by far. Highly recommended."
52,1785,"Nov 21 2007 	Excellent hotel!!!	I booked this hotel on Marriott.com when I was searching for hotels in NYC and this was the most cost effective. When I arrived I found out that the hotel was just a year old and had been built from the ground up so it has all of the modern amenities that I wanted: individual temperature control panel in my room; high speed internet in my room (and it was FREE!) The lobby is beautiful and spacious; the entire back wall is clear glass panels that overlook their indoor pool (unheard of in NYC). I got down to their lower level and found that in addition to the pool they also have a hot tub, sauna &amp; steam room!! My room was clean, comfortable, and spacious for NYC standards and the bed was SO comfortable, I slept like a baby. They should sell those linens-I owuld have bought some. The staff was friendly and had lots of information on what to see/do (not that it's hard to find something to do in NYC). I was within walking distance of a bunch of museums so we decided to walk over to the Met &amp; the Guggenheim. 2nd Avenue has lots of great restauraunts as well if you get hungry. The subway sounded like it was far away but when we walked it we got there really fast (5-7 minutes). Oh, and the valet parking was cheap in comparison to other hotels that I priced ($40 and unlimited amount of times that you can take the car in &amp; out per day).If you want a great hotel in NYC at a great price you should consider this one."
53,1785,"Nov 5 2007	Clean big 	After some nights midtown at La Quinta, this hotel was like paradise. Yes it is some distance from subways, Broadway and Times Square but with some exercise, it was relatively convenient to walk to Metropolitan Museum of Art and across Central Park to Museum of Natural History and walk to Roosevelt Island tram. We walked a lot in NY. There were numerous restaurants in the area for breakfast, lunch and dinner with reasonable prices and good food. I would definitely recommend it."
54,1785,"Oct 23 2007 	Excellent hotel but far away from everything	I satyed in this hotel with my wife for two nights as the Farm Aid concert was held in Randall's Island.The hotel is very nice and it is located in a very quiet spot of NYC. It is actually Yorkville and not the upper east side. It has plenty of diners and restaurants around, but it is quite away from everything.Our room was very nice, it was actually more an apartment than a regular room (it had a fridge and a kitchenette), and quite big Our stay was very comfortable and the staff was very nice and helpful."
55,1785,"Aug 21 2007 	Awesome rate pretty far away from anything	My boyfriend and I booked this hotel for $100 through priceline the night before! The rates online were going for $299+. The self service parking is steps away and $20, why would you even bother doing $40 for valet! The hotel is almost next door to the ASPCA as seen on Animal Planet, we almost adopted a cat while we were there! Check in was smooth they didnt even ask for a drivers license, the hotel lobby is big and beautiful, clean the pool looks great although we didnt go in it. There are only 3 computers in the lobby w/ internet access and we were waiting a lot times to use them. Our room was 713 right by the elevator which worried me, but we didnt hear a sound! Also great security is you can only use the elevator if you swipe your card. the view was ehhh, but the bed was SOOO comfortable we had a late check out and could have slept all day!!! The only downside is even though we were seeing a concert in central park on 70th st. we still had to take cabs everywhere - the nearest subway is about 4 blocks and 2 aves away, just too far to walk. IF you dont mind paying for cabs i would totally reccomend this hotel. We loved it , the room wasn't that small at all!! I'm trying to get the priceline rate again (the staff quietly mentioned it when i checked out, they werent rude or loud as previosuly stated about it.) You don't even realize there are projects across the street either."
56,1785,"Aug 19 2007 	great for the price	Every summer we take the kids into Manhattan for the weekend to visit my brother and his wife. We recently stayed at the Courtyard/Upper East Side. We have stayed in several different hotels in NYC, this was the least expensive, and we chose it for the price. I was a little concerned with the location because I was unsure of the safety of the area, and we stayed in a Courtyard Marriott a few months before in NJ and had a bad experience with this particular hotel chain.The location was not bad at all, it seemed safe, and there were always plenty of cabs waiting outside. The hotel staff was friendly, and our room was ready well before check in time. The room was very clean and brand new, definately a much better experience then the other Courtyard we stayed at.The room was small, but this is NYC, and it was probably an old building. Plus, we spent hardly any time in the room, so the size was not an issue. This hotel had a pool onsite, which my kid's loved. It was brand new and very clean.The price was great for what we got, and we would likely stay at this location again."
57,1785,"Aug 16 2007 	Good Hotel; Decent Price; Far from Many Attractions	It is a newly-redone hotel and was perfectly acceptable. It had a good exercise room and even a small lap pool. The room was very small, even by Manhattan standards, but it was decently appointed, the bed was very comfortable, and the ample windows made it feel bigger. If I strained, I could see a piece of the East River from our room. The staff was very pleasant and helpful, particularly the bell staff.The issue for us was the location - in the lower 90s on the Upper East Side near First Avenue, in the quiet, predominantly residential area known as Yorkville. If you are driving, you will find the hotel close to FDR Drive, but it is far from any of the usual tourist attractions  Times Square, the Theater District, Greenwich Village, South Street Seaport, etc. A round-trip cab ride to Little Italy for dinner was about $38 with tip. Even the nearest subway station is on the 4, 5, and 6 lines that run up Lexington Avenue, about 10 blocks from the hotel. There are some acceptable restaurants in the area (we liked Caf DAlsace on Second Avenue), but dont count on anything in the way of shopping or night life. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is probably the closest attraction, and that is about 18 blocks."
58,1785,"Jul 24 2007 	Good Deal for the discount	The Hotel was good, we had no problems. Having read prior reviews about construction, I asked for a room far away from the 4th floor and they kindly gave us the 15th, so there were no noise issues. The rooms were clean, the staff was nice.Some people say it is far away, but we're Bostonians and walk all the time anyways so to us, well we love a nice walk anyways. Walking through the Upper East Side strolling to deli's and shops on our way to the museums and Central Park was wonderful. If you have trouble walking - well cabs are always available (and cheap by Boston standards) or you may want to choose someplace closer to your destination. If you're going to the Met, Guggenheim etc, this is fine.Parking was no trouble and cheap for NYC, the hotel gives you a validation and if you leave your car there it's $20/day.The hotel is not in the heart of the Upper East Side, it is in fact in Yorkville/Carnegie Hill. There is public housing right across the street but that doesn't bother us since that's exactly the same as where we live in Boston. Rampant crime in public housing is a myth. In seven years in this location in Boston, we have never experienced streetcrime living near public housing. Similarly we had no trouble in NYC. If myths about public housing scare you, then by all means pay double for the Midtown asphalt, noise and pollution. Otherwise, like us you may enjoy strolling through the leafy streets in the nicest part of NYC, the Upper East Side."
59,1785,"Jul 18 2007 	Only good if you get a good deal	My friend and I went on a girls' shopping/sightseeing trip to NYC over Memorial Day weekend. We found this hotel for $169/night, as it was newer and the rates were still low. The hotel is quite a hike away from the subway, which is essential to take to get into midtown. The location was our only real problem. The room was nice, good bedding, clean, and enough drawers/closet space for a short stay for 2 women. There was free internet in the lobby, which worked out great for printing off our boarding passes for our return flights. There are some tasty restaurants walking into the blocks southwest of the hotel. We felt safe in the hotel, but it was somewhat creepy walking back to hotel at night down 92nd St. I would recommend this hotel only if you can get a great rate because you do enough walking in NYC that it is worth staying at a hotel with easy subway access."
60,1785,"Jul 17 2007 	Get your walking shoes on...	I stayed at the Courtyard Marriot Upper East Side over Memorial Day weekend. Overall, the stay was pleasant, the only downfall would be the amount of time we spent walking!! The nearest subway stop (6- Lexington) is about a 15 minute walk or so. The neighborhood was great, and there were some great food options close to the hotel. Rooms were small, but clean. We were really only at the hotel to sleep anyways! I don't think that we'd stay here again due to the location and the walking..."
61,1785,"Jul 6 2007	Good Experience	We stayed at the Courtyard for a week. The staff was excellent, everyone from the front desk staff to the housekeepers to the life guards. Everyone was very professional and polite. The accomodations were excellent, although there was no room service. However, there was a pool, which was nice for the kids. The only downfall is that it is far away from the nearest subway, but there is a bus stop just outside the front door. I'm not too sure what the person was describing above about not feeling safe, we never had that concern in the week that we were there."
62,1785,"Jun 24 2007	OK but one night was enough!	There are experiences in life that you embrace and go with the flow and then there are experiences like the one at this hotel that make you close the door, make sure its locked and don't come out until morning.Didn't feel safe in the neighbourhoodNo room serviceOut of the wayRooms are smallClean Good front desk staffStayed 1 night and made a quick getaway to the Marquis first thing in the AM!"
63,1785,"May 30 2007 	It's ok but there are better hotels in NYC.	When checking in, the front desk announced loudly (literally the whole lobby could hear him), &quot;So you got the room from Priceline, right?&quot; I received a room with a tv located on the side wall next to a tall closet. You can pull &amp; turn the tray; the tv will turn 30 degrees but the right side of the screen was blocked by the closet resulting in limited viewing. Anyway, I went back down asking for another room only to be told, &quot;All rooms have the same configuration.&quot; Also, I asked for help to locate a &quot;coal-fired pizza&quot; restaurant. The front desk said &quot;Huh?&quot; then gave me a take-out menu from a regular pizza place instead."
64,1785,"May 16 2007 	Great Experience	Stayed here 5/11/07 thru 5/14/07. Did not see or hear any construction. Rooms were clean and nicely appointed. Unusually large and clean pool/workout/steam/sauna/locker rooms. Leave your laptop home, &quot;business center&quot; in lobby has computer setups with free internet service, printers, pens, paper, envelopes, etc. Staff friendly and helpful. We requested a fridge upon arrival and received a complimentary one promptly. Never a wait for a taxi. Residential area, but within walking distance of dozens of good, little restaurants, many with outdoor seating available. A little out of the way of most tourist attractions, but we were there to visit family on the upper east side. A great value for NYC; would definitely stay there again."
65,1785,"Apr 30 2007 	Clean new hotel with several shortcomings	Stayed here for two nights over a weekend at a very expensive corporate rate of $299 + tax. Had a queen+queen room on the 8th floor. No problem with noise from construction, which could have been since it was the weekend.Pros include clean, fresh design (not as flowery as many other Courtyard or Marriotts), high-speed internet, and good bathroom products. What let's this hotel down is its fairly inaccessible location, no minibar/fridge in room, no room service.Overall, I would probably not stay in this hotel again, not because the experience was poor, but because of the location."
66,1785,"Apr 24 2007 	Good hotel out of center	I had a very good stay at this hotel, but, I want to thank the reviewer who pointed out the construction on the lower floors of the building. This hotel occupies the ground floor, lower level, and floors 5 to 16. It is obvious from looking in the windows at floors 3 and 4 that there is internal construction. Those floors are not part of the hotel. I'm not sure that there was any work going on during the days I was there, but there is a construction permit. The room clerk tried to assign me to floor 5 even though I had requested an upper floor--a choice one is always given on the Marriott website. Because of the earlier review, I insisted on a higher floor away from the elevator, and was given a nice and quiet room that I enjoyed. The room was very well maintained. A little small as compared to other Courtyard hotels, but as large as I would expect in NYC. Free computer in lobby. I didn't try restaurant or bar. There are many small and interesting restaurants, especially on 2nd Ave. Some rooms have view of East River and bridge lit at night. Near Carl Schurz park for walk or jog along East River. This hotel is convenient to Metro Museum of Art, Guggenheim, Cooper-Hewitt and Central park by foot or bus. It's long walk or short bus ride to subway. I've stayed in mid-town many times and enjoyed staying in this residential neighborhood. You must be prepared to take a cab or bus or do a lot of walking."
67,1785,"Apr 22 2007	Good value for money in residential area	At about $200 per night, plus tax, this represents very good value for money. We found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The hotel has a very good fitness room, steam room, sauna, pool and jacuzzi. Definitely a plus for the hotel and way above average. There was a mixture of business travelers and families with kids at the hotel.You can walk to Central Park in 10 /15 minutes. Jogging there is perfect.Transport to mid-town and downtown is very easy. Buses are right round the corner on 1st Ave and are frequent. The subway is a ten minute walk away with fast connections to downtown.Eating / drinking - the area is full of bars and restaurants. We ate at an Italian and Turkish on Lexington Ave near the subway, both good.One con - the room was small. However, we only used the room to sleep in as we were out all day.Recommended."
68,1785,"Apr 5 2007 	Unethical Management - they don't tell you about the construction!	I booked a one week stay at the Coutyard for what I thought was going to be really good value for NYC. I did not count on being woken up at 6:30 am on Saturday morning, 7:30 am Sunday morning and 7 am on Monday and Tuesday to a cacophony of drilling, hammering and pounding. I moved three times but no matter which floor or room I was in - I heard the construction. Unbelievable! Apparently the hotel does not own floors 2, 3, 4 and above 16, so they cannot control what goes on on these floors. I lived in NYC for 8 years and I know for a fact that it is illegal to start construction before 9 am during the week and not at all on the weekends. While construction happens even at the best hotel, it is not before 9 am and you are warned and given a discount. What I find intolerable at this hotel, is that you are not warmed - you are DUPED! The hotel DOES NOT tell you that you definitely WILL hear these noises throughout the hotel when you check in - no matter which floor or room you are in! I find this completely unethical. When I pointed my issue out to the receptionist, she said &quot;I don't want to say that you checked in late, but we try to put guests in rooms above the 5th floor.&quot; I don't consider checking in at 2 pm late. The major construction is on the 4th floor. So do not allow yourself to be placed on the 5th floor by any means. Since the construction (in late March) is close to the elevator shaft, you can hear it on all floors - from 5 all the way to 14!If you are considering staying here - do so in a few months when (hopefully) the construction is finished. Otherwise you are in for a terrible experience."
69,1785,"Mar 31 2007 	Good Hotel in Manhattan	What a nice place to stay. I just returned from a week stay with my wife and our two teenage kids. The rooms with two beds are queen size and that helps when you have four people in a roomThe staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help. I travel a great deal for business and this place is way above average. I will back in NYC in a few months and plan to stay there again.At first, we did not care for the location and at the end were very happy where we where staying. It is very quiet (for New York). You are close to Gracie Mansion that is within a park on the Harlem River. You are also less than a mile from Central Park.The security is very good. A hotel staff member is staff at the front door at all times. You also must have a room key to ride the elevators. An added benefit is members of the NYC police department like to stop at the hotel for coffee and restroom breaks. We took public transportation because cab fares in NYC have really gone up. If you don't want to walk to the subway station, grab the M86 bus at 92nd and York. It is a half a block from the Courtyard. It goes directly to the 4,5,6 lines at 86th and Lexington. Or, you can take it across town to get to the Upper West Side. At the subway station, purchase a Metro Card. This will help you avoid having to carry $2 in change each time you ride a bus or take the subway. The M86 also stops around the corner of the hotel on your return trip. (BTW  the bus drivers are very helpful in explaining how to get around and use transfers.)So . . . it turned out to be a great location, easy to get around, and a great hotel."
70,1785,"Mar 15 2007	Good new Big Apple hotel	I found myself stranded in NYC late the other night and after calling or walking into five well known midtown hotels only to find them full or insisting on full rack rates well after midnight, I took a gamble and told a cab to take me up to 94th and First Avenue to the new Courtyard by Marriott, as friends who had stayed there said they liked it. I hoped because it was still so new that it might have a room. Luckily for me it did.It was wonderfully clean and fresh with large, blessedly smokefree rooms. The last NYC hotel I stayed in (a well known five star) must have had a cigar makers convention staying there. The smell was actually so strong the management had to place two whirring air purifiers in the hall. My Marriott/Upper East Side room was spacious with two big comfortable king sized beds and an attractive modern decor. A continental breakfast was included and the front desk staff was eager to be helpful. I saw that there was a health club, a pool and a whirlpool to sooth tired bodies. Very nice, especially for NYC.The newly completed, state of the art ASPCA is next door and worth a visit or at least a peek into its cattery windows from the sidewalk. It's not like an animal shelter anywhere else. It's more like an upscale pet shop. Maybe taking home one of its residents might be the most heart warming way to remember a great visit to Manahttan."
71,1785,"Mar 7 2007	New great stay good value for Manhattan	We just finished a 3 day stay at this hotel, located at the North-East corner of what can be called the Upper-East Side of Manhattan. Access is very convenient by car (2 blocks of FDR), and hotel parking is only $20/day (just down the block). Subway is quite a few blocks away (you have to walk down 4 blocks and across 3 avenues ... 15 minutes by foot). Taxi rides to midtown and Times Square ran around $9 to $10, but for a family of 4 this was money well spent. The area is a very quiet part of Manhattan, with Starbucks and convenience stores within 2 blocks. Good restaurants were about 3-5 blocks away and good shopping starts about 20 streets south (and 2 avenues over). The only downside to the location, besides distance from a subway stop, was an amazingly high levels of dog feces on the sidewalks. To be fair, I'm including what's left after the owner scoops up the bulk of the droppings. Maybe it has to do with the fact that the ASPCA office is just down the block ... you'll need sharp peripheral vision if you want to keep your shoes clean.The hotel is new ... so the room furnishings and condition were truly excellent for a sub $200 hotel in Manhattan. The beds were of good quality (not a $2000 pillow-top mattress, but new, firm, comfortable). The down comforters were a bit on the thin side, but the room was plenty warm even without the HVAC on. Towels were typical Courtyard. Furnishings in the room were also typical Courtyard, but new. HVAC unit was pretty noisy so we left it off. We opened the window for cool-fresh air. Basic bath amenities were avaiable, but they weren't the high-end designer brands I get when I stay at the Le Meridian in Midtown.Breakfast: very skimpy and almost not worth it. Small selection of mini-pastries, satisfactory coffee, assorted fresh fruit. No milk/juice/meats/cereals or hot items. Held in a lower level conference room. Great breakfasts available at Sarabeth's, which is a 12 minute walk (91st and Madison). Dinner there was also very good, and not too expensive ($75 for two with a glass of wine. But, be warned that the children we saw at Sarabeth's (for dinner) had perfect Upper-East side manners. Don't take your kids if they're having a high energy day because it'll spoil the atmosphere of this small restaurant.NOT a luxury hotel by any stretch of the imagination. But, as a generic business or family hotel ... it's very good for Manhattan. You'll feel like you got everything you paid for, and maybe a little bit more because the condition of the hotel is really ... well it's new.I've said in many midtown hotels that are notably more luxurious, and that have a really nice breakfast spread. But they also typically costs me $350-$600 a night. For the $170+ savings I put in my pocket every day, I'll just have breakfast at Sarabeths and put up with bed linens that are not quite as nice as what I have at home."
72,1785,"Feb 27 2007 	Great Hotel	The previous negative reviews are perplexing. Our room with one king bed was very pretty and immaculate. The bathroom was very attractive and of normal size.....extremely pretty shower. The bathroom door was no problem. Did not understand the previous comment about the door. We had lots of large thick towels and new shampoo was provided every day. Always plenty of very hot water. Sure the elevators are a little busy...never waited more than 3 minutes. Through many experiences in NY hotels, have found a little noise is to be expected. There was less than the usual noise at this hotel. The lighting in the room and bathroom was perfect. This is one of the nicer Courtyard hotels. The neighborhood is great with lots of delis, grocers, and restaurants - so much better than the touristy Times Square area."
73,1785,"Feb 27 2007 	I would not stay here again.	Both the hotel and the service were a disappointment. My room fan was stuck ON and the temperature never got below 85 degrees, leaving me wanting to open my window (which of course did not open) even in the coldest days of the year. When I asked for a cab the first day, I was told to walk down the street a few blocks and I could probably find one. When I asked if there were shuttles to the airport, I was told NO, although there were several available. I could go on with more examples of why I would not stay here again, but I am sure you have the idea already."
74,1785,"Feb 16 2007	not good!	Rooms so small. Bath room so small the door bangs on the shower rail! No bath room shampoos etc. You can hear every one in their rooms! Midnight is not the time to be hearing others either with their TV on or in their bathrooms. Air con is Very loud has to be off to sleep. As the last review says take your ear plugs. The lifts there are two of them are so slow! Pool ok but cold, sauna did not work. Breakfast room dirty. Towles in the room are no way the right size to dry with and feel like cardboard.All in all there are better places to stay in New York City."
75,1785,"Feb 14 2007 	Take Ear Plugs	We were booked for 3 nights after flying in from London. Check in was quick and painless. The staff here are the best part of the hotel. There were no bell hops when we arrived but they were around at other times. The access the floors with the rooms on them you have to use your room card. As for the room. We were 3. To adults and a 14 year old. One large bed and the sofa bed. This is were the problems start. The rooms are not anyway big enough to take this. There is a very large foot stool which when the sofa bed is pulled out causes a major fire exit hazard. How the city has allowed this, or their insurance company, who knows, its totally unsafe! Storage space is sparse. Bath room small, bath tub is a joke, shower ok but very lacking in hot water! TAKE EAR PLUGS If you do not mind hearing what every one else is doing around your room you will not need them. If you are ok hearing others use the bath room its fine staying here. If you do not mind being kept awake, fine. There is not a great deal of road noise and we were on the 5th floor. We told this to the front desk after the first night the answer is rock walling is now a common way of building and they were aware of the problem! The zircon system/ heater in the wall is very very loud, you will need to turn this off at night. We had to go out and buy our own shampoo after we asked for the pre used bottle to be replaced, which is wasnt. Hotel did pay us back. The sofa bed, had to twice ask for this to be made up. At just before midnight had to make a 3rd call for them to deliver a quilt as they only left us a sheet to cover our child. The lifts are real slow..Pool. Very cold. Steam room and sauna. Had to have the staff get these to work, they got the steam room working after a time but the sauna never worked. The ladies could not get theirs to work at all! Towel rack in the mens empty even told the pool staff. Breakfast room. Just look at the photos to give you some idea. Floor was filthy dirty with food!We checked out of this place after the first night. Says it all."
76,1785,"Feb 14 2007 	Perfect stay in Manhattan	Searching online, you'll find that the prices for hotels in New York are more than you can afford or extremely affordable, thus somewhat suspect. Reading all the great reviews for this hotel on tripadvisor, and seeing the unreal price for a nice hotel in Manhattan, my mother and I jumped at the option.We took a taxi from LaGuardia to the hotel for just around $25 (US). (Subsequently, if you are good with time and planning, you could also take a subway and then a bus to the airport. But the cab ride was short, relatively cheap, and convenient for us.)We arrived at the hotel around 11am knowing that check-in was not until 3pm, but hoping they could at least store our bags until then. It was a happy little surprise that our room happened to be vacant and they checked us right in, no hassles, no problems, all smiles. The rooms are on the small side, but ours was perfect: Two Very Comfortable beds, clean bathroom, and a comfy chair by the big window.As the last reviewer stated, there were problems off and on with the elevators, but we are patient women and never had to wait very long at all.There is a gym with quite a lot of exercise equipment and a beautiful pool on the lower floor.Coffee, juice, cereal, fruit, and pastries were available every morning from 6am - 9am. Our flight left LaGuardia at 6pm. The front desk was gladly able to hold our bags after check out while we spent our last afternoon roaming the city.The hotel is on 92nd, the closest subway station in just a few blocks over on 96th. Everything about our stay was perfect. We would definitely stay here again."
77,1785,"Feb 6 2007 	""Mostly good experience""	Just stayed at the Courtyard Upper East Side for two weekend nights. Got an excellent AAA rate through the hotel directly ($170 plus taxes). Agreed with other reviewers that the hotel is very clean and new with nice amenities. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Rooms quiet and bed very comfortable. My only complaint about this hotel sounds trivial but was a major inconvenience to our family. This refers to the elevators at the hotel, of which there were only two, and both were small and very slow. Around check out time, I waited 10 or 15 minutes just to get upstairs to my room while my husband had the car waiting outside. Since it took me two trips to get all our luggage, the check out process took over 30 minutes. People were getting extremely frustrated with the delays. I'm not sure that this hotel can do anything about their elevators, but guests beware: allow LOTS of time to get to and from your room!"
78,1785,"Jan 24 2007 	Truly Great Value in New York City	Thank you, Bill Marriott! Located on the Upper Eastside of New York, this Marriott is a jewel. The staff is friendly, the rooms clean, the beds very comfortable and the security is tight and both seen and effective. We stayed with our children for two nights and although somewhat out of the way, because of the location to the FDR drive, we were able to get to downtown and midtown in a breeze. If you're looking for a midtown, expensive and snooty typical New York City hotel, this is not it. If you like friendly, professional staff, a comfortable and relaxing room and bed, and a free cup of coffee, croissant and fruit in the morning; coupled with a nice pool and gym, at all a very fair price, stay here. Funny thing...because of this hotel alone, we're thinking of coming back to New York City more often."
79,1785,"Dec 31 2006 	Best choice staying NYC	We stayed at this new location during our recent visit. We had a king-suite with a kitchen in the living area. The rooms are very new, clean and well-equiped. Lower level has a full swimming pool, jacuzzi; steam, sauna rooms, exercise equipment and also a guest laundary room.The morning continental breakfast was very decent. Professional staff services and keyed security elevator (especially at NYC) are of highest quality. Transportation is convenient. Whole family had a great time and we'll definitely come back again!"

1,1789,Crowne Plaza Times Square	Amazing hotel. Very posh and pricey but in a wonderful place with brilliant views of times square.
2,1789,"A Great short break	This hotel is in a ideal position to visit all of the major shopping centres, and the view you get as soon as you go out of the reception doors is of Times Square.We arrived on a Thursday at 5.45PM and had no trouble booking in and there was no queues, I had booked this break using my points and was upgraded onto a conceige room, a corner room which had a view of central park in the distance and of Times square it also included free breakfast which saved me both time and money and the use of the conceige lounge in the day.The bed was extremely comfortable and the surroundings pleasant. Staff were very efficient and I had parcels delivered to the hotel for when I arrived which they kept safe.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and when I visit again then the Crowne Plaza would be my hotel of choice."
3,1789,"Great place	Nothing to complain about. Great location, friendly staff. Nice clean modern room. Fantastic"
4,1789,"Fabulous staff  great hotel and location	This trip was a surprise for my husbands birthday, We came in a mixed group I set of couples, two families with children.We arrived on a soggy Saturday at half term, to be greeted with a large check in queue, this diminshed swiftly with the efficient and friendly staff .Although the room wasn't ready it didn't deter us from experiencing the action our 1st ever visit to NY. We went for a walk and arrived back at 3.00pm The queue for check in was horrific as everybody wanted to collect thier keys etc. Again the queue dissapated, but whilst we were waiting I spoke to a lady named Vicky about my husbands priority points, which I had not been able to use as it was a surprise, as soon as she saw my name she recognised my from a call I had made 2 months earlier !!!! How is that for great service skills, I was very impressed even more so, when she remembered it was his bday treat, then the best thing ever happened she upgraded us to a King size room overlooking Times square.WOWThe hotel was very very comfortable and poeple have already expressed their views on the internet charges, drinks and food, which I do agree with, but when you are in NY.. visit the deli etc or just splash out.All the staff were always courteuous, helpfull and excelled in all areas, we had a few request in the room extra pillows etc, all were met with our expectations.I had a problem when i returned home my card had been used twice for my bill, they were very apoligetic and swiftly refunded it, these things can happen everybody is human.To finalise We all loved the location and the hotel is was simply brilliant , thank you to Leo who was always smiling and nothing was too much trouble, Teresa for sorting out my payment and Vicky THANK YOU.. you are an asset to the crowne plaza."
5,1789,"Nov 25 2009 	Amazing location!	I have just returned from a short, whistlestop tour of NMYC, staying at the Crowne Plaza.The location of the hotel could not have been better right in the bustling heart of midtown Manhatton. Every amenity required is right on the door step, and a lovely door step it is too.When we arrived, having booked a large room for 4 people, we were told that they did not have any such rooms left. We could not understand this since we had booked the trip some months ago, but after some jiggling around the problem was resolved and we were sent off up to the room. Not a good start, and not one that I expected from such an establishment.The room was lovely and spacious, with modern, fresh furnishings. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and the linens and pillows etc heavenly! I ahd heard that the rooms can be quite noisy, but I did not find this at all and we were not disturbed at any point. The downside is that we did not find the room itself terribly well appointed for more than two people. There were 4 of us sharing and every day we had to ask for more towels, the wardrobe space was minimal and had only a few hangers. The view also was disappointing since we were facing brick walls, but to be fair we were barely in the room so that didn't matter a bit. The hotel facilities were very nice. The reception area, bar and restaurant are very chic, and the lifts are plentiful and efficient. We did not make it as far as the gym, pool etc, but I am sure they too would have been very nice! The check out procedure was smooth, friendly and efficient.All in all I think this is a top rate hotel, so long as there are no more than two of you sharing a room!"
6,1789,"Nov 23 2009 	Great Hotel in an Unbeatable Location	First off, the location could not be any better for Times Square. Right in the middle.About the hotel, it is newly redone and is very nice. We were on the 33rd floor overlooking Times Square with the room being clean and modern.The only complaint is internet is 19.50 per 24 hrs.Parking not run by the hotel but in the hotel cost 88 dollars for two days for a minivan but it is NYC.The staff were all out of their way friendly.For seeing New York, you can't get any better for the location."
7,1789,"Nov 18 2009 	What a location!	We stayed her for 4 nights at the end of October, It was a busy time and everything worked. Staff were helpful and friendly - especially the barmen!We stayed on the 46th floor - concierge level - if you can - do it!The location is spot on, you are close to everything on the main stream entertainment front of NYC."
8,1789,"Nov 17 2009 	Great hotel in an unbeatable location	I stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend (now fianc!) as a surprise trip to New York for her 30th birthday (and to propose). After much deliberation and internet research I am pleased to say that I made the right choice by staying at The Crowne Plaza Times Square.I was initially a little put off by the hotel's low trip advisor ranking and previous bad reviews however I noticed the reviews improving after the recent multi million dollar refurbishment. It is very rare for me to say this but I have not got one major complaint about this hotel, in fact the only thing that went wrong was that our room wasn't ready when we arrived (3hr wait!) but this was more than compensated by $100 of vouchers to spend at the nice hotel bar!! (broadway baby is a nice cocktail there). I also requested non-feather pillows when making the booking but these were not present in the room, to the hotels credit a member of staff brought replacement pillows within 5 minutes of me making them aware of the problem.The hotel feels very clean and modern, the lobby is impressive and the staff attentive. It is a very busy hotel with a mixture of business people, couples and families. There was always a large number of staff present and our luggage was safely looked after when we checked out. The location is one of this hotels main assets, it is right slap bang in the middle of all the action making it is very easy to get to and from.The room was of an adequate size, much the same size as any major city. Nice big windows and the decoration was clean and tasteful (there was a few marks and scuffs here and there). The bathroom was an adequate size and very clean, the shower was reasonably powerful but certainly not a power shower. The bath was very shallow which meant romantic baths were a no no. The cleaning/maid staff were very professional and seemingly trustworthy. The TV had some problems with the HD channels but I wasn't overly concerned about that. The safe was excellent and came in very handy. I was suprised there was no mini bar or fridge but there was a coffee/tv maker.We had a room on the 38th floor, the views were pretty good but the window didn't really open properly which meant the room got a little stuffy during the night. I would advise asking for a room away from the elevators as these areas can get a little noisy. I nearly upgraded to the concierge floor but the budget wouldn't quite allow this, I didn't hear anyone raving about the service on these floors so I'm guessing it was a wise choice not to upgrade (I did try and get a free upgrade due to the 3hr check in).The main thing that will stick in our memory about this hotel is how comfy the beds are!! They are simply amazing!! We had our best nights sleep ever in this bed and it really was a shame to leave it behind.I would certainly recommend this hotel to any of my friends and would stay there again.I hope you found my review useful.My words of advice for New York:1) Plan ahead - There is so much choice you simply must decide where you're visiting and where you're eating each day2) Get a limo from the airport, travel in a bit more style and you might get lucky like us and get a real New Yorker as a driver who gives you his own guided tour. Only $60 compared to an aggressive yellow cab for $50!!3) See Mamma Mia - The first show I've ever been to, simply brilliant production4) Eat at 21 Club (upstairs, brilliant waiter) and Gordon Ramsay @ The London5) Be prepared for very high prices for beer and wine (and we didn't think the shopping was all that good unless you've got thousands to spend on 5th avenue6) Do not, under any circumstances, dine at Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse! Absolutely hideous establishment!"
9,1789,"Nov 17 2009 	This really is all about location	The title says it all - what a great place to stay if you want to be near the centre of things.We were on the first BA flight of the day from Heathrow so checked in early - about 1pm with no delay at all. Great service from receptionist and we were given access to Concierge Lounge on 46th floor for comp. breakfast as I am a Priority Club Platinum member - very welcome.Room on 35th floor with a limited view of Times Square but great city-scape right out to the Hudson river. Bed probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in (which says a lot as I use hotels 2/3 nights per week). Very good sized room for NYC with all usual facilities.Drinks may seem a little expensive but it is a Crowne Plaza right on Times Square - plently of choice around if you want something more reasonable. I can't comment on food, other than breakfast which was great, as we ate elsewhere but the menu looked ok.Would I stay there again - without a doubt.My top tips for your trip - great lunchtime sandwiches at Emmet O' Lunneys Irish Pub and Restaurant on West 51st - two mins away from hotel or at The Playwright (Celtic Pub) Bar and Restaurant on West 50th - only one min away. Sightseeing trip with Citysights NY very good - book the 2 day 'All Loops' trip to get the chance to see Upper Manhattan and Brooklyn as well as the usual downtown sights and they will also give you some discount vouchers and tickets for museums and a harbour cruise.Have a great time."
10,1789,"Nov 16 2009 	Great hotel great locationgreat staff	I booked Crowne Plaza Times Square for a 3 night stay for my friend and I for a shopping trip. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There wsa no problem checking in early and the room was on floor 22 and there was NO noise from Broadway. The beds were SO comfy and the safe was excellent in the room operated by your credit card with no charge. The room was cleaned each day, sheets / towels were changed once. The location was ideal - on broadway as we went to 2 shows, Mamma Mia and Chicago.Access to the internet was free for 10 mins per day, it was $1 / min after that. I could not close out of google prior to the 10mins but I contacted Leo (Manager) and he was so helful and assissted me in removing the extra $10 charge. Also, they allowed us to check out late (2pm) as our flight was later on in the day. The hotel has a comfy, homely feel and I would not hesitate in staying there again or recommending the hotel to others. We ate lunch there and express breakfast one morning. It was expensive but so is everywhere on Times Square."
11,1789,"Nov 13 2009 	I wish I didn't have to leave!	We stayed on the 37th floor with a view of the Hudson River. The tall buildings round about took our breaths away at first as we'd never seen anything like it, but we soon got used to looking up at everything in the city and now i'm home I really miss it. The room was lovely, we had the most comfortable twin beds i've ever experienced. After a long day walking round the city it was a joy to lay there watching the local news stations on the rather large LCD Televison. We didn't book breakfast in our deal, instead we just went to one of the many local Deli's and bought in fruit and yogurts, etc and ate before we left in the morning. All the hotel staff we met were really friendly and accommodating; we used the Concierge a few times to help us - including tickets for a show (we were only there a few days so didn't want to queue at TKTS for hours). We also used the Left Luggage facility in the basement to leave our bags on the last day - only a tip required for this service. We found the location of the hotel to be perfect to get everywhere - Theatres are all a short walk; Bus tours all leave within a couple of blocks; 5th Avenue is about 10 minutes max; Central Park about 15 minutes; Macy's and The Empire State Building about 20 minutes. I would recommend the tour buses - one of which is 'hop on hop off' very handy for shopping - Die hard shoppers DON'T MISS Century 21 beside Ground Zero for the best bargains, and ask in Macy's about the store's visitors discount card. We also went on the the Party Shuttle Tour which was very informative and took us to Staten Island and back. I would love to visit New York again and would definitely make the Crowne Plaza my first choice."
12,1789,"Nov 10 2009 	Great location very nice experience	This was my first time here, we usually stay at the Westin Times Square, but wanted to try a new place with a friend who had never been to NY. The location was perfect for what we wanted to do (shopping, Today Show, Broadway Show, etc.) Breakfast was a great addition - lines were long but moved fairly quickly. Rooms were room, bathroom had a single large sink and lots of countertop space - great showerhead too. I would definitely stay there again."
13,1789,"Nov 8 2009 	Fabulous central location but would have been out of price range if we didn't have loyalty points	I'd only recommend this to a very rich friend or someone who saves loyalty points for the Crowne Plaza / Holiday Inn. I visited New York with a female friend for a shopping weekend in New York.Service was quite interesting - not sure we looked like the usual guests there so the receptionist's service was a little bizarre at first. The receptionist's attitude changed for the better once she realised we were there on loyalty points and that we were English. We had a beautiful twin room (with two double beds) which I think was on the 20th floor overlooking Times Square. The lifts were very fast and almost dizzying. We couldn't believe you had to pay for WiFi here as this is not usualy in other hotels we've both stayed in the USA. We sampled the cocktails in the evening in the bar and we soon decided to moved on as the cocktails were not that great. It was a good though as it made us sample the delights NY had to offer outside the hotel. We know the hotel had sports facilities, swimming pool, restaurants etc but didn't have time to try them out as shopping was our main aim."
14,1789,"Nov 7 2009 	Loved this hotel!!	My two sisters and I and our husbands stayed at this hotel for 2 nights (Oct 11 - 13/09) pre-cruise. We arrived at the hotel at 7 PM and there was only one person at the line-up before us. The check-in staff was very courteous and fast. We asked for higher floor rooms and we got 3 rooms on the 30th floor which were all spacious, have divan sofa and flatscreen TVs. My room was closest to the elevator but I didn't hear any noise. It was also a corner room with 2 windows: one window was facing Times Square. The lights outside didn't bother us because the window coverings were adequate. Our king size bed was so comfortable, I wish I could take it home with me. Our room key provided access to the business centre &amp; we were allowed 10 mins of free internet use per day. To access the internet, you need to swipe your credit card, which would NOT be charged for the 1st 10 mins of use. Please make sure that you log out properly and get a print-out of your usage, otherwise the minutes would keep ticking away and you may end up with a big charge on your credit card. When I logged out, the print-out showed that I owed over $150. I immediately complained to the front desk and was provided with a tel # to call and the customer service staff agreed to reverse the charges. It turned out that the print-out was for the guest who used the internet before me so I did her a good favor, complaining on her behalf. I was told that the hotel was fully booked during our stay yet I didn't find anything lacking in their service. There were 2 staff working at the concierge desk so I didn't have to wait for more than 2 minutes to speak with one of them to ask for maps, directions and their restaurant recommendations and to have them call our car service for pick-up when we were ready to leave the hotel. We checked out early and used their left-luggage facilities on the ground floor. We had buffet breakfast at the restaurant and the food selection and service was awesome. It was really nice to start our day with a good breakfast. We all bought 2-day NY passes and we walked to most of the attractions except when we needed to go to the financial district for our walking tour and to take the ferry to visit the Statue of Liberty. We also joined the midtown &quot;Food on Foot&quot; tour and it turned out that 9th Ave (between 43rd and 53rd) had the cheapest and yummiest eateries.We had such a great time in NYC and the major reason was because we enjoyed our stay at the Crowne Plaza Times Square. We will definitely return to this hotel again in our next visit."
15,1789,"Nov 6 2009 	TERRIBLE STAFF AND SERVICE!!!	This hotel is fully dependant on location. The rudest staff I've ever had the pleasure of being served by. I've had to wait an hour for a bottle of water that I called up for three times now!!Charges to our credit card for services were complimentary, which was also not very nice!I would recommend for location, but that is all."
16,1789,Nov 4 2009 	Awesome city.	Hotel was nice. Good service. Bartender helped with nearest non stop alcohol Bar:D Hotel room with great view to Hudson river - I hope. Nice Lobby Bar...Good - Clean and Nice.
17,1789,"Nov 2 2009 	Messed Up - though ideal location	We arrived at the hotel at approx 21:00 on a Saturday night - it was very busy with lots of families checking in, especially from the UK as it was the first weekend of the school holidays.We were immediately told that the room we had requested (and pre-paid) was not available for this night - this was a high-level twin-double room but we would be moved the following day. We were given a standard double room on the 16th floor. One single rollaway was put in the room which was insufficient - we had two kids with us - so we requested another which was shoehorned into the room - no additional pillows were provided despite our requests. We were provided with complimentary breakfast coupons by way of apology,On the following day, we were initially told we were to be moved to another room on the 16th floor - which again did not match what we had reserved. On protesting we were moved to the 41st floor. The room was fine with views over to the Hudson River. However, our luggage, which were told was being delivered to our new room then went missing. It took 4 phone calls to locate the luggage - in total over an hours delay.The hotel location is good - right on Times Square (if you like that kind of thing) - with a good restaurant and a very buzzy bar. However, it seems that it just cant handle the volume of guests and that complete lack of organisation really lets it down. Also...$32 per person for a buffet breakfast!!!!!One note; on check out we (after some negotiation) were given an $83 credit on my credit card for the room downgrade on the first night."
18,1789,Nov 1 2009 	Something's not right there	I checked out of my room and 5 minutes later realized that I had left my cellphone on the night table. When I called I was put in touch with a nasty women who worked in security. I asked them to check the room . When I called back they told me that my phone was nowhere to be found. It is now one week and several phone calls later and have not had any luck recovering my phone. Something is fishy about that!!!
19,1789,"Oct 28 2009 	Outstanding...better than expected	Crowne Plaza Manhattan was absolutely the best choice we could have made. What an outstanding staff the people working there were the most gracious and most welcoming hotel staff we have ever encountered. From the time, we arrived with the Bellman, the Front desk staff and the Concierge team. The rooms were exceptionally beautiful with many extra comforts. I would recommend that if you want to see the city, you could not find a better place to stay. Each person made us feel that we were the most important guest in the hotel. They just could not do enough for us. It was a great experience and we would stay there repeatedly."
20,1789,"Oct 28 2009 	Great location great rooms	This was our 1st New York experience and we weren't dissapointed. The only negative would be the reception staff, maybe they were just busy. Also concierge area always had queues, couldn't even get a question in. Anyway would recommend."
21,1789,"Oct 24 2009 	are you SURE you need to stay on Times Square?	First let me say this hotel was perfectly acceptable for the price we paid.This hotel is an extremely big central hotel right on times square.When you plan a trip to NY you think you want to stay right on times square.It might not be such a great idea for everyone in fact. You would be much better off staying a few blocks off of times square in a quieter neighborhood.All the restaurants on Times Square are huge industrial factories where you have to wait for hours before getting a table. Much better to be in a less busy area and just around the corner from a great family run place.In any case you just take a taxi anywhere you want to go, staying right on Times Square is more of an inconvenience than a benefit.Staying in a nicer neighborhood and visiting Times Square by day would have been a much better choice for us.This hotel is a huge industrial hotel (for example, you must always wait in line to be able to speak to someone at the front desk no matter what time it is.. this annoys me already...)On the plus side, we staid in the executive floors and the rooms were well appointed (although wc stopped up and overflowed, maintenance brought a plunger within a reasonable delay).The executive floor lounge was really nice. You could have a lite breakfast or snack there, people could get out of the room and take their computers there or go watch TV. It was really nice to have this lounge.Note: they show a swimming pool in the photos; it is microscopic and filled with people who come every day to do laps (no room for hotel guests in the pool). Health club has OK equipment but is in a room with no windows.In-hotel dining is outrageously expensive. Go across the street (or rather take a taxi to another neighborhood you'll pay half the price for better service and food)."
22,1789,"Oct 24 2009 	I love New York	Had a great time shopping, hotel was beautiful, service was great!!"
23,1789,"Oct 24 2009 	Great Location - Poor Hotel 	We stayed at this establishment in September, we are not new to the Crowne Plaza brand and have stayed worldwide in their hotels and are platinum priority members. Unfortuately this one just doesn't meet the standard of a Crowne Plaza and is similar to a budget hotel but charging top dollar.The plus point is the location it is perfect, right bang in the middle of Times Square and should have everything going for it - the sad part is the hotel, management and staff let it down big style. The staff are very rude and have a couldn't careless attitude when dealing customers. I must add that the staff who work for tips (bellman, waiter etc) are in the main perfect and nothing is a trouble to them. When approcahing the front desk you almost feel as though you are imposing on the social gathering of the staff as they are always in deep conversation and never try calling the front desk as they never answer or if they do just put you on hold.Our rooms were Conceirge Class and they were no different to a normal room elsewhere, so god knows what their standard rooms are like. We had multiple issues with the room on check in, the toilet was full to the top with water, yet there was no running water in the room. It was evident that the room had never been used for a long time and had a funny odor - we were not moved but the maintenace man was good and got things fixed eventually. The management will tell you that the hotel has had a multi million dollar renovation programme done recently but there is little evidence of this - the beds and bedding was very uncomfortable.We did use the restaurant and this was very over priced for the quality, yes you expect to pay more in a hotel, but the quality should not be compromised. The location is great and there are plenty of eating houses around to choose from.Would we return to this hotel, no chance - it's simply not up to scratch for the premium they charge. If you are planning a business trip then this is the hotel for you if you are a tourist don't bother go elsewhere would be my advice.On check out I let my concerns be know and was told this was helpful as they want to become once again one of the best hotels in Manhattan - I would say they have a lot work ahead of them and a long way to travel before this dream becomes a reality!!"
24,1789,"Oct 21 2009 	Crowne Plaza not worth the money	We booked two concierge floor rooms requesting months in advance that the rooms be together. We called the week of our stay to make sure they had our request to be together because we have four children. Not only were our rooms not together, they were on seperate floors. After much begging, they put us on the 42nd floor in a king handicap and a double. We had to fight to get our free internet and keys to the concierge room. And they still acted like they were doing us a favor. The staff was rude, and the hotel subpar"
25,1789,"Oct 21 2009 	**Stay here! Dont listen to the bad reviews!**	I am a very honest person and i can say stay at the Crown Plaza Hotel in times Square! I could not fault it one bit! We stayed here as we were getting married in NY and had a few family members staying with us. My family could not fault this hotel either. We stayed for 7 nights, we were on the 40th floor. No noise and we had a corner room facing Times Square. Clean rooms, clean sheets, clean bathroom. Lifts did not take that long to get you up and down. The staff at this hotel were excellent and gave great customer service. Food seemed alittle overpriced so didnt eat here but the hotel is fab and would stay again! Thank you Crowne Plaza for making our wedding so special!"
26,1789,"Oct 20 2009 	Perfect	Right location, right level of comfort, stunning view and access to a private lounge away from the hustle and bustle. All in all very good stay and the staff were excellent and informative."
27,1789,Oct 18 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised. Great Location and Hotel.	I stayed here 1 night over the Columbus Day weekend. I was surprised by the hotel and its overall appearance. It was very good looking with a nice lobby and spacious rooms. I used my priority rewards points and had a great room on the 41st floor. I walked in and couldn't believe how contemporary and nice the room was. The location is awesome. I walked everywhere. I really liked the late night activity down Broadway Street. I would definitely stay here again.
28,1789,"Oct 18 2009 	Our new favorite hotel in NYC!	Just returned from a 3 night stay...this place is awesome! We chose the Crowne Plaza for this trip mainly due to it's location. After a number of previous trips to NYC (w/ and w/ out kids in tow) we've just about covered all of the stereotypical sight-seeing stuff in the 'Big Apple.' This trip was about the theater, shopping, dining, cocktails, and basically just walking around and enjoying the city. For all that--and more--you SERIOUSLY cannot ask for a better location in a hotel. From what I understand the hotel has undergone renovations that five the hotel a very nice, contemporary look and feel. All of the staff we encountered during our stay (everyone from bell hops to the front desk to the bar) were really friendly and helpful if you needed something. Nobody working there acted rude or appeared to have an attitude whatsoever--it's almost as if they actually *get it* that without the hotel guests their jobs may not exist (maybe thethe management has something to do w/ it??). Our room was a good size--very clean plus a comfortable bed and nice flat screen HDTV. When we checked in (about an hour early) our room was ready and ended up having to switch rooms because we requested one away from the elevator, but somehow it ended up being right next to the elevator. No issues or attitude, though--they switched it immediately. The bell hop who brought our luggage up asked if we needed anything else--we said tweo more pillows and three were sent up almost immediately.A couple of misc. notes (some based on previous reviews): ~I believe the hotel was quite full during our stay, however the muliple (!!) times we walked by the front desk we only notice a small line a few times. ~As nice as this hotel is, it doesn' t have an &quot;uppity&quot;/&quot;snobbish&quot; feel to it. We felt the price was reasonable, too, considering the prime location.~This hotel truly is in the heart of all the action: the theater district; Times Square; shopping; resturants; the subway; and a few blocks from Rockerfeller Center/NBC and Radio City Music Hall. Also right next to the Hershey store and across from M&amp;M store. :)~One thing w/ Times Square is that yes, it can be crowded and there are people constantly trying to give you brochures or wanting you to go on tours or to shows, but all you have to do is politely ignore them if you aren't intersted."
29,1789,"Oct 15 2009	Perfect location perfect holiday!	My mum and I stay in lots of hotels and we stayed at this hotel and arrived home yesterday. This hotel has the perfect location, we walked to everywhere we needed to go. The sight seeing buses pick up from just outside so is great. All within walking distance.... 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Centre, Times Square, Magnolia Bakery (Check it out, esp if you are a SATC fan!), Central Park and loads and loads more, it's basically close to everywhere!The hotel is modern and clean and the staff are very helpful and friendly. I am already planning on going back to New York and I will definately stay at this hotel."
30,1789,"Oct 13 2009 	Great Hotel - Fab location cant ask for more	We stayed for 3 nights at The Crowne Plaza Times Square, then 1 night (our last night at The Barclay Hotel) The Barclay cost a lot more and we were staying there for a last night as a special treat, we wished we had stayed at the Crowne Plaza the whole time The Barclay was so expensive and tired in comparrison and miles away from anywhere, staff were rude, very dissapointing, we changed rooms it was no better, the bathrooms are old things in the room were broken such as the ironing board. Stop at The Crowne Plaza for a modern stay with friendly staff and great location. The Barclay Hotel isnt recomended unless you want a nice reception area as thats all thats nice about it."
31,1789,"Oct 12 2009 	Nice Surprise	I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel, and customer service. Also, the location was wonderful. Much better than I had expected for a New York City hotel."
32,1789,Oct 11 2009 	Great Hotel could not get a better position	We stayed here for honymoon its was great position nad would go back. Price wise we found teh New Yorker better Value for monay..
33,1789,Oct 11 2009 	Avoid it like the plague especially if you want a King non-smoking...	My partner travels to New York several times a month for business so when I can get away I go. When he told me that we were staying at the Crown Plaza in Time Square I was excited as we have never stayed at this hotel. We arrived around 7:00 PM and when we got there we were given our room keys and went upstairs. When we finally reached our room we discovered that we had two beds instead of our king. We specifically asked for a king non-smoking. So my partner called the front desk to see if we could change. We were told that they didn't have non-smoking king but could get us a smoking king. He was put on hold and eventually we hung up because of the wait. So we called back and we asked for the manager and he tried to get us a smoking king but he said Oh I am sorry but we no longer have any of those. I about fell over. He said that he could change our room the next day but we said forget it. We were beat so decided to order dinner in. The food took about an hour to get to us. We had steak and salad. It was pretty good but way too EXPENSIVE. My partner ordered a beer and it was $9.00. I thought that was ridiculous. My advice is to avoid eating there  go to Ruby Foo's.So the bed situation was bad. My partner and I couldn't fit comfortably on the full size bed. It felt like a twin bed and like we were on a naughty camping trip. The maid service was good. The maids were friendly and fast. The room was spacious and the in room entertainment was great. I wouldn't stay here again and I would advise anyone I liked to stay here.
34,1789,"Oct 11 2009 	Wow! What a great hotel/room!	From the bellmen, check-in staff, and room everything was just great. Our room overlooked Times Square on the 18th floor. Lovely room with all the best amenities. Every employee was friendly and spoke to you. I will definitely stay here again. Great location."
35,1789,Oct 10 2009 	THE perfect spot for a one night visit to NYC!	Absolutely perfect place to maximize our quick overnight to NYC! We parked our car on arrival and didn't see it again til we left! - and all right in Times Square!
36,1789,"Oct 10 2009 	Great Hotel	Stayed at this hotel for two nights before taking a cruise, great location, and great hotel.We asked for a high floor and were given the 43rd floor!!This hotel only has a door entrance on times square the main car entrance is from a side street, you go up a level (Hersheys shop in below the hotel) to a small hotel lobby, this was the only down side.The staff were very good the rooms were modern and very clean.The location is excellent.Stay here if you have an opportunity."
37,1789,Oct 9 2009 	Great location 	We really liked this hotel &amp; plan on staying there on our next visit to Manhattan. The breakfast buffet included in our rate was a full buffet with all the desired items. Service from concierge to wait staff to front desk/concierge was excellent. Rooms newly renovated with great beds and the corner king made for more room.
38,1789,"Oct 9 2009 	Exactly what was needed for a theatre weekend.	Very nice hotel. It was the best location to secure Broadway show tickets at the TKTS booth. Don't eat breakfast in the restaurant, it's too pricey. Head over a block and a half to the Hotel Edison. Great breakfast for only $7.95."
39,1789,"Oct 8 2009 	who could ask for anything more	I went with my sister in law to this hotel for a conference her work was having. I was there for pleasure. it was very clean and everyone was very friendly. we had a problem with the coffee maker (operater error) and the maintenance man came and showed us how to work it. The rooms were large enough for 3 people to share without bumping into each other. Our view was right over times square but we couldn't actually see the ball but all we had to do was step outside. great location, it was walking distance to most theaters as well as Rockefellar Center and Empire State Building. We are going back for the New Year."
40,1789,Oct 8 2009 	Birthday in New York	Great hotel in the center of all the action.Clean and quiet with great beds just what was needed after 2 weeks in europe on hard mattresses.
41,1789,"Oct 8 2009 	Can't beat the location	Our first time in NYC with the family and wanted to be in a good central manhattan location. You can't beat the crown plaza for exactly that. Great location and nice rooms - although a bit cramped for 4. Mainly the desk is too close to the bed so you can't sit at it and have anyone walk by. But that is the only complain. Very clean. Quick elevators even though it is 49 stories. I didn't use the restaurants in the hotel at all because there is too much to explore nearby - broadway shows, plenty of restaurants, etc. The subway is also close. They also had a helpful concierge although there was usually a line."
42,1789,"Oct 8 2009 	Crowne Plaza TS average hotel for price paid	Stayed recently with daughter and mother in a double room overlookng TS. Location was great. View was great. Hotel was very clean. Room size was about average. Bathroom was nice size but our water regulator was broke. We couldn't get hot water the first night we were there. Called front desk and they sent someone about half an hour later. He said it had to be set at a specific spot and had to run for about 10 minutes to get hot water. Daughter took a cold shower before this and mother had trouble with bath the next morning. Once we learned the trick, we all had hot water. But with the price of the hotel I don't think we should have had to learn a trick to get hot water. We were compensated for this though with a free breakfast the morning of check-out. We appreciated the gesture but the breakfast was just mediocre. The best item I had was the Rice Krispies with fresh blueberries and strawberries. If I would have had to pay the $26-32 that was listed as the rice for a breakfast buffett I would have ben upset but since it was free I didn't lose out on anything. The waiters don't do much serving. I think they only need to give you one cup of coffee and juice. They didn't come around to fill up cups after the initial serving. Parking is very expensive so we used an Icon parking garage about 3 blocks down 49th street and saved $90 for the 51 hour stay. At night security checked for room keys before entering the escaltor. Also it was very difficult to get the front desk at night, phone would just ring and ring."
43,1789,"Oct 5 2009 	Great Location	We just returned from Crowne Plaza and this was an excellent hotel. We went Sept. 30th - Oct. 4th, 2009. Staying here gives you the true feeling of Times Square. The bed was very comfortable, big room with king size bed (rm. 3502), wonderful staff, and great views. We left the curtains open for the bright lights, that's part of NY to me. The hotel is located right beside Hersey's Choc. and across the street from the M &amp; M for all those choc. lovers. The best part of the trip other thant he hotel was winning tickets for the Late Show with David Letterman and the taping we attended was him telling about the affair with co workers, we all thought it was a joke until it was on the Today Show. Awesome trip and great hotel. It was expensive but so is everything else in NY. Well worth the money if you are wanting to be in the action of Times Sqaure. They do charge extra if you use the gym and internet."
44,1789,"Oct 3 2009 	Made first NYC trip just perfect!	I can't recommend the Crowne Plaza TS highly enough! For us Brits it has to be a 4*star standard at least! Probably best of all is it's amazing Times Square/Broadway location, if you are lucky enough to get a higher floor room overlooking Times Sqre that will top it off. The staff are happy to accommodate requests or at least try their best we found, friendly and polite. Everything from arrival, the lobby up was impressive and efficient. We never ate or drink at the hotel so cant comment, just too many things outside and places to fit into a 4 day trip! Every floor has a great ice machine so was no problem having no fridge in room we found. Great tea/coffee machine tho that was so easy to use, makes a change! Room was really modern and obviously recently renovated just the right size, great bathroom, fab little safe, king bed was possibly the most comfy bed I've ever slept in!:) Being so central many of the top sights are within walking distance (don't forget your comfiest trainers for NYC!) Warning - Across the street from the M&amp;Ms store and next door to Reeces /Hersheys- will test your will power!! Will be back to NY next year fingers xxd and 100% will be staying at CPTS again, I dont think you could beat it! Made our first NYC trip really special!"
45,1789,"Sep 29 2009 	Awesome - if you have the means go	I was able to book 6 nights here on my Priority Club points. We got a corner room on the 35th floor overlooking the north and west of the city. I'm Platinum, so everything was comp'd (internet access at 19.95/day free, fitness room, 46th floor, etc). The room was great, with our only complaint that the shower had very low water pressure and almost no hot water. I did call about it but we were out and had the Do Not Disturb on when they came by. They left us a message but we failed to call back to have someone come back up. At checkout the manager implored me that we should have had it checked out to make our stay better. I assured him that if the only problem we had was only warm water and low water pressure, we could live with it. We never tried the hotel bar as it was always full in the evening (and it's not cheap). You're right in the middle of everything, 2 blocks from the N subway on 49th that brings you to 42nd and Times Square to get anywhere. Next time I go back to the city, this is where I'll be staying, until the points run out that is :)"
46,1789,"Sep 28 2009 	A Great Hotel	Just got back home today. My wife and I can't say enough about the Crowne,its in the middle of everything.Stayed on the 27 floor facing Times Square,the people in the hotel couldn't have been more helpful. The lights of Times square shine bright. Free internet would have made it perfect.Otherwise a VERY nice hotel with a lot of attention to detail."
47,1789,"Sep 27 2009 	Great Times Square Hotel	Booked the CP Times Square on hotwire - managed to get it for 200 a night for the room. we only stayed 2 nights (end of a NYC/LA celebration trip!) but wanted to stay really central and in a bit more luxury at the end of the holiday. The hotel is in a great position right on broadway a block or so north of the TKTS booth - we could see times square from our room (3205) which was very cool!!! its got a small pedestrian entrance on broadway but there is a proper garage entrance round the back accesible from both sides of the street for the cab to drop you and your luggage off. The lobby is very nice and the staff very helpful. we arrived very early on the red eye from LA and pre-registered - the chap on reception was very helpful and took on board our requests for a twin room on a high floor. he suggested we come back at 1pm (check in normally starts at 3pm) when a room would probably be ready. The room itself was lovely - big beds, very very comfortable with a nice big clean bathroom. they leave you a little bag of goodies to help you sleep (yes you're on times square which inevitably will equal a level of light and noise pollution!) a curtain clip to help block out the light and ear plugs etc., But to be fair we really didn't notice much noise at all and once the clip was on the curtains the light was gone!!The concierge was also very helpful - they pointed us in the direction of a great market on the sunday - i think it was 8th street and it was fab! Virgils BBQ was great for food (meatlovers will adore it!) and we had a decent meal at the ESPN bar too...One tip - if youi want to see wicked but can't afford the $126 tickets then have a go at the wicked lottery - ask at the wicked box office...basically a draw for front row seats at $26.50 each!!! Oh and don't forget to pick up coupons - every dollar counts!"
48,1789,"Sep 25 2009 	The center of the City	Great hotel location. Great sights to see and walk around. The room was simple elegant. The bed was very, very comfortable. Service was fine. I didn't not eat or anything here."
49,1789,"Sep 24 2009 	top of the list king of the hill. It up to you - new york new york	Stayed here for 4 nights in sept during US open, busy period but got an absolute bargain from simply-newyork. Room was spotless, nice big comfy bed, coffee maker, lcd tv, in-room safe. Room faced Times Square but still quiet enough to sleep even though we were only on the 19th Floor. The lobby is one floor up from street level where you have a bar and a coffee shop as well as the reception. No problems during stay here. 4th different hotel for me in New York and by far the best yet."
50,1789,"Sep 23 2009 	No complaints.	I struggle to find why, exactly, people complain at all about this hotel..I guess I am less fussy than other people!Great location, right in the middle of Times Sq. Rooms great, recently refurbished, bed one of THE most comfortable I have ever slept in. Great HD TV with good selection of channels.Yes the food and drink is expensive, but if you go into Charley O's bar right next door, they do all day happy hour so you can get a beer for $3 and selected wine/cocktails for $5.No problems with staff, all very friendly. Didnt use the health club so can't comment on it, but it looked good.I have no complaints at all about this hotel. They only reason I would not stay here agin is that by the 5th day of my trip I found Times Square to be a complaint pain to walk through. if you want to use the subway, rather than using the Times Sq station, use the 50th or 49th St stations which are much nearer and dont necessitate walking through Times Sq itself.Other than that, Crowne Plaza gets a thumbs up from me."
51,1789,Sep 21 2009 	Great location but pricey	Nice hotel with a great fitness centre although uless you are a priority club memeber you pay $10 per day to use it.Hotel is expensive especially the barApert from that a good hotel if you are staying in New York for a few days.
52,1789,Sep 20 2009 	awesome location	This hotel is in an awesome location in the heart of Times Square in NYC. The hotel was recently re-done. The king room is adequate in size. The bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is very small. Our room had new carpet and drapes and bed coverings but the furniture did not appear to be new. I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the bathroom when we checked in. Good thing I travel with Lysol wipes because I had to clean the toilet seat.....yuk. No other problems in the room. Eating in the restaurant is both expensive and frustrating. Breakfast was good but the service was terrible. We complained and the manager did take 25% off of our bill to compensate for our inconvenience. Parking is expensive....$39 a day and if you choose to stay longer you will pay $32 for any time after 2 hours once you have checked out. I would however stay here again because of the fantastic location even though there were several things I did not care for. I would not eat there again. There are wonderful and better restaurants right outside the front door.
53,1789,"Sep 20 2009 	great hotel	i would recermend this hotel to anyone, we were on the 46th floor at the back with views over the river,most things were in walking distance eg, empire state building , top of the rock, it is right in the middle of time square, the beds r wondeerful, rooms very clean and a good size, all staff very nice,would def stayy here again next time i vist New York"
54,1789,"Sep 16 2009	Best choice for discovering NYC	The group consisted of 75 people. Every single one of us was very pleased with the hotel.From the moment we walked into the lobby, check in took less than 2 minutes. I received the key cards for each room (one for each person, not room) and gave them out. The rooms were amazing! The beds were a dream, and the bathroom was plain luxury. The staff was very friendly and helpful. A few days into our stay they began recognizing us and even making conversation.The location is ideal. If you locate it on Google maps, you will see what i mean. Right in the heart of the city, with rooms on the left side of the corridor viewing Times Square. Subway stations are just a minute away, both directions.The only complaint i have is the fact that internet access wasn't free. You have to pay in order to use the wi-fi network, or to use the internet function of the 32&quot; TV in the room. Also for some reason, after 7 nights the key cards of all rooms were cancelled and we had to ask for them to be replaced. Though everyone was helpful. Security would come up to your floor to open the room for you, and a few minutes later would come back and slip new cards under the door.I can't comment about breakfast, restaurants, gym facilities since the group didn't take advantage of any of these.I guarantee a pleasant stay!"
55,1789,"Sep 10 2009 	Wonderful experience!	Excellent hotel! Very clean and comfortable. Wonderful helpful staff. Very centrally located to all of the sites especially Times Square and therater district. Great lounge on site. The New York Health Club is included and has a great workout room and pool. Would definitely stay again and would recommend very highly. If possible, stay in the conciege tower."
56,1789,"Sep 10 2009 	Great hotel and location	Stayed here for one night on September 8, 2009. Having stayed at other hotels in Manhattan that are impersonal, noisy and unkempt, I was pleasantly surprised by this jewel in the middle of Times Square. I stayed on the 44 floor and had a corner room overlooking Broadway. The room was in excellent condition, clean, with wonderful bedding, amenities, chaise lounge and spa-like bathroom. The concierge lounge on the 46th floor provided snacks and drinks throughout the day, a nice continental breakfast, and cocktails in the evening. Although at &quot;sold out&quot; capacity, the front desk service was superb with a clear understanding of providing top notch customer service. In fact, everyone from the doorman, security, bar and restaurant, and concierge lounge were consistent in meeting or exceeding the customer's needs. Very hard to find in NYC.Thanks for a great, but short, stay!"
57,1789,Sep 8 2009 	Great hotel	Excellent hotel with great staff. Totally lived up to expectations.
58,1789,"Sep 7 2009 	Great place great location	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza on a weekday when we went to NYC for a Broadway Show and then went to the U.S. Open Tennis the next day. We had a great experience at this hotel. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to anyone. The hotel is located right on Times Square. Our room had a view of the Square, while our friends had a corner room, with a view of the Hudson river.Check-in was very nice. We dealt with Vanessa at the front desk (Priority Club - no line) and she was terrific. We arrived at 11:00 and asked for early check-in. Unfortunately, no rooms were available, but Vanessa took our cell phone number and promised to call us as soon as the rooms were free. We checked our bags downstairs (the lobby is on the second floor) and went to lunch. Vanessa called us in about 30 minutes and said we could check in. (We had valet parked our car and this went pretty smoothly.)After lunch we walked back to the hotel and checked into the rooms. We had a room with a king bed. It was quite big - we had heard that the hotel had been recently refurbished and it looked new. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was fine. The room was quiet and the staff friendly; pretty much what you would expect at a Crowne Plaza.We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, but our friends did and were not really impressed. Their waiter was not friendly at all. There are plenty of good places to eat within two minutes walk.We got a good rate for the room ($219 + taxes) by contacting the hotel directly about a week ahead our our stay. It was better than the internet rate and the hotel was full when we checked in. The lobby was nice and spacious, with a bar and plenty of lounge seating.We have stayed at a number of hotels in and around Times Square and this was our best experience (location, price, room)."
59,1789,"Sep 7 2009 	Great place for a tourist!	In the heart of NY, this hotel is great for tourists, assuming its in your budget. The room was contemporary, clean and comfortable. The checkin / checkout took a long time and the staff was pretty stale.None the less, I had a great and comfy sleep!"
60,1789,"Sep 6 2009 	Great Hotel and Location	I recently stayed here for the US Open tennis tournament and had a very nice stay. Check in was very quick - no lines - room ready at 12:30pm - Rooms just had a makeover so very nice and clean, mostly all new - very comfortable bed. Linen spray nice touch - Negatives were no newspaper, tv channels terrible as no tennis was able to be seen in the room, had to go to the bar/restaurant didn't even have HBO. Regarding the location lots of people in TQ but if you walk a block over it is easier to get around. Breakfast was excellent, Continential came with my room and had oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, muffins, bread, cereal, cold meats, salmon, 3 types of granola, bagels - much better than the Barclay from last year. Staff was very helpful and I didn't feel they were cold being such a large hotel. I would definately stay here again."
61,1789,Sep 3 2009 	In the heart of the apple	very good location fine rooms not free internet and some problems with the luggages
62,1789,"Sep 1 2009 	Good place to stay	I arrived at this hotel and was given a room in 33rd floor, but asked if I could change to a room with view to Times Square and the persons working in the lobby gently acceeded and was transferred to the 40th floor. Negative things were that at some times the lobby was completely full and there was a queue either to ask for something or register. As well during nightime, the calls were not answered from the lobby, and I don't know but most 4 or 5 hotels I've been to work 24 hours, especially if they are this big. As well, when I wanted to see the pool before deciding if I was going to have a swim I was told to sign and register, even if it was just to have a look, and I wasn't allowed inn if this was not done. The room was excellent and very big and decorated with a very good taste. It had a big LCD TV, a good air conditioning system and an astonishing view from which even the Empire State building vould be seen. The bathroom was also very nice and clean. Room service was also good, fast and of good quality. It is a good option, especially for the view and location."
63,1789,"Aug 31 2009 	Great location nice place!	We really enjoyed this hotel. Great location with a super view of Time Square. The people were very nice and on Sunday they had a great little market going on right in front of the hotel. The Bed was cozy, the coffee maker with the pod system was pretty cool as well. It was very easy to find and the staff was very nice. The restaraunt and common areas were decorated very upscale and it was a pleasure to stay here!"
64,1789,"Aug 28 2009 	Fantastic Experience at Crowne Plaza in Times Square	People usually only take time to complain, I thought I would take time to write a positive review after a great 5 days. My family and I (teens 14 &amp; 15) in from Toronto spend August 22-26th in NYC.Upon arrival on the Saturday at 3 pm we were told that they were behind and we would have to check our bags into storage. Not an ideal situation after flying, but no big deal. I asked for a bellman and this request was overheard by a manager named &quot;Danny&quot; who promptly asked if were checking in or out. I told him we were checking in but rooms were not ready, he asked my surname and within 5 minutes we had a great renovated room overlooking times square. He approched us without us even asking! The room was recently updated with new furniture and plasa tv. Great location, great staff!"
65,1789,"Aug 27 2009 	Not in summer time	We spent 5 nights at this hotel, 10 days ago. We reached N.Y. at 22:00 so we arrived at the hotel near midnight. We were given a smoking room, though I reserved, a month before, a non smoking room. The explanation was that they are overbooked and the first to come is the first to be served. Although I wrote to them telling them about our late arrival that didnt make any difference. We were asked not to unpack so that the next day we will be transferred to a non smoking room and got a free breakfast as compensation. We did as we were told.The next morning we were waken up by a receptionist that reminded us not to unpack. We went away for the day and came back at 19:00 to find that we were transferred to a non smoking room, but our third bed did not make it and the room is for two. So we called reception and they said that they know and they will soon send it. We went to dinner and came back three hours later to find that the bed is still missing. To make a long story short  the bed arrived at midnight without pillows. So we asked for pillows and the bellboy went to look for them. He came 20 min. later with 2 pillows but with no pillowcases. As it was 01:00 we lost patient and went to sleep as is. Again we were compensated, this time by a gratis Internet. We thought that the maid will see when she tidies our room that there were no pillowcases. But on returning in the evening  there were still none. We decided to go to the Gym. We went in and took towels from reception and went to look for a Cross Trainer to find that they are putting out the lights. In the dark, we went back to reception to ask what was going on, and they said that they are closing up. So why didnt you tell us, we asked, with no answer. The next day brought the pillowcases. On that day we decided to take advantage of our compensational breakfast. I had some bread and some pastrami. There were a black/green spot on the pastrami so I just took it out. The same night I woke up to vomit. The hotel has great facilities and good location (in midst of the action) but something is not working as it should. Maybe when the season is over"
66,1789,"Aug 27 2009 	great hotel	the hotel was very nice and clean.The room we stayed in was great, we had a great view to Broadway. The room was big too, which is unusual in NYC. We paid $200 for the night and that is a great deal. (if you have AAA you can get a discount)The only thing we did not like was that the door in the bathroom kept gettin stuck, other than that the room and hotel were perfect.Downstairs you an leave you luggage in an storage room where you can come and pick it up right before you leave the city (and its free, except a tip)The restaurants right on Broadway are pricey so I recommend to got somewhere more uptown or downtown."
67,1789,"Aug 27 2009 	Very friendly helpful service	Got a free upgrade to top floor room, which had great view. Room was not very big, but was well appointed and had a great bed and spacious bathroom. Everything seemed clean and new."
68,1789,"Aug 24 2009 	Amazing!	Fantastic location, serivce, room quality, outlook, people, value for money luxury"
69,1789,"Aug 22 2009 	Very good hotel great location for diving in the Apple	I regularly go this hotel on business trip. For a long time I was boarding hotels in quieter areas (3d av/Lex) , I was fearing the crowd of Times Square. But once in the hotel and especially on higher floors you are away from the crowd. The rooms are spacious, quiet, well decorated. Many were renovated lately. Staff is nice but but just - It is a very big hotel so quite impersonal. and lots of traffic. But it is the case of most New York hotels. I would 'complain' about the long and slow lines at reception - happens too often. I do not use the hotel services much and could not comment on that. So much available in the city, why eat or drink or spend time in the hotel ... Well that's only my point of view. Higher floors offer great views to Times Square or the Hudson."
70,1789,"Aug 19 2009 	Would definitely stay here again!	This hotel was wonderful. No lines at check in. Allowed us to check in luggage at 9am. Room very big for NYC. Stayed at other hotels in Times Square that were much smaller. Had a corner room on 17th floor. Room very clean. More than enough room for 4 people! Nice view of river. Right in the middle of everything. Restaurants everywhere. I liked that there was heavy security. Felt very safe when they asked for room key at entrance to hotel and by the elevators. I liked that when we got off our City Sights downtown tour, the hotel was right around the corner. The only thing I didn't like was that there was no refrigerator. Would have been nice to keep our drinks cold when it was over 90 degrees! Other than that.....this hotel was perfect. Would definitely stay here again!"
71,1789,"Aug 19 2009 	Exceptionnal !	Great location, totally renovated. Very friendly staff, room is spacious and view was awesome !"
72,1789,Aug 18 2009 	Fantastic girls weekend	Visited NYC for the first time and had a wonderful experience. The hotel was great and in a fantastic location. We found the staff and especially the concierge extremely helpful. The drinks were expensive in the bar but we thought they were throughout Manhattan. The room we stayed in was extremely comfortable and adequate for the small amount of time we stayed in there. I thought the hotel was good value for money.
73,1789,"Aug 18 2009 	Crowne Plaza pleasantly surprised	Just returned from 6 nights at the Crowne Plaza. The 6 night stay was booked using reward points so I was pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to the Concierge floor which meant that we gained access to the lounge. This was a real bonus as breakfast was provided, which was of a good standard &amp; also afternoon snacks including cakes &amp; cheese.The location is good for most tourist attractions, but I did prefer the location of the Intercontinental Hotel where we stayed for the first three nights as this was much more relaxed. My 13 year old son loved the location, so it could be that old-age is catching up with me!My only minor gripe is that it can be a chore if you need to queue for reception, which at times seems a little 'swamped'."
74,1789,"Aug 18 2009 	Nice hotel concierge perks were good	Great location, right in times square. Views from the hotel are nice, river on one side and times square on the other. Full access to the New York Sports Club gym, which is huge and has a large variety of different machines I had never seen. Even though the website says you have to pay to use the gym and you can only use it during off hours, that is not true. The pool is in the gym on the 15th floor and is small with lanes that are permanently set up. Not really good for children who want to play in the pool.As can be expected for downtown manhattan, prices are expensive. The room was over $300 a night and meals in the hotel were quite expensive. The business centre is not free, it costs $1 a minute to use the computers and in-room wireless is $20 per day.However, if you are on the concierge floor (we were on the 44th), you get free wireless internet for your stay + free continental breakfast and afternoon snacks including pop, delicious cookies, fruit, and cheese and crackers.In our room they gave us, eye masks, lavender linen spray, and a drape clip.There was NO fridge in the room.Overall the hotel was nice, not overly modern, but comfortable, and was in a great location."
75,1789,"Aug 17 2009 	Loved the Crowne Plaza ... but wouldn't stay on Times Square again!	We recently returned from a six night stay at the Crowne Plaza and our first ever visit to NYC.We loved the hotel, - beautiful, spotlessly clean room. There was plenty of space all of us (we are a family of four with two teens aged 19 &amp; 17). Beds were so comfortable and inviting after a busy day's sightseeing and the maids were more than happy to leave plenty of extra towels/coffee etc for us. Despite having a room on the 14th floor and facing over Broadway, we were not troubled at all by the noise from the busy streets below. We ate breakfast in the hotel once only. It was not included in the price of the room and was very expensive but delicious!!!If (or when) we return to NY we would not stay directly on Times Square again, but that's just our choice and the hotel is about as close to the action as you can get!!!"
76,1789,"Aug 17 2009 	Disappointing for Crowne Plaza	We stayed here for 1 week from August 6th in room 3822. We booked a double double for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. This was not adequate, the description double double is more like 2 3/4 beds, resulting in sleeping top to toe for enough room! No up grade available apart from a king size bed and a camp bed which was not suitable for 4 people. Room was clean and modern due to their recent refurb, and the location is great however it ends there. Minor problems all week resulted in an overall disappointing stay :- constantly asking for extra towels due to only 3 being left each day, bathroom flooded 1 night, this was dealt with quickly but still not something we go away for. Reason we booked this hotel was the double double room and the pool due to having 2 teenagers and wanting to relax at the end of each day. The pool was run by NYC sports club and not the Crowne Plaza, resulting in misunderstandings when we wanted to use it. You need a padlock for the lockers which you must provide yourself, the one you use on your suitcase is fine however you will need to keep the keys on your person when in the pool!!! Or buy a combination lock from them NYC club, how enterprising of them!! They did not inform us of at the start of our stay. We felt that we were not wanted in the pool due to the amount of people paying to use it, hotel guests are not made to feel welcome. It was not a pool for relaxing in, it is split into lanes and is well used by New Yorkers for constant swimming. On our first night there was a function in the bar area and all the tables had reserved on them, where were hotel guests expected to sit for a quiet drink? At the bar! On our last day luckily we were checking out because a bongo playing guest had moved in across the corridor and decided it would be good to put a privacy please sign on their door and play their bongo drums to their hearts delight but not to ours. You can check in for your return flight home which is free for the first 10 minutes and this is adequate to checkin however don't use the facility to print your boarding passes leave this until the airport because you will be charged $1.50 for each sheet you print and 2 phonecalls home lasting no more than 1 minute each were charged at their standard rate at a total cost of $33.20. We have stayed in other Crowne Plaza's which have been head and shoulders above this one and being priority club members we have been disappointed. With all the problems we encountered never once was there a sorry.Location of this hotel is great however in future we would pay the extra and stay at the Marriott Marquis on Times Square.We did not eat at the hotel, having been to New York previously we found several places for breakfast some reasonable some no so. Cafe Edison on West 49th in Hotel Edison $37 for 4, Ellen's Stardust Diner on Broadway just up from Crowne Plaza oppposite side of street with singing waiter/ress $60.Lunchtime and evening places Maxie's West 48th the other side of Times Square was good and 3 NYPD officers came in while we were there which is always a good sign. All places to eat in Times Square are busy and ok nothing to write home about.Don't book a Broadway show when you get there unless you are willing to queue about 2hrs in Times Square for same day discounts, we used www.entertainment-link.com and saved around $200 on 4 tickets.Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller centre has fantastic views of all of Manhattan, There's no need to buy the sights card for the Empire State Building just use the binoculars when you are up there for where to look for the sights, no need to put your money in just look at the base."
77,1789,"Aug 16 2009 	Exceeded Expectations	You never know what you're going to get from a Crowne Plaza other than a really good bed. Since this trip wasn't for business and I brought my wife along, I was a little nervous about the quality we'd encounter, but I can tell you this Crowne Plaza's a really GREAT one!First, the location is probably the best you could ask for if you're going to midtown Manhattan to do the touristy things like sightsee, shop or take in a show. You can walk to any of those things. There are also multiple subway lines in walking distance to get you from one end of Manhattan to the other. I don't recommend this place if you intend to enjoy the more bohemian sides of NYC and stay away from tourists. As for the property, it appears to have been recently remodeled. The rooms are huge by NYC standards. The amenities in the room are first rate. I also must note that our view from the 42d floor was breathtaking and to all you PC Platinums out there, we got a great room with a Times Square view and access to the lounge on a reward night! Service was great; not overly old school stuffy like some NYC places can be nor overly informal. It was just right. If you like scotch (I know I do), the bar in the lobby has a great single malt menu and the pours are &quot;healthy&quot;.Overall, I would go back in a heartbeat and would recommend this place to friends going to NYC."
78,1789,"Aug 8 2009	Great location Long line-ups at check-in Good gym access High cost internet	We loved the location of the Crowne Plaza, right in the middle of the action in Times Square. When we travel to NYC, we rarely spend a lot of time in Times Square. But there's something that perennially draws us to the area as a home base. The lights, the people, the theatres, etc.The Times Square location is obviously amazing, particularly for someone going to NYC as a tourist for the first time.The Crowne Plaza was a comfortable place to stay. The beds were excellent, linens were clean, and a good choice of firm to soft pillows to suit any sleeper's needs.Check-in at the hotel was torturous. A long line of ~15 guests took forever to clear. The hotel must do a better job of expediting the check in process. Furthermore, when arriving at 3 pm, shouldn't one typically expect to have their room ready? We had to store our luggage upon check-in and wait to have our room cleaned. The inability to ready room in times for the mid-afternoon check-in provides a financial bonanza for the bellmen, who profit handsomely from the hotel's inefficiency.We loved the access to the NY Sports Clubs gym. There was no extra charge for accessing the gym. Typically, hotel gyms have a spartan selection of equipment. So, having access to the NY Sports Club gym on the 14th floor was a great surprise and treat.We did not like the exhorbitant cost to access the internet for a 24 hour period. With telecommunications costs continuing to decline, charging $15+ to access the internet for 24 hours struck us as excessive. Crowne Plaza must find a more cost effective solution for non-business travellers who merely want to stay in touch with family while away.Rating is average for a four star hotel. Check-in efficiency needs improvement. Internet access policy needs to be revisited. Gym access is a plus."
79,1789,"Aug 1 2009 	Good central hotel - but beware	Beware - we booked a room with 2 beds to accommodate 4. We arrived very late from London and the hotel was overbooked - lots of confusion and queues at reception. We were offered a triple room with a camp bed. We had no alternative to accept - (we did get a breakfast voucher to make up for it). We had to wait for the room to be set up. The room was great - great view over times square, but the small bed cramped the room and breached fire regs. Three of us in one massive bed was not a great start.As requested we had all our luggage ready by 10.00 am to be moved to our 2 bed room. Reception assured us by the time we came back it would all be sorted. Got back around 6.00 pm eager to unpack and shower and get back out. Problem - we were not put on the list that day for room change!! The guy on reception was arrogant and when I asked to speak to the manager he said he &quot;would see what he could do&quot;! We went up to the room showered, repacked and went out. On return around 11.00pm we got the room we booked. Totally shambolic and disorganised! Shame as without this I would have rated it highly. Went to use the pool but they wanted to charge us for swimming caps - not on their website as a condition for entry!!"
80,1789,"Jul 31 2009 	Location Location Location	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for two nights while on a quick NYC weekend get-a-way. It was my 14 year old daughter's first trip to the city so we wanted to stay in the heart of it all. We were able to use Priority Club points to stay with no cost other than parking the car. The hotel was very clean, beds were comfortable and the room was fine. To be honest, the room wasn't quite as upgraded as other Crowne Plaza's that I've stayed in, but again, we stayed at no cost so we didn't complain. The absolute best feature of the hotel is its location in the heart of Manhattan. The hotel staff were professional, but I didn't think they were as pleasant as at other CP's I've visited. No Biggie - it was NYC after all. I did learn a valuable lesson though, don't tip the concierge until you successfully get your Broadway show tix. I tipped before and we didn't end up getting the tix. Not her fault, but it seemed like a waste afterwards to come away with nothing. Overall, everything was great for our visit. While we were there we did the Statue of Liberty (GO EARLY in the day. We didn't have to wait to board the ferry at 9:00 AM, but the line was around the block at 10), Top of the Rock (again - no line with ticket in hand), Serendipity 3 for frozen hot chocolate, Wicked, shopping, etc."
81,1789,Jul 30 2009 	loved it	I went here with mi parents and it was cool its a modern 42 floor building just off times square if ur looking for big labels.i was excited as i love ny and it was mi first stay.the breakfast is overpriced and you should go out for it.you would save 10 dolars on just pancake alone.the room was spacious with a view of the hudson river and the noise wasnt bad for new york city!!ill be back!!!!!
82,1789,"Jul 26 2009 	Fab location	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza and it is so close to the every thing, the rooms were spacious and we had a club room and the lounge was great to head back and chill before heading back to your room. I would definately stay here again"
83,1789,"Jul 23 2009	Location Quality Value	My 8 year old daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights in July 2009. Our firts visit to NYC. We were in a twin room on 16 floor overlooking Broadway and Times Square (as requested). It was everything I hoped for and more. I can't fault this place. *Amazing AMAZING AMAZING views. *Location meant we could stay out till late without the hassle of subway/taxi*I felt incrediby safe in NYC and Times Square *We bought Broadway tix from the Concierge to see Mary Poppins. The show was magical. The seats were first class. I didn't mind paying the full price - you can line up at the cheap tix place a block away but be prepared, this could take at least 2 hours. *Hotel is quieter than you'd expect*Room was very comfortable and spacious, even though we had twin beds *Beds were INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE Concierge pleasant and helpful. Front desk OK. We had a small problem with the bathroom door. Was immediately attended to. Highlight of our stay was being invited to see the 4th July fireworks from the roof top/47th floor. This was a very generous gesture from the Manager of the 1605 Brassiere who was running the event. It was an unforgetable experience - thank you!  Unbelievable value for money for what we paid (heavily discounted). I would stay here again for sure. Also - my daughter and I did a Bike the Big Apple Tour - was AMAZING. She doesn't have much riding experience. Loved it. We did the Harlem Gospel Tour on Sunday morning. I organised through concierge. Was crap. If you want to do Harlem jump on the subway and see it for yourself. You don't need to be in a tour to attend one of the church services."
84,1789,"Jul 16 2009 	What's not to like?	This hotel had everything I could ask for, except maybe for designated express check in for Priority Club Platinum Elite members. The rooms were clean, quiet, nicely decorated, and we had a nice view of the Hudson River. Great location!! If I could give this an extra half point I would."
85,1789,"Jul 15 2009 	Really Good Location	We stayed in this hotel in November 2008, I had read a lot of the reviews on this site as I would normally like to stay in a top 10 hotel but I thought most of the complaints were things that wouldn't bother me anyway (internet speed etc). I also knew that the hotel had a full renovation so I also didn't pay much attention to the reviews about the rooms.When we arrived we checked in easily, our room wasn't ready so we left our bags and went for a look around.The hotel is in Times Square, literally you look out of the windows and there is times square. You are in walking distance to all main attractions. We only used a a taxi once to go to little italy/china town. Its just a small walk to 5th avenue where all the nice shops are.The rooms are modern, clean, have everything you need, and if you need anything else e.g. bathrobes, extra towels, blankets they bring it very quickly. Our room was cleaned every day and the bed was turned down in the evening.The beds are huge and are so comfy, after a day walking aroung NewYork it was perfect to drop into a huge comfy bed.We didn't eat any food in the hotel so I can't comment on that. There are so many places to eat that we didn't want to eat in the hotel.The pool/gym was very busy, we went once and I must admit I didn't like it. There wasn't any private changing rooms and the pool was all roped off for lane swimming, there was a small sauna which was also very busy. This isn't a spa/relaxing pool, just for serious keep fit people.All in all the hotel was everything you needed, clean, safe, modern, and best of all fantastic location. I would definitely stay again if returning to NYC."
86,1789,"Jul 5 2009 	Million dollar view	My daughter and I just returned from a 4 nights stay at Crowne Plaza. I was a bit concerned about staying in the Times Square area, however, needless worry.....we loved this hotel. The location is perfect, within walking distance to 5th Ave and the theaters. The hotel is lovely and the beds &lt;and pillows&gt; comfortable beyond words. We had a buffet breakfast every morning, which was quite good. Our only negative was a slow check-in.......but the wait turned out to be more than worth it. Our room &lt;Rm 2101&gt; was wonderful, a corner room with two double beds and a fantastic view of Times Square. We could not have been happier. We will certainly stay here again."
87,1789,"Jul 2 2009 	Excellent hotel - Mucho class - Right there in the middle of everything!	Everything was perfect, the rooms were amazing, the staff was more than friendly (Thumbs up to Nadine Jackson who coordinated everything for our group!) - The Crowne Plaza is the perfect choice for a stay in NYC! When I return to the Big Apple, I will be staying there for sure... A+!"
88,1789,"Jul 2 2009 	Comfortable hotel great location 	We are a family of 4, who stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 4 nights. We booked through Expedia with a flight on AA (would not recommend- uncomfortable seats and surly flight attendants) and were given a room with a view of Times Square (which I had requested if possible) on the 20th floor. Beds were comfy and big enough to share. TV was a good flat screen, and bathroom had a shower/bath combination. I called for extra towels several times and they were delivered along with bathrobes within approx. 10 minutes.We didn't have a safe in the room- it had gone for repair, so I had to put valuables in hotel safe. Not a major problem. I would have liked a small fridge in the room, but otherwise have no complaints at all.A great plus was the pool- not huge but very welcome to start the day and the staff would clear a lane for you. Both I and my 12 year old son really enjoyed the chance to have a good swim. We did not have to pay extra to use the pool, but did bring along swim caps which are compulsory. My 17 year old daughter loved the fact we were right in the middle of Times Square and all the excitement of Manhattan. We did the tours, but missed out on the 'Crown tour' of the statue of Liberty- the crown has been re-opened to visitors but it is booked up until August- so plan ahead if you wish to visit in the autumn -you can book online prior to your trip. We loved The Oyster Bar in Grand Central Station; Eileen's cheesecake (the best) 17, Cleveland Place; the market and Fulton Park under the Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn Bridge; The Empire and Comfort Diners (the latter for the blueberry pancakes especially); relaxing in Central Park and generally walking round this fantastic city and found New Yorkers friendly and very keen to give advice and directions.Can't wait to return and would fully recommend the Crowne Plaza.I would have liked"
89,1789,"Jul 2 2009 	Poor service couldn't care less about customers.	The problem with this hotel is that for your money you could probably enjoy a better stay elsewhere in Manhattan. There is no sense of customer service or satisfaction. It seems to be essentially a travel agent destination or a conference facility with guests farmed through. I booked a superior room which was supposed to be on the higher floors (in the 40s)and refurbished. I was given a key to a room on the 32nd....and it was old and worn out...basically I had been downgraded. I asked reception to change me to a room that I had booked and was eventually given a replacement but it was grudgingly and with a long explanation about how inconvenient it was for THEM! I mention this downgrade as other reviewers have mentioned this problem before, I think it may be practise at this establishment. The cleaning was sporadic and many of the promised facilities and extras never materialised. The surly and aggresive porters effectively mugged for tips us everytime we entered of left the building, one refusing to surrender my bag until he had cash in his hand!"
90,1789,"Jun 30 2009 	For Times Square this is a very very underrated hotel!!!	I would be surprised if this hotel doesn't increase their rates in the very near future. For someone who wants to stay in Times Square, this is a great location. For someone who likes a nice hotel, good value but very nice rooms, this is a great hotel. I was a little leery when my friend booked this hotel because I usually stay in midtown at a &quot;nicer&quot; hotel. When we arrived, there is a beautiful lobby that overlooks all the lights with a great bar. The rooms are far nicer than the W which is just down the street, and at a far better rate. The rooms are modern and newly renovated. The steam shower is incredible!!! The hotel is clean and the staff as friendly as you would expect for Manhattan. I would definitely recommend this hotel if they are looking for a medium range hotel which is truly 4 star quality."
91,1789,"Jun 25 2009 	Rooms toooo uncomfortable	Well, for sure not big enough for two adults and two teenagers - I have a 13 year old girl and 17 year old boy and was assured it would be big enough - NOT! The beds are stated to be &quot;Queen beds&quot; and they are most certainly double. IF they had been Queen as stated they may have worked for us but as it was we had my son on the floor two nights, my daughter in two chairs one night, and so on. They charged us 30.00 extra for both kids each night and it was very uncomfortable. Not a major thing but one that became annoying since they had on the reservations that there were &quot;four&quot; of us in the room - each night for all five nights that we were there, we only got three complete sets of towels and we had to call for the extra set each night waiting up until 2 1/2 hours one evening - I had to call back and they brought them right up. I complained and they gave us a voucher for &quot;two&quot; breakfast buffets.Location was wonderful - in the middle of Times Square-you could get to everything"
92,1789,"Jun 19 2009 	Look no more	Everything about our stay was excellent. The staff is very accomodating and friendly. Upon arrival my husband and I were told only smoking rooms were left...we informed the clerk that we both have severe allerigies and she immediately changed us to a nonsmoking corner suite with an incredible view of times square! This was much more than what we had asked for. The hotel is very clean, quiet, beds are comfortable, and it is one of the most reasonably priced hotels directly on times square. We had a late flight out so we checked out early in the morning and stored our bags at the hotel for free until we returned later in the evening."
93,1789,"Jun 16 2009 	Friendly New Yorkers- Great Service!!!	We stayed at the Crowne Plaze Times Square, NYC during April School vacation week with our children. The room was fine, clean and nicely done. I've stayed in more plush hotels but this room was fine. The hotel had a nice city feel and the location could not be beat! My experience with the hotel staff was excellent.....I truly did not expect NY to be so customer friendly. We asked to be moved to a room overlooking Times Square (we had really got a great deal on the web and did not expect to get any good view)- though they could not give it to us the first night they called first thing in the morning and said our room overlooking Times Square. They moved our things and that was that!!! We had a great week, great hotel stay and great service!!!! Would love to go back to NYC!!!"
94,1789,"Jun 16 2009 	Wonderful room and location	My husband and I stayed at this property from May 31- June 06. I was there on business, and he was there to relax and enjoy the city. I was very pleased with the hotel!! The rooms were spacious- large and comfortable bed, flat screen TV, big bathroom-for NY standards, the vanity had enough space for my toiletries, closet space, etc. In addition the view of our room was amazing- the lights at Times Square during the evening were incredibly romantic. I also loved that they hotel had an amazing gym!!! My husband and I took advantage of it on a daily basis: lap pool, exercise classes, weight room, aerobic equipment, etc. The gym staff was courteous and friendly- no charge for hotel guests. If you can, do the boxing class; it is a real killer. The hotel is centrally located, near shops, theater, restaurants, etc. I didnt eat at the hotel restaurant, so I cant comment on it. The hotel overall is very clean and well kept. We will definitely return to this property during our future visits to NY."
95,1789,"Jun 13 2009 	Great Location.	The hotel location is great. It is real close to Times Square. Used heavily for conventions, tours, and hi-end business meetings. Great deal if traveling with a Government Rate. Location is close to everything: Subway stations, restaurants, theaters, shopping, etc. Rooms are well equipped and Room Service is very good. Concierge staff is oustanding. They helped me out in selecting affordable restaurants every night. Cellular phone reception in rooms is poor. Wireless Internet access is $20.00 per day, if you have a mobile broadband card, better bring it with an additional antenna if possible. Front Desk service is packed almost all day. For any small question the staff requires you to make the long line. No refigerators in the rooms. Swimming pool is a plus and is free. You may have to pay to use the gym. If you want to avoid round-the-clock street noise (Broadway never sleeps) ask for a high floor . If you are a TV freak, verify that your room has a Flat Panel LCD TV, there are some rooms that still have tubes. Overall, a great place to stay."
96,1789,Jun 13 2009 	Great upgrades to concierge floors	I stayed two weekends in a row at this hotel using rewards stay and I was impressed with the upgrades I received. The first night I was given an Ambassador Suite which was close too 1000 sq ft. The feature I used the most was the access to the concierge lounge on the 46th floor with compl. breakfast and snacks. The view from there is spectacular. The second night I tried to check in at 9 AM and was given a King room also on the concierge floor.The hotels location close to subway stations and Broadway play etc. makes it my first choice for short stops in Manhattan.
97,1789,"Jun 11 2009 	Pretty good!	Stayed 4 nights at the Crowne Plaza there at Times Square! Nice hotel, comfortable room, great location! The thing I liked about it best was the bar/lounge area! Cool bar, great bartenders/waitresses, tasty food and drinks!We got a good deal directly on the Crowne Plaza website for a corner room. Our room was a decent size, clean, and the bed was very comfortable! Our view was facing the Hudson, so nothing that great. Would have liked a view of Times Square, but they said they were full and that was all they had left.We ordered room service twice. Pretty good both times.Overall I thought the hotel was nice, but here's a few things I'll nitpick about:1) As many others have mentioned, there's no fridge or mini-bar! They have plenty of space to put one in!!!2) The little shop downstairs only stays open til 11:00pm. There were many nights we got back after that and I wish we could grabbed a water or soda, but it was closed (and there's no mini-bar or vending machines). There were a lot of people coming and going after 11pm, I would think it would be profitable if they stayed open longer.3) The maids start knocking on doors before 9:00am. Even if you have the do-not-disturb sign up, you can hear them walking up and down the hall knocking on all the doors very loudly.4) Shower. The water pressure was very weak.Overall it's a good hotel in a good locations. A few minor things, but pretty good for the most part!"
98,1789,"Jun 8 2009 	surpassed expectations	Can't fault it. Stayed using priority pointsas regualr Holiday Inn user in the UK. Must admit I got an upgrade to room 4615. A corner room with an amazing dual aspect view of Times Square. the room had recentyl been renovated and was immaculate, but teally it was all about the view. We had access to the concierge room where we got free breakfast and soft drinks which was really nice. Staff were very pleasant but not overwhelming. Lobby was also lovely and although would rather stay on the UWS the location is a novelty and for many reasons can't be beaten."
99,1789,"Jun 4 2009 	Excellent location  fancy lobby good security	We stayed in this hotel during April. There are two entrances for the hotel , the smaller one is next to the Hershey's candy store. The other one is on the back and it's the car entrance.Once in you take electric stairs up to the lobby. About five people will help you through reservations in peak hour. The bar is just in front of the desk and it's got nice atmosphere. It gets crowded at nights.We stayed on the 25th floor, side views (not to Times Square but to the side of the buildings) so nothing fancy to comment. The room was clean and the beds were quite good. There was no free internet so thats a downer. 42inch LCD screen but no connection panel (you couldn't connect the laptop to the TV).Location is great , at least three subway stations nearby, close to the tickets booth for Broadway shows and excellent security, they required keys at night to let you through the lobby.There are several diners nearby , the one to the left (an italian) is a little bit expensive, but other than that , it's fine."
100,1789,"Jun 1 2009 	Good place GREAT place	We can't say enough about this wonderful hotel. Rates are well below average for the area (including cost of parking). We got a last minute deal and stayed in a corner room that was immaculate. Beds wonderful, bath luxurious and sparkling. View fabulous. Casual, but very, very nice here...a $85 million renovation helped. We took a nice walk over to to 9th Avenue where there are many reasonably priced restaurants, we had a beautiful diner breakfast for 10 people and infant at a place right on Times Square. We went to Times Sq. at midnight on a Friday - what a fun spectacle. Free entertainment. hotel about 1 block north of those red neon steps."
101,1789,"May 29 2009 	Great Value and Excellent Service in Times Square	--Great location!!--Purchased through Hotwire--excellent value--Nice, clean rooms--Excellent housekeeping service--Front desk and concierge exceed expectations"
102,1789,"May 27 2009 	Nice upscale place.	Hotel &amp; service was great. Down side: 1) no mini refrig. in the room we were staying in2) No 'free' internetOtherwise hotel, hotel associates &amp; location is great! Plenty of room for luggage's. Skip the restaurant in the hotel, no worth the time &amp; especially not worth the money. There are better pizza joints then the restaurant."
103,1789,"May 25 2009 	Great hotel and great room view in 2511	Crowne Plaza Times square is a newly renovated, perfect loction and lovely city hotel...highly recommended.My tip is to request a room over looking Broadway/Times square...a corner room. We stayed in room 2511 and the views were awesome.enjoy"
104,1789,"May 24 2009 	Nice Front Desk	After reading the posts, I had chosen this hotel to stay with my teenager daughter and her friend for her 16th birthday celebration. When we arrived we were greeted with ALL SMILES and helpful attitude of the front desk. The lobby was spotless and the area overall was beautiful. They had offered us a stay at another close hotel, I suspect they were overbooked and we were only staying 1 night. The girls wanted to take the chance and take a look. The front desk offered to hold our bags while we checked it out (in fact everyone who was there was asked if they wanted their luggage held while they toured the City until the rooms were ready). Unfortuately, we chose the other hotel so I can not give you a review of the room itself, but I wanted to be sure to let people know that the front desk people were very nice and helpful, the hotel is in a great location to everything in Times Square-walked to and from Penn Station, Gershwin Theater, Build a Bear. They did comp the room for us, so it was a nice added surprise to my wallet!My warning to country folks, like us, this area is crazy, tons of people, cars, busses and noise. It is a great experience and it was nice when the girls were totally aware that &quot;there were no stars in the sky&quot; -we have no street lites and few people even have lites on their driveways!"
105,1789,May 21 2009 	Great Location	Just spent 5 days in new york at the crown. First time visitor with family - two teenagers. Everything was great however I think they can go the extra mile and stock their rooms with a mini bar. After a long day of walking we wanted to enjoy a glass of wine in our room and were told that a cork screw could be arranged .....for $5. Don't bother going to the bar as they have been given clear instructions not to assist guests in these cases. ON the plus side...beds are ultra comfortable and the hotel location is very convenient.
106,1789,"May 17 2009 	awesome	Perfect location, amazingly quiet. I haven't slept as well at home. I ended up here using hotwire and even the price was fantastic."
107,1789,May 16 2009 	Great Hotel- Perfect location!	My Husband and I spent 4 days being NYC tourists and this was our &quot;home&quot; baseWe are celebrationg our 25th anniversarfy all year with little trips here and there and this was our first trip!The hotel is super beautiful and upscale. It is located right on Broadway near all the shows and a block or so from Times Square (near those weird stairs that people sit on- not near the seedy times square section)I found this gem because I stay here a lot for business. I joined their &quot;club&quot; and quickly earned enough points for a free night- so we only paid for 3 nights!We also added the breakfast option (10 bucks each- I mean where are you going to get a full breakfast for $10 each in Manhattan) and it was lovely.The room was amazing (no tub in the room...kind of a bummer as I love a good soak- but the linen is amazing-they have a sleep advantage program- complete with a little lavender spray and a soothing cd- but we didnt hear any noise-NONE from the 37th floor.The view from our window looked down on the Broadway show Chicago- but it was kiind of cool to see it. I bet some of the rooms have an amazing view of the skyline.We arrived early and couldnt check in but they let us store our luggage in the bell room and start our trip early!The maids kept our room beautifully clean and even came in while we were out to &quot;turn down the bed&quot; and freshen our towels etcThey had a free safe in the room as wellI only wish there was a fridge in the room to store drinks. We bought stuff at a Duane reede and used one of the garbage cans as an Ice cooler! There is ice on every floor- but oddly no vending in the whole place! (but there is a pricy little store)The hotel has a great little bar as well where we enjoyed some cocktails(quite strong) and munchies the first night. The waitress was super sweet and when she found out we were celebrating our anniversery she brought us a round &quot;on the house&quot;Suffice it to say-after 3 strong drinks my feet no longer hurt from walking all over Manhattan!I highly recommend this place
108,1789,May 8 2009 	Very nice hotel in Times Square	This is one of the better hotels in Times Square. The executive lounge serves pretty decent food and the bar in the lobby is very trendy. The rooms are comfortable and warm and service was on par with typical Crown Plaza hotels. I would recommend this hotel.
109,1789,"May 6 2009 	Nice hotel great location	We stayed here for a long weekend over Easter. The main reason for our stay was shopping. We spent 4 nights all of which were paid for using Priority Club points so it is hard to comment on value for money.So the location is fantastic. This is as central as central gets although Times Square is very very busy day and night so expect big crowds.Upon check in we were given a room on the 21st floor which was an accessible room right next to the lifts. Whilst the room was large, I was not keen on having my headboard next to the lift wall. I then discovered that the room had no safe so returned to reception.They explained to me that they had just undergone a refit (as others have said) and that they are waiting on safes for some of the rooms but that this is not a problem and after a couple of minutes of tapping on the computer we were given keys to a room on the 45th floor.We did notice later that evening that the queues at the reception desk were huge so it looks like we arrived just in time.So the room was an OK size with an OK view (we were at the back of the hotel with views towards the Hudson), a nice bathroom and a large LCD TV. There was the usual coffee machine in the room, the bed was comfy and overall, there was nothing to complain about. This was very much the standard you come to expect from Crowne Plaza around the world.We only drank and ate in the bar on the first evening and whilst the drinks were expensive (as you expect them to be in a hotel bar), the bar snacks were reasonable for the quantity and quality delivered.We did not eat in the hotel at any other time.There is a Starbucks directly across the road (and just up the road and just down the road and just round the corner) as well as loads of places to eat and drink within staggering distance.There is also an Irish bar literally next to the hotel front door that seemed to have a permanent happy hour and was welcoming and not bad on price.So overall this delivered exactly what I would have expected a Crowne Plaza hotel to deliver. This is a very large (46 floors) modern city hotel in a fantastic location and a great base to explore from.I would certainly consider using this hotel if I were to return"
110,1789,"May 5 2009 	Excellent Hotel	I don't undertand the negative reviews of this hotel on here.I brought my mother to New York for her 72nd birthday in April/May this year, and we had 2 standard rooms for 4 nights. I booked through Expedia and got flights and the hotel for less than booking Virgin Atlantic flights only direct! Both rooms were very large with 2 huge king size beds in each room. The beds were the most comfortable I have had in a hotel. We were in rooms 2604 and 2606. We had views of the river from the huge picture windows. The rooms were spotless - as was the whole hotel. Amazing for Manhattan given how grubby the city is! The housekeeping was excellent - cleaned daily with fresh fluffy towels and toiletries renewed daily. The rooms were incredibly quiet - not a sound at night. There was a flat screen TV, free tea and coffee maker replenished daily. A real hairdryer, shaving mirror, and an ironing board and iron were provided automatically in the rooms. And this was in a 'standard' rooms! I personally wouldn't bother worrying about an upgrade or 'view' because there are views from the lounge, restaurant and bar, and New York is all around you! Having said that our view of the river was beautiful and at night everything was lit up and we could see the boats on the river. For New York it was exceptional value.Location was brilliant - a short stroll from Times Square and the Hop on Hop off Tour buses were right outside. It was so central yet so quiet and relaxing - even though there was a large conference group staying.We had breakfast daily from the amazing buffet - all anyone could need. The restaurant was new and spotless with great views of Times Square. We had dinner one evening in the hotel. The food was the best we had during our stay. Portions huge and delicious, and a 3 course meal with service was 90 dollars for 2 - great value. The starter Tuscan soup was enough for a whole meal! I had grilled prawns in garlic then steak with frites. Lovely. The bar overlooked Times Square and was lovely and good value. The hotel was a calm quiet haven from the city and we loved it. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We called up an engineer one evening as my key didn't work - it was sorted out in a jiffy. There was internet access in the room, but that was 9 dollars per day - whereas there was also an internet room in the lobby with several computers and printing facilities and access was free for 20 minutes for hotel guests.Security is outstanding. They have guards at night by the elevators and you have to show your key card to get in. This was a great relief to me as my mother is 72 and it was her first time in New York. We didn't worry one jot about security. As I say I don't understand the negative reviews on here. I went into the Marriott Marquis and it was no where near as clean and new. Other 'brand' hotels - Sheraton and Hilton were not as well located and not as spotless as the Crowne Plaza. The CP is newly refurbished, spotlessly clean and the staff work hard and are extremely friendly and courteous. We had no problems whatsoever. Check out was super fast and my bill spot on. I was so pleased with my choice as it was such a special occasion. The check in even said happy birthday to my mother and hoped she would have a lovely stay. My mother loved it at the Crowne Plaza and thought it was wonderful. When others on here say there are better alternatives in the area they don't say what - and I certainly never saw any. Location, cleanliness, staff - all top notch. Even the staff at the Marriott looked a bit grubby. The staff at the CP were all in uniform and so helpful. The concierge provided advice and guidance on tours etc. and were so pleasnat and helpful. I would rate the hotel nearly 5 star. It was outstanding and I would definitely return and recommend. I can't speak highly enough of the hotel and staff."
111,1789,"May 4 2009 	Can't beat the location!!	I am a frequent visitor to Manhattan, but usually I don't stay in upscale hotels. This time, it was for my best friend's 40th birthday, and I had us and 4 of her family members flying in to celebrate!None of them had been to New York City, and they were awestruck with the views from the rooms (32nd floor). I booked two rooms, and there was more than enough room for 3 people per room (as well as closet space).the Crowne Plaza is half a block away from a great supermarket (for breakfast or snack stuff), as well as a Starbucks for early morning coffee.You really can't beat the location (49th &amp; Broadway - Times Square). You can walk everywhere easily (shows, museums, restaurant row)...Central Park is about a 20 minute walk, 5th Ave @ 49th (Saks, All American Girl) is about 15 minutes walk... A major subway stop is across Broadway.I booked our rooms with hotwire and got a great deal ($149.00 per night). The concierge were very nice and helpful.The rooms were kept nice and clean. Only drawback was there was no fridge in the room, but the ice machine was closeby.I would definitely recommend this hotel for a girfriend getaway (which was what we were doing), families, solo or couples."
112,1789,"May 4 2009 	Crowne Plaza Times Square	Went on a girlie trip to New York and WOW!! hotel was really nice rooms we're ideal for visit and location location location!!We grabbed coffee and crossiants to go from the hotel most mornings, a handy breakfast for being on the move, Bar was good and hotel prices as you would expect. We we're close to broadway so plenty show's to choose from. Plenty of Fantastic Restaurants to choose from too....Did'nt use much of the facility's as we we're too busy enjoying the city!!Taxis from the airport to the city was reasonably priced and they we're a fixedprice from the taxi ranks (beware of rogue taxis they hang about inside the terminal)"
113,1789,May 4 2009 	fantastic hotel and views	We stayed hear as part of our first wedding annivarsary.The hotel is ideally located and very trendyThe room was a corner room with two windows looking out on to times squareWe did not eat in the hotel so I cant comment on the foodI did feel on check in and check out that the reception team where under a litlle pressureTwo receptionist for an 800 room hotel seems very littleOverall a wonderful stay and will be back again
114,1789,"Apr 30 2009 	Room in poor repair no water running in shower or tub	My stay at this hotel was not a pleasant experience. They did not have the room I requested and gave me a handicap room right next to the elevator (4112). No closet. Paint on walls touched up and did not match. Got up in the morning. Coffee maker did not work, no running water in tub or shower so I had to take a shower in the sink. No manager on duty at 8 am when I checked out. Desk person promised to call me with resolution, that didn't happen. Personally, there are far too many good hotels in NYC to put up with this kind of service. I would not stay here or recommend to anyone!"
115,1789,"Apr 27 2009 	Middle of the action first-rate rooms	We booked this through Hotwire at a steep discount (though ultimately a reasonable price) and couldn't have been happier. The rooms are top-of-the-line -- new furniture, great bedding, excellent bathroom, and everything spotless. Huge by NYC standards as well. Three complaints: takes forever to get up or down to/from high floors on the elevator (normal), computer in the business center had a broken keyboard (kinda normal), and bellman somehow couldn't hail a cab in 15 minutes of our waiting (not normal, we ended up walking a few blocks to get one). Otherwise, a great hotel and perfect spot in Times Square."
116,1789,Apr 26 2009 	Great hotel	Stayed for a week using my priority points (didn't have to pay any local taxes) and got the upgrade to use the 46th floor concierge room. Used this a few days for breakfast which saved us quite a bit of money. Our room was on the 43rd floor and was both clean and modern with a flat screen tv. Bed was large and very comfy. Bathroom was spotless and a large double shower (no bath).The front desk staff were excellent and overall all the staff were first class. Hotel In the middle of the tourist area and central for everything. Couldn't fault anything about it.
117,1789,"Apr 26 2009 	Breach of Contract	I booked this hotel for the Easter '09 weekend for 3 nights. The reason I booked it was that breakfast was included in the price. I was attracted by the savings, because I was bringing the whole family. I confirmed this by phone a few days before arrival. However, when I arrived the hotel flatly refused to honour the agreement. I sent two fax messages to the reservations manager requesting satisfaction, but the hotel did not respond. I left embittered and disappointed."
