122,2026,"Jun 21 2008 	boooo	Cathedral Hill was brutal. I stayed there for 9 nights and it was a really big dive. The AC did not work properly. we were 'not allowed' on the balcony...do not even get me started on the elevators...they go to every floor but your own..unfriendly service, noone was particualrly helpful...we stayed in Burlingame at a fantastic Hyatt for the same price a night and it was a palace! We would have preferred to deal with the commuting than the seedy Cathedral Hill...oh and by the way it is in a location called the 'tenderloin' aka crazy drug addict, tranny, and prostitute area..will never return"
123,2026,"Jun 21 2008	Poor location	We stayed here after our tour finished and were just so glad we had spent the main part of our time in San Fran staying at the Radisson on the Wharf.The location of this hotel is very poor - and we walked down Geary Street looking for somewhere to eat and felt a bit nervous (daylight too)The hotel itself is rather nice, very helpful staff and the room was clean and comfortable. There were not really sufficient towels and the flush on the loo was *very* suspect!The computer gave 60 mins for $8 and it loaded quickly which was good.The pool was lovely and tranquil, set in nice gardens but no-one from the hotel around.I like a swim every day and when I went I felt intimidated with a large group of young people doing somersaults, back flips etc and taking over the whole pool.Their language was dreadful and they spent much time loudly discussing which drugs to take to the evening's party!Whilst this is not obviously the fault of the hotel I felt that a person seen to be about might have made it nicer for others.Once this group moved on then it was fine and everyone else felt able to return to the pool.There's not really enough sun loungers and the pool towels are small and rather threadbare.This hotel is a long walk from anywhere particular and the cable cars etc are also not nearby.I would definitely avoid it if I went back to SF and would most definitely stay on the Wharf.Mel's Diner over the road was quite nice, we daren't walk too far in this area looking for an alternative!"
124,2026,"Jun 14 2008	Huge rooms and big hotel	The gym is nice. The rooms are huge, and you can see the senery outside very well. Breakfast is not free, but it has two types of prices to choose from."
125,2026,"Jun 11 2008 	Great value and helpful staff	My husband and I spent a week in San Francisco and stayed at the Cathedral Hill Hotel. We saw several negative reviews of the hotel before our trip and were greatly relieved to have a good experience at the hotel. From the moment we checked in until we checked out we found every staff member to be friendly and helpful, something that isn't always the case at much more expensive places. We had a king room which was clean and comfortable. The carpets could stand to be updated but the bed was brand new. At such a low rate, the hotel can't be beat. Some tips if you're going to San Francisco--there is a bus stop in front of the hotel and we bought a 7-day bus pass in the hotel gift shop. Staff was very helpful with directions and suggestions. The concierge arranged tours for us and suggested restaurants within walking distance. There's a great place, &quot;Mel's Drive-in&quot; across from the hotel which is fun and offers good food. Also a good Japanese restaurant a block away. The hotel has an ATM in the lobby and a restaurant plus a take-out coffee shop."
126,2026,"May 20 2008 	OK for a cheap rate. Go nearer Union Square if you can.	Booked this as was looking for good rate for a 4 night stay - was good value. Location OK, but a good 20 minute walk to Union sqaure and 15 minutes to cable cars. Really needs a facelift overall in terms of rooms and back end. Reception is nice comapred to rest. Rooms were clean and staff very nice."
127,2026,"May 9 2008 	Cheap rack rates spacious stingey does the job	The rack rates (about $119) are as good as discounted hotwire or similar rates in other hotels in SF. You can stay at a lot nicer places for the same money if you use a discount booker like hotwire. BUT - that's not always an option, plus it's nice to know in advance where you are staying. So their rates are pretty fine for SF if you don't have the time or inclination to go searching hard.The rooms are spacious and fine. Nothing special. The usual - TV, bathroom with tub, desk, large - VERY firm bed.The location is superb - better than in the main shopping/cable car area in my opinion. We stayed off Taylor / O'Farrel the previous few days, and whilst it's near the cable cars, Van Ness in our opinion is far better located (the cable cars are next to useless - too long a wait). Van Ness runs right down to the Fisherman's Wharf and there are cheap ($1.5) busses running all the time. It;s not a bad walk either - especially the downhill direction :-) - It;s also a 10 minute walk back to the main shopping district on Market St.Also a short bus or walk to the Cow Hollow area for superb restaurants and shopping - very upscale.My major gripe with the Cathedral Hill Hotel is their mean / stingey streak. They really need to get up to date with charges. The extras they charge for and should not do:$12 a day for Internet access (no free hotspots in range) - this should be FREE everywhere now, and mainly is.Room service - Mandetory 15% tip plus $2 extra. This wouldn't be so bad if their menu was not so mean. For example - if you order their burger you pay Extra for onions!!! Extra for cheeese, Extra for pepper - Extra for anything. I mean, come on, paying for onions on a burger.This just reinforces the old reputation hotels had for stitching you up the moment you stepped foot inside. Needless to say we have paid for nothing - ordering food in from outside etc.A small but important thing they need to change. Make the guests feel welcome and inclined to spend money, don't force every cent out of them"
128,2026,"Apr 28 2008 	Ten Years Later - Still the Same Cathedral Hill Hotel	I got this great deal from Hotwire.com. $52 a night so I spent the next 10 days at the Cathedral Hill Hotel. It has been almost ten years since my last stay there and things have not changed a bit. The room had the same wallpaper (I compared old pictures of me in the hotel 10 years ago), the walls hallways had crayon marks on it, they were in the middle of replacing the old matresses from each room.Overall, it was a great stay.. It was close to everything especially with the muni bus right outside the hotel. This is a budget hotel. Cable T.V. consisted of only a few channels so that was a bummer."
129,2026,"Apr 19 2008 	Love this place and the employees	I've stayed here for years, and i love it. The staff is wonderful and the accomadations are impeccable. When in SF, this is my hotel of choice. I love CHH."
130,2026,"Mar 27 2008 	Old but Inexpensive Big Room	The place could use some updating. However, we found that it was clean. The hotel room was very large. We booked through one of those hotel discount websites and this was one of the cheapest options. There was a pool but it was not heated that time of year so we did not go swimming."
131,2026,"Mar 7 2008 	Old hotel in need of upgrading	Although the hotel is close to town it is quite old and is in need of some serious upgrading. 1st room, air conditioner didn't work properly, 2nd room TV didn't work. Waited well over an hour for a technician to come and fix the TV. Asked the front desk for a store location and the response I received &quot;I have no idea, ask the bell captain&quot;. The room is quite OLD- think 60s or 70s miss matching bathroom tile, dark and dingy shower, radiator, carpet, bed, linens- out dated and gross. Depending on your budget will depend if you go to this hotel. Unfortunately for me, all other hotels were sold out in San Fran. One night was enough for me."
132,2026,"Mar 1 2008 	These negative reviews are unfair!	I had business in the area, and decided to give this hotel a try, despite some of the very harsh (and undeserved) reviews I've read on this site! While the hotel is old, I found it clean, and the service impeccable. The facilities were adequate, and the staff provided a warm and welcome environment. What more do you want? If you want a five star experience, then stay at the Ritz Carlton! The Cathedral Hill Hotel is a great value, and you won't be disappointed. I would definitely give it a thumbs up, and recommend it to anyone looking for a good deal."
133,2026,"Feb 28 2008 	Fantastic Bargain	We live in northern California and travel south to San Francisco several times each year. We often stay near Union Square but this time opted for Van Ness. The Cathedral Hill Hotel was more than we had hoped for. It is in a great location, the room was comfortable and the price was excellent.It is a major plus in San Francisco to have parking included at the hotel especially with the hotel right on a main bus line. Breakfast was included and the buffet was a complete American breakfast. The room was quiet. Although the room wasn't the largest we have had it was more than adequate in size.In addition the hotel is within easy walking distance of a number of interesting and excellent restaurants, from Persian to steak.You can pay many times more for a room in San Francisco and not have anything comparable. This hotel is a real find."
134,2026,"Feb 19 2008 	Not as bad as the reviews..	After using priceline.com for years. And always being impressed with the quality of the hotels i was able to get for such a great price, this one had me worried. The reviews were horrible and i was worried. Now i will say this is not the nicest hotel ever. And the beds were a backache waiting to happen. It was clean, the staff was friendly and the underground parking was convenient. There are some great areas nearby. We had booked for 2 nights but decided to stay in wine country area for our 2nd night.. (another reason I love priceline.. the rates are so good i don't mind losing a night if we decided to change plans. Overall.. not a place to take someone to impress. But if you need a clean place in a normally pricey area.. not so bad."
135,2026,"Feb 11 2008 	It was alright...	The room was just alright on cleanliness. One of our lights was out, so essentially we had 2 lights that worked leaving the room pretty dark. Pretty view out to the couryard. Nice shower, but again, no light over the shower, so it was dark in there. The bed was the worst part though. I could feel the springs thru the hard mattress, so it wasn't a great nights sleep. Customer service was fine, no problems there. Would I recommend or stay there again, absolutely not. Paid a lot of money, but it was below average standard...."
136,2026,"Feb 11 2008	Never again	My family and I stayed at this hotel which is owned by California Pacific Medical Center and the American Cancer Society when a relative had a kidney transplant. The reservations agent was less than hospitable when I booked, but that could be overlooked if the guest room wasn't shockingly filthy. The first room we were assigned had food reminents and dirt on the walls and the bathroom floor is one I would never walk on without shoes and would rather not walk on with shoes. We asked to switch rooms. The second room had less dirt on the walls but there was scummy dirt on the hair dryer and once again a frightening floor in the bathroom. The website says the rooms have been renovated but a new bed spread, chair, and cutains is not the place to start. The carpet needed to be replaced, there was a brown mystery substance on one of the curtains, an exposed electric socket, the wallpaper is hanging and there was rust all over the bathroom-including a rusted mirror that is bolted to the counter and has seen God knows what in terms of use. I would not recommend this hotel until they actually renovate it. The location was good and the package rate ($89 which included parking, and breakfast buffet) would have been good if I wasn't waiting to catch something from the room. It's appalling to me that a hospital and a nonprofit could allow such filth. I also noticed that comments have been left about the ac units not working back in October 2007-there still not fixed! Stay somewhere else even if it costs more. One more thing-the shuttle to Cal Pacific does not run on weekends and nobody informed the family of this. In fact, the reservations person gave me the times for it and didn't bother to mention that it doesn' t run on the weekends. A couple of family members were waiting for it to come Sat morning. It's @ $7 cab ride to the hospital."
137,2026,"Feb 6 2008 	Great way to ring in the New Year!	The hotel was clean and the employees were courteous. Everyone was extremely friendly and accomodating. Walking distance to bars and nightlife, as well as food and groceries. The movie theatre across the street was a plus, too. Although we had to pay a raised rate to stay here on New Year's eve, the overall stay was very worth it and I would recommend this hotel to all."
138,2026,"Feb 5 2008 	Would not be my choice to stay in again if I return to San Fransisco	This hotel was included in our &quot;Californian Highlights&quot; tour in November. Although the hotel was basically clean it is overdue a complete overhaul. The furniture was a bit worn out and the curtains could have done with a wash. It was within walking distance of all the shops and other amenities. However, the hotel was very close to the area that is called the Tender Loin and it is not a very desirable area of the city. My friends and I walked out of the hotel once but returned very quickly. After that we took taxis wherever we needed to go."
139,2026,"Nov 23 2007 	great value would come back!	We booked the hotel through Priceline, and when reading some of the bad reviews, we were tempted to book someplace else... In the end we decided to give it a shot, and good thing we did!!!! The hotel, while certainly has seen better days, is quite nice. The rooms are perfectly clean, even if it needs renovation, but the bed was comfortable and clean, so was the bathroom... both essential to a good stay. Besides, while in SFO you hardly spend too much time in your room! The location was way better than we thought, a nice walk to Pacific Heights and the Civic Center, a 5 dollar cab ride to Union Square (you could walk but I don't know if you run through seedier areas, but at least the hotel area is quite safe), and buses right there that take you anywhere in the city. Also, the parking lot was a big plus in San Francisco, and quite a reasonable daily price ($20), we parked the car for our stay and walked everywhere.I would definitely come back, it's a great value and we had an amazing time in the city!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
140,2026,"Nov 16 2007 	Clean but that's about it	The hotel is clean, but it's like something out of the 70's. Everything needs to be updated. Can't even control the temperature in the room. If you are a techie, this hotel is definately not for you. The room only has three prong power outlets in the bathroom. I had to plug the laptop into the bathroom and use it sitting on the floor because the power cord wouldn't reach the desk. Moreover, the wireless connection is not free and it's terrible. I lost internet connection every 5-10 minutes.I would recommend spending a few bucks more and stay somewhere else. I won't be back."
141,2026,"Oct 23 2007 	Stay away if you want to get some sleep	Stayed here for two nights while on a brief trip from LA up to San Fran. The location of the hotel is ok, but it's still a good distance from Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square, the main attractions in San Fran. On arriving at the hotel, I checked in at reception and the guy who dealt with my check-in was very unhelpful. We had pulled up in our car right outside the door and did not know where to park it. The guy at reception barely told me where the car park was before shouting &quot;next in line&quot; having already taken my credit card details and getting paid up front for the accommodation. The car park is a nightmare to navigate, one of the worst I've seen and as for trying to get to the hotel lobby from the car park, it's like a maze. We ended up on the 7th floor of an adjoining medical centre, with our heavy luggage in tow, which no-one had offered to help us with and which we had to carry out of the car park up stairs as there were no lifts from our level. The room was adequate for what you pay for, small but sufficient, but the noise is terrible. There is constant street noise, the hotel is located on a block, so there's no avoiding it. The air conditioning is an old-fashioned fan/radiatior which whirrs all night and can't be turned off. The worst thing about the hotel though is the noise. At 5.30am some big-rigs pulled up on the street outside our bedroom window and proceeded to load and unload cargo...beeping and banging for at least an hour. The pool is small and the fitness centre has only 1 treadmill. When we asked to change to another room, a second guy at reception was not very helpful and said &quot;It's a hotel in the city...what can ya do...it's noisy, everywhere is noisy&quot;...great public relations skills there. All in all, it's a big hotel in the San Francisco city and people will be tempted by its location, but pay a bit more at a better hotel, it'll be worth it in the end."
142,2026,Oct 23 2007 	Better as a hospital	Stayed at the Cathedral Hill as part of a cosmos tour. The room was very shabby with wall paper hanging off the walls-lights that did not work-broken air conditioning and noisy from the traffic outside. Warrants a 1 star and that all.Surprisingly the restaurant was excellent and we had two terrific meals there the food being up to a very high standard.A member of staff told us that the hotel was being sold to a hospital group .
143,2026,"Oct 18 2007 	Cathedral Hill Hotel - pretty good value	I stayed for 2 nights in the Cathedral Hill Hotel. It was pretty good - the room had a small balcony and was quiet and comfortable. Overall the room was clean, and whilst not large, it was good value for money."
144,2026,"Oct 18 2007 	Would not recommend this hotel at all	Definitely not deserving of a 3 star rating. My 2 sons and I were travelling through US so booked through internet for two queens and a rollaway. When we got to our room no rollaway was there, rang desk but still didnt receive bed, had to sleep with my son, top to toe, very uncomfortable night with two feet in my face. Also on arrive noticed wet carpet by both beds, informed desk and was told we could not have another room as the hotel was full. I assume hospitality training is not essential to acquiring a job in American Hotels. Next day still no rollaway and a dreadful musty smell coming from carpet. Complained to desk and was finally moved to another room, this time with a rollaway bed that was lumpy and very uncomfortable. I should have saved my $20 per night as my son crawled into the bottom of my bed anyway. Fitness centre had one bike and a weight machine that was useless as the cord was broken, water machine was empty and room smelt. The service staff were very nice but unfortunately the reception staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. We ended up walking down the road a bit closer to Fishermans Wharf and got another hotel that was cheaper and cleaner."
145,2026,"Oct 15 2007 	Decent for the price!	Okay-this is a good place for the price and parking included. The staff was very friendly and even upgraded my room b/c it was my birthday. The room is a basic room and great if you are in and out. Don't plan on some exotic getaway, but worked great for my husband and myself who cared more about spending money on the sites, than on a room we spent only sleeping in. Good location, too!"
146,2026,"Oct 10 2007 	OK for the Priceline price -	We got this hotel in a Priceline bid. We checked other hotels in SF before we bid and were satisfied with the price we paid here vs the hotels website price. The hotel is definietley worn, but everyone we came into contact with was very pleasant. The room was clean and had plenty of warm water in the shower. The ac didnt work very well and we were on street side so it was too noisy with the windows open. I would request a nonstreet room if possible. I wasnt too thrilled with the area the hotel was in either, but we didnt stray too far from the immediate hotel area at night. The bus stops right in front of the hotel so that made it convenient not having to have a car in the city. We did rent a car one day and there is an Enterprise location below the lobby in the parking garage. If we went back to SF I would probably try to get another hotel in a different location, but for the three nights we were there and the price we ended up paying vs the other hotels we had a choice of, it was ok."
147,2026,"Oct 8 2007	OK as a city break	We had read the reviews on this site and were a bit concerned about the state of the rooms. Yes our room was in need of decoration, some of the very heavy wallpaper was begining to come away at the joins, a bit of filler to some areas and a lick of paint would have been helpful but the room was clean. The bed was great, with the bathroon well up to standard. Good toiletries and care from maid service. All electrical equipment worked fine and as somewhere to rest after a great day out in the city the Cathedral Hill was fine. Great location for exploring the city with the cable car close by, and close to one of the main gay areas which for us was an added bonus. The buffet breakfast was good too!! Car park was safe and convienient with a floor close to the lobby."
148,2026,"Oct 6 2007 	A good experiemce	The room was slightly dated but very clean. Single glazing meant a bit of traffic noise so earplugs were useful.The buffet breakfasts were excellent - plenty of fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals plus cooked options all included. Evening meals in the bar were very good - some interesting options like sea bass, risotto and asparagus made a change from the usual grills and fries.We bought city transport passes and there were very convenient stops just outside for the buses and it was only a short walk to one of the cable car lines.All in all, very good value."
149,2026,"Sep 28 2007 	Clean but scary... and it is not just the hotel.	My husband and I were going on vacation to San Francisco and read some tough reviews on this hotel. I decided though, for the price of $164 US/night, that I would stick it out and make up my own mind as well (something that other reviewers also said). In addition, I thought that the area would still be a prime spot to be in where it was supposedly close to Union Square. All these presumptions were proven wrong when my husband and I arrived. The hotel is indeed in need of a lot of work. You can tell immediately that they are trying to keep it intact for as long as they can without sinking too many funds into overhauling the hotel. The hotel is very outdated and although the rooms are very, very clean, the peeling wallpaper and questionable brown-grey carpet truly show the age of the hotel. The biggest test we placed on the hotel though was taking a walk down to Union Square in the early afternoon going east on Geary. From Van Ness Ave. to about Jones St. my husband and I had 2 thoughts: move fast and MYOB. Now, I'm a seasoned traveler. It's not like I've never seen a homeless person on the street before or someone sketchy that I should walk around and avoid. I have to say though, in this situation we raced through about 5 blocks of complete slum where we saw some pretty scary people and actually felt nervous enough to want to walk fast. After these few blocks the neighborhood finally changes up and does a complete 180 where you start to see some nice art galleries and business folks around. This was the last test before we decided that it was time to switch out to another hotel in Union Square. Truly, the walk from Cathedral Hill Hotel to Union Square was not long (approx. 9 blocks... 15 - 20 minutes) and we would have continued to stay at the Cathedral Hill Hotel for the location and reasonable rate however, given the slummy area we had to cross to get to Union Square and the old looking rooms, it was not worth $164/night. If anything, the rooms are only worth $99 at best and that's already pushing it. We ended up moving to the Hilton on 333 O'Farrell the next day where it was only 5 minutes away from all the shopping you can imagine in Union Square... and the area was much more comfortable to walk in! Overall, if you don't care about the scummy area and can put up with the old rooms then by all means stay at Cathedral. For all of you who are think like we do, take your money elsewhere where you know you will be happy for an extra $70 a night. My husband and I decided that we would truly hate our vacation in San Francisco if we continued to stay at Cathedral Hill Hotel. The last thing we wanted to do was to wreck our own vacation. Sometimes, money isn't everything and all of you should keep this mind if you are about to book at Cathedral Hill Hotel."
150,2026,"Sep 25 2007	avoid it if you can!	I stayed at this hotel as part of a cosmos tour of California and must say was not impressed. I had read reviews before I went and decided to make my own mind up. The room had dirty carpets, curtains and walls and non existant air conditioning, we were warned to only go down suttar road for our own safety and to avoid Tenderloin area which it borders. As 2 women on our own we did not feel safe at night at this hotel. I stayed at 7 other hotels on the tour and this was the worst and has put me of going back to San Fran. To be fair the tour should not use this hotel and use one either at fishermans wharf or union square. i will never use it again and advise my friends to avoid it. Also when i tried to complain to the front desk they took my email address and said they do not have complaints forms, umm I wonder why!!!"
151,2026,"Sep 22 2007 	Clean but has seen better days	Needed a place to stay in San Francisco that had parking. The Cathedral Hill Hotel fit the bill. It is close to Union Square, in a decent area, not to far from the St Francis which is high dollar. The Cathedral Hill was priced decent for it's location and the parking garage you got with your room. The hotel at one time was probably in the same category as the St Francis but has not been kept up in all areas. The lobby was very dated but you could tell it was still a very elegant place. Carpet and furnishings were all outdated but not threadbare and certainly everything was VERY CLEAN. The bed in the room and the towells and linens were all new and could not have been cleaner. The pool area was certainly fine as long as you are not looking for themed pools. I would most certainly stay here again. The staff at the front desk does tend to have an attitude and are not overly friendly but was always helpful if you ask questions."
152,2026,"Aug 30 2007	Not horrible but not 3 stars	I think that the people at Priceline might want to rethink their star system. The hotel is clean and is in a pretty decent location but the walls are paper-thin and the shower fluctuated between hot and scalding. If you are looking for a &quot;three-star&quot; hotel, this probably isn't the place for you."
153,2026,"Aug 18 2007 	The Wrecking Ball can't come soon enough!	The CH's days are numbered--as the prime lot the hotel is located on is soon to be San Francisco's newest medical center.The fact that the hotel is closing in the near-future is reflected in the poor upkeep of the hotel (dated decor &amp; dingy common areas)--but most notably in the Hotel Security.On day-two of a conference I was attending, the meeting director's laptop and briefcase were stolen out of the 4th fl function room. There were no security cameras in this area--which was surprising, since the hotel pool is adjacent to the function room. If you are looking for a hotel w/security, avoid the CH!"
154,2026,"Aug 9 2007	Pleasantly Satisfied	As others did, our family booked this hotel through priceline. I too read some of the online reviews and became quite concerned as to what to expect when we arrived . Even though the rooms were somewhat outdated, it was clean and nothing like I imagined. I think some of the people went overboard with their comments and basically were very picky travelers. The staff was very friendly, the bartender was exceptional and very helpful and the location was very good. We were able to get on a bus right outside the hotel to wherever we wanted to go. With a city pass, this was very convenient and economical. Both Mel's Diner and Tommy's Joynt were great right across the street. We discovered Polk Street (a few blocks away) which had several good restaurants and bars. The hotel has a rental car agency in their garage which was very convenient as we used it for a day to experience the coast and other things. We had a very pleasant stay for a great price. Couldn't beat that for our first trip to San Francisco."
155,2026,"Aug 2 2007 	Loved the Cathedral Hill very friendly	We read the reviews from Trip Advisor before we visited aswe were quite concerned due to this being our honeymoon.We contacted the hotel by email and expressed our concerns.The hotel replied very quickly and advised there was nothing to worry about and everything would be fine.When we arrived the hotel staff were very friendly, it was very clean and very well maintained.We were very happy to stay and it was very suitably located forUnion Square, Fishermans Wharf and China Town.Steve behind the bar works very hard and cannot do enough tohelp you. Thanks to Sean the Desk manager for a fantastic stay."
156,2026,"Jul 15 2007 	Convenient	For a middle aged Englishman and his wife staying for 4 nights 5th to9th June 2007 I found the Cathedral Hill easy to find driving from the airport.The checkin was speedy and pleasant and throughout all staff were helpful and courteous, although the barmans continual intro's of Hi Kids when I am 62yrs rather over the top. The hotel room had a pleasant view overlooking the main street , was very dated with worn carpets but was generally clean. The hotel parking in the underground garage I found. to be very convenient but expensive @$20 per night.We had an evening meal in the restaurant of sea bass which was delicious and inexpensive. The buffet breakfast at $12 was ordinary and we made frequent use of Mels Diner opposite the hotel ( a reproduction of Drive In diner complete with Jukebox at the table. All meals are recommended here both for price and portion size. It is quite a seedy walk to Union Square and I would not recommend it at night , although we were not approached by vagrants we felt uneasy.While in San Fran we visited Alcatraz which is a must and Fishermans Wharf which we found tacky with again expensive parking.If you have a vehicle drive down Lombard St ( the crookedest street in the world."
157,2026,"Jul 5 2007 	Reviews are Misleading / Not Bad At All!	I booked this hotel for $70 over the July 4th holiday through priceline and was incredibly disappointed when I came here to check out the reviews. However, upon my actual arrival at the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised. The front-desk staff was friendly and the room was large and clean. It is true that I did notice some of the wall paper peeling, but it was a small detail that I might have overlooked if I hadn't already been prepped to be on the lookout for it. I can't say whether the location is good or bad, but it wasn't a very far walk to Union Square (maybe 10 minutes?) and there is a bus right across the street that goes to Fisherman's Wharf, so overall, I think it was a very good experience for a 3-star hotel and the price that I paid...!"
158,2026,"Jun 26 2007 	Avoid	Dated rooms, stained carpets, wallpaper scaling off the walls, cramped bathroom, unfriendly front desk. The only saving grace was the size of the room (superior with twin bed) and a clean bed (no stained sheets &amp; bedbugs...thank god for that!!).The location is not too bad though...close to market street &amp; union square.Book this hotel only if you run out of choices on a crowded weekend...as was the case with us."
159,2026,"Jun 5 2007	Cathedral Hill Hotel - A place I wouldn't recommend to my worse enemy!	June 4, 2007 - This is the worse hotel I have ever been to. If you're looking for a really cheap hotel, with peeling wall paper, stains on the carpet, thin walls, and terrible customer service this is the place. It's ironic how the person who checked me in thought they were working for a 5 star hotel. I had to check him back into reality by asking him &quot;Why are you so snotty, you work in a dump.&quot; If you're looking for a place to only sleep in and do not mind feeling dirty after waking up, then the price is fair, however you're probably better off playing a few dollars more a night at another hotel to feel more comfortable though.I wouldn't even suggest my worse enemy to stay here.F. Lam"
160,2026,"May 18 2007 	Not too bad i've been in worse!	I came to stay at Cathedral Hill on a business trip, which was arranged by a travel agent.The location was great, but a bit of a walk to Union Square. There were a couple of nice diners that were across the street from the hotel, so that was convenient. The Jack Tar breakfast was really quite nice, tho a bit sparse. It had everything i needed tho.the rooms were a bit dated, but mine was comfortable. i could see that it needed some renovations and updates desperately, but its not anything that one couldn't handle.the staff were courteous to me and answered my questions at the front desk, and room service arrived on time. no real complaints here."
161,2026,"Apr 16 2007 	3 Star??? Perhaps in a third world country	I booked a room through priceline, expecting a 3 star room. I have had great success with them in the past, but they really missed the boat on this one. This place is in no way, shape, or form a 3 star. I went through three different rooms just trying to find a clean one with an air unit replaced within my life time. Everything was old and dirty. There were hairs on the sheets, stains on the carpet, and mold in the bathrooms. I finally called priceline's customer service and told them that I simply could not stay there. They contacted the manager and were able to cancel the reservations. I have never been so happy to leave a facility!The hotel will be torn down within the year, and it is quite obvious. If you are thinking about staying there-DON'T!!!"
162,2026,"Apr 11 2007 	Cheap: You Get What You Pay For	We booked a cheap hotel as part of a conference and were severely disappointed. After paying extra for a &quot;premium&quot; room, we felt like prize suckers when we first walked into the room. The carpet was old and dirty. The ceiling had a hole in it. The wallpaper was literally peeling off the wall. Clearly, no furniture or fixture had been updated in decades, and the room and bathroom smelled of mold. The TV didn't turn off except by unplugging the set. I had to call the front desk to confirm that we were, in fact, in a premium room and she assured us that we were. It was a dark, dank, unpleasant experience and I advise anyone to be careful to remember that you get what you pay for. Or, in this case, sometimes you get much less than you pay for. I doubt I would have found a worse room in a roadside motel."
163,2026,"Mar 31 2007 	Dated but still a great choice	Stayed at the Hotel last weekend (3/23 to 3/29). I tend to be &quot;the glass is half empty&quot; kinda guy so I was concerned with the negative comments that were mentioned in other posts.Location- as has been mentioned, it's not that close to Chinatown or Union Square although it is walkable. Take the bus or better yet, the cable car on California ave &amp; Van Ness- just a few blocks away. Japan Town is just a 10 minute walk away and a treat. The Cherry Blossoms were in bloom last week. The tenderloin is close by but really not that bad.Hotel- the lobby is dated but clean and comfortable. The staff, from the bell desk to the front desk were professional and very friendly and very helpful. The Jack Tar restaurant (on site) was great for drinks and dinner. I believe Monday thru Thursday nites they have a special $19.95 full course dinner for early bird diners (5 to 7pm). Room- as someone talked about before, I had a chance to stay in room 304 which has a king size bed. Huge room with a nice size bathroom. It gets the traffic noise from Van Ness but it's tolerable. The rooms were always cleaned very well- the maids did a fantastic job.Bottom Line- I would definitely stay here again. While not the closest to Chinatown or Union Square, San Fran has so much more to offer and the public transportation options from this location are fine. For the price, room size and staff this is a great place to stay. (Will add photos later)"
164,2026,"Mar 15 2007	Wonderful Safe Hotel	The hotel was big and bright so it's a safe place to go in and out, also because it's located on a big street. Right across is also a diner that stays open late - great food, great price. My college friend and I were on a budget, but wanted a safe place to stay since we wanted to visit the nearby bars and clubs, so this was a great choice. Just one word of caution: if you're arriving from SFO, the nearest BART station to this hotel is Civic Center Station (Very scary, especially at night, not kidding! locals all know this). So get off in another station before or after and you should be fine. The hotel is about 6 or 7 blocks from the Macy's Building in Union square which really isn't so bad. You will pass by a few bums on the way, just ignore them or take the cab. If you're looking for a nearby bar or club, the Element lounge (plays hip-hop and modern hits) is only down the street, just a few shops down on Geary. There's also a bar at the hotel but it's quiet and boring, more for the old folks......."
165,2026,Feb 23 2007	Fantastic Price easy location room was great	We stayed in a deluxe room with a king bed and private balconey for $110/ night! The room was spacious and the balconey was very nice. Overall I think this is an AMAZING bargain.The neighborhood west of the hotel is great. The neighborhood north of the hotel is fantastic -- cross Van Ness (east) and you're in the Tenderloin. Head south on Van Ness and your in the Civic Center. Neither are places to be alone at night. During the day it's fine.I'd recommend this for anyone.
166,2026,"Feb 23 2007 	Not a 3 Star Hotel	The location in conjunction with transportation was the only thing we enjoyed about the hotel. The T.V. did not work properly and no premium channels were available. I was surprised the hotel was advertised as 3 star-- at best it was a one star hotel (Stevie Wonder could see that). The service was o.k. and the staff was helpful. I couldn't help but feel that the hotel was built in the 19th century as the shower was made for someone 5 feet tall (I am 6' 2&quot;). If this place was newly renovated, I think they missed my room. The heat in our room did not work-- we froze all night long. Personally, I think they should have paid me to stay there-- talk about old and 'dingy' looking.The maid service could take some tips on finding out the number of occupants per room as they were 'skimpy' on the number of towels provided. We obtained an additional room during our five day stay and were quoted one price only to be charged a higher price-- talk about speaking with a forked tongue."
167,2026,"Feb 12 2007 	Nice time at the Cathedral Hill Hotel	My stay at the hotel was pretty good. We checked in for three days in February and stayed at room 304 which was a huge room (non-smoking) with a nice comfortable king size bed. The carpet looked new, our windows looked out into Van Ness and the front of the hotel. The heater worked. We had plenty of space. The bathroom was fine.I knew that the hotel was near the Tenderloin district, so don't take the #38 bus which runs along Geary, it's always crowded and there always seems to be so many homeless taking this bus. Take the the #2 or 3 to Market Street instead or #47 or 49 along Van Ness to get to the Wharf.The location of the hotel is not central, you really need to use the public transportation system if you don't have a car. If you do have a car, there's no problem as they have parking available. Overall, for the price and the hotel's amenities, it's fine."
168,2026,"Jan 16 2007 	Brilliant room	This hotel was magnificent, the friendliness of the staff on reception and the pleasantness of the roommaids, made for an totally enjoyable visit.We had booked a double room on the internet directly with the hotel. This room was enormous, it had all the necessary furniture to please not only the traveller, but the businessman as well. When we arrived we had two bottles of wine on the table to welcome us. A touch that not all hotel use to make the traveller comfortable, but it gives a real good first impression.The bed and pillows were really comfortable, and at last an airconditioning system that actually workedWe ordered two meals via room service during our stay and both times these turned out to be exceptional in presentation and quality.We found this hotel to be close to all the sights that San Franscisco is famous for. This was an added plus.There was only one negative point, and that was the plug in the bath did not work correctly, so when we took a bath we had to either try to keep our foot on the plug to make sure it stayed down or surround the plug with a flannel. This minor problem did not in anyway detract from the enjoyment of such sumptious surroundings.I would definately stay at this hotel again."
169,2026,Dec 25 2006	Nice!	This hotel was nice! I found it to be clean and small in size however it was nice to open the window to the outside to cool off or fresh air! I found the internet deal great if you plan on doing more then 15 minutes of work on it then its a good idea $ 10 a day is a right price!The room was clean and fit my needs and i walked to chinatown and Fishermans Wharf without any problems! But to travel in this city let me say walking you should be in shape and good shoes! The area around the hotel is odd as to the one side i would not travel at night and to the other is the Wharf! I like the price of Mel's Dinner across the street and the watering hole Tommy's is ok small and very busy! I found the hotel food good but costly and the bar staff friendly i would stay there again its a nice place why pay any more then this for a place to sleep and rest!Security is on the ball and around at night so this is a safe place to stay!
170,2026,"Dec 14 2006	No No No to the Cathedral Hill	We booked a room at the Cathedral Hill Hotel as part of a package. We had been in the lobby a couple of years ago and it looked fine. My husband and I ended up in three rooms in 24 hours. We arrived at midnight. We did notice that night the carpet was filthy. (I wore socks the whole time we were in the room.) In the morning, we saw the toilet was leaking on the bathroom floor. That was room number one. For a thirty dollar per night charge we upgraded. Number two was a large room with a couch and 2 queen sized beds. It had been renovated but the carpet had wine stains and the back of the couch looked as if a cat had ripped the material. But the toilet didn't leak. We were out for the day. On our return, my husband went to wash his hands and discovered something disgusting had backed up into the sink. Room number three was directly above room number two. The couch was only stained not shredded but nothing leaked or backed up the rest of our stay. The room was supposedly cleaned but there was a pretzel stick under the desk. For the next two days, we checked to see if maid service got rid of that pretzel. They didn't. So in our first 24 hours, we packed and unpacked three times. Upon complaining to the management, the $30 /day upgrade was dropped. We would never stay there again. If only we had checked with Tripadvisor first."
171,2026,"Nov 19 2006 	The old Jack Tar Hotel.	I grew up just North of S.F. My mother used to work at the Jack Tar Hotel in the 1950's. It's been the Cathederal Hill Hotel since the 1980's. It has a great parking garage that's free if you stay at the hotel. This is good because if you don't know your way around S.F., PLEASE take taxis or use public transportation. Having grown up with &quot;the city&quot; in my backyard, I can tell you that you will beat on your car driving it in the city. The traffic and the hills are murder on a car... If you can, rent a car.. Then you can go nuts and drive all over the city.The location of the hotel is perfect because it's next door to Tommy's Joynt. Tommy's is a S.F. landmark restaurant and watering hole. I've been going to Tommy's as long as I can remember for lunch with my dad (t)....... Tommy's is a local hangout that you most likely won't find in your &quot;S.F. Tourism Guide&quot; eventhough Tommy's has been in the same location for over 50 years. Everytime I travel back to the bay area for a visit, I make a point of eating at Tommy's Joynt for lunch. I like the Turkey Sandwich with a side of Potato Salad... All meats are hand carved before your very eyes. (Hofbrau style cooking) If you haven't been to Tommy's, You haven't been to S.F..The hotel itself is scheduled for demolition next year, (2007), to make way for a new hospital, so don't expect upgraded plumbing in your room. The lobby and meeting rooms are quite nice. They were having a convention of professional transvestite bowlers when we were there. The conventioneers were a laugh a minute.Overall the hotel is like any other hotel ready for the chopping block. You can find better rooms, but you can't find a better location due to Tommy's Joynt. Don't expect anything special from the rooms. They're old, musty and falling apart, and by next year they litterally will be, via the wrecking ball. But if you're stayingin S.F and like good food, this is a good place to stay because it is soclose to a lot of S.F.'s best places ( If you're a local) to eat. Make sure you eat at Tommy's... Also, House of Prime Rib is a few blocks to the North on Van Ness Ave... You can walk there from the hotel. It's on the opposite side of Van Ness about 8 blocks North. There's very little parking, but Valet is available.. It's within walking distance from the hotel... Do you like Prime Rib? If so, you will love The House Of Prime Rib.This is another eatery that MUST be checked out if you're visiting S.F.The hotel is old and musty. Tommy's for Lunch and The House of Prime Rib CAN NOT BE OVERLOOKED! They ARE the San Francisco experience.House of Prime Rib requires reservations. MAKE THEM... It's worth it!As a person that grew up in SF, I can tell you this, eat at House of Prime Rib and at Tommy's Joynt to experience the TRUE S.F. experience.Here's your plan:1) Stay anywhere you like in S.F.2) Get Lunch at Tommy's Joynt. ( Hand carved Turkey on sourdough + potato salad,+ a good German beer).3) Dinner at House of Prime Rib.After that, you can fool around the city as you please at your own discrecion.Like Pizza? Find Blondies Pizza on Powell near Market St.Have fun in S.F. I hope my restaurant suggestions find you well.I bid you &quot;fair winds and following seas&quot;."
172,2026,"Nov 16 2006 	Nothing resembling a Cathedral...	We wound up here because our &quot;booked&quot; hotel had a mishap. The history of the hotel is somewhat interesting - many famous people have stayed here, but you will note that none very recently and for good reason. It is actually a newer hotel - less than 50 years old - but more resembles a hospital on the outside. It isn't incredibly close to anything - Union Square is 10 blocks away (and not a nice walk down Geary Street at night) and Japantown is 7 blocks the other direction. Chinatown is 15 blocks away and the Wharf is an hour walk - but manageable. If you can't walk, avoid the main bus line, it is over crowded and nasty. A cab is your best bet but be aware that most of them take about the least direct route as possible. The hotel caters to business travelers.Our room was tiny and on the third floor. The outside temp was about 55F, but inside it was near 85F. The AC was running full tilt but a 90 year old granny with a walker could create more breeze. (Not to mention the air was warm...) The only option was to open the window and on the corner of two busy streets, the traffic noise was almost too much to deal with. The staff was not especially courteous - but neither were they rude. The only good thing is that we got to stay for Free - thanks to our other hotel. They do appear to have started some rennovations - but with the size of this hotel - looks like it could be a long time in the making."
173,2026,"Nov 15 2006 	A 3-star hotel just adequate rooms probably a fair price for SF	Our rooms were clean and adequate, and smallish. We booked the &quot;premier queen&quot; rooms. These are supposed to be their best rooms they have next to a suite. Well, I think some are better than others, but if our rooms were just adequate I'm not sure what the standard rooms would be like. It's located a few blocks further from the main shopping and dining attractions than other downtown hotels and as such is price a little lower than similar hotels. The best deal of all is that parking, which can be very expensive in San Francisco, was only $10 a day with a promotional package. The regular parking is $20/day which is still cheaper than many. When you compare hotel room costs in San Franciso, if you need parking for a car, be sure to find out how much it is at each hotel. One hotel we liked alot charged $42.50 per day. That adds a lot to the daily cost."
174,2026,Nov 12 2006 	OK at Cathedral Hill	The room was in need of some rug repair. The bathroom was clean but the shower was very dark. and there wasn't any fan in the bathroom. The lobby was large but dusty.
175,2026,Nov 10 2006 	Used to be nice...now not so much	We booked this on priceline and were looking for a three star in the area. We've been to San Fran before (family lives in the area) so luckily this wasn't our only vision of the city. The area itself was fine. I was worried about the whole Tenderloin thing but that wasn't an issue. This hotel seemed like it was nice in 1970 or something. Then when we heard it was being torn down we assumed that is why they haven't updated it. The bar area was really nice and they had a great little coffee shop but that was it. The room was horrible. I wish I had read the prior review first that said to change rooms because we must have gotten the low class room with stains on the carpet and the hardest bed in the universe. It was just dingy. I was really disappointed and have complained to Priceline about it (never had a problem before). It was cheap and it showed.
176,2026,"Oct 19 2006 	Mixed Bag	This must have been a grand hotel at one time but it is getting a little tired and ready for a major overhaul. Rumors of a hospital going on the site. The hotel is given a 3 star rating by some sites and I think that is stretching it a bit. I'd call it a pretty good 2 star. We booked on priceline expecting a 3* in the downtown area. When told the result and checking the reviews, we became concerned and called the hotel and priceline. My wife can be calmly assertive and the manager moved us up to a 'superior room'. The room was clean and beige with a nice view of the Japanese pool area and a little balcony. The bed was bad and we had a hard time with the springs. Again we calmly and assertively spoke to the manager (Scott) who moved us to a 'premier room' on 7th floor. He told us it was a 4 star room. It was very nice (still beige!) and the bed was amazing. Here are some pros and cons for this hotel: Pro: Good location-NOT a scary area, great restaurants in the area- Mels,Johnny's, Kyoto Sushi, friendly staff and very helpful, (a toast to Scott), very convenient transportation, plain but clean rooms. Con: noisy (old windows), big range in room quality, stair wells need a major cleaning, little things like burnt light bulbs, hair dryer didn't work, glasses weren't replaced, yadayada. They just don't seem to quite get it...! For the price and the people, we'd stay there again."
177,2026,"Oct 13 2006	Dissapointed	Have to agree with other readers, this really wasn't a great hotel.We were on an organised tour of the West Coast and this was our last stop before going to Hawaii for a week to chill and we were really looking forward to San Fran. Unfortunaly for my husband this hotel and the area surrounding it ruined his experiance of San Fran. Im not really sure why the tour company decided to put us in this hotel being so near the tenderloin area and we were very dissapointed-something i shall be taking up with them. On our way from Sacremento the tour guide told us to be in the hotel by 9pm, not something you really want to hear when your on holiday! On getting to the hotel and to our room we only had one case, they had put the other one in the another room, lucky for us they were honest enough to take the case to reception as i was going down to complain.The room its self was horrible, they had stuck things back on the wall with tape, the bed was uncomfortble and small by American standards, there were lots of Ants (friends of ours had to be moved rooms because of the ant infestation) and the shower was very questionable and noisy.My husband and i are not fancy travellers and had just spent the previous 12 days in budget accomodation which was fine by us but we were seriously unimpressed with this.The only good thing i have to say about this hotel was when we wanted to get a taxi the bell man was very helpfull and got us a very good deal.I think we were lucky to have good company with us and 3 nights was certainly enough at this hotel.This has put my husband off from ever going to San Fran again but i loved it there (besides the hotel) and if i get the chance to go again i would stay down by the Wharf. Had an amazing day there!"
178,2026,"Oct 9 2006 	Bad Service	Rude and unprofessional front/help desk. Checked me (and a bride from another party) in into the wrong room. Did not pick up breakfast order on the doorknob, so no breakfast arrived the next day. Had to order breakfast over the phone, and they charged me for food that I did not get, and I had to correct them. The front desk did not distribute gift bags that a bride had given them to distribute to her guests.Hard to get something from them without having to ask several times."
179,2026,"Oct 5 2006 	It IS the Pits!	We booked this hotel for one night because the we couldn't get three nights in the lovely Hotel Carlton and this was just around the corner. Well it's 3 blocks futher away from Union Square and closer to the dodgy Tenderlion area.Scott who booked us in was surly and rude. He had that annoying habit of just repeating himself over and over when we were trying to get something sorted.Which reminds me that booking with Orbitz was also the pits!We booked a shuttle to the airport on Orbitz and paid $30 for it but the hotel said they knew nothing about it and we had to pay again!The hotel itself was ugly. The halls smelled very strongly of bleach and the rooms looked like orignal 70s decor and not in a good retro way.We couldn't wait to leave this hotel, even after one night and put a damper on our last night in San Francisco."
180,2026,"Oct 3 2006 	This hotel is to use an American term 'the pitts'	I trevelled through California and Arizona and stopped at some wonderful hotels until we reached San Francisco and stayed at the Catherdral Hill Hotel. This hotel is dirty,aged and above all way past its sell by date. If your are intending to stay here? DON'T???? Travelsphere who are an english based travel company booked this hotel as part of our tour and I can only say they must have been very tight with the budget, because I would'nt let my pet dog sleep on the dirty floors in this hotel."
181,2026,"Sep 28 2006 	hotel good bar staff even better.	We really enjoyed San Francisco, the city was beautiful and all we could ask for. We read reviews of the hotel after we had booked and frankly were concerned, However the hotel is fine, the area is fine and there is a really good bus service to Fisherman's Wharf nearby.The bar staff are great, hats of to Steve for his entertaining bar work and we would gladly go back.Some of you reviewers are way too fussy!D BairdEdinburgh"
182,2026,"Sep 19 2006 	More than adequate	I first stayed at the Cathedral Hill -- it was then known as the Jack Tar -- nearly 40 years ago. I stayed in it again for two nights this month. The hotel was OK in the 1960s; it's still OK.Rooms are large and well kept. Bathrooms and closets are tiny (as were those in most hotels decades ago), but clean and supplied with the essentials -- including abundant hot water -- as well as an automatic coffee maker. A good-sized television set sits in a large cabinet with three or four large drawers.The Cathedral Hill has a good enough restaurant and a nice bar. On the patio (4th) floor there's a large &quot;Japanese garden&quot; that is a nice place for snacks, drinks, and just lounging about. (Some fourth floor rooms open directly onto the garden, or patio.)The hotel also has a newsstand and other shops. Parking is available; at US$22 a night -- not expensive by San Francisco standards (and the price allows unlimited ins-and-outs).Being at Van Ness and Geary, the Cathedral Hill is not located near San Francisco's main attractions; but the city is small enough that most are within a (somewhat long) walking distance. There are several decent restaurants in the area and Japantown, with the most reasonably priced sushi (and other dishes) in the city, is a five-minute drive away."
183,2026,"Aug 6 2006 	It's the pits! Sorry we didn't move to a different hotel.	This hotel was foisted on us by RCI time-shares, and was presented as an up-scale establishment. When we pulled up, I was very worried, but the lobby was in excellent shape, and seemed promising. What a disappointment! When we checked in, I specifically asked for a quiet room, as we have a kid with sleep problems. So, of course, they put us on the Van Ness side of the building which is incredibly noisy. Everything you read in the negative reviews is true. Frankly, the people who say this place is okay for the money are dreaming. After we got to our room, we had a lengthy discussion about checking out and moving to the Courtyard, where you at least get free internet. Cathedral Hill has Wi-Fi only, at a cost of over $15 per day. Even the Holiday Inn up the street had free internet service.Negatives: Rooms and hallways are filthy. We asked housekeeping to at least take care of the mildew mural in our shower. Was never cleaned up. Last 2 days of our stay one of the elevators was out of service and consequently had extremely lengthy waits to get downstairs. Absolutely NO amenities beyond a blow-dryer, iron and coffe maker. No refrigerator, no free internet, absolutely THE MOST uncomfortable beds I have slept in in 20 years of traveling for business. I want to know who the people were who posted the review that said they had wine in their rooms! What hotel was that?! And the icing on the cake: I heard people requesting refrigerators, so we asked for one to be sent to our room. Bien sur! Only $5 per day to have a refrigerator in your room. Outrageous. I'm surprised they didn't charge for the air we were breathing.Also, because of the proximity to the Tenderloin, there really are a tremendous number of homeless people around the hotel, and some of them are pretty aggressive about working the tourists.Positives: 1. Hotel security and the guys working the garage were very nice and very helpful. 2. It's across the street from Tommy's Joynt restaurant, absolutely the best meal buy in town. Tommy's Joynt consistently ranked as Best Cheap Eats in town by SF Chronicle. Van Ness Bakery across the street is a great bargain for breakfast. 3. You can get the bus to ATT Park right in front of the hotel.Net/net, no way is this a 3-star hotel. I have stayed in Super 8s that were far cleaner and better appointed.P.S. Mel's Diner is over-priced and over-rated. We thought it extremely expensive for the quality and quantity of food served, and either the wait-staff or kitchen are unbelievably slow."
184,2026,"Jul 20 2006	Watch your Valuables In This Hotel	A $400 IPOD was stolen from our room during our stay while we were out for the day. The hotel security and management was rude and uncorroporative, telling us &quot;you can't PROVE that it was stolen, so we're not going to help you.&quot; During our stay we found doors proped opened and hotel staff wandering in and out of rooms, leaving the rooms unprotected. Our conclusion was: THIS HOTEL IS NOT SAFE. It is shabby, in a fairly seedy neighborhood, and does not treat it's costomers with respect or courtesy. If you value your belongings, you may want to stay somewhere else."
185,2026,"Jul 20 2006 	beware that this is a 2 star hotel at it's best.	no words can express how bad this hotel is. stay away and be warned. dirty, old, not updated and waiting to be turned into a hospital. no ownership to improve the hotel."
186,2026,"Jul 20 2006 	Yuck!	I stayed here one night for a seminar. I was too grossed out to touch pretty much anything in my room. If there was a remodel (I read that somewhere), it certainly hadn't made it to my room. Not only was it dated but it was pretty filthy. There were holes in my walls!!!! I would defintely NOT stay here again. The staff was, however, pretty friendly."
187,2026,"Jul 18 2006	Wonderful stay	We were pleasantly surprised at the hotel, after reading all the negative reviews. We were staying as friends of the hospital that owns the hotel and when we made the reservations had a difficult time. The only rude employee we encountered was the one on the phone when we made the reservation! We stayed 4 nights at the Cathedral Hill, while visiting the city. The first night we did have to call down for extra towels and washcloths and they were sent up right away. We were on the 8th floor and the only complaint-the 8th floor didn't have a vending machine or ice machine, but we found some one floor down! The breakfast buffet was great! We visited the gift shop and coffee shop and no complaints there. However, never did figure out why Halloween decorations were on the windows of the coffee shop in July! We would definitely stay here again."
188,2026,"Jul 18 2006	our experience was just fine!	We also were skeptical after reading some of the reviews for this hotel, especially since it was a new addition to the RCI Point system. We had a week long reservation for a queen room (all that was available at the time) and needed one night before our week started. Having looked at the photos on the website we noticed that the beds seemed really &quot;square (in our experience that means hard) and the pillows very flat in the standard rooms so we upgraded for our single night stay. Our king bed was the most comfortable we have slept on, the pillows great and the room had a pool view with a balcony (this was a premium room for $60 upgrade). I wouldn't say the staff isn't friendly, they are just &quot;job focused&quot; and not people focused. They don't make conversation easily, but after a week we managed to get smiles and a few sentences out of them. If you ask for information about the city, you do get it in a concise sentence which is what some people may consider the rudeness, but really, most people we ran into in San Francisco were the same way-not very conversational. When it came time to check into our &quot;real&quot; room with RCI the clerk asked if we would just like to stay where we were (bed upgrade and room upgrade) and that it would just be the same $60 extra per night. We agreed, paying 60 a night for a hotel in San Francisco was unheard of. Sure we could have moved to our standard room and stayed for free, but this was vacation! All in all we liked the hotel, especially the central location and nearness to the California St.cable cars just 4 blocks to the north. One warning, DON'T go walking from the hotel to Union Square via Geary or O'Farrell-this area is very dicey and really looked like the set of a New York cop show. Many homeless, prostitutes and drug users in the doorways. No one hassled us (we obviously didn't belong in the neighborhood) but it was uncomfortable. Walk 4-5 blocks NORTH to California St (and Starbucks!) and get on the cable car to go to Union Square. You MUST eat at Mel's diner on the corner! Definately the cleanest shiniest diner we've ever been in! We would definately use this hotel again (and stay in a premium room)."
189,2026,"Jul 6 2006	Would visit again	After reading the reviews prior to travelling we were extremely worried at what we had let ourselves in for, but we did not need to worry. The room we had was lovelly and clean and spacious. Staff were also helpful. Its in a good location and there is a Mels diner across the road (I recommend the chilli fries)."
190,2026,"Jun 30 2006	Be Careful	After driving 9 hours to San Francisco we were met by a very rude individual at the front desk. My wife and I were exhausted. We are also large adults. We have never been able to sleep on a queen size bed. The clerk could see this and informed us that we would have to sleep on a queen size bed unless we paid an aditional $160.00 up grade. Our original reservation for a kingsize bed woud not be honored at this hotel at the agreed price. We had no choice but to pay an aditional $160.00. We were also lectured why we should never use hotel.com. Actually,&quot; this was our own fault&quot;. Over all, the Hotel was okay, but we did feel cheated. I would never recommend this experience to anyone. Customer service is also very poor. We met several rude staff. Management has a real problem here. This all reflects on poor leadership. The clerk went on to explain that this happens all the time here. What this means is that Cathedral Hotel does it all the time. Buyer beware."
191,2026,"May 18 2006	Checked out 20 minutes after checking in.	I would say this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed at, but I checked out 20 minutes after checking in. Even though we booked through priceline so couldn't be refunded, and even though we're beyond broke, we found another hotel immediately and just ate the cost. It was that bad.I pricelined the hotel - I got a supposed &quot;3-star&quot; hotel and so I wasn't concerned. How this is judged to be 3 stars is beyond me. This is a depressing, ugly, old, stained dump. If I had stayed here, I would have never wanted to relax, let alone sleep, in the room. Carpet, curtains &amp; bedspreads were dingy and stained. Wallpaper was put up shoddily and was peeling. Bathroom was tiny. The only up side was that the room was not too small... so there was more ugliness to love!To top it off, travelling with 2 kids, we needed 2 beds. The hotel had the audacity to say &quot;sure, we have availability, but priceline guests get charged $10/night extra for 2 beds.&quot; Never at any other hotel has this happened - not even at 4 stars we've stayed at. I guess this hotel must need to do everything possible to make money. I can't imagine anyone ever choosing it. Priceline &quot;chance guests&quot; must be what they rely on."
192,2026,"Apr 27 2006	Good choice near the city center	Very nice localisation (Cathedral Hill) in walking distance from the Frisco centre. Nice, clean rooms, outdoor pool, good buffet breakfast. Worth recommendation."
193,2026,"Apr 23 2006	Loved the Cathedral	Stayed at the cathedral Hill for four Nights in early April 2006, on reading some of the reviews about this Hotel arrived with more than a few concerns. But found to or surprise that the Hotel was really good,the bedroom was large and well presented but more important clean, the staff where helpful and curtious. Near to the Hotel are a few restaurants, cafes etc. I would recomend Mel's Dinner just across the street where we had many a good breakfast. On the whole we had a very good Holiday in San Franciscoand would use this Hotel on any future visits."
194,2026,"Apr 21 2006	Great location and price	My husband booked an airfare/hotel package online and this was the hotel he chose. I read these reviews after he booked but before our trip, and I was admittedly nervous. I must say that the hotel exceeded my expectations. The location is fabulous (walking distance to most of the city; bus stop right in front of the hotel) and the lobby/restaurant/gift shop/pool are lovely. We chose to upgrade to a room on the side facing the pool (away from the busy street) and we had a balcony. The wallpaper was unattractive, and the overall decor was dated, but our room was clean and all hotel personnel were helpful and friendly. There are restaurants across the street from the hotel, and they were good. Mel's Drive-in and Tommy's Joynt were especially good. If you are willing to walk and/or use public transportation, this is great. We're teachers, so we travel on a budget. This area felt like the &quot;real&quot; San Francisco, which we prefer (as opposed to the touristy Fisherman's Wharf). If you want a great location and price and aren't offended by dated decor, this is the place for you! :)"
195,2026,Mar 28 2006 	No words to describe this dump	Lets put it this way. The less said the better. Motel 6 rates higher. Rooms are incredibly dirty and dumpy.On a scale of 1-10 this hotel rates a -10.
196,2026,"Mar 19 2006 	Not as bad as it sounds-	I stayed here for 3 nights during a conference - read all the reviews on here and got really nervous. If you're looking for a 4-star hotel, don't stay here. But, I didn't have any problems with the hotel. My room was clean, hallways clean, meeting rooms clean, lobby nice and staff nice. So the toilet is hanging from the wall - who the heck cares? It worked every time I flushed it. (I'm short so this didn't bother me, but note that the showerhead is pretty low.) My room was always made up in a timely manner. The concierge was always happy to give directions, call a cab, make suggestions, etc. There is a nice little bar for happy hour and gift shop which always had some sort of fresh fruit and a good selection of sodas, juices, etc. I had breakfast in the hotel - $12 buffet - probably better (&amp; less expensive) across the street at Mel's Diner.All in all, it was a pleasant enough stay. Nothing stellar, but nothing wrong either."
197,2026,"Mar 11 2006	Fair - OK	Stayed 2 nights mid March. Hotel is in a nice area, a bit far from the tourist stuff. As recorded in other reviews the hotel is older. The lobby and restaurant are nice and was once 4 STAR HOTEL. Things have aged but are not terrible. Breakfast buffett is 11.00 and very good.The main drawback was the stained carpet and the lack of excellence. I think the hotel has accepted its status in life of being a reasonable alternative in price and location. I paid 60.00 on Priceline."
198,2026,"Feb 28 2006	Great price	My husband and I have to say that after reading the reviews posted, we were skeptical and even phoned Priceline with our concerns. Upon arriving though, we found the staff to be pleasant and helpful, rooms clean, price for parking comparable to everywhere else in San Francisco, location central, and the breakfast bagels and fruit wonderful. We have no major compliants and found our stay with Cathedral Hill to be pleasant and enjoyable."
199,2026,Feb 28 2006 	It didn't cost much and it shows	I booked this on Priceline and wasn't very happy when I found I was booked into a hotel in the Tenderloin. Then I came here and read the reviews and I was futher worried.It wasn't quite as bad as feared but it wasn't very good either. Location: right on Van Ness so it wasn't too bad. Just don't walk downhill across Van Ness as it gets ugly fast. Uphill isn't bad. Lots of restaurants around and Whole Foods Market is a 10 minute walk in a safe direction. Heading to Union Square? Take a cab.They don't have a place to park out front while you check in so you have to park in the red zone. Rather annoying.The lobby was very nice. The staff were very friendly. Lots of parking and $20/day isn't bad for San Fran. The better hotels are higher.The room was larger than expected. The carpet was stained like everyone here has stated. The carpets seemed very well worn and the stains seemed old. Even the walls had stains. The maid service missed a crumpled up candy wrapper on the nightstand. The bed was rock hard but the sheets were clean. The bathroom standard and shabby. The tub was small and very dark. The shower head is great if you're under 5 feet tall. The temperature bounced back and forth from hot to cold in the shower every 10 seconds. The toilet looked like something out of a hospital. The sink was old and scratched (one of those shell shaped things). Thin towels.Room service leftovers sat in the hall across from my room the whole day.The elevators were fine and all seemed to work.I was on the side street and it was pretty quiet except for a car alarm early in the morning. It was a Saturday night and I had the windows open all night and no road or people noise.I feel that even though I paid very little for the room by San Fran standards ($65 plus fees/taxes) I feel I overpaid for what I got.
200,2026,"Feb 7 2006	Having Second Thoughts? Dont!	I selected this hotel before I found this site. After reading the reviews I was nervous that I made a mistake and that we would have to stay in the slums of SF. I called the service that I used to book this hotel to try to cancel and they wouldnt allow it. I was prepared to find another hotel and take the loss ($136.00 for 3 nights) after checking out this property.Upon arrival I asked for an upgrade as it was a standard room that I reserved. The woman at the desk was very nice, but there were no upgrades for smoking rooms available. Apparently they had some rain damage and closed of some rooms until it could be repaired. She offered a non-smoking room but I didnt think that I could keep myself from lighting up so I declined.The lobby is very nice and looked like a 4 star hotel lobby. On the way to the elevator I was prepared to find them out of service, but all three were in working condition (I took each one during my stay). They were not creaky or slow. I was beginning to feel better about my stay. When we opened the door to the room (417) I was very surprised. Granted, the room is not a 4 star room (I would have to say 2.5), I was clean and the size of a standard room I am used too. I will have to say that the carpet has seen better days. There were some stains and some cigarette burn marks, but these are things that I am accustomed to seeing in hotels/motels. I could tell that the carpet was vacuumed. The beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean and smelled fresh. The air conditioner did not seem to be powerful, but it did work. There was some mild temperature changes in the shower, but nothing that would burn or freeze you. The toilet had a very powerful flush. There was also a coffee maker, iron, full ironing board and all worked just fine.Once and a while I heard other people talking in their rooms on both sides, but it wasnt anything that kept me from getting any sleep. There were no wild hotel parties, at least not on my floor. There was some street noise, but again, you are in downtown SF.Since we didnt rent a car we took advantage of the tourist desk to get bus information to where we wanted to go. I was so happy that we didnt get a car as everything is just a bus or two away. $1.50 gets you anywhere you want to go by bus. We would usually take a cab back and all the fares were below $10.00 including tip.We didnt eat at the restaurant in the hotel, but walked across the street to Mels Diner for breakfast, and for dinner and drinks (when we didnt feel like going to the clubs) walked across the street to Tommys Joint. The food there is amazing! Everything was far less expensive then I had expected. Dinner there was always under $20 for two. I cannot say how much the food there is to die for.Ok, now for a summary of this property. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone on a honeymoon or anything like that. This is an excellent place for a tourist who will only be sleeping and showering at night, and exploring this great city during the day. For price, I do not think that I would pay more then $90 a night. Location is the key here. Dont rent a car if you plan on staying in the city. If you plan on going to the wine areas I would recommend renting a car at the hotel for the day when you want to go. DO wear comfortable shoes! DONT take all of the negative reviews as fact. I have posted pictures here as well so you can make your own decision. I would definitely stay here again.If you have any questions, please feel free to email me!"
201,2026,Jan 29 2006	Fine for short stay	Stayed for two nights with a Tour group. Rooms tidy and clean although our aircon wouldn't turn off. Good cinema across the street and a few places to eat around the hotel if you don't want to eat in the hotel. Good bus links down to Union Square.
202,2026,Jan 14 2006 	the bed bugs bite! eek!	dingy carpet and three red welts from apparent bed bug bites. yuck. otherwise an uneventful and mediocre hotel experience.
203,2026,"Jan 5 2006 	Cathedral Hill Hotel-A Sure Fire Miss!!!	I have the misfortune of being @ the CHH right now &amp; let me say from the start, it was not my choice!!! As I understand it, the hotel is slated to be torn down in approximately 18 mos &amp; I don't think the day can come soon enough!!! I also think, as far as the staff is concerned, tear down day is tomorrow &amp; they are simply marking time until they find jobs elsewhere-I have NEVER seen such poor attitudes across the board as there is here. I asked 4 people, over the course of 2 days, at the front desk &amp; bell stand, for a list of local restaurants in the area-NO ONE could give me anything. Even a place like Travelodge can do better!!! The hotel itself is very run down &amp; the room I have, which they tried to charge me an 'upgrade' fee of $25/night for, is dirty, plain &amp; simple. The rug is dirty, the walls are dirty (I don't even want to guess what ran down the walls between the beds), the bedding smells dirty...you name it, it's dirty, ripped, or torn. However, you could say it's a perfect complement to the area the hotel is in-dirty &amp; rundown. AC in the room doesn't work, but at least the windows open &amp; it's cool enough that the lack of AC doesn't really matter, however, it is a further sign of the overall deterioration of the hotel. While the breakfast buffet this morning was pretty good, dinner last night was definately NOT-the only upside to either is that I'm ultimately not paying for it. Do yourself a favor &amp; stay far, far, far away from this hotel!!"
204,2026,"Jan 4 2006	No recommendation here	I booked this hotel online before I knew about Trip Advisor (can't remember which site I used). My 17-year old son and I were taking a college tour trip and stopping off in SF. He had not been to SF before and this hotel did not help the image of the city - on the website, they shot it at night and it looked pretty good for the price. In the daytime it looks pretty bad and it is in a creepy part of town - the Tenderloin district - not an area you want to walk at night. The concierge was never at his post so it was difficult to get answers to questions. I must admit there were some ok things about it - a cute little pastry shop for coffee and danish in the morning is in the lobby. Access to public transportation; i.e., the streetcars wasn't too bad. This area of San Francisco is just so ugly that it's a shame."
205,2026,"Dec 21 2005 	It's seen better times ...	The Cathedral Hill has seen better times. What makes this hotel attractive is the fact you can find very low rates. I paid $75 night WITH parking! That is cheap for SF. But, despite the low price and to me great location (I enjoy Polk St., all the Thai restaurants, and other great hole in walls) I doubt I'll stay there again and pay the extra money to stay somewhere else. I stayed there for 4 days including the weekend. This was my second stay so, I requested to be on the garden view side ... not much of a view but, very quiet since you are not facing Van Ness. But, given the low price, the Cathedral Hill as become known to locals as the &quot;Go-tel.&quot; On both Friday and Saturday night, once I stepped out of the elevator, I felt I walked into one of the Adult nightspots such as Mitchell Bros or New Century which are a few blocks down from the hotel. Let's just say lots of loud &quot;adult&quot; sounds (not the TV) and just hope you don't have a child with you. In addition, many parties were going on in the rooms too. In fact, on my floor security had to clear out two rooms due to a fight breaking out. Apparently, both rooms were filled with teenagers; drinking and doing drugs.During the workweek, the hotel was not as booked and it was more quiet overall. Being an ex-resident of San Francisco, I go back several years on business. From what I was told on this visit when meeting with local friends, the site where the hotel sits is going to be turned into a hospital. If true, that explains why the carpet is terrible, the decor is very outdated, and the bathroom is something to laugh at. I am very tall and the shower head did not reach the middle of my chest. I had to do yoga-like moves in order to wash my face and hair. The TV is terrible with a half-dozen channels. The room was pretty much the same as my last stay almost a year ago but, again, I was attracted by the price and figured I'd give it a second try.In fairness, this is what you get for the price being so inexpensive. The staff was very nice and they do accomadate. No issue with the staff. Although many here have issue with the area, that is secondary to me. I actually like the area as it is as real as SF gets but, when in a hotel I want to feel like I've escaped the outside elements; not bring them inside with me. I want to be able to walk into a room and kick my shoes off; not feel I have to keep them on because the carpet is so dirty. I want variety on the TV if relaxing ... I want quietness ... I want a clean functionable bathroom ... I don't want to hear what others are doing in their rooms. It's those reasons why I won't stay there again regardless of price. As mentioned, location is about as urban as SF gets. You do have to cross the Tenderloin to get to downtown. A walk to downtown shopping and the theater district is 15 minutes. So, you will see all the negative elements that SF has to offer (homeless, prostitutes, drug addicts, panhandlers). Polk St. is just one block down which has a mix of everything. The immediate area has everything from cheap good restaurants, small bars, clubs (straight, gay, and transgender), shops, coffee houses, as well as adult entertainment. City Hall as well as the Opera House are close by. Basically, everything is walkable. I say a great location if a single traveler, boyfriend/girlfriend traveler, clubber, nightowl, bar hopper, or couple with no kids who are on an adventure. Not recommended if you are a family with children or a business traveler who desires a quiet area and expect &quot;business&quot; style or &quot;executive&quot; accomadations."
206,2026,"Dec 2 2005	Not Great Not Bad...	I never thought I'd write a review of a hotel before, but here I am doing just that! After getting this hotel reservation via priceline.com, I was instantly curious as to the quality of this San Francisco establishment. I read all the reviews available, and after disecting each of them... I tried getting my money back before I even stayed there! Suffice it to say, the reviews were not at the THREE STAR rating, in my opinion. Unfortunatley, priceline.com lives by the credo, &quot;YOU GET WHAT WE GIVE YOU!&quot; ... so, basically I was stuck with it. As we approached the hotel, I was not really that impressed, as it's sandwiched in a somewhat dingy part of SF (albeit, moments from many key spots). As stated in other reviews, the elevator from the garage was out of commission, so we used a SERVICE ELEVATOR...very nasty! Once inside the hotel, it wasn't so bad. The staff was curteous, and accommodating (unlike many of the reviews). We got a room on the 5th floor, and it was huge! The beds were firm, but not that bad. It was definitely clean... after our check out the next morning, I decided it was exactly as it was rated... a THREE STAR hotel! If you have concerns, I can only help you out by saying... the price of $75.00 (which included tax, but not the $20.00 parking) was worth it. It's not a MARRIOTT nor is it a HYATT... but it's a step up from an ECONOLODGE!!!"
207,2026,"Nov 22 2005	Not up to standards	We transferred to this hotel because the hotel we where staying at was booked for the weekend. There's a reason this hotel has plenty of availability. The room looked like it hadn't been update in 50 years. The A/C barely worked. You might be thinking that SF is usually pretty cool at night why don't you open the windows. We'll our room was right over a busy street on a main bus line and there was a bar across the street. It was so noisy with the windows closed that we barely slept at all. Here a comparison. We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Downtown before we transferred here. You wouldnt think of the Courtyard as a luxury hotel. Well compared to the Cathedral &quot;Heap&quot;, the Courtyard was the Ritz! Do not stay here. Spend a little more to stay some place without holes in the carpet."
208,2026,"Oct 11 2005	Not the Plaza but not too bad.	After reading some of the reviews on this hotel I was a bit worried. I was traveling with my husband and 8-month old son and was concerned about the cleanliness of the room. Check in was a breeze ... parking was very convenient ($20 extra per day) - right below the hotel. There is very low clearance, though. We were in a Sequoia and it barely cleared. We opened the sunroof and could touch the ceiling with our hands. Parking stalls are also pretty narrow. We were on the 8th floor in a very clean, very quiet room. Of course, it was fleet week and the Blue Angels were performing. That was the only noise we heard, though. TV's had the general cable channels as well as Starz. Pay-per-view movies and games were available. Complimentary (small) bottles of wine were in the room too ... a red and a white.The bathroom is small and the shower is VERY dark once you close the shower curtain. There were nice towels and bathrobes to use. Also, there was a nice vanity mirror with a light for make up. We didn't eat at the restaurants, but probably would have had we not had existing dining plans with family and friends. There is a small espresso/pastry shop in the lobby, a bistro/grill restaurant (menu looked great) and then a more casual breakfast buffet area. There is a 24-hr Mel's Diner across the street. I was tempted to go grab some pancakes when my son woke up at 3 am :). There is also a pastry/donut/coffee shop across the street. There is an area to sign up for tours, etc. or general directions in the city and there is a small store for essentials and souvenirs. I met some friends for dinner that night and the hotel graciously called a taxi for me, escorted me out to the pick up area and told the driver where I was headed. Overall I think the staff was awesome and the accommodations were nicer than your typical Ramada/Best Western, etc., but not quite as nice as Westins/Hyatts. Of course, there could be nicer/larger rooms in this hotel ... we just pricelined it and booked the smallest one. As for the location, it is several blocks ($7 cab ride) to Union Square and a little bit further to the restaurants in North Beach. It worked well for our purposes, though, of visiting friends in different areas of the city.Check-out was just as smooth. We were on our way in about two minutes. All in all, not a bad experience at all. Nice lobby, nice staff and a clean room are exactly what I need in a hotel."
209,2026,"Oct 3 2005	Good Value ; Great Location	My boyfriend was finishing up a internship at the Chronicle in January. I came up for the weekend to explore the city. The first night I booked through Priceline; bid accepted at $50 +/-. We ended up with the Catherdal Hill Hotel. Hotel is in a decent location close to Muni stops w/lots of restuarants and stuff within walking distance. Used public transport the whole weekend, never more that 20 min. or one transfer to anywhere we wanted to go. Hotel not the newest, fanciest in the city and the rooms are small. However, everything was clean and maintained. We enjoyed our stay."
210,2026,Oct 2 2005	Never again - Stay somewhere else!	This hotel is located in an area that has more drunks and homeless then I have ever seen before. I suggest hanging out in pairs if you have to go out at night. If you stay somewhere just a bit more uptown you would be in a significantly better neighborhood. The room was small and the hotel set us up with a one queen bed even though I had called ahead to ask for a room with double beds. The hotel staff was &quot;nice&quot; but hesitant about switching my room to a double bed so you have to be persistant. Obvious priceline prejudice here...basically the attitude I sensed was... &quot; you reserved on priceline...what more do you want? &quot; The coffee maker was disgusting...the water reservoir had hair and black spots all in it and something that I could have sworn was a baby roach crushed up on the lid. Thank goodness I looked before I decided to use it. The blanket is old and pilly so I only used the white inner sheet. The air conditioner was broken and we had to have the maintenance guy come and fix it only to have it work for about 30 minutes. He basically vacuumed the filter out which kicked up all the dust into the room. Pass on this one...
211,2026,Sep 30 2005 	Hotel Needs Work Great Staff Though	Carpets in the rooms are at least 15 years old and filthy. Yuck! I was in a room on the 4th floor facing a busy street and it was noisy. Treffic all night. Staff was very accomodating and friendly though and changed me to a quieter room the second night. The lobby looks great. Room service was good. Coffee shop needs to open earlier. Sometimes it didn't open until after 7:00 AM. Fortunately there is a bakery across the street.
212,2026,"Sep 23 2005	A little dirty	When we drove past the hotel, I was immediately worried, it looked old! I was hoping that they had spent the money inside. They hadn't. It wasn't grossly gross, but the blankets were stained as were the shower curtains, to the point where you didn't want to touch it. We didn't spend much time in our room, so it was bearable, and it is a great location."
213,2026,"Sep 14 2005 	Yuck...	Tiny rooms, gross comforters with an even worse blanket, dimly lit bathroom with one outlet, shower curtain falling off and a shower head that hit my husband in the chest. The modem is next to the phone by the bed instead of by the desk and you have to unplug the light or clock to plug your computer in for power. The TV channels are all fuzzy and the A/C unit is on the wall where you pull a nob to turn it on and have numbers 1-4 to pick the temperature. The restaurant is fairly good, but the wine selections aren't great for the price.The concierge was hardly at his counter and there were never taxis so you had to rely on him to call for you. It made things very inconvenient.Overall we were not impressed at all."
214,2026,"Sep 11 2005 	A Priceline disaster	I'm a frequent visitor to San Francisco, and have used Priceline on a number of occasions to find rooms. I've generally bid on a &quot;four-star&quot; room, and have ended up in such typical business hotels as the Hilton and the Holiday Inn in the Financial District. My one bid on a &quot;three-star&quot; put me in the Pickwick, which turned out to be a decent enough experience. I turned to Priceline over Labor Day weekend after I discovered that my favorite &quot;budget&quot; hotel, the Castle Inn, could not accommodate me. I was unable to get a &quot;four-star&quot; or a &quot;boutique&quot; room on my latest attempt, and my offer of $72 a night for a &quot;three-star&quot; was finally accepted. When I was given the name of the hotel, I read the reviews here, and although I was taken aback by what I read, I hoped for the best.Unfortunately, the general consensus on the place turned out to be correct. I arrived at about midnight, and even though Priceline had guaranteed a late arrival, the desk clerk made a snide comment about my arrival time. The king room I requested was not available, and she claimed that the only room left in the hotel was a queen. She assured me, however, that I would be getting a non-smoking room, and I decided to reserve further judgment until I got upstairs.I knew I would be disappointed as I walked down the hall to the room--the wallpaper was marked and dirty, and the paint on the doors was marred and chipped. When I arrived at my room (659), I was greeted by a broken switchplate and the odors of both mildew and cigarette smoke. The lights came on to reveal cheap, scratched furniture with cigarette burns, worn and dirty carpet that was well overdue for replacement, and a rock-hard bed with a worn bedspread. The tub had rust stains, and the vanity was stratched and burned as well. The ventilation system was literally decades old, and during my entire four-day stay, I could not get any airflow in the room.The service was no better. Both the night and the morning desk clerks insisted that no other rooms were available, and since I was preoccupied with business matters, I eventually gave up and resigned myself to staying in the room. For two of the four nights there, I received no linen service, and my call to housekeeping went unanswered. Garage parking was $23 per night, including tax, which was well in keeping with prices throughout the city.I realize that $72 isn't a lot of money for a hotel room in SF, and I don't have a problem staying in budget accommodations. However, I do have a problem with the place being advertised as a &quot;three-star&quot; establishment, which, according to both Priceline and AAA, is one that offers special amenities. Quite simply, the hotel is in desperate need of renovation (both the physical plant and the front office), and unless you have no other option, I would give it a wide berth."
215,2026,"Aug 15 2005	It could have been worse....	Okay, I read the other reviews so I wasn't expecting plush accomodations, but the room I got was small and NOISY! Street noise on the Van Ness Ave side is continuous day and night. If only the air conditioning had worked even a little, then keeping the windows open would not have been necessary. Thank goodness the weather was very cool. First night there a big time afterhours party got cracking about 2am down the hall with about 50 loud and obnoxious people who had to be shut down by security, but not until 3:30am! The room itself was kept spotless by housekeeping, but the furnishings were very old and Motel 6ish. Room lighting left a lot to be desired. Three lamps but all with those fluorescent bulb inserts that combined with the yellowed lampshades made me feel like I had hepatitis everytime I looked into the mirror. The beds were reasonable good, but the blankets were old and pilled and the sheets had holes in them. The pillows were just plain awful. Put the rooms on the 7th floor on the fast track for renovation! The garage below the hotel was convenient, but very crowded and tight to get in and out. The restaurant on the other hand had a pretty good breakfast buffet daily for $12."
216,2026,"Aug 8 2005 	Was just fine	We were originally booked at another hotel that ended up being overbooked and they got us a room at Cathedral Hill. When we first drove up we were very leery. From the outside it looks just awful. We were even debating about just going home- but decided to check it out. We were pleasantly surprised. They staff were helpful, the rooms were small but clean. It appeared to me that they may have been recently refurbished. The chair and bed linens seemed fairly new. The biggest complaint I had was that the elevators were much too small for the size of the hotel and you often had to wait a while. The food in the restaurants was fine. We had a balcony room overlooking the pool that was nice (room 771) The beds were a bit small though. Also, in the shower they had some beautiful shower curtains that were a dark stripe and the liner was a tan color and it made it rather dark in the shower- not a very big deal. Over all we were very happy with our stay at Cathedral Hill."
217,2026,"Jun 16 2005	Best deal in town (for those on a budget)!!	The rates we paid to stay at Cathedral Hill were dirt cheap!! So, we expected the hotel to be horrible...but it's really not! It's a very good deal for being a budget hotel in the midst of San Francisco citylife. I was perfectly okay having my 4 year old son here, as well as my senior citizen relatives -- all of whom were comfortable enough with the hotel and the rooms to nap during the day! Like the other reviews, it may need a facelift, but the rooms were clean enough (though a bit on the small side), and the staff was very good. Beds were comfy, and as long as you don't open the curtains all the way (to reveal the wall between the windows), the rooms are bright and airy :) The restaurant downstairs has good food. And the LOCATION is GREAT! (5 blocks to Union Square, straight down Van Ness to Fisherman's Wharf, walk to Little Osaka) It's not California glossy style, but it has character and is more on the real side. I would definitely stay here again."
218,2026,"May 27 2005	It is an above average hotel	We just came back from spending one week in SF at this hotel. It is properly managed, resonable price and the location is pretty good: you can walk or taking buses to the main attractions. The hotel staff can book super shuttle to the airport for $13/person/one way. We have no problems at all during our time there and would hightly recommended it."
219,2026,"Mar 6 2005	Old Lady needs a facelift but she ain't that bad	Stayed at the Cathedral Hill, Feb 27-March 5. This old lady needs a facelift but overall it was not a bad place. She is ugly compared to the great architecture SF has to offer. Good location for the Civic Center/ Opera/Symphony. Only about 4 blocks to the California Cable Car terminus. Hotel food was basic hotel food...but being SF, dining out is part of the whole SF experience. Single women travelers may want to use caution as it is on the edge of the Tenderloin area, but Van Ness is a busy avenue. I was there during the week and it was quiet, but I did notice that on Friday more people coming for weekend getaways. It is nothing fancy but not the black hole of Calcutta either."
220,2026,"Feb 15 2005	Terrible!	This place is horrible, like a cheap motel at best. The walls are so thin that I could hear the neighbors opening their closet door. Also, I heard vacuuming outside at 9am on a Saturday morning, which ruined any chances of sleeping in. When I climbed into bed I noticed HOLES in the bottom AND top sheets! The carpet was really dirty, and the bathroom shower didn't have consistent water heat. It would alternate between really hot and cold. In addition, the towels were hard and scratchy and very uncomfortable. Totally not worth the $$. Stay somewhere else!!"
221,2026,"Feb 7 2005	I don't recommend this hotel there are a bunch of others in San Francisco.	I don't recommend this hotel, there are a bunch of others in San Francisco. I did not stay in this hotel, but they did not refund the money payed for the rooms. To bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
222,2026,"Feb 1 2005	This Place is FINE. Not a 5-star hotel but passable for those on a budget!	listen, i did the priceline thing and ended up trying to save some cashola and put in my price per night for a hotel: $65 and ended up with being given the cathedral hill hotel. it's not as bad as many of these reviews make it out to be. perhaps they paid well over $100 per night. i wouldn't do that, but $65 a night, pretty much with a good location (center of san francisco) and ease to walk to BART, MUNI is all over, close to the 101N approach to the Golden Gate Bridge and just as close to 101S/280, it's a good overall location. The rooms are average, but the people who work there are very nice. also, you can avoid paying to park, if you rent a car or drive to this hotel. you can park on many of the streets safely around, overnight at a meter FOR FREE! anytime after 6pm, the meters in san francisco shut off. since this is near city hall and many of the downtown SF municipal buildings, the meters are a plenty, but like i said, after 6pm mon-sat, you're good to go for overnight, safe parking. also, the cathedral hill hotel does charge a rip-off for overnight parking, if you want a garage overnight option, there are a few others around within a few blocks."
223,2026,"Dec 22 2004	Huge disappointment	My boyfriend and I stayed there for couple of days in May, 2004. I was very disappointed. We arrived there little before midnight, very tired from a sports event. The front desk staff was very rude and didn't want to corp with us for our needs. The room was very small and dirty. Uncomfortable bed, dirty wall and floor, old old bathroom. I thought it was a 4 star hotel but I'm sure you can find much nicer rooms at motels. I will never stay there again. I could have spent nicer SF vacation if I didn't stay there."
224,2026,"Oct 25 2004	Disappointing Room	Just back from San Francisco and i stayed at the the Cathedral Hill Hotel on Van Ness Avenue.The room that i was given was in dire need of refurbishment. The carpet and walls were stained/marked, the bathroom looked old and tired and the bed linen although clean was pretty old.I strongly urge you not to go to this hotel, but if you have already booked or go anyway make sure you do not get room 318 - it -----."
225,2026,Oct 23 2004	:-)	We stayed here in August 04 for 9 nights and were very impressed with the hotel and staff. This was our first trip to USA and we loved it so much we are going back to San Francisco next month although sadly not to Cathedral Hill. The breakfast menu catered for all tastes and my son especially liked the omelettes which was a first.
226,2026,"Sep 27 2004	Great swimming pool!	We (2 adults and 3 children, 3,8,11) stayed at the Cathedral Hill Hotel in June. It matched our needs perfectly - we were looking for a Downtown location with a swimming pool and adjacent rooms at a reasonable price. Our rooms were fine, clean, not noisy and room service was good. The kids adored the outdoor heated pool - it's circular, as warm as a luke warm bath and goes from 3' to 8'. The shallow end is roped off. Hotel location is great - there are a few decent sandwich bars directly opposite the hotel where we bought snacks, breakfast and public transportation stops right outside the door. Hotel is great value given its location and facilities."
227,2026,"Sep 23 2004	OHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOO	Well, made a roundtrip and stayed in the La Quinta Inn directly on the other side of Van Ness street, it was really nice.Three weeks later we came back to SF and unfortunatly the La Quinta was book out, so we had to take the Cathedral Hill Hotel.First the front Office was really strange, after two wrong rooms they finally gave us a King-Bedroom, we'd requested at the beginning.The room smelled and the carpet was totally dirty. Bathroom..... don't even wanna think about it.I don't recommend this hotel, there are a bunch of others in San Francisco."
228,2026,"Sep 21 2004	Disappointing stay	We have just returned from San Francisco and stayed at the Cathedral Hill for four nights. It needs renovating as the decor is quite old and the bathrooms need a facelift. Room ok otherwise, pretty basic and overlooking courtyard. The staff were very cool and not very helpful and when we asked if there was a room for one night extra all we got was a &quot;no&quot;. I also stayed at the Holiday Inn up the road and this was much better appointed and much friendlier staff. I would definitely stay at the Holiday Inn again. The Cathedral Hill is Ok if you want basic accommodation. The location is ok but it is quite a hike to get anywhere by foot. Not many good restaurants around either. And they also stop their room service early in the evening so order early!"
229,2026,"Aug 5 2004	Somewhat disappointed	Stayed here 3 nights mid July. The place basically needs a face-lift, it looks a little worn around the edges. Our room wasn't properly prepared but this was rectified quickly. 3 of us were staying but there were only 2 towel sets left each day. Room was at the front of the hotel which was a little noisy. Beds were very comfortable. I dont think its the best location - especially if you have kids. Its about 6-7 blocks to Union Square and the neighborhoods you go through arent the greatest. Value for money its OK - but you get what you pay for. Staff are good."
230,2026,Jul 31 2004	I would probably stay there again!
231,2026,Jun 24 2004	I liked Cathedral Hill a few years ago.

1,2029,Oct 15 2009 	Alcatraz is more appealing	I checked into this dump last Saturday with 2 friends - it was horrendous! The staff are the absolute rudest creatures I have ever come across! The Hotel is in a seedy part of town - and is quite run down and dirty. The smell in the room was appalling! - We stayed 2 hours and then checked out and went to another hotel. Alcatraz would have been cleaner than this dump and way more appealing!
2,2029,"Dec 5 2008	For Budge-Conscious Only	I wanted cheap, cheap, cheap near Union Square for one night. I paid $59, and I think this was still a low-end price in a neighborhood of hostels, run-down hotels, homeless, junkies and metal security gates on every door. The area is one of the most disgusting I have ever seen in any city. What is going on in San Francisco that this can't be cleaned up?  The good news for budget-minded travelers is that the hotel androoms aren't bad, and it is within walking distance to Market Street and the fancy hotels and department stores in Union Square. The tiny room looked &quot;refreshed&quot; with decent, clean linens on a king bed, a polished granite counter on the vanity and the same granite siding in the shower. They provide a bar of soap and a small bottle of shampoo. Security seems good, with double locks on the door. I also was rewarded with a perfect view of a whale mural a la Wyland from my wndow.But my advice is - if you can afford better, go for it.."
3,2029,"Oct 16 2008 	Hell hole	This motel was absolutely disgusting. We arrived on a Sunday and so the parking was tight, very few spots left, most were on the right on the footpath, so anyone walking past could scratch your car. The room just gave off a bad vibe as soon as you opened the door.The carpet had obviously been cleaned recently because it was still wet when we got to our room and it smelt horrible. The bathroom was tiny, the window looked out onto an alley behind the hotel (no fence) and also no flywire to stop anyone getting in throught it. There was also a sharps container in the bathroom. The beds had horrible plastic coverings underneath the sheets, which made a loud crackling noise anytime you moved. The beds also dipped in the middle so my partner and I ended up pretty much sleeping on top of each other in the middle of the bed. We were on a very tight budget and at $80 a night, this was the cheapest motel that we could find. I have stayed in much nicer cleaner hotels for a lot ocheaper than that. Spend the extra money and get a decent place, even if yo have a tight budget. I wish we had."
4,2029,"Oct 15 2008 	I'd rather sleep in a DUMPSTER!	Seriously, the guy who said he'd rather stay at a whorehouse is NOT KIDDING.I am covered in BITES! We did not get the RATE WE WERE QUOTED!There are PLASTIC SHEETS on the bed, like you'd put on a four year old's bed.The noise was UNBEARABLE!The ODOR is still on my baggage and clothing.Really, the proximity to fun things to do and the rates do NOT give JUSTICE to staying in this DUMP.I called Travelodge to complain...and they did NOTHING.I have stayed in many, many inexpensive hotels in my travels across this country and have never been so offended. If I could rate this pace lower than 'terrible' I would."
5,2029,"Sep 7 2008 	Don't do it!	This place is a dump! I read that it was remodeled...well if they went for a dirty, dated look, they accomplished it! There is no A/C, and it was a warm day when I check in. Windows do not have screens and it smelled aweful. My room was a small triangle broom closet with a nasty bed, nasty furniture, burn marks everywhere, probably from the crack addicts that seem to be there. I didn't stay, I checked out and moved to another hotel. I would not reccommend anyone staying there. There is also rumors of bed bugs, but I wasn't there long enough to find out but I can tell you, I would never consider walking on the carpet! eew! You get what you pay for, but this is all thumbs down!"
6,2029,"Jun 25 2008	Scabies should say it all!!!!	Don't stay here unless you would like scabies! This place is horrible! I would recommend staying in a whore house instead. Seriously, can't you guys wash the sheets, so people don't get mites? The locals call the alley behind the hotel, &quot;crack alley&quot;. You can literally watch people smoke crack and shoot up from your hotel room. The smell of urine and human feces is ungodly!"
7,2029,"Feb 25 2008 	dissater hotel	We satyed here in nov just over night before long haul flight. The only thiing u can say is its the cheapest hotel close to the airport!!! other than that it is a dump dark dirty and smelly, low rise buildings with little lighting in side or out, go some were else!!!!! remind u of scene from physcho"
8,2029,"Oct 4 2007	HORRIBLE!!!!	This hotel is absolutely horrible!!! It has dirty rooms (believe me YOU WILL NOT WANT TO SLEEP HERE) but also unbelievable staff. They are not helpful and as soon as you request some help or have a question they get rude - why would they not, after all you already paid so no need to be nice anymore!! There are other hotels/hostels that have low prices and actually provide SERVICE! In addition clean rooms where you don't have to feel disgusted lying in the beds. Be smart and don't ruin your holidays by this place!!"
9,2029,"Jun 20 2007 	Zero rating if I could	Cigarette burns everywhere, bathroom door didn't close, and a gap in the room door let in street noise and mice. Room window was street level literally ON the sidewalk, covered with grafitti, and a view of a liquor store and massage parlor. The end of our trip was during the Bay to Breakers run, so Friday was 2x regular rate, Saturday was 4x, and Sunday was over 6x rate. Fortunately found a friend of a friend who could take us in on the last night to save us from this place. Only other note is when they take your towels at 11am, you can't get another one until laundry is done at 3pm."
10,2029,"Apr 24 2005	I like the Travelodge	For the price I actually like this hotel. There are many fun and interesting spots just a short walk away. Right across the street there is a fun upscale bar called Martunni's. Like many areas in SF there are bad elements near by, but I see that as part of the charm of the city. If you prefer white picket fence neighborhoods, then maybe you should stay home.The price is right, as long as you book on Travel Lodge's web site. I would caution against booking on Orbitz due to their inflexible cancellation policies."
11,2029,Apr 21 2005	Awful Hotel	The room was very shabby and is located in a very bad district of San Francisco. We checked-out after our first night and found a much better hotel.
12,2029,"Jan 23 2005	So many places to eat. So liitle time.	Glad to find a nice room from the coupon book with good, simple dirctions. SF is a big place!!! Rooms were nice, once constructions is complete, will be wonderful. The manager was a great help with computer lessons."
13,2029,"Aug 19 2004	An absolute pit!	The worst, dirtiest, noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in, including hotels in Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.A disgrace --- amazed that TravelLodge will allow their corporate name to be besmirched by such a dump."
14,2029,"Dec 5 2003	Travelodge Downtown at Ellis and Polk St. most disgusting	There are not enough words to discribe one of the worst places I have ever stayed. How Travelodge can have a property like this in a beautiful city like San Francisco is beyond me. The rooms are rundown, dirty and smelly. You would be better off pitching a tent in Golden Gate Park. Do not for any reason stay here. Travelodge at Ellis and Polk Streets."
15,2029,Nov 28 2003	Filth Pit	This hotel has got to be the worst I have ever stayed in. Room 127. The hot water is non existant. The shower nozzle was falling out of the wall. Pubic hair in the bathroom. TV impossible to see. Cigarette burns in both bedspreads. Surrounded in an area full of prostitutes and destitutes. Do youself a favour and stay somewhere else.
1,2030,Check out the Red Room!	While I haven't actually stayed over night at the Clift I've had many business meetings in the Red Room. Service is always excellent &amp; I love the decor!
2,2030,"Nov 22 2009 	Clift - San Fran	Chic and quite trendy hotel in Union Square, awesome bar - redwood room and top chef in San Fran in its' restaurant........gets a little noisey in the bar though of a weekend, especially if you've been ut travelling all day and just want either a quick drink or to get straight to sleep, it aint gonna happen. Staff are very helpful and welcoming."
3,2030,"Nov 16 2009 	WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED AT - Rude staff and Management	I would not recommend staying at the Clift. The common areas including the Redwood bar are beautiful so its a great spot as far as night life. I checked into one of their one bedroom suites on a Saturday evening. The room itself was generous in size but the bathroom was quite small and there was no half bath in living room of suite. None of that, however, was my problem with the hotel. My experience About half an hour after checking in I attempted to call down to room service and request a buck of ice. However, neither of the phones in the suite worked. This was not a huge deal so I picked up my cell phone and called the main reception line to request the bucket of ice. The hotel receptionist asked what room I was in and what the name on the account was. When I replied she told me that was not the name on the account and I would have to provide her with the correct account information before she could help me with my request. I explained that unfortunately I could not tell her what surname she was showing in the computer but I was most definitely checked in that room. This went in circles several times before she hung up on me. Thoroughly frustrated I left the room and took the elevator downstairs to speak with the manager on duty. He apologized and said that he would speak with the receptionist as well as send up a bucket of ice and maintenance to fix the phone. Perfect. About, fifteen minutes later someone came to fix the phone. Thirty minutes after that my bucket of ice still had not arrived and I had to call room service again. When the bucket of ice arrived it was two hours after I initially picked up the phone to request it. Later that evening my girlfriend and I returned to the suite with two friends. Less than ten minutes later there was a knock on the door from two large security guards that our neighbor was complaining about the music. The music was on very low and it was a Saturday night but not looking argue we turned the radio off all together and continued our conversation. At this point the same individuals in the next room begin banging furniture around and hitting the walls. I called down to the front desk to complain and as far as I can tell no one ever spoke them as this continued for ten or fifteen minutes. At this point there is a knock on our door again, the same two securities guards plus the female night manager. She informs us that now we are talking too loud and that she could hear our conversation from the elevator bank. I explain to her that is impossible that she head us talking, at a normal tone, all the way from the elevators and ask if they ever sent someone to speak with our noisy neighbors. She dodged the question and continues that we are being unruly and she would have to ask the two guests not staying at the hotel to leave. I explained to her that we were very much in our rights as hotel guest to hold a conversation within our room. She refused to see my point of view or accommodate us in any way, by moving the other guest or us. At this point, thoroughly frustrated, I told her that if this was how the Clift hotel treated its guests we would be leaving, to which she replied fine. We called American Express back and luckily they were able to find us a hotel nearby, the Palace, that was much more accommodating despite the late hour.Upon checking out I spoke to the same manager again. I tried to rationalized with her that it was quite ridiculous to expect a hotel guest not to speak in their own room. She explained that the walls were thin and it probably had to do but the door adjoining our suite to the neighboring room. I cannot understand how it is the guests issue that the hotel is not properly sound proofed. I also asked her why she did not make an attempt to move either us or the next room over, before taking the extreme action of asking people to leave. She told me the hotel was fully booked. I find this hard to believe as I cannot see how we received an upgrade in a fully booked hotel.In all my years of traveling I have never been treated so poorly by a hotel. I never received any follow up from management apologizing or trying to deal with the situation. I called and spoke to one manager directly and although she apologetic for the situation she would not apologize for the way we were treated or the managers actions."
4,2030,Nov 10 2009 	Awesome!!!	Great Hotel! Close to everything you will possibly need......fun bar in the hotel lounge!
5,2030,"Nov 9 2009 	Hippest hotel in San Fran	Worth every penny, right in the middle of the city and close to everything. The rooms are a work of art, beds are comfortable and awesome lounge."
6,2030,"Nov 9 2009 	My Stay at the Clift	The Clift is well situated. Unfortunately, the rooms are incredibly tiny and worn down and the bathrooms are minuscule. A luxury hotel this is not. I have never stayed in a room with tinier bathrooms. It was quite depressing. The concierge in the late daytime wasn't particularly helpful. I would not recommend this hotel."
7,2030,"Nov 9 2009 	This unique hotel pleasantly exceeded my expectations	I was able to land a fantastic rate at this hip, stylish hotel in downtown San Francisco. The desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful over the phone and greeted me by name. The concierge desk was prompt and assisted us correctly. Our room was extremely TINY but neat, clean and orderly. Everything in our room worked and was in good shape. The lobby decor is dimly lit with dark wood overtones, but the hallways on each floor were playfully painted lavender and silver. Our room was bright and cheerful, and the large mirrors on each side of the bed made the room look larger. The first floor was pretty crowded with bar/club patrons on a Saturday night, but we stayed on the 14th floor and didn't hear a peep.For the price, I'd definitely stay there again."
8,2030,"Nov 6 2009 	Not bad.	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while attending a conference. Upon arrival, we were impressed with the lobby. It was very modern and the decor was great. We went up to our room and were a little disappointed. Our bathroom was the size of a cruise ship bathroom...tiny. Our shower did not drain properly either. However, the service we received was very good. So, bottom line, it was not bad. The hotel is centrally located and since the service was good I would recommend it. However, be aware of the miniscule bathroom."
9,2030,"Oct 23 2009 	Trendy with NO Substance.	The cost was too high for the services provided. I came to the hotel from the Four Seasons in Los Angeles where the rooms were twice as big for half the price with all the amenities. The edgy design does not merit top notch price and lack of amenities. On top of that, the tub wouldn't drain, the furniture in the room and the common areas is damaged and looking worn. The front desk staff, could not tell me what amenities they had, so I didn't know there was a gym until my stay was over. The concierge had not idea of alternative wine tours which was the one that picks up in the hotel or an $80 dollar an hour limo. They had no clue of the in-between or interest in accommodation their guests. It was like a challenge of how much money you had. Obnoxious and tired from its hayday. No spa or relaxation facilities. I would stay at the Four Seasons instead."
10,2030,"Oct 21 2009 	Clift continues to maintain its sublte culture and warmth.	As a return guest to Clift, I was pleased with the continued gracious service and friendliness of all the staff. Traveling with a French friend, she was amazed by the recognition she received daily, and often in French. We dined in Asia de Cuba and enjoyed a lovely meal with exceptional service. The simple chic decor of our room was comfortable, spacious, and sunny. Clift's location, near Union Square, provided easy access to theaters, shopping, Cable Cars, Museums, The Wharf, and so much more!! It was enjoyable to return to Clift each evening after experiencing a day in San Francisco. I am pleased that Clift continues to maintain its subtle culture and warmth."
11,2030,"Oct 18 2009 	I ALWAYS have a great experience here !!	I have stayed at Clift SO many times that I no longer bother to write an online review every time, but after seeing some negative titles popping up I felt I had to speak up and provide an alternate opinion. First of all, the reason I've stayed here so many times is that it is the ONLY place I will even consider in San Francisco. I am sure there are plenty of nice hotels in the city, but this one won my heart from my very first stay, over 6 years ago. The service was OUTSTANDING right from the beginning, even though at the time we were staying in the cheapest, online low budget room we could find. We were still treated like valued guests. The rooms were beautiful (Still are !) and clean. The sheets are luxurious, and anything you ask for ... you shall receive. It's not cheap but I feel that I get far more that I pay for !! The staff has NEVER been rude to me and I haven't seen them be rude to anyone else either - in fact, on the contrary, I have seen them turn the other cheek sometimes with haughty guests !! They are all fun, engaging, and with a great sense of humor.I love this hotel: the atmosphere, the location, the restaurant ... it's all wonderful. Don't be swayed by some negative reviews - I have always had a GREAT experience here."
12,2030,"Oct 16 2009 	Must do Something about the Unfriendly Attitude that Prevails!	From soup to nuts, this hotel need an attitude adjustment. It's just not fun here! While the lobby is pretty (and the room nice, but dismally and dimly lit), it's almost too self-conscious and trendy. What a shame! It could be a lovely place with the right management."
13,2030,"Oct 14 2009 	Big Attitude from staff and doorman - I don't recommend this hotel	It looks cool and modern but the staff is unbearably rude. I came in late with some friends and the doorman stopped me and asked to see my room card although he waved the friends through. I kindof hate this place and would never stay here again. They are overpriced and really stuckup. Not sure they really want anyones business, but they'll never get mine again. I also plan to complain to the organizers of our conference."
14,2030,"Oct 13 2009 	ask and you will recieve...	I read the reviews for the hotel and became concerned as I had already made my reservation. The front desk manager was away this particular weekend but David was quick to step in and understood my worries. During our stay it was clear that they had made adjustments to fix the poor reviews. The staff was friendly and engaging, the price was fair, the hotel was in good shape (we expect less-than-grandiose restrooms at restored buildings in large cities.), and when we did have an issue, it was quickly resolved to our satisfaction. I am very pleased with the way they kept my worries in mind...we had a great time."
15,2030,"Oct 12 2009 	Always great	I stay here at least 3 times a year, have stopped trying anywhere else in SF as this hotel treats us so well."
16,2030,"Oct 7 2009 	Nightclub not a hotel	The rooms in the Clift are reasonable sized, clean, and modern looking, and the beds are incredibly comfy. The location is briliant, and our rate was reasonable. However, there were 2 things that I really disliked about this hotel that make me reluctant to stay there again. 1) This hotel is not at all welcoming when you walk in. We arrived relatively late at night, to enter a very dark lobby (I think they would probably think of it as mood lighting) with incredibly loud music and what appeared to be a posh nightclub in the next room. I was initially concerned that we were at the wrong place. It was so dark it was hard to read the forms etc. for check in, and the music was unpleasantly loud. Despite the really nice, light corridors in the room section of this hotel, and the rooms themselves, I never really managed to shake the feeling that we were staying in a nightclub, and found the contrast between the lobby and the niceness of the rest of the hotel quite jarring. It also didn't help that despite being 2 floors above the club bit, we could still hear the beat of the music when we were trying to sleep.2) I have stayed in higher starred hotels (and more businessey) than this, and ones I have liked much better, but have never really felt so uncomfortable walking into a hotel wearing casual shorts and t-shirt as I did at the Clift. None of the staff were openly rude to us, but I got a distinct impression that they didn't really think we were the right sort of people to be there."
17,2030,"Oct 6 2009 	Shady low light modern 	This hotel was recommended by my company when I had to visit San Fran for a few days, I really enjoyed this stylish Hotel/ stroke hip bar. If you have been partying the night before Clift is ideal in the early mornings because of it's low light interior perfect for easing you to routine and blocking out that bright Californian sun. The room was spacious, thoughtfully equipped with stylish decor and a bathroom bonus of Korres Natural Products! Located next to museums and theatres and all the retail giants so plenty to do. The bar gets pretty busy with sophisticated types :) so it's the perfect scene for socialising and getting to know the city life, great experience."
18,2030,"Sep 29 2009 	Good...not great.	The hotel is nice and well-located, but falls short of standards set at other Morgans' hotels. While the lobby was well-done, the living floors of the building maintained the feel of a junky old apartment building. The room was fine (although bathroom only big enough for one person). The bar/lounge area had an odd vibe. That may just have been due to whatever conference was in town, but it did not match the style of the venue.Anyway, we were in/out...so the hotel worked very well for us. I just expected a bit more after visiting some of their other properties."
19,2030,"Sep 25 2009 	Very cool hotel in a great location	Stayed a couple of nights at the Clift following a business trip to the West Coast.Hotel is very contemporary with lots of coloured perspex, low level lighting with contrasting colours. Very chic. Check in was fine and for some unknown reason, they upgraded me to a Junior Suite - which was a welcome surprise. Room was excellent and very clean. Also, large by San Francisco standards, even if it was a suite. Nice toiletries and a shower that works properly! Great bed with loads of pillows and ultra fresh linen. Nice.WiFi was good but pricey at $14.95 for 24 hours. Highlight was a few beers in the famous Redroom bar on the ground floor. This place is a San Franciscan institution and where the aspring beautiful people meet for cocktails. Great buzz in the place as the evening wore on, if a little too crowded for my liking. The adjoining restaurant - Asia de Cuba - was very busy and apparently, is pretty hot in town at the moment. I didn't eat there but the menu looks very, very appetising. Will visit next time I'm in town. Location is ideal, just a couple of blocks from Union Square. Really enjoyed my stay here, even as a solo traveller on this trip. Not cheap. but as I said previously, contemporarily cool and a great place to watch the 'Beautiful People'. One word of caution, some of the staff can come across as a little too arrongant, but hey....no tip soon sorts that little problem out :)"
20,2030,"Sep 24 2009 	Top notch hotel great location rooms and service.	Typical of Morgan's hotels, there is nothing to complain about here. Great service from the moment you arrive until you leave, great design (modern, quiet and clean rooms). The Redwood Room bar should not be missed, and the Asia de Cuba restaurant is great as well. Located just off of Union Square in the theater district and convenient to BART."
21,2030,"Sep 24 2009	Unique hotel...great location	Great hotel if you're looking for something different, and you like boutique hotels."
22,2030,"Sep 23 2009 	Hip noisy unfriendly and packed	Stayed in this hotel as part of our honeymoon, did not enjoy it at all. Pleasing on the eye but very very dark during the day, no daylight. At night the bar fills up with locals, no where to sit down and have a quiet drink, a large amount of outside influence to this hotel. We found the room pleasent but extremely noisy. there was a baby staying across the corridor and we heard it crying the entire night, no sound proof in the walls what so ever. Good location, thats the only thing we enjoyed from our stay in the Clift. Won't be back."
23,2030,"Sep 21 2009 	Give this one a try - great all round hotel	We stayed for three days and booked via American Express.Rooms were great, bed and lien was super comfortable. Staff were knowledgeable and very helpful (unlike what some others have mentioned on TA).Quite close to Union Square and very easy walk to everywhere. As we were out of town when asking for a map they gave us discount vouchers to Macy's, Saks as well as a a few other stores.Have stayed before at the Westin, plus down near Fishermans Wharf - this is where I will be staying next time.The in house restaurant was great, but very very expensive, as was the bar. This place is cool, but unlike some of the other Morgans hotels this was no way near as uber cool as say some of the ones in Miami!"
24,2030,"Sep 20 2009 	Quite disappointing - not as great as other Morgans hotels	My husband and I have stayed in a couple of other Morgans Group hotels (St Martins Lane in London, and Delano in Miami) and were very excited about staying in the Clift. However, if you're looking for something similar to those other hotels, you will be slightly disappointed. The rooms just aren't as special. They feel quite old and worn for some reason, despite the modern decor. Our bathroom was really tiny, the selection of products was poor, and the overall 'feel' of the room was a bit dingy. The hotel is also missing a special social element. It does have a good restaurant and bar, but they are simply 'good' rather than great. They're both fairly small and strangely dark (even during the day). On the positive side, the hotel is in a great location - just two minutes from Union Square and all the main shopping streets."
25,2030,"Sep 14 2009 	What a Snotty Attitude	This place tries to be cool; the experience was definitely cold, and unless you are a gorgeous looking model or a rock star, don't expect any service.The first experience was at the front desk. My son had secured the reservation with a credit card. The receptionist insisted she had to have the card holder present; I offered a debit card and suggested she take the first night, and we could straighten it out when my son came. She turned her nose up and said she would have to take $900 out of the card for our three night stay up front. After I called my son, they said 'it would be alright, as long as he came later.&quot; Don't expect any friendliness, or the staff to point out amenities, or ask if you need a wake up call, or anything else. The public spaces including the reception and waiting areas are very dark in monochromatic dark red.The room was very chic with lots of mirrors to make it look larger, but so small that there was approx 18 inches between the bed and the wall; the hallway so dark we couldn't see our clothes in the closet, and there were no drawers. My son had negotiated a very low rate, so I cannot complain about the cost. My sister and her husband had a suite which was very nice, but cost three times as much.No amenities in the room such as coffee. They serve free coffee until 7:00 a.m. When we asked for coffee at 7:05 we were told the charge was $5 a cup. Use the Starbucks across the street."
26,2030,"Sep 12 2009 	Choose another hotel	We were disappointed with the Clift from the moment that we arrived. We found the door staff to be unwelcoming, reception to be understaffed and the communal areas a little seedy in appearance. Our room was fairly spacious and clean, although furniture and bathroom looked cheap. The leaking loo flusher added to the bathroom's failings. We were glad to leave after 3 nights to a far superior hotel."
27,2030,"Sep 8 2009 	Great vibe but maybe a little too club-ish! Tiny rooms......	We stayed at this hotel for a long Labor Day weekend. The decor in the lobby was fantastic and modern and the front desk staff was very helpful and super friendly. Checking in was a breeze!Our room was a superior king and for $200+ a night, we expected a little more than what we got. The room was small and the bathroom was incredibly tiny. You had to manouver around to get the bathroom door closed behind you. There were no drawers to put our clothes in, just two Ikea-type plastic boxes. The bed was the hardest I've ever slept on, and needless to say we didn't get much sleep each night. Room service - I'm still in shock over how expensive breakfast was one morning. Coffee for 2, OJ, 3 scrambled eggs, granola and yogart, and a breakfast burrito = $80.00. Not kidding. I'd highly recommend getting up and walking a block to a restaurant. We ate at the hotel restaurant, Asia De Cuba on Sunday night and the food/service was fantastic. Same menu as the one in New York. A bit too pricy for some people, but hey it's vacation! One thing we didn't know was that the lobby bar turns into a club on the weekends. It's apparently &quot;the place to be&quot; and is extremely crowded. We're by no means fuddy duddys and like to go out to clubs once in a while. But having a club where you sleep isn't the best scenario. Every time we tried to walk back into the hotel at the end of the night, we were stopped by the stereotypical LA/NYC rude doorman until he was convinced we weren't trying to sneak into the bar. I would not stay here again because it's not worth the money. And who wants to fight their way past a snotty doorman and a crowd of people to get to the too-small room with a very hard bed."
28,2030,"Sep 5 2009 	Calm and relaxing hotel with great design	I had a deluxe room on the 12th floor and found the accommodation to be excellent. My room was beautifully designed, large, comfortable and with a nice view. The bathrooms are pretty small but I dont spend too much time there and prefer to have more space in the room itself.I liked the closets with space to get all your stuff out of the room and maintain the clean design.I was a bit frustrated by the high charge for wifi but this practice is pretty much universal across all hotels that I've stayed in.... I guess no one forced me to use it.The staff were amiable and helpful when needed. I prefer the less is more style of service in hotels and dont like over attentive staff (this might be an English thing) but for me the staff found the right tone and the right level of service.I would definitely stay here again although its worth hunting around for a good rate on a deluxe room if possible."
29,2030,"Sep 4 2009 	So much style - but not in bathrooms and service	The rooms/suites of the clift, just as the lobby and the bar are state of the art STYLE.The bathrooms of the hotelrooms though are beyound motel standard - I mean it...All the service staff is extremly good looking, extremly bored and extremly far away from any 5 star hotel service.Still, especially if you travel on your own: the redwood bar is the place to be..locals register weeks upfront to be left in, all are around 25-45, attractive and extremly dressed-up, even on week days.Hotel Rates sometimes go up to 300$..check with your local travel agency - I usually never do that, but it turns out, the clift has very good rates with some travel agencies (in germany with TUI and Neckarman, we stayed in a suite for 180$, which is very decent.)"
30,2030,"Sep 1 2009	Fantastic hotel	We stayed at the Clift Hotel for 5 days and enjoyed every minute of it. Check in was quick and easy and the rooms are very spacious. The bathroom is a little small and outdated, but otherwise fine. The reception desk and the concierge were always friendly, though sometimes a bit slow in making reservations for restaurants etc. All in all I would definitely stay here again. The location is great as you can walk to the major attractions."
31,2030,"Aug 31 2009 	Bad customer service	We were happy with the hotel until we found out that our credit card had been charged for $340 for a mini bar we had apparently cleaned out. This was not the case since we never even opened the minibar during our stay which lasted only from 11PM to 8AM. When we went to speak with the manager, we were made to wait in the hall for a long time and when the manager finally spoke with us, he did so in front of a lobby full of people and in a manner that was rude and defensive. Finally, we got our money back, but I would definitely not stay there in the future nor recommend the hotel."
32,2030,"Aug 24 2009 	NEGATIVE NEGATIVE NEGATIVE	The hotel is old with just a fresh coat of paint...the walls are SUPER thin (lets just say we knew EVERYTHING the neighbors were doing..) plus we could hear the base from club downstairs until 2-3AM...the bathrooms are impossibly small and being 8 months pregnant did not make it any easier! The rooms are small and not impressive...oh, and our room filled with cig smoke at 8AM...we could not get out of there quick enough (we left at 9AM....) We got a deal from hotwire but if I had spent the $200-300 they wanted I would have been [--]..."
33,2030,"Aug 20 2009 	Great public spaces but average rooms	The other reports on here are fairly accurate. The public spaces, restaurant and redwood rooms are great fun, especially the moving portraits in the bar. The rooms just about adequate with very little character, and even littler bathrooms. Food was good in the asia de cuba restaurants, and the cocktails were delicious in the redwood rooms.Overall a decent city hotel"
34,2030,"Aug 17 2009 	An updated funky old hotel with very thin walls	My husband and I stayed at the Clift Hotel for the 4th of July. We were really excited about it because we were able to get a great rate through Expedia. The hotel is really interesting - very hip, funky decor, but it is very apparent that the bones of the hotel are really old. They have done a successful job of updating the look and feel of the rooms with minimalist decor, but certain elements - such as the bathrooms and the dark hallways that would look really depressing if they weren't painted lavender - date the building. The location - right by Union Square is perfect for exploring San Francisco. The best part of our stay was having such a fun bar in the hotel after returning from Hubert Keller's awesome restaurant, Flur de lys. The worst part - the walls of our room were VERY thin and our neighbors were having a very good time next door..."
35,2030,"Aug 16 2009 	not impressed	dark hotel is very much yesterday in my opinion.Crazy prices, homeless people seem to surround the hotel which can be daunting.We were evacuated from the hotel at 5am for a fire alarm. We were not told anything not even a note the following day at reception as to what had happened. Not good enough in my opinion.Not a 5 star hotel, surely better options. This whole dark image inside gets boring quite quickly as do the silly prices for basic items.."
36,2030,Aug 16 2009 	Good but not Great	Well located hip hotel with good rooms but not great bathrooms. Strangely there is no art on the walls and therefore rooms can feel quite sparse/cold. Be aware the hotel is big and therefore the customer service is not as good as it could be  no one helped with our baggage on both our stays and you feel like you are being processed through as opposed to being really looked after.
37,2030,"Aug 13 2009 	Beautifully appointed wonderfully staffed	This is a gorgeous hotel. The staff is excellent, with some of the nicest, courteous and most professional people that I have encountered in a long while. The decorations in my room were beautiful! Also, the lobby is out of this world, with an over sized chair and fireplace that are very fun and inviting. The hotel boasts a great club/lounge/restaurant that seems to have all the beautiful people in San Francisco grace it's doors.One quibble however. Housekeeping knocks on doors at 8 am. You can hear them in the hallway knocking away until they make it to your room. I had to request that they not knock before 10 am. But that is a small gripe for such a wonderful hotel."
38,2030,"Aug 11 2009 	Right in the center of the action	We stayed at the Clift for one night on a Travelzoo promotion - double upgrade to a suite for $145/night. We were pretty happy with the room, especially at that price, but if I paid $350 per night like they supposedly used to charge, I would be pretty unhappy. The room had absolutely no view, but we didn't really care. The lobby is very dark, so much so that it took awhile for our eyes to adjust before we could see anything. The staff was okay but we have certainly seen better service at other hotels. For example, our group of seven wanted a drink and there was no room at the bar - which is quite busy late at night, by the way - so we asked if we could buy drinks and drink them in a non-busy area of the lobby that had enough seating for our group. They wouldn't let us do it, and there was no explanation as to why we couldn't. Well, they lost out on about $150 for no good reason, which we ended up spending at the St. Francis down the street. Other than that little issue, we had a nice time and the hotel is centrally located close to theaters and restaurants."
39,2030,"Aug 10 2009 	Overpriced and Underpar	I must say, when I looked at the Clift's website I was excited about staying at this hotel...My husband and I are from the east coast and took a month vacation/business trip to the west coast. We are used to staying in the top rated hotels; San Francisco was our last stop after visiting Sedona AZ, Las Vegas, and Napa Valley.Upon arrival at the Clift, we waited almost 10 minutes for someone to valet our car, and while waiting we were approached by 3 homeless people. Once we got to our room, it was not what we had expected. The room was extremely small, just enought room for a bed and a very small desk; the bathroom was a nightmare, there was barely enough room for one person and I nearly broke my neck getting into the shower because they use some sort of shiner on the tub that makes it very slippery. As an avid traveler I often expect city hotel rooms to be on the smaller side but this room was ridiculous, there was barely room to put our luggage. However I will sazy that the room was very n icely decorated.The hotel was ridiculously expensive (I paid $6.50 for a soda at the bar). We paid $57 a day to park our car when we realized the day we left that theere was a parking garage 2 blocks aaway that charged $19 a day.Now I could have dealt with the small room and the overpriced food and drinks but the service waas among the worst service I have ever had in my life! The bellhop ran right into me with his giant cart, and cut open my ankle, and then HE looked at ME like I did something wrong (he never even apologized even after my husband said something to him). The &quot;doormen&quot; don't open the doors for you, they stand around outside chatting amongst themselves. Everyone was rude from the valet, to the front desk, to the waitstaff at their restaurant. The most polite people were the maid staff, even though we had to call down each day to have our room cleaned.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone... Other than its location, this hotel has nothing to offer; there are a lot of options in this city and The Clift would not be in my top 10 for first choices. Save yourself the money and dissapointment because you could probably find better service at a Holiday Inn."
40,2030,"Aug 9 2009	Do NOT even contemplate staying here	Complete rip off and over priced. The attitude is a very affected 'style over content' - but unfortunately the style is terribly dated, despite its claims to be avant garde (sorry Philippe Starck, this isn't one of your better examples). When enquiries are made to staff about the distinct lack of necessary items in rooms, they lazily cite the 'minimalist design' as the reason. At these prices, and when staying for the best part of a week, I don't think expecting to find furniture into which clothes can be stored is too much to ask.I've seen bigger bathrooms on airplanes. No mixer, so the entire duration of every shower was spent adjusting the ever-changing water temperature.House keeping was inconsistent and unattentive.This is was the worst kind of hotel stay - I spent lots of money and did not get the value of it in return."
41,2030,"Aug 7 2009 	I would be very annoyed if I had paid more	We stayed ar rhis hotel to take advantage of a travelzoo promotion that gave us a deluxe king room for $145. The corner room we had was attractive, in a self-concious post-modernistic way, but it was very noisy. I cannot understand why it apparently did not occur to the interior designer that hotel guests might like to have furniture that included drawers or at least a closet with reasonably-sized shelves and perhaps might need a place in the bathroom to put things. What really annoyed me, however, was the list of items in the room that were for sale at ridiculous prices, including $3 for a sewing kit of the sort that is distributed for free at many low end hotels/motels and $150 for a shower robe that was comparable to ones they have at CostCo for $30. And let's not forget the liter of water for $11. If there is a similar deal available on my next trip to San Francisco, I would consider returning to the Clift for the location, but would prefer to stay elsewhere."
42,2030,"Aug 6 2009 	OK Hotel the rooms are extremely loud....	Stayed for a night in late June. Had an amzing rate through hotwire so booked it. The lobby and bar and lounge are really warm and cozy. The best part of the hotel. The service was fine, most of the employees were young and it seemed that they were new hires trying hard but learning the ropes. The rooms were plain white, the lighting was fair at best, walls paper thin. We could hear our next door neighbors convo at they were not speaking loudly. The bathrooms were tiny, toiletries were missing and one towel in the bathroom. The beds were very comfy and the sheets were of high thread count. Hard to believe this hotel was charging plus $350 a year or 2 ago. The hotel was next to empty and I would imagine the economy played a huge factor in that. The place just felt a little off and had this cold and dark feeling. Not what I expected."
43,2030,"Aug 4 2009 	One of the best hotel I have ever stayed in!	Wow! Our trip started out great. We had an early arrival and checked-in around 10 am. The lady at the reception desk was friendly and enjoyable. We got a great rate on the room $145/night with a double-upgrade). Our room was ready when we arrived and once we walked into our room we were so impressed. We had a corner suite with a huge room, nice vanity sitting area and nice bathroom. As with the older, more historic hotels the bathrooms are usually small. Our bathroom was a decent size (nothing to complain about). We utilized the concierge on a few occasions - restaurant reservations and for tour ideas. They were phenomenal! Great service, great suggestions and we got a wonderful table at Ozumo. We were able to get a table overlooking the bay for the same evening they made our reservations (the restaurant was packed). We cannot stop raving about our stay at Clift and the spectacular service we received when staying there. We would not have a problem paying full price for our next trip out there (oops, maybe I shouldn't say that). The convenience of having a car service at our disposal 24/7 was much appreciated and well utilized. I cannot stop raving about our trip out to San Francisco and the Clift Hotel had a big part in making this such a phenominal trip!"
44,2030,"Aug 1 2009 	The Clift is a level above all the rest in every aspect and cannot be missed if you want to feel like royalty.	Check in to check out, the Clift provided a feeling hospitality and a level of service rarely experienced. Our stay was as enjoyable as we've ever experienced. David, Stacey, Scott and Dan Lewis were extraordinary. The concierge services were outstanding, food and beverage likewise followed (dinner and breakfasts at their restaruant Asia de Cuba,) and where else does a bellman (Scott) remember and address you by name? We'll return and when in Miami or SF our choice will be a Morgan property. Again, our thanks for a great four days!"
45,2030,"Jul 31 2009 	Jaw-Droppingly Amazing	There really are no words to express how amazing my stay at The Clift was. Upon deciding to take a last-minute trip to San Francisco, I priced a variety of hotels looking for the best option. I have stayed at a number of different hotels in the greater Union Square area, usually switching off between The Clift, Westin St. Francis, Westin Market Street, or W. I've always been a fan of The Clift, and admire the tasteful decor, and how it truly is a very boutique property (very unique design, yet still functional and fun). Upon checking rates, I found a great price via Hotels.com for The Clift, and decided to book it for two nights.I took the BART into San Francisco from the East Bay, and walked the short distance from the Powell Street station to The Clift hotel. The area is wonderful; located just off of Union Square (roughly two blocks), you pass some interesting art galleries, restaurants, and shops. There are some delicious restaurants within walking distance, and a very conveniently located Walgreens and Starbucks within about 100 meters of the hotel. Check-in was fast and easy; the nice girl at the counter recognized me as a guest who had been to the hotel before, and inquired how things (job, for example), was going. I very much enjoyed the personal touch. The girl kindly upgraded me to a larger room, and asked if I would need any assistance with my luggage.My room was beautiful! Amazing bed (truly one of the most comfortable, more-so than the W's Heavenly Bed), and a very functional workspace. The room was spacious by any standards, especially San Francisco standards, and for two-three people, I never found it cramped in any way. The room included a nicely stocked mini-bar with snacks (not obscenely overpriced, though the Walgreens across the street made it nice to go for a short walk and pick up bottles of water and snacks and not pay hotel prices. Like just about every San Francisco hotel, wireless internet was available for a fee, but I had no hesitations about paying when needing to do work. Overall, i found the room to be very comfortable for sleeping, working, and entertaining, though the property was inviting and made me want to explore common areas.While I did not dine at the Asia De Cuba restaurant for dinner, my brother and I took advantage of visiting the Redwood Room for dessert. The bar/lounge was packed for a Sunday night, and upon asking the hostess for a table, she checked to verify we were guests, and asked us to wait a moment. WIthin a minute, she had asked two patrons to vacate the table they were using, put a reserved sign on it, and had us sit down. A very nice touch, as it's wonderful to know guests of the property are treated like VIPs within their own hotel. Neither of us drink alcohol, but we ordered some iced tea, water, a snack, and dessert. We had a fun time chatting with the hostess and people-watching, and the food was delicious. The bill was very reasonable, and even after leaving around midnight, the lounge was still packed with people coming in.The next morning, we opted to eat in the hotel at the Asia De Cuba restaurant. There was a nice buffet setup, and the waiter was very prompt and precise. The restaurant was not entirely crowded (it was roughly around 10:00am), and even for the late breakfast hour, there were still plenty of choices available. We walked around the property and enjoyed making use of the fitness center (VERY tasteful and functional, especially for free), as well as the little nooks the lobby has to offer. Other things of interest were the kind and helpful concierge, who might as well have been a robot; he knew answers to questions that most people would have to Google (what time random art galleries open and close, quickest routes to places), and the hotel offers a very prompt and elegant car service for $15 (we took the car to North Beach).Overall, The Clift is certainly a great property for just about any occasion. I would opt to stay here over anywhere else, including the W (not very personalized service) or much more expensive places like the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton (maybe it's just my taste, but I find them INCREDIBLY overpriced for what they offer). The greatest touch The Clift offered was the kind staff; everyone was welcoming and wanted to engage in conversation. I truly feel as if I made friends at the property, and felt nice when my name was remembered, even to people I had only met briefly.I highly recommend this property for any occasion (business, leisure, romantic getaway, or just a nice night out), and truly do not see how anyone could be disappointed."
46,2030,"Jul 27 2009 	Very Cool Hotel but Not Luxurious	I have been a regular visitor to the bar and restaurant at this hotel for many years, back when I used to live in the Bay Area. Recently I booked a 1 year anniversary trip with my wife and decided to stay here. We had some sort of large suite that was very spacious, but very sparse. The bed was not exceedingly comfortable, but wasn't bad either. The rooms are edgy but cold. The bathroom was huge but felt like a hospital and had a serious issue with the water from the shower ending up in the hallway.The lobby is fantastic and the Redwood Room Bar and Asia De Cuba restaurant are some of the cooler spots in the entire city. We returned nightly to long lines of people waiting to get past the ropes into the bar, but the staff remembered us by sight and let us through quickly with a pleasant hello. Most staff remembered our names even though we were only here for 4 days. The staff were as good as any Four Seasons or Peninsula. Surprisingly the incredibly loud bar scene of the lobby did not make it to our room on the 5th floor. Street noise, however, had no problem at all getting into our room at all times and woke us up every morning. The location is excellent.Ultimately the hotel will guarantee a pleasant and exciting stay- but not a quiet and luxurious one. Like most Ian Schrager properties (hotel owner) the aim is for a Cool, Hip, Edgy feeling, not pampering. The staff are great though- no edge at all just awesome service. We knew what we were getting into and liked it. Probably would have been more appropriate for another type of trip, rather than a 1 year anniversayr because &quot;romantic&quot; doesn't come to mind- but we had a great time anyway.No spa onsite. We went to the Ritz for that."
47,2030,"Jul 21 2009 	The good the bad and the ugly.	We chose The Clift because it looked fun and unique from it's web site. It is unique in decor with some hits and some misses. Modern and funky, but honestly it just felt like we were sleeping in a nightclub. The bar downstairs is very popular, but unfortunately not my scene. If you are in your 20-30's, VERY SINGLE, and hoping to score you would like this place. They have some serious house music playing all night on Fridays and Saturdays, but to their credit it wasn't too noisy in my room on the sixth floor. I could still hear it, but it wasn't terrible. Room- modern decor. Lots of mirrors to try and make the room appear larger. The bed basically took up the whole room. The bed was awesome and I slept like a baby. Big plus. The big minus was that my husband and I had to take turns walking around the room cause navigating around the bed was a bit of a challenge. Another big minus was that the shower did not drain properly. Called the front desk within the first hour upon checking in. They immediately sent someone to look at it. After a draino job later, it worked a bit better but still drained very slowly and I pretty much always had an inch of water in the tub while I showered.Service- the staff were all lovely and very attentive. No complaints there at all.Location- pretty good as far as daylight was concerned. Lots of stuff right around the hotel. Walgreens, bagel shop, cute diners, easy walk into Union Sq. At night, it gets a bit sketchy. Lots of homeless people in that particular area, as well as lots of people looking to party. Do not walk around that area at night alone. I live in Boston, and also lived in NYC, and I was definitely a little worried after 11pm hit. Dining Tips: We are foodies and went to many great restaurants while we were there visiting friends. Check out Town Hall for good Southern inspired cuisine. So yummy! The bbq shrimp app was AMAZING. We all wanted to lick the plate. Brenda's is an awesome little French/Cajun place that serves up one of the best breakfasts I've ever feasted on. Apparently it is next to impossible to get in on a weekend brunch, so I recommend going for bfast during a workday morning. Only maybe 10 tables in the whole place. Really fantastic food. Do not miss out on trying the beignet flight! They are like donuts and filled with goodness. I will be craving them for weeks to come!"
48,2030,"Jul 16 2009 	Like kids again	We dropped our two children off with grandma &amp; grandpa, then headed for a weekend getaway in our own city. We checked into the Clift, and were promptly taken care of. The studio room was excellent. We enjoyed the well decorated lobbies, and the Redwood Room was a load of fun. The location of the hotel was great. Close to the Fillmore theatre, where the Mighty Mighty Bosstones played. Walked from the Hotel throughout Union Square, China town, North Beach, Fisherman's wharf &amp; back. Loved it."
49,2030,"Jul 15 2009 	Excellent Staff	We are two older couples that booked the Clift Hotel for the Friends and Family Rate. After reading the reviews, we expected a trendy, dark, noisy, small room boutique hotel. We did find a dark, trendy, boutique hotel with a great location and an excellent, friendly, helpful staff. The room was small but it is a downtown hotel in an older building. Our biggest complaint was having no where to unpack our clothes. We lived out of our suitcases for five nights. The bathroom was adequate with hangers on the door for our toiletries and a couple of shelves above the commode. The bed and comforter were luxurious. We were not bothered by any street or hallway noise. The gym was outstanding. We are not into the bar scene but did go in the lounge on Sunday night for a drink $$$$. Service was excellent and our server was very friendly. The desk staff, door staff, and concierge were most helpful. I can't praise them enough."
50,2030,"Jul 14 2009 	Fun hotel great bar friendly/attentive staff	I booked a last minute stay and got a great rate. I was able to upgrade upon checking in to a quite large room. This hotel has a great location, excellent restaurant and a can't-be-missed bar. Though one of the trendier hotels in SF, all of the staff I dealt with were extremely friendly and helpful (unlike at other trendy hotels). The only downside is a smallish (though nicely furnished) bathroom which is part of the &quot;charm&quot; of a vintage property."
51,2030,"Jul 9 2009 	Awesome Centrally Located Beautiful People Great Concierge	I'm 43 yrs old and visited the Clift SF from NYC on July 4th weekend with my girlfriend. To give context for our preferences, we typically hang in the East Village and Lower East Side in Manhattan, and enjoy drinks and appetizers rather than heavy meals that make you feel fat and tired. The Clift was excellent. Clift is a &quot;cool&quot; (some would say trendy) luxury hotel where many good-looking people hang. The hotel is dimly lighted. Some reviews did not like that, but it did not bother me at all (akin to Paramount or Royalton in NYC). Clift is downtown and centrally located. Clift staff suggested not renting a car for the entire stay - I agree. We walked the entire city over the weekend and then rented a car from the Clift on Monday returning it at SFO after driving to Napa and the Cliff Hotel on the Pacific. We stayed in the Deluxe King at $215 per night - an excellent rate for a spacious clean room with a nice view. Elevators were fast, room was clean, service was excellent. Stock your refrig with goods from Walgreens across the street. Uncrowded Starbucks also across the street. Staff was friendly helpful, not overbearing. I recommend you call the concierge and tell them exactly what you want to see - they are very knowledgeable and will direct you to the best places. Don't get too caught up with maps and guides, just call the concierge. Be specific. If you want to see something &quot;funky&quot; don't be embarrassed just say what you want and the concierge will get you there. We did and had a blast. Our weekend was basically walking around everywhere (Pacific Heights, North Beach, Castro, Mission, Filmore Street, Haight Ashbury etc.) laughing all the way, and tasting cool foods and many drinks - a martini at the Top of the Mark Hotel and a double Mojito in Sausalito (by ferry) were particularly hilarious. I'd skip Fisherman's Wharf (akin to NYC Southstreet seaport and China Town (&quot;the original&quot; but seems the same in every city I visit), unless you are into that sort of thing. We enjoyed Napa but the ride is a bit long and honestly we preferred checking out the city sites and people. This may be shallow, but wineries all seem the same to me. Check our Muir Woods if you like HUGE trees.If you have 5% of the good time I had, you will be extremely satisfied. Good luck."
52,2030,"Jul 7 2009 	Excellent location view and amenities	The Clift combines a sweeping view, a prime location and a unique charm that makes it a winner.Just two blocks off Union Square, this property manages to meld Old World high-end seclusion with modern chic sensibilities. Colored-mirrored elevators combine with stalely redwood-paneled lobby decor for a decadent, yet playful effect.The rooms are spacious and bright, with grand views of the city. Enormous mirrors and firm beds made the room a pleasure. Windows open to allow the city's breeze to cool you into a deep, relaxing sleep.The amenities are endless, from concierge services to an extremely well-stocked minibar.This is a hotel for the person who enjoys luxury, but enjoys it with a modern twist."
53,2030,Jul 4 2009 	An Alright Hotel	An overall very nice hotel. Very modern feel on the inside and the old world charm of a heritage building on the outside. Close to all the major shopping and theatres. My only complaint is the the windows and walls didn't do much for sound. You could here everything outside and in the hallways while in your room. But if you looking for a nice place to stay in the heart of San Fran I would recommend this hotel.
54,2030,"Jul 2 2009 	Beware...What a dissappointment	We had reservations for 4 nights and we checked out at 6:15 am following the first nights stay. If you require more than 2 hours sleep per night this hotel is not for you. Beds were extremely uncomfortable, a brick platform would have been a improvement. The rooms windows are not insulated and the street noise was constant. I now realize why the Hotel web photos only show the bathroom sink. The sink takes up a fourth of the total bathroom sq. footage. Hotel does not have a ice machine and charges for internet connection. Upon check-out and after I had expressed my discontent, the clerk informed me that there would be a $50.00 early departure fee. After a brief discussion the fee was waived. The location of the hotel is accommodating. Strongly recommend staying elsewhere."
55,2030,"Jul 1 2009 	Fabulously cool and serene place to enjoy a HOT town!	Partner and I stayed at Clift for Gay Pride. We also helped set up host a Hospitality Suite for our organization. Lobby and first floor area very stylish, mood is peaceful and calming which we appreciated given our hectic schedule. Service was AMAZING, fast and helpful. Partner is disabled and the staff went out of their way at every turn to meet her needs. Everyone was fun and friendly; Eric Shangle made our group feel very welcome! and location was a nice walking distance from Pride events. Even spotted a few celebrities in the hotel! LOVED IT!"
56,2030,"Jun 30 2009 	Absolutely fantastic!	Knights Out spent Pride Weekend with the Clift Hotel. We rented several rooms and the hospitality suite. We found the rooms to be spacious, tastefully decorated, and comfortable. The service was impeccable. We hosted a gathering of approximately 40 people in our hospitality suite and the staff of the Clift went above and beyond to tend to our needs and make the party a fabulous success! Thank you, Clift Hotel, for a wonderful experience and a fantastic weekend!"
57,2030,Jun 29 2009	Best travel experience i've had in a long time	Everyone at this hotel was simply amazing throughout the entire weekend at meeting our needs and ensuring we were well taken care of. Eric Shangle was our contact and helped us set everything up and was there for us throughout the weekend if we needed anything and helped us tie up some loose ends even after we left the hotel on Monday. I will definitely stay at the Clift when I go back to San Francisco.
58,2030,"Jun 25 2009 	Can a hotel be any darker?	The Clift Hotel was announced as one with a special design interior. And this was the case. Any daylight was taken out of the lobby, the bar, the restaurant etc...The first floor has the feel of a dungeon. Not what we were looking for if you come to discover San Francisco for a couple of days.Upon arrival the first thing I noticed is that there wasn't any form of roof or arching under which our cab could drop us of. It was raining and we had to get ourselves through the pooring rain with our luggage into the building. We were greeted correctly and after check -in we had to carry our luggage to our room ourselves.The rooms are small with a bathroom that isn't worth mentioning. Way too small and everything is dated.The good thing is that all this made us spend more time out in the streets of Frisco. We had no reason or incentive to stay inside the hotel any longer than required. A shame for a higher priced hotel which tries to sell itself as something special."
59,2030,"Jun 23 2009 	Completely outstanding experience	from the moment we pulled up to the front door, the clift and its staff impressed my fiancee' and me...the bellman, smartly dressed, took complete care of us and our car and made sure to know our names and greeted us personally as we would leave and return... the concierge team of erica, jenny and david got our restaurant reservations, made great suggestions and even got us unlost while driving around... the redwood room bar is amazing and the bar staff makes some wonderful cocktails... it is racous at nite, but you just need to know what kind of entertainment you want to experience...we stayed in a junior king bed suite, which was more than roomy enough (as we had read about smallish rooms) and was a great value with a fun view of the city... if there was one disappointment, it was the fact that a wedding in san jose meannt we could not stay sunday nite as well and instead needed to check out and leave this wonderful and well-located, old world charm meets new world charm hotel...we will be back and hopefully soon... thanks guys (and girls)!!!"
60,2030,Jun 23 2009 	Not a luxurious place to stay	My husband and I celebrated our 31 anniversary at the Clift. The location was great but that was the only thing we liked about the hotel. The lobby and bar were very nice but the rooms were very small and not comfortable. There was no place to sit and read and the lighting was very bad. The bathroom was most disappointing. It was very small with absolutely no vanity area. There was no place to put your toiletry products while trying to get dressed. I would not stay here or recommend this hotel to my friends or family. It was most disappointing.
61,2030,Jun 22 2009 	Great service but...	We had a great time at the Clift.. The people were very friendly and helpful.. The walls could be a llittle thicker. The only problem we had was we used hotwire to book our trip and at checkin we used our debit card to put on the room. We were then informed that they would hold $150 per day we stayed. They put a hold on $1050 for the whole time wew were there. It would have been nice to know that was coming before we got there.
62,2030,Jun 16 2009 	It was Great!	I had a great stay at the Clift in May 2009. The staff is gracious and very helpful. The room was large and private. Have stayed here numerous times and it is always a fun time!
63,2030,"Jun 15 2009 	Worth the two trips around the block!!	I adored this little hotel. Although, my girlfriends and I joked about the hotel sign being in braille! We circled the block twice looking for it, and there it was--the tiny little CLIFT sign; hiding in plain site. The two Justin's out front were very nice, the checkin gal very helpful and the general vibe inside the whole place felt uber cool. Loved the funky chairs and eclectic decor. Never met an unfriendly hotel worker our entire stay. But we are friendly folks too!!We had a room on the 7th floor, far away from street noices, and as long as you didn't look down (unless you like looking at HVACs) it wasn't bad. I liked being able to open the widow for a bit of cool night air. The room was big enough for three small town girls to get ready to be fancy girls for a night at the theater. After walking to the Daily Grill for a great Happy Hour menu, we had plenty of time and room to get ready for Wicked, the play. After the play, we just knew we had to finish our big night off in the Redwood Room. Fun place to people watch!! Conversations are difficult, however. The music is a bit loud. Never thought I'd get old enough to hear myself say that!!Meanwhile, up stairs, we found beds that were comfortable enough. There is a Starbucks across the street, and in the morning, it's an easy trip over and back for coffee and scones in the room. The location is safe, and within walking distance to Union Square, Market Street, cable cars and lots and lots of fun shopping and eating and exploring. Oh the SHOPPING!!I would stay here again, I would recommend it to my friends, and except for the pricey drinks in the Redwood Room and $50 valet parking, I have no complaints. But, hey, it's San Francisco!! We may not like it, but we have come to expect it! You only live once!After many, many, many stays in this crazy city, The Clift stands out in my mind as one of the most unsual, eclectic, but clean and comfortable places I've been. Would be interested to know if there is a &quot;park and shop&quot; special.Pros: Safe location, close to many attractions, clean, cool, quiet and eclectic. The staff we encountered were all nice. Good price thru Hotwire.Cons: Not really &quot;cons&quot; so much as comments: Parking is expensive (It's like that everywhere in SF) The hotel sign is hard to see, you really have to look for it, which is not easy to do when you're driving in SF. Hint: It's on the left side of the street, and located almost at the corner. Not much of a view from our room, but we weren't there for the &quot;view.&quot;"
64,2030,"Jun 9 2009 	It was a truly memorable experience I will definitely stay there again and will recommend it to my family and friends.	A colleague of mine recommended that I stay at the Clift when I was in San Francisco last week. Well I did and I have to say, everything was perfect.I worked in the hotel industry for 9 years and I know how much work goes into creating a memorable guest experience. It was truly memorable, I will definitely stay there again and will absolutely recommend it to family and friends."
65,2030,"Jun 8 2009 	great location interesting decor friendly staff.	Stayed at the Ciff for a two night get away from Chicago. Very attentive staff, always there to open a door or ask if they could be of assistance. The location was very comvient for my weekend of meeting friends for drinks and dinner. I would recomend this hotel to anyone. The Redwood bar was fantastic!"
66,2030,"Jun 8 2009 	worth it	Fantastic location at Union Square. Few minutes walk from Maceys - open-top-bus tour departs from outside Maceys. Excellent diner for breakfast/lunch across the street - &quot;Davids&quot;. Staff very helpful and friendly. Always taxis outside the door. Room very clean, bathrooms small bit dated but you dont mind for the location and they are clean. Only problem was the water temperature in the shower kept changing and the water pressure changed too. Probably during peak showering times in the morning as the evenings were ok. Definitely recommend it. Very trendy."
67,2030,"Jun 5 2009 	Worth a look but not a stay	Funny one - we arrive for our 3 day stay on a Saturday morning and were asked if we could move &quot;next door&quot; to the Marriott because they were full. In return we would be upgraded to a suite for the remaining 2 nights. We agreed and then were left to lug our baggage to a cab (which we had to pay for!) to get to the Marriott which was about 2 streets away. When we returned the next day, the room wasn't ready until 3pm. We went out and came back about 6pm, rang through for our bags which took 50 minutes to arrive !! The ipod dock and the TV didn't work and whilst the room was big (with a dinner table set for 8!) the bathroom was small, old and tired (maybe 6ft by 6ft). I dread to think what bathrooms are like in standard rooms! Very disappointing. The hotel decor is very different and its fun and worth a visit to sit on the big chair and see the dark coloured mirrored lifts. Its very trendy and for that reason the staff feel they are a bit above you. I wouldn't rush to stay there again to be honest after the experience of the Bellagio in Vegas, Beverly Wilshire in LA, on the same trip this was the worst :("
68,2030,Jun 5 2009 	DBL Suite - very spacious!!	The staff at the Clift Hotel is excellent  always courteous and accommodating! That and the spacious suite made our visit very memorable. The Redwood Room provides an excellent atmosphere to socialize in a classy environment and the overall location of the hotel is amazing  only a few blocks from the best shopping in San Fran!
69,2030,"Jun 3 2009 	Wonderful Place to Stay!	My friends and I had one of the suites and a double room. The suite was huge with plenty of room to get comfortable in. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The concierge made all of our reservations for us and helped us navigate this huge city. The hotel was located only a couple of blocks from one of the major shopping areas and was just a block from the trolley stop. It was a great location, if you are wanting to experience all parts of San Fran! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone heading to California."
70,2030,"Jun 2 2009 	Loved it Loved it Loved it!!!	This hotel is absolutely beautiful! We took a &quot;girls trip&quot; and all agreed the accomadations were wonderful. The Clift has an amazing bar and restaurant as well as incredible rooms. The rooms were well done and the staff was quick to meet all of our needs. We had never been to San Francisco and found them very accomadating in setting up our dinners/ entertainment. Overall, I highly reccommend this hotel for both it's convenience, hospitality, and funky/fun decor!"
71,2030,"Jun 1 2009 	amazing...again	this was our second stay at the clift, and we now consider it our home in SF. the place is so cool, the people have always been so great to us. we travelled this time as a family and they gave us a great room that we were really comfortable in. the service staff are amazing, they come when requested, with what you want, they even went across the road to buy stuff that we wanted and they didn't have ( that only a teenage has the cheek to ask for). the bar is the best, the staff there are so onto it, the atmosphere is great, and we have had some great nights there. we were there at christmas and i couldn't think of a better place away from home to be....all in all, we love the Clift!"
72,2030,"May 21 2009 	The Best in Union Square	I just came back from a 6 night stay in SF. I stayed at the Clift Hotel and I must say I am completely delighted. Everyone was nice, the doormen were always there to open the doors, give suggestions as to places to go, etc. I read reviews saying this place was full of rude people and I must say I do not agree. I did not encounter one rude person in this hotel nor in SF!! The Redwood Bar was awesome, drinks are pricey, but I'm from Miami where that is the normal price, so I wasn't surprised. I loved the whole atmosphere with the hotel, so chic, so trendy. I also read about the rooms being small and I will disagree again, not at all small. I got the standard room with two double beds and there was plenty of space. Who cares that there is no drawers, who really unpacks their stuff while on vacay. If things like that bother you, then I can see why this hotel is not to your liking. I didn't get a chance to eat at Asia de Cuba but I have eaten at the Miami location and it is excellent food! Location wise, this is the best place to be, so close to so many diff places and all within walking distance. Westfield Mall is a huge mall about 5 blocks away. Macy's, Saks and all the fine boutiques are also nearby. There's a Walgreens across the street as a well a Starbucks and a deli (david's deli). I would gladly go back to this hotel."
73,2030,"May 19 2009 	great place to enjoy SF	Had a chance to stay at the Clift recently, hotel was amazing with a great view of downtown SF. The staff was great, everyone from the valet to the front-desk were extremely helpful and made me feel very much at home."
74,2030,"May 18 2009 	Awesome Hotel!	I enjoyed an incredible stay at Clift while in SF for 1-night on business. The room was great, bed was comfortable and service was fast and attentive. I also had the fortunate experience of dining at Asia de Cuba for an amazing wine event. Overall stay was excellent and would highly recommend."
75,2030,"May 14 2009 	Funky Modern Contempory hotel	This hotel was a very funky and modern hotel, which we loved staying in.....We got to the hotel and was greeted by the gentlemen on the door which was opened for us every time we went in and out of the hotel which was fabWe checked in quick and the reception staff was very friendly and always happy to help, the reception area was funky too with the big chair.We stayed in a superior king room on floor 6, the room was really modern and funky again and very spacious and was everything which we loved.... and had a big flat screen, massive bed and a nice sized bathroom, big closet and a fridge and snack which was a bit pricey and so was the room service menu but i am sure the food would have been great We stayed here 4 nights and we was so happy staying here..eveything was so close by....We also tried the bar on the Saturday night which was busy and was really nice to go too. We only had a few cocktails which was nice.i would recommend this hotel highly........its a very good hotel for somebody who is looking for a modern contempory hotel centrally located...."
76,2030,"May 10 2009 	yep tendance but to know before: tendance doesn't mean the perfection	Honestly: a good hotel. but not a 5 stars, a 4 stars....in summary.The location is perfect: nothing to sayThe room: i had a good price with an other website: on website of the hotel the price are not affordable. But be sure, you will be not positively surprised: a loft is a junior suite: nice for a big town but small for the meaning of the words. I knew too the basic room: definitely too small.The decor: hip...but not so &quot;up to date&quot; (the same that 4or 5 years ago). rooms: carpet clean yes but with a few stains. insufficient light, bathroom: first sight : you think yes, but when you look:nothing special. In overall i was satisfy but maybe i expected more that a simple clean and big room. Ambiance cool for the decor.The desk: not constant. A few are really helpfull, a few are not a the right place: the customer is you and not their. In other words: the hip attitude is for the customer not for the staff. The information are sometimes ok, sometimes false: your impression is that the sttff answer quickly to go to other thing. lack of professionalism,....An other point, when the price are so expensive, it's a shame to have to pay everything in supplement: water in the room, if you ask to put the transfert on your bill,....In summary: the hotel is good but don't expect too much, poor quality/price (except a real promotion),The hotel si hip, yes but no more and on the way of the hip for russian traveller, fortunate teenager...with all the side effects.If you know that, you will feel perfect, if you are expecting more that an image....take your decision"
77,2030,"May 1 2009 	Loved the Clift Hotel	My partner and I travel often so we have definitely seen the good, the bad and the ugly as far as hotels are concerned and I must say that the Clift exceeded our expectations. From the moment we arrived we were treated with warmth and kindness by every staff member we encountered. All of the guys working at the hotel are not only friendly but also easy on the eyes! We loved the decor of lobby and our room and I must say that the Red Room Bar was really swanky, sure a martini is $15.00 but hey, you only live once! This was our first time to San Francisco and definitely will not be the last. The hotel itself is close to everything and anything you would possibly want to do in this city, public transportation is just steps away and cabs are abundant. We did all the tourist stuff, went to Castro, Chinatown and Alcatraz but the highlight of our trip was the Sunday T-Dance called Fresh at Ruby Skyee which is once a month and conveniently enough located right around the corner from the Clift, if you want to party with the boys this is the place to go! We loved the Clift and will definitely be back."
78,2030,"Apr 30 2009 	Trendy but lame	I was only at the Clift for a night with my husband and we like fun, trendy hotels but I must say, this hotel is NOT worth it! We booked a larger room on hotels.com and I would hate to see what the smaller, less expensive room would have looked like. This room was TINY, we had a view of a building wall and the guy at the front desk that checked us in was a total cheeseball who thought he was really important. I asked him if we had a nice room, trying to make conversation and he responded with some sarcastic, rude comment. Not to mention to park your car here is $50 a night, plus tax of $7. I know San Francisco is expensive but I think $57 to park overnight is slightly absurd. We had dinner reservations at the restaurant in the hotel, Asia De Cuba, which I will say was fantastic, the Redwood Room bar is cool too, we had a drink there before dinner. Barely got a seat at 7:00pm. We went to some other places after dinner and went back to the Redwood Room and it was totally packed and if we wanted to sit then we would have to order a bottle of vodka. Um, no thanks. I like modern hotels, but this was done in poor taste, looked cheap, the bed was horrifically uncomfortable and the entire hotel is dark. Don't stay here, its not worth it."
79,2030,"Apr 26 2009 	Beautiful hotel in downtown San Fran	Loved this hotel from the moment we arrived. The staff are extremely friendly and loved the design of the rooms, lobby and lounge (Redwood Room). The hotel is really close to Union Square. Can't wait to go back."
80,2030,"Apr 17 2009 	One Night at the Clift	A few freinds and I were staying at a friends house outside of San Francisco for Easter Break and we decided last minute to spend a night in San Francisco and the first hotel we could book was the clift, There were 6 of us in the room, which was abnormally large, but college students with meagre ration have little choice. The clift is ideally located for a fun filled night out in gay San Francisco"
81,2030,"Apr 7 2009 	Perfection at it's best	Love this hotel. Love the decor, the staff, the food, the location. We've stayed at three different places in SF whenever we go, and this is always our favorite. The music is soothing, the staff attentive, the room spacious and clean. SF at it's best."
82,2030,"Apr 7 2009 	the difference between good and 'outstanding'	we arrived late with the dreaded news that our room had been inadvertantly double-booked and with an apology and a promise of true compensation, we were chauferred off to the nearby Hilton for the night. The next day upon early check in, the hotel manager himself came to greet and personally escort us to our 'upgrade' - a 3-room luxury suite accompanied by chilled champagne, flowers, a letter of apology , free drinks voucher in their incredible Redwood bar and free breakfasts for the duration of our stay. For the next four days we were treated like royalty in one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in. The Asia de Cuba restaurant is superb, the Redwood Bar an experience and our whole stay perfectly memorable. What a difference a great hotel manager can make. Thank you Steven - we will be back!"
83,2030,"Apr 1 2009 	Exceeded my Expectations!	I first stayed here in Nov 05' and came back this time for a quick business trip. The Clift was the only place I wanted to stay b/c of the wonderful experience I had last time. The location was ideal and it has the best lounge in town - Redwood Room.The reviews threw me off a bit as well..but I'm glad that they were WRONG. Contacted the hotel mgr (steven) expressing my concerns, and he responded right away to assure me that I would have a wonderful experience..and he was right! You are greeted at the door w/ handsome gentlemen who open the door for you &amp; will walk you across the street in the rain (Justin). Then you are greeted by a wonderful front office staff who remember your name each time you walk by and smile and always ask if I needed anything. I was traveling by myself, and felt completely safe and content w/ this hotel and staff. The mgr (Matthew) went out of his way to walk me to the Redwood Room, introduce me to the bar staff (Jacqui) who then continued to WOW me w/ their service. Jacqui is full of great ideas to fill up your day...I was more interested in shopping...and she pointed out the best boutiques in the city. She became my go to person each evening I was there for friendly conversation and great cucumber cocktails. So if you consider yourself trendy or chic, like the best of the best, The Clift is the place you want to stay and play. I'll definitely be back for another visit."
84,2030,"Mar 28 2009 	Exactly what you'd expect- stylish and fun	I've read the bad reviews about the Clift, but my husband and I thought it was well-done and actually quite friendly. The staff was happy to chill our champagne, take special care of our luggage, make restaurant reservations for us, set up a special spot in the Redwood Room... really, we were met with smiling faces and competent service on all ends. I thought the design was beautiful even now. And of course- the Redwood Room is worth the spendy drinks!"
85,2030,"Mar 24 2009 	Great big chair and great big scallops	We visited a couple of times late last year while we were in SF. Cool bar, great drinks, big serves.....but LOVED the chair at the front......can you tell......?? Well worth a visit."
86,2030,"Mar 20 2009 	Funky fun and I was lucky and got it cheap	An old hotel revamped into a trendy nightspot. Take a torch to find your way to the lift! Upstairs the rooms are large and light. Great location next door to the ACT. I was lucky and got it through Hotwire for $90 a night. At that price it was a bargain, the rack rate less so. Pity as always about the internet charge"
87,2030,"Feb 28 2009 	Redroom bar... awesome... !!!	Have stayed at Clift for the weekend with my friend, two girls (27-28 y.o) coming for a short weekend in SFO and looking for a luxury ( but not boring) hotel with a good location to explore the city and some entertainment later in the evening in the hotel bar... We could not have found a better place! Were totally satisfied. I must say we did not even want to go anywhere else and spent most of the evenings there... Thanks to the Redroom... Clift is known for its very welldesigned lobby and the Redroom. A stunning, elegant lounge with beautiful digital paintings, an enormous, luminous bar, and intricate, chic redwood paneling and a nice crowd.... The Redwood Room is one of the most luxurious night spots in San Francisco. Get quite crowded in the evening. Great place, nice crowd, we loved it ! Have been checking other hotels for a drink / dinner while staying in SFO and were very happy that Clift was the choise... See many people are saying the staff was rude, was not the case with us. Everybody was friendly and very helpful... To put it short if you are single and looking for the hotel with the nice bar to hang out in the evening ( together with the good locations, service etc ), this is the place. I would not dare to recommend it though for the families with the kids. Depends on what you are looking for. We were extemely happy and satisfied... And have a had a great weekend. Thank you, CLIFT ! ;-)"
88,2030,Feb 28 2009 	JOKE!! So Overpriced! For What!!!	I stayed here in december with my husband and two small children and were so happy that we were only staying one night!The hotel charges you for everything!! They charge you $7.00 for a small bottle of water and $14.00 fo the large! Yup that's right!My children watched a couple of tv shows which we were charge $5.00 to watch! Just normal disney channel shows not movies!From the moment you arrive at the hotel you feel like you are getting fleeced! I will never stay here again or be advising anyone else I know to stay here!The last time We were in sanfracisco we stayed at the four seasons which was great! i only wish we stayed there this timeDon't go to the clift!!!!!
89,2030,"Feb 18 2009 	Good service spacious room	We stayed at the Clift for 3 nights recently after finding an amazing rate on Expedia ($163/night). The location is very good--just a few minutes walk from Union Square. The staff was friendly and helpful at every turn. When checking in my boyfriend asked if they could give us a complimentary upgrade if rooms were available and they gave us a junior suite. This was great given that the weather was terrible during our stay and we ended up spending more time than usual in our room. The living area of the suite was comfortable with plenty of seating, a television, and a desk. The sleeping area was small but perfectly adequate with a comfortable king-sized bed. There is also a TV in the sleeping area. The one space that needs real improvement is the bathroom. When the hotel was renovated they did a cheap &quot;cover-up&quot; job on the bathrooms. Ours was very small, with hardly enough room to open the door without hitting the toilet. The door was also coming off its hinge and didn't close properly. The tub was small and had been refinished (badly) and had chips in it. On the positive side, the shower (while the head is a bit low on the wall for a tall person) literally GUSHES water, which I love. Towels were plentiful and luxurious, and the provided bath products were very nice.The hotel charges $15/day for internet access from your own laptop, which is absurd. The business center charges $6.95 per 15 minutes of internet use and nearly $1 for each printed page. On the plus side, the business center DOES offer free boarding pass printing if you want to check in for your flights online. Also, there are no ice machines so if you want ice in your room you have to call room service, wait for them to bring up a bucket of ice, and tip the person who brings it to you. Why can't they just have an ice machine like almost every other hotel I have ever stayed in? Having said that, if you go to the bar and ask the bartender for a couple of glasses of ice to take to your room they are provided cheerfully. Overall, I would certainly stay here again if another good rate was offered."
90,2030,"Feb 16 2009 	Very Chic Modern 	My wife and I stayed at the clift for valentines weekend. This hotel is very modern looking. From the moment we checked in to the moment we check out, we had great customer service. We were always treated like VIPs. Our room was the standard King room. The room while being a little small, worked out great. Our bed was amazing and the decor made the room comforatable and refined. (bathroom was tiny....only one of us could be in there at a time). The room had huge mirrors that made the room seem bigger. The Redwood Room at the Clift is a great lounge/bar. The only draw back is the only way to get a table is if you get bottle service. Hotel location was close to Union Square and cable cars.I would not recommend this hotel for older couples...the hippness might be lost on them."
91,2030,"Feb 7 2009 	refined pretention	The room was quiet, the famous Redwood Room filled with a self-congratulatory business set of 25-45 year-olds. I came away feeling the clientele might be more dreary than the hotel itself which really does make a solid effort to look snazzy, upscale, and ready to please."
92,2030,"Feb 4 2009 	Attitude - just forget it!	Staff were unfriendly and arrogant. Decor was fine for the common areas (e.g.reception and bars) - Stark! - but really ugly rooms. We paid $80 for 2 very basic breakfast so please stear away from the breakfast room - there are plenty of diners around where you can have a very nice breakfast. Overall not worth. However, location is excellent and rooms are quite big."
93,2030,"Jan 25 2009 	Not great rude staff	First impression was wow!! The lobby is nice with oversized furniture. The room then, what a let down. Everything you would expect from a nice hotel was available in the room but the only difference was that everything had a price attached. A ridiculous high price for any of the small extras that come complimentary in any other hotel."
94,2030,"Jan 24 2009	Artfully Elegant	Style. PrivacyWe live across the bay and wanted a weekend in the city. .I knew the Clift only for the lobby and the adjacent bar. Well designed ---(worth taking your sketch book, designers) and private. Now I can say that the rooms are also well designed, sizable, spare, and comfortable. Fully delivered. Expensive-- but one pays for this quality, particularly in the city. Feels like the old world private club for the well healed and hip. I am neither of these but it is fun to play at it."
95,2030,"Jan 7 2009 	OMG - These People Have No Concept of Customer Service	If you're looking for the worst customer service imaginable, then the CLIFT is for you. They do the bare minimum at best on everything starting with the reservations desk. These employees really hate their jobs and could care less. Want Grief? Stay Here!!!"
96,2030,"Jan 5 2009 	Location Location Location	Having read some of the reviews of The Clift, I went fearing the worst. But I have stayed at Morgan Group hotels before and know they tend to be above average. We booked a great rate the week before from Expedia UK and went for a Superior Room - not the worst and not the best. On check in (for 4 nights) I was told I could upgrade if I wanted to for $100 total, but we were really happy with the room - the bed is great, the shower amazing, and the use of large windows and two huge mirrors made it seem very light and large. The room feels individual - beautiful furniture and lights, and all mod cons are there. Staff were great: friendly and very responsive. Cannot fault them. Yes, the decor is a little pretentious, and if you don't want to pay $18 for a martini in a dark room, cross the street to The Owl Tree for a drink or three. The location cannot be bettered - you can walk out to anywhere and while you're never escape the sirens in this part of town, the height of the hotel offers commanding views of the city. This was my third visit to San Fran, a City I love to bits, and The Clift was a great place to stay (when we normally go independent and boutique). The decor of the hotel is a little more show-off LA, but the attitude of the staff is much more down to earth. Also - we had a great meal at a new restaurant called Gitane -- opened by an Italian serving Spanish influenced food - worth seeking out on Claude, with an excellent wine list."
97,2030,"Dec 13 2008	Underwhelming; No Reason To Stay Here Again	Stayed at the Clift Hotel for an onsite wedding. Two night stay.Overall, a pretty underwhelming experience. As expected, the room and bathroom were small. Bathroom had very little countertop space and the shower pressure was uneven. The room had limited space beyond the king sized bed. The modern design just felt dated. Bed was comfortable though. Below average number of TV channels. Noise was a problem. We could hear music from our room both nights. Also, didn't like having to present our key to get in to the hotel itself at night. The bar was packed - we wanted to hang out there, but decided to skip it. BTW - we did get a couple free cocktail coupons at check-in.In summary, a pretty dated hotel that fails to be hip. I wouldn't stay here again unless I had to. Prefer the St. Regis or Four Seasons for sure."
98,2030,"Dec 2 2008	Fine Hotel for the Price	This hotel is in a great location near Union Square. The staff was very helpful and kind. The rooms were quite small but we didn't spend much time there anyway. The lobby &amp; the hallways are very dark which make it somewhat uninviting.You can walk to many great restaurants, shows &amp; other attractions which is very nice.Don't know if I will go back, but overall the stay was nice."
99,2030,"Dec 1 2008 	Great choice when discounted rates available	We just love the Morgans Hotel Group and stayed at many of its other hotels before. So, when we decided to go to SF for an extended weekend we knew we would try the Clift. The hotel is kind of hip, in downtown just some steps away from Union Square. Lobby, bar (try the cucumber cooler!) and the interior in general are stylish as expected. Rooms tend to be very small so we booked a superior room via hotels.com at a very competitive rate, almost half the price the Clift asked for online. Thus, the room was roomier but the bathroom was still a joke; you can hardly sit on the toilet without squeezing yourself between wall and sink. Anyway, room was clead and quiet. The restaurant Asia de Cuba is excellent, the waiter recommended just to order 3 appetizers for my wife and me and he was right: way enough for a 'regular' hunger at a resonable fare. And not only cheaper but also hipper than the Le Colonial where we ate the other night. We would come back to the Clift."
100,2030,"Nov 19 2008 	Great Location but small rooms	Great location, very central. Staff were nice but quite pretentious. Room was small - bathroom tiny and the worst facilities we experienced on the west coast relative to price i.e. tiny TV, shower etc. Definitely a place to be seen so I'm sure it's a hit with locals..."
101,2030,"Nov 10 2008 	Chic and Trendy	A very chic operation in a great location. I found all the staff to be extremely cheery and helpful and experienced none of the snootiness mentioned in earlier reviews. The bar seems to be the destination for a fashionable San Francisco crowd but don't let that put you off.The rooms are quite minimalist but in a good way and all of the furnishings are clearly of a very high quality. The one downside - quite the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in my life. Our Time Out Guide had told us to prepare us for that, but even then I didn't think it would be quite as small as it was. Having said that, I would stay here again, so it wasn't a deal breaker."
102,2030,"Nov 9 2008 	Nice on the surface - but everything than professional or reliable	Being a Guest @ the Clift of San Francisco gives you great first impression - nice and stylish lobby with sofas made from /decorated with ivory teeth (Is that being allowed to be imported into the U.S.?).The room consits of cool designed interiors with added mirros - infinity style - so dont stay in there too long you my get dizzy ;-)They Serve Breakfast - dishes start @ around 25$ - the lame Continental Buffet is @ 30$ way to expensive - way tooooooo!Room Service is alway plus a lot of additional charges - not just the Tip.Valet Parking!!!Its a unbelivable 65,-- US$ per Night.Valet Parking is lame - I have waited a couple of times more than 30 Minutes for my ride.Restaurant and Bar are nice - lots of shiny people hanging out there - but as experienced - just get rid of their &quot;overdose&quot; in the lobby - honestly - we came back from a nice dinner and two guys were vomiting over the whole &quot;nice&quot; lobby - my wife will never go to the Clift again.Go there for a drink, Party or Dinner but never think of staying there to enjoy San Francisco or a business trip.Btw. Business - Internet access is 14,50$ thats fair - but the bandwith is maybe 28.8 Modem Century - absolutely unacceptable.Staff is friendly - but that only helps a bit - we celebrated my birthday - and expected a little message by the management - but nothing appeared.Sorry for this review - but be warned - we will never choose them again - there are way better options - like the &quot;W&quot; and other nice Places.S.F. Nov. 9th 2008"
103,2030,Nov 3 2008 	Modern 	I loved this hotel! I had read some of the bad reviews left and was a little scared staying here. On our arrival we where treated like royalty! We where given the room we wanted and we had asked for a room on the top floors. The Clift is modern and the atmosphere is incredible. The location also outstanding!I will never stay anywhere else in San Francisco!
104,2030,Oct 27 2008 	Fancy Schmancy	This was a really fun place to stay in San Francisco. I found a fantastic rate on Hotwire for this hotel. The hotel's interior is gorgeous with much attention to detail. The bar was quite fun and the location is unbeatable. I would definitely stay here again.
105,2030,"Oct 19 2008 	I loved this place!	The Clift was one of my favorite hotels. It's a modern boutique hotel, without any attitude. Our room was clean and comfortable, the hotel has a great fitness center, and there's also a restaurant and bar in the hotel. We hung out at the bar a couple times and it was a great place to grab a drink or dessert. The hotel is in a central area, a few blocks from Union Square, which was great for us because we love to walk everywhere. I found it was a 15-25 minute walk to most neighborhoods from the hotel. The only minus was there wasn't a coffee maker in the room &amp; the bed wasn't the most comfortable, but it wouldn't hold me back from staying there again."
106,2030,"Oct 8 2008 	Not Impressed At All	Beside the kinda cool lobby, this hotel was pretty bad. The rooms were tiny, old looking and worst of all the walls were VERY THIN. You could hear every door in the hallway open and close and could hear everything going on in the room next door. Absolutely nothing about this hotel was comfortable. Would never stay here again."
107,2030,"Oct 6 2008 	Chic Hip Trendy .... 	The Clift is a great hotel is you are looking for a boutique, non-traditional, luxury hotel in San Francisco. Its located a block away from Union Square &amp; within walking distance from many restaurants.The place has an overall chic modern vibe to it which hits you the minute you step into the lobby - a cool/hip bar, promising restaurant (we didn't eat there) &amp; excellent service.On the flip side, the rooms are ok - very clean, above average fittings/bed, no real complaints - we got a room without a view which felt dark, however they probably have better rooms."
108,2030,"Sep 28 2008 	Clift Equals Elegance with Personal Service	Clift Hotel truly knows how to provide luxurious comfort, superior service, and a &quot;How may I serve you?&quot; attitude!As seasoned, world-wide traverlers (business and pleasure), my wife and I were tremendioulsy impressed with the facility, people, and service. Our 5-night stay at Clift made our San Francisco vacation a most memorable time.The room was exceptionally clean and perfect in ambiance.The restaurant food was simply delicious (no need to eat out).The doormen always greeted us with courtesy and by name.The concierge provided service beyond belief.The front desk personnel were most friendly and helpful (they even knew our name before we arrived to check-in).Will we return to Clift Hotel? Count on it! We will stay no other place in San Francisco. Mr. and Mrs. R.L. Shangle"
109,2030,"Sep 26 2008 	Great decor - worst service in a long time	Our first time in San Fran and a great city. We went there with high expectations, being from London and often using Morgan Group Hotels such as the Sanderson. First impressions were good, very chic reception, although very dark it was pretty cool. Quick check in and straight to our room, which was well apointed, simple but stylish. The only downside was the bathroom that was tired and very small compared to the room size.As we had just arrived we thought we would try Asia De Cuba the restuarant (we know it well in London) and knew the food was good. We booked it with the conceige desk in the hotel. When we turned up at the restuarant they didnt have our booking and were very rude. When questioning the conciege we were asked ' Did you take the name of the person YOU spoke to?' Does one really need to do that?! We were seated 30 minutes later and were generally disgruntelled and decided to just have a starter and go to bed, when we were told we were not allowed to cancel our order and ended up having a [--] fight with a very surly waiter... a absolute discrace to be spoken to the way he did to us, totally unacceptable. It was a horrible experience and a bad start to our holiday. Other negatives included us taking photographs in the bar, where i was told that wasnt allowed and asked &quot;Are you staying in the hotel sir?&quot; reading between the lines making our like he could through us out. Overall, would be great if they traded staff with the four seasons instead of a bunch of &quot;Your lucky we let you stay&quot; snobs. The only blessing was that the bill is arragantly delivered to your room on the morning of check out so no need to go and speak to those losers again!"
110,2030,"Sep 16 2008	Loved the Clift Hotel!	We just returned from San Francisco having spent 6 wonderful days at the Clift Hotel The service was outstanding and we could not believe how helpful and pleasant all the staff were. There were always a couple of gentlemen greeting us at the door as we entered and left and they always had a cheery word for us. Check-in was fast and efficient and we felt special from the moment we arrived. We had a lovely, quiet, room which was very clean. The duvet and pillows were a crisp, fresh white and with the sunny exposure, the room looked very inviting, One evenning I was not feeling well and was in the elevator on my way to the lobby, when one of the staff saw me and offered to get room service to bring me up a &quot;warm cup of tea&quot; , or if I preferred, he would bring me tea in the lounge if I wanted to sit quietly. Now that's service for you!!The lobby was funky as were the elevators in dark mirrored shades of emerald green, purple and red. We loved the Clift and would defintely stay there again. Oddly enough, we had read some not very flattering reviews of this hotel before we went and I must admit we were quite concerened. However, we were thrilled with the service we received and the location of the hotel is perfect. Only a couple of blocks to Union Square and convenient to get anywhere in the city. Kudos to the Management and staff of the Clift Hotel. You've done a fine job."
111,2030,"Sep 1 2008 	Wonderful!	My husband and I stayed at this hotel over Labor Day Weekend, I was very happy with the accomodations, even though the bathrooms are tiny! The rooms were very clean, the staff were friendly, helpful, and really seemed happy to be there. We didn't spend alot of time in the hotel and did eat here at all so I cannot review that part of the accomodations. It was a little noisy, but seriously you are in the heart of a huge city, somethings can't be helped. One thing to add, 8 hours after leaving this hotel my husband discovered he had left his brand new laptop in the room. Needless to say he was very upset. I called back to the Clift and was put on the line with the security office. Not only were they nice, but they assured me the computer was in their hands and that it would be shipped to my home ASAP. I was amazed at the honesty and believe that The Clift should be very proud of their staff!"
112,2030,"Aug 28 2008 	Hicups	Upon arrival at 8 pm the confirmed type of rooms was not available. The lady at the receiption promissed to move us the next day around noon. At 1 pm the promissed rooms were &quot;about to be ready&quot;, at 2 pm &quot;only the mini bars have to be checked and you can switch rooms&quot; and at 2:30pm &quot;Sorry, the rooms were given to other guests by mistake&quot;. 3:00 pm: &quot;You can move in 30 minutes&quot;. 4:00pm: &quot;You can move every second&quot;. 4:30 pm &quot;Ooops&quot;. Finally at 5 pm we received much bigger rooms than originally booked: Super huge suites!Same with some other services - It is like the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing: If you have your laundry picked up for cleaning service, they will return your laundry the same day, but not give you a new laundry bag. No big deal if they wouldn't charge you 35 bucks for the missing laundry upon departure. Or the mini bar: When you arrive, everything is great. You drink a bottle of wine the first night, they will remove the used wine glasses the next morning, but never give you new glasses. About the bar area: The bar is really nice and fun and fully packed with young local people on the weekends. All seats are &quot;reserved&quot;, but there is no way you can reserve a seat in advance (even for hotel guests), unless you order a bottle of Vodka or better for 140 USD.They offer you seating in the lobby, which is very windy, if not stormy. Whenever someone opens the the main door of the hotel a tremendous wind blows right into the lobby.Besides all these little hicups, the Clift is a fancy and nicely designed hotel for a reasonable price. The rooms are clean, designed by Starck and Schrager and the staff tries to be helpful. If you want better services you may want to chose the Ritz Carlton or Mandarin Oriental, where you pay about 50% more.Not recommended for families: The restaurant does not have any kids menu!Try to get a room to the back: The street in front of the hotel is very noisy!!!"
113,2030,"Aug 26 2008 	eccentric...	This is a very eccentric hotel. I expected this from the pictures, but the feel within the hotel gave it all a different spin. I'd recommend this place to young people ready to party...PROS:- Great location, 2 blocks from Union Square- Hip/Trendy lobby and lounge- Friendly and welcoming staff- Adequate room (in a jr. studio)CONS:- thin walls; we could hear (and smell) what was going on in the hallways, including the giggling girls hanging out and smoking in the hallway before their night out- cleanliness could be improved. The bathroom had a few broken fixtures (toilet paper was falling off the stand) and there were black marks all over the white walls and floors- small bathroom (with the feel of a very loud public toilet)- cheap furniture. The decor looked sleek from afar, but up close, it looked cheap and it was uncomfortable on top of that (especially the bed). If you're looking for luxury or comfort, this is not for you.- dark ambience. The feel in the lounge was one thing, but the green/red/purple colors in the elevator made it a difficult adjustment on the eyes when transitioning from the light outside- quality of food. Asia de Cuba is an average place to eat. Both NY and SF have the same menu to offer, but execution in SF was off, making this a below average experience. We ordered straight off of the menu with no changes, and still 2 of our orders were incorrect (chicken in lieu of short ribs, and donuts instead of carrot cake?). One of the plates had a completely burnt item on it. The only thing this restaurant has to offer above the NY location is the restaurant atmosphere. The vibe is much hipper, and the music piped in from the Redwood Room is pretty good..."
114,2030,"Aug 23 2008	I loved the Clift	We just got back from a trip to San Fran and stayed at the Clift. I have never written a review about a hotel, but we had such a fantastic stay at the Clift that I felt I had to share it. This is a wonderful hotel. The staff bends over backwards to assist you in everything! I never had to open a door once. When I requested something sent to my room, it arrived quickly. It is quiet, roomy, clean and the sheets and beds are the best I have slept on. Great place! And reasonably priced for the city."
115,2030,"Aug 20 2008 	A lot of room for improvement at Clift...	My friend and I stayed at the Clift hotel in early August 2008 for 4 nights, and were quite disappointed given the cost of the hotel. Upon arrival, there was repeated confusion about our resrevation and we were informed that the Clift cannot honor room information from Expedia (which made us wonder why they accept reservations from Expedia in the first place)After the room debacle was settled, we had to switch rooms on our second day after we had been kept up most of the night by a baby in the neighboring room and the paper thin walls provided no buffer. The hotel is very focussed on being a &quot;scene&quot; in San Francisco, but unfortunately this comes at the cost of service to customers. Upon entering the hotel on Friday night, the doorman asked if we were hotel guests or going to the bar, we answered that we were hotel guests, to which he stepped aside and let us open the door by ourselves...not the service you expect for a $350/night hotel.Overall, for the price, I would certainly suggest that there are far better deals in San Francisco...the walls are thin, the room furnishings while chic appear cheap, the service is so-so, and overall, the hotel has a lot of work to get to international high standards.The Asia de Cuba restaurant is outstanding."
116,2030,"Aug 18 2008 	A Hip Atmosphere in an Old Building	Although the Clift Hotel recently underwent renovations which include new carpeting and paint, the builiding itself is rather old. The rooms were clean, the staff polite, the location central and the prices fairly reasonable for downtown San Francisco. All in all, I enjoyed my stay with them, but wouldn't give this hotel more than a 3 to 3.5 star rating. One unique thing is that the hallways are very ample and wide, but I believe this has contributed negatively to the bathrooms--as they are quite tiny.One thing to note is that the restaurant &amp; bar in this hotel attract a very hip, urban crowd almost every night of the week and on the weekend. This causes the hotel to become a bit noisy, particularly if you are staying on the first floor. On the upside, the food in the restaurant is good &amp; the bar has a very fun atmosphere, so if you are looking for a little excitement, you can find it right in the lobby!"
117,2030,"Jul 31 2008 	Pleasantly surprised	Got a great rate from Hotwire and stayed at the Clift for 3 nights. Staff was friendly and always smiling. My wife and I traveled with our 2 year old toddler and we felt very comfortable in the room. Room size was small for a four star hotel and also the bathroom. But everything was clean and housekeeping is very courteous and helpful. Ipod dock in room was a nice touch as I left my charger back home. Don't expect too much from the room. It has a king size bed, comfortable sheets and comforter. The table in the room is a little small, television seems like it was bought from a surplus shop back in the early 90s but DVD player was appreciated. (movie rentals are available for about 12 bucks a night it would make more sense to buy a DVD disc at Borders or Virgin which are both a few blocks away.) There was also a serious lack of storage space in the room.Bathroom was tight. I mean real tight.Noise from the street is real bad. Once of the drawbacks of being in the city, I guess.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Clift and would stay there again if given a competitive rate. Location was perfect for a weekend of just lounging and shopping."
118,2030,"Jul 22 2008 	Worst hotel experience to my memory	Upon checking in, our room (610) smelled so strongly of cigarette smoke my fiancee had an allergic reaction and did not sleep all night. We spoke with John, the manager on duty, and he could not fix the problem - according to him, the hotel was completely sold out, and we might be able to be moved to another room the next day. The bathroom was tiny, as was the room - far below our expectations for a hotel at this price point. Also, the bathroom was poorly maintained - the caulking around the tile was loose and moldy, the shower head was so intense we could not take a shower without extreme discomfort from the pressure of the water. Furthermore, the iPod dock was not functioning.The following morning, we requested and received a larger room (1225). This room was larger, and more up to our standards. It smelled of stale cigarette smoke, but not as horribly as our previous room. There were cigarette burns in the carpet, even though this room was non smoking. We felt as is there were no rooms that did not smell like smoke, and so we settled on that room.After being in 1225 one night, we received notice that we were checking out that day under our door, even though we were due to check out the next day. I had to return to the front desk and resolve that problem.During our stay, the wait staff in the restaurant was extremely inattentive and aloof. The service we received there was the worst restaurant service we have ever received. Overall, the staff was pleasant, though not very friendly, did not remember us, and was not very welcoming. My fiancee and I will not stay ever again at the Clift, and we would advise you to do the same."
119,2030,"Jul 21 2008 	Only if it's on the company.	Stayed here on business. The lobby is incredibly comfortable, which is in stark contrast to the rooms, which are coldly minimalist. And, I know it's a cliche, but the walls are truly paper thin. I could clearly hear the guy next door talking on the phone - almost word-for-word. Asia de Cuba's (the restaurant) prices almost caused me to have a seizure. But, on a positive note, the front desk staff was very gracious and helpful even though they were stressed from being sold out for 4 days straight. And, the location is very good."
120,2030,"Jul 20 2008 	Funky Quiet and a great location	We booked through TravelZoo and got a super deal for three nights, about half price of their regular rate! We were aware of the poor staff reviews, but were pleasantly surprised; everyone was extremely helpful and friendly, always ready with a smile and greeting. And we were not dressed to match the decor and feel  runners and jeans. I was surprised at the mix of guests  Europeans, families, business travelers and yuppies - not all stylin urbanites.I was surprised at the size of their room, after visiting the teeny tiny rooms of their Hudson! It was nicely done up, quiet, comfy linens and pillows and great light blocking drapes. To be picky - carpet had some stains, TV was very small (but rarely had it on), and breakfast buffet was weak if it we didnt have vouchers would have felt quite ripped off!Overall really enjoyed the funky lobby, all the different seating areas, the location was great (a few blocks from the trolleys and BART), service was great and price was right! Would absolutely stay here next time."
121,2030,"Jul 16 2008 	Lost my reservation / staff was not apologetic	So here's a case of a hotel that thinks it is too cool to have to worry about customer service. I booked a two night stay specifically so that I could come in off the redeye (from Japan) and check into my room early. I do ths often, so I know my travel agency (AmEx) is good at making sure that this will work. So I get to the front desk, and I am informed that I was deemed a &quot;no-show&quot; from the first night. I was charged the full room rate. And then I am told my reservation was therefore canceled and that they are sold out for my second night.... wow, major surprise. of course, I can't believe what I am hearingAfter some conversation, out comes the manager, who says that, actually, they do have rooms for the night, but at a rate 60% higher than what was on my reservation. He actually, with a straight face, indicates he is more than happy to accommodate me at this higher rate. *choke* *gag* I cannot imagine a more outrageous thing. They resold my room, and then want to charge me a higher rate.Here's the &quot;happy&quot; ending. AmEx gets on the line with the hotel - this is good - they have a recording of the conversation where AmEx specifically notified them I would be arriving early in the morning. Of course, they now have to honor my room rate.What's the worst part? Not even an &quot;I'm sorry&quot; from the manager. Got a free breakfast from one of the front desk staff."
122,2030,"Jul 15 2008 	Hip Fun and Great Service	I stayed at the Clift for five nights, and I recommend this hotel if you are looking for a hip, sometimes loud, and fun place to stay in San Francisco. The hotel is a few blocks from Union Square.I liken the Clift to a higher-end W hotel. Cool decor, young staff who are eager to help (much more so than the Ws I have stayed), great food and drink, and a terrific night scene in the Rosewood Room (bar/ultra lounge).I strongly recommend a suite. The standard room is too small if there is more than one person in the room. I would not classify the Clift as an excellent value, but I will stay here again.All the employees, especially the concierges, did their very best to make me and my party happy. No complaints at all with the service.Spent two nights in the Rosewood Room. This lounge is on par with most Vegas ultra lounges."
123,2030,"Jul 14 2008 	Clift Hotel--Roach Hotel??	I just returned from the worst hotel experience of my life. I had booked through hotels.com and requested a 2 double bed suite. When we got there, they said that they did not have our room for us, but they did have a king size bed. That was not going to work for the 5 of us. They then took an hour trying to figure out what they could do for us, at 12 in the morning tired from traveling all day. They finally said they had to down grade our room to a regular room with 2 double beds. When we got to our room, there was a frikking cockroach the size of my thumb running around. I captured it under the trashcan and put a water bottle on top to hold it in. The maid never cleaned it and charged us 15 for the water. ( maybe they didn't see it??) The room itself was ok, but the tv is about a 27 inch tube tv. So tiny for the size of the room, although we weren't really there for tv. The next morning we went to the restaurant for breakfast and the prices were ridiculous. 20 dollars for a waffle, 5 dollars for coffee, 7 dollars for Oj, and 35 for a buffet so crappy its like a buffet you would get at any other hotel for free. Our waiter never got us coffee refills, even though we asked him 3 times. Breakfast for 5 people cost about 200 dollars. Then in the evening, we went to the ridiculously pretentious bar. They made me take off my bachlorette party gear because &quot;They have a dress code&quot;. We then sat down got our drinks and asked them to take our picture. The waitress basically said no to us so a guy (in a visor, shorts and a t-shirt ----what dress code???) took our picture. The waitress never came back to check on us or ask us if we wanted any more drinks or anything. We left without leaving a tip. Now, I will say after all this, we were comped very well. After the downgrade, they gave us a 200 some dollar refund, 160 for breakfast, and the free round of drinks in the evening. When they found out about the cockroach, they comped us the 2 nights of parking there (115 dollars). The comps sort of made up for the bad stay, but I would never recommend anyone ever stay there."
124,2030,"Jul 14 2008 	Still a very good place to stay	I really like this hotel. Stayed for 4 nights in late June, booked a deluxe room and was upgraded to a very nice and spacious studio king. Yes, the bathrooms badly let the rooms down, but overall I think this is a very good choice for a central, mid-priced, stylish hotel which has a clubby vibe. Staff were all exeptionally friendly. On a previous stay there were problems with sound-proofing, but none this time. I'd recommend you ask for a quiet room, either at the end of a corridor, or on a corner. I'd definitely stay here again."
125,2030,Jul 13 2008 	Slick	The Clift is a very cool hotel in the heart of San Francisco. Everything is designed to be cool including the staff. People are friendly and helpful but beware unless you are from the beautiful tree you might not feel completely welcome.They also like to charge you for everything including internet access and bottled water which really annoys as the room price is high.Great bar and a really expensive but good restaurant.We liked it but would probably stay somewhere a bit more chilled next time such as Haight Ashbury.
126,2030,"Jul 7 2008 	Great location subpar service and amenities	My boyfriend and I decided to stay there on a last minute whim over the holiday weekend (3 nights). I was very excited from the website and the trendy photos but realized that when we got there it was more show than substance. A lot of attention was paid to an incredibly modern decor but not as much to friendly service or amenities. I would agree that some of the staff can be less than enthused by your questions or can seem pretentious, but overall, they were very helpful. The concierge was definitely able to suggest some nice spots to grab a drink or a bite. The rooms are definitely small and the tv is definitely tiny, but this was to be expected after reading the other comments on this website. We didn't mind that as much because all we wanted was a comfortable bed and a place to keep our stuff while we explored the city. Pros: Location, location, location, decor like that of a modern piece of art, comortable bed, nice bath products and robes, ipod dockCons: General lack of lighting in the common areas, small rooms, unenthusiastic service (overall). The staff seemed to stand around to be seen more than to be of service or helpful."
127,2030,"Jul 6 2008 	Sadly all of these bad reviews are correct.	We ended up at the Clift because there were a lot of events going on in San Francisco the weekend we went, and every where else was booked. We hated it. The furniture in the rooms is really cheesy and cheap. Our friends' room was supposed to be an &quot;upgraded&quot; room, and when they saw our room, they realized that not only was their room smaller, but the bed was even smaller (a queen instead of a king). After a lot of complaining at the front desk they finally got a different room, and it was fine, but I wouldn't have called it upgraded. Our friends also got gift certificates for the restaurant there, and when we went to use them we were told that there was no way they could get us in, they were completely booked. After a little more complaining at the front desk, they did let us in, but it turns out we would have been better off had they just turned us away. Everything is extremely expensive, so I thought it would also be extremely good, and it WAS NOT. It was so bad, I had a couple bites of each thing and left hungry. It wasn't just marginal, I could not eat it. My friends and I sat wondering if we just ordered the wrong things, or if everything on the menu was that bad. Breakfast there is good though, not fantastic, but good. The service is not great, the whole place is kind of snooty and cold. For the price of the Clift, I would expect much, much more. When I read the bad reviews before we left I was still optimistic, thinking it couldn't possibly be that bad. I was extremely disappointed to discover that the bad reviews were right on."
128,2030,"Jul 5 2008 	Great hotel but not for everyone	The Clift is a wonderful hotel, but as the reviews reveal, you either love it or hate it. Here's my take: If you like to dress in Nikes, cargo shorts, T-shirts and baseball caps, you'll hate it. If you booked online with price being your only criteria and didn't do your homework, you'll also hate it. The decor is an acquired taste. It's pretty &quot;out there&quot; when you first walk in, but that's the point. Very dim lighting, and the furniture looks as if Tim Burton decorated it with leftovers from the set of &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; They really stress form over function, but the crazy seating in the lobby is really quite comfortable. From our experience, everyone on the hotel staff was friendly and professional, from the doormen to the bartenders in the Redwood room. The rooms were very comfortable also. Bathrooms were on the small side, but this hotel is not about hanging out in the bathroom, or watching TV, for that matter. Again, I think ones experience at the hotel depends totally on perspective. If you embrace the quirkiness and have a positive attitude, you will love the experience, from the atmosphere to the staff, but if you walk in and immediately feel as if it wasn't what you expected of a 4 star hotel and you don't fit in, you will find things to complain about..To those people, I'd suggest that they do a little research next time and stay somewhere else."
129,2030,"Jun 30 2008	Ew. Yuck.	This would be a Zero Star Review if we had the option! We were recommended the Clift by a friend who lives in SF and were excited when we saw the trendy photos on the web. We had friendly service when we checked in ... and then it all went downhill. The bathroom was smaller than most public restroom stalls and the shower did some weird scalding/freezing thing. There was no air vent in the bathroom so all of the mirrors and the window in the room fogged up with condensation and made the room feel wet and smell moldy. We tried to open the window (with help from the maintenance guy) and it actually came off the wall! We had to shut it and lock it just to keep it in place. There were stains in the carpet and weirdly, the cd on the nightstand was WET (yuck!) when we picked it up to check it out.I've read the reviews and the tvs ARE tiny, but hey, we were in SF for vacation and the last thing we wanted to do was watch tv. The breaking point for me was the staff. Service apparently is not a word they are familiar with. From the snobby and rude reception (and can we say SLOW?) to the incredibly pretentious servers in the Redwood Room, I found it hard to believe that we were at a 4 star hotel."
130,2030,"Jun 30 2008 	Worth going back to!	The Clift Hotel was amazing! It's somewhat hidden and inconspicuous (there's no signage outside) so you immediately feel like you're avoiding the tacky Las Vegas-style hotel. The lobby and entire lower level looks fantastic- it's dark and has a hip, young vibe. The bar and restaurant were both PACKED with a fun, trendy crowd every night we were there! The service was the best part of the experience. Every employee we spoke to was genuinely friendly and helpful in solving any problems that arose. (It also helps that the women who work at the hotel are good looking.) The concierge was knowledgable and recommended some of the best restaurants that I've been to in the U.S.My only complaint is about some of the furniture in the rooms. It looks cheap, especially the smaller tables which were made of translucent orange plastic. I will admit, though, that the beds are VERY comfortable. I overheard another guest complaining about the size of the TVs, which are rather small, but who watches television when they should be out exploring the city anyway?This hotel is best suited for young people who like to socialize, but I think anyone would feel comfortable there. There were a few children running around who looked out of place in the hotel's atmosphere, but even they were greeted with smiles from the staff.It was an excellent stay overall. I will definitely return to the Clift Hotel whenever I visit San Francisco."
131,2030,"Jun 30 2008 	50/50	The hotel is beautiful. There is atmosphere EVERYWHERE  from the darkened lair of a lobby, the colored glass in the elevators, the sparse and sleek furnishings of the bedrooms  but I'm not sure the price was worth it. The staff could be super accomodating, but they could also be flakey (how hard is it to get a New York Times and a San Francisco Chronicle at your door? It's on their website as an ammentity, but of all 9 days we stayed there, it only happened once (and I asked over and over and over....)) and the staff could also be snobbish. They seem to expect tips for the most minimal work. Oh, and while the room service is DELICIOUS it's pricey. Entrees are $20 for starters, and they charge $3.50 for bringing it upstairs, 15% gratutity and 5% for fun. Continental breakfast for two? That'll be $65. And everything in the area is absurdly overpriced (but if you walk two blocks into the Tenderloin, the prices become absurdly reasonable. Dottie's Cafe is amazing, as are the little Vietnamese places).And the room was fabulous. The linens were perfect, the view was wonderful and the location was incredible. We walked to Chinatown, we walked to the Mission, we took the Market Street buses EVERYWHERE. Oh, and the iPod dock was clutch.All in all, I guess it was a trade off."
132,2030,Jun 26 2008 	Fabulous!	We had a fab time at the Clift. The room was a very good size and had a king bed with a seperate dressing room/desk area. The bed was very very comfortable and the decor was modern and contemporary. Yes the bathrooms are small but how much time are you going to spend in a bathroom! The bar is lovely and has a great atmosphere but make sure you reserve a table. Watch out for the portraits on the walls! Overall a great stay
133,2030,"Jun 23 2008 	We really liked it!!!	I had reservations about this hotel from the reviews on here beforehand but we decided to go ahead and stay here for part of our Honeymoon.We took the unusual step of contacting the hotel before we booked it and asking for some information regarding the rooms.Assistant Manager Jenny Chmieleski was our contact and she could not have been more helpful.And we stayed at this hotel because of the help that Jenny gave us.Many Thanks Jenny,you really reassured us about your fabulous hotel.We got upgraded one level as a honeymoon bonus and we got upgraded when we arrived also to a Junior Suite.Aaron our bellboy was really helpful in helping us settle and only too willing to give advice.During our stay,we found the conceirge desk was also only too happy to help, with a special mention for Jessica(I think) and Ron.The hotel decor itself is really different than anything we had ever stayed in but we loved it.Although I will add that I can understand why some would not like it but it was to our taste.Our room was a nice size and decorated really nicely.The famous TV 's are small but we were assured that they were in the process of replacing them with LCD's.But they were fine and to be honest we did'nt come all this way to watch TV.The hotel is in a great location.The downside was we made a phone call home to Dublin,Ireland from our room.The call lasted around 10mins and it was to a landline.It cost $65...!!!!!!I know that ringing from a room usually costs alot more than a phone booth but this was quiet excessive.We got a phone card for $10 and made calls lasting 70mins.Also the internet charges were quiet expensive compared to other hotels that I have stayed in. But overall we really enjoyed our stay in Clift and in San Francisco.We will be back and we would stay in this hotel again,without question."
134,2030,"Jun 20 2008 	You can dress up an old tart but by midnight the make up wears off	Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in may 2008 Hotel and lobby are beautiful, full of attractive staff who look lke they are auditioning for a role for some upcomming hip soap, Asking them to so something to assist doesnt seem to be in their script.Location is fairly central .Rooms have been spruced up but being an old hotel the refurb has been done cheaply.Room had a 15 year old small tv, which was faulty and kept turning off every 15 minslock mechanism on door was faulty which meant every time i returned to my room i had to go to front desk to get a new keycard, was offered a free drink for this inconvienance as a reformed alcoholic , was offended with trying to be bribed with a drink.Wireless internet dropped out every 30 mins bathroom was at least 30 years old with a few fluff designer pieces used to disguise this fact.raised this issues at checkout and was credited with internet fee and front desk clerked, seemed to be aware of the issues i had raised, as im sure its a regular occurence.Basically overpriced hotel with the attitute of an old tart who thinks putting on a bit of make up will hide this fact Michael Melbourne Australia"
135,2030,"Jun 11 2008 	Worst hotel experience. Ever.	Hotel came highly recommended and was a HUGE disappointment. Pretentious, uninterested staff, terrible food, terrible rooms. Worst hotel stay ever. When we raised questions or problems they were completely uninterested in resolving them. BEWARE as well, they conduct wedding receptions in the hotel and the noise from them is so bad you feel like you are staying above a booming nightclub. Not really what you expect for the price! Also if you are not attending the wedding you are treated like a second rate guest and given the worst rooms and service. Both my colleague and I after a 15 hour flight were given rooms next to the service elevator (so we found at 5am with a bang every 30 seconds). When I rang reception I was told that this should have been explained to me when I booked in. I pointed out them that obviously if it had have been explained to me at check in I would have refused the room. I was then told I could just change rooms. When I asked if the hotel actively engages in a policy of just putting guests in these rooms until they complain this was not refuted. Just one of the many problems encountered. To many to go into detail on all. Do not stay here."
136,2030,"Jun 10 2008	Disappointing and watch the final bill	I've stayed at quite a few of the Morgan group hotels and whilst most of them are starting to look a bit dated (given the price) I've returned as generally the atmosphere makes up for it. I wouldn't return to The Clift; the Redwood Bar is fun and the concierge/front door staff are all good but that's about it. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen (and I had a loft suite) - and for the price other hotels offer more (no flat screen TV, ineffective air con). What really irritated me was when I checked my credit card they had charged me an additional US$185 for late checkout without any notification (I had used their express checkout service and left the room by 11.00am). E mailed the hotel twice - no response and finally had to phone to obtain a refund - which they made immediately but with no apology or explanation."
137,2030,"Jun 1 2008	Amazing	The Clift Hotel was an amazing experience. I decided to visit San Francisco for the Union Square fare and the Clift hotel was one block away from Union Square. I have to say that what I liked the most was the hotel's lobby decoration.The service was very good but not outstanding.The food was great and the ambiance in the bar was that of a red carpet event.Finally, our room was a bit small but well decorated and clean."
138,2030,May 27 2008	Pretentious pretentious pretentious...	Stayed here for a night with some friends for a wedding. The hotel staff was rude and acted like a bunch of premadonas. Everyone assoctated with this place thought their you know what didn't stink. I would highly reccommend a hotel called &quot;The Phoenix&quot; over this place. At least there you can get good service and a more confortable experience. Please take my advice... Stay away from THe Clift Hotel. Unless you are into travel nightmares.
139,2030,"Apr 30 2008	A great place to stay when you are in San Fran	I'd been to the infamous Red Wood Room bar in the Clift Hotel a number of times on past visits and always thought it would be nice to stay there - I finally got my chance last week! It was pretty cool! I didnt realise it was part of the Morgan Group until I got there and once I found out, it didnt surprise me as I have stayed in one of their most well known hotels in London called the Sanderson Hotel, which is also pretty cool. The Clift reminds me of the style of the W Hotel in that it is dark, opulent, contenporary and funky - the rooms are small but they are sexy and have large mirrors, drapes and are minimalist in design. The gym in the hotel was pretty limited but it did the job. No Spa or Jacuzzi either. But you know what? When you are staying in the CLift - you dont care, because it is a really cool place to stay and you are slap bang in the middle of town, and walking distance to the best shops in town in Union Square and some of the best places to go out (Slide and Vessel are two that spring to mind). If you are willing to pay a little more to get the slightly more special treatment - I would say this is a great place to stay! I was there with 20 or so people from the UK on a Web Mission tour to meet the movers and shakers from the Valley and I am so glad they decided that this was the place to stay instead of in the heart of the Valley itself."
140,2030,"Apr 28 2008 	Complete Disappointment	This hotel is a complete disappointment. The lobby gives off a luxurious vibe and the Redwood Room is very cool (if you fancy expensive drinks). However, my stay in the hotel was a disaster. The gray, threadbare carpet was stained with red spots in multiple places, the cheap IKEA furniture was falling apart, and the bathroom was way too small. However, any of these things would have been tolerable if I had been able to sleep. Our next door neighbors partied all night, and despite calls to security, nothing was done about it. I slept maybe one hour that night. Either the hotel needs to invest in sound proofing, or it needs to revise its party policy. San Francisco is an amazing town and I still had a great trip, but I will not be revisiting this hotel, ever."
141,2030,"Apr 28 2008 	Worst hotel experience ever!	I have stayed at a number of Shraeger properties around the world, this really was the worst. The lobby is quintessentially Shraeger - very dark but overall not bad. I am assuming that the dark lobby essentially masks the dirt that is everywhere else. The room I got was supposed to be a suite - really more like a larger room with a miniscule bathroom.The room was quite simply, dirty. The room was DIRTY - there was a used condom under the bed and there was a used plaster in the toilet. The carpets were dirty and worn. One simply does not expect this sort of dirt in a supposedly good hotel.The furniture is from IKEA. For a hotel that is supposedly selling itself on design, this looked like a poster-child for how to furnish your room from IKEA in poor taste.The bathroom was tiny, stained and had cheap fixtures and a rusty rail. The shampoo etc in the bathroom were FUSED shut so you could not use them. Luckily we had some personal toilletries. The thing that irked me the most was that there was no water in room. Most good hotels have at least some complimentary water, if not water in the minibar. I have stayed very recently at the Clift and KNOW that you provide complimentary water on arrival - but this time round there was no water. There was no water in the minibar either. Had to call room service and then got CHARGED $15 for a bottle of WATER which costs $1.50 anywhere else. This was DAYLIGHT ROBBERY but as we had got to the hotel late, we were too tired. We told the front desk the next day and got a nonchalant and haughty reply from the front desk - and they claimed that they NEVER provide any complimentary water in the room and did not apologise for the fact that there was no water in the minibar - they did not even offer to take the water off the bill or at least reduce the price to what it would have been to buy it from the minibar. I think the barefaced lies and treatment after this was what irked me the most.The residents next door came back at 2 in the morning, shouting and singing. When we called downstairs, nothing was done to stop our drunk and disorderly neighbours from being a nuisance. Lastly, the front desk staff I spoke to about the water was just RUDE. I know the MOndrian group is about the &quot;cool, snobby&quot; attitude but that does not amount to customer service. The staff are more interested in whether they have enough hair gel and in chatting to each other than serving the customer. I have stayed at a number of Shraeger properties and have decided finally that for the price one pays, the design does not compensate for what are essentially low quality, poorly-serviced rooms with cheap bathroom fittings, toilletries and electronics (e.g. I don't know any other chain that still has box TVs - they are all flat screen except at the Clift which seems to have a bunch of TVs from the 80s).I never give feedback - but this stay was of SUCH low quality that I thought I would let others know. I plan to send this to journalist friends I have at Conde Nast and The Times in the UK. If the clientele the Clift is trying to attract are low-class drunks with no taste, then I suppose, in that context at least, they are doing a good job."
142,2030,"Apr 19 2008	The Clift Rocks	My colleague and I loved The Clift!!! I arrived in San Francisco on a 11 1/2 hour fligth - and was SO happy to be checked-in and given a good recommendation to eat at Dottie's down the way. When I check-in on Saturday the box my company had delivered was promptly brought up to my room. When I returned at night (fighting jet lag) did they think I was some kind of celebrity???....their was definitely an imaginary red carpet. The service quiet simply ROCKS. The welcome candy is a sweet gesture. Over the next few days I had the pleasure of staying at The Clift - the concierge, housekeeping, doormen...everyone definitely made their mark. In such a wonderful city, I could really care less about the size of the TV. The bathroom is industrial funky and I had no problems moving about drying my hair. The table/basin thing has a shelf below where there were lots of towels - and the robes were wonderful. Personally I'm confused about the comments about the availability of drawers. To me, aside from putting a few things on hangars - its normal to live out of a suitcase when travelling. Who has time to unpack everything just to be repacked again? LOLThe 9 hour differnece in time zones causes hungar at odd times occassionaly - the minibar has a diverse selection...drinks are expensive....its sorta like hint hint....don't stay in your room...we have the best bar in the city...come on down! The breakfast buffet was great and prompt....good for my colleague and I to be able to eat at a normal pace and not worry about waiting for service....quick quick!! The wifi was a bit slow - but the hotel was packed..maybe that's why...too many users??? My room was only on the 3rd floor but quiet. The lobby is always crazy at night but comfortable. I'm never happy with beds - they're always too hard for me! (so my opinion probably doesn't help much in that area) oh ...but see the last paragraph!From the other reviews I think there is a target market for this kind of hotel. Younger, chic, busy, image-concious...more interested in the redroom lounge than the size of tv.To everyone at The Clift on the morning of my departure - thank you for being so caring and coming upstairs after half an hour of trying to wake me. After a month of flying back and forth across the atlantic and being completely anemic from a rare blood disorder..i was a little more exhausted than I was willing to admit. I pushed the limits! I'm glad you checked to make sure that I was okay ....it meant the world to me that you were so professional. See you soon! bisous bisous!"
143,2030,"Apr 18 2008 	Lobby very nice....hotel is a dump.	Aside from the lobby which is pretty funky and very nice(only because they want to draw the bar crowd) the rest of the hotel is a dump. Someone got the bright idea to take either an old motel or old apartment building, paint EVERYTHING purple, shrink the tv, and stock it with REALLY CHEAP Ikea looking furniture. I've stayed at &quot;boutique&quot; hotels before in San Fran and NYC (The W) and was very impressed so I was expecting the same. Along with everything above the lobby level being crappy, the views out of most windows consist of looking directly at other room's fire escapes. We had been staying at the Park 55 around the corner and moved to the The Clift because of reviews we had read but checked out and back into the Park 55 first thing the next morning. If you are looking for a retro feeling dump filled with 21-25 year old trendy peeps dressed in all black from NYC.....AND....you want to pay too much....then this is the hotel for you. I WILL SAY that the valets and doormen were very very helpful and on the ball (even though they look like secret service that takes themselves too seriously.) If you want a &quot;boutique&quot; hotel in San Fran go to The W. The Park 55 was very nice too."
144,2030,"Apr 8 2008 	Loved the Clift	Trendy hotel, centrally located in Union Square area. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Loved the furniture in the lobby especially the tall high chair, check it out. The buffet breakfast was wonderful. Only complaint was the television in the room was too small. Otherwise, i definitely recommend this cool, chic hotel."
145,2030,"Mar 18 2008 	Clift Hotel is great!	Love the Clift very stylish hotel. Service is always great from every aspect... doormen, cleaning people, front desk are always friendly, rooms are always clean, etc. It's not a typical touristy hotel... it has a specific clientle. Although you can find a good room rate, dont expect to get away cheaply. Two appetizers and four glasses of wine will run around $120 (plus tip) at the Redwood Room or dinner for two at Asia de Cuba can easily cost over $250. If you have trouble sleeping or like to sleep in forget it... the walls are very thin. Unfortunately, our room was on the 4th floor right next to the service elevator (rm 431) and you could hear the ding of the elevator bell every time it stopped (day and night) on nearby floors. On the other side of us were kids (surprisingly). I sleep with ear plugs so that wasn't an issue for me. We opted to stay in the room since it wasn't too bad. Other than the room location and thin wall everything else was great."
146,2030,"Mar 14 2008 	Over the Top pretentious and fun	Philippe Starck San Fran style. If you;ve ever been to one of these hotels, then you don't need to know much. Got a small room for a killer deal of $165, then was upgraded to the top (17th floor) for 40 more and they threw in 4 drink coupons for the Redwood Room, arguably SF's coolest lounge. Drinks are about $14 there. The restaurant is simply too expensive, given that SF has some very good and reasonable restaurants. The elevators were my favorite part, one in green, one in red and one in blue glass. Location is fantastic, and the bell staff is very accomodating."
147,2030,"Mar 4 2008	Great Hotel not FANTASTIC	I have to say it was very stylish and very quiet which was nice. Loved the proximity to Union Square, Biscuit and Blues, and dance and comedy clubs. The bathroom was pretty funny, tiny, but go figure, you only need one in there at a time anyways. The bar downstairs is full of action. Valet a bit on the pricey side at $50 a day, the sites dont tell you that so consider yourself informed."
148,2030,Feb 17 2008	stay or the bar	The hotel is very cool. The design is fantastic. The lobby and the library next to it are fun just to hang out in and people watch. We asked for a quiet room and got a large room and it was very quiet...no city sounds at all. However...the bathrooms in the hotel are a joke. So small my wife couldn't blow dry her hair without her elbows hitting the door or a wall. Seriously...they are that small. The TV is something you could buy for 49 dollars at a Big Lots. The beds and linens were good but do not compare to the great beds in places like the San Ysidro ranch in Santa Barbara or at the Meadowood resort in Napa. But the reason to stay there is the bar...The redwood bar. It's the best bar I've ever been in...I could have lived there. The restaurant is also beautiful and the food is good. If you need a great bathroom or a flat screen TV this is not the hotel for you...but if you love great design and you like to hang in bars...this is the best hotel in San Francisco.
149,2030,"Feb 12 2008 	Stylish but not too practical	Very Stylish hip hotel, The lobby for some reason reminded me of the movie eyes wide shut, kind of dark and wierd and clientele were older men mostly. It was very uniquely decorated and trendy, but may not be for everyone. The room itself was nice and modern but was not the most comfortable/functional. Not very many drawers on bedside table or desk, the chair was not very comfortable either. The bathroom, appeared very nice due to the modern decor with all the mirrors but also proved not very functional. After every shower, the condensation builds up against the mirror and drips all on the floor causing a wet puddle which you could easily hurt yourself! I would probably stay at the Clift again because of the innovative design/decor but the bathroom was a big problem."
150,2030,"Feb 10 2008 	Not what I expected . . .	I stayed at the Clift while on a business trip to San Francisco along with several of my colleagues. The hotel is much different than any I've stayed in the past. The lobby is quite unique with the decor akin to East meets West (or so it seemed to me). The furniture in the lobby is very uncomfortable and is probably more for show than sitting. The decor included a grossly oversized chair that I dubbed the &quot;Paul Bunyan&quot; chair. As others point out in their review, the lobby bar is quite a hot spot. On the Friday night that I stayed there, it was packed and people were lined up on the street waiting to getting in. The hotel is very dimly lit throughout. The lobby, restaurant, the common areas, elevators, and my guest room had low lighting. It was nearly impossible to read anything while in the lobby due to the lighting. While the bed in my room was very comfortable, the room was small with a tiny closet and bathroom. There were no drawers so I lived out of my suitcase while I was there. There were two small plastic cubes in the closet and these may have been intended to substitute for the drawers. Also, there was absolutely no storage or counter space in the bathroom. The TV was tiny; I don't remember the brand, but it is one of the small ones you get at Sam's or Costco for $100 - $150. I was amazed that the hotel charged $14.95 a day for internet access. Many hotels provide that free of charge these days.I will not stay at this hotel again. It was pricey for the lack of amenities, and far too trendy."
151,2030,"Jan 28 2008 	Kind of weird place	My 81 year old father in law recommended this property...believe it or not! I wonder if he really stayed here or just had a drink in the bar area. Everything in the lobby, bar, restaurant areas was top notch. It was really beautiful. Kind of clubby with dark wood colors. Warm fireplace in the lobby area. It was really beautiful. The doormen and check in staff were polite and very efficient. We were so excited to see our room. WOW! What a disappointment! It was really small and decorated with a sleigh bed, which was very comfortable. Down bedding, etc. But the furnishings were kind of like an IKEA blow out sale. My husband and I decided that they must have spent all their money on the lobby and common areas and ran out by the time it came to outfit the rooms. The bedside tables were bright orange lucite and scratched up. Burn holes were in the carpet. The desk was a cheap thing with the legs painted orange. Small armoire held a small TV. The room color was purple. So purple and orange was the color scheme. My husband said the bathroom resembled a mens room in an airport. Very odd for this level of hotel. Marbel walls were stained and dingy. Bath tub was small and had dried paint in the bottom. The toiltries were nice but it was all so tacky. We looked out our window and found a foil wrapper from a condom lying just outside our window and lots of cigarette butts. We were in room 227 and the room looks out over a sort of roof top where there must be some action happening when we weren't looking! They have tea candles at the bedside and mirrors surround the bed. The location of the hotel was wonderful in Union Square. Starbucks was just across the street so we got coffee their rather than pay 22.00 for coffee by room service. No in room coffee or ice or really anything. Just weird how such a nice outside could have such an ugly inside.....just like some people I guess. They really missed the mark of sprucing up the rooms a bit and having a top notch facility. It could be one with just a little work!"
152,2030,"Jan 25 2008 	Jump off the Clift	Recently my family and I traveled to San Francisco to attend a family function in the Silicon Valley. Since we were only in the area for a long weekend, we decided to spend the first 2 nights in San Francisco. While previously we have stayed at the Fairmont and the Westin St. Francis, we decided to give the Clift a try due to a promotion that was being offered through American Express. Unfortunately our experience was not what we had anticipated. First, while the Clift is only 2 blocks from Union Square, it is not in a neighborhood where you want to walk at night. While San Francisco and for that matter, most major cities on the west coast have large homeless populations, such matter was most evident around the Clift. It seemed that at night you could not walk more than a couple of feet without bumping into a homeless person begging for money. In fact it appeared that some of these people were quite agressive. The hotel itself was obviously at some time an old apartment building or hotel which had been renovated. The lobby area is unique and clearly the hotel bar is a night spot for the single crowd. Unfortunately, the lighting is terrible. Such problem persisted throughout the hotel into the elevators and rooms. Our room was called a loft suite, but we use the word &quot;suite&quot; loosely. Really it was nothing more than an oversized room with a microsized bathroom. There was little lighting and the television was so small, you almost needed a microscope to see it. Moreover, you would have expected that a hotel with the purported reputation of the Clift would be luxurious. I would hardly classify it as a luxury hotel in the same class as the Fairmont. The staff was efficient, but certainly not friendly. We had to wait much too long to obtain our car and drop it off due to the fact that the staff was too busy handling the cars of patrons of the bar, obviously an important part of the financial operation. At over $50.00 per night to park our car, we expect priority service. Additionally, much of the staff wear earphones and dress like the secret service standing around and staring at everyone. I am not sure if these people are props in an effort to create a chic environment or just there to scare off anyone who walks through the door and may not be going to his or her room or the bar. All in all, I would not stay at the Clift again. There are too many more desirable hotels in San Francisco in much better neighborhoods and locations. As a side note, the hotel breakfast was great since it came with the room package, but without the package would be pricey. However, up the street off of Union Square is a restaurant called Sears. It is a San Francisco institution and I would highly recommend it for breakfast."
153,2030,"Jan 17 2008 	Not Typical 4-Star But Very Nice!	My wife and I flew to San Francisco to celebrate our 2 year anniversary and named our own price for a Union Square 4 Star Hotel using priceline. We were very excited to see that we saved over 1/2 compared to the usual price of a room at the Clift. I then logged onto tripadvisor to read some of the reviews of the place we were about to stay. To my disappointment, many people gave the Clift a negative review. After looking at some photos and reading some reviews I knew more of what to expect from the Clift when we arrived.Upon our arrival, we entered the lobby, and yes, many people may consider the lobby area &quot;odd&quot; but, like the rest of the hotel, it had unique charm. The people behind the desk were very very nice and the beds were very very cozy. Yes, the room itself and the bathrooms were a little small, but everything was very clean, and they even provide candles and matches in the rooms to provide a very romantic ambiance.I guess what I am trying to say is that The Clift is NOT your typical 4-Star hotel, yet is holds its own charm from the friendly staff, to the unique decorating, and provided bedside candles. If you book a room at the Clift, I think it helps to read the reviews and look at the photos and know what to expect from the Clift before your arrival. Overall, my wife and I had a very positive experience at the Clift and a great trip to San Francisco!"
154,2030,"Jan 4 2008	Horrible management	I was immediately disappointed from the moment I went to my room. I called and spoke with a very polite front desk agent about the room. I explained to him that the walls were paper-thin (could hear a normal conversation next door clearly, word-for-word) and that the room was very, very small for the $245 I spent a night.He told me he'd have management call. I spoke with the desk manager, Ben, and he was incredibly rude. He was not accomodating and said there wasn't much he could do if we weren't happy. Though the agent was more than helpful and apologetic, Ben was nothing more than useless. Clearly, you can tell he is not at all interested in his guests and is just there to make money.Unfortunately, I will not be returning due to his attitude and lack of effort. Otherwise, I think i could have really had a good vacation. Never seen a manager with such a lack of responsibility and disregard. I'd love to see him go through the same problem at another hotel on his vacation!"
155,2030,"Jan 2 2008 	Hip but Hopeless	My husband and I stayed at the Clift the weekend before Christmas. He had originally thought of the Clift because as it was a weekend away from our children, we would enjoy staying in a &quot;hip&quot; hotel, having a drink at the Redwood and enjoy the hotel's proximity to everything downtown. BUT--the reality was: In our first room the walls were so thin we could hear lilterally every word of our neighbors (and therefore they could also hear ours). We were given a tip that the best rooms were on the 17th floor. So we asked to be moved to that floor and we felt lucky that they had a room available, but the room had it's own issues, right next to the elevator shafts. So all night long we heard the whooshing of the elevators going up and down. So onto the third room the next morning. Luckily they finally took care of us and put us into a suite, but it was a little too late. Half of our weekend was over and we spent way too much time trying to resolve our room issues. Next time we'll do it the right way and stay at the Mandarin or the Four Seasons. For not much more per night, we'll be hassle-free."
156,2030,"Dec 31 2007 	Stylish but overrated	Arriving at Clift on Friday evening felt more like fighting your way through the pretentious crowd of local wannabes congregated in the hotels lobby and bars. Once we made it to the reception desk, the checking in was efficient. Room: the standard room we booked was small by European standards. The bed was large and comfortable; the bed linen was clean but showing its age (staining and wear holes) however it was changed at our first request. The bathroom likewise was very small. In fact, shaving was quite difficult because of the restricted space. The bathroom fittings were dated and stained and we did not expect to see a tired-looking bath-curtain in a hotel claiming a reputation for style. We dined at the Asia de Cuba restaurant. The service was attentive and helpful, the setting of the restaurant stylish but the food left us a little under-whelmed  the quality and presentation did not meet the quality of the surroundings. The Redwood Room: stylish interior but at times  noisy and crowded and the service was aloof. Bar staff needs reminding that rudeness and arrogance does not necessarily equal style or elegance. Overall, the location is good with Philippe Stark giving the interior some refreshing innovation. But this seems to be a hotel to be enjoyed by aspiring locals out to be seen rather than for the hotel guests themselves."
157,2030,"Dec 28 2007 	Stylish and Fun	I stay here often for business. Its very convenient to Union Square (a 2 block walk). This is an older hotel that had a great face lift probably 5 years ago or so. The rooms are really spacious and comfortable -- and the color scheme is quite relaxing. I've been in rooms with both big bathrooms and some that are tiny so that just depends. You hear some creeks in the hallway - again, because its an older hotel, but that just adds to its charm. And the staff are super friendly - something I'm always impressed to find at 'trendy boutique hotels'.The bar - the Redwood Room - is quite the scene and always packed at night. But as a guest, you get priority for a seat, which is nice! The restaurant is Asia de Cuba -- excellent asian food. Of course its all a bit pricey -- especially for breakfast (true for so many hotels!)."
158,2030,Dec 26 2007	Did not like the Clift	Awful hotel and the amenities are horrible. The rooms are small and poorly equiped. Orange lucite nite stands with no place to put away your clothes. TV 's are from the dark ages and only a few channels. It was a hotel that one should stay away from. The only good thing is the location is on Geary Street close to everything. But other than that don't bother as there are other hotels in the area that are the same price as it is not a cheap hotel.
159,2030,Dec 16 2007	worst hotel I have ever stayed at	A friend was having a party at the hotel for his 40th birthday. It was cocktails and dinner in the Cuba de Asia room. He had about 10 rooms of people staying over. I checked into my room and was handed an envelope immediatly. Inside was a letter from the manager stating there was a change of plans and to meet at a restaurant across town. My husband and I quickly dressed and caught a cab because of the earlier time. It was raining and my ankle was sprained. The bay bridge on ramps were closed for the bridge remodel and it took 45 minutes to go across town. After $50 for the cab we got to the restaurant only to find that there was no party. I managed to reach one of the other party goers who said they didnt receive a letter and everything was still on at the hotel. I called the hotel to see what was going on and was hung up on by the manager. We got back to the hotel to be told the manager was busy and we needed to wait to talk to him. He came and rolled his eyes and said there must have been a mix up and it was no big deal. Apparently another guest has a similar name to mine. I guess it wasn't his $70 in cab rides and 2 hours wasted. I wrote a letter to the manager and they sent me a coupon for $50 off my next stay. OH BOY WHAT A DEAL. The party was good buy my friend was upset by the hotel service that he got after spending so much there. Also the hotel was a case of the emporers new clothes! The decor everyone raved about was straight out of clearance at IKEA!! I was not impressed by the snobbishness of it all. Good service includes graciousness. Also if they screw up they should take responsibility. This is the first complaint letter I have ever made. So much time has past since it happend but a friend just mentioned they would be booking some family here. I felt it important to list this so people weren't taken in by this supposed 5 star hotel.
160,2030,"Dec 15 2007	Can't believe this is a 5-star hotel	If I didn't pay $129 per night through expedia, I would have been pretty upset. Stayed 4 nights. The best thing was the Union Square location.As others have written, very trendy, wannabe hotel. The lobby and bar are cool, however, after 6:30 p.m., try getting a seat or a drink. My $11 margarita was made with sweet &amp; sour. YukI thought the rooms were terrible. The scandavavian furniture reminded me of IKEA. Small rooms, even smaller bathrooms. Platform beds not comfortable. There was no real furniture in the room - except the unit that housed the 19&quot; TV and minibar. I was there for mulitple nights and could have used the usual armoir - yes, I know, probably not trendy, but functional. Orange clear plastic end tables - yuk. Stayed in room 712 - facing into the rooms at the Monaco....wishing I stayed there. Lots of people stumbling into rooms at 3:00 a.m. and you could hear everything - the trouble with staying in hotel with younger crowd - I realize thats my problem and not the hotels.Valet parking is $51.30 per day(including parking tax) RIPOFF. Internet service in the room is $10.00 per day RIPOFF. There is a parking lot literally 30 yards away on Taylor for $24 per night - in and out privledges.I would stay at any of the other surrounding hotels in a NY minute - Prescott still is my favorite"
161,2030,"Dec 9 2007 	Service Was Good!	I think it's important to know what you want when you book a hotel in San Francisco. Me, I want grandiose!!! I thought with &quot;The Clift&quot; I was giving up grandiose for contemporary greatness. It was ok.I want a hotel that &quot;WOWs&quot; me when I walk in.. The Clift was dark, and just ok to me. The Redwood Room was just ok to me as well. I guess I didn't get it. Someone commented that at The Clift you give up comfort to be at the &quot;hip&quot; hotel. But, I didn't want &quot;hip&quot;, I wanted extravagence. I should have payed better attention to those other reviews.SERVICE: Upon arrival the doorman were great. I never opened a door for myself as other poster have stated. We even used the semi-limonsine service that parks out front to get around. Expensive, but we were celebrating our anniversary and didn't care about the cost, not for that, at least. The front desk was also helpful and even gave us a 2:30 late check outROOM: It was big, since we booked a junior suite, but the bed was very hard. The bedding was nice and the mirrors surrounding the bed are nice. But the rest of the furniture in the room is uncomfortable and cheap looking. There were two TV's in the room but they are pretty small. I didn't care so much about that, since I was not there to watch TV.REDWOOD ROOM: OK, here is where I don't get it. So to be hip you hang out at the Redwood Room. We arrived back to the hotel after seeing a play, and we got help from one of the ladies at the door in getting a drink. That was nice. What I didn't like was they played very loud &quot;hip&quot; music. I was on my anniversay, and wanted to dance, but no one was dancing, slow or fast. The dance floor was somewhere in the back with people standing on it and talking, I think. Never could make it back that far in the room. My daughter later told me that nowadays, they don't play slow music to dance, until right before closing, if even then. The people were all crowded around yelling at one another, since you can't hear cause the music is so loud. To get a table at The Clift you have to buy a &quot;bottle&quot; of some kind of booze, starting at $200.00+. It was the end of our evening, around midnight, and weren't going to pound down a bottle or even close, so we got no seat. My husband and I stood there and watched people. It's a younger crowd mainly, with a few old foogies trying to pick up on young women. Not my scene. No view, no seat, and I did not see one celebrity, just some young people with cute attire. I'm in SF and I want a view and some ambience, something, but at the Redwood room, I could have easily been been in someone's garage for what it was.OVERALL: I would give this hotel three stars. I should have booked the Fairmont or any other Hotel in Nob Hill, or maybe the St. Regis or the Hilton. Not sure how it can be identified as a Four star hotel, since that's just one star from being a &quot;fairmont, or St. Regis. This is a three star at best."
162,2030,"Nov 30 2007	Great decor but beware of the tiny bathrooms!	Expensive, ultra trendy, but disappointing for the money.The Clift is a boutique style hotel right in the heart of San Francisco's downtown art gallery district and within easy walking distance of Union Square, awesome art galleries and photo galleries and the nightclubs and bars of the city.The major downfall is that the hotel bathrooms at The Clift hardly have enough room to swing a cat and for the price paid (around $300 per room per night) it isn't all that great. I was impressed with the lobby decor and the log fire in the foyer lounge area is comfortable and welcoming.Great for location and trend, but not great for guests who wish to have spacious hotel rooms."
163,2030,"Nov 23 2007 	Hip Hype	This was a special birthday trip for my husband and I wanted it to be special, so spent more $$ than I normally would on the hotel. My heart sank when we were shown our Superior King room, which was so cramped. I called the front desk immediately with no answer, so I had to go down there. The clerk said the Superior is bigger than the standard, but they were booked so she couldn't move us until the next day. I settled for it because I didn't want to appear unhappy and spoil it for my husband.The decor was beautiful, silks and soft colors. However, there was no room to put anything, no drawers at bedside, just these weird plastic day-glo orange cubes. No comfortable chairs, either. The bathroom was super tiny - no room to move, no counter space and if you used the sink, everything in the bathroom got splashed. It was just all physically uncomfortable.The Redwood Room (bar) was gorgeous, with very tasty drinks and appetizers. On weekends, only bottle service is served, but hotel guests get priority reservations and can order without bottle service. I won't stay there again, but might pop into the Redwood Room (if they'll let me) for a drink."
164,2030,"Nov 20 2007 	Party Hotel Yes Comfort No!!!	My husband and I stayed at the Clift for a weekend. The bed was a rock and the walls are paper thin. Rooms are old and carpet looked like it needed a good cleaning. Or better yet, replaced. We got a complimentary upgrade upon check-in because we were celebrating our anniversary but if that was an upgrade I would hate to see their regular rooms. At night the lobby bar turns into a very loud night club. It's so crowded that you can't get into the hotel without showing your hotel ID card at the door. You can't even find a place to sit and have drink if you're coming back from a day of sightseeing. Is this a hotel or a nightclub?? If you are in your early 20's and you rather have a loud crowded club feeling than quality &amp; comfort than this is your hotel. I can think of one good thing........the hotel is in a great location. But so are a lot of other hotels. Once was enough for us."
165,2030,"Nov 12 2007 	Will never return to the Clift	Overall I really disliked this hotel. I met an old college room mate Nov 5-8/07 and she booked the room. She had stayed in the hotel years ago with her Mom and loved the old fashioned atmosphere and the bar. The hotel is now a plastic,poorly lit and unfriendly place - or I am just too old to appreciate how cool it is. The lighting in the room was terrible, the furniture was ugly and actually non functional - we could not unpack our clothes as there was no where to put anything buta dimly lit closet (painted deep purple). The bathroom was tiny (not so unusual in old hotels) but why was there no where to put anything or even hang a towel? The walls were mainly large mirrors - with huge curtains - it was scary. In the hall by our elevator stood two GLASS chairs. The elevators were basically plastic cubes with no lights in them.These same plastic cubes in orange were our night tables. The lobby is dark and cold and the decor is boutique style ridiculous. Thestaff were hot and cold - mostly cold ( nice concierge though).The safe in the closet is too high to reach for anyone under 6'3&quot;. Overall if you are over 30 do not stay here - you will be uncomfortable and feel ripped off.The towels and robes are very nice though. I wish I had better things to say - I love San Francisco - next time I am hoping to find a comfortable place to stay with a nice happy feelto it ."
166,2030,"Nov 12 2007 	Superb but expensive experience	The Clift is a five-star experience in every respect. As a frequent patron before the remodel, it is a shock to see the French decor give way to the new minimalist look. The rooms are pretty white with the two walls covered with mirrors to make the smallish room seem much larger. Fine quality bedding makes for a luxurious nights sleep. In keeping with an eco-friendly environment, it is a little dim in the entry way and no light in the closet.The staff was friendly and helpful, at the front desk, concierge and the front door staff. The rain interrupted the smooth flow of traffic, and we had 20 minute waits both to drop off our car and to retreive it. Everyone was working hard and helpful, but the infrequent rains in San Frnacisco seemed to overwhelm them.The main dining room was fabulous. The unusual blend of Asian and Cuban cuisine was delicious and presented boldly with lots and lots of food. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful -- especially about not ordering too much as the portions were huge. The scallops were perfect; our calamari salad was delicious, and we split a main course of steak that was so tender it could be cut with a fork. There was a mix-up on our dinner reservation, but they promptly took responsibility and we were seated within 5 minutes on a busy Saturday night. Everyone was quite pleasant and helpful.Overall, it was an outstanding experience. Close to Union Square and shopping. I missed the old French decor, but &quot;in with the new&quot; was not much of a disappointment."
167,2030,"Nov 10 2007	Excellent service great location nice rooms	I don't understand the other reviews about service being poor - my experience (8-10 Nov 07) was quite the opposite with very friendly and attentive staff wherever I went in the hotel.I got upgraded to a one-bed suite, including 8 seater dining table. All very funky but a bit sparse.The bathroom was very small and the location of the loo somewhat under the washbasin unit was a bit odd - it made the experience quite uncomfortable!The public areas are very beautiful and the location - one block from Union Square is excellent."
168,2030,"Nov 8 2007 	Debacle of a hotel	Classic case of a hotel pretending to be nice when it really isn't. A few things:1. Terrible service at the Redwood Room. Terrible.2. Laughably unprofessional staff at the bellhop and at the reception (&quot;unfortunately this is not a very nice room&quot; was what I was told when my reserved king bedroom/non-smoking room was not available and that I'd instead have a room with 2 full beds on a smoking floor. Awesome.)3. Shabby rooms without the basics (nice sheets, coffee makers, a shower head that functions comfortably, a television other than a 12&quot; 1988 Samsung model etc.). 4. The comedy of errors included a 4 AM [false] fire alarm that found me dressed in a robe in the lobby, an unscheduled 7:20 AM wake-up by my alarm clock (who ever checks to make sure the alarm clock is set for off?) and another unwanted 9 AM wake-up from the television in the room next door. A perfect trifecta of no sleep!(The false alarm is [most-likely] no fault of theirs but we could have done without the snickering hotel employee on the PA telling us it was a false alarm. I mean, it's f'cking hilarious to be woken up at 4 in the morning expecting the worse, right?)This place is the pits. Our server at Asia de Cuba was the only redeeming point of the experience and all he did was serve us breakfast straight-forwardly without pissing me off.Needless to say, I can't recommend this place to anyone unless that person enjoys over-spending on crap."
169,2030,"Nov 8 2007	Miffed at the Clift	A big, beautiful room with a breathtaking view  and thats it.This hotels completely inattentive and unprofessional staff dampened our vacation spirits. Rather than feeling like a guest at the Clift, my boyfriend and I felt like we were imposing and unwelcome.Yes, the Redwood Room is amazing. Yes, Asia de Cuba serves a unique fare, but with a staff just &quot;too cool for school and completely uninterested in making a guest feel comfortable and at home, everything good is wasted.With so many choices today, customer service is of UTMOST importance and apparently the Clift just doesnt get this. Spend your money somewhere else, unless of course, you enjoy being treated like dirt."
170,2030,"Nov 8 2007 	Lovin The Clift	The Clift is form over function but if you're looking for somewhere to stay that makes you feel cool then this is the place. Our room was a decent size, the staff were perfectly pleasant and the bar/restaurant is fantastic (if a little on the expensive side).We paid about 120 per night and i wouldn't go above that for a standard room."
171,2030,"Nov 6 2007	Hmmm... Firealarm at 3 am and walls like paper.. Stay again? No	We stayed here for 2 night in November. Although the hotel looks great and has great location, it misses 2 basic things which make a good hotel: good communications and a good nights rest. First, our room was so not-quiet that you could hear any conversation in the next room word for word. And not only that, but also the neighbours TV who was watching porn all through the night... Secondly we had an incident where the firealarm went off at 3 a.m. A very shocking experience which I never hope to go through again. After about a minute of a alarm at about 80dB and sheer disorientation and panic someone annouced that we should remain calm. Wow, this guys was helping us. Again about a minute later while we were halfway the stairs it was annouced that the SFFD has given the all clear. That was before any fire truck had pulled up before the hotel (which happened 2 some minutes later) So ok, next morning we expected a &quot;Sorry&quot; and an explanation, but too bad the hotel management felt no need to explain this to it's customers. Too bad. For us that was an experience of &quot;once but never again&quot;. If you are going to SF, there must be better options out there in the same pricerange with better service."
172,2030,"Nov 2 2007	rude wannabees!!!	Don't waste your time going to the Cliff Hotel! We went there during our anniversary and walked out in disbelief! Filled with too many wannabes, which will actually make you laugh. The staff, customers, everyone who was there...thought they were someone special. Try walking amongst the crowd, and they all stand there stiff and give you the hardest time to scoot through.Then the shocker...we wanted to take photos of the Red Room (the bar area) and the hostess told my husband that we cannot take any photos. He asked why and the hostess said &quot;to respect our celebrity guests.&quot; Although, she told us that we could take pictures of each other. So guess what...that's exactly what we did. My husband said to me &quot;All right, you go stand over there and I'll take a photo of you.&quot; Then, we switched places AND LENS (ha) and I took photos of him. The hostess, obviously a little upset that we were able to get around their stupid rule of NO PHOTOS, got on the phone to say something to either a manager or who knows. After taking photos, my husband then asked the hostess &quot;what celebrity is here that you're trying to respect their privacy?&quot; The honest responded &quot;no one.&quot; Then, my husband responded &quot;well if you think we are eager in taking photos of your wannabe customers, please...&quot; We then started to walk out to finish our overpriced drinks in the lobby. I was done with my drink, he had a few sips left in his. Low and behold, we were approached by a staff member saying &quot;you CANNOT have your drinks out here in the lobby!&quot; My quick response &quot;Uh, they are empty.&quot; My husband's response &quot;Yeah they are empty, what do you want us to do carry them back for you?&quot; Ha, she didn't like that response very much.My husband and I are from Dallas, we see way more celebrities, much better boutique hotels and top notch customers who truly &quot;ARE&quot; someone. You can even finish your drinks in the hotel lobby if you'd like. So, don't waste your time going to the Wannabe Hotel...a.k.a. The Cliff. You'll be standing there looking around at all the customers and asking yourself &quot;why they are dressed they way they are (fashion gone really really bad).&quot; Then, you will be waiting for Ashton Kutcher to walk out and say &quot;okay you've been punked,&quot; as this hotel scene is one big joke! But do remember how to get around taking photos at this stupid place that won't let you. Straight from the hostess mouth:TAKE PHOTOS OF YOURSELVES!your welcome!"
173,2030,"Oct 21 2007 	cool and chic but missing a little something	We stayed at the Clift hotel at the end of our road trip around California. On arrival we were greeted by friendly door staff and a competent reception. When you walk into the lobby of the hotel it is very impressive and gives the impression of a chic trendy hotel.We stayed in a delux room on the 6th floor of the hotel. This gave us a slightly larger room and more storage space than a standard room. The room its self is nicely designed with a very comfortable bed. However it did let its self down on the final touches with a tv cabinet that didnt fit the style and tiny t.v, the bedside tables also were a little worn. The hotel its self is a few minutes walk from union square and is in an excellent location. I note from previous posts that people felt unsafe the area, I have to say we never had any problems what so ever.The hotel bar appears to be very popular and is very busy on a weekend and also quite pricey! However its a cool place to get a drink before you go out.Be warned that you may have to show your room card to gain entry to the hotel of a night and they appeared quite strict about this. They could do with a seperate guest entry.Overall this hotel would suit people who enjoy staying at modern contemporary hotels, however at times it does feel that style is placed over substance here."
174,2030,"Oct 20 2007 	Simply loved the Clift!	If you ever spend some time in San Francisco, you have to stay at the Clift. Besides the fact that the Hotel is right in the center of everything (union square), its service and amenities are simply great. My boyfriend and I stayed there for two night and were overwhelmed of the special style of the Hotel.The rooms are comfortably furnished (I LOVED the bed..) and very very clean. If you're lucky like us, you get a room on one of the upper floors where the rooms are bigger. Make sure not to stay next to the elevator, it's a bit noisy. The service was also perfect. The people at the front desk are very friendly and helpful, but in a very natural way. They help you in everything and whenever they can. You simply feel welcome, and it was a very good feeling.Please make sure to have dinner at the Asia de Cuba. The dinner we had was so tasty and creative, real fusion, but also light cuisine. It's a bit pricy but it's definitely worth it to make your stay at the Clift complete.All in all I can say is that I was really sad when I left San Francisco, not only because I liked San Francisco, but also because I loved the Clift!! I hope I can go there again as soon as possible."
175,2030,"Oct 10 2007 	Sleek and stylish hotel	A friend booked us into the Clift for a night as a surprise. What a treat!This is a very swish and stylish hotel, designed by Phillip Starck. The room itself was a small suite; very calm, modern and comfortable in design. It had some nice luxuries like a CD player, huge TV and thick lustrous curtains.Designwise, downstairs is more exciting. The wood panelled Redwood Bar on the ground floor is amazing, made (I believe) from a single tree it is dark and atmospheric. In fact, darkness seemed to be a design theme running through other areas such as the corridors. The bar, dispensing excellent if pricey cocktails, is all lit up and the art on the walls is very cool and contemporary - video screens that on our visit were showing photographic portraits that if you watched closely you would see move now and then.It's a pricey place though, and I'm not sure that the extra money really buys you anything more than some nice design. Breakfast wasn't included, nor was there any gym or spa to use."
176,2030,"Oct 9 2007 	An absolute must!!	My husband and I stayed here and we can honestly say it was the best hotel experience we have ever had (and we have stayed in a fair few!)The service is fantastic- the staff cannot do enough to help and really go out of their way to make your stay special.We booked a delux room but got upgraded to a suite which was amazing- huge and beautiful throughout with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was not huge but that is the only slightly negative thing I could say, at a push!The whole hotel it immaculate inside- beautifully done and the Redwood Room (bar) is definitely a must.PLEASE READ THIS AND STAY THERE!!!"
177,2030,"Oct 8 2007 	Untraditional Hotel	We just returned from a trip to SF and stayed at the Clift. Reason being, it was difficult to get any hotels at all in the union square area, and not knowing how close all the neighborhoods are to one another, we didn't want to be stuck in an area we couldn't walk around in. The premise to stay in this area is so that you can easily walk the neighborhoods and get around easily . See more about this at the end of this review...for now, pros and consPros: close to theatres, chinatown, within walking distance or trolley or bus to wharf, north beach, telegraph hill, etc.People were VERY nice - our experience was not that they were snooty. Concierge and front desk arranged for rental car once we were leaving the area to drive down the coast, restaurant recommendations, etc.Bartender not as friendly but servers very friendly and we received fast service in the bar which is where we ate. Bar very trendy, great people watching - this is a great place where many trendies go. 20-30 somethings love this place.Very unique experience - most hotels are all alike in many ways; this hotel truly stands out as unique.Business center costs 6.95 to use internet for 15 minutes; but it's a cool area with lots of plasma tvs.Good workout area.Cons: the room details listed by other reviewers I'm in agreement on; no coffee makers or water in the room is just silly - and none even in the lobby. Nowhere to put stuff! shelves in bathroom are workable, but really not much room to move.Nowhere to put stuff - for extended stays, crowded and no drawers.For the more mature traveler, or business traveler, it may be too different - and trendiness versus value overall won't win.For the money, the value just isn't here. Additional:This is in the theatre district, but the other districts are within a block of this - so very easy to get around. But you really want to be walking versus taking cabs in this central area of theatre, financial, shopping, chinatown...because there is a lot of traffic here like many downtown areas.Very casual everyplace - you can dress up or down, mostly casual."
178,2030,"Oct 8 2007	uber chic ?	this hotel is so chic is hurts the bar area seems to be packed everynight with locals it seems as if they have spent all the money on the bar/night club area the receptionst were freindly but messed up our reservation completely . The hotel is fairly central but next to two theatres which causes problems getting back to the hotel if you time it wrong. Room was basic and no little touches ( coffee maker, water etc ) out of the 3 night we stayed we had choclotes on our pillow once. ok stay wouldn't stay there again fair nicer hotels available for the money"
179,2030,"Sep 23 2007 	Not all that great and too expensive	The hotel looks like a club when you come in. The Reception and lobby area is dark and decorated with a lot of wood and concrete (in a good way). The hallway's are purple the elevators all have a different colour and there's a constant funky music in the reception, lobby, and even in the elevators.The rooms are small and decorated with big mirrors in front and behind the bed. The colours used are interesting as well partialy purple walls and furniture and orange cubic bed stands. Personally i didn't like it. The bathroom is really small. The closet is a doorhole with a shelf and somekind of small trendy drawer. not all that functional.The Bar is decorated completly in wood and is really nice. Especially the living portraits. If you want to sit down it's going to cost you a pricy bottle of liquer and you need to reserve.The restaurant looks nice and they offer pricy fushion food which you are supposed to share amongst the able. The food is good but the service not. The waiting time is long as well.Another interesting feature is the week-end transformation. The bar one of the town's hotspots and people stand in line to get in. The doormen change in bouncers and if you forget your roomkey you have a hard time getting in. don't use the valet parking. there's a number of public parking places nearby and they are much cheaper. The only good thing about the clift is the location, everything else is overrated."
180,2030,"Sep 19 2007 	Avoid the Clift Hotel	The Clift Hotel is the worst place I have stayed in San Francisco. - Arrive after 8pm and stand in line to get questioned by the doorman/bouncer. The trendy restaurant and bar flow over to the Hotel Lobby so I understand why; but not cool after finishing a day of meetings. Do not stay here unless you are here to party and do not feel can make it across the street to any of the nearby hotels.- Washroom was super small. The toilet is up against the mirror and drains do not work well.- Want to watch a little TV before bed? Bring your binoculars for the in-room 19inch tube tv!Fancy soap, nice sheets, paper thin walls; so do expect to hear what you neighbors are up to."
181,2030,"Sep 15 2007 	Incongruent design	The Clift was marketed as a 4-star boutique hotel in downtown SF. It was indeed downtown and had all the hallmarks of a funky boutique hotel, but 4-star? Absolutely not.The lobby was darkly decorated with rich wood, a huge (and I mean HUGE) sitting chair - I think you needed a small ladder to get on the seat - lots of couches and a friendly staff, but there was no doorman there when we arrived at 5:30 PM on a Friday night.As we checked in, no offer of a bellman to get our bags to our room and when we entered the elevator, it was like the twilight zone. The first elevator we rode on was mirrored on the inside with red mirrors. Dizzying, in my opinion, especially when we stepped off the elevator on our floor to a vague lavender colour. Other elevators were blue mirrors and green mirrors. Oy.Our room was a lovely corner room, very small, but we were mindful of the fact that this was an OLD hotel property (I think it was originally a Four Seasons hotel) and the rooms from that grand era are much smaller than today. The furniture was blond wood and modern and someone had seen fit to paint a flourescent coral color on the underneath of the furniture to give it a &quot;glow&quot;. All well and good, except the paint was peeling off.The bathroom was fully mirrored (but in regular plain mirrors rather than the colored mirrors of the elevator, thank God!) and it gave a nice bright feel. The provided toiletries were fabulous - basil lemon (I think!) bar soap in a cool plastic case, shower gel, and so on.We went to dinner and a show in the Mission District and when we returned to the hotel after midnight, the doorman had finally appeared and wasn't going to let us in without our key, even though there was a super-packed bar scene happening right beyond the lobby. I guess our Mission District casual outfits wouldn't have passed muster in the bar and we were only let in because we both produced a room key.Check out was quick and painless, no weird charges we had to dispute, and again, friendly staff at the counter.Overall, definitely a three-star but in no one way does it come close to the four-star it was marketed as."
182,2030,"Sep 11 2007 	All fur and no knickers	For the final leg of our honeymoon we decided to stay at The Clift in San Francisco. We expected a chi-chi designer hotel and certainly from the lobby/reception areas it is impressive (also very very dark). On arrival the receptionist was precise and quick, less hospitable than the other hotels we'd stayed at for sure.We got to our room and saw what we expected. Small city centre hotel with a tiny bathroom. However what did make us slightly sad was the tiredness of the room. It certainly has not been touched since its conversation by Starck and Shrager. Minimalist to the letter, there were no frills associated with any other 5* hotel. Everything had to be paid for. The TV was a let down (sad I know to have to comment on this). It was an old school Philips 20inch TV - probably the same age as the hotel. Most good quality hotels - particularly those who consider themselves 5* and boutique would have had a plasma and not a 'box' in a console (also containing the mini-bar).The bathroom was obviously the original from the Clift but I can accept that although the chic bowl and stand table didn't fit with the vintage bath, tiles and toilet fixtures. Seems to me to be a lot of laziness in terms of trying to finish the job off.Linens were soft and comfortable but the towels were appalling. Pulled threads and worn out in places. Not what you would expect.Staff were reasonably polite and helpful (although it wasn't clear who was operating the concierge but then I didn't ask at first).Asia de Cuba was a success, although we were informed that portions were large and were recommended to choose just one appetiser and one entree. Not a problem if you both eat meat/fish but if you don't then the meat eater could get left out. Best bet is to order 2/3 appetisers instead. The carrot cake was amazing also but enough for 3 people!! Our meal including two glasses of wine each plus water and coffee is $168.00 which isn't that bad compared with UK prices. But choose wisely..The Redwood Room was avoided on Friday and Saturday due to the number of people in there (mainly external I believe). I think this is where the hotel lets its guests down, it doesn't provide a private residents bar which it should considering its status and price.Overall it was okay but not worth visiting again. I've stayed in hotels all over Europe and also the Bellagio and Loews. The Clift needs to revisit its guest experience in my opinion."
183,2030,"Sep 6 2007 	Cool hotel Great location	Stayed at the Clift for a girlfriends weekend getaway... Very speedy and nice front check in experience. The doormen were also great at getting us car service quickly.We stayed on the 14th floor- it was quiet and our rooms had decent views. I thought the room decoration was simple and clean.The decor in the front lobby is very cool and funky. We also came back late one evening and hung out in the packed bar- Redwood Room. We had table service and the waitress was a bit snooty- I didn't care for her. Overall, the bar was quite trendy and fun but be prepared to drop a few bucks on drinks....try the lavendar lemondrop martini...it's good stuff.I would stay here again and recommend it to friends that wanted to stay in a busier trendy spot on a city getaway. It was just a few minutes walking to Union Square, good restaurants and a ton of shopping nearby."
184,2030,"Sep 4 2007 	Horrible Experience Rude Staff Not at ALL worth it....	This was my first experience using travelocity and decided to take a chance and book a little getaway for the Labor Day weekend. Since I used to live in SF and travel their quite frequently for work, I am quite familiar with the city and knew we would want to stay in union square (as my boyfriend has never been there and this is the best &quot;touristy&quot; spot). I usually prefer to stay at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin St. Francis but both were overbooked. I was left with the Clift and Hotel Nikko. I definiately made the wrong choice even though I had heard good things about the lounge and restaurant. Since I have stayed at the Morgan (NYC) several times I assumed we would have a pleasant experience and I LOVE Asia de Cuba in NYC. I was wrong!  When we arrived at the Clift, the doorman did not even open the door or even aknowledge our pressence. Check-in was smooth but the girl was certainly rushing us and annoyed with any questions. Our original plan was to spend our first night with dinner at Asia De Cuba and start off with some early evening cocktails at the Redwood Room. BIG MISTAKE. Upon check-in we asked if we needed reservations for the Redwood Room. The girl gave us some &quot;preferred customer&quot; cards of some sort which she explained would get us right in with no problem. We approached the hostess at about 730 pm. There were a couple of guys in front of us whom the hostess was assisting. As we patiently waited, a large group came up behind us. The matron of the group approached the hostess - cutting in front of everyone else AND interrupting the conversation between the hostess and the 2 guys. Rather than telling this RUDE woman to go stand in line actually assisted her! The guys in front of us looked apalled and we were infuriated. Once it was finally our turn (like that mattered to the hostess) she very rudely told us we couldnt come in without a reservation. She said she had people arriving at 9 pm. We explained we just wanted ONE pre-dinner cocktail. At this point she got even more rude. At this point we decided this was NOT a place we wanted to spend out money anyways. They obviously dont care about their actual guests! The scene was horrible anyways. I dont think there was a patron under the age of 65 in the entire bar.... so much for a &quot;hip&quot; bar scene. We tried to complain to a manager but he was too busy having a personal conversation with one of the doormen. We decided our money is better spent elsewhere and opted against dinner in the hotel. We had a lovely meal in the Marina district then went on to drinks at Matrix where our patronage was appreciated and our drinks were not accompanied with a side of rudeness. I might also point out the martinis are $8 at Matrix as opposed to the overpriced drinks Redwood Room with serve you along with their snooty attitude. We are from LA so we are no strangers to attitude but this was just plain RUDE.  Aside from the horrible experience our first night, the hotel lobby is quite nice. The rooms are VERY small and somewhat dirty. The bathroom is appalling - dirty towels, the fan doesnt work, no standing room. On our final day, the anger from night one had worn off slightly (probably because we spent as little time in the hotel as possible). We were packing our stuff and relaxing from a morning of shopping. The day before, housekeeping entered our room even though we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door. Since nothing was taken we ignored it. Now here we are, a mere hour from escaping the Clift, when there is a knock at the door...housekeeping. I explain we are leaving at 1 (check out time) and to please respect the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign. 15 minutes later, another knock at the door. It is the housekeeper AGAIN. I tell her &quot;we are still here&quot; and remind her of our departure time. Sure enough, another knock at the door and who could it be? The SAME housekeeper. At this point we are so frustrated my boyfriend tells her to wait outside and we gather all our stuff (half packed and all). They clearly wanted us gone so we sprinted to the elevator checked out and left the Clift behind.  Trust me, the Clift offers NOTHING to validate such horrible attitudes and behavior. I had high hopes for this place and if they had impressed me, I would have considered staying there on my monthly business trips up to SF. Forget it. I will definately tell everyone I know NOT to stay here and I will probably never stay at the Morgan again either just because of the Clift affiliation. Trust me, you are better off at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin. At least they know you exist there and are gracious for your patronage. My advice to the Clift, perhaps you should remember that you are serving your guests not vice versa. Thank you for putting a stain on an otherwise lovely trip."
185,2030,"Sep 2 2007	Really nice great location!	Its a trendy hotel, a real beauty on the inside. Great bar scene, and the food was great too. The rooms are nice, great views, and a comfy bed. The TV was horrible, just 12 inches...they said they are working on that aspect. Morgans Hotels are fun and hip. You can't go wrong. Breakfast staff and waiters in Asia De Cuba were amazing!"
186,2030,"Sep 1 2007 	Great Hotel and Service	My husband and I just got back from San Francisco where we stayed at the Clift hotel. We had an excellent time and can't say enough good things about the hotel and the service we received. The first night at the hotel we couldn't sleep because there was a service elevator next to our room which was loud and kept us up all night. We called front desk in the morning and they switched us to another beautiful room later that day. The hotel is well situated near Union Sq. and close to the public transit. The hotel is very clean and friendly staff. We especially recommend talking to Steve the concierge. He was so helpful in recommending great restaurants and things to do around San Francisco. He also recommended that instead of taking an organized tour of the Napa Valley like my husband and I wanted to do, he arranged a car rental for us and gave us great driving directions to go there on our own. That was really the high light of our trip. He made our own little itinerary so we were able to see the vineyards we wanted to see and even made lunch reservations at a wonderul restaurant for us. Overall great service!"
187,2030,Aug 29 2007 	If you like the W you'll love the Clift!	Trendy and hip hotel. It is the coolest place I have ever stayed. Great hotel room views of the city and funky amenities. The bar downstairs is smoking hot! A must see and very memorable place.
188,2030,"Aug 26 2007	Excellent Location Beautiful but Not Worth The Money	Clift is a very beautiful hotel -- the lobby is stunning, the furniture is gorgeous, the elevators are sexy, I loved the periwinkle and silver decorations and thought the hotel room was very pretty. The location was terrific -- great restaurants within steps from the hotel, excellent shopping. Great front desk service. That said, I did not think it was worth the near $400 we paid for the night. The bed was not very comfortable although the room was quiet. It was our first trip to San Francisco and I'm glad we stayed there, but next time we'll probably look for a hotel that places more emphasis on comfort than style."
189,2030,Aug 24 2007 	Nightclub posing as a 4 star hotel	The hotel itself was gorgeous. The staff was superb. The room was nice although we did pay a upgrade fee of $75 a night as the room with priceline was only 260 sq feet. There is no coffee maker in room. The television is tiny. No pool. You must call for ice and sometimes it can take over 30 minutes to be delivered. The room service prices are unreal- $18 for a hamburger. Internet service ($10 a night) is from noon to noon. Unlike other places where it is a 24 hour period. Parking will run you $45 a night plus a $6 parking tax fee.For luxury I would say this is not a 4 star hotel such as the Hyatt or Hilton. It felt like a nightclub with a hotel attached. The bar is PACKED most nights and the crowd lingers into the small lobby.I would not stay here again.
190,2030,"Aug 24 2007 	Attitude at the Clift	Upon arrival at the Clift, we were embarrassed at the behavior of the desk clerk, who VERY loudly announced, to all around, that we were lucky that we got the room we got, because we were booked by Priceline. This incident was shortly followed by the concierge, who, while starting to advise us, took a call and proceeded to help the person on the line, rather than to explain that he was in the middle of helping a guest, and getting back to that person. THEN, we decided to eat dinner at Asia de Cuba, which is in the hotel, and got a really snotty attitude from the hostess! The dinner was great, though. In addition to all of this, the room was lacking any place to unpack, or set things down in the bathroom. We felt it a rather inhospitable stay. As far as we were concerned, the only people who would enjoy this place are those that enjoy being abused!"
191,2030,"Aug 14 2007 	no way !	325 usd room only rate for so small rooms and dirty towels ! no way ! we stayed at san martins lane at london and enjoyed a lot , that's way we choose to stay another ian shragger hotel in sf . sorry but even Asia de Cuba was a failure . dont stay there if you are a couple and if you have more than 2 luggages . the only nice thing was the famous &quot;redwood room bar&quot; which was packed every night and has a great ambiance. location is great but again there are many other alternatives in the same area."
192,2030,"Aug 10 2007	Location! Location! Location!	Had a very satisfactory result from first-ever Priceline bid on a 4-star hotel in SF Union Square West area - estimated savings of $75-$100 on the &quot;standard&quot; 2-queen room rate. The Clift is practically next door to Curran Theatre, about two blocks west of Union Square on Geary. Every staff person (from housekeeping to front desk) with whom we had contact was friendly, professional and accommodating. We loved the contemporary decor. One whimsical, huge, armchair in the lobby HAD to be photographed - &quot;And that's the truth (insert raspberry cheer here)&quot;, in the words of a Lily Tomlin character!We enjoyed our 4-day girl's getaway in the great city by the bay and left more than our hearts there - some stress, some $, etc!Only minor complaints about little space of shelving/storage (in bathroom especially) or drawers, and no in-room coffee maker. Storage would have been sufficient for any one person."
193,2030,Aug 10 2007 	Absolutely Fabulous.Wonderful Hotel-	Just returned from this beautiful Hotel. The staff are probably the most courteous and friendliest staff I have ever encountered. The Hotel is a delight and has to be seen. Beauty is everywhere from the display of white tulips at reception to the whimsical furniture.The bedrooms delight with lovely colours and white linens. I was nervous after reading the comments on tripdvisor . Now I will be booking the Hotel directly for visits to Sf. I would NOT stay anywhere else.
194,2030,"Aug 6 2007 	Will not return	We were given a room where the fan did not work in the bathroom. When we complained we were given another room where the fan did not work in the bathroom. Not my idea of good service.We were told that parking would be $45/night. What they charged us when we checked out was $65/night and I had to point out to them that they had double charged us on one night. Clearly nobody reviewed the bill. Furthermore, I was woken up early in the morning as my bill was slipped under the door. Something that I found be completely unacceptable.It is not a well run hotel, nor do they go out of their way to make one comfortable. They nickel dime you on every little charge. I don't mind paying for service or goods, but I do mind hidden charges and paying for services that I do not get. For instance the internet connection.The internet connection in the rooms was faulty and had a very slow data rate. I stayed in 2 rooms and they both had this problem. I was on a business trip and it was easier for me to go find a cafe and pay for an internet connection there. That stung as I like to work in my hotel room and I had already paid the clift for an internet connection. Also, on the morning I left, the Internet access was shut off hours before checkout time.Given the internet shutoff, the housekeeping coming by as I was in the shower, and the charge sheet unceremoniously shoved under the door in the early morning, I felt as though I was being shoved out the door. Not what one expects from a civilized hotel.I found the hotel to be cold and impersonal with poorly trained staff. No water or ice was available in the rooms. The rooms were tiny. The bar downstairs is full of 20 something heavy drinkers who tend to cluster outside the front door and smoke. It is not a pleasant atmosphere. There are many really nice hotels in San Francisco and in my opinion this one is second rate at best. I would not recommend it. There are better hotels right down the street that charge less."
195,2030,"Jul 26 2007 	Best hotel in SF!	I spend a lot of time in the Bay area primarily for business and have tried most of the usual suspects but keep coming back to the Clift time and time again. It's the service that makes me want to return--from the moment I am greeted at my car by the folks working the door who are very friendly and charming (not to mention easy on the eyes!) to check-in and room service, I know I'm going to have a top-notch stay at the Clift every time! The room amenities are the best I've found in the city; Ian Schraeger-designed so you know they'll be visually interesting and appealing to most, plenty of space, ambiance lighting, candles, outrageously comfortable beds, lots of bathroom counter/shelf space, Frette robes... nothing is left to spare! And the Redwood Room is always a good time, too! In all, this is the best stay in SF and definitely worth the price of admission. (PS--remember if you're parking a car to call downstairs in advance and you'll have no worries at all!)"
196,2030,"Jul 24 2007	not worth it.	I recently had my parents stay here and I spent an evening there with them. Sure, the place is incredibly well designed and quite pleasant to look at. However, their fitness area stinks and there is no spa.Our room bordered on shoebox size. for the price, do yourself a favor and stay at the W or even the Huntington, where you have a few extra luxuries. The bar is gorgeous and definitely worth a stop but drinks are in the $14 a drink range and service is less than superior. The restaurant is also lacking on many levels. I felt that we were ripped off and would not stay there again.This hotel is no longer an Ian Schrager property and having been to his new gramercy park hotel, it sure does show."
197,2030,"Jul 23 2007 	Clift is funky	My wife and I just got back from a 3 night stay at the Clift. We loved it. Keep in mind that we got a great deal on this hotel using Priceline ($150 a night). If we had paid list prices for the hotel, I think we would have been disappointed. The theme is funky and contemporary....from the lobby, elevators, hallways, and then into the rooms themselves. We thought it was pretty cool. We read a ton of reviews on this site and the only negative thing that often gets pointed out were the size of the bathroom, they are TINY! There is litterally about a 1 foot by 2 foot area to stand on in the bathroom itself, thats it. We found the conceirge, front desk staff and doormen to be attentive and accomodating. We also found time to visit the Redwood Room for a drink or 2. The place was happening and very trendy. Expect to pay about $13-15 for you trendy drink however. My wife and I are in our mid 30's, and we would definately stay their again, but only by using Priceline. We wouldn't have been too happy to pay $300 + rack rates that appear on their website. This was out first time to SF, and the location could not have been better. It seemed to be right in the middle of everything"
198,2030,"Jul 22 2007 	Cold Dark and Grey	Booked this hotel on the basis of it's 5* rating and location close to Union Square. First impression of the lobby area was cold dark and seedy. The remainder of the hotel, lifts, corridors and rooms continued the cold theme with primarily grey colors everywhere supplemented with dim lighting and over use of air conditioning. Not for the depressive!. Bed was very comfortable, rooms and bathroom very clean and well stocked. Breakfast room very cold in appearace and temperature and seemed more like a seedy (cold) night club. Breakfast quality was good but expensive. Internet usage expensive with printing charged at 7.50 extra per page!!. In summary, good location but don't go if you expect warm, bright and luxurious surroundings."
199,2030,"Jul 5 2007 	ZERO CLASS - Front Desk agents	Booked my stay at Clift via word of mouth of a co-worker. Was expecting something great - stylish and unique. What I got was the COMPLETE opposite. 1. The DoorMen were HORRID. They cared more about talking amongst themselves and I even had to open MY OWN DOOR while they completely disregaurded me. 2.Once I walked in to the dimley lit lobby (more like pitch black, although I will give it credit for creativity) I was appalled to have to wait for the Front Desk Clerk to even acknowledge me! And it was not bc there were other guests or even phone call duties. They were talking amongst themselves and laughing. I could not believe it and even expressed my disapoinment with my arrival. the clerk Terra i think just shrugged her shoulders and proceded with Check In. (Terrible service ) Could have at least apologized and made certain it was not a lasting impression.3.The rooms were EXTREMELY small and have NO dressers! I felt like i was back at my University Dorm Room! Please CLIFT get with the times! The Good: Redwood Room is alot of fun. But you are better off staying at ANOTHER hotel (with some CLASS) and just visiting the Redwood Room for a night.Overall my grief is not about the style of the hotel. I understand the Clift is not for everyone by way of their unique &quot;approach&quot; to what a hotel is...Its just I think they confuse what they should be doing with being CARLESS and treating the guests like they would their neighbor down the street. They have NO idea what class is! I blame the management for hiring these DUMB kids who have probably NEVER worked at a hotel before and dont get trained in how to (again) behave with class....MESSAGE TO ALL: DONT STAY AT CLIFT"
200,2030,"Jul 1 2007	Dark 	The Clift lobby was very dark and cool. Staff was always pleasant, but not overly friendly. The PYT's who double as doormen could stand to be a little more attentive (they often failed to open the doors and managed to hail a cab for us that would only go to Oakland - we were headed to Russian Hill!). The room we had was smallish, but not at all uncomfortable - mirrors almost everywhere helped to maintain the illusion the room was a little bigger than it was. The room was very clean, and the bed and pillows in particular, were super comfortable. Shower pressure and temperature were perfect - almost too powerful on both counts! And the toiletries provided smelled great and worked well. I'm still using the body milk and hoping to find something comparable.We were surprised the Clift charges $10 a day for internet for this high-end of a hotel. Room service is expected to be exhorbitant - but still was much more than expected with extra fees tacked on.The location was great though - everywhere we wanted to go was easily accessed on foot or nearby public transportation. I'd be happy to stay at the Clift again."
201,2030,"Jun 29 2007 	Staff's attitude overshadows beautifully designed hotel	The hotel is typical Ian Shrager, very unique design with attention to detail. Morgan hotel is nyc has anice design as well but less attitude so I wasnt expecting that form the san fran location. The rooms are a little small but thats expected. The bar is gorgeous and asia de cuba is good and a nice touch to addition to the hotel for its convenience. .The hotel staff under whelms the design of the hotel. I wont characterize all of the doormen as euro-jerks as some (the guys in the morning) are very nice and helpful. The night crew are horrible. One particular individual (moron with the pony tail) is too cool (or at least he thinks he is) to do anything and he seems to go out of his way to be rude to guests and non guests. I dont expect much out of doormen other than opening the door but this guy goes out of his way not to open it or not to answer any questions or get a cab. He has more of a bouncer attitude than he does a helpful doormen. I walked in with an older couple in front of me and he asked if they were staying at the hotel. He was embarrassed when they said yes we have a suite here you idiot. I laughed. The bartenders arent much better (guy with the shaved head on Wednesdays needs to get a clue) Too cool to serve people drinks (other than girls with big boobs). Drinks are expensive ($8 beers/$16 martinis)) but you are paying for the bar which is very nicely designed. Front desk is hit or miss. Check in was good and check out was painful. Ian shrager should put as much work on the hotel staff attitude as he does in his design and he would have a 5 star hotel instead of a 2 star hotel because of the attitude of the select few.I wouldnt go back to the clift as there are plenty of other hotels that are just as nice without the attitude."
202,2030,"Jun 28 2007 	Satisfied at the Clift	Beautiful public spaces with an active nightlife in the &quot;Redwood Room&quot; on the weekends. The interior design in the rooms is well thought out, chic and minimal, but not updated since the 90's it appears. However, the rooms are in good condition and have been well maintained. The staff was friendly and helpful at all times. This hotel was a good deal for what we paid (@ $190/night) on Travelocity. I would definitely stay here again."
203,2030,"Jun 26 2007 	Fantastic Hotel Fantastic Staff!!!	My wife and I stayed at the Clift Hotel Friday June 22 through Monday June 25. After reading some of the reviews here I had mixed feelings about the hotel. I even went as far as contacting the assistant manager with some of my concerns and she (Jenny) put me at ease. We stayed in room 419 and even though it was a bit small it was VERY clean. The size of the room didn't bother us since we are rarely in the room when we travel. The bathrooms are tiny, but we expected that from a hotel in the middle of a large city. The decor is awesome, not your traditional stuffy hotel it is very hip and chic. The hotel staff was more welcoming than some other hotels I have visited. The doormen that have been talked about so much on this site were there the entire weekend. We did occasionally have to open our own door when they were helping others into a cab or helping someone with directions, no biggie. We asked for a late checkout and they accomodated us without any problems. Overall, I think this is a great hotel in a great location! I booked this hotel online and got a great rate, next time we are in SF we will definitely stay here again. Thanks"
204,2030,"Jun 22 2007	Great Location	I surprised my husband with a trip to SF to see his beloved Giants at a home game. I picked this hotel especially for it's boutique, masculine decor and feel. It is personally not my taste--I prefer more comfy decor and setting--but right up my hubby's alley. The doormen were helpful and would direct us to great places to eat, things to see and would flag down taxi's for us. We had drinks in the bar at around 9pm and you could see the &quot;young, hip crowd&quot; in the bar and it got crowded. The rooms are very small. We had a room on the 4th floor, there was some noise from the street below, but what can you expect when you're staying in a hotel in the middle of the city? The beds were comfortable and clean. The bathrooms were tiny! You could barely fit one person in there! Location is great! You walk out your door and you are steps from shopping, trollies, taxi's or whatever you need. I would not recommend this hotel to families or people who prefer more luxurious accomodations. Overall, it was a good experience."
205,2030,"Jun 21 2007 	Attitude	We, a family of 4, have stayed at the Clift regularly for 3 years and greatly enjoyed its location, decor, and friendly staff. This March I tried to make a reservation to stay in our favorite suite and I was told that they do not and have never allowed 4 people to stay together in a suite. The reservations agent continued to insist that this was true even when I told her we had stayed there numerous times in the past and that she could look this up in her records. I asked if it were possible to take two rooms or two adjoining rooms. She made no effort to be helpful or explain the situation or call for a manager. I am appalled they would treat any potential guest with this attitude, much less a previous customer. We will not try again. I am writing this review 3 months later because it still irks me!"
206,2030,"Jun 19 2007 	Mixed.	We just spent three days at the Clift and found the experience mixed. The good:1. Location--can't be beat.2. Front desk crew--helpful and friendly.3. Bed and bed linens--comfy.The OK:1. Lobby decor2. Doormen--friendly enough, but rarely open the door for you.The bad:1. Lighting--terrible in the lobby and in the rooms. Hard to even read.2. Storage--essentially none. They use funny plastic cubes as nightstands and have no dresser available.3. Room size. Pretty small for a good hotel. SMALL bathroom.3. Charge for internet service."
207,2030,"Jun 6 2007 	What happens fashion designersma	When we checked into the Clift, the clerk said we were lucky to be staying with them at all for &quot;this rate&quot;. Then he proceded to tell us we would be disappointed in the room if we didn't upgrade to a better room at a much higher price. All this before he gave us the key.The hotel is poorly lit to conceal its age, blemishes and cleanliness. Where the Clift gets off calling itself a &quot;jet set&quot; hotel I'll never know. I've stayed in Dubai, London and Gstaad and I know where the jet set resides - and it ain't places like this. I'd recommend thee Clift for people who spend a lot of time watching MTV and haven't the faintest clue what class is."
208,2030,"Jun 3 2007 	Never a dull moment at the Clift	Ask for David, the Guest Experience Manager. San Francisco for Saint Patrick's is a blast in North Beach. The Clift still has the most international, dressed up crowd."
209,2030,"Jun 2 2007 	The Clift is OVER RATED!	The Clift is definitely over rated. As mentioned on several other reviews, the doormen are lazy and worthless. I'd fire them because the only thing worse than a guest opening the doors themselves is opening the doors while a stylish guy in a pony tail stands there and watches. No help at all with the baggage. How does that add into a five star rating?The bathrooms are horrible. The marble flooring is scuffed and stained and looked dirty even after a visit from housekeeping. And small! I have never seen a smaller bathroom. There is little or no space for any personal toiletries at all!The rooms are cold and very univiting. Ol' Phillipe S. may have been going for the celestial cloud crap, but itcame off as cold and uninviting. The bed was horrible as well. I'll take a Westin pillow top bed any time over the lumpy bed we had at the Clift.And why can't they find room in the rooms for a dresser? We were here for three nights and lived out of the suitcase because there was no dresser. There was a nice sized closet, that handled hanging clothes, and a K-Mart college dorm style open shelf unit in the closet, but It would be nice to have a dresser!I've stayed here before, and well before the remodling, and I will not try it again. I prefer the Fairmont or ANY Westin over the Clift. The Clift is not a comfortable place to stay. I do not care who designed it, why he designed it that way, of who loves his design. Obviously the hoel management does and the drop his name in every review response. Also the other reviewers mentioned high room service charges, I agree 15% gratutity, 5% surcharge and then a $3.50 delivery charge. All to get a VERY overpriced room meal. I walked to Starbucks every day and was glad I did. Overall not a bad hotel but 5 star? Please!"
210,2030,May 22 2007 	Not thtat good	Clift Hotel very stark with little warmth or ambiance. Rooms are small. Staff friendly and helpfull. Would not go back
211,2030,"May 20 2007 	Smallest bathroom....	OK. so why do they keep these Morgan places so dark?? The stylish lobby and the bar are almost over done...the location is good (but on the edges), the rooms are indeed small, the views narrow airshafts and dull brick buildings...(higher floors excepted)...the rooms designed for photographs, but not living in, there are NO drawers...NONE, if using desk, can't get by to rest of room, small tv, and the worst, the smallest bathrooms I've met, with too much furniture in odd locations, we moved ours into room..better, no relaxing soaks in the mini tub either...There are, however, redeeming aspects: the bar is great, the restaurant is good, the beds are super and the staff in particular accomodating and helpful...the place is well kept and very clean. Would we stay again, well we were in a Superior rm 315 sq ft king sleigh bed tub and shower dvd cd high ceiling room...if we had the $$$ the suites are fun and interesting and the big suite (the apartment) is GREAT...All in all, I'll try another place next trip...at $300+ per night...there has to be a better place"
212,2030,"May 18 2007 	Ridiculously overpriced	Stayed at Hotel Clift 2 nights. First, i had a very good impression: the lobby and decoration are really great. Then i saw my room. Small, basic, dull, no equipement in particular. I had cookies from the minibar that were stale for over 4 months. My laundry cost me half of the purchase price of my clothes and turned out poorly ironed. Breakfast is expensive and as limited as a few croissants and fruit juice. I never could speak to the reception without queuing 10 minutes. All in all, go there for drinks, not for staying!"
213,2030,May 18 2007 	Excellent!!!	My partner &amp; I arrived at The Clift after a long flight from London...... The hotel is very stylish &amp; not over designed...... Check in was fast and efficient. and the staff charming.......We had a beautiful room on the top floor....... and the view was wonderful...... The room we stayed in was certainly not tiny and was spotlessly clean. I must say the chambermaids do a very thorough job!The hotel bar do wonderful cocktails &amp; it is a great place to observe people....... Breakfast was good. The concierge was great at suggesting restaurants &amp; making reservations........The walls are thin.... so yes you can hear the person in the room next to you.......But overall ......... we had a wonderful stay @ The Clift and will definitely return.
214,2030,"May 14 2007 	Pass on this hotel	We stayed at the Clift hotel for 5 nights in May, 2007. The decor is interesting and funky. The rooms are very small and as has been mentioned, the bathrooms are extra small. Most rooms have only a closet to store your clothing. Each room is slightly different, but the purple, cream and orange tones seem to be consistent. We enjoyed the decor, but the rooms are very noisy. You can literally hear the people speaking next door and no, they don't have to be loud. This is one of the noisiest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in and we travel a lot.Unfortunately we had guests who despite being asked by hotel security to be quiet, continued to party well past 3am. Ear plugs don't do the trick. We asked for a room change. It was handled efficiently and because we didn't have guests staying beside us, our new room was quiet. The hotel staff were helpful in relocating us and in recommending restaurants and offering other suggestions. I didn't think they were as professional as one would expect in this class of hotel, but they got the job done. Eventually. The location is excellent and we felt very safe.I'll be back to SF, but I won't be staying here. I can't recommend it, even for a short stay."
215,2030,May 7 2007 	clift you made our first visit to the west coast complete	I can only cofirm what has been commented on on recent reports...the hotel is cool! Decor throughout was excellent... staff friendly and helpful and location excellent I certainly hope to revisit this hotel on my next visit to San francisco
216,2030,"May 4 2007 	Agressive Room Service	The hotel is super nice and cool, however the room service appears to be a bit agressive. During my two-week stay there I got two phone calls asking if I want my room cleaned. I was approached with the same question several times in front of the room door and on two occasions room service knocked on my door for the same purpose even with the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign hanging on the door. Once I noticed my room was cleaned in my absence even though that sign was posted and once the sheets were changed even though I had placed the be-eco-friendly-do-not-change-sheets label on my pillow.Furthermore the doors and walls are kind of thin so I had the pleasure of listening to the &quot;knock-knock-room-service&quot; routine being played on each door on my floor twice a day. Other reviewers have said the noise in that hotel is mostly from parties, however I think otherwise."
217,2030,"Apr 29 2007 	Love the CLIFT	Great service in a beautiful hotel. I travel regularly in the U.S. and Europe and I find this is one of the best hotels in which I have stayed. The service is consistently first rate by a very attentive staff. Everyone is super friendly, in person and on the phone. Theyve helped me with restaurant reservations, wine-tasting trips, spa reservations, and they do it with pleasure. Asia de Cuba, the restaurant, has great food, tending towards the deliciously exotic and the Redwood Room, which must be one of the most beautiful bars in the city, is a great place to have a drink and meet friends or co-workers.I come to San Francisco for work but staying at the Clift makes the trip seem more like pleasure.I'll definitely be back."
218,2030,"Apr 26 2007 	Honeymoon Heaven	We stayed at The Clift as part of our 3 stop USA Honeymoon ( Vegas &amp; NYC) The staff at The Clift are a credit to themselves and their hotel as they treated us like friends rather than just paying guests. Their counterparts at The Hudson in NYC should take a leaf from their training book. We were upgraded in advance (without asking) to suite 1533, a beautiful, bright and crisp corner room. The Clift is boutique and cool in style, the bar can be a bit dark and overpowering but worth a cocktail to people watch. Talking of that - have a look at the 'paintings' on the walls - very cool....The concierge dealt with our every need - travel advice, restaurant reservations, airport car, and even liasing with vegas with regards items left in our room there. We did not eat in the hotel as there is so much cool food in SF. A 'tourist' photo sitting in the big chair in the lobby is a must...but most imprtantly - experiencing The Clift is also a must. Excellent location - 1.5 blocks from Union Sq, close to tram/bus links. Professional and friendly service. Funky design but still very comfortable. Californian, laid back cooool.........We would go back in a heartbeat"
219,2030,"Apr 25 2007 	Very nice.	We just returned from a five day stay at the Clift. We are in are late 50's and very much enjoyed the hotel. Staff is very friendly and accomodating. Arrived late due to flight problems and check in was accomodating. We had Theater tickets so that was essential. Surprised to find Theater was virtually next door which gave us some crucial minutes. ctually spent very little time in the room which is typical for us so room size was not an issue. Room was very nice and comfortable. We do not expect or need an enormous room. We thought decor was interesting and different. Those complaining about city issues, it is to be expected, but not threatening in the least. Clift staff is always outside welcoming you. The Redwod Room is rather amazing. We got a very good deal on room which of course made a lot of difference."
220,2030,"Apr 7 2007 	Just returned from the Clift	My wife and I just returned from the wonderful city of San Francisco. If you have never gone, well worth the trip. Not a ton to do, but the ambiance and relaxed state of the city is soothing itself. Definitely check out the usual tourist traps (Alcatraz, Pier 39, Chinatown) and if you like art head over to the SFMOMA. There was gallery dedicated to Picasso's prevalent role in developing modern/post modern artists.So about this hotel..... First of all if you are going ask yourself some specific questions...1) am I looking for a hotel to be chic and attempting the cutting edge of design (trying to make an artistic statement)?if you could care less or are not impressed with this previous statement, you may not like the Clift Hotel. This hotel is just like its sister in South Beach, The Delano. It is a great scene to be scene, have an amazing night (Redwood Room) and eat a fantastic, yet expensive meal (Asia De Cuba). Overall, I really felt like this was a couples hotel, friends looking to get out and party around SF hotel, business hotel, and romantic hotel, not really a family with kids hotel.2) Am I looking for a hotel with a large room and bathroom?Just like NYC and a couple of other large metropolitan areas, there just aren't many hotels with large rooms/bathrooms. The Clift's bathroom is small like most hotels (W Hotel, Hotel Diva, Hiltons, Marriots) in the city.My overall impressions:ServiceBell Hops all the way up to management and front desk workers were extremely polite, friendly, and welcoming. They took our bags up to our room immediately, brought in room service promptly with a smile, and even were very friendly at the Redwood Bar getting us a table quickly without extra charges. When we checked out, our bags did not make it out to the car right away and our car was a few minutes late. The doorman was immediately on his phone and little radio twice to correct the situation promptly. I have read negative reviews about the service about six months ago on this site. These reviews are now false b/c either management was changed or they changed their style of customer service. Either way, smart move Clift, your service will keep bringing people back.RoomSmall, but so are the majority of rooms in SF. Great king sized bed with comfortable sheets/comforter. Pillows are down so if you are allergic (wife is) just call down to housekeeping and they will accomodate your needs. Bathroom is small but not completely terrible. There are also mirrors in the room which can make it a tad bit easier when getting ready to go out for the night. Only suggestion for this hotel is purchase some better quality towels. The white, holiday inn style doesn't fit.Lobby/Bars/RestaurantsThe lobby can definitely throw you off if you don't expect it. There is a huge fireplace, oversized chair (like the seat is six feet off the ground), amongst other eccentric nic-nacs. Great library/sitting area with classic board games to pass the time.Redwood Room is a great bar. It has a beautiful design, plenty of seating (if you are lucky to get some), and a huge bar. Don't pass this place up. Great mix of a crowd age wise as well. Just fun, not pretentious like some of the bars/clubs in South Beach, Vegas, LA, etc.Asia De Cuba seemed like a nice restaurant. Didn't get there for dinner or lunch, but had a good breakfast. Seemed trendy, but never heard a complaint from anyone who ate there. We got a great deal on the price (below $200), but even if it was $250/$300 a night, we would definitely come back (unless the Four Seasons or Ritz was the same price). Great time and wonderful overall experience. Thanks Clift!"
221,2030,"Apr 1 2007	Disfunctional Design	From halfway across the world we were seduced to select the Clift Hotel in San Francisco in which to spend our first night in the city,by its glamorous web site, promising a first rate designer environment and luxury. Tired after trans-Atlantic and trans-continental flights we fought our way through heavy glass doors, unaided by doormen, bellhops, or staff of any other description and entered a gloomy, cavernous interior. The trademark oversized chair, tusk-backed sofa, Perspex chairs and assorted leather furniture presented no coherent design aesthetic. Ironically, the Clift Hotel was one of the first hotels that popped up on a Google search for family friendly hotels in San Francisco.Our ten year old daughter, herself well traveled, described the hotel instantly as &quot;creepy&quot;. After checking in we were still offeredno assistance whatsoever with our luggage and had to manage our own way to our room in dark and gloomy lifts more suited to seedy night clubs than luxury hotels. As for the room, it appeared to have been decorated with bargain basement sales items in the nature of paints, carpets, curtains and wall hangings that would not otherwise have sold. Grey carpet met chintzy beige curtains, lilac, purple and white paints, beech furniture and fake and uncomfortable French period-style chairs. Copious mirrored walls were apparently meant to balance the unbalancable lot.The bathroom design was undoubtedly copied from 1970s state hospital bathroom designs. The bathroom space itself was large enough to have allowed an architect or interior designer with any talent to have come up with a comfortable and functional use of space. Instead, there is a low and small bath with no space for headrest, over embellished with large stainless steal protrusions and a poorly designed bath/shower apparatus. There should be no place for shower curtains in luxury hotels! The basin is tiny with no space for toiletries. If all this does not make for an uncomfortable bathing experience already, the fog horn style noise of what was either the plumbing or the exhaust fan was migraine inducing. The bathrobes, which are typically meant to be inviting to guests, were bound and knotted up, tight as mummies, so that one finally gave up the effort to put one on. Walls in the hotel are clearly porous and made of paper. We were woken at 3:00 AM by guests in a neighbouring room who carried on for more than an hour a normal but inane conversation, of which we could do no other but lie and listen to every single word.Staff in general were either absent or wholly disinterested in the hotels clients. We could not leave soon enough. If this hotel represents San Franciscos design aspirations, aesthetic sense and hospitality, the city should be worried. We will gladly pay for beauty, comfort, efficiency and friendly service. We found none of these qualities at the Clift Hotel."
222,2030,"Mar 9 2007 	Great service..how a 5-stars should be	We had recently a 4-nights stay in San Francisco on the way to our Honeymoon. Before arriving I called the hotel to warn that we were up for a late-check in, the girl at the phone was exquisitely kind and confirmed me that they would be waiting for us. Check-in went smooth and quick, we got a complimentary upgrade to a junior-suite. The room was nice and clean, the design great (hey, I reckon I'm design-addicted), the bed super-comfortable and they have great sheets. Great lightings and atmosphere. Enough choice for breakfast and for (midnight)snacks, (in both cases you got different menu's to choose from), everything was delivered quite timely. The only minus: the bathroom is really very small! For the rest we totally enjoyed our stay, perfect service, from the beginning to the end: professional, kind and always ready to make us feel welcome and to satisfy our requests. This is how a four stars should be! We loved the place, the atmosphere, the Redwood-Room, the fire-place and the attitude...and of course, the location! Great &amp; hip place to stay when in SFO!"
223,2030,"Mar 5 2007 	100% Great Experience	This review is for a one night stay (March 3 - 4) in room #1128.Upon arriving at the hotel (friend and I walked from Powell Street BART Station), I immediately noticed that they had finally put a sign on the exterior (metal letters, set discreetly on the front of the building by the entrance). When we started walking past the tree pots set on the outside Geary Street wall of the building, my friend said, &quot;I already think I am going to like this place&quot; due to the understated but stylish exterior vibe.Upon entering the fantastically designed lobby, we encountered no line at check-in. My friend went off to ogle the spectatcular design elements while I dealt with check-in. The woman handling that was friendly and welcoming...in fact, none of the snottiness pointed out in some other reviews was encountered by us with any of the staff during this visit. But we are smiley, friendly people so maybe that's what we got back? Who knows -- I just felt very welcome the entire visit.We then took the opportunity to enjoy a drink in the Redwood Room before the party scene started -- it's a stunning space, and the redesign of several years ago was sympathetic and successful. Going when it is quiet may not be a party highlight, but it is certainly an opportunity to enjoy the magnificence of this space -- and a good cocktail!When we got to the room, we discovered that the management had delivered a bottle of sparkling wine (Gloria Ferrer blanc de noir) and a lovely flower arrangement, with their compliments. Most kind of them!Our purpose for coming to the Clift this time was to host a 40th birthday party for a friend, including 10 guests, so we had booked a 925 square foot one-bedroom suite with living and dining area. It was spectatcular -- very large, private, quiet and beautifully designed with loads of windows and large wall mirrors to keep things bright and several pieces of custom Phillipe Starck furniture that are unique to that room. There is an 8-place oval dining table covered with a custom cut piece of orange mirror glass. Wild! But very sophisticated, too. It's &quot;freaky-chicy&quot; as one of our guests said.The room service team arranged everything perfectly -- four hot appetizers had been ordered a week before-hand, as well as red wine glasses, Champagne flutes and iced Champagne buckets (we bought our own wine at the very well-appointed wine shop two blocks away -- Moet &amp; Chandon White Star and Stags Leap Wine Cellars &quot;Artemis&quot;). By the way -- we got NO bad vibes at all about bringing our own wine and the people in room service, in the days before our arrival, were a pleasure to work with. We asked to have everything set up by 6:30pm and it was done by 6:40pm. Pretty good!The room is great for entertaining, and after two hours or so, we all left for the Vivienne Westwood party at the DeYoung Museum. Upon returning close to midnight, some of us enjoyed cocktails and appetizers in the Living Room area, which was dark and private -- the Redwood Room is a great place to party, but we were too pooped to deal with that scene.We slept soundly in the excellent bed and in the morning were shouting for joy over the strongest water pressure from a hotel shower either of us had experienced in quite some time! The bathroom has ample space for personal effects and the dressing room outside the bathroom has a table-with-mirror and huge closets for even more storage.We requested a late check-out at 2pm which was immediately approved. Then we went downstairs to enjoy our breakfast. The Asia de Cuba french toast was amazing -- it had a veritable mountain of whipped cream -- and bravo to the restaurant for also offering &quot;design it yourself&quot; egg-white omelettes for those of us fat-averse types! Breakfast was not cheap but we had a couple Mimosas, so it was our own fault! LOL And if you want cheap, there are a couple greasy spoons a block or two up Geary that serve good diner food (I think one is called the Olympic Flame and I've had good eggs-toast-and-bacon brekkies there).Check-out was a breeze and there were no &quot;hidden charges&quot; on the bill. Once again, the staff just could not have been more friendly -- even the cleaning staff one passed in the halls smiled and said &quot;Hello.&quot;I had some fears about the complexity of the expectations I had of the hotel -- the food, getting it set up, making sure it was a memorable and flavorful 40th birthday for my friend -- and I just could not be more pleased. They got EVERYTHING right.I will most certainly be returning to The Clift....in fact, I have the same room booked for July 6! Good job to everyone at the hotel and thank you for making my friend's 40th birthday truly special."
224,2030,"Feb 28 2007 	over priced - no value here	Stayed here for the weekend. We were here for a family event. We asked if we could get connecting rooms. Not possible. Everytime we came and left the hotel we were attacked by panhandlers. We ate in the resturant Sunday morning 7 adults and 2 children for breakfast was $249. Rooms were small but clean. We brought our own beer into the mini bar, so they took the bottle opener out of there so we could not open our beer.We will not return."
225,2030,Feb 18 2007 	Average in everything except the price	The hotel has a very good location 1.5 blocks from Union Square. The Service was adequate and the rooms were clean but small. Also I think the hotel is overpriced for the service they are providing.
226,2030,"Feb 17 2007 	Traveler be aware.....	Purchased a trip through Orbitz - picked this hotel because of the excellent ratings. Lovely lobby, but... be aware that this hotel does enforce its policy of surcharging at the time of check in. Although we paid for our room (which was quite small, but clean) well in advance, and imprinting a CC is standard, but we were quite dismayed on receiving a call from AMEX asking us about an unusual charge (it was in excess of $1000). Management indicated that this was standard practice. We've never experienced this before (we're in our 50's) so thought we should share this information. In our case, it was not an issue, but for a younger couple on a budget, this might create a problem."
227,2030,"Feb 14 2007	Very Good Customer Service	I recently wrote about my dissatisfaction with the Clift Hotel's New Year's Eve 2007 VIP Party. After speaking with Lauren we were informed that this event was managed by a 3rd party.In addition, Lauren gave us the contact information for Uncorked Events. They assured us that this is not their normal business practice and we are working toward a partial refund.Thanks Clift Hotel and Uncorked for protecting your brand.Very Impressive Customer Service and it leaves us feeling like their is something to be said about dealing with reputable businesses such as yours! Although I wasn't able to delete my prior posting, I want to make sure i note that your hotel understands and manages situations very well.Thanks again."
228,2030,"Feb 14 2007 	ignore the bad press	just had to post a review after reading the negative comments posted previously. i spent 2 weeks at the clift last year, travelling from australia specifically to stay at the hotel. i could not fault the 14 nights there. yes the hotel is located at the corner of the tenderloin districts start - but so what ? exit the hotel - turn right and you are 5 mins from union square ! the hotel was spotless, the staff great, the rooms fine - it was a great experience. ignore the negatives - give the place a try, and if you have amex platinum enjoy the room upgrades. and by the way - i don't work for morgans hotel group :)"
229,2030,"Feb 9 2007	Overpriced with bad service	Avoid this place at all cost. It is located in San Francisco's Tenderloin District, one of the worst crime ridden areas of the city. Don't believe the type about its fashion designed interior or its proximity to Union Square, it is not safe to walk around at night and the rooms are tiny and dirty. This place is nothing more than a glammed up residential hotel. Also, don't believe the positive reviews on this site which were undoubtedly posted by the management. You can find much nicer hotels at much more reasonable rate than this place."
230,2030,"Feb 6 2007 	Terrible Wedding Night Stay - Very Disappointed	I know I'm writing this review late, considering I stayed at this hotel in 2004, but I recently joined TripAdvisor, so I felt the need to write a review on it since I have stayed at this establishment in the past.My husband and I had just gotten married in October of 2004 and after LOTS of research, we decided to spend our wedding night at the Clift Hotel after getting married that afternoon in Sausalito. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a very SNOBBY staff who didn't seem to care that we had just gotten married and never even bothered to utter one word of congratulations. Fine. Whatever. Then they told us to leave our bags with the bellhop and he would bring it up to our room. Needless to say, we waited over 45 minutes for the bellhop to arrive and finally, after calling the front desk twice (couldn't get through the first time), he finally arrived. He gave us a very nasty look of contempt when he walked out the door without a dime in his hands, since we decided that giving a tip would actually send the message that his service was remotely adequate.When we arrived to the room, we were extremely disappointed. The feature sheet describes the rooms as &quot;Large windows with panoramic city views overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, as well as other San Francisco landmarks.&quot; Let me tell you, the only view I got was of the brick wall looking onto the neighboring apartment building through a tiny window. Another huge disappointment, especially considering this was our wedding night.Like the other reviewers said, the bathroom was TINY and had absolutely no room for toiletries. I can't believe the feature sheet had the nerve to say &quot;Bathrooms - comfortable, OVERSIZED, and luxurious&quot;!!! What the heck??? The room itself was very small, considering the large pricetag you have to pay. Again, someone needs to revise that feature sheet that says &quot;The 363 rooms at Clift are GENEROUSLY scaled and beautifully appointed.&quot; Or do they mean the rooms are generously scaled to fit a mouse?The only highlight of our stay was the bed. I had the best night of sleep I've had in a very long time. It is the only reason I would give this review 2 stars, but after all the negatives, not even the bed can make up for everything else to give it the extra star.I am a native of the Bay Area and know that there are many other establishments to stay in San Francisco where the service and amenties are far superior than the Clift Hotel.Considering my stay at the Clift was on my wedding night, I will always have a bad taste in my mouth when I consider how awful and disappointing my stay was on what was supposed to be one of the most special evenings of my life."
231,2030,"Jan 23 2007	Fine hotel great location excellent service -- and a parking tip	Spent 5 nights at the Clift over Christmas. I'd read some of the negative reviews and had started to wonder, but I knew the location and the bar and thought I'd give it a chance any way. Very glad I did.ROOMSHad the junior suite and was very pleased. Two rooms about the same size (225 sq. feet each, 450 total), living area with one large window with a great view to Nob Hill, king size bed with dresser and bench in the other. Desk, sofa and some comfy chairs, a small entertainment center in the living room. (Yes the TV's are small but I didn't go to San Francisco to get caught up on CSI.) Kind bed in the bedroom was extrememly comfortable, the pillows and sheets as well and the duvet nice enough to want to steal/buy. The colors throughout were soft pastels, and both room had lots of mirrors that help spread the light and open the space. The bathrooms were fine, perhaps on the small side but for those who don't understand why you can't find Vegas size rooms in SF hotels, take a look around. The old architecture,especially in the theater district and down town, doesn't allow for it. The charm of hotels like these is that they still have the original feel despite the modern renovations. That said, it's also worth noting the water pressure was still amazing, which often isn't the case in the larger, older structures that might still have old plumbing -- no problem here.SERVICEI often travel over the holidays and have come to accept that most hotels and restaurants are under staffed during the holiday season and often things take a little longer to get done. Not the case here. House keeping was exemplary -- every minor request cared for almost instantly and with a smile. The front desk was friendly, always helpful without a trace of the mysterious &quot;attitude&quot; some people on here seem to be complaining of. Yes, they're younger and had nicer hair cuts than me, but they were still very professional at all times. (Only one minor complaint -- the door man did in fact seem to be invisible during our stay, which was only an issue when checking in.)THE BAR/RESTAURANTThe bar may be a bit of a scene, but with good reason: it's a great place to sit and have a drink, and the bartenders pour liberally. The redwood walls and art deco bar are understandable a tourist attraction in their own right. Even Christmas eve the bar was full and the staff a little overwhelmed, but a very friendly bar manager rolled up his sleeves and did his best to help out, giving away any of his mistakes and even many of the drinks he poured correctly. (I can't count the number of drinks that never appeared on my tab during my stay there.) Yes weekend table service is pricey -- a few hundred for a bottle wine (more for hard liquor) for the luxury of a table can be a bit much. It's also standard at any bar of that style and caliber, and the answer for those who don't want to spend that much is simple: go before 10 pm, or on a week night, or just muscle up to the bar. Or bring a bunch of friends and split the bill. Either way it's worth checking out.The restaurant, Asia de Cuba, is also beautiful and connects to the bar. The staff is friendly, the portions generous and contrary to what some say not that pricey when compared to restaurants like it. We ate there once during our stay (there are so many amazing restaurants in SF you'll never eat at the same place twice), and while I don't really like Asian-Carribean fusion food, what they do they do very well. Not necessarily my taste, although an appetizer and martini is a great start to any night...The room service menu I thought was quite good. We ordered in a few times and the food arrived quickly, fresh from the kitchen, and was delicious.I could happily go on. I'll definitely return to the Clift next time I go to SF. No it's not an inexpensive hotel, but as always you get what you pay for and I was quite pleased with what I got. PARKING TIP - the 45 dollars a night they charge at the hotel is pretty much on par with other hotels in the area (it's the theater district so parking is naturally pricey). But if you're willing to go two blocks north on Geary there's a small garage on the right that charges 15/night, 20/night with in/out privaledges. It's literally a 2 minute walk to the hotel for those who want to save some money."
232,2030,"Jan 21 2007 	Business trip OK	The hotel itself was fine for one evening as I was there on business. The mattress was comfortable, and the room was clean and well put together.The concierge/front desk/ and doorman were very nice (I don't know if it's because I am a girl, or this is how it is normally).Bathroom was well stocked with the necessities and they had thick towels. Kudos on the bathroom. The lavender walls would have given me trouble on the eyes after a few days, if I was there longer.Room is a bit sparse for my personal taste, but if you love hip, modern hotels with homeless people walking in front, this is the place for you.Around the corner, there is an indian restaurant that does GREAT indian food.......(To the left, down 2 blocks and left, halfway down the street from the hotel's entrance)."
233,2030,"Jan 11 2007 	Loved It	A bit late in posting this but had to respond to other comments! We travelled around California and finished our holiday at the Clift.I and my wife found the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly at all times,the rooms were comfortable and the bed fantastic!The Lobby design and atmosphere was excellent and the place was vibrant in the evenings.I wouldn't hesitate to return in the future...In fact I plan to"
234,2030,"Jan 4 2007	Okay downstairs medicore room	Overrated and overpriced hotel. Downstairs is okay with too dimly lighted decor and elevator (are they trying to be more European style or just saving energy or from dusting?) Once you get to the hotel floor, it is totally different-- unflattering bright light with grey walls.Room is clean but somewhat small, great bed, tiny TV (not flat screen), delicious room service food. Bathroom looks like it's done by designer while the room is some copy of any other 3-star hotel room... valet parking is so ridiculous expensive (45 bucks), might as well park half a block up or down for much less!)"
235,2030,"Nov 18 2006 	Total hype with bad service	This is the worst hotel I have stayed in. I have enjoyed Schrager hotels in NYC and London, but the Clift SF completely fell short of my expectations. The lobby and interior was hip, but the staff needs training in hotel management and good manners. The staff provided nothing but bad service to the point that I cut my stay short. This hotel attracts an obnoxious 20-something crowd looking for a drama/nighmare scene. I love hip hotels, but in a city that has so many great hotels, do yourself a favor and stay someplace else."
236,2030,"Nov 17 2006 	Another awesome stay	My boyfriend and I checked into the Clift for a weekend getaway and we had a fantastic time! The staff was incredibly friendly and thoughtful (I had mentioned to the bellman that this was a romantic getaway for us and next thing I know it - a couple of hours later we find a bottle of Champagne with a very sweet card from him in our room!). We loved our room and the decor and the bed is probably one of the most comfortable I have slept in. We hung out in the bar which had a really nice vibe to it and while we did not eat in the restaurant, we could see from our vantage point in the bar that it was hopping. Overall, it was a great experience and while the decor in itself is amazing, it was the staff that truly made our stay. Highly recommend it for anyone that is looking for a fun and exciting place to stay."
237,2030,"Nov 7 2006 	Overhyped	The public rooms in the hotel are beautiful but the bedrooms and bathrooms clearly have not had the same attention. The decor appeared more the result of one of those TV makeover shows than that of the revered Phillippe Starke. The bathroom was clearly an afterthought on the design front. The room was way too small to have a bath, which should ahve been ripped out and replaced with a decent shower unit.........a true design feature would have been a small wet room with a screen dividing the shower from the basin and toilet. The front-of-house staff were all very helpful and friendly. However, the waiting staff in the bar and restaurant leave a lot top be desired and clearly were employed for looks rather than ability (as is often the case in these designer hotels).I even took the drastic step of not leaving a tip, so disgusted was I with the wait for drinks and the inability to get it right first time."
238,2030,"Oct 31 2006 	Funky but...	The decor was cool. Very hip. The bar was awesome, and the staf f was very nice but... the reasonable rate rooms are very small. We could have lived with small, but the walls were very thin. We could hear everything in the next room. I mean everything. So- we asked to be moved thinking it was just that particular room. We had the same problem and the noice was even worse. So we had no choice but to upgrade. The room was much bigger, and we didn't hear anything next door (although we're not sure there was anyone next door). If you're looking for a romantic ,quiet ,hotel-- this is not it. Hip, fun,different-- sure this is the hotel."
239,2030,"Oct 27 2006 	Loved the Clift	I stayed at the Clift for the first time this past week for a business trip. The staff was fabulous -- everyone was friendly, helpful and very polished. In recent stays at some of the travel industry giants, the professionalism of the front desk staff, doormen, bellhops, etc. was quite poor, so this was very refreshing -- to use an analogy, it's akin to the marked the difference between the people behind the fast food counter at the airport and the people behind the desk in the Admiral's Club. The bar and restaurant are very nice, and they close the bar to external visitors on Wed nights, making it exclusive for hotel guests and their guests. This was nice, seeing as the prior three nights the bar had been packed -- while the &quot;scene&quot; was great those nights, it was nice to have it a bit more mellow too. The housekeeping was excellent -- my room was impeccable each time I returned. The doormen were great too -- as I was leaving the hotel, I realized I couldn't find my cellphone. Before I could even ask, one of them asked me what my phone number was so that they could help me find it. After I got home, I realized I'd forgotten to grab the copy of two fed ex airbills that I'd left with the concierge -- I called and he immediately offered to hunt down the info. He called back two minutes later with the tracking numbers and other info I needed. It was a refreshing change from the 20 min I usually spend on hold with customer service. It's the little courtesies like this that differentiate the great from the mediocre in my mind.. It's by far the most enjoyable business travel experience I've had this year. You can tell that this team takes a lot of pride in their work and really enjoys what they do for a living. I'd definitely stay there again the next time I'm in SF."
240,2030,"Oct 23 2006 	Excited about the Clift	Our stay at this posh boutique hotel was wonderful. We were greeted by a very pleasant front desk clerk who was able to check us into the hotel at 10am. The lobby, with its expansive fireplace, was very warm and inviting. The hotel which is a stones throw away from Union Square, is conveniently located near shops, restaurants and pubs. However, the Redwood Room Lounge had a delightful ambiance as did their fine dining restaurant, Cuba dAsia. If only the Clift had their own boutiques, there would be no reason to venture beyond their front doors. To sum it up, I found the Clift hotel to be a treasure trove of hospitality."
241,2030,"Oct 22 2006	Overrated	The staff was fantastic, and the room was very modern and bright. However, it was over $51 per day for parking($45 plus tax), and I felt that I was getting gauged. I received a fax, and I was charged a dollar per page for INCOMING faxes. It was only a few pages, but I just felt that they were figuring out ways to suck as much money out of me as possible. Also, the water pressure in the shower was great. The only problem was that there was a flimsy shower curtain that just blew around during my shower - wrapping around my leg and also permitting about a gallon of water to be on the bathroom floor. There is also no ventilation system in the bathroom, so everything in the bathroom becomes damp. I doubt that I would stay there again."
242,2030,"Oct 22 2006 	Good on an expense account--otherwise not worth it	I stayed at the Clift for 1 night this past April. It is similar to other hotels owned by this hotel group, with basic but tasteful furnishings, and an overall calm, zen feeling in the rooms. Even though the bathrrom was minimal (including a shower that was way too basic for the price of the room), I found the bed very comfortable and the night very relaxing. As it was a weekend night, the lobby was overrun a by loud, drunk, 20something crowd, most of whom were not hotel guests, and made getting in/out of the hotel a nightmare. In summary, the hotel is great if you want to party and are not paying for your own room, otherwise it is overpriced."
243,2030,"Oct 19 2006 	Clift in SF - the best!	If your travels take you to San Francisco you must stay at CLIFT! This hotel is so exclusive they don't even put the name on the outside. It's the 'who's who' and THE place to be seen in SF. We were treated like royalty from the first night. We did not have reservations in the famous Asia de Cuba restaurant (and heard you must make them weeks in advance), but they discreetly VIP'd us in anyway. The appetizers melt in your mouth and the dinner was to die for. Inside the Redwood Room (bar area), everybody is gorgeous - I swear the hotel must pay professional models to drink there. A sight to behold. The women are beautiful and the men, (ALL men older and younger) are handsome, flirtatious and classy. I enjoyed watching the pictures on the wall. The eyes move and a silent soap opera is going on-if you have time to watch. The rooms inside the hotel are very, very modern and the bed made me feel like I was on a cloud. The staff is very down to earth, very professional, and treated me like a VIP the entire time. CLIFT is so SF (is on the same street as the theatres and 1 blk from Union Square) you will miss out if you miss this gem in the city by the bay."
244,2030,"Oct 16 2006 	Nice boutique hotel	I liked this hotel and was happy there travelling with my family. We had two rooms and were moved and upgraded so we could have adjoining rooms at no extra charge, which was great. It is on the snobbier, hipper side of things, which was a bit much, but the bar scene was fun and it was nice not having to leave to go to a SF hotspot. I guess this hotel isn't for anyone, but we had a nice enough time. Extra note. Ditch the high priced room service and hit up the Starbucks across the street!Also, parking is WAY overpriced. There is another parking structure a few blocks away if you are horrified about spending $45!!! for valet a night!!!! That price makes the room rate less appealing!!!! The parking structure is still crazy (I guess Union Square parking is a nightmare) but it will still save you a bit..."
245,2030,"Oct 15 2006 	Choose Another Hotel in San Francisco	My wife and I stayed at this hotel in Mid-October 2006 on a trip with another couple. The rooms are painfully small and poorly organized. The bathrooms are so small there is no room to put your toiletries as you get ready. The $10 per day internet is fine, but there is no place readily available on or near the little desk (wedged in next to the bed) to plug in your computer.Worse even is the hotel staff. From the people at check-in who seemingly don't care, to the &quot;door man&quot; who is more interested in collecting his &quot;tips&quot; from the towncar drivers and taxi cab drivers then to even hold the door as you enter with luggage. My luggage arrived late from the airport and it was huge effort (imposition) for the staff to coordinate between the front desk and bell desk to get it. Frankly they should have delivered it directly to my room - as I tried to ask at the front desk - but again, they just don't care about you.My read is the hotel and it's staff is too interested in being &quot;hip&quot; than providing any service. I love hip hotels - try the Hotel Solara in San Diego or the Hotel Andra in Seattle for instance. But this hotel fails in every way. When you call from your room to the front desk, or to the concierge the line is BUSY. Why, I don't know - I eventually just called the hotel from an outside line to reach someone.Lastly, we checked out early - it was really that bad - and the hotel charged us a $50.00 cancellation fee. I think that shows you how you will be treated by this hotel. I won't stay there again and as one that puts a lot of credence in the TripAdvisor, I caution anyone else that might consider it. There are many great hotels in this city - I tried this one based in part on the positive TripAdvisor reviews. My mistake, don't make the same one! Anaheim, CA"
246,2030,"Oct 13 2006 	If you like over priced rooms and snobby people the CLift is your hotel	I had the honor of being in San Francisco and after sifting through innumerable hotel reviews decided to go for &quot;cool contemporary&quot;. I should have known better. I have stayed @ Schrager hotels in London, Miami and New York.I had forgotten exactly how clichd, tired, UN-service oriented and rude these hotels are. When we checked in we asked if we could get a room for our daughter who was driving in from Stanford. Even though the internet show plenty of rooms available that afternoon we were rudely informed there were no rooms. Not a chance. The front desk staff was uniformly obnoxiously. I constantly had the feeling I was interrupting a private conversation. Do they take a class on how to be that bored with the guests?The room was supposed to be a &quot;King Suite It was just an oversized room for an oversized price.The entire atmosphere was so bad, even though we had reservations for 4 days; we packed up in the morning and moved to the Omni for the remainder of the trip where we were actually greeted with smiles and good mornings!!!! EVERY time we entered the lobby!!! What a refreshing idea. By the 2nd day the staff greeted us by name as well. The crowning insult? When we checked out of the Clift the person behind the desk was so disinterested she couldn't be bothered to even ask why were leaving so soon when we had 3 more days on our reservation.There are so many great hotel choices in San Francisco don't waste your time or money at this hotel that is so 20th century."
247,2030,"Oct 9 2006 	A Sassy Luxe Indulgence	Got a great deal on Priceline ($175/night). Great room (although looking onto alley with machinery), helpful staff, and trendy decor. Very luxe and decadent, and romantic. No complaints!"
248,2030,"Oct 9 2006	All mouth no trousers	Just back from a week at the Clift. It's nice and central and the rooms are OK but it's way to big and generic to be the boutique experience it thinks it is.First impressions in the uber trendy reception are encouraging, but the styling stops as soon as you get in the lift. Rooms are boring and basic and the overall feeling is more holiday inn than cool.The bar, whilst achingly cool, is way too busy with local drinkers (most very drunk) to be much use or fun for guests. Indeed some members of out party were uprooted from their table for a non resident couple who had booked, this simply doesn't seem right.There needs to be a separate bar for residents - this works at the Sanderson.Whilst the rooms are average value, the hotel clearly aims to pump up income through hugely expensive extras. Breakfast is a rip off, room service and mini bar way too much to make sense (over walking across the road to the supermarket!). Even a movie costs $15!!Staff are aloof, but not rude.I am sure there are better, smaller, more intimate options in a city as great as SF."
249,2030,"Oct 9 2006 	Fun but ok	The hotel was conveniently located and was very swanky. The rooms and hallways were a little worn out looking. The carpets were stained and the paint looked a little dingy. We had a double double room which was very large. I heard that the king bed rooms are tiny though. The lobby is very nice and it is definitely a scene in the evening. The house cleaning staff was excellent. They were very nice and prompt with our requests. The front desk people were seemingly nice, but with an air of pretentiousness that made me want to roll my eyes.not a warm hotel (except the house cleaning staff), i probably would rather stay somewhere else next time im in SF."
250,2030,"Oct 4 2006 	Chic 	Stayed here for business, the rooms are adequate. It is definitely trying hard to be chic &amp; modern. The bar, restaurant, gym, and business center are all excellent-- as is the room service. However, the rooms are a bit small and not as immaculate as I would have liked. However, I would definitely recommend this hotel-- very fun!"
251,2030,"Sep 26 2006 	Very impressed with the Clift	We spent the last two nights of our month long USA honeymoon in the Clift, and were delighted with our decision to stay there. From arrival, we found all of the staff extremely friendly and helpful, from the door staff, to the receptionists to the bar staff. They were extremely welcoming, which isn't always the case in top end hotels, and were keen to share their enthusiasm about San Francisco.Our room was funky, and as with everyone else we thought that the bar was great.The concierge was extremely helpful, getting us a reservation at Michael Mina at short notice, and even letting them know that it was our honeymoon so that we got special treatment.Overall, it's the only hotel I'd stay in next time I vist SF&gt;"
252,2030,"Sep 17 2006 	Clift: Great Bar and Ground Floor But Improve Service Focus!	This is a funky Boutique Hotel aimed at a younger (or young at heart) audience which appreciates the contemporary vibe. I am a frequent traveller and have stayed in St. Martin's Lane, the sister hotel in London.I was really excited about my stay at the Clift, and got a deal via travelzoo, booking on the hotel website for $244/night. Regular rooms were as low as $175 including breakfast.GOOD POINTSGreat location two minutes walk from Union Square, and very helpful Concierge. Lovely reception area decor. Superb Redwoom Room bar. In my room sheets were superb quality, air conditioning worked brillianty and housekeeping was efficient (if noisy in the morning). Spacious deluxe room (333) had two beds and plenty of bathroom space, albeit a 1970s low-style flat backed tub.LESS GOOD POINTSFIRST Check in experience was poor; new trainee was trying very hard and was professional, but should have had closer more dedicated supervision from his manager, and she was not able to dedicate enough time to supporting him, this meant he was made to look incompetent, which must have been unsettling to him and not ideal for me the customer either (it took nearly ten minutes to check me in on a simple reservation).He told us our room category was overbooked, and we were being upgraded to a larger room on a high floor. Yippee we thought. Then I noticed we were being checked into a standard room; when I brought this to his attention we were found the paid for Deluxe Room, but on the very low third floor.SECOND, the mattress support slats under the bed in my room had fallen out meaning the mattress was unsupported and uneven; I understand these things happen and when I raised it with the front desk when I realised the next morning after a poor night's sleep it was dealt with BUT the response was simply &quot;we'll deal with it&quot; rather than demonstrating concern that I may have had an uncomfortable night's sleep. I must stress I was NOT looking for any compensation here. But more of an apology/concern should have been demonstrated by the front desk person at a five star hotel. Maybe this is a cultural thing, but &quot;sorry&quot; goes a long way.This was a minor insignificant issue for me, but other may not have had the energy to check what the problem with the bed was (the mattress was heavy to lift up!) and a verbal apology should accompany any complaint.THIRD Housekeeping started asking if rooms were free at 0830am by knocking and announcing &quot;housekeeping&quot; loudly - surely a more efficient system could be established to avoid waking your many international guests who are on a different tmie zone, and a clearer encouragement to guests to use the Privacy Please door guards to avoid this unwanted noise?FOURTH noise from the street. This is an urban location, and frankly those who complain need to get over it. By the time the traffic gets going you should be out there enjoying the sights!FINALLY, my rate booked on the Morgans site included breakfast but this was not noted in my reservation and I only received this paid for benefit by having the foresight to print out the reservation at the time of booking and was made to present this to the frontdesk. Your reservation system needs to ensure all special offer benefits are noted in detail in the reservation. Same thing happened when I stayed in St Martins Lane so this is a systemic problem.I stay about 50 hotel nights a year for business and pleasure, and had a superb stay at St Martin's Lane earlier in the year, but my experience at the Clift was mixed, which was a disappointment, and most of these problems noted above are &quot;soft&quot; people skill or process change issues which should easily be fixed with management attention.I tried submitting this via the email link I was sent after my stay, but once I had filled out all the data, the site crashed when I submitted it - a great idea but again you need to follow up on the detail.I expect high standards from such a five star hotel, and my review is therefore somewhat picky, but I hope fair given the prices some people pay for rooms here.VERDICT: What would have been an awesome stay was made less so by poor management of trainees, a lack of empathy from the front desk, noisy housekeeping and problems with ensuring guest entitlements are captured when making the reservation online."
253,2030,"Sep 2 2006 	Needs to focus on the basics	My wife and I got this hotel through a Priceline four star hotel &quot;name your own price deal&quot; although it still worked out as one of the most expensive of the nine places we stayed on in our visit to the States. I personally found the door and desk staff to be polite and helpful. The hotel and our room was clean and comfortable, with a nice bed. They gym was generally very well maintained and well equipped, although a cross-training machine would be a good addition. The location was convenient for the Union Square area.We found the decor a bit off-the-wall, and even quite funny, in some places (the bizarre collection of chairs in reception; the neon lighting in the lifts; the obsession with mirrors and curtains in the room). But this is ultimately a matter of personal taste, and its good to see a hotel trying to do something a bit different in this regard. However, this minimalist &quot;style&quot; comes at the cost of functionality. Our bathroom (see photo) was tiny. The room itself was by far the smallest of the nine hotels we stayed in, and storage space was one small closet (see photo). I'm over 6 feet tall but I still had to stand on a chair to use the room safe. Despite the lack of other storage options, the bedside table was just a big transparent block (see photo). The radio alarm clock was so complicated that we couldn't use it. We eventually gave up and I set the alarm on my phone instead. The TV was small, but big enough for such a small room.I cant understand why the Clift doesnt put a proper sign up. Aside from the inconvenience to customers who have pre-booked, they must miss out on passing trade. There is a sign, but it took me two days to spot it.We didn't use room service, but we noticed that it would have been subject to no less than three separate charges (something like a service charge, a delivery charge and a gratuity). Im pleased to see the hotel management are monitoring this site. If the coolness and pretentiousness was toned down a bit, and the focus was moved towards improving the guest experience, this could be a reasonable hotel, although the room size issue remains a problem. That said, I'm not really bothered about whether a hotel maintains its &quot;avant garde vibe&quot;, so I'm probably not the real target audience. My wife described the Clift as &quot;trying to be pretentious&quot; which just about summed it up for me."
254,2030,"Aug 29 2006	Good Hotel	This is a very good hotel. The location is excellent, though valet parking ($48) is far too expensive. The rooms are very nice, but the room our kids stayed in was much nicer than ours! The foyer of the hotel is interesting but too dark, chilly and windy, even in August. However, the bar and restaurant are highlights. Breakfast is terrific, open til 11.30 and far better than in other hotels in this chain. I had no complaints to make about snooty staff."
255,2030,"Aug 8 2006	Fantastic hotel	We stayed here for the last few days of our honeymoon and really enjoyed it! Had a studio suite and it was a great size, the bathroom was massive so I think it may be pot luck what size the bathrooms are in the room. It's a really cool hotel, and we found everyone really helpful, receptionists, doormen, etc, and had no issues. It was definitely the coolest hotel we've stayed in, the burgers from room service are great! And a great location. We really enjoyed it here :)"
256,2030,"Aug 7 2006	Most disappointing SF hotel stay ever	NEVER in my life have I been so disappointed as with the Clift Hotel this weekend. I live in CA and travel to San Francisco frequently--at least 6 to 8 weekends a year. I have stayed in many of the three and four star hotels in the Union Square area. To say that the staff was inattentive was an understatement. The doorman often ignored persons trying to enter the hotel. The front desk clerk completely ignored a reservation that GUARANTEED a king size sleigh bed. The staff ignored the &quot;privacy please&quot; sign on the door. Clearly dressed for a special occasion, we were seated at a table in the restaurant that was half in the restaurant, half in the bar -- the music was so loud we could hardly hear ourselves think, much less talk.The room was modern -- CHEAP modern that tries to pass itself off as being cool but fails miserably. The lighting in the bathroom was so flourescent and the tile choice so awful (sickly white 12&quot; tiles) that both of us remarked that we felt that if we stayed in the shower too long, we would require institutionalization, as the awfulness of it would make us crazy. Not only that, but the floor wasn't particularly clean and the tub caulking clearly needed redoing. It was terrible.If you are looking for a hotel with an ok web site but horrible service, disappointing rooms and inattentive staff, stay at the CLIFT. Otherwise, keep looking. There are SO many options in the Union Square area, there's no reason to settle for such disappointment, especially for this price."
257,2030,Jul 27 2006	shame the hotel wasnt as good as the restaurant!	we arrived at the clift late afternoon to find we had to struggle in with our own luggage (3 bags!) the reception staff were very unhelpful and uninterested. we eventually managed to get everything sorted and were shown up to our room on the 9th floor. the room was a 'junior suite' and they tried to make out we had a separate living room by putting a curtain inbetween the bedroom and the living room!! the bathroom was tiny and dirty. i stayed here with my mum and unfortunatley on the first night she didnt feel well and had been suffering from a bad foot. she decided to phone down to reception to ask if there was a doctor that would come to the hotel only to be told ther wasnt one local however the receptionist 'put her through' to the closest one and she was told to phone someone else. we eventually decided to go to the hospital just to be safe. when we came back from the hospital that evening the doormen were talking to some girls outside and we had to let ourselves in! The following night we ate in the hotel restaurant aisa de cuba which was fantastic! i think the hotel only show intrest in the restaurant and bar. at the end of the day we were only sleeping there so we ignored it but i wouldnt stay there again.
258,2030,"Jul 20 2006 	a great place close to action unique for the right price	The Clift is a treasure of San Francisco's past. We had a great price for only $175 and it was worth it at that price. The rooms are small, especially the bathrooms. The room was spotlessclean and the linens so refreshing compared to other hotels.White linens. We stayed on the inside part of the hotel so there was no noise. The lobby/bar area is happening at night and seems to be a under 40 group. Our rate of 175 included breakfast which was so fresh and the atmosphere was wonderful. No ice machines, you must ask it by room service.Check their website and maybe you can get a great deal.I would not pay $300 for the experience. Have fun and enjoy SF."
259,2030,"Jul 5 2006	Stay somewhere else...	The bar and lobby were great and so were the staff, however the rooms were small, walls extremely thin and it's not what you'd expect for an upscale hotel. I've stayed at Morgans properties before and The Clift doesn't compare to The Shore Club or any others. Next time I visit I'll definitely stay somewhere else!"
260,2030,"Jul 4 2006	Service needs improvement	We recently stayed at the Clift Hotel for 6 nights. Everything was quite plesant with the exception of a couple of receptionists (We had problems with them from check in till check out) and the door man on Saturday evening. Seems like the female staff were much more professional and helpful compared to the male staff.Everything seems like such an effort with a few (male) receptionists. When we requested for a queen size bed, he made us fell like he was doing us a huge favor. Even if he really did, perhaps it is not necessary to make it known to the customers. The receptionist (male again) was also very unhelpful with my requests for transfer to the airport upon checking out. I ended up making my own arrangements. From my experience, a hotel of this calibre should have more professional and helpful staff to assist customers. Returning to the hotel around midnight on Saturday was rather unplesant too. The doorman was impolite; behaving more like a typical door -----; which is what I do not appreciate from a hotel.Overall, the hard ware is great but the soft ware needs much fine tuning!"
261,2030,"Jun 17 2006 	Fun funky and a great location!	I loved the funky and up market style of the hotel. The location is great too! The ooms are cleverly done, so that they are small small but still do not feel stifling!A good hotel"
262,2030,"May 20 2006 	Very nice	Stayed here for three nights in March. The guys at the door were really nice and helpful about getting cabs, into clubs, advice etc. The clerks were quite nice too.The single room is small as the massive bed takes away most of the space. The bathroom is super small considering the status of the hotel and room rates. The room itself is mostly white and comfy, but it sure is small. Theres not a lot of luggage space if it'd be two people in there. I worked an entire day on my laptop in the room and it felt comfy, so no complaints really.The food at the restaurant was allright, but hella pricey, but bar is nice. We went there friday night and as usual to get a table, you gotta buy a 300 dollar plus bottle. We just went in and sat at one of the free tables and no one came to bother us. The bar gets very full and it's not exactly a party vibe, but its a good chillout spot.The hotel's not in a particulary rough area at all, its the usual SF street scene. The location is superb, almost everything is a walking distance and the hotel is just a block or two away from the hustle and bustle, so it's not so busy there. Lots of good cafeteria's and restaurants around the premise."
263,2030,"May 18 2006	We really liked it	Firts let me start by saying I'm extremely fussy when it comes to hotels and service and for the most part I certanily wasn't disappointed.From previous reviews, which had commented on the bad service etc I was slightly dubious checking in. However, I have to say they were one of the most pleaseant and helpful hotel I think I've been to. We started a 3 week holiday in San Fran, and stayed 2 nights in the Clift but at separate times, staying elsewhere in between.The staff remebered us from when we had first checked in and asked us about our trip etc, which I thought quite a nice touch as it made you feel slightly special they'd bothered.The reception and common areas are very &quot;sultry&quot; and we did have bets what colour lift would trun up!The rooms are what I would consider value for money 130 ish per night. I didn't notice any noise from either side but that may have been because the hotel wasn't full.My only slights on this hotel would, yes the bathroom is very small, however, it was much larger in our second room, we were upgraded. And I know the Red Room is fabulous, but is a tad expensive and I wasn't particularly impressed with the menu for Asia de Cuba either. Lastly it is in a bit of a rough area, but then again I thought San Fran rough on the whole and didn't feel safe there.Overall we really enjoyed it and the staff comtributed to that as nothing was too much trouble.Would I recommend it, yes, but having seen the location I think I would probably go for the St Gregory."
264,2030,"May 13 2006	Don't bother staying here - overrated overpriced 	Stayed at The Clift for 3nights in May06 and 3nights was long enough!When we arrived at our room we were v. disappointed. It was v minimalist to the extreme (2 tiny drawers for clothes), furniture looked cheap (sort of stuff get in ikea), room was v small and bathroom was ridiculously small.In addition, the room was incredibly noisy - road traffic noise &amp; walls paper thin - could hear every word of conversation from people next door. Although bed was comfy, don't expect to have a good night's sleep here unless you're a very heavy sleeper! Overall, overrated and overpriced and we would definitely not stay at The Clift again."
265,2030,"May 12 2006	A little bit of luxury	Excellent location right on Geary within 5 mins walk from Union Square and surrounded by plenty of good breakfast places, we loved The Clift. What topped our first few nights in California was the Philippe Starck stamp on the place - the oversized chair in reception, the enormous fireplace, the dark wood panelled corridors and different coloured lifts. The bar is something to be seen although don't expect to get a seat anywhere if your turn up for after dinner drinks, nearly all the tables are reserved. We would have to agree with the Lonely Planet review on the thin walls front - we could hear next doors TV loud and clear - a real shame they skimped on that crucial part of the design. The bed was fabulous, the linen silky to the touch. The items in the mini bar had been so well thought about (spare floppy disc, candles etc) it was such a shame they were so overpriced I can't imagine they sell much.All in all we were glad we have chosen The Clift for the first few nights of our honeymoon in California."
266,2030,"May 9 2006	Euro Chic in the US	I recently stayed here on a visit to San Francisco and must say that it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.The room was huge and clean, with great views of the city. The service was friendly and informal without ever slipping from a very high standard. The design and ambience of the hotel is superb also, with the slick Redwood Room Bar and the Asia de Cuba Restaurant stunning. The hotel is nice and quiet, but the bar is buzzing in the evenings and is one of THE places to go drinkning in the city. Very handy if you're sleeping upstairs. Overall I cannot fault the hotel at all and would definitely recommend staying there to anybody."
267,2030,"Apr 24 2006	Great location very modern	The appeal of modern amenities, an Asia de Cuba, the famous Redwood Room bar was my reason for choosing this hotel. If you like hip and modern, this is the hotel for you. It wouldn't hurt for them to offer a little more value for your money, though."
268,2030,"Apr 22 2006 	Completely Overrated	I thought this hotel was completely overrated and uncomfortable at best. I've visited SF many times and I usually stay at Hotel Monaco, right across the street from the Clift. Unfortunately for me this time around they did not have an availability so I decided to give the Clift a try. I only stayed a couple of nights but I couldn't wait to get out of there. The room is so sparce and minimalist in design that it was uncomfortable. I couldn't figure out how to operate the lights, the walls seem paper thin because I could here any movement or talk happening in the hallway and an ear-piercing alarm went off in the middle of the night and wasn't turned off for 30 minutes at least. But let's get back to the furnishing; I truly was not impressed. It didn't even look good. Plastic cubes that looked like they came right out of Ikea served as nightstands. While I appreciated the spacious bathroom, the rack to hold items was a mile away from the sink, and with only 1 floor mat on a very large marble floor, I literally had to slide the mat everytime I stepped so I didn't have to step on the icy cold tile. The the hotel upholds it's swanky reputation with the lounge but I was so turned off and uncomfortable there that I tried to spend every moment posbbile away from it. Everytime I stepped outside I looked at the Hotel Monaco longingly. My recommendation: stay at the Hotel Monaco for a truly comfortable and relaxing time and perhaps visit the Clift for a night at the lounge for drinks."
269,2030,"Apr 6 2006	Not what I was hoping.......	I stayed at the Clift for five nights. This has been my fifth Ian Schrager hotel and I have to say my least favorite. Yet, all in all, it was still pretty good. The service at the desk was very attentive and not at all snobby. I had a corner room which was considerably quieter than I understand the other rooms to be. There were cigarette burns on the carpet and a big very noticeable burn on the bedside table. I don't understand why they didn't at least replace the table. The cleaning women clearly worked very hard but I spilled conditioner on the bathroom floor the first night and the remnant stain was never wiped up. It became a spectator sport each afternoon to see if the floor would actually ever get wiped clean. It never did. The one thing that I found inconsistent with other Ian Schrager hotels was the doormen. In five days of coming and going, the door was only held open for us twice. They seemed completely inept at working the door of a city hotel. The subleties of coolness and attention to detail are lost on them. I fear that this chain has just stopped trying. The rooms aren't as 'shiny and new' and the staff don't seem as compelled to excell. I hope I am wrong."
270,2030,"Mar 20 2006 	Nice Place to Visit But...	Probably one of the most overrated hotels I've ever stayed in -- the Clift makes a great &quot;E!&quot; Network backdrop but is overpriced, impractical, and thinks it's way cooler than it is.I've never felt insulted and ignored in a restaurant while ordering a $40 breakfast before, but there's a first time for everything, and the Clift's Asia de Cuba definitely delivered on the &quot;you're not cool enough to be here&quot; theme. The guest room looks like something out of architectural digest -- great in pictures, but not so great for real human beings. If your idea of fun is trying to figure out how to work the lights in your room, or guess where the hair dryer is, the Clift is for you -- design definitely trumps usability in this hotel.This isn't to say The Clift doesn't have anything going for it; the bar is swanky and entertaining, and I've eaten at the Asia de Cuba at the Mondrian in LA, and the food there was good. But the Clift is one of those hotels that makes a better side trip than a principal destination. My advice: stay at the Hotel Monaco next door, and journey over to the Clift one night for drinks. The Monaco offers complimentary wine and cheese, massages, ethernet, and workout room, and its restaurant is a lot more down to earth. The Clift offers complimentary attitude, and charges you a premium for the privilege."
271,2030,Mar 6 2006 	Moved my group of 5 to the Clift from the W Hotel.	I called the Clift and spoke to a manager about relocating my small group to the Clift. She was fun to talk to and she did an excellent job of selling me on why I should stay there. I moved the group and my guest were pleased. They assited me in getting the group into the bar on a busy night and the bar management was all over the group as if we were VIP's. The W does a good job but the Clift went above and beyond for me. I'll stay there again.
272,2030,"Mar 3 2006	Our favorite for a night on the town	We try to go in to &quot;the City&quot; from our home in the 'burbs on a regular basis for a bit of culture and good food. We splurge and spend the night at the Clift afterwards (which also allows us to have wine with dinner). We've stayed here with our teenagers on several occasions, and we all agree that it is a fabulous, fun place. The beds are wonderfully comfortable, the price is reasonable, and the location is excellent for SF theaters, jazz clubs and shopping. We all love the decor and the kids relish the opportunity to get into the Redwood Room, skipping the line at the door as a hotel guest. We've had nothing but great service here (including an offer to track down tickets to a sold out show). I can't wait for our next visit!"
273,2030,"Mar 3 2006 	Cliff Internet	The internet connection at the CLIFT is FANTASTIC! Normally, when I logon to my network at my office in Boston, it takes about  minute or so for the authentication. On the network at CLIFT, I enter my password, press enter, and BAM !! I am on instantly."
274,2030,Feb 28 2006	Amazing Experience	I absolutely loved the Clift. I spent my 2nd wedding anniversary there and the experience was just delightful. I had mentioned when I booked my reservation that it was a special occasion and all I can say is WOW! The hotel is just magic. I had never been to the Clift but after reading what a few people had posted onthe site I thought I would give it a chance.....I would recommend. My next visit I will defintely stay at the Clift.
275,2030,"Feb 24 2006	home away from home	I stay in San Francisco about four times a year for a week or more each time and the staff at The Clift has made me feel welcome time and time again! I originally picked this hotel based on the Ian Schreager reputation, but have since discarded that for just the sheer fact that this hotel has the best beds and bedding i've ever slept on! Also-the rooms have beautiful daylight and in the evening, the low-lite rooms are very soothing and calming. The hotel staff has always taken care of me and any associates i've traveled with. They's been very curtious, helpful and very promt! The only thing missing is the great Nakamichi stereos that used to be in the rooms. Bring those back and I may move in permanatly!"
276,2030,"Feb 23 2006	LOVE this place ! so much !	I cannot overstate how great this hotel is. Ignore all those bad reviews - I think those people either had a bad day or were a little rude themselves. If you go in here, smile and have fun with the staff, it will be youru best hotel experience ever !!! (Some of those other reviews are old, too, and I can say from personal experience that new managers have made this place SHINE !! It just keeps getting better ...) The rooms are so beautiful, with the most sumptuous king sized beds and fabulous sheets. Something like a million thread count ! You will get into that huge comfy bed and not want to get back out. So order room service - the food is awesome (a little pricey, like ALL room service, but so worth it ! Live it up a little !) and stay IN ! The last time I was here with my girlfriend, it rained all day and we didn't even care. We went to a great little Thai place right across the street and ate in and watched movies and just enjoyed the wonderful room !!!Super clean, a great location, beautiful lobby and restaurant - this one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at, and the only one I even think about in SF."
277,2030,"Feb 23 2006	Modern Design heaven !!!	My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel because I am a fan of modern furniture designer Phillipe Starck. We came to see the rooms and the interiors, and we keep coming back for the outstanding service, fantastic rooms and amazing cuisine at the restaurant ! If you stay here (and you should) you definitely should try Asia de Cuba - I had the best meal of my life there on New Year's Eve !! The location is also excellent - right near the theaters and Union Square. But best of all, they really take care of us and make sure we have a great stay every time."
278,2030,"Feb 17 2006	Escape to an exciting hotel!	My partner and I stayed at the CLIFT this past weekend and would definitely recommend the CLIFT to anyone looking to escape their normal life and enter an exciting hotel with buzzing public spaces. The bar atmostspire kept us drinking until 1:30am and we only drink wine at dinner when staying at the Four Season or Ritz-Carlton. They just don't have the bar scene that the CLIFT does. We enjoyed the rooms and found the housekeeping staff to be extremely friendly. They say hello to everyone that walks by. The staff at the hotel appeared to be having a lot of fun with each other which enhanced our moods from the minute we walked into the hotel. BOTTOM LINE: GREAT HOTEL, ENJOY THE BAR AND ESCAPE FROM LIFE!"
279,2030,"Feb 9 2006 	Repeat guest and loving it!	We visit this hotel almost every month because we are addicted to the San Francisco atmosphere. We have tried out other high-end hotels such as the Fairmont and the Westin, but nothing compares to the ambiance, service, cool-factor and experience that the Clift offers, you really feel what it's like to be &quot;in the city&quot;.The staff (from what we have noticed) is a revolving crew, in the 2 years we have been going, we have developed a first name relationship with half of the staff because the same young me and women are always there, and when we arrive to check in, they will upgrade our rooms just because we are so loyal at no extra charge! When i arrived with my arms full of roses without a vase, the valet called and had a vase waiting for me at my room by the time we put our bags down! And lastly, THE DECOR! wow, if you want to be impressed, the hip-underground music that is thumped in their famous RedWood Room bar and lounge is enough to get your blood pulsing! The furniture is an eclectic collection of one of a kind artist originals and luxury. All of your senses are delighted, the contrast of a stark white bathroom in the middle of an almost pitch black hallway, red purple and green illuminated elevators, incense gently floating along the corridors of the many elaborately decorated avenues in the hotel. The Bedrooms have every amenity needed to make you feel like you are a visiting rock star for a weekend...and if you stay there, i guarantee you will want to party like one!"
280,2030,"Jan 30 2006	Nice but not worth the money	Chose the hotel because of the central location, and wanted a nice place to base ourselves for a tour of SF. Were a few homeless around giving hassle, but just ignore them and they went (eventually), so not too much trouble. The room itself was nice, but very small, have stayed at a Schrager hotel (Sanderson) in London, and it was much much nicer. Also ate in the restaurant which was also overpriced and food seemed to be much worse than the Asia de Cuba in NY. Bar was cool though. It was a stop off on a road trip through USA, and was generally worse than hotels less than half the price.Very difficult to find from the street (never saw the hotel name anywhere on the exterior), so make sure you get a good map if you're driving there!"
281,2030,"Jan 23 2006	Nice hotel annoying part of town	My g/f and I stayed here a couple weeks ago...the hotel itself was cool, nice staff, etc. (granted, parking was $60 for one night) But, what most reviews do not tell you (and what I wish I would have known prior to my trip) is that the neighborhood is flourished with very annoying homeless people. I live in Manhattan...where there is a fair share of them....but, I was surprised at, not only the number of homeless, but the fact that EVERY one of them would get in your face begging for something. This really put a damper on our SF experience. I would recommend staying somewhere else, unless you enjoy being surrounded by large crowds of tourists, complimented by a homeless man screaming in your ear."
282,2030,"Jan 18 2006	A hotel that is not worth the money	Stayed at the clift for one night as part of my honeymoon trip . The hotels lobby its ok Philip Stark style ....contemporary,modern etc. I stayed in one of their most expensive rooms , a Loft Suite (350 per night plus taxes )and was totally dissapointed by the bathroom facilities. A cheap courtain , a small tube are not worth the money paid. Besides this , the TV in the room is ultrasmall ridiculously small relative to the size of the room. The front desk offered a complimentary bottle of champagne that never arrived (i dont drink alcohol so that was not a problem). Bottom Line : Not worth the money they charge you there are 50 better places to stay in Sfco. (I am writing this comment regreting not having considered the negative comments i read on Trip advisor about this hotel when i made the reservation ...all were true)"
283,2030,"Dec 21 2005	Unusual more of a club than a hotel	I have never been staying at a hotel where i had to show my room key to get in on the weekened becaseu it was so full of people wanting ot go to the bar until we stayed here.Also thought it was stuck up there was no signage. We drove around for 15 mins looking for it. I finally went in becuase it looked like an upscale bar. Wait there is a sign - that you can only see the the roof of antoher building! The carpet in the halls was water stained. When we walked inot our room we were like uh....we are changing hotels. The orange plastic table was a bit...surprising. The sink was very...phallic. The bathroom was ok but not great by any means. The sitting area could be completely curtained off like a genie in a bottle. We had no view. After the first day, we parked in a garage not even 1/2 block away - they rip you off for parking. But we grew to like our little strange hotel room. It was quite the different experience.BUT the staff was amazing. Very good concierge service. Actually amazing concierge service. Espcially Phillipe. DEFINATELY ask to be booked on the Del Dotto winery tour. They take you into the caves, it's very fun!!If you want to stay at an unusal, small, boutique, clubbish hotel, this is for you. They even start playing dance or whatever music in the elevators after a certain hour. Definately don't stay here if you want posh, quiet luxury."
284,2030,Dec 9 2005	Very Unusual Decor	Our room was at the 13th floor. The city views were great...decor was strange like a teenager's room...I'm not sure why hotels put rooms next to service elevators...it ruined the whole experience. Shower tub was dirty. Staff was nice.
285,2030,"Nov 29 2005	Great Design	Stayed over the holiday weekend with by BF, no too full or noisy. Good sized king room on the 8th floor, although the bathroom was quite small for a $300 room. The Staff was attentive and tried to accomodate our needs. Check-out time is 1pm, which was great for my throbbing headache. Beautiful common areas, Asia de Cuba serves an amazing breakfast. FYI- If you are in SF on a weekend do try SupperClub on 3rd and Harrsion, Great place for dinner, drinks and dancing."
286,2030,"Nov 27 2005	Clift is Awesome!	Wow! My husband and I spent the weekend at Clift to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and we had the most fabulous time there! We had heard many good things about this hotel and now we are singing Clift's praises as well--our room was wondeful, the bed was literally the most comfortable bed either of us have ever stayed on! Every staff member we encountered had GREAT customer service, including the maid service. The concierge staff has been &quot;right on&quot; with all their suggestions. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect weekend in San Francisco, or for a better 10th wedding anniversary anywhere. We will definitely be recommending Clift to our friends--and hopefully staying there for future anniversaries."
287,2030,"Nov 22 2005 	Most Expensive Phone Calls	The room was cute, loved Asia de Cuba but the service was terrible. They were rude and short to the customers, and I wasn't the only person saying so. And, I came here for a meeting, made a couple of phone calls within California, it ended up costing me about $12 every 3 minutes. I made 6 quick phone calls and it costed me $180! I was so appalled, I'm not even sure the company will pay for such a silly expense. This place is definitely not business-friendly."
288,2030,Nov 6 2005	Clift Is For Only Young People	It might be very interesting hotel if you are under 35 years old. It is a modern minimalist style with dark lighting at the lobby and hall way and lots of young people gethered at Asia de Cuba restaurant and bars. It is IN place at night but very laud. Rooms are clean but they did not spend money for the furnitures. I stayed in Junior suite and was not impressed at all. Bathroom is very small and plain. I think it was mistake for me to choose this hotel.
289,2030,"Oct 31 2005	Great Hotel	This is the 3rd Hotel in the Morgans Group(formerly Ian Shrager)I've stayed in. I've stayed in the Mondrian in LA and the Hudson in New York. I'm also really familar with the St Martin's Lane and the Sanderson in London - so I kind of knew what to expect.I was pleasantly surpised - this hotel, although still very funky - is a lot cosier than the other hotels in the Group. The Lobby, Bar and Restaurant (Asia de Cuba) are relatively small and panelled in dark California Redwood with a large open fireplace by reception. The overall effect is less intimitading than the other design hotels I've stayed in.The room was a decent size with a closet, smallish tv, dvd player and cd player. The bathroom is small but comfortable. The room is decorated in cream and pale lilac with accents of tangerine.The bar is very crowded but this is to be expected as its one of the places to hang-out in San Francisco.Something I appreciated were the free well equiped Gym and Business Center. Its really great to be able to use the internet without having to pay extortianate hotel fees.If you're worried about noise ask for one of the internal rooms. If you're worried about it being 'pretentious' then don't stay in a cool boutique hotel and choose one of the numerous chain hotels in San Francisco."
290,2030,"Oct 18 2005	Great designer hotel****	I loved that hotel. It's a great city designer hotel. I love good surprises and this hotel was a very good one .... the lobby is so cosy with a fireplace, next stepp were the elevators: green, violet or red mirrors ... everything is very special and bright. the rooms are so friendly even though the bathroom is small it's still very comfy. And there is no ikea furniture as a user wrote, it's Philippe starck!!!The bar (made of redwood) seems to be THE place to be in San Francisco so it is very crowded, but it's great. We didn't have dinner at the Asia de Cuba restaurant, but it looked perfect. The more you look at the details of this hotel the more you will love it. everything is so special.Staff is friendly too and they look good!! It's not the kind of staff and service you'll have in a classic 4-5 star hotel like ritz, this is a new generation hotel. Oh yes and the room rate is not expensive at all!! for what you get. we had very bad and old furnished hotels on our california tour which cost a lot more!Right next door you have the Grand Caf (restaurant / brasserie) which serve excellent seafood and wine .... To end this review: if you like design, fashion, perfect location... this is the hotel for you..."
291,2030,"Oct 1 2005 	Overall a nice a hotel	Ok, I have mixed feelings about The Clift...first of all it's not well marked from the street and as a vistor in SFO, trying to navigate the streets you fly right past it...but after you walk through the cool lobby with its dark wood and bar area, you will either say Wow this is cool or Oh no, this is not for me...I loved the ambiance of the clift....The beds were great, my room was nice/spacious(both rooms), the gym is small, the front desk is forgetful and the doormen are well...nice to look at! Anyway, I went out to SFO early, spending the weekend before a conference doing the 17 mile drive and Napa day trips. Because of my day trips I arrived late to the hotel, after 9pm. With this in mind I called the hotel to let them know to hold my non smoking king room...I will be checking in late. Of course when I got to the hotel on my first night, I was given the key to a double bed, smoking room. I was upset but jet lagged and tired so, with promises that they will change my room tomorrow, I went to bed. We were visting Napa and leaving early the next morning so I called to inquire about the move and they told me to pack and they would move me...and when I got in that night just stop by the desk and pick up my new room key. Well you know what happened...when I got in from Napa, I met blank stares at the front desk about my move. After about 10 mins a decision was made to upgrade me to a suite...Hey that suited me just fine...There was really no other decision they could make after 2 mistakes. The location is Great, the drinks are great, the atmosphere is cool if not a little snobby but smile and they will smile with you. If you want to stay at a happening, sophisticated place then the Clift is for you. One last thing, have breakfast at Max's 1 block down. Great food!"
292,2030,"Sep 29 2005	You Got To Be Kidding !!!	I knew i was in for trouble when I discovered that the hotel had no signage to identify itself (pretentious , not cool). The room was a decent size (we had a deluxe) although the bathroom was a joke (I have never seen a smaller one in a hotel)The IKEA plexiglass orange furniture, small TV, lack of drawers and hard bed didnt help. If you are there on the weekend be prepared for even more noise (allot of traffic noise even on the 8th fl.)than usual.The $51.65 for parking (they charge tax on parking) was insulting enough but it took 1/2 hr to get our car on a Sunday morning.The lobby, bar and restaraunt are all unique but dont come close to making it worth it.If you are young (under 30) and painfully hip this may be the place for you otherwise go elsewhere."
293,2030,"Sep 26 2005	great room service	my boyfriend and i spent a week at the clift and could not fault a single thing. the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room service was so good that we hardly bothered going out to eat and the bed was huge and one of the most comfortable i have ever slept in. we had a room overlooking the street but had no problems with noise. i always like to try different hotels but if we returned to san francisco i would not hesitate in staying at the clift again."
294,2030,Sep 19 2005	Stay at the Clift? I don't think so	We stayed for a few nights after a disastrous time down the road at the Adagio. We were greeted by a receptionist who just wasn't really interested. We stayed on the 4th floor with the Guiness Book of Records smallest bathroom but once you got over that the room was nice enough. We went to bed that night and had the worst nights sleep. The noise was unbelivable! from other guests and security knocking on doors. It seems no sooner had we drifted off then the prompt 'Room Service' started. We thought that becuase this was a Saturday night it was going to be a one off but unfortunately this appeared to be the way things were throughout our stay.In addition the redwood bar requires reservations if you would like to sit down in it. We didn't have one as paying guests were offered to sit outside the bar in the reception area with the draft from the front door as company. Come on!
295,2030,"Sep 13 2005	Wonderful if you get a deal and use some helpful hints	I was very pleased with my experience at the Clift, although I am glad I read this website before getting there. The room was pleasant and clean. The bed and linens were so comfortable. And the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.Firstly, my husband and I arrived at the hotel at 9:30 in the morning, and they let us check in early (no added fee). Our bellman chatted with us the entire way up about cool places to go and see while in town. And when we wanted directions to drive to Muir Woods, they already had them printed out and found them for us very quickly. For people who were dissatisfied with their visit, I think you have to know what you are getting into. This is a hip, trendy spot that caters to people who fancy themselves as hip and trendy. This is NOT a family oriented place where you spend the afternoon with your kids hanging out by the pool.That being said, the picetag for this hotel is slightly excessive... we got a deal through orbitz where our room ended up costing about $150/night for a 3 night stay (fri to mon), and I would have been annoyed if we had paid full price for the stay. Also, the bahroom is small, but as my husband and I are pretty thin and short, so it didn't bother us at all.Some helpful tips:1. Ask for an interior or courtyard room. We did, and they were happy to oblige us with one on the 4th floor... we heard NO traffic noise.2. Don't park here if you can help it... it is overpriced! We rode the BART into town and walked the few blocks to the hotel, then rented a car only for the day we needed it at Enterprise at the Nikko Hotel (about 3 short blocks away) for $25/day and returned it the same day so we didn't need to pay for parking. Alternatively, there is a lot 1/2 a block down the street on Taylor where they'll park your car for $18 overnight.3. The hotel restaurant is also overpriced... skip it and try Scala's Bistro at the Sir Francis Drake hotel on Powell. The meals at Scala's excellent in quality. The portion size is perfect (NOT huge so there is room for dessert). 4. Place the Do Not Disturb tag on your doorknob if you want to sleep in. The cleaning crew are serious about their business and came around at 8am to check the room, and again at 9am to see if we were gone so that they could clean the room.5. $10 for ethernet connection?!??!?!? You can walk to union square and use the free wi-fi while sitting outside and enjoying the park."
296,2030,Sep 9 2005 	loved the experience	Definitely will stay at this hotel again next time. A bit pricy but worth it.. Staffs were helpful and kind. Beautiful room. Nice location.. Make sure you have breakfast at Taylor street coffee shop a block down the taylor street.
297,2030,"Sep 6 2005	Not a 4 star	We just got back from a 4 night stay at the Clift in a one bedroom suite. We had quite a few problems at the hotel. It started with the condition of the room, there were stains on the furniture, stains on the floor, paint chipped off the doorways and walls (the room looked beat up.) The whole hotel was beat up, it needed a lot of repairrs, everywhere you looked there was a stain. or paint missing or a dent, there was something wrong everywhere. The room was large but the furniture was extremely uncomfortable. The bathroom was the tiniest thing I've ever seen at a hotel. It was 1/2 the size of my powder bath at home. I read one persons review which stated that the Clift had the most comfortable bed they had ever slept on, and that influenced my decision on where to stay, let me tell you, the beds were the hardest!!!!! beds I've ever slept on in my life, one night I slept on the floor they were so bad. My husband and I did not get one goods night sleep there. OUr backs hurt for several days because of the awful beds. I told the receptionist upon check out about the horrible beds and she said she gets that complain a lot!!!! Luckily, we did not stay too long in the room because the decor was horrible, too much orange plexiglass(the coffee table, the dining table, the nightstands, &amp; parts of the furniture were painted orange.)Also the Concierge(s) were the most unhelpful people ever. We were traveling with 2 small children and asked him which amusement park would be better for our young kids (Paramount or Great Adventure.) He said defitantely Great adventure. He called the park and told us they were closed that day. On our way to do something else, I told my husband I know the park is open b/c I researched it before we left so we called and Yes, the park was open, so we went and they had a couple of rides for the kids. 2 days later we decided to take them to Paramount, and wow this park was incredible for our aged kids, they could go on almost every ride by themselves, and this is the park the concierge did NOT recommend. Also, the Clift claims to be a kid friendly hotel, they do not have children's menus, we did not get popcorn and a toy the first night of arrival (as promised) and their stroller situation is a joke. They claim they rent strollers. Well, we tried to rent one and they had no idea what we were talking about, finally someone in housekeeping called us and said they have 1, don't know where it is, but will try to find out. About 1 1/2 hours later they called to tell us they found it but it had a flat. They eventually fixed it and I told them we needed 2 strollers and they said we only have 1 stroller to rent. Also, the concierge(s) had 3 places to recommend for dinner with kids, and every night they could not get us into the place the reommended!I was very disappointed with the hotel, it was just not upkept well and the furniture was the worst!!! I would never stay at the Clift again."
298,2030,"Sep 1 2005	Poor Service small dimly lit rooms	Definitely not worth the money. This hotel is far from luxury class. The bathrooms are poorly designed in relation to the bedroom and very tiny. Our room was not made up inbetween nights. Overall, I found the rooms uncomfortable."
299,2030,"Aug 29 2005	Somewhat Dissapointed	For the price, I have to say that this place is average. The dimly lit entrance way, bar and restaurant area set a very relaxed, sexy atmpsphere and perhaps if that vibe was carried up to the actual floors of the hotel then it would work better but after the elevators open to your floor your eyes are surprised to see lilac hallways with white trim (reminded me of a dollhouse)- I never thought I'd be one to care about these things much but it just doesn't go and the color is just ugly. Also, noise travels throught the rooms. My room looked identical to the person before me who posted the pics - small for the price and bed wasn't that comfy. I have to say though, I thought the staff was very nice and overly accomodating. Also in a good area - accessible to everything. I probably won't go back because it is expensive for what it is but would def stop in for a drink at the Redwood Bar - very cool hotel (downstairs that is)."
300,2030,"Aug 24 2005	Like the others have said...	....the Clift is ok, but it is not a good value for the money and the rooms and bathroom are small!!My incredible girlfriend booked a room for us at the Clift couple weeks ago for a night in the city. After having spent a weekend at the Hotel Vitale across town a month ago we had high expectations for a room in this price range. As others have mentioned there is no name on the hotel, (thanks for making me take that extra spin around the block in friday afternoon traffic Clift) so you need to really look out for it, and there is little room at the curb to park for the overpriced valet! (more on that later)Check in was smooth, friendly staff, quick with luggage and the door. Room was nice, some of the furnishings are kinda cheapy, tv and lamps etc. Bed was nice, sheets were nice, best part of the room. Bathroom is ok, very small but nicely done I guess, slow draining tub, but did have awesome water pressure....never seen anything so powerful!!Went to the Redwood Room before dinner elsewhere, a Pale Ale and a mixed drink was $22.....yeah that speacialty drink was good.....but come on....bar staff ok, could be more attentive!They gave us a late check out to 2pm, that was nice, service overall was good. Had a longer wait getting the car back from Valet , and $45 to park a car overnight plus another $7 in tax is just too much. Clift is ok, but not a good value for the money, we will probably not go back."
301,2030,"Aug 10 2005	Great Hotel - Classy People	The room is immaculate. Crisp, white bed linen.The staff make the hotel!!!They are always well presented (and all of them are extremely attractive), very polite and very helpful.Will be back soonbtw - the crowd at the bar is very classy, be prepared to meet some very interesting people"
302,2030,"Jul 29 2005	Nice Hotel Expensive Parking	The Clift Hotel was conveniently located to Union Square, Trolley Stops, etc. The rooms were a bit small, but still comfortable. The decor of the hotel is amazing. The service was great, and concierge was very helpful. On the down side, we chose to valet park before finding out how much it costs. We were suprised to find out that it was $45 plus 14% city tax. There is a parking garage right around the corner that is $18 to $20 plus 25% city tax. The only downside of that garage is that you have no in/out privileges, which you do have at the Clift. Overall, the hotel was a great experience - we would return!"
303,2030,"Jul 18 2005	nice hotel excellent location	first let me start by thanking the previous reviewers who noted that the hotel is completely umarked from the street, if they hadnt said that i would have driven around for ever looking for it. now on to the actual review. when in sf i usually stay at the hilton that is near the cliff but i got an excellent deal on the clift so i decided to give it a try. the clift is a nice hotel, the location is excellent, close to union square and market st. the room was decent sized and bright a furnished in a very &quot;ikea-esque&quot; way. the staff was curteous and friendly. all in all, a nice hotel, i dont think i would pay full price there but if you can get a good deal there, then by all means go for it."
304,2030,"Jul 12 2005	Excellent Hotel!	Had a great stay! Love the white linens - very clean. Great looking and friendly staff - will be back!!!Phillipe, thanks for recommending Townhall. We have great pictures of us in &quot;the chair&quot;."
305,2030,"Jun 2 2005	Not worth the $$$	This was my first trip to San Francisco. Needless to say I haven't stayed in any of the other hotels in this area of town, so I don't know how the Clift compares. No trouble locating the hotel, though I was a little more vigilant after reading about others' troubles finding it. Checking in was a breeze. the front desk was not busy at the time and the staff were courteous and helpful. The room was fairly small and had been redecorated, but the furnishings looked rather cheap. The bathroom is ultra-small, it looks like the vanity, mirror, tile, and possibly the shower/tub are new. The toilet looks like something out of a public restroom. The bed was one of the more comfortable ones that I've slept in. The gym was surprisingly adequate, consisting of 4 treadmills, 2 stationary bikes, 2 steppers, a full set of dumbbells (5-110 lbs), flat bench, incline bench, and a cybex multi-station. Overall, I wasn't super-disappointed, but I felt that for the money that I was paying the quality of the room should've been much better. On my next visit, I'm going to explore other options."
306,2030,"Jun 1 2005	Absolutely perfect!	After booking a room, I went onto travel advisor, and was a little worried about the Clift. Here is my experience over Memorial weekend. Upon entering the hotel, my fiance and I were warmly greeted by both the doorman, and the front desk staff. The room was booked on Expedia, and was Huge!! The room was immaculately clean and gorgeously appointed. There were Frette sheets and robes, and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in a hotel, and I travel for a living. The sink area was huge enough for both of our toiletries, as well as ample shelf space below. The shower was like standing under a waterfall. I couldn't believe how much water was coming out! The inbath supplies were very nice. I read a lot about noise, but you could hear a pin drop every second we were in our room, and we were there for Memorial Weekend. The tv was a little small, but WHO CARES... We were there to see San Francisco. We never ate in the hotel but had cocktails in the Redwood Room, and it is something else. Sure the drinks are expensive, but it was great, and the bartenders were really friendly. I honestly don't know what all of the complaints are about. The Clift is fantastic. Can't wait to return, and HIGHLY reccomend."
307,2030,"Jun 1 2005	Disappointing. Not worth it. Not cute anymore.	The only good thing about the Clift was the comfortable bed. The rooms are small, and the decor is plain. The crowd is no longer cute. Forget the front desk. It is simply not worth the price. The Clift is over."
308,2030,"May 23 2005	Don't stay here unless you get a really good rate on the room	The decor in the lobby and bar of this hotel is very interesting and modern, and the location is ideal. Also, I was able to check in a couple hours early, which was much appreciated. Everything else was pretty much a thumbs down. First, the hotel has no sign or other identifying marks, requiring much circling around aimlessly. The room was tiny and difficult to maneuver around, leading to many bruises on my leg from the bed frame. The bathroom, as others have noted, ------. The television was tiny and somewhat pathetic (I realize we were not in San Francisco so that we could watch TV, but still). The parking was ridiculously expensive and fairly inconvenient. We even had a voucher for a significant discount on the daily rate, but of course they did not honor it initially, requiring that my already unreasonably long check-out time involve some uncomfortable haggling over whether they would actually honor it (leaving me feeling like somewhat of a cheapskate, but come on -- $46.50/night ($40 for parking and $6.50 &quot;parking tax&quot;)?! That is scandalous). The waitress in the lobby lounge was horribly rude and pretty much went out of her way to ignore us, brought me a completely undrinkable cocktail that I had no choice but to return (something I've never ever done), and of course overcharged us at the end of the miserable ordeal, again requiring me to &quot;negotiate&quot; the bill so that we only had to pay for what we ordered and received (as opposed to the things we ordered but never actually got). All in all, it was an okay experience, but certainly did not live up to my expectations for a purportedly nice hotel. Had the weather not been so beautiful and my vacation not otherwise so enjoyable, I might have been more annoyed at my experience at the Clift."
309,2030,"May 16 2005	All Looks and No Brains	I've stayed at the Clift twice now, and both times my experience was mixed. The hotel itself looks great--it has clean cool lines, high ceilings, big windows, comfortable beds. A standard room is pretty small. I stayed in a corner room suit for three nights---the room is all glamour, and filled with light, and good views. Service however, is poor, spotty, and mostly indifferent. The staff at the front desk seem overburdened with phone calls, and handling guests--I always found them harried, and rushed--and not warm. At five hundred dollars a night (for a one bedroom suit)--I expect some kind of service. (the Ritz-Carlton, even though covered in chintz, has great service)In the absense of good service, I would at least appreciate a staff that were warm, and who could exhibit a modicum of charm in such a beautiful hotel.I would say that the best way to describe the hotel would be this, that she is like a beautiful girl at a party, who has nothing to say."
310,2030,"Apr 23 2005 	Poor Delivery!	Overpriced, Attitude and for what ???Go accross the street to the Monaco or back to the &quot;W&quot;The Clift is all wrong."
311,2030,"Apr 6 2005	Hated it	Very snobby staff, very small rooms (even if you get a suite), high room tax, expensive parking, the people in the room next to us were smoking pot all night and the &quot;gym&quot; consists of approximately three treadmills, three stairmasters and one weight machine. The only good thing about this hotel was checking out of it."
312,2030,"Mar 31 2005	Come on Ian!!!	I've spent nights at the Delano and the Mondrian and the Clift doesnt even come close to my other experiences...For the amount of money you spend, the place was absolutely horrible ... My room was like walking into my grandmothers room and the staff was not even noticeable from the time you walked in the door to the time you checked out... very disappointing... Ian should be ashamed of himself..."
313,2030,"Mar 21 2005	Comfortable bed and great scene	After checking out of the Hotel Adagio across the street because it didn't have A/C (I barely slept the night before), the Clift Hotel turned out to be a very wise choice. I walked in at 9:30AM on Saturday and asked at the desk if they had availibility. They did and the room was ready now. What a great suprise!. We got an upgraded King room at a fair rate. The bed was very comfortable and the room was bigger than I expected with two closets. The bathroom was tight, but that is what I expected. The bar scene is the best in town and the staff was very helpful. I would definetly stay at the Clift again."
314,2030,Mar 14 2005	great decor	My husband and I stayed there for a night and the room was very nice. The bed was very comfortable we slept very good that night. We had dinner at &quot;Asia de Cuba&quot; and the food was not that great. Our food was cold and did not taste as good as other &quot;Asia de Cuba&quot; I have been to.
315,2030,"Mar 11 2005 	The hotel was nice but not up to 5 star snuff	Everyone at the Clift was great and the decore was nice. The bathroom was so small, though, and there wasn't much place to put things. They need to fine tune...."
316,2030,"Feb 7 2005	Loved it!!	Wonderful experience all around. The Clift is a fun exciting hotel! My husband, baby girl, and I stayed there for four nights in January 2005. The staff was wonderful and extremely helpful with all our baby needs!!!! We were not frowned upon taking a baby to the restaurant on a busy night, WE WERE GRACIOUSLY WELCOMED! WONDERFUL WONDERFUL. The cuisine was delicious, the rooms were very luxurious a little small but what do you expect in San francisco."
317,2030,"Jan 21 2005	Excellent	It's a scene, but isn't that what you expect when staying at one of Ian's hotels? The service was excellent and the location is conveniently in the middle of everything. The decor is beautiful yet edgy. Overall, it was a pleasurable experience."
318,2030,"Jan 15 2005	very hip decor okay staff	Locating the Clift is particularly perilous at night with all those one-way streets because the only distinguishing markers are purple windows (luckily, I remembered this from the website photos). The very hip decor is interesting (antlers on furniture, oversized chairs, animal skins, etc.), though one might be afraid that sitting on the furniture would elicit critical looks from the staff. Checking in was somewhat cumbersome due to a computer glitch, but was otherwise fine. Our room was a decent size and overlooked the street below where noise carried very well. A pity since we were staying when hotel employees were picketing outside several other hotels in the area beginning at 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. (check to see if there are still labor disputes and at which hotels). The furniture comes in light colors (white, cream, lilac, and melon) and some aren't entirely functional, like the orange plastic bedside &quot;tables&quot; that would be more useful as stepping stools. However, I do appreciate hotel design and the room was tastefully done with very clean lines, smooth textures, and solid colors. It was particularly beautiful in the morning with the sun in full force. Beware, though, that the bathrooms are indeed very small and less functional than they should be. A large mirror blankets one wall and there is a teeny wastebasket underneath the table beneath the sink. I felt so untidy because there were no drawers to contain my toiletries, which, as a result, kept rolling everywhere. The mini-bar is well-stocked with useful items that come at a hefty price (as in any hotel). The walls are so thin that I could hear my neighbor watch TV ALL night. The fitness center was much smaller than I expected, but very clean and well-equipped. The concierge was very helpful in locating a great restaurant at the last minute. The hotel really is located in the center of downtown San Francisco, making it easy to walk to Union Square, the MOMA, and other attractions. I'm from Los Angeles where I've eaten at the Asia de Cuba in the Mondrian (beautiful restaurant by the way), so I wasn't interested in dining at Asia de Cuba in the Clift. I did spot it through the glass in the Redwood Room, where you should reserve a table well in advance since standing in a tight space isn't much fun. The room is beautiful, although the LCD displays are a little eery. When returning from a late night out on a weekend, someone will probably ask to see your guest card before admitting you through the door. I actually think it's a good idea for security reasons. Overall, the staff was friendly, although a bit aloof in certain instances. The hotel is very clean and nothing is dated, for better or worse. I saw people of all ages lounging about in the public spaces. I would stay again for a partying occassion, but I don't consider it a particularly romantic hotel."
319,2030,"Jan 9 2005 	Trendy but comfortable	Hey, it's an Ian Schraeger hotel. There's going to be lots of cool oversized furniture, moody lighting, and the most attractive staff in town. If that bugs you then this is not your hotel. For the rest of you, the bed and the bedding are great. The bathrooms are nicely updated. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous. Room service, the restraunt, and the bar are fabulous. There are a million pay per view movies and in room tv internet service. I think this is a great place to stay for work or pleasure. Especially if you can get a good rate."
320,2030,"Jan 5 2005	Not your traditional hotel experience	This hotel was an &quot;experience.&quot; We stayed at this hotel with a wedding party and paid around $190/night. We thought the rates fair for a high class hotel and comparable with others in SF area. We stayed in a standard room and the bride &amp; groom were in a high-end suite so we got to experience both. The decor of the rooms is minimal and modern. White sheets and duvets with splashes of color using pillow throws, mirrors, and plexi-galss. Bathroom was small, but well appointed and clean. We liked staying here, but they are definitely snooty. There is no sign on the hotel itself, and when asked, the doormen harp on the &quot;exclusivity&quot; of the hotel. And even though we requested a table reservation at the bar for the wedding party, we did not have one when we arrived and when we finally got one, we were asked to move after 30 minutes. And the drinks are ridiculously priced. Overall, we enjoyed staying there depsite the snootiness, but might try a more reasonably priced hotel next time."
321,2030,"Jan 4 2005	Hip trendy comfortable clean and in the center of everything!	I have stayed at the Clift twice and both times had a pleasurable experience. I think that this hotel is a great place for adults - is centrally located, friendly staff, and happening lobby/bar/restaurant scene. The rooms are small but very comfortable and clean. I have stayed at many Ian S. hotels and this is one of my favorites. Its not dowdy like many of the &quot;nice&quot; San Franscisco hotels."
322,2030,"Jan 3 2005	Superb except Asia	Arrived as part of our Honeymoon world tour at Christmas\04. The Clift definitely compares well with other 5 star hotels we stayed in. I had been told we would either love it of hate it which I think is quite a fair statement. We loved it and the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because of the ASIA DA CUBA restaurant. The food is nice if not a little pricey for what you get but the staff were shocking and rude!I think the guy who served us should remember it's not his restaurant and that he just works there and if a customer is unsure what's on the Menu or what piece of cutlery to use he should be courteous not rude. The hotel room was nice but the bathroom a little small. The staff ( particularly Lyndsay) were very polite and helpful. It's also in a great location just a couple of blocks from Union Square. Lastly we had a great time in the Redwood room, drinks are pricey but you know this before you go in! All in all definitely stay but do not eat at the restaurant!"
323,2030,Dec 15 2004	Clift Hotel	Nice Hotel but overpriced.If you have a query about your bill make sure that you get an ammended and printed copy of your bill before you leave
324,2030,"Dec 10 2004	Do not stay	Tiny Rooms..Bathrooms the size of the closet...MOST OF ALL...my wife and I were asked to not sit on a particular couch, and &quot;Could we move to the seating over there&quot;?????? When asked why another couple was enjoying a glass of wine across from us...the response was &quot;they have a reservation to sit there&quot;!!!!! Amazing!!! Not to mention being stopped from entering and questioned as to what room you are staying in, your name, etc..... Save Your money--stay somewhere nice.If you must see it, go to the bar, wait 30 minutes to get a half full martini for $12, be rudely insulted by some super hip, brand new hairstyle bartender."
325,2030,"Nov 11 2004	Fabulous	I read all these bad reviews of the Clift before my trip and was apprehensive about my stay there but as it appears, people are more vocal when they are upset with a place. That's why I feel as if I need to put in my two cents. My boyfriend and I stayed there for four nights from Nov 3-7, 2004. Yes, it's true--no iron, no dresser, no fridge etc. But I've also stayed at the Hudson and it's the same situation. I think they did a great job with the amount of space they were given. And yes, the minibar is expensive, but there are 5 liquor stores within a block radius of the hotel, AND a pharmacy across the street. Not to mention the Redwood Room downstairs. (They make the best martinis).The rooms were trendy. Delicious bed---super fluffy pillows and cozy down comforters. Minimalistic furniture, curtains framing all four walls, and oh my god! There are mirrors, I'm talking floor to ceiling, on two opposing walls of the rooms so every morning I would wake up to 10 of me staring back. We couldn't help but put on a show for ourselves with a treat like that.And the staff was not snobby, like I had read. They were VERY VERY helpful and courteous. They weren' t judgemental, even when I walked in with TAKE-OUT food or snacks for the room. People of all ages would hang out in the lobby and bar area, not just San Francisco's hip and superficial. And there IS signage on the hotel. It's all the way on top of the building. You just need to look up. I know I'm getting technical, but I need to defend the CLIFT. All these people that write to say that there's no sign *wah wah wah* were too occupied looking at their feet to see it. Anyway, I had a great time. The service was wonderful. Turndown service every night. Not a hotel choice for you if you're on your honeymoon and trying to force romantic moments every second of the day."
326,2030,"Nov 4 2004	Too trendy pour moi	We stayed for two nights at either end of our honeymoon to Hawaii in October. The Clift is definitely for the young trend setter who wants to be seen staying at the trendy hotels. The entrance is difficult to locate as there is no name to indicate that its the Clift from the front. On entrance to the reception is very modern and dark, which initially I liked but trying to check in in this light is a bit difficult. I felt you needed a torch to find your way around in the lobby area. The staff were very friendly and were extremely helpful.The rooms are ultra modern again and furniture is sparse. Rooms are small and the bathrooms are tiny. Sitting on the loo you had the toilet roll up on top of you!! Again, disappointed that no tea/coffee facilities in the room, plus our safe didn't work either. Mini bar extremely expensive and they even charged for the little sewing kits that hotels normally provide.Walls are thin so if you got noisy neighbours, your in trouble. On our second night, our room was a connecting room and luckily our neighbours didn't stay up too late but when they were having breakfast the next day you could practically hear them chewing. Definitely not my cup of tea but if I was a younger hip person, would probably love it!"
327,2030,"Oct 22 2004 	Trying too hard to be cool	The once glorious Clift is now another attempt from the Morgan's group at being &quot;cool.&quot;Outrageously expensive from the mini-bar to the room rates, the rooms feature walls that are about 70 percent mirrored. This ultra-glassed-in feature is most unappealing in earthquake-prone San Francisco. Staff has major attitude and there are no irons, ironing boards or coffee pots in rooms.The beds are ok but the other furniture is uncomfortable and uninviting - if you are into Feng Shui, forget it - with mirrors and &quot;shars&quot; everywhere you will suffer nightmares as I did.There are scores of better deals for your 300 dollars a night in San Francisco than this dreary replay of a Morgan's group jail cell."
328,2030,"Oct 3 2004	The ""Old Clift"" was much nicer	We stayed at the Clift for three nights this summer (July 23 - 26, 2004). My wife and I had often stayed at the old Clift Hotel before it was taken over and renovated by the Ian Schrager group. The old Clift may have been showing its age, but it had spacious, elegantly furnished rooms in a convenient part of town. What a disappointment it was to see what has been done to this once great hotel ! We booked an Studio Jr. Suite which was described as an &quot;L&quot; shaped room. We quickly discovered that this was one of the former spacious rooms from the old Clift that we remembered so fondly, but it had been chopped up into two rooms ... creating a window-less bedroom area and very cramped sitting area. The decor makes abundant use of petroleum based synthetic materials (think plastic draperies, plastic night stands &amp; tables, plastic covered furnitiure) and has most opposing walls covered floor to ceiling with tinted mirrors. The mirrors tend to give the room a subtle feeling of nausea and the hard bench type furniture was uncomfortable. The bedding was of good quality but they must have contracted with a lumber company for the mattresses. My wife was particularly disappointed in the bathroom. It was cramped, with barely enough room for one person to turn around. There was no counter space and even the tub was scaled down to fit in such a small space. The old Clift had spacious, well appointed, marble bathrooms.The lobby and public areas have very dim lighting, which seemed stylish and attractive at first, but then became annoying. The elevator compartment was so darkened you could not even see the person standing next to you.They have even ruined the famous Redwood Room Bar. All of the warmth and intimacy of the old Redwood Room is missing, replaced by garish lighting and hard, uninviting bench type seats. The hostess greeted us at entrace with &quot;Oh .. are you here to inquire about reservations?&quot;. Acutally, we just wanted a glass of wine before going to dinner, but after seeing what has been done to the ambiance, I was almost in tears.Unless you are attacted to dark spaces and synthetic materials, I would give this hotel a pass. We certainly will not be back."
329,2030,"Sep 28 2004	Cool and trendy and too plain	Very cool place!!! The windows outside are beautiful, and the inside rockas as well...unfortunately, the rooms suck!!! They're big, that's a plus and the beds are comfy but that's about it. It's just that they contrast too greatly with the overall style of the Clift. THe lobby, restaraunt and bar are so cool and trendy that the rooms should be more than pastel purple walls with white furniture. Pretty much, if you plan on spending most of your time outside your hotel room, this place is ideal!!!!"
330,2030,"Sep 21 2004	Hip and happeningbut.......	The hotel was in a great location, was very hip and trendy and the hotel bar is The Spot to be on the weekends. But, although a lot of money had been spent a couple of years ago for remodeling, it is basically (room wise) an old hotel that got painted and furnished with IKEA furnishings. Not to say it looked bad. Maybe the higher end rooms are much better. No coffee maker in room. Tiny bath. Lobby is very nice as is restaurant and bar. Very dark inside hotel. Couldn't wait to get outside for some light. Great appetizers and staff was good. Would probably not stay again. Great bed. Would put it at 3-4 star."
331,2030,"Sep 21 2004	VVVV BAD	I went to this hotel for Valantine's Day weekend. The hotel has a nice cool entrance. Its in a very busy and nice part of SFO called Union Sqaure. The are ahs a lto fo good shops and places to eat. However, this hotel, has a small entrance that makes it look like a boutique hotel. But it really isnt, the lobby are is very loud because of the club/bar opposite the entrance. I was first booked for a junior suite, and I didnt like it at all. It was real small and for those of you who like to watch a little TV. The TV in the Junior Suite has a 15inch screen. Then I upgraded to a one bedroom suite, which wasnt that much fun either, the room was bigger, but not comfortable at all, the bathroom is clean but very small. I moved out and went to the Palace the same night, which is more like a five star hotel. If any of you want any suggestions, please dont go there...save money and you might as well stay at the Four Seasons."
332,2030,Sep 15 2004	Vacation in SF	Not great! I would not stay here again. The service was not good. Our room was lacking. We had to request an ironing board &amp; iron. We had stayed at the Mandarian Oriental and their service is exceptional. So we had expected the same here. NO WAY.
333,2030,"Sep 12 2004 	The Clift Hotel: For those who aspire to be rich and cool	but haven't quite achieved either goal. For genuine class, pampering and good hospitality, stay elsewhere. We stayed at The Clift Hotel on the basis of enjoying a drink in the Redwood Room on a previous trip to San Francisco. We are a young couple who like to dress up and we thought the bar and lobby was attractively hip. Hipper than thou as it turns out and sadly, the residential experience was completely underwhelming. Although the room was pretty enough with its diaphanous cream curtains and pale birch furniture, it was marred by stained carpets and a musty smell. The bathroom was unbelievably tiny and although I am slim, I ended up with a bruise on my thigh from from bumping against the door, which stupidly opens inward into this already small space. Also, there is no surface area for toiletries, which I guess is fine if all you travel with is your toothbrush.We were irritated by the fee for highspeed internet access and the absence of a coffee maker, the latter being a basic necessity that you could find at any 1 star motel. A further annoyance was the prominent exhibition in the room of a number of of exhorbitantly priced items for sale.Our maid was nice and friendly and the concierge was fine, but the rest of the staff were too young, unprofessional and overly concerned with posing to fully focus on the needs of guests and create a luxurious atmosphere. Although hotel workers are human beings with their own private life, that's where it should remain - private. While waiting by the front desk for the return of an item from housekeeping, I don't want to hear the receptionists chatting about their previous night's partying and how they didn't get to bed until 6 in the morning. The prices in the Redwood Room and the adjoining restaurant are terribly inflated and although the food is nice, it is not outstanding and simply not worth the money. My husband and I enjoy good things but neither of us like to be ripped off and with The Clift Hotel, you feel you are at every turn. After 3 days we moved out and checked into The Monaco next door which is where we stayed last time and is just exquisite (see the reviews here on Tripadvisor).There is nothing majorly wrong with this hotel but for the money you can do so much better. Definitely call into the Redwood Room for a pre dinner cocktail and to admire the video installations, but stay somewhere else."
334,2030,"Sep 3 2004	Failed to meet expectations	The Clift hotel failed to meet my expectations and is was a major dissappointment. It is definitely not a five star hotel. The general unwelcome feel one experiences upon entering the lobby is compounded by the arrogant pushy attitudes of the door staff, front desk staff, and especially the cranky concierge. They don't have a pool, there's a pungent smell on most of the floors, and you have to pay for using the internet. The hotel is dimly lighted so that visitors can't see the worn and stained carpet. The hotel becomes infested with nightclubbers at night with all these cheezy types acting like monkeys on the lobby furniture as well as keeping ourselves and the other guests annoyed with their techno music blasting from the spanish suite right next door. And then there's the hotel bar, the Redwood Room. I don't mind paying more for a fine modern bar experience but again the Clift has failed in this department. The bar is very attractive and stylish, blending the history of the old grande hotel with the modern elements in a silky smooth collage. That's where the positives end - great design, poor execution. On approaching the hostess stand guests are looked up and down before being escorted to an appropriate location. Interestingly, the more attractive the look, the more prominent the location will be. We were seated right at the bar. The sharp looking bartenders were standing around chatting and didn't notice our deep need for a drink for quite some time. On approach, I asked what their signature cocktail was. The bartender responded by asking what I usually drink (a Chopin Martini), walked away, made the drink, presented it, and said, that'll be $14. Then he asked my colleague what she wanted to drink. She opted for a bottle of becks. $8. That was our last visit to that bar."
335,2030,"Aug 13 2004	Wonderland for the Jetset	The Clift web site says the hotel is &quot;a wonderland for the jetset.&quot; It's true. I stay there often just to add some fun to business trips. So, heres a test to help you decide if Clift is right for you:Stay at Clift if:You think its cool its a stealth hotel (no sign or name on building)You can speak at least two languages (required to be truly jetset)You know Prada from DKNYYou collect frequent flyer miles on 14 different airlinesYou are willing to over look minor problems with the staff simply because they are very good lookingYou are willing to pay $15 a drink so that you can lounge in a beautiful room full of beautiful people.You have an expense accout or trust fundThe thought of owning a minivan makes your skin crawl Do NOT stay at Clift:You think its totally absurd that the hotel has no signYou are a retired librarian looking for a peaceful place to sleep and read.You are fashion-challenged (you know who you are)You collect Precious Moments figurinesYou cannot handle a bit of friendly attitude from the staff and other guestsYou find yourself asking, Who is Philippe Starck?You are on a budgetYou own a minivan"
336,2030,"Jul 30 2004 	If image is all that matters to you...	Your first clue is the lack of signage. The Clift is far too trendy to identify its location by anything so common as a nameplate visible from the street.The valet parking staff is friendly, though, assuming you can find a place for your car on the crowded curb in front of the hotel. Plan on a hefty $40 per night for valet parking.Once inside, the clever theatricality of the lobby, dining room and bar make the efforts to arrive seem worthwhile. Check-in is efficient, if not exactly friendly or welcoming.A warning, though. If you get a room with a pass-through door to the room adjacent, immediately return to the front desk and ask for or pay for a room with solid walls. I did not and my neighbors stayed up all night long playing music and entertaining guests. Despite a call from the manager at 12:30 PM and a call from myself at 3 AM, the noise continued unabated till 4:30 AM, leaving me no recourse but to spend a very early morning in the lobby. Why the lobby? Well, the night staff informed me that while they were sorry, they could not give me another room until the morning manager arrived. Three hours later he did arrive and did give me another room. According to the bell staff, there were ample empty rooms. Apparently due to my group rate, the night staff wasn't &quot;authorized&quot; to give me another room. In effect, their rules were far more important than my comfort or inconvience. So...no sleep at all at this 4-star hotel the first night.The next night of my four-night stay, a friend and I decided to investigate the bar. The hostess condescended to find us a table and with a great deal of attitude announced that we might have one in a few minutes - depending on how long we were staying!We decided we weren't nearly important enough to enjoy the gloomy darkness and thumpa-wumpa music of the bar at the Clift, so we crossed the street and discovered the delightful Cafe Grand at the equally delightful Hotel Monaco. Evidently Kimpton hotels regard guests as valued friends and Schrager properties - like the ever-so-precious Clift - do not. Unless you share the attitude, of course, and enjoy trading superior glances with the staff.I'll give the Clift ample stars for design and poseur-power. But as a fine hotel...truly, they have a lot to learn about hospitality."
337,2030,"Jul 21 2004	Unique Hotel	This comment from a previous review was what sparked our interest in the Clift: &quot;I would not recommend this hotel for families. On the weekend it is very similar to staying at a night club.&quot; The reviewer was absolutely correct. If you're planning to bring the kids to San Francisco, you may want to stay at the Hampton Inn instead. The decor at the Clift is minimalist yet fun and creative...definitely has a night-clubbish feel. The service was excellent and very friendly; we didn't experience the attitude and snobbishness mentioned in previous reviews. The sleigh bed was SO comfortable, we loved the luxury linens. Our corner room was surprisingly spacious. The hotel location was convenient. The only complaints we had were, the bathroom seemed somewhat small and valet parking seemed a little pricey. Other than that, we would definitely stay at the Clift next time we're in town!"
338,2030,May 1 2004	Terrific service Great location	We had read not-so-favorable reviews of the staff in terms of friendliness and were concerned prior to arrival. The concerns were unfounded. The service was excellent and the staff incredibly friendly. It's a fun place to stay in a great location - walking distance of China Town and Union Square shopping
339,2030,"Apr 5 2004	For something fun and different...	This place doesn't have to try too hard to be ultra hip or cool. The fact that the hotel doesn't even have to put a sign on the building or the door will tell you that. With that being said, a stay at the Clift can transport you to a hip and trendy city lifestyle, which is exactly what I wanted for a weekend getaway from suburbia. The rooms are clean, light, and tastefully decorated in a very modern style; very comfy sleigh bed with superior down and cotton bedding. I'm pretty picky about my sheets, and I was tempted to buy these to take home with me. The hotel has the bedding custom made for them and new sets are available for sale. A stay at the Clift can be pricey. This is a trendy five-star hotel after all. However, packages can be found with good discounts for people not wanting regular chain-like accomodations and adventurous to try something different. I opted for a deluxe room at the Clift and was glad I did. There were three large windows in my outside facing corner room allowing lots of light and pleasant city sounds to filter in. The Clift's location is not ideal for sweeping views; but this was acceptable with me when selecting the hotel. A nice touch to the decor of the room were the mirrors and floor to ceiling curtains adorning the walls. No need for artwork that way, just the pleasant mix of colors, fabrics, glass, and contemporary furniture. Is the decor what I might select for my home? Probably not, but the change of scenery sure was fun for a evening. The room had candles and matches ready to go and the warm indirect lighting helped make this a contemporary romantic getaway. The CD player had excellent sound and the DVD player was a nice touch. Some might find the tv a joke as it's only a 19&quot; model, but then again, I wasn't shelling out big bucks for watching tv. The location of the Clift is excellent for the theatre/shopping crowd and getting a cab is not too difficult. The front desk staff and the doormen were very friendly and helpful. The only thing keeping this stay from being an excellent experience was the breakfast at the Asia De Cuba restaurant. The decor and the food are nice, but they must have been understaffed the morning I decided to go, although the restaurant was not even 25% full. Breakfast was included with my special package rate, so this is where I was going to dine no matter what, but I expected decent, if not excellent and courteous service at such a fine restaurant. I could barely get a refill on my iced tea. The table next to mine was getting very impatient and almost downright rude about the slow service. All in all, I would steer clear of breakfast, unless it's included in your rate. Reviews for lunch and dinner seem to be better...so maybe someday I'll check it out, but with so many other choices in the city, the Asia De Cuba left a bad impression on me and it will be some time before I return to eat there. Some people leaving reviews have complained about noise, smelling smoke in the hallways, and having no dresser in the room, but I did not encounter any problem with these. I found the closet adequate for my luggage and unpacking of my necessary items so as to reduce wrinkling. As for noise, this is the CITY, not a country getaway, so I anticipated I'd hear some noise at some point in my stay, but honestly, I was never disrupted by noise in any way. I definitely rate the hotel very high in terms of a nice stay and felt I had a good value for my money."
340,2030,"Apr 1 2004	Wow! Clift is on a come back!	I had not been to Cift in about 6 months. I was up this Saturday for the night and WOW... The service blew me away. There were smiles everywhere. Every single staff person flashed me a smile and endulged my need for fun conversation. Lets face it, it has always been a cool place... but hey... San Francisco is not NYC and not Los Angeles. In San Francisco... we are all beautiful people.. and we want to be treated as such. Clift Staff have recieved the message and are delivering. Bravo... I will so be back!We ate at Cuba de Asia. Oh my gosh... The meal was incredible. We had my goddaughter with us and she is an angel... If she wasn't... I would never have taken her to this kind of restaurant. The staff went way out to make all of us feel like we were royalty. (Its not a kid place but this kid is kind of special). Our waiter Sean, I don't even know what to say. He knew every detail, spice, food texture. He was on the money! He knew when to be there and when to stay away. His recommendations were right on. He was honest, handsome, and so professional. We wanted to take him home. After dinner it was the Redwood Room. If you haven't been there, go. It is expensive but once again, the drinks are fantastic and the atomosphere.... energizing. The staff in the Redwood Room, Bar None (no pun intended), are about as good as it gets. Something is going on because the gang at Clift have seen the San Francisco Light. No more attitude here. The staff are fashionable, smart, and quite frankly cool. They went way out of their way to treat us well, make our evening fun... right down to the manager who checked in to make sure we were having a great night. The staff are still beautiful... but they make you feel the same. Something is alive and well at Clift. Stop by and check it out... you won't be sorry."
341,2030,"Mar 14 2004	Great place	While flying to San Francisco, I was reading James Patterson's new book and one of the scenes was at The Clift Hotel. He describes the hotel well - it's very unique. The rooms are lavendar with white decor - I understand the hotel was recently renovated. The room was very clean - the only recommendation I have is more lighting.The food and service were excellent in the Asia de Cuba, but rather expensive.I would recommend this hotel and plan to stay there again."
342,2030,"Mar 10 2004	Great Hotel for the Trendy	This hotel was great. The service was abosultely magnificent. The concierge did their best to meet our demands at any time of day for certain day trips. The whole staff was very helpful and the lounge was excellent. It got quite packed on Friday and Saturday nights, which was good to see. I loved how they made the wood work with purple. Both my fiancee and I said to ourselves that it was not a combination that we thought would work but did. This hotel is very dark, but I thought it was great for that whole cool vibe. If you are looking for a trendy, upscale hotel then I would definitely recommend staying here. If you are more of a traditional, upscale hotel then this is not for you."
343,2030,"Mar 1 2004	Super cool	We chose this hotel because of our experience of the Sanderson and St. Martin's Lane in London (which we love). Although the hotel was really cool I didn't think that it was quite up to the standard of the other two hotels. Our room was a good size and we were upgraded on arrival which was a nice touch, however we did find both the room and bathroom very grey and gloomy in colour and the lighting was poor. It wasn't quite as luxurious as I might have liked. The bar was great (although the service was slow), but the music was far too loud and in your face. It might be cool, but it didn't make for a particularly pleasant or relaxing atmosphere. The staff were attentive and friendly throughout."
344,2030,"Feb 11 2004	Overrated	We stayed at The Clift in August 2004. Although the design of the hotel is pretty cool the rooms lack general comfort due to the size, they are very small. The staff are very unfriendly and unhelpful I barely saw a smile between them. They must have been trained to be off hand and dismissive. When we checked out we left our car there and gave instructions as to when and who was collecting it. When the guy went to collect the car nobody had any idea about it and sent him on his way - very annoying and costly! The one thing we did enjoy was the bar, well designed cool and funky. Great for people watching and partying."
345,2030,"Jan 9 2004	perfect hip hotel...incredible room	i stayed 3 nights at Clift in early september and was very pleased. i was checking in late, around 7 pm, so was surprised when the desk agent said the room was not yet clean, and would be about 30 minutes. i was meeting freinds for dinner and didn't relish a wait in the lobby. the agent said that he could offer me another room that was ready immeadiately, but that this was a special room and would be worth the wait....i waited.....it was AMAZING. on the top floor corner (#1701). a little odd because the elevator only goes to 16, then you have to go up a little curving staircase to 17. a huge corner room with a little entryway with a floor to ceiling curtain, very high ceilings, large panorama windows on both sides with incredible city views, a wet bar with sink, large dressing room and a windowed bathroom. get this room if at all possible. every staff member from bell boys to room service remarked that this is their favorite room. not a bad price for a room like this either. i found all the staff very freindly and helpful from front desk to valet to very informative concierge. room had internet TV with wireless keyboard which was a nice touch. fantastic lighting, fabrics, furniture. all up to par with the style and professionalism of schrager hotels. used the gym which was perfect. modern treadmills with tv's. redwood room and asia de cuba are always a scene if you want that. great location near union square. this room certainly made the stay at Clift a pleasure. not sure what the comments are in other reviews about it not really being a 5 star hotel. if they are looking for a classic 5 star experience, go to the four seasons or the carlyle. schrager hotels are consistently very clean, very well put together and comfortable and stylish and efficient and lots of fun to stay in. always worth the money in my book. perhaps not the right fit for an older timid crowd that's not looking for or expecting this experience. i enjoyed it very much."
346,2030,"Jan 4 2004	STAY AWAY! RUDE! CROOKED HOTEL! AWFUL!	The Clift Hotel is a piece of trash! The idiot doorman at the front would rather scratch his head than help you get your bags. The receptionists are completely oblivious to provide any service. Go to the W or any where else in San Francisco. This hotel is certainly not worth anything over 80 dollars. We had a horrible time, the rooms are embarrasingly small. Absolutely no amenities. The hotel changed the room rate once we arrived at the hotel and demanded we pay the new, exorbitant amount. The facilities were absolutely abyssmal.Avoid this hotel and save your money. Go anywhere else."
347,2030,"Dec 5 2003	Not Quite 5 Star	Though my stay at the Clift was most delightful, I was surprised at the absence of luxury in some of the amenities and services. The quality of the towels and robes, for example, were not quite up to par for a 5-star hotel. Not exactly the softest Egyptian cotton. The bathroom was also so small that I could barely open the door to get out of it. The service at the restaurant and bar was also a bit lackluster -- I waited over 15 minutes in the main bar before anyone came to take my order. However, all of the door men and front desk clerks were extremely helpful and friendly. Plus, the dark lighting and rich fabrics of the lobby provided a great end of the day escape from work."

It is a welcome respite from a busy day in the city, both the lobby lounge and the rooms are incredibly comfortable and the staff is welcoming. A great choice for travelers looking for a hip, progressive, yet friendly hotel."
349,2030,"Nov 14 2003	Stay Away!	My husband and I booked our stay through Expedia - I guess the Clift keeps its &quot;real&quot; rooms for guests paying full price. We could hear EVERYTHING from the next room (snoring, T.V., phone conversations, etc...). Not at all impressed. We've stayed at some pretty high-end, 5-star hotels and the Clift definitely wasn't one of them. We were not impressed with the hotel staff - I guess they're underpaid.Stay away."
350,2030,Nov 9 2003	Worthless	I usually stay at Campton Place but decided to give the Clift a try for a change of scenery. The service was not up to the level that it should be for a hotel that purports to be of such a high level. The rooms were decent. The food was bad. There wasn't an available porter to take my bags. The concierge gave me inaccurate information and I missed breakfast. I wouldn't go back. I'll return to Campton Place where the level of service is high and the food is great.
351,2030,"Nov 8 2003	Stylish and reasonable	I have to base this review on the price we paid because I think we got a cracking deal only paying $140 a night for 4 nights. This place is ultra cool, the rooms are not huge but beautifully designed as is the entire hotel. Ignore the review that says you can park in SF for $10 as the going rate for overnight is about $29 so whilst $40 for valet parking is not cheap it isn't exhorbitant by SF standards. The hotel is great for Union Square with just a 5 minute walk on the flat (unusual for SF) and it has a great bar that attracts the great and the good from the city. Staff were very helpful and overall we had no complaints whatsoever."
352,2030,"Oct 14 2003	Love those pillows!	We just returned from a wonderful weekend in SF. Our stay at the Clift was great. The only thing that I can really criticize is the 5 star rating given to this hotel. I find it more on par with a 4 star. 5 star ratings to me should be luxurious, with amenties and services that go above the expected. This hotel does not have those features. The rooms are small but adequate, as are the bathrooms. We were forewarned about the lack of a dresser and/or drawers! However, that bed and those pillows made up for all these things. Good location, a good place to see and be seen."
353,2030,"Sep 22 2003	Loved it	We just stayed at the Clift 9-13 through 9-20. The staff was wonderful we were given two upgrades, we ended up on the top floor in a corner room, that was huge and had amazing views. The staff was very helpful, courteous, and very friendly. The city itself was very nice, a little dirty, that could be improved. The hotel is in a nice location in the middle of everything. The bed was nice and comfy. The hotel is very modern looking with a young and hip crowd at night. We will be back for sure, a true gem of San Francisco"
354,2030,"Sep 2 2003	Worth the $175 price tag	We wanted a romantic escape and the Clift was quite appropriate. This is an old, traditionally built hotel that has been repainted and jazzed up with fun colors and theatrical lighting. The Redwood Room was charming with moving pictures on the walls just like in Harry Potter's Hogswarts school. The rooms were decent sized and very comfortable indeed and the decor minimalist yet pleasing. Minibar items are outrageously priced so bring your own. Room service is also outrageous - Asia de Cuba's appetizers begin at $18-22. I suggest for this price you are better off with a romantic and scrumptious 3 course meal at Gary Danko for $55. The front desk service was not very friendly - it caters to an &quot;in&quot; crowd and since we didn't look like Wallpaper models with an entourage, nobody really paid us any attention."
355,2030,Aug 20 2003	Great Service with	I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Clift. I had my reservations of staying at The Clift after reading some negative feedback on this site. After the first night I knew I was staying in a hotel that values their customers.I would not recommend this hotel for families. On the weekend it is very similar to staying at a night club. The long lines outside to get into the Redwood Room identifies the popularity of this night club. Yet you would never know there is a night club below you with very well insulated room.The room was clean and very posh. The beds have silky sheets and very romantic lighting. This is an older hotel but everything is nicely updated.The staff is very friendly and approachable. Anywhere you see a staff member they always smile and say hello. I would highly recommend consulting with the Concierge to help with transportation and advice on restaurants.I highly recommend Clift for couples wanting a romantic stay in San Francisco. I would also recommend room service. Expensive but great food.
356,2030,"Aug 12 2003	Amazing Service!	We just got back from our Clift Hotel experience and it was awesome. I cannot stress enough how friendly and helpful the staff was. We received great recommendations, everything from the best way to get to the hotel from the airport from where to go for great meals! The experience at the Clift was exceptional and I would go back."
357,2030,"Jul 29 2003	Like Sleeping On A Cloud	My partner and I stayed at The Clift June 26 - 30, 2003 for Pride Weekend. We got an excellent rate through Expedia and were very pleased at most everything the hotel had to offer. Pros: Luxury bedding which makes everything else seem less significant. Artistic, creative, furnishings and details (visit the hotel's website and you may understand the artistic vision). Excellent view (ask for a corner room on the highest floor available). Extremely clean room. Very polite and attractive looking staff (always opened doors and smiling). Would have loved to visit the Redwood Room but was too busy elsewhere. Excellent location near Union Square, cable cars, subway, restaurants, theaters. Cons: It was unusually hot weekend for SF and the air in the room wasn't circulating too well. Bathroom did not seem to have a circulation fan. Room service provides any ice you need upon request but would have preferred to get my own after having to have it brought to us about 10 times. All in all an excellent place to stay if you appreciate good taste, creativity, and romance in the greatest city on the planet. Have Fun!"
358,2030,"Jul 24 2003	The Clift Hotel is Fabulous!	Words cannot express how fabulous our stay was at The Clift Hotel! We were originally booked on the club level of the Ritz Carlton for our stay (@$375 a night) and when we checked in, the room was awful! It looked like a Hampton Inn room complete with a ceiling leak and dust on the furniture. We immediately left and switched to The Clift. Our stay was glorious. The room was large and the beds (great sheets!) were very comfortable. The fitness center was small, but top-notch equipment and the business center was excellent. The hotel is in the perfect location, a block away from Union Square. Also, as an early riser, I would wake up and go to Starbucks across the street, leaving my husband and kids in the room. Then, I would go to the Fitness Center where I enjoyed the best stairmaster ever--Cybex 800. I was in heaven for 5 nights! The staff was kind, hip and happy -- the concierge, Phillipe, was beyond compare. This is the perfect hotel in our opinion and I'm sorry its gotten such sporadic reviews. We are sold on the Ian Schrager hotels and when we have the opportunity, we will stay in them!"
359,2030,"Jul 22 2003	Funky Fun	I believe that one's experience of the Clift depends upon one's expectations. I think the Clift delivers what it promises.I stayed there for three nights. The staff was friendly and beautiful. They were nothing but helpful. The door was opened for me everytime, my clothes were pressed and returned to me immediately, and the clerk was very welcoming after our long flight from Florida.The decor trendy and fun. Yes, the lobby was dark, but I felt that added to the intimate atmosphere in the well lit acloves and added a nice backdrop for the warm glow of the candles.The rooms were small, but decorated nicely. The bed was very comfortable.If you want the Holiday Inn experience then stay at the Holiday Inn. If you want to have a fun, casual, urban experience then the Clift is for you."
